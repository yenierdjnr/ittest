          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.655\n[SOUND] In this segment,\nwe're gonna do an overview of our\n\n2\n00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:11.934\nupcoming Antivirus/Anti-malware show.\n\n3\n00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:14.680\nNow, Wes,\nwhat is this show all about for us?\n\n4\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.360\n>> We're gonna be taking a look at some\nvery important software inside of your\n\n5\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.500\ncomputing environment.\n\n6\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.230\nWe're gonna be looking at things like\nantivirus solutions on the consumer side,\n\n7\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.480\nwe're gonna be looking at antivirus\nsolutions on an enterprise side and\n\n8\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.530\ntalking about a lot of the components and\nsome of the major components that you're\n\n9\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.440\ngonna see inside of an anti-malware and\nan antivirus solution.\n\n10\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.900\n>> Awesome, so who would you say is our\ntarget audience that would really need to\n\n11\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.400\nbe watching this series?\n\n12\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.230\n>> Well I would say that there's a couple\nof target audiences if you will.\n\n13\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.440\nIn some of the portions we're gonna be\nlooking things that you can use inside\n\n14\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.680\nof a home environment.\n\n15\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.200\nWell, if you just are in a home\nenvironment, you're not in the corporate\n\n16\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.820\nworld, you're not in computing\ninside of a work environment,\n\n17\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.840\nwell that's going to be for you too.\n\n18\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.010\nBut then we're also going to look at\nsome enterprise-level solutions, and if\n\n19\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.490\nyou're on a security team or maybe you're\nthinking about joining a security team,\n\n20\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.380\nyou want to be familiar with some of\nthe products that scale up to a very large\n\n21\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.130\nenvironment, well this is also going to be\nsomething that you should stick and watch.\n\n22\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.282\nSo, we've got two different\naudiences here, and I think when\n\n23\n00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:22.400\nit comes down to it, Dan, both audiences\nare going to gain some benefit out of it.\n\n24\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.610\n>> Yeah, I totally agree.\n\n25\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.420\nNow what's a,\n\n26\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.983\nwhat are some of the specific topics\nthat we're going to jump into?\n\n27\n00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.938\nJust so our audience, or the people that\nare watching this are going to know,\n\n28\n00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:33.180\nhey that might look interesting and\nwhet their appetite.\n\n29\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.320\n>> Sure, so if you think about antivirus,\nanti-malware, well we need to start\n\n30\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.150\nwith some of the basic definitions on\nwhat malware even is, what is a virus?\n\n31\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.230\nSo, we're gonna start very basic.\n\n32\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.810\nWe're gonna start just informing you on\n\n33\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.370\nsome of the things that\nyou need to watch out for.\n\n34\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.800\nWhy do you even need this software?\n\n35\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.020\nWell, we're gonna show you\nwhy you need the software and\n\n36\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.510\nsome of the things that can\ngo wrong on your computer.\n\n37\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.250\nOr I should say, the things that you can\nget on your computer that can cause havoc.\n\n38\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.497\nThe other things that we're gonna look at\nis some of the consumer-grade software.\n\n39\n00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:08.600\nConsumer-grade software being\nstuff that sometimes free,\n\n40\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.130\nsometimes is a subscription, but\nit doesn't scale up in a large\n\n41\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.600\nenvironment and you can use it\non your everyday home networks.\n\n42\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.150\nThen we're gonna move on to a little\nbit more advanced concepts.\n\n43\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.660\nWe're gonna move into technologies that\nrequire a lot more infrastructure.\n\n44\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320\nWe're gonna have to have servers involved.\n\n45\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.180\nYou can have multiple workstations.\n\n46\n00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.790\nWe're gonna talk about things\nlike centralized management and\n\n47\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.640\nwhat that means to us.\n\n48\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.730\nVersus contrasting inside of a home\nenvironment where maybe it's not so\n\n49\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.190\nimportant that we get that.\n\n50\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.690\nAnd we're also gonna talk about some\nthings that you can use in order to\n\n51\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.580\nremediate your devices,\nif you will, if you end up\n\n52\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.420\nhaving things like computers shut down\non you cuz the viruses won't start up.\n\n53\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.060\nWell, we're gonna show you some\ntechnologies that can help you\n\n54\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.850\nremediate that type of problem as well.\n\n55\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.540\n>> Awesome, now a lot of the series\nthat we do here at ITpro TV don't map to\n\n56\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.570\na specific exam.\n\n57\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.070\nIs this one of those series?\n\n58\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.140\n>> No,\nthis isn't really gonna map to any exam,\n\n59\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.914\nthis is going to be more\nof a tech skills series.\n\n60\n00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:13.240\nIt's gonna be really just for everybody,\nso if you're looking for certifications or\n\n61\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.980\nan exam format, that's not gonna be this.\n\n62\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.950\nWe're gonna look at all\ndifferent kinds of software.\n\n63\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.720\nWe've got, I mean, a couple of handfuls\nof different technologies, but\n\n64\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.310\nnot really mapping to any one\nspecific exam or any one vendor.\n\n65\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.950\nBut if that's something that you like,\n\n66\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.860\nI'll tell you what tech\nskills are the way to go.\n\n67\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.210\n>> NAS is very awesome.\n\n68\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.776\nNow if that sounds interesting to you,\n\n69\n00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:38.210\nwell then be sure to join\nus in these upcoming shows.\n\n70\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.679\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.008\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're gonna be diving into the wonderful\n\n4\n00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.087\nworld of antivirus and anti-malware.\n\n5\n00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:25.587\nAnd with me to help us along our journey\nis gonna be my good friend Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:26.421\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n7\n00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:27.172\n>> Going good, man.\n\n8\n00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:31.039\nIt's good to be here back in the studio,\nand we've got some good stuff on tap for\n\n9\n00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:31.628\nyou today.\n\n10\n00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.587\nWe're gonna be moving into what,\nwell like what Mike said.\n\n11\n00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:35.962\nWhat is antivirus?\n\n12\n00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:36.545\nWhy do we need it?\n\n13\n00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:38.296\nWhy is it relevant to our environment?\n\n14\n00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:42.933\nAs you know, security's gonna be\nimportant to making sure devices,\n\n15\n00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.671\nyour networks stay safe.\n\n16\n00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.504\nAnd we first have to start\nout with some of the basics.\n\n17\n00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.864\nIf you've never been in\na security industry,\n\n18\n00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:54.504\nmaybe you're a relatively new user,\nmaybe you're new to computing.\n\n19\n00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:58.837\nSo some of this information for some\nof you might be really just monotonous.\n\n20\n00:00:58.837 --> 00:01:00.421\nIt might be something\nthat you've heard before.\n\n21\n00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.174\nBut if you haven't heard this information\nbefore you even dive into antivirus we\n\n22\n00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:06.171\nreally got to start\nwith one of the basics.\n\n23\n00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:07.755\nAnd that's what we're going\nto do in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:11.454\nWe're going to take a look at some\nof the different types of malware\n\n25\n00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:12.587\nthat are out there.\n\n26\n00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:17.049\nOnce we establish that, we're really going\nto focus on the virus side cuz there's\n\n27\n00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.545\nplenty of different MOW\nware types out there.\n\n28\n00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.046\nYou could really get lost\nin the sea of jargon.\n\n29\n00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:25.964\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, and we really\ngotta understand what the heck this is so\n\n30\n00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:29.540\nwe know that if the product we're using\nis going to protect us against those\n\n31\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.588\ndifferent threats.\n\n32\n00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:34.057\nSo I guess Wes, the best place, as you\nsaid, to start is start defining some of\n\n33\n00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:37.754\nthis stuff, some of these terms we're\ngonna be using throughout these episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:41.046\nWe say antivirus or anti-malware.\n\n35\n00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.379\nWell, what the heck is a virus?\n\n36\n00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.546\nWhat is malware, and why don't I want it?\n\n37\n00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:45.379\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n38\n00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.837\nWell, think about malware.\n\n39\n00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:52.880\nSo, malware is just any code that causes\nsome undesired output on your system.\n\n40\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.712\nNow I'm not talking about an operating\nsystem that needs patched up.\n\n41\n00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:57.644\nNot that type of malfunction, but\n\n42\n00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:00.508\nsome code that is foreign\nto the operating system,\n\n43\n00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:04.921\nmaybe foreign to a device makes it's way\non the system and different systems.\n\n44\n00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:06.796\nWe're talking about networks.\n\n45\n00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:09.922\nWe're talking about operating\nsystems as far as the clients.\n\n46\n00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:10.959\nWe talk about server,\n\n47\n00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.462\nbut we're really starting out with just\nlooking at the malware in general.\n\n48\n00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:18.950\nJust think about any code out there that\nmakes it's way onto your machine, and\n\n49\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.879\nit causes some unauthorized,\nundesired effect.\n\n50\n00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.919\nNow you might say,\n\n51\n00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.087\nwell I've seen regular applications\nthat you can just cause problems too.\n\n52\n00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:29.212\n>> Yeah,\nI'm thinking of a couple right now, but.\n\n53\n00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:31.327\n[LAUGH]\n>> So when it comes down to it,\n\n54\n00:02:31.327 --> 00:02:34.396\nwe're not so much talking about\nthe applications that you are aware of,\n\n55\n00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:37.615\nwe're talking about some of the things\nthat try to sneak in under the hood and\n\n56\n00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.753\nyou don't even know they're\nthere til too late.\n\n57\n00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:42.961\nSo let's go ahead and dive in and\ntalk about one of the first ones.\n\n58\n00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.253\nSince we're talking about viruses,\nlet's look at what a virus is.\n\n59\n00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:49.375\nSo here on the computer here,\none of the things that we have to\n\n60\n00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:52.987\nknow that establishes of virus from\nthe other forms of malware is, and\n\n61\n00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:55.087\none of the first things is, it is a host.\n\n62\n00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:59.032\nIt can't make its way onto a system\nwithout being able to piggyback whether it\n\n63\n00:02:59.032 --> 00:03:02.916\nbe a file, we'll look at some of the\ndifferent types of ways that can make its\n\n64\n00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.087\nway onto your system.\n\n65\n00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:07.451\nThat's one of the things, Mike,\nthat really establishes a virus from other\n\n66\n00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.088\npieces of malware is that it does need,\nthink about a virus, right, in your body.\n\n67\n00:03:11.088 --> 00:03:12.921\nIt has to attach itself to a cell, right?\n\n68\n00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:15.874\nWhether it's to replicate or\nwhether it makes its way and\n\n69\n00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:17.421\ncorrupts your body, right?\n\n70\n00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:20.463\nWell it's no different than your files and\nthe code that's on your operating systems.\n\n71\n00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:23.682\nWhen it makes its way into your system,\nit starts replicating itself and\n\n72\n00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:26.504\nit starts infecting,\nwould be the host that it's running on.\n\n73\n00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:29.212\n>> So we don't go and download a virus.\n\n74\n00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:33.587\nWe download an infected file, and\nthat file is what contains the virus.\n\n75\n00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:35.296\nSo that file, then,\nis the host that you're talking about.\n\n76\n00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:36.088\n>> That's right.\n\n77\n00:03:36.088 --> 00:03:38.796\nAnd where can we see\nthose different types?\n\n78\n00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:42.129\nWell, there's all different types\nthat we have out there, right?\n\n79\n00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.243\nOne of the common ones that maybe\nsome of you guys are aware of\n\n80\n00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:48.003\nare things like Internet-based attacks,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:50.910\nAnd honestly, I understand that some\nof these can blur the lines and\n\n82\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.004\nthey can fall into the same categories,\nright?\n\n83\n00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:54.462\nCuz we say e-mail.\n\n84\n00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:57.318\nRight, well e-mail you've got\nan attachment to that e-mail and\n\n85\n00:03:57.318 --> 00:04:00.531\nit comes into your system and you don't\nhave certain checks and balances,\n\n86\n00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.962\nInternet gateway, antivirus.\n\n87\n00:04:01.962 --> 00:04:05.087\nYou don't have like a concentrator\non your e-mail systems.\n\n88\n00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:08.087\nWell technically that is\nan Internet-based attack, right?\n\n89\n00:04:08.087 --> 00:04:10.129\nYour emails are sent all\nover across the Internet.\n\n90\n00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.669\nSo I'm being a little bit more generic on\nthis, talking about things like gaming\n\n91\n00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.296\nconsoles, gaming systems,\nthat's one that we find out a lot.\n\n92\n00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:21.953\nSome of you probably like to connect\nto an online gaming platform and\n\n93\n00:04:21.953 --> 00:04:25.171\nyou download all of the coordinates and\nstuff for the game.\n\n94\n00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.945\nWell, what's to say that you really know\nwhat that information is coming from, and\n\n95\n00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:29.913\nif it's not somebody's world\nrogue web server out there.\n\n96\n00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:30.547\nAm I right?\n>> Right.\n\n97\n00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:35.875\nAbsolutely because it's easy to slip\nsome type of file on somebody's\n\n98\n00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:41.129\nmachine like downloading drivers\nfrom the Internet is another way.\n\n99\n00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.087\nA lot of those shareware sites and\nthings like that.\n\n100\n00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:46.296\nThose are good places to get infected.\n\n101\n00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:47.796\n>> For sure, and if you look, I mean,\n\n102\n00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:50.754\nwe're talking about connecting to\na web server just very basically.\n\n103\n00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:52.421\nWe’re connecting to a web server and\n\n104\n00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.962\nif you think about just web\ncommunications in general.\n\n105\n00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:55.879\nWhat are you doing?\n\n106\n00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.565\nWell when you connect to a web server,\nyou;ve got a piece of software on your\n\n107\n00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.871\nbrowser and\nit's actually making a request for\n\n108\n00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:04.712\na file to be delivered once you\nconnect to that web server.\n\n109\n00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:07.540\nThere's nothing really says that if you\nconnect to that web server that they've\n\n110\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.963\ngot to deliver the file that you wanted.\n\n111\n00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:12.047\nWhat's to say that they're not gonna just\ndeliver something that you don't want?\n\n112\n00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:14.879\nNow, we have trust models in place\nto hope that that doesn't happen.\n\n113\n00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.595\n[LAUGH] But that's one of\nthe reasons we have things like, and\n\n114\n00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:20.588\nwe'll talk about it in other episodes,\ncertificates and stuff.\n\n115\n00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:22.826\nSo we verify that we're\nconnecting to a web server, but\n\n116\n00:05:22.826 --> 00:05:25.171\nwhen it comes down to it it\nreally works on a model of trust.\n\n117\n00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:28.337\nYou have to trust the websites that you\ngo to and it's really no different.\n\n118\n00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:29.671\nThink about a file transfer.\n\n119\n00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.618\nIf I connect to someones\nftp site out there and\n\n120\n00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:34.335\nI'm gonna download because it's\na little bit more streamline\n\n121\n00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:37.629\nthen downloading all of the information\nif I just needed a little text file.\n\n122\n00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.450\nWell you might think I optimized file\ntransfer solution I connect to that just\n\n123\n00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.754\ndownloading text files what's the problem?\n\n124\n00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:46.629\nWell think about what a virus is,\nit's nothing more than text.\n\n125\n00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:50.807\nBut it's an executable string of data that\nwhen it makes it's way onto your computer,\n\n126\n00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:51.964\nit can cause problems.\n\n127\n00:05:51.964 --> 00:05:54.962\nSo in the Internet-based ones, notice\nthat there is a consistency in this.\n\n128\n00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:57.068\nDoesn't matter if it's\nan online gaming platform,\n\n129\n00:05:57.068 --> 00:05:59.087\nit's gonna deliver data\nback to my local machine.\n\n130\n00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:01.671\nAnd we just hope that it is\nthe data that we want it to be.\n\n131\n00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.296\nIt's no different if I do\na connection to a web browser.\n\n132\n00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:08.816\nThere's nothing that says that somebody\ncan't intercept that request and\n\n133\n00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:11.087\nredirect it out to a rogue web server.\n\n134\n00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:13.837\nThe other thing happens with\nthings like file transfers, right?\n\n135\n00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:18.462\nFile transfers, I connect to a server,\nI download that driver like Mike said.\n\n136\n00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:22.254\nI haven't verified that\nthe driver is what it says.\n\n137\n00:06:22.254 --> 00:06:26.046\nI don't do my own checks and balances,\nand now I got a virus on my machine.\n\n138\n00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:28.869\nBut one thing that seems to be\nunanimous across the board so\n\n139\n00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.586\nfar is that there has to be\nsome kind of delivery method.\n\n140\n00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:35.254\nIt has to make its way onto your computer.\n\n141\n00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:37.503\nViruses are not self\nsufficient pieces of code.\n\n142\n00:06:37.503 --> 00:06:41.171\nThey can't just go to town and start\nworking without that delivery mechanism.\n\n143\n00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:42.962\nUSB based, right?\n\n144\n00:06:42.962 --> 00:06:44.587\nThat's another common one we think about.\n\n145\n00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.504\nIn fact, I think Mike,\nwe've talked about this many times before.\n\n146\n00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:48.077\nJoking, and\n\n147\n00:06:48.077 --> 00:06:51.837\nit's not really that hilarious, especially\nif it happens to your company, right?\n\n148\n00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:55.467\nWe talk about the attack that says\nlet me go out as an attacker, and\n\n149\n00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:59.955\nif I can make a lot of money against this\nsystem it doesn't really matter to me that\n\n150\n00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:04.129\nmuch that I spent a hundred dollars on\nvery cheap USB thumb drives, right?\n\n151\n00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:07.441\nBuy them out there across seas,\nget them shipped out,\n\n152\n00:07:07.441 --> 00:07:09.962\nput my executable code on that USB stick.\n\n153\n00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:14.004\nWalk into the garage there of your company\nand throw it across the parking lot.\n\n154\n00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:15.255\nWalk away, right?\n\n155\n00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:18.176\nSo Mike, how many of those USB sticks\ndo you think it takes to bring down\n\n156\n00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:18.879\na whole system?\n\n157\n00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.196\n>> Well it only takes one, and\n\n158\n00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:23.586\nI can guarantee you probably nine\nof the 10 are gonna get plugged in.\n\n159\n00:07:23.586 --> 00:07:25.837\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n160\n00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:30.296\nWell I'm guilty about this, so let me tell\nyou something that happened to me, right.\n\n161\n00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:32.837\nSo somebody comes back from one\nof these conventions, right?\n\n162\n00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:34.088\nAnd it wasn't a security convention.\n\n163\n00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:37.212\nIt really doesn't matter, it would be even\nworse if it was a security convention.\n\n164\n00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:38.433\nSo people come back from a convention,\n\n165\n00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:40.211\nthe first thing they do is\nthe give you some swag, right?\n\n166\n00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:40.879\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n167\n00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.922\n>> Well this swag's got a little\nUSB kit that lights up.\n\n168\n00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:45.795\nYou plug it into your computer right and\nhere I am teaching security.\n\n169\n00:07:45.795 --> 00:07:49.671\nRight, here I am tell you guys don't\ndo this and do as I say not as I do.\n\n170\n00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:51.217\nI reach over and look at the little light.\n\n171\n00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:54.297\n[LAUGH] And then all of a sudden I\nsee this little executable pop up and\n\n172\n00:07:54.297 --> 00:07:56.334\nI'm trying to figure out what's going on.\n\n173\n00:07:56.334 --> 00:08:00.396\n>> Uh-huh Well I hope it was benign,\nwell that is what I am hoping.\n\n174\n00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:03.630\nBut it launches a website that takes me\nright out to whatever the product was that\n\n175\n00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.780\nthey're selling.\n\n176\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.470\nThat is one that,\nagain I hope, wasn't malicious.\n\n177\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.230\nBut look how easy it is,\nlike with the USB attack.\n\n178\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.342\nRight you think well, I'm not going\nto walk through the parking lot, and\n\n179\n00:08:14.342 --> 00:08:17.030\ngrab a USB device and\nplug it into my computer.\n\n180\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.430\nWell I can tell you from firsthand\nexample, well what's it different\n\n181\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.360\nto have ten thousand of these little cheap\ndevices made and spread your malware.\n\n182\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.510\nNow people are going back and\n\n183\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.770\nplugging what they thought they just\ngot for free into their devices and\n\n184\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.560\nthey bypassed every single one\nof your layered defense systems.\n\n185\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.870\nAnd even worse now that they've got\naccess to your physical computer.\n\n186\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.310\nAnd one of the things that we talked\nabout, I think Microsoft in fact Mike,\n\n187\n00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.290\nI think it was you that pointed\nthis out to me years ago.\n\n188\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.150\nThis is one of the immutable laws\nof security says that if I can\n\n189\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.710\ntouch your computer it's\nno longer your computer.\n\n190\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.150\nWell you might say well,\nyou didn't touch my computer.\n\n191\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.214\nWell once you take my physical\ndevice that I've put my code on and\n\n192\n00:08:52.214 --> 00:08:53.645\nyou plug it into your system.\n\n193\n00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:54.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've reached out and\n\n194\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.720\nI've touched your computer, and now\npotentially it's no longer your computer.\n\n195\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.040\n>> Absolutely.\n\n196\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.000\nYeah, that's a lot of different methods\nin there, and that's not the only way.\n\n197\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.470\nWe talked about email, what's another\nway we can get viruses in there?\n\n198\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.810\n>> Well that's, yeah,\nI mean good question there.\n\n199\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.750\nSo again, you'll start to see\nsome of these blur the line.\n\n200\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.337\nI did set the stage with email or\nwith Internet based,\n\n201\n00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:15.250\nwell email is another one\nof those Internet based.\n\n202\n00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.550\nBut this is a specific attack.\n\n203\n00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.575\nThis is usually attacking the attachments\nthat come into your emails or\n\n204\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:24.840\nemail servers if you will, and\nthen get distributed out to your clients.\n\n205\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.180\nSo if an attacker can take something\nlike your distribution list,\n\n206\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.400\nif they can get ahold of that address\nbook inside of your mail server,\n\n207\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.470\nwell there's nothing that says\nthey can't turn around and\n\n208\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.020\nsend everyone of the clients\nwith inside of your system,\n\n209\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.190\nsome kind of an attachment that\nhas some executable string.\n\n210\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.957\nNow, for the most part, a lot of the\ntechnologies can stop that in place but\n\n211\n00:09:43.957 --> 00:09:46.010\nthere's never any guarantee.\n\n212\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.179\nYou open an email that's in your spam\nbox and you don't know who it came from,\n\n213\n00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:54.284\nsometimes even if you do know who it\ncomes from, if you don't have the proper\n\n214\n00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:58.069\nchecks and balances in check, and\nthat is an executable attachment,\n\n215\n00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:02.010\nwhen it hits your computer,\nyou've already downloaded it, job done.\n\n216\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.530\nYou know, virus file received.\n\n217\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.775\nAnd it starts to do you know,\n\n218\n00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:12.384\nwhat it does best, infecting systems.\n\n219\n00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:13.630\nWhich also takes me to one of the other\nthings that we have to worry about.\n\n220\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.570\nThink about what a virus does.\n\n221\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.380\nThink about what a flu or any cold does.\n\n222\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.090\nIt spreads itself, right?\n\n223\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.770\nAnd you go, [COUGH] you cough in your\nhand, you shake the next person's hand,\n\n224\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.270\nwell guess what?\n\n225\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.230\nIt just spread to the next person.\n\n226\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.250\nSo if you have already infected machines\non your systems, there's nothing that says\n\n227\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.750\nthat in just a connection,\na communication in the background,\n\n228\n00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.935\neven a network communication, that if\nthe attacker is savvy enough that they can\n\n229\n00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.920\nwrite into the code that says the moment\nyou tack to that, you talk or\n\n230\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.630\ncommunicate with that infected machine it\ntransfers the infection right over to you.\n\n231\n00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.220\nAnd that's one of the things that these\nviruses do, they gotta propagate right?\n\n232\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.226\nThey gotta find a way to spread themselves\nto other devices and one of the main\n\n233\n00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:53.870\nmechanisms we always have to remember\nis that the virus needs a host.\n\n234\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.160\nIt needs a transfer mechanism.\n\n235\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.170\nIt then needs a delivery platform.\n\n236\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.407\nAnd that is something that you\nreally have to watch out for\n\n237\n00:11:01.407 --> 00:11:05.060\nwhen it comes to protecting\nyourself from this type of malware.\n\n238\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.351\n>> All right, Wes,\nwe've got viruses, nasty creatures,\n\n239\n00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:08.906\nlots of different ways we can get them.\n\n240\n00:11:08.906 --> 00:11:12.574\nThey attach themselves to a file\ntypically or something similar.\n\n241\n00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:16.690\nAnd then that file gets transferred\naround and then so does the virus.\n\n242\n00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.590\nThe next category, though,\nis a little more, I don't know if I\n\n243\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.880\nwanna say dangerous, but-\n>> Yeah,\n\n244\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.800\nthis one's a little bit more mischievous,\nif you will.\n\n245\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.460\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's got a lot of mischief in it and\n\n246\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.840\nit's a little bit more invasive.\n\n247\n00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.970\nI don't even wanna say more invasive\nbecause viruses can spread and\n\n248\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.860\nthis other one can spread, too.\n\n249\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.760\nBut now what we're talking about\nis something completely different.\n\n250\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.450\nNow, what we're talking about is the worm.\n\n251\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.200\nAll right?\n\n252\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.920\nThe worm is different than the virus.\n\n253\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.880\nNow, it's going to spread just like\na virus does, but what makes these so\n\n254\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.766\ndangerous?\n\n255\n00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:47.784\nNow, this is a self\nreplicating piece of code.\n\n256\n00:11:47.784 --> 00:11:53.060\nThis code, if it needs to,\ncan sit outside of your access.\n\n257\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.180\nOutside of your network connectivity\ndevices, patiently waiting.\n\n258\n00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.045\nLike the wolf, like the lion if\nyou ever watch the nature channel,\n\n259\n00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:04.130\njust sitting there stalking out\nthere through the high grass, right?\n\n260\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.370\nWell, the worm is no different.\n\n261\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.840\nThe worm doesn't need a file,\nit doesn't need a host,\n\n262\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.680\nit doesn't need a delivery mechanism.\n\n263\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.080\nIts delivery mechanism is an open port.\n\n264\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.013\nA service that maybe you've got turned on\nwith inside of your network that you're\n\n265\n00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:20.817\nnot even using.\n\n266\n00:12:20.817 --> 00:12:24.218\nWe talked about things like Telnet and\nFTP, and for the most part,\n\n267\n00:12:24.218 --> 00:12:28.178\npeople are really familiar with the fact\nthat you need to secure these today.\n\n268\n00:12:28.178 --> 00:12:31.870\nWhat about the person that\ndoesn't do due diligence?\n\n269\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.340\nWell, the worm can sit outside of\nthat connectivity device, waiting for\n\n270\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.530\nthat unused service.\n\n271\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.700\nAnd then when it finds its port of entry,\nit makes its way on to your computer.\n\n272\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.610\nNow what's the deliver mechanism?\n\n273\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.827\nGuys its not really much different\nthan the other delivery mechanisms.\n\n274\n00:12:44.827 --> 00:12:49.455\nWhat really sets this apart from\nthe virus, a piece of nasty malware,\n\n275\n00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:52.290\nis the fact that it's self-sufficient.\n\n276\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.130\nNow the worm's goal is\na little bit more than that.\n\n277\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.510\nThe worms goal is to replicate itself so\nmuch that it consumes resources.\n\n278\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.400\nNow you might say,\nwell what kind of resources?\n\n279\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.880\nWell if we look down here,\n\n280\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.600\nwe've got a few different common resources\nthat it likes to consume, right.\n\n281\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.107\nIt gets onto your hard drive,\nit replicates itself, and it's really just\n\n282\n00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:14.013\nbased on whoever programmed it,\nwhat they really want to do.\n\n283\n00:13:14.013 --> 00:13:18.010\nIt can be collection of information,\nbut more so than anything,\n\n284\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.583\nit's gonna be largely about\nconsuming those resources.\n\n285\n00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:26.018\nMy disk utilization,\nnow I've got filling up that hard drive.\n\n286\n00:13:26.018 --> 00:13:29.387\nEven, I say worst case scenario,\nbest case scenario,\n\n287\n00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:31.545\nyou get a denial of service attack.\n\n288\n00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:33.006\nAll of a sudden I can't print anymore.\n\n289\n00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:34.424\nWell, why can't you print?\n\n290\n00:13:34.424 --> 00:13:38.650\nYou need a certain amount of disk space to\nbe able to print, well if the virus, or\n\n291\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.678\nexcuse me, the worm consumes\nall your hard drive space,\n\n292\n00:13:41.678 --> 00:13:45.927\nnow you can't store information,\nyou can't do your day to day productivity.\n\n293\n00:13:45.927 --> 00:13:48.090\nHow about the memory in\nyour operating system?\n\n294\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.080\nIt is dynamic in the fact that,\nremember when we shut our computer off,\n\n295\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.100\nit's gonna erase everything and\nthat'd be great, but while the computer is\n\n296\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:01.050\non that's how we work with it, it starts\nto consume your memory resources.\n\n297\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.080\nLoading itself into any one of\nthose billions of memory addresses,\n\n298\n00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.950\nuntil eventually you have no more memory,\nand it can lead into a worse attack.\n\n299\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.260\nAttacks that we'll be talking\nabout in other episodes,\n\n300\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.630\nlike for instance buffer overflow attack.\n\n301\n00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.380\nIf i can consume that information and\nspill it over to unchecked memory then\n\n302\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.750\nmaybe I can put executable\ncode in there that can be run.\n\n303\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.580\nBut again, a worm is more about\nconsuming those resources.\n\n304\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.680\nAlso with your network bandwidth too.\n\n305\n00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.292\nWe need network communications.\n\n306\n00:14:27.292 --> 00:14:28.778\nWe need to talk to servers.\n\n307\n00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:32.870\nWe need the clients to reach out to\nthe email server, pull down those emails.\n\n308\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.920\nWe need to save information, maybe\nwe're doing folder redirection, right?\n\n309\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.520\nWell, how can you do all that if you\ncan't communicate with a network?\n\n310\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.500\nAnd this can give denial\nof service attacks,\n\n311\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.720\nwhere it consumes all of your resources,\nshuts your network down and\n\n312\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.510\nbefore you know it, the rest of your\nnetwork can't even communicate.\n\n313\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.390\nSo not just the local host too, that's\none of the things that makes the worm so\n\n314\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.520\nnasty is that it's self sufficient,\n\n315\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.860\nself replicating, until it consumes\neverything on the network.\n\n316\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.290\nAnd no productivity, the networks down,\nand now you have 1000 helpdesk tickets of\n\n317\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.870\npeople, why can't I gain\naccess to my files?\n\n318\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:08.960\n>> It's tricky.\n\n319\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.200\nWe had a work situation where we\nhad to deal with, what one was it,\n\n320\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.520\nwe had SQL slammer.\n\n321\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.922\nYou know it took one machine to be\nvulnerable to that and catch that worm.\n\n322\n00:15:20.922 --> 00:15:22.650\nAnd then as it tries to replicate,\n\n323\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:27.490\nit's generating so much replication\ntraffic that the network was saturated.\n\n324\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.720\nAnd at first,\nyou don't know what machine is infected.\n\n325\n00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.579\nYou can't do anything over\nthe network to try to,\n\n326\n00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:36.520\nI mean it becomes very\ndifficult to try to contain.\n\n327\n00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.721\nSo you start shutting things down and then\nletting them back on one at a time until\n\n328\n00:15:40.721 --> 00:15:45.000\nyou figure out what the heck is going on\nand which one's causing all the trouble.\n\n329\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.846\n>> Yeah.\nIf you think about a situation like that,\n\n330\n00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:49.403\nyou've really gotta be careful\nwith your whole troubleshoot,\n\n331\n00:15:49.403 --> 00:15:50.604\nthe troubleshooting model.\n\n332\n00:15:50.604 --> 00:15:52.934\nCuz if you start trying to,\nmaking all of these fixes and changes, and\n\n333\n00:15:52.934 --> 00:15:53.970\nall of the sudden it goes away.\n\n334\n00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.973\nYou don't know exactly what you've done.\n\n335\n00:15:56.973 --> 00:15:59.783\nAt least remedy the situation,\nmaybe not fix the problem.\n\n336\n00:15:59.783 --> 00:16:02.530\nAnd then, again,\nthe worm's not going to go away.\n\n337\n00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.330\nJust because you quarantined it or\nyou got it off of one system,\n\n338\n00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.880\nit's still replicating.\n\n339\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.520\nAnd it's not stopping.\n\n340\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.385\nAnd in fact you've probably seen,\nyou can go out there in the Internet.\n\n341\n00:16:11.385 --> 00:16:12.065\nYou could look at.\n\n342\n00:16:12.065 --> 00:16:16.372\nMike, I think there's websites out there\nthat'll show you like the prolification,\n\n343\n00:16:16.372 --> 00:16:19.385\nis that the, how long- [CROSSTALK]\nDisperses itself there?\n\n344\n00:16:19.385 --> 00:16:21.900\nI'll make my own contribution\nto the English language here.\n\n345\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.171\n[LAUGH]\n>> I forget the name of the site.\n\n346\n00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:27.928\nCadia or sadia or something, but\nthey've got some really cool animated GIFs\n\n347\n00:16:27.928 --> 00:16:32.316\nthat I'll show you that, in a matter\nof hours, I think it was code red,\n\n348\n00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:36.950\nwas pretty much across the world in\na matter of minutes with like sapphire.\n\n349\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.550\nThey're just amazing.\n\n350\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.230\n>> That's insane.\n\n351\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.260\nWhen you think about your\naverage network communications,\n\n352\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.950\nif we're just talking about over\nthe network, we're talking milliseconds.\n\n353\n00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.028\nYou're talking about fiber optic backbones\nacross the backbone of the Internet that\n\n354\n00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:51.246\nthe delays are down into\nsmall milliseconds.\n\n355\n00:16:51.246 --> 00:16:54.334\nSo it can really, really spread, so\n\n356\n00:16:54.334 --> 00:16:58.831\nworms are the ones that we\ndefinitely have to look at.\n\n357\n00:16:58.831 --> 00:17:01.820\nNow I'm gonna kinda jump around\nhere on you on the next one, Mike.\n\n358\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.817\nCuz I was gonna move into another type,\nbut I think I wanna save that one for\n\n359\n00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:10.477\nlast, because the one that I want to move\ninto, was gonna move into, was the Trojan.\n\n360\n00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:14.130\nBut the problem is that one can actually\nencompass all of these malware types that\n\n361\n00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.729\nwe're going to talk about, so I think I'm\ngoing to save that one right there and\n\n362\n00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:19.625\nI'm going to move onto another one here.\n\n363\n00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:23.890\nAnd that one is the good old botnet.\n\n364\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.320\nAll right, now with the botnet,\nwhat do we got going on here?\n\n365\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.160\nWe've got a whole bunch of stuff and\nhopefully we can clarify it.\n\n366\n00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.270\nWell the botnet is another\npiece of nasty malware.\n\n367\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:40.020\nIt spreads itself across the Internet,\nacross networks, and\n\n368\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.940\nits job, as it spreads, is not so\n\n369\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.340\nmuch that it's trying to infect\na machine like a virus is.\n\n370\n00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.440\nMore that it's trying\nto control the machine.\n\n371\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.540\nWe have botnets, and\nthis piece of malware, it does want\n\n372\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.700\nto spread itself to as many computers\nas whatever the attacker wants.\n\n373\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:07.470\nA lot of times the botnets usually\nlead you into other, larger attacks.\n\n374\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.670\nAnd what we've don't understand sometimes\nis when the botnets get on here,\n\n375\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.700\nwe've got old hacker come lately\nsitting off to the side, right?\n\n376\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.530\nAnd what he's doing is, he or she,\nwhat they're doing is, first of all,\n\n377\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.660\nthey're spreading the botnet.\n\n378\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.360\nSecond of all is,\nnotice the outbound communications.\n\n379\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.120\nOne of the things that the botnets do is\nthey distribute a type of software that\n\n380\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.640\ncan send outbound communications and\nwait for incoming commands.\n\n381\n00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.900\nWell, you might say, well,\nwhy do we want incoming commands?\n\n382\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.780\nWhat kind of commands?\n\n383\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.330\nWell, what you might not realize\nis that when you have this botnet,\n\n384\n00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.950\nyou're just a small pawn\nin a larger game where\n\n385\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.510\nthis hacker or\nattacker is actually controlling,\n\n386\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:55.480\nmaybe you are just one small subset\nof a larger, massive infection.\n\n387\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.960\nAll right, so think about this.\n\n388\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.385\nWhen you wanna attack a system that has\na [LAUGH] lot more bandwidth than you.\n\n389\n00:19:01.385 --> 00:19:03.661\nSo let's think about somebody like Google.\n\n390\n00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:04.986\nMy little laptop here,\n\n391\n00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:09.900\nI can't send enough information to Google\nto bring them offline, if I'm an attacker.\n\n392\n00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.870\nThey're gonna look at my system and\n\n393\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.020\nit's not even gonna make their\nnetwork adapters blip at all.\n\n394\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.680\nBut if I have 10,000 computers.\n\n395\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.510\nIf I have 20,000 computers\nthat the attackers\n\n396\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.020\ndistributed this botnet across it,\nthey're all listening out.\n\n397\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.870\nThey're all listening out for an incoming\ncommand that says simultaneously attack\n\n398\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.660\na destination target.\n\n399\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.830\nNow, collectively,\neveryone in this larger, massive\n\n400\n00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.150\nconsortium of infected machines attack\na single target and bring it offline.\n\n401\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.509\nNow, not saying that you'll\nbring Google offline.\n\n402\n00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:41.112\nBut if you do have a system, and\n\n403\n00:19:41.112 --> 00:19:44.087\nthat's one of the things that\nthese botnets they start.\n\n404\n00:19:44.087 --> 00:19:48.484\nThey're usually a precursor to a larger\nattack against a system that maybe\n\n405\n00:19:48.484 --> 00:19:50.830\nsomebody wants to bring offline.\n\n406\n00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.980\nMaybe they're a hacktivist,\nmaybe they're a social activist and\n\n407\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.150\nthey want to cause some kind of\nchange in the world or whatever.\n\n408\n00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.770\nAnd they bring somebody that\nthey don't like off the network.\n\n409\n00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:05.405\nAgain, if you're connected to a large ISP,\nit's not gonna be so easy but with 10,000,\n\n410\n00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:10.230\n20,000, 30,000 computers,\nnow it becomes a little bit easier, Mike,\n\n411\n00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.110\nand now you have the bandwidth to\ntake one of the bigger guys offline.\n\n412\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.850\n>> Really seems like you're\njust multiplying your attack\n\n413\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.740\npower, in this case.\n\n414\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.770\n>> That's exactly it, yeah.\n\n415\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.800\nYou think about it,\n\n416\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:25.060\nit's like having 10,000 multitaskers all\nlistening out on that conference call.\n\n417\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.931\nAnd when they receive the call,\n\n418\n00:20:26.931 --> 00:20:30.407\nthey all start talking to that\none target simultaneously.\n\n419\n00:20:30.407 --> 00:20:34.075\nAnd now that poor target that they've\nattacked cannot answer to things like\n\n420\n00:20:34.075 --> 00:20:36.197\nresource requests from legitimate users,\n\n421\n00:20:36.197 --> 00:20:39.939\nmaybe authentication requests and\nunfortunately, productivity is lost.\n\n422\n00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:43.870\nAnd we have a large company that can\npotentially make millions of dollars\n\n423\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.802\nan hour and lose millions of dollars\nan hour for the times that they can't\n\n424\n00:20:47.802 --> 00:20:52.090\naccurately reply to their authenticated\nusers and their customers.\n\n425\n00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.725\nThis can be very\ndetrimental to a business.\n\n426\n00:20:53.725 --> 00:20:54.650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And can\n\n427\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.840\nreally bring a business to their\nknees within minutes if not hours.\n\n428\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.090\n>> Absolutely.\n\n429\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.420\nAnother one that we've heard about\nthat's a pretty nasty one I think is\n\n430\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.930\nthe good old rootkit.\n\n431\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.205\n>> Yeah, the rootkit.\n\n432\n00:21:05.205 --> 00:21:09.415\nNow, with the root kit,\nthe root kit is something that the name\n\n433\n00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:12.755\nitself started back when you\npretty much had NIX based system.\n\n434\n00:21:12.755 --> 00:21:17.355\nAnd it gets its name from root user, super\nuser or super root, I guess you would say.\n\n435\n00:21:17.355 --> 00:21:20.425\nThe super user in some of\nthese old NIX based systems.\n\n436\n00:21:20.425 --> 00:21:22.832\nNow, you might say, well,\ngood I don't have NIX.\n\n437\n00:21:22.832 --> 00:21:25.848\nI've got, I don't use Linux,\nI don't use UNIX, I use Windows, so\n\n438\n00:21:25.848 --> 00:21:27.740\nI should be safe, right?\n\n439\n00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.050\nNo.\nThat's not the case.\n\n440\n00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:35.120\nJust because the name got its name\nfrom those earlier operating systems,\n\n441\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.830\nthe concept is the same.\n\n442\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.900\nWhat is the root user?\n\n443\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.710\nWhat does the root kit try to do?\n\n444\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.620\nWell, it tries to slipstream its\nway into the operating system,\n\n445\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.720\nmaybe even below the operating system.\n\n446\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.260\nMaybe down in the deeper\nportions of the curdle, and\n\n447\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.710\nintercept anything that's coming\ndown that you're telling it to do.\n\n448\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.330\nLike for instance,\nif you do an antivirus scan.\n\n449\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.680\nIt's sitting down there in\nthe lower portions of the curdle,\n\n450\n00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.520\nintercepting those calls and\nit just pushes back up to the end user,\n\n451\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.518\nwhatever it wants to see,\nso it says I'm not here.\n\n452\n00:22:01.518 --> 00:22:07.760\nAll right, now, that is a very,\nvery nasty bug to get rid of.\n\n453\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.340\nWe do have technologies out there\nthat can help you like that,\n\n454\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.000\nvery early low boot integrity checks.\n\n455\n00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.870\nWe talk about UEFI, Secure Boot.\n\n456\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.910\nMicrosoft has something\nbuilt in called ELAM,\n\n457\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.460\nthe Early Launch Anti-Malware Drivers.\n\n458\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.530\nWhat they do is they check things like\nsystem drivers before the operating system\n\n459\n00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.070\neven boots.\n\n460\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.230\nAnd we have checks and balances.\n\n461\n00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:33.074\nSo the rootkits, once they're in they\ncan be kinda difficult to get rid of.\n\n462\n00:22:33.074 --> 00:22:37.430\nI'll give you an example of legal,\nnot illegal, but a legal rootkit.\n\n463\n00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.750\nA hypervisor.\n\n464\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.490\nWe talked about virtualization.\n\n465\n00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.860\nWell virtualization is nothing more\nthan a legal form of a rootkit.\n\n466\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.680\nThink about when you've\n\n467\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.980\ngot a virtual machine running\non another operating system.\n\n468\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.670\nAnd that virtual machine says,\nI'm the only one here.\n\n469\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.330\nWell, how does it think\nit's the only one here?\n\n470\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.790\nWell, hypervisor's in there lying to it,\nsaying,\n\n471\n00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.000\nyou're the only device on this machine.\n\n472\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.411\nWell, guess what?\n\n473\n00:22:55.411 --> 00:22:57.112\nYou take that back to a root kit,\n\n474\n00:22:57.112 --> 00:23:00.281\nthe root kit really isn't doing\nmuch different than that.\n\n475\n00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:03.830\nThe root kit is saying, I'm gonna\ntell you whatever you want to see.\n\n476\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.030\nYour anti-virus software?\n\n477\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:05.620\nDon't worry about it.\n\n478\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.380\nI'm gonna tell you that I'm not here.\n\n479\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.885\nAnd because it sits in those lower\nportions of the operating system, and\n\n480\n00:23:10.885 --> 00:23:13.596\nthose abstract layers,\nit causes a big, big problem.\n\n481\n00:23:13.596 --> 00:23:14.642\nIt takes control.\n\n482\n00:23:14.642 --> 00:23:16.930\nBack to that concept of the root user,\nright?\n\n483\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:21.245\nOr even in Windows, you think about the\ndefault user as the administrative user.\n\n484\n00:23:21.245 --> 00:23:24.666\nNow I'm I'm trying to exploit the system\nwith the highest privileged account.\n\n485\n00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:25.224\nAll right.\n\n486\n00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:28.643\nSometimes they can be nasty enough that\nthe commander in chief of the entire\n\n487\n00:23:28.643 --> 00:23:31.310\nsystem unit,\nthe CPU doesn't even know they're there.\n\n488\n00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.358\nSo when you've got the brains of\nthe operations that can't even tell that\n\n489\n00:23:34.358 --> 00:23:36.976\nthe code's there, and\nyou can see why these can be very nasty.\n\n490\n00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:40.886\nAnd it can be one of the ones that are\nthe most difficult to get off, you know,\n\n491\n00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:44.335\nto remove or to quarantine and\nremediate if you will there, Mike.\n\n492\n00:23:44.335 --> 00:23:48.240\n>> And then a class that\nwe're probably familiar with,\n\n493\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.740\neven from our home use spyware.\n\n494\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.260\nAdware, spyware, ransomware.\n\n495\n00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.149\n>> That's right.\n\n496\n00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:54.357\nAnd greyware.\n\n497\n00:23:54.357 --> 00:23:54.868\nThey all.\n\n498\n00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:56.424\nThey blur the lines.\n\n499\n00:23:56.424 --> 00:23:57.097\nRight?\n\n500\n00:23:57.097 --> 00:23:59.512\nWell, let's go ahead.\n\n501\n00:23:59.512 --> 00:24:02.206\nAnd let's check out spyware first.\n\n502\n00:24:02.206 --> 00:24:05.953\nAll right, when we look at spyware,\none of the things that its goal is,\n\n503\n00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:08.190\nis typically to monitor information.\n\n504\n00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.770\nMonitor activities.\n\n505\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.765\nAll right, well you might ask yourself,\n\n506\n00:24:11.765 --> 00:24:14.108\nwell what kind of activities\nare we monitoring?\n\n507\n00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:18.350\nWell it could be really anything that the\nperson that develops the code wants to do.\n\n508\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.870\nIt could be monitoring your local data.\n\n509\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.330\nMonitoring your local hard drive, right?\n\n510\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.120\nMonitoring your browsing habits\nis one of the common ones.\n\n511\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.410\nWe want to know where you're going.\n\n512\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.970\nWe want to gather that information.\n\n513\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:29.880\nWe want to see where you are browsing to.\n\n514\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.166\nAnd we're gonna store that information,\nright?\n\n515\n00:24:34.166 --> 00:24:35.617\nWe can do other things to, like monitor.\n\n516\n00:24:35.617 --> 00:24:36.616\nAnd these are just some of them, guys.\n\n517\n00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:38.830\nI mean, they really can go above and\nbeyond.\n\n518\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.590\nCalculating all your information.\n\n519\n00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.550\nIt could go even farther and be a little\nmore malicious and even go to things like,\n\n520\n00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.120\nfor instance, say a spyware bug\nthat's actually a keylogger, right?\n\n521\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.350\nThat gathers keystrokes and\nsend them, right?\n\n522\n00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.250\nSo, that's one of\nthe things to keep in mind.\n\n523\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.690\nSo, not only monitoring email clients.\n\n524\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.260\nIs the big thing is collecting the data.\n\n525\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.080\nAnd then sending that data outbound.\n\n526\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.690\nNow, when we say sending the data\noutbound, what do we mean by that?\n\n527\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.470\nWho are we sending it to?\n\n528\n00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.270\nWell, that all depends.\n\n529\n00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.300\nFirst of all, you can have a commonality,\nis collection and reselling, right?\n\n530\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:11.840\nCollect your data.\n\n531\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.885\nWe got a collection agency,\nthat's their spyware,\n\n532\n00:25:13.885 --> 00:25:15.390\nthey're gathering the information.\n\n533\n00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.690\nAnd who do they sell it to?\n\n534\n00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.010\nWell, corporations, right?\n\n535\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.680\nCorporations want your information,\nif they can gather that information for\n\n536\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.683\nmarketing campaigns and ad research, and\n\n537\n00:25:24.683 --> 00:25:26.920\nwe're not even talking\nabout adware this way.\n\n538\n00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.324\nAnd they know how to strategically\nplace different information along your\n\n539\n00:25:30.324 --> 00:25:31.140\nbrowsing habit.\n\n540\n00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.570\nNow that they can be more successful,\nto maybe get you to buy something.\n\n541\n00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.110\nOr how about good old identity thieves,\nright?\n\n542\n00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.840\nIt could be even more malicious than that,\nright?\n\n543\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.430\nWe could have somebody out there that's\ntrying to scrape our information.\n\n544\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.010\nThey're collecting it inbound, and they're\nseeing how they can profile, right?\n\n545\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.710\nNot so much social engineering, but\nthey can see how they can profile.\n\n546\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.590\nThey see that, hey,\nyou're using the Google browser.\n\n547\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.140\nOr Chrome, you're using Safari.\n\n548\n00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.470\nWhatever you're using.\n\n549\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.270\nAnd now we can maybe use that information.\n\n550\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.582\nYou capture information and you use it for\nconnecting to your bank account and\n\n551\n00:26:02.582 --> 00:26:04.250\ndraining your bank account.\n\n552\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:09.238\nSo with the spyware there, it is\nmalicious in the fact that most often\n\n553\n00:26:09.238 --> 00:26:14.140\nit's gonna track your habits and\ntrack your activities and stuff.\n\n554\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.372\nAnd, typically, not only collecting,\n\n555\n00:26:16.372 --> 00:26:19.320\nit also sends it outbound\nto like external locations.\n\n556\n00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.820\n>> Well, yeah nasty stuff.\n\n557\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.150\nAnd Wes, I know we've got more to go over,\n\n558\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:28.430\nbut looking at the clock we're about out\nof time for this particular episode.\n\n559\n00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.310\n>> All right.\n>> So we're gonna have\n\n560\n00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.166\nto wrap things up here, but\nwe've got more about antivirus and\n\n561\n00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:34.000\nanti-malware coming your way,\nso stay tuned.\n\n562\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.810\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n563\n00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.790\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n564\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.508\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:26:38.508 --> 00:26:43.180\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.560\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.267\ntoday we're gonna be continuing\nour discussion in anti-malware and\n\n5\n00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:25.881\nanti-virus and specifically, we're kinda\nbreaking down some of the terminology.\n\n6\n00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.962\nAll of the different types of\nmalware that we have to deal with.\n\n7\n00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:29.671\nAnd with me,\n\n8\n00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:34.131\nto help me get through all these different\ntypes is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:35.060\nHow's it going, Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.870\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going good.\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.530\nIt's good to be here and great to be\nback continuing on our discussion,\n\n12\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.020\ntalking about, well,\nsome of the malware types, right?\n\n13\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.670\nJust like Mike said.\n\n14\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.740\nAnd what are the things we want to go\ninto, we've established what a virus is,\n\n15\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.080\nand how it differs from\nthings like a worm.\n\n16\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.870\nWe talked about a route kit, right?\n\n17\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.880\nAnd exploiting the system\nat the lowest levels,\n\n18\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.320\ntrying to get that privileged access.\n\n19\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.520\nWe've talked about things like botnets and\nwhy you have to worry about them.\n\n20\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.350\nOne of the last things that we\nleft off with in the last episode.\n\n21\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.420\nIf you haven't seen these,\ngo back and check them out.\n\n22\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450\nWas something known as Spyware.\n\n23\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.460\nWell, there's a lot of other\nwares out there if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.440\nWe have, the next one we need to talk\nabout is something known as Adware.\n\n25\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.770\nSo, when we look here at Adware,\n\n26\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.140\none of the things that separates it\nfrom Spyware is usually the purpose.\n\n27\n00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.830\nIt's really going to affect your\nsystems a lot the same spyware does.\n\n28\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.520\nIt's really no different.\n\n29\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.410\nA lot of times it's done\nthrough web browsing, right?\n\n30\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.290\nYou connect to a web browser out there,\nyou launch a web browser, I should say,\n\n31\n00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.180\nconnect to a website out there,\n\n32\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.280\nand then all of a sudden you've got\nsome of these happenings going on.\n\n33\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.060\nWell, what is happening on your computer?\n\n34\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.140\nWell, one of the big things is, when you\nstart your normal web browsing process,\n\n35\n00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.720\nyou might not notice\nanything to begin with.\n\n36\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.890\nBut, however, as time goes on,\nwhen you start to browse again we start\n\n37\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.540\nto see some things that are just a little\nbit different then they were before.\n\n38\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.060\nI love music, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.620\nA lot of times you'll find\nme at a music website,\n\n40\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.550\nwhere they're selling maybe\nguitar pieces for cheap, right?\n\n41\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.042\nWell, what if that's all I'm browsing?\n\n42\n00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:17.060\nI'm browsing a music center out\nthere online to buy my next latest,\n\n43\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.280\ngreatest component on my guitar.\n\n44\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.795\nAnd all of a sudden, I see 50% off of\nthis, 50% off of that, a sale here, and\n\n45\n00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:24.594\na sale there.\n\n46\n00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.414\nAll of a sudden I start getting\nall of these different pop-ups.\n\n47\n00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:30.541\nWell, for the most part, the web\nbrowsers today have done a good job.\n\n48\n00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:33.995\nAnd it doesn't matter which web browser\nyou're talking about, even if you're\n\n49\n00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:38.820\ntalking about Internet Explorer, if you're\ntalking about Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.\n\n50\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.830\nThey do a good job blocking\nthe traditional popup, right?\n\n51\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.170\nSo what differentiates a piece of\nadware from the traditional popup?\n\n52\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.590\nWell, the adware is an infection\non the system, all right?\n\n53\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.080\nA lot of times the adware gets on\nyour system, these little bugs here.\n\n54\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.120\nAnd as you start to browse out\nthere to the internet, whoever's\n\n55\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.830\ncoded that little bug on your system\ndisplays the pop ups that they want.\n\n56\n00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.970\nThe pop ups that maybe can go a little\nbit more malicious than this and\n\n57\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.610\nredirect you to their website.\n\n58\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.060\nAnd when that happens,\nit becomes a very, very bad annoyance.\n\n59\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.640\nSo Mike, I would say with this one,\n\n60\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.060\nyes, they can be as devious as\nredirecting you out to their websites.\n\n61\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.980\nBut a lot of times this is more\nof what I would I call, not so\n\n62\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.440\nmuch adware, which is the technical\nname for it, but annoying ware.\n\n63\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, adware might not be as obviously\ndestructive as viruses and worms.\n\n64\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.840\nBut when it comes to employee loss and\nproductivity, over 100s or\n\n65\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.785\n1000s of employees,\nbusinesses don't like this adware either.\n\n66\n00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:44.900\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; Yeah, that's one of the reasons I\nreally call it annoying ware because when\n\n67\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.820\nyou put it like that, when you multiply\nall the machines within your network,\n\n68\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.270\nit can bring a corporation\nto it's knees very easily.\n\n69\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.450\nJust having a fight closing all those\nbrowsers down or the extra popups.\n\n70\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.590\nWhich is one of the good things.\n\n71\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.000\nI'm glad that we don't have to go to a lot\nof the extra third party pop ups anymore.\n\n72\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.160\nThat they've got them built in.\n\n73\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.810\nSo for the most part your web browsers\ndo a good job of blocking this.\n\n74\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.150\nIt's when they don't block these,\nwhen you start to see these annoyances,\n\n75\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.770\nthat you really have to look in to one\nof your malware security software and\n\n76\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.140\nsee that you can't remedy the situation.\n\n77\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.260\nNow another one of those wares that\nwe talk about is, and I'm kind of,\n\n78\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.080\nI have to be honest with you guys,\nI'm gonna kind of lump\n\n79\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.840\nthese into one category and\nthat's something known as ransom ware.\n\n80\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.020\nNow ransom ware is typically something\nthat locks your computer up.\n\n81\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.950\nAnd doesn't allow other actions until you,\nmaybe the only action it allows is\n\n82\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.350\nan outbound communication\nto a rogue web server.\n\n83\n00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.080\nSo you guys might see that some of\nthese kind of blur the lines together.\n\n84\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.630\nSo for instance,\nif I say any malware scan.\n\n85\n00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.990\nThat's one of the common ransom ware\ntype of utilities or malware forms,\n\n86\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.780\nif you will, because it masquerade as it\nis a legitimate antivirus software, right.\n\n87\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.010\nAnd then it scans your computer and it\nsays well we found 400 gazillion viruses\n\n88\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.700\nand if you pay us, we'll be happy to\ntake those viruses off of your machines.\n\n89\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.970\nNow Mike, I've actually seen one for\n\n90\n00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.460\na company I used to work with that\nspoofed the whole entire AV suite,\n\n91\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.510\nbut the one that really got me is that it\nspoofed Microsoft Security Essentials.\n\n92\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.050\nNow you guys might not\nunderstand the joke of that,\n\n93\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.110\nis that Microsoft Security Essentials\nis free.\n\n94\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.470\nIt should never cost you, right?\n\n95\n00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.130\nSo that would've been one of the tell-tale\nsigns if somebody was in the know.\n\n96\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.700\nThe problem with this one is that it\nlocked down all legitimate executables.\n\n97\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.915\nSo that's why I put the rogue\nantivirus sometimes in the ransom ware\n\n98\n00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:45.120\nbecause ransom ware technically\nlocks your computer down and\n\n99\n00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.020\nwants you to pay some kind of\nfee to unlock the computer.\n\n100\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.960\nWell in this case,\n\n101\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.800\nthis rogue antivirus software crossed\nthe line, blurring into both.\n\n102\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.760\nNot only did it masquerade as being\na legitimate piece of antivirus\n\n103\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.680\nsoftware when it was actually\nthe virus that was doing, or\n\n104\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.710\nthe malware, that was doing the infection.\n\n105\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.720\nEven worse than that,\nis it locked down all executables.\n\n106\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.620\nSo Mike, when I was trying to launch\ntask manager to find the process.\n\n107\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't.\n\n108\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.060\nIt would close it down and\nsay it's not allowed.\n\n109\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.750\nSo what would it allow?\n\n110\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.250\nIt would allow Internet Explorer\nto connect outbound.\n\n111\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.840\nAnd that's also where this one kinda\nblurred the line into the third\n\n112\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.860\ncategory, right.\n\n113\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.380\nBrowser Hijacks.\n\n114\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.320\nBrowser hijacks,\nif you guys have ever got this warning\n\n115\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.110\nthat locks up your browser, and it puts an\nannoying ad right there in the middle and\n\n116\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.980\nmaybe some loud alarm, and it doesn't turn\noff until you close your browser down,\n\n117\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.860\nthat's a form of ransom ware, too.\n\n118\n00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.410\nYou get that 1-800 number that's\nfrom a third-world country that says\n\n119\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.400\ncall this number and\nyou could remedy that.\n\n120\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.150\nWell, again, that's another one\nthat locks down the machine.\n\n121\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.050\nSo in that specific piece of antivirus,\nrogue antivirus,\n\n122\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.578\nman it really blurred\nthe line across all three.\n\n123\n00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:57.502\nNow one of the last ones I want to\nmention is the FBI Warning, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:00.279\n[LAUGH] Many people have\nprobably seen the FBI Warning.\n\n125\n00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.940\nAnd again,\nthis is technically a browser hijacking.\n\n126\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.530\nRight?\nIt's really no different.\n\n127\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.480\nI just call that one out,\n\n128\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.180\nbecause that's something that\nsomebody can identify, right?\n\n129\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.230\nIf I say browser hijack, maybe some\npeople don't understand what that is.\n\n130\n00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.340\nBut I would bet that a lot of people have\nheard, or some people have probably heard,\n\n131\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.060\nmore prevalent,\nthe FBI warning than the other ones.\n\n132\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.730\nUltimately, what it comes down to,\nis they are gonna lock up the system.\n\n133\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.580\nAll right and\nwhat are you going to be allowed to do?\n\n134\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.580\nYou're going to be able to connect\noutbound to one malicious website where\n\n135\n00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.200\nthe web,\nthe person that's owns that web server or\n\n136\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.690\nis controlling that web server\nstealing your financial information.\n\n137\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.060\nTypically, for\nsome kind of financial gain here.\n\n138\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.850\nAnd speaking of that,\nany rogue anywhere software.\n\n139\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.910\nThe only thing that it would\nallow is iexplore.exe to run so\n\n140\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.740\nit was telling me you're not gonna\ndo anything on your computer except\n\n141\n00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.840\ntalk to our web server where you can\ncasually put in your banking information.\n\n142\n00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.320\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely I've seen both of those Wes,\n\n143\n00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.140\nwhere somebody thought they had a the\nscanner comes up and it says hey you've\n\n144\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.380\ngot a virus on your machine but if you\npay us we will take care of it for you.\n\n145\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.690\nAnd of course they pop their credit card\nin there and nothing happens, right?\n\n146\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.880\nAfter I explain to them, well,\nyou weren't really buying an anti-virus.\n\n147\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.690\nYou were buying a video game for\nsome kid somewhere.\n\n148\n00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.140\nYou still got to deal with\nwhat's on your computer and\n\n149\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.120\nI've known people with that FBI virus,\nand it looks official.\n\n150\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.420\nTheir computers lock down.\n\n151\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.260\nThey can't do anything.\n\n152\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.200\nIt tells them to, Send some kind of\nmoney order to a destination and\n\n153\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.140\nit'll fix their computer.\n\n154\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.010\nAnd problem is they will do,\nthey'll send the money order and\n\n155\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.520\nof course their computer\ndoesn't get fixed.\n\n156\n00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.940\nAnd they're out the money.\n\n157\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.730\nSo it's really dangerous stuff.\n\n158\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.410\n&gt;&gt; So one of the last ones I want\nto talk about is the Trojan horse.\n\n159\n00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.120\nNow the Trojan Horse is one that\nis actually a delivery mechanism.\n\n160\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.240\nAnd the reason I kept it last is because\nwe really need to establish all the other\n\n161\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.410\nvirus types, or malware, and I keep saying\nthat, we've gotta be technical on this.\n\n162\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.090\nIt's Malware.\n\n163\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.340\nVirus is under that umbrella term.\n\n164\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.520\nSo when you understand\nthe other malware formats,\n\n165\n00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.000\nyou'll understand what\nthis guy here is doing\n\n166\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.090\nthe Trojan horse has a delivery mechanism\nthat looks like it's benign, right?\n\n167\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.010\nYou get that glitter graphic\nthat you click on, right,\n\n168\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.730\nyou get that card that says it's from\nyour grandma across the country, right?\n\n169\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.960\nAnd it looks relatively simple.\n\n170\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.560\nIt could be an application that you're\ndownloading from an unknown source.\n\n171\n00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.560\nRight, the application looks like hey,\nwell it should be fine, right?\n\n172\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.110\nIt's a free calculator.\n\n173\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.670\nWe've got one built in, but\nwhy not download another one, right?\n\n174\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.910\nMakes sense.\n&gt;&gt; It's prettier.\n\n175\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.410\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n176\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.686\n&gt;&gt; It's got bigger buttons, or something.\n\n177\n00:09:29.686 --> 00:09:34.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, when you download it,\nnow all of a sudden, right,\n\n178\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.430\nand notice the delivery mechanism here,\nbefore we move too far on this.\n\n179\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.280\nIt's no different from any\nother piece of malware, right?\n\n180\n00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.180\nEmail, file transfer, web browsing,\nright, network communications.\n\n181\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.970\nIt's no different.\n\n182\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.380\nBut one of the things that kind of,\nyou gotta understand,\n\n183\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.480\nis that it's really just\na delivery mechanism, right?\n\n184\n00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.410\nIt looks like it is\na benign piece of software.\n\n185\n00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.250\nIt's supposed to be something that we\nwant, but in reality, it downloads, and\n\n186\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.520\nit makes it easier for\n\n187\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.850\nall of these potential other pieces\nof malware that we've talked about.\n\n188\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.700\nTo start performing their actions right?\n\n189\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.910\nCould be a Logic Bomb right?\n\n190\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.830\nAnd that's one of the things that we also\nhave to talk about is the Logic Bomb.\n\n191\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.380\nNow that is one,\nwhen we talk about a Logic Bomb,\n\n192\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.820\nLogic Bombs are ones that wait for\ntrigger events, all right.\n\n193\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.870\nTrigger events if you will are things like\nopening a file, opening a program right?\n\n194\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.740\nWell, what is a Logic Bomb?\n\n195\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.680\nA Logic Bomb is a piece of software that\ngets on your computer and stays dormant.\n\n196\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.320\nA lot of times it doesn't\nexecute right away so\n\n197\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.560\nyou don't even know that it's there.\n\n198\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.450\nWell, the reason I wanted to mention that\nin the same concept of trojan horse.\n\n199\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.510\nTrojan horse looks like it's been on.\n\n200\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:45.160\nAnd a lot of times the purpose of\nthe logic bomb is to stay dormant and\n\n201\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.230\nwait for an execution command.\n\n202\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.080\nAnd what's the execution command?\n\n203\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.830\nIt could be a date.\n\n204\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.110\nCertain date happens,\ncertain time happens.\n\n205\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.680\nDon't execute until somebody\nopens their web browser.\n\n206\n00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.490\nNow that we've got an established\ncommunication to a web browser outbound to\n\n207\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.040\na server, execute.\n\n208\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.990\nAlright, so the Logic Bomb also\na lot of times will work hand in\n\n209\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.990\nhand with a trojan horse.\n\n210\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:07.300\nTrojan horse, itself, usually paves\nthe way for other attacks to come along.\n\n211\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.280\nSo lots of different\nmalware types out there,\n\n212\n00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.440\nmalware that we have to be aware of,\nand it can get a little confusing.\n\n213\n00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.310\nIt really can get a little scary.\n\n214\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.120\nBut, as we'll move along in these\nepisodes, we'll show you how to secure,\n\n215\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.830\nwhether it be the client side or\n\n216\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.960\nwhether it be maybe more of\nan enterprise level business.\n\n217\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.040\nSo keep in mind those malware types,\nbe aware of them.\n\n218\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.530\nIf you're not aware of what\nwe've already established,\n\n219\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.180\ngo back and watch those other shows there,\nbecause you really need\n\n220\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.670\nto know the attacks that are happening so\nthat you'll be more prepared.\n\n221\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.280\nIn order to protect yourself from them.\n\n222\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.570\nSo lots of attacks that we have to\ndeal with, lots of types of attacks.\n\n223\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.370\nWhat happens to our system\nwhen we get attacked?\n\n224\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.410\n&gt;&gt; Well one of the things\nthat we can have.\n\n225\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:52.060\nA lot of times the symptoms\ndon't manifest themselves right.\n\n226\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.310\nCompletely, if you will.\n\n227\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.620\nSometimes it's a slow progression.\n\n228\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.630\nOne of the things that I\nkinda want to talk about,\n\n229\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.780\nyou know we mentioned a virus, all right.\n\n230\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.240\nWell with the viruses there are different\ntypes of viruses that we need\n\n231\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.910\nto worry about.\n\n232\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.080\nAll right, when it comes to viruses, yeah,\nwe've said virus just generically but\n\n233\n00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.100\nthe problem is there's so\nmany different types of viruses.\n\n234\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.130\nKeep in mind that like we've established,\nit's a host.\n\n235\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.860\nOnce it has a host,\nnow what is the end result of the virus.\n\n236\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.340\nThat's really what a lot of times what,\n\n237\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.650\nDifferentiates the different\ntypes of iris.\n\n238\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.130\nIt's also, it's always a piece of code\nthat tries to infect your system and\n\n239\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.920\ncause some kind of adverse\nunauthorized effect.\n\n240\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.900\nBut you have things like\nbootloader viruses, right?\n\n241\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.940\nWhen we talk about a bootloader virus,\n\n242\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.260\nits primary concern is putting\nitself inside the boot sector,\n\n243\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.420\nthe boot partitions, right,\nof your hard drives, so that it executes.\n\n244\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.200\nWell, why would you want\na bootloader virus to execute prior\n\n245\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.080\nto the operating system?\n\n246\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.270\nA lot of times they're effective\nbecause the anti malware software\n\n247\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.140\nhasn't even come on line.\n\n248\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.370\nSo the boot loader virus\nis a very succesful one.\n\n249\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.730\nJust like rootkits try to\ninstall themselves and\n\n250\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.420\nthey start to execute before\nthe antivirus software comes online.\n\n251\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.550\nSo you've really got to worry about them.\n\n252\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.990\nThe other ones that we have\nare some of the most common one,\n\n253\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.020\nthe destructive virus.\n\n254\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.820\nThe one that does file deletion,\nit does file corruption,\n\n255\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.140\nstarts corrupting your data,\nstarts erasing your hard drive.\n\n256\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.010\nNow your data's gone and\n\n257\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.750\nyou've gotta perform some type\nof disc recovery option on it.\n\n258\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.710\nThat's another common\none that's out there.\n\n259\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.570\nSome viruses are called macroviruses.\n\n260\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.030\nWell, what's a macro virus?\n\n261\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.860\nWell, you have some different\nprograms out there.\n\n262\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.400\nI think the Office Suite is one of\nthem where they have a subset of\n\n263\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.590\ninstructions that execute in a batch.\n\n264\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.560\nNot so much a batch file, but\nexecute inside of an application.\n\n265\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.390\nWell, if you get a virus\nthat knows those macros and\n\n266\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.960\nknows how to exploit those macros.\n\n267\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.470\nThen when that application comes online,\nthat virus can attack the program.\n\n268\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.960\nSee one of the things\nthat is becoming more and\n\n269\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.220\nmore difficult, and\nnot completely unrealistic,\n\n270\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.610\nbut more difficult is the fact that the\noperating systems are getting more secure.\n\n271\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.670\nSo what does the attacker have to do?\n\n272\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.630\nThey attack the application\nthat run on the software.\n\n273\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.820\nBecause there's always bugs\nsomewhere in the software.\n\n274\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.220\nSo the macro virus is another one\nthat we have to keep in mind.\n\n275\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.735\nNow this other one is what I call\nthe wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n276\n00:14:04.735 --> 00:14:05.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n277\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.100\nand that's the polymorphic virus.\n\n278\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.000\nWhen we look at the polymorphic virus,\nit's one that doesn't necessarily change\n\n279\n00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.150\nits functionality as it\ndoes changing its code.\n\n280\n00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.440\nAll right, it can do things like writing\nitself to a temporary file, right.\n\n281\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.620\nModify its code, write itself back\nto the file and now it's gonna.\n\n282\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.000\nSkirted around your anti-virus software.\n\n283\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.750\nSo again the code kind of changes.\n\n284\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.230\nAnd as we go on we'll talk about\nthings like how that how that kind of\n\n285\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.760\ngets around things like signature\nbased definition when you're\n\n286\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.520\ndoing signature based scanning.\n\n287\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.010\nIf I know what the virus looks like.\n\n288\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.040\nI have a definition.\n\n289\n00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.000\nI have this hash value here.\n\n290\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.150\nBut if one jot changes, one punctuation\nmark changes in that virus right,\n\n291\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.350\nthe hash values no longer match.\n\n292\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:49.510\nSo imaging being able to put a piece of\ncode in there that says rewrite this.\n\n293\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.620\nWrite to a temporary file, delete\nthe original file and write yourself back.\n\n294\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.840\nNow you look different.\n\n295\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.820\nSo now our signatures don't\nmatch anymore and like I said,\n\n296\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.750\nthe wolf with the sheep's clothing on\nnobody can tell that it's a virus,\n\n297\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.510\nso the polymorphic virus is one that\nkind of mutates as it goes along.\n\n298\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.290\nIt changes it's semantics and\nit makes it a little bit harder.\n\n299\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.400\nNow going back to what you had asked Mike,\nwhat are the symptoms that we can see?\n\n300\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.550\nWell one of the things that we can see\nright away in the background I have on my\n\n301\n00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.790\nmachine here Notice this, let me pull\nthis to where you guys can see that.\n\n302\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:25.250\nNotice that I got some disc\nactivity going on right here,\n\n303\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.540\nnotice I got some network\nactivity going on, that is one\n\n304\n00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.240\nof the things that is a tall tale sign\nthat if this is not normal activity.\n\n305\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.110\nWhat's going on here, if I see my cpu\nutilization just spike through the roof\n\n306\n00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.060\nand it stays there at 100% There's\nonly a couple of computers,\n\n307\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.150\nor a couple of programs that I've\never had that have done that.\n\n308\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.240\nAnd I didn't really want them to do that,\nbut they were legitimate software,\n\n309\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.000\nencoding video, encoding and stuff.\n\n310\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.750\nThat's something you expect to see.\n\n311\n00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.400\nSo if you're running\na video encoding software,\n\n312\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.160\nand you see your CPU is pegged at 100% and\nstays there for\n\n313\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.710\nthe whole entire time you're encoding the\nvideo, it's something you expect to see.\n\n314\n00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.090\nBut what if you log into your computer,\nand\n\n315\n00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.440\nyou're not running that\nvideo encoding software?\n\n316\n00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.500\nThe CPU is still packed.\n\n317\n00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.020\nOr like you see here,\nwe've got disk activity.\n\n318\n00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.390\nOr we've got the network activity,\nall right?\n\n319\n00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.670\nNetwork activity has spiked here.\n\n320\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.690\nNow I might notice that maybe\nI'm part of a bot net, right?\n\n321\n00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.920\nMaybe I'm sending outbound communications.\n\n322\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.380\nMaybe it's in the middle of an attack.\n\n323\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.180\nRemember we said, in other episodes,\nattack everybody simultaneously.\n\n324\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.830\nSo if I get the fact that\nthat network adaptor is just.\n\n325\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.780\nSpiked in its utilization.\n\n326\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.870\nWell maybe I want to go\nrun like Wireshark or\n\n327\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.660\nPacket Analyzer to find out\nwhere this information is going.\n\n328\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.700\nSo one of the common things that you can\nsee is things that are against trend.\n\n329\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.620\nPerformance trends change right.\n\n330\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.840\nVery sluggish.\n\n331\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.340\nPerforming poorly.\n\n332\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.530\nYou try to open a program and\nYou swear you're back on the dial up days,\n\n333\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.400\nwhere you had to wait a half hour for\na web page to load, right?\n\n334\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.110\nWell same thing loading that program\nwhen it just takes forever, and\n\n335\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.160\nit takes forever to render\nthe application itself.\n\n336\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.370\nOr maybe it doesn't even load at all.\n\n337\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.220\nMaybe you're missing files.\n\n338\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.580\nMaybe you reboot your hard drive.\n\n339\n00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.820\nYou reboot your operating system,\nmore appropriately there.\n\n340\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.790\nAnd all of a sudden it blue screens\nif you're in Windows environment.\n\n341\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.090\nIf you're in other operating systems,\nit's just kernel panic.\n\n342\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.360\nIt crashes the computer.\n\n343\n00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.870\nThese are some of the common symptoms that\nlet you know that maybe it's time to step\n\n344\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.060\nback and it's time to run an antivirus\nscan and find out what's going on.\n\n345\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.140\nMaybe we want to do something.\n\n346\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.280\nNotice this is resource monitor.\n\n347\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.690\nMaybe I want to do something\nlike task manager.\n\n348\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.160\nAnd I wanna find out a process that's\nrunning in the background, right?\n\n349\n00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.710\nAnd I can find a process that's\nrunning in the background and\n\n350\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.750\nif I separate it, right?\n\n351\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.570\nAnd in fact perform its monitor,\n\n352\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.910\nthat's not a virus that's\nrunning right next to here.\n\n353\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.980\nBut I see the one that's consuming the\nmost resources, so there are ways to find\n\n354\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.260\nthis out, but one of the telltale signs\nis nothing is working the way it seems.\n\n355\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.610\nAnd a lot of the utilization\non your resources just spike.\n\n356\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.490\nSo that's some of the things\nthat you can think of,\n\n357\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.250\nin fact you can see the network right\nthere just instantly spiked back up.\n\n358\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.700\nSo this might be a time that\nmaybe I want to step back.\n\n359\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.690\nFirst of all,\nI want to run an antivirus scan.\n\n360\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.160\nBut keep in mind, if you run your\nantivirus scan that's gonna be just\n\n361\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.620\nsymptoms that you're trying to solve.\n\n362\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.810\nIt's not really an answer to the problem\nbecause you gotta figure out\n\n363\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.460\nhow that got there in the first place.\n\n364\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.410\nAll you're doing is remediating.\n\n365\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.400\nThat's more reactive I think.\n\n366\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.190\nYou want to take a proactive approach.\n\n367\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.510\nAnd if you're aware of the common malware\ntypes, if you're aware of the virus,\n\n368\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.900\nthe delivery mechanisms,\n\n369\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.100\nyou can be a little bit more\nefficient in remedying those systems.\n\n370\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.900\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, I'll tell you what.\n\n371\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.520\nIt's a lot of great information.\n\n372\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.520\nA lot of different types of\nmalware that are out there and,\n\n373\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.730\nI almost did the thing, you know.\n\n374\n00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.990\nWe all tend to use the word\nantivirus to mean everything.\n\n375\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.820\nBut now we know that\nit's really anti malware,\n\n376\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.360\nvirus just being a category of malware.\n\n377\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.040\nAnd there's lots of malware\nthat we've got to deal with.\n\n378\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.390\nAnd now we've got some of that basic\nterminology down so hopefully we'll be\n\n379\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.410\nable to look at some of these solutions\nthat we can use to keep ourselves safe.\n\n380\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.750\nFrom all this malware out there.\n\n381\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.210\nSo great information Wes.\n\n382\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.630\nAnything you want to add before\nwe part ways with our viewers?\n\n383\n00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.170\n&gt;&gt; No.\nJust when it comes to security, Mike,\n\n384\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.990\nis one of the big things I would say\nis don't be reactive be proactive.\n\n385\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.550\nAll right.\n\n386\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.030\nReactive is waiting until you see\na situation like I've seen here\n\n387\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.690\nwith the resource utilization.\n\n388\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.730\nBe proactive.\n\n389\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.310\nHave antivirus scans, have antimalware.\n\n390\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.340\nIf you can't afford it, well that's okay.\n\n391\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.260\nWe all work on a working man's salary and\nthat's understandable.\n\n392\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.580\nThere's a lot of consumer grade software\nout there that you don't have to pay for.\n\n393\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.750\nAnd it can lock your systems down.\n\n394\n00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.840\nBut I would say that's the big thing.\n\n395\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.710\nNo reactive security implementations.\n\n396\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.890\nLet's be proactive, let's make\nsure that our systems stay clean.\n\n397\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:22.700\nLet's get these viruses.\n\n398\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.890\nIf they happen, it's human nature, it's\ngonna happen, let's get them quarantined,\n\n399\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.590\nremediate the systems, and\nwe all have a good day at the office.\n\n400\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.120\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n401\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.290\nAll right.\nWell ladies and\n\n402\n00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.810\ngentleman, we hope you enjoyed watching\nthis one, I know we enjoyed filming it.\n\n403\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.890\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n404\n00:19:35.890

--> 00:00:19.702\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're going to be taking a look at\n\n4\n00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:24.040\nanti-virus and to malware, and\nspecifically, anti-virus software.\n\n5\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.420\nAnd how it works,\nhow it keeps our machines safe.\n\n6\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.690\nI mean how the heck does it even\nknow that there's something\n\n7\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.600\nbad on my computer that\nI need protection from.\n\n8\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.760\nAnd who better to help us with all this\nthen Mr. Wes Bryan, how's it going Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.590\n>> Matt it's going good,\nit's good to be here today,\n\n10\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.790\ngot some good information on tap for\nyou guys out there, and\n\n11\n00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.220\nif you haven't checked out our first\nepisode as we kicked off this series,\n\n12\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.280\nwe defined some of the malware types and\n>> The more umbrella term.\n\n13\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.960\nAnd you're gonna hear us talking about\nanti-virus this, anti-virus that.\n\n14\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.541\nWell the good thing is when we say\nanti-virus it isn't just looking for\n\n15\n00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:00.310\nviruses alone, it's also looking for\nall of the other pieces of malware.\n\n16\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.720\nSo it is all encompassing there Mike.\n\n17\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.862\n>> My goodness I thought I was gonna\nhave to buy like 18 different pieces of\n\n18\n00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:08.380\nsoftware, one for viruses, one for\nworms, one for Trojans, one for botnets.\n\n19\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.432\n>> But\nyou're telling me that's not the case,\n\n20\n00:01:10.432 --> 00:01:12.980\nanti-virus kinda means it's\ngonna find most of that.\n\n21\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.999\n>> That's right when you\ngo to the doctor and\n\n22\n00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:18.172\nhe or she gives you some kind of\nprescription then what do they do,\n\n23\n00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:22.270\nthey always give you another prescription\nfrom another medicine to counter this and\n\n24\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.310\nbefore you know it, you're walking out\nwith a whole bag of prescriptions there.\n\n25\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.761\nSo we don't have to worry about that\ntoday but what we do have to look at.\n\n26\n00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.097\nIs antivirus itself,\nit's all-encompassing, and\n\n27\n00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:37.808\nwe're gonna look over the next couple\nof episodes, next few episodes, at,\n\n28\n00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:41.620\nlike Mike said,\nit's how does the software work.\n\n29\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.670\nIn this episode, more specifically,\nwhat we're gonna do is,\n\n30\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.781\nwe're gonna focus on one of\nthe common detection type out there.\n\n31\n00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:50.981\nThat's something know as\nsignature based scanning.\n\n32\n00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:53.472\nYou might even hear it called\nsignature based detection.\n\n33\n00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:56.652\nThe terms are synonymous\nwith one another there.\n\n34\n00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:59.675\nNow, what is it mean when we\ntalk about anti-virus and\n\n35\n00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:03.160\nwe talk about scanning before\nwe talk about signatures.\n\n36\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.920\nWell, if we take a look here,\nany type of anti-malware.\n\n37\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.614\nNow understand that I did label this\nbecause the concept is gonna be\n\n38\n00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:10.730\nsignature-based today.\n\n39\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.940\nBut even if you just take\nthe signature-based out of it,\n\n40\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.730\nwe just talk about anti-malware and\nwhat it's doing.\n\n41\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.550\nThe antivirus software that\nwe're gonna be looking at today\n\n42\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.040\nis going to be searching a database.\n\n43\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.094\nThere's a couple of common core components\nwithin antivirus software regardless of\n\n44\n00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:30.130\nthe detection method that's being used.\n\n45\n00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.990\nNumber one, well,\nfirst of all is a scanning service.\n\n46\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.230\nThe scanning service is what's looking\nin the areas across your hard drive.\n\n47\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.290\nLooking in your directories,\nlooking in your files, and\n\n48\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.480\nI know directories are just kind of\ncommon, and that's all encompassing.\n\n49\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.965\nBut, looking at things like the system\nfiles, maybe some common locations in your\n\n50\n00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:50.784\ntemporary files in the user profile,\nalright, but\n\n51\n00:02:50.784 --> 00:02:55.030\nit has to be able to have that execute or\nthat agent if you will to be able to scan.\n\n52\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.198\nNow here's what kinda differs from\none detection type to the other\n\n53\n00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:00.320\nis the database.\n\n54\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.450\nThe database of what's stored, what is\nthe criteria for identifying a virus?\n\n55\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.712\nWell when we talk about\nsignature based anti-virus what\n\n56\n00:03:07.712 --> 00:03:11.540\nwe're talking about is\na static scanning method.\n\n57\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.564\nAnd I don't even know if I\nshould say scanning method,\n\n58\n00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:15.050\nthe scanning methods are all dynamic.\n\n59\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.540\nBut, the scan that's going on\nis related to a static database.\n\n60\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.371\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n61\n00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.000\nWell, you have to know what a virus is.\n\n62\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.620\nThe service that's running, that scanning\nservice, regardless of what type it is,\n\n63\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.300\nit has to be able to identify a virus.\n\n64\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.221\nSo what it does it turns around and\nit references a database.\n\n65\n00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.697\nAnd then it compares it\nback to what it sees and\n\n66\n00:03:35.697 --> 00:03:37.791\nsees if it finds a match there, Mike.\n\n67\n00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.770\n>> And what is it looking\nat in that database then?\n\n68\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.480\nI imagine we don't go out and\ntalk to all their viruses and\n\n69\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.010\nwe get their autograph and\nwe have their signature there.\n\n70\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.501\n>> Yeah, typically that's\ndefinitely not the case there.\n\n71\n00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:52.950\nIt's not looking for the x on\nthe dotted line or anything like that.\n\n72\n00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.531\nWhat it's looking for, is it's looking for\na definition what the virus looks like.\n\n73\n00:03:57.531 --> 00:04:00.095\nAnd that's something you can\nsee this term kinda go back and\n\n74\n00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:02.511\nforth between virus definition and\nvirus signatures.\n\n75\n00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:04.730\nWell, what is the signature?\n\n76\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.329\nThe signature itself a lot of times is\nnothing more than like an MD5 value or\n\n77\n00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.280\na SHA 1 value.\n\n78\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.399\nNow, if you're not familiar\nwith those acronyms,\n\n79\n00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.262\nwe're talking about Message Digest 5 or\nSecure Hashing algorithm.\n\n80\n00:04:15.262 --> 00:04:19.730\nThese are just these one way\nencryption types as they talk about\n\n81\n00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.240\nit scans an entire file and\nit produces a fixed link value.\n\n82\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.940\nWell why is the fixed link\nvalue even important to us?\n\n83\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.410\nWell, if you've looked at some of the\nother security concepts that we've taught\n\n84\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.170\nabout, understand that value,\nthat fixed link value that's in there.\n\n85\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.850\nIf somebody modifies just a single\npunctuation mark in that code,\n\n86\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.370\nthe value no longer means any good to us.\n\n87\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.806\nNow, when we are detecting driver\nmodifications, programs have been altered,\n\n88\n00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:47.260\nthat is very good to see\nsigns of a detection.\n\n89\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.285\nBut the values that we are looking\nat are no different, but\n\n90\n00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:51.841\nthey identify the software.\n\n91\n00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.480\nSo what does it do?\n\n92\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.080\nThe scanning service looks down at\nlittle pieces of code, they across maybe\n\n93\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.780\nhopefully, hopefully not,\nspread across the entire operating system.\n\n94\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.201\nAnd it performs it's own function.\n\n95\n00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.557\nIt says, okay, I'm looking for this code,\n\n96\n00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:07.410\nlet me perform my own hash\nvalue of the code that I find.\n\n97\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.010\nLet me compare that back to the database.\n\n98\n00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.181\nThe database itself could have 100,\ncould have 1,000.\n\n99\n00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.970\nIn fact, let's check that out here.\n\n100\n00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.101\nI've actually got some examples here.\n\n101\n00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:19.970\nNow, this is an open source\ndatabase by the way, too.\n\n102\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.830\nSo it's probably a little bit out of date.\n\n103\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.470\nNow, you're probably saying that's\na whole bunch of mess here.\n\n104\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.820\nWell, it's not really so important that\nyou see every little individual component.\n\n105\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.505\nBut, one of the things that\nI do want you to notice is,\n\n106\n00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:34.010\nnotice that we have the name.\n\n107\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.030\nWhatever the name might be.\n\n108\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.590\n>> Right.\n\n109\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.970\n>> And then we have this crazy\nstring of characters out there.\n\n110\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.970\nNow those crazy string of characters\nreally don't mean much to me as\n\n111\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.790\na human but\nit means a lot to the scanner itself.\n\n112\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.880\n>> Yeah,\nyeah I'm familiar with hash values.\n\n113\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.240\nI know when I download a Linux distro from\nthe Internet I can get that NB5 value for\n\n114\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.420\nexample, and they've got one posted\non the web site that I can obtain.\n\n115\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.597\nI can run in through my own hashing\nalgorithm and if those two match,\n\n116\n00:05:58.597 --> 00:06:00.731\nthen I know that file\nhasn't been modified.\n\n117\n00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:02.671\nSo you're saying it's\nbasically the same thing.\n\n118\n00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:06.959\nIt sees a file on my computer,\nruns it through a hashing algorithm,\n\n119\n00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:08.251\ngenerates a value.\n\n120\n00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:12.290\nLooks in the database, to see if\nthat value exists in the database.\n\n121\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.410\nAnd if that value is in there,\nthen that's got to be the virus.\n\n122\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.146\n>> That's right,\n\n123\n00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:19.730\nand that's why sometime the term kinda\ngoes synonymous when we say signatures.\n\n124\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.372\nIf Mike was to sign something, and\nif I've seen Mike sign anything else,\n\n125\n00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:26.090\nthen I can compare the values\nbetween his signatures.\n\n126\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.150\nNow, obviously, that's not gonna be\nany kind of identity security or\n\n127\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.940\nanything like that.\n\n128\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.120\nBut, I can,\nat least I have a starting point.\n\n129\n00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.220\nI can say,\nwell that's got to be Mike's signature.\n\n130\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.940\nSo I recognize it as being Michael.\n\n131\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.140\nIt's no different.\n\n132\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.580\nIf you talk about a signature\ninside of that database.\n\n133\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.120\nIf I've scanned a location and\nI find a small piece of\n\n134\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.460\ncode that we run the same hashing\nalgorithm, just a little quick algorithm,\n\n135\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.730\nmathematical operation across that and\nthen I find that in the database.\n\n136\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.670\nThis point, they match.\n\n137\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.029\nI could say if it walks like a duck,\nI might be able to say that,\n\n138\n00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.501\nif it quakes like a duck,\nits got to be a duck.\n\n139\n00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:04.041\nI have the identification,\nI know what it is based on this database.\n\n140\n00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.471\nNow if you take a look at this database,\nand like I said it's not really so\n\n141\n00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:11.017\nimportant that you see every little\nnumber in here obviously cuz it's just\n\n142\n00:07:11.017 --> 00:07:12.210\na slew of characters.\n\n143\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.810\nBut what I wanna do is just scroll down.\n\n144\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.550\nAnd that's all I'm doing.\n\n145\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.190\nAnd hopefully you guys took your\nmotion sickness pills out there.\n\n146\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.056\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n147\n00:07:19.056 --> 00:07:22.010\nthe point here is how\nbig that database is?\n\n148\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.350\nThey have to be maintained.\n\n149\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.840\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat the vendors do.\n\n150\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.610\nWith the vendors, that offer their\nsoftware, offer their scanning services,\n\n151\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.170\nsee, this is an open source.\n\n152\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.400\nI can find it,\nyou guys are probably familiar.\n\n153\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.291\nIf it's coming from Linux,\nyou know distros and stuff like that.\n\n154\n00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.691\nWe can see the code.\n\n155\n00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:42.752\nWell the people that make their money\non this, their whole livelihood,\n\n156\n00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:46.262\nthe whole entire business is based on this\ndatabase, you're not gonna see it, and\n\n157\n00:07:46.262 --> 00:07:49.646\nthat's because it's proprietary,\nthey don't wanna see that information.\n\n158\n00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:54.165\nBut just understand that, that database is\nstored inside of the anti-virus software,\n\n159\n00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:56.225\nand going back to the scanning service.\n\n160\n00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:58.411\nThat's what it looks at,\nthat's what it references.\n\n161\n00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.932\nAll right so when it starts its inspection\nit looks at the code that they see now and\n\n162\n00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:05.210\nit looks at what it's already aware of.\n\n163\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.290\nNow I'm not making any modifications\nto any of these files here which\n\n164\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.730\nis another reason we\ncall it static scanning.\n\n165\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.480\nBecause nothing is changing.\n\n166\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.230\nSo one of things that's great\nabout this is that if you're\n\n167\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.190\naware of the virus itself and\nit's in the database.\n\n168\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.140\nWhen it scans a code in the local machine,\nhopefully it finds the code, or\n\n169\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.690\nmaybe it doesn't find the code, then\nyou're good, and it can at least take some\n\n170\n00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.195\nkind of counter measure based on whatever\nyou've chosen the countermeasures to be.\n\n171\n00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:39.015\nMaybe quarantine that virus,\nmaybe give you a time to perform reaction,\n\n172\n00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:41.795\nmaybe you set something like a severity\nlevel and say, hey if this is\n\n173\n00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:46.545\na high level virus here just don't even\nwait for me, quarantine it and remove it.\n\n174\n00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.715\nBut again that's all gonna be\ncontingent on that database and\n\n175\n00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:51.575\nthat's why that database is so important.\n\n176\n00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:54.295\nAnd it's one of the things that\nthe vendors out there protect,\n\n177\n00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:57.060\nprotecting their livelihood\nessentially there Mike.\n\n178\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.530\n>> So when we buy this antivirus\nsoftware and install it, it comes\n\n179\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.760\nwith this database and it's already got\na whole bunch of definitions in there.\n\n180\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.050\n>> Yeah and that's exactly it.\n\n181\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.940\nLike I said,\nwe can't really see where the data,\n\n182\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.010\nI guess we could do some\nreverse engineering, but\n\n183\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.757\nthere again keep in mind the fact that the\ncompanies, that's their livelihood, right?\n\n184\n00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:17.930\nSo they don't want\nthe hackers to know either.\n\n185\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.010\nIt's not about just keeping you out.\n\n186\n00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.160\nIt's about protecting\ntheir invested interest.\n\n187\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.410\nBut it's also about protecting\nus from the attackers, right.\n\n188\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.500\nSo if the attacker knows\nwhat the hash values are,\n\n189\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.360\nthen all the codes, their smart.\n\n190\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.970\nI mean that's why these viruses get\nout there, that's why they spread,\n\n191\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.870\nit's why they propagate.\n\n192\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.560\nThese are written by very\nintelligent people and\n\n193\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.700\nif they had access to that information,\n\n194\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.690\nthey could probably start\nto reverse engineer it.\n\n195\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.290\nAnd then the antivirus software\nreally doesn't do us any good and\n\n196\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.260\nwe're back to square one.\n\n197\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.020\n>> Yeah well from what I know about those\nhashing algorithms the reason they match\n\n198\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.160\nis because the files are exactly the same.\n\n199\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.300\nIf I know what that definition is\nI'm thinking I might be able to\n\n200\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.560\nchange my virus a little bit and\nit no longer matches that definition.\n\n201\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.080\n>> It's kind of weird\nhow that works right?\n\n202\n00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.260\nSo again when we talk about proof of code.\n\n203\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.370\nAnd in fact the whole reason hashing\nalgorithms, one of the very first reasons\n\n204\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.710\nwas to verify that the code that was\nworking on NASA's space systems.\n\n205\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.540\nI mean you don't want\nto be up in space and\n\n206\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.680\nfind out you've got\na bug in your software.\n\n207\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.460\nSo it was done really to start\nto proof check software and\n\n208\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.510\nit's the same thing we do from\na security implementation today.\n\n209\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.210\nWhere you know drivers and software,\nwe want to make sure it hasn't been\n\n210\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.310\nmodified and if it has been\nmodified we're made aware of it.\n\n211\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.600\nIt's the other way around\nwhen it comes to viruses.\n\n212\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.540\nThe reason we call it static because\nthere is not any modifications and\n\n213\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.980\nthat's probably one of the things that\n\n214\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.180\nyou have to be aware of with\nany kind of static detection.\n\n215\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.860\nIf any modifications are made in\nthe code produces an output that is\n\n216\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.840\ndifferent than what is stored\nin the database, unfortunately,\n\n217\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.490\nit's gonna like having the blinders on.\n\n218\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.470\nYou don't really see exactly.\n\n219\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.850\nThe scanner doesn't even\nknow that it exist.\n\n220\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.900\nAnd unfortunately infects the spreads and\nthen we have problems from there.\n\n221\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.550\nSo, again the database and the signatures\nare are very, very important.\n\n222\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.100\nTypically maintained by the vendors.\n\n223\n00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.490\nIt's gonna be something that, for the most\npart, you should download automatically.\n\n224\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.490\nWhen I say that a lot of the default\nsettings inside of your anti-virus\n\n225\n00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.810\nsoftware says,\nconnect to the vendor's website, right?\n\n226\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.430\nWell, the vendors themselves,\n\n227\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:11.130\nthey're the ones that are making\nthe signature definitions.\n\n228\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.650\nTheir signatures, I know I've said that\nto both, but they're synonymous terms.\n\n229\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.770\nThey do the research.\n\n230\n00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.000\nThey look at the code.\n\n231\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.180\nThey identify the code.\n\n232\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.460\nThey look at it's actions and\nthrough heavy monitoring and testing.\n\n233\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.450\nAnd then they produce the signatures\nthat are stored in that data base, and\n\n234\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.990\nthen they're distributed\nto the malware globally.\n\n235\n00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.490\nMalware?\nAnti-malware globally.\n\n236\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.370\nWe've gotta be careful with that one.\n\n237\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.090\nI'm gonna incriminate\nthe security companies out there.\n\n238\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.610\nThat's not what I meant.\n\n239\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:41.080\nBut what they do is they then deploy\nthose databases that are updated through\n\n240\n00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.760\nconstant monitoring, constant editions, so\n\n241\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.210\nthat we can just basically be aware of\nthe viruses that are across the globe.\n\n242\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.710\n>> So in my antivirus software\nsays it needs to update what it's\n\n243\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.820\ndoing is it's reaching out and talking to\nthat vendor And getting the latest and\n\n244\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.760\ngreatest definitions.\n\n245\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.770\nBecause I bought my software a month ago,\nsix months ago.\n\n246\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.130\nNew definitions have been created.\n\n247\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.140\nNew viruses have come out.\n\n248\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.240\nThey've found them.\n\n249\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.190\nThey've made definitions to match them.\n\n250\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.420\nBut I've gotta somehow get\nthose into my database.\n\n251\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.100\nIt resides in my copy of\nthat antivirus software.\n\n252\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.190\n>> That's right in fact let me\nsee if I can find it real quick.\n\n253\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.180\nThere is a good website out\nthere that you can go to and\n\n254\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.810\nthat website does a fairly good job.\n\n255\n00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.340\nLike I said let me find\nit here real quick.\n\n256\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.590\nYeah there we go.\n\n257\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.600\nSo what I've got here is\na website that can kind of show\n\n258\n00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.220\nyou what we're talking about here.\n\n259\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.290\nIt's called thread expert and they've\ngot a lot of the recognized viruses that\n\n260\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.365\ndifferent companies have\nseen around the world.\n\n261\n00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:39.825\nRight?\nWell what do they mean to us?\n\n262\n00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.495\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin here a little bit.\n\n263\n00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.305\nThere we go.\n\n264\n00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:44.755\nSo look at this list right here.\n\n265\n00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:48.245\nFindings, Origin,\nit tells you some of the contraries here.\n\n266\n00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:52.569\nYou can see one I think is [INAUDIBLE]\nidentify there origin here.\n\n267\n00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:54.626\nBut notice what it says, right?\n\n268\n00:12:54.626 --> 00:12:58.168\nIt says there's a trojan\nbackdoor virus downloader, right?\n\n269\n00:12:58.168 --> 00:13:00.240\nSo different types of malware.\n\n270\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.200\nWell, okay so\nthat's the name of the malware.\n\n271\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.960\nWhat is it actually using?\n\n272\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.350\nWell, if I go in here one of the things\nthat I can see directly related\n\n273\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:16.090\nto what Mike was saying, I've got\nthe time that this virus was identified.\n\n274\n00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.180\nThis virus is identified and\nthey put it in a database.\n\n275\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.770\nThey say how long did it take to find it.\n\n276\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.790\nWhat are the values?\n\n277\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.590\nRemember Mike and I were talking\nabout those hash values right.\n\n278\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.050\nWell there's your MD5 value and\n\n279\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.740\nit says that when they looked\nat that code they scanned it.\n\n280\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.830\nThey ran a hash value once they had\nidentified it, it produced this value.\n\n281\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:42.070\nSo that if this value is in your database\nfor the software that you're using,\n\n282\n00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.270\nand it finds,\nI'm not even can't remember, there we go.\n\n283\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.520\nIf it finds this Trojan.Artilb,\nright, it finds the code.\n\n284\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.460\nIt doesn't care about the name.\n\n285\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.830\nI could change a file name.\n\n286\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.160\nIt doesn't change how it acts.\n\n287\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.800\nSo it looks into the file itself and\n\n288\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.040\nit says, okay,\nI'm gonna run the same hashing algorithm.\n\n289\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.210\nI'm gonna run an MD5, or I'm gonna run\na shaw 1, right, and when I do that,\n\n290\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.710\nif I find these values right here, right,\n\n291\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.025\nif I find that value there,\nthen I've identified a virus.\n\n292\n00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:16.635\nAll right, at least what we hope\nis we've identified a virus,\n\n293\n00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:17.915\nall right and the same thing okay so\n\n294\n00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:21.585\nmaybe they performed a MD5 hash against\nit right just a different algorithm,\n\n295\n00:14:21.585 --> 00:14:24.335\njust a different mathematical operation\nand they didn't find the virus.\n\n296\n00:14:24.335 --> 00:14:27.555\nWell now they perform a different\nhashing algorithm and\n\n297\n00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:30.350\nguess what, produces a different value.\n\n298\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.306\nBut if I have both of these\nvalues in that database,\n\n299\n00:14:35.306 --> 00:14:42.706\nthen what that means is I should be\nable to identify this virus, this virus.\n\n300\n00:14:42.706 --> 00:14:45.353\nWait a second, this virus,\nthat virus, here a virus.\n\n301\n00:14:45.353 --> 00:14:46.236\nWhat's up with that?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:46.816\n>> Right?\n\n303\n00:14:46.816 --> 00:14:47.929\nWell what is it doing?\n\n304\n00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:51.949\nWell, here's one of the things that's\ncommon to some of these static scanning\n\n305\n00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:52.910\nmethods, right?\n\n306\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.630\nIs that when you have an anti,\nor I keep saying anti virus.\n\n307\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.830\nWhen you have a virus itself,\n\n308\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.980\na piece of malware,\nthere is a lot of times a commonality.\n\n309\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.010\nA commonality in the code\nbetween a single virus.\n\n310\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.530\nWell, you say, what commonality,\nthat means more than one, right?\n\n311\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.470\nWell, maybe that first one that\nwas in the list got identified.\n\n312\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd the hacker now, or attacker if you\nwill, knows that it's been recognized.\n\n313\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.840\nWell if the symantecs it can\nchange it up a little bit,\n\n314\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.050\nremember what we told you\nabout the hash values, right?\n\n315\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.290\nWe download drivers if one punctuation\nmark in the entire file in the entire\n\n316\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.220\ndriver package has changed,\nthis value changes.\n\n317\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.210\nWell guess what.\n\n318\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.560\nIf an attacker can change the symantecs\nof the file but it doesn't change it's\n\n319\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.580\naction, well now that value that I have\nright here doesn't do me any good.\n\n320\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.590\nSo, what they do in the detection\nprocess is they find virus Families, and\n\n321\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.520\nthat's what this is.\n\n322\n00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.644\nNow, it can be identified, and\nyou can see Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee,\n\n323\n00:15:50.644 --> 00:15:52.616\neven Microsoft is in there, right.\n\n324\n00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:57.572\nSo what they've done is they've found\na common code structure that each one of\n\n325\n00:15:57.572 --> 00:15:59.313\nthese viruses is sharing.\n\n326\n00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:01.163\nSo it becomes a virus family,\n\n327\n00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:05.000\nnow does that mean that it's\ngonna find it every time?\n\n328\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.900\nNot necessarily, and\nthat's one of the drawbacks, I would say,\n\n329\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.690\nto static definition.\n\n330\n00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:14.670\nIf I can find a way to code to change this\nup a little bit, well now unfortunately\n\n331\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.760\nyour static database says,\nI don't know what I'm looking for.\n\n332\n00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.970\nI can't see it,\nI'm using these values again.\n\n333\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.780\nDon't worry about the name.\n\n334\n00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.640\nThe names mean nothing.\n\n335\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.660\nIt's these values that are important.\n\n336\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.850\nNow that the value is changed,\nunfortunately,\n\n337\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.190\nthe virus goes to the scanner,\nthe scanner doesn't see it.\n\n338\n00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.350\nWe think we're clean, says hey,\nyou're all good in the hood.\n\n339\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.680\nNow we don't understand why our files\nare being deleted, or we've got a lot of\n\n340\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.400\nnetwork activity, we can't figure out why\nwe're getting billed by other people.\n\n341\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.530\nYou have to be careful there.\n\n342\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.720\nAgain, one of the good\nthings about this anti-virus\n\n343\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.220\nsoftware is because it is a static\nscanning process, alright?\n\n344\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.360\nNothing changes.\n\n345\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.910\nIt's less computational heavy, alright?\n\n346\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.970\nI can't say that it doesn't take CPU, it\ntakes power to do any kind of scanning and\n\n347\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.250\nperform any kind of scan.\n\n348\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.470\nThat's going to be a definite.\n\n349\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.810\nBut in some of the other dynamic concepts\nthat we'll talk about in other episodes\n\n350\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.900\nright, it takes less CPU strength\nwhich also has another benefit.\n\n351\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.260\nI get to my answer quicker, right?\n\n352\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.410\nIf I say do a quick scan.\n\n353\n00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.360\nWell what's a quick scan?\n\n354\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.220\nThat says look at the common locations\nwhere we know that these viruses through\n\n355\n00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.760\nthe companies here that have\ntested have found these viruses.\n\n356\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.630\nSo look in those areas first, and\n\n357\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.110\nsince you're using a static definition\nall I'm saying is what do I see?\n\n358\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.950\nWhat do I see?\n\n359\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.375\nWhat's this?\n\n360\n00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:32.110\nOkay, here's the code,\ndo I have a database?\n\n361\n00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.510\nDo I have it in the database?\n\n362\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.680\nI don't have to process\nany additional logic,\n\n363\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.990\nso it is beneficial in the fact that\nit can identify known viruses quickly.\n\n364\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.040\nAll right, but\nthe problem is any modifications,\n\n365\n00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.120\nthat's where we start\nto run into problems.\n\n366\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.570\n>> And I think you just answered\nBen's question for him there.\n\n367\n00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.690\nSo if a virus puts in a simple counter for\nevery time its encountered or run or\n\n368\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.410\nduplicated, how do my definitions\ncontinue to match that virus?\n\n369\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.770\nAnd the answer is, one, they don't.\n\n370\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.260\n>> Yes.\n>> But two, that sometimes they're not\n\n371\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.140\nmatching the entire virus.\n\n372\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.950\nThere's some common runtime\nelements in that virus.\n\n373\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.030\nAnd we can say, we can find that\nchunk we know that's a virus.\n\n374\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.760\nWhatever flop they have around it,\n>> That's right.\n\n375\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.288\n>> It's still might\nmatch that definition or\n\n376\n00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:17.673\nwe have to move on to a different\ntype of scanning method.\n\n377\n00:18:17.673 --> 00:18:20.234\n>> That's it.\nYou gotta get a, throw in the towel and\n\n378\n00:18:20.234 --> 00:18:23.940\nsay, hey, this scanning method\nis no longer working for us so\n\n379\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.530\nmaybe we have to go to other method,\nother scanning types.\n\n380\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.140\nAnd that's a great question to ask,\nbecause that's one of the limitation to\n\n381\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.660\nany kind of static scanning process or\na static database that doesn't change.\n\n382\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.230\nAnd the commonality of those the family of\nthose viruses, if we can find a specific\n\n383\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.590\ncode that they all share, then we can use\none hash value just looking for that code.\n\n384\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.590\nAnd we're not really worried about,\nlike Mike said,\n\n385\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.660\nall the fluff and the flare that's around\nit when it's actually the execution part\n\n386\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.460\nthat we're probably looking at.\n\n387\n00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.634\nSince they share them, one of these can,\none of these definitions or\n\n388\n00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.828\none of these signatures can be used for\na whole truckload of viruses.\n\n389\n00:18:58.828 --> 00:19:03.910\n>> And I think in the previous episode, we\ntalked about something called polymorphic.\n\n390\n00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.950\nIf I can say that.\n\n391\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.320\n>> Yeah.\n>> Polymorphic viruses and\n\n392\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.545\nthat's really why they came about was to\ndefeat this definition based Anti-Virus or\n\n393\n00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:12.830\nAnti-Malware software.\n\n394\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.810\n>> You got it,\nthat's absolutely correct, and\n\n395\n00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.200\nthat's one of the things again that\nbecome a little problematic for,\n\n396\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.610\nagain going back to one of the cons\n>> Using a static database like this is\n\n397\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.280\nbecause if you have these,\nagain these attackers are smart.\n\n398\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.110\nThey know what they're doing, right?\n\n399\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.280\nAnd if not,\nthey're gonna figure it out eventually.\n\n400\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.070\nBut if you've got a piece\nof code that says write\n\n401\n00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.920\nyourself to a temporary directory, stay\nthere for a second, delete the file and\n\n402\n00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.870\nthen write yourself back\nin a different form.\n\n403\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.290\n>> Well the semantics have changed but\nlike we know,\n\n404\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.620\na single punctuation mark's changed in the\ncode and the signature no longer matches.\n\n405\n00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.250\nAnd unfortunately it slips\nthrough the radar and\n\n406\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.510\nthat's one of the reasons that it\nstarts to shred and we're unaware.\n\n407\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:20:01.390\nAnd that's another reason your vendors\nare just constantly around the clock.\n\n408\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.880\nStudying the actions that\nthese viruses perform so\n\n409\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.170\nthey can identify the traits behind them.\n\n410\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.560\nIdentify the code that performing the\naction, so we can figure out if it's fluff\n\n411\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.900\naround here and they're doing that they're\nmaking a modification of the data so\n\n412\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.570\nit doesn't match the database\nthat were using in order to scan.\n\n413\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:23.130\nSo that's one of the things that we\ndefinitely have to watch out for the pro,\n\n414\n00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.730\nkinda recap here.\n\n415\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.910\nThe pro of this type of signature\nscanning is that I get my answer quicker.\n\n416\n00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.640\nIt doesn't take quite as\nmuch computational power.\n\n417\n00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.120\nAnd off topic though, but if you think\nabout a password cracking attack,\n\n418\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.140\nI can use things like rainbow\ntables cuz what does it do.\n\n419\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.890\nI've already got my answers and\nI'm just scanning the answers, all right.\n\n420\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.780\nOr I could make the logic, and\nit could go through and it could try to\n\n421\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.670\nsolve all of those questions that\nit doesn't have answers to, right.\n\n422\n00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.260\nIt's gonna take a longer time,\nall right, but the static method says,\n\n423\n00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.700\nI already have my answers.\n\n424\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.540\nAnd if my answer is in that list,\nthen we could find it, we could remedy it,\n\n425\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.520\nand hopefully we can get to the answer and\nthe solution a little bit quicker.\n\n426\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.100\n>> Very good.\n\n427\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.710\nAlright Wes, well a lot of great\ninformation there dealing with Anti-Virus\n\n428\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:10.280\nsoftware in particular our signature based\nAnti-Virus or Anti-Malware software.\n\n429\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.435\nAnything else we need to talk about before\nwe part ways with our viewers here?\n\n430\n00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:17.349\n>> No, maybe the only one other thing\nthat I would like to show you is\n\n431\n00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:20.710\njust kind of what we're looking at here.\n\n432\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.430\nSo if we look at the machine one\nof the things that we'll see\n\n433\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.310\nhere is that I have viruses,\nknown viruses, on one side here.\n\n434\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.370\nOn the other side, what I end up\nhaving are malware definitions,\n\n435\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.480\nand what the definitions or\nwhat the signatures look like.\n\n436\n00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.040\nAnd it's no different than what we\nwere just seeing here Mike, right?\n\n437\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.468\nSo what it's doing, the scanning\ndatabase is looking through it.\n\n438\n00:21:39.468 --> 00:21:42.670\nIt's saying, hey, do I have, and again,\nremember the names really don't mean much.\n\n439\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.680\nThat's how they identify them and\nthey say okay, we gotta call it something.\n\n440\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.160\nWe can't call it just\nspecial character [CROSSTALK]\n\n441\n00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.930\n>> EF39427816, yeah.\n\n442\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.460\n>> That's right.\n\n443\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.920\nSo the names are more for us humans,\nbut it looks through that code and\n\n444\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.850\nthen it compares it back to the database\nof these signatures that are in here.\n\n445\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.380\nAnd again, if the signatures are there.\n\n446\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.070\nThey have that hash value in there.\n\n447\n00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:06.850\nWe identify it, we're good to go,\nbut there again if the hashing value\n\n448\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.410\nisn't in that data base then unfortunately\nwe've gotta problem, and we've gotta move\n\n449\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.140\nto some of the other techniques that we're\ngonna be looking at a little bit later.\n\n450\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.600\n>> Yeah, and\nprobably another thing we should\n\n451\n00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.520\nstress to is the importance of keeping\nthat database up to date and often.\n\n452\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.790\n>> Right, new viruses come out every day.\n\n453\n00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.770\nThese vendors are writing\nnew definitions every day.\n\n454\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.480\nSo if you're updating your\nAnti-Virus database once a week,\n\n455\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.100\nyou're really putting yourself at risk,\nbecause you're going for\n\n456\n00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.960\na period of time where you could have\nprotection against that virus but instead,\n\n457\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.670\nyou don't have it because you don't want\nit to go out every night, and get those.\n\n458\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.500\nSo, keeping that Anti-Virus database\nup to date, is extremely important.\n\n459\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.620\nHaving an out of date anti-virus database,\n\n460\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.050\nis almost as good as not running\nan anti-virus software at all.\n\n461\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:47.790\n>> That is so true.\n\n462\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.750\nIn fact you know, one of the things\nthat we can do, I tell you what Mike,\n\n463\n00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.090\nlet's show a scan finding\na virus real quick.\n\n464\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.330\n>> Lets do it.\n>> Let's go ahead and\n\n465\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.170\ndo that, rather than talk about it.\n\n466\n00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.410\nLet's go ahead and show them.\n\n467\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:02.240\nSo one of the things that we have,\nnow understand you guys, a little\n\n468\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.570\nbit of smoke and mirrors, we gotta we\ngotta tell the magician trick here.\n\n469\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:11.120\nWe're using a known file,\nalright this is a test file, alright, and\n\n470\n00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.790\nit comes from ichor is Swedish company,\nI believe in the UK.\n\n471\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.702\nI probably got that completely wrong,\nsorry guys out there if I did.\n\n472\n00:23:18.702 --> 00:23:22.400\nBut ichor, they produce these\ntest files so that you can\n\n473\n00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.210\ntest whether your scanning services\nrun and their effectiveness, right.\n\n474\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.080\nThere's nothing worse than\nif you were to buy, and\n\n475\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.100\nI'm not accusing anybody of anything.\n\n476\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.550\nBut let's say we've got that third party\ntype of malware software that we're not\n\n477\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.890\nreally sure that we trust and\nthey're telling us go ahead and\n\n478\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.040\nyou can just bet the farm on us.\n\n479\n00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.257\nYou've got real-time protection.\n\n480\n00:23:42.257 --> 00:23:43.640\nWell, you might wanna test it,\n\n481\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.560\nyou might wanna find out before\nyou deploy it within a network\n\n482\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.820\nif the real-time protection and tell them\nto put their money where their mouth is.\n\n483\n00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.684\nSo, let's go ahead and show you that.\n\n484\n00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:55.047\nNow, again, understand that these\nfiles and I can show you, in fact,\n\n485\n00:23:55.047 --> 00:23:57.618\none of the, let's do a little edit here.\n\n486\n00:23:57.618 --> 00:24:02.530\nAnd some of you guys might have seen\nthis before, this is a string of\n\n487\n00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.630\ndata that is known to be, in fact I\nwas gonna say known to be a virus.\n\n488\n00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:12.635\nIt's not really even a virus,\nit really is just a string\n\n489\n00:24:12.635 --> 00:24:16.897\nof characters that most\nof your major antivirus\n\n490\n00:24:16.897 --> 00:24:21.601\ncompanies have used quite\nliterally as a test file.\n\n491\n00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:25.463\nAnd they recognize that in their\nsoftware as being a virus.\n\n492\n00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:27.450\nAnd you can see there,\nit says right there,\n\n493\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.507\nthat card's standard Antivirus test file.\n\n494\n00:24:29.507 --> 00:24:32.623\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's put that on our desktop,\n\n495\n00:24:32.623 --> 00:24:37.332\nwe'll fire up old Windows Defender here\nand see, give it a run for it's money and\n\n496\n00:24:37.332 --> 00:24:38.800\nsee if it actually does.\n\n497\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.456\n>> That's right.\n\n498\n00:24:39.456 --> 00:24:41.041\n>> What it says it should do.\n\n499\n00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:45.615\nLooks like the computer is running\na little bit slow here because I've got\n\n500\n00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:48.090\n143 of however many updates [LAUGH].\n\n501\n00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:51.478\nSo it's currently in the background\nperforming updates, looks like it's,\n\n502\n00:24:51.478 --> 00:24:55.033\nlike I said, a little sluggish here so\nhopefully the scan doesn't take too long.\n\n503\n00:24:55.033 --> 00:24:57.790\nIn fact we can kinda rifle this down and\nI can make it a little bit easier.\n\n504\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.523\nWhat we'll do is, when we go to our scan,\nI'm gonna do a custom scan, and\n\n505\n00:25:01.523 --> 00:25:03.169\nI'm gonna point it right here.\n\n506\n00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:07.980\nSo like I said guys, let's be careful here\nwith the smoke and mirrors and make sure.\n\n507\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.010\nI'm gonna go to the user, in fact I'll\ngo a little bit more specific than that.\n\n508\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.787\nI know I'm on user one, and\nwe're gonna say you, just just look for\n\n509\n00:25:14.787 --> 00:25:17.125\nthe user and we'll go ahead and do a scan.\n\n510\n00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:21.904\nNow, hopefully like I said, hairball here,\nhopefully this, hopefully this doesn't\n\n511\n00:25:21.904 --> 00:25:25.360\ntake too long and what it's doing\nis it's going to the profile.\n\n512\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.570\nNow, what you're quick scans\ndoing is giving us a custom scan,\n\n513\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.760\nwhat quick scans do is they\ngo through common locations.\n\n514\n00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.370\nWhat I'm doing with a custom scan is,\nsince I know this\n\n515\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.870\nis gonna be seen as a virus,\nI'm kinda narrowing down the search.\n\n516\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.071\nAnd what I'm doing is saying,\nyou know what, I want you to go ahead and\n\n517\n00:25:42.071 --> 00:25:43.611\nlook just through the user file.\n\n518\n00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:46.273\nIn fact you can see here\nit's not taking too long.\n\n519\n00:25:46.273 --> 00:25:49.190\nBut it's kinda interesting\nscanning the user directory and\n\n520\n00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.600\nthere's still a lot of\nfiles that I'm scanning.\n\n521\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.610\n>> Absolutely and I use that method\na lot when I've got a folder that I\n\n522\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.350\ndownload things into from sites\nthat I might not trust completely.\n\n523\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.140\nAnd before I move that file anywhere\nelse on my machine, I scan that folder.\n\n524\n00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.650\nI don't wanna do a quick scan because I\ndon't need to scan those other areas.\n\n525\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.900\nI know that I've got\nthat scanning going on.\n\n526\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.438\nEvery day and it's keeping me safe.\n\n527\n00:26:11.438 --> 00:26:12.885\nI just downloaded something.\n\n528\n00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:13.959\nI want to scan it right now.\n\n529\n00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:15.734\nSo you can point it to an individual file.\n\n530\n00:26:15.734 --> 00:26:16.291\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n531\n00:26:16.291 --> 00:26:18.583\ntell it to scan if you really want to.\n\n532\n00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:19.843\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n533\n00:26:19.843 --> 00:26:23.935\n>> And the other thing here is, what\nabout the opposite side of the tracks?\n\n534\n00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:26.915\nWhat if you like for instance, I know\nthat you're in security a lot there.\n\n535\n00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:29.289\nWhat if you're testing security software?\n\n536\n00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:31.895\nAnd you've got the box of rattlesnakes.\n\n537\n00:26:31.895 --> 00:26:33.758\nThat here in a virtualized\nenvironment of course.\n\n538\n00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:34.367\nBut guess what?\n\n539\n00:26:34.367 --> 00:26:36.880\nVirtual machines don't have\nantivirus software on them.\n\n540\n00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.904\nAnd I don't want to quarantine that.\n\n541\n00:26:39.904 --> 00:26:44.114\nSo just as you can say, scan here,\nyou can also say put the blinders on and\n\n542\n00:26:44.114 --> 00:26:45.233\ndon't scan here.\n\n543\n00:26:45.233 --> 00:26:48.563\n>> I have a folder on my\nsecond drive called no scan.\n\n544\n00:26:48.563 --> 00:26:52.145\n>> I swear I haven't been\nattacking your computer Mike.\n\n545\n00:26:52.145 --> 00:26:53.253\nI didn't know that, I just assumed.\n\n546\n00:26:53.253 --> 00:26:54.505\n[LAUGH]\n>> But if you wanna play around\n\n547\n00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:58.485\nwith some of those security tools,\nany kinda password cracker or\n\n548\n00:26:58.485 --> 00:27:02.330\neven some of the packet caps utilities and\nthings like that.\n\n549\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.106\nThose antivirus softwares, they might\nsee it and go, oh that's bad and\n\n550\n00:27:05.106 --> 00:27:05.750\nquarantine it.\n\n551\n00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.952\nAnd depending on what you've\ngot your settings on,\n\n552\n00:27:07.952 --> 00:27:09.470\nit might delete it just like that.\n\n553\n00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.080\nAnd I took a lot of time to\ngather up all those tools.\n\n554\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.198\nSo it's definitely advantageous sometimes\nto have a place you tell your antivirus,\n\n555\n00:27:16.198 --> 00:27:17.350\nhey this is off limits.\n\n556\n00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.889\nYou don't get to scan this folder.\n\n557\n00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:23.479\n>> Yeah, and it looks like our\nantivirus software actually put its\n\n558\n00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:27.475\nmoney where its mouth is, and\nit found our system here.\n\n559\n00:27:27.475 --> 00:27:29.802\nSo let's go ahead and show you that.\n\n560\n00:27:29.802 --> 00:27:32.720\nAnd I was hoping I could zoom in\nhere a little bit and show you this.\n\n561\n00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.880\nSo notice it says, Review harmful or\npotential unwanted software.\n\n562\n00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.382\nLike I said guys, keep in mind,\nso we're just being honest here,\n\n563\n00:27:41.382 --> 00:27:43.900\nthis is a known file for\ntesting your software.\n\n564\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.340\nAnd it looks like it's showing\nus some good information here.\n\n565\n00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.456\nNow, tell you what,\nlet me get into this software and\n\n566\n00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:54.485\nmake it a little bit easier for\nyou guys to see out there, hopefully.\n\n567\n00:27:57.231 --> 00:27:58.614\nNow I say that.\n\n568\n00:27:58.614 --> 00:28:01.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it looks like it's taking its time.\n\n569\n00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.871\nSo, what it said here is,\n\n570\n00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:06.836\nyou can see that the tool, there we go,\nthe tool it's using there.\n\n571\n00:28:06.836 --> 00:28:08.770\nThere we go, which, whoa!\n\n572\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.855\nHey!\nDo you guys got that out there?\n\n573\n00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, boy didn't that work.\n\n574\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.363\nLet's try that again.\n\n575\n00:28:15.363 --> 00:28:16.625\nAll right, there we go.\n\n576\n00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:17.838\nThat's a little bit easier.\n\n577\n00:28:17.838 --> 00:28:18.960\nSo, now you can actually see it.\n\n578\n00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.102\nNotice that it's finding that information.\n\n579\n00:28:21.102 --> 00:28:22.362\nIt's finding that file.\n\n580\n00:28:22.362 --> 00:28:26.700\nAnd what I really like to point out is,\nit found it in quite a few locations.\n\n581\n00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.786\nSee files themselves don't generally,\nor viruses themselves,\n\n582\n00:28:31.786 --> 00:28:35.432\ndon't necessarily have\nto be in one location.\n\n583\n00:28:35.432 --> 00:28:37.901\nAnd it didn't only find it on the desktop.\n\n584\n00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:41.475\nEven though I told it,\njust scan the desktop.\n\n585\n00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:45.401\nThe real time protection in the background\nis actually at some other common locations\n\n586\n00:28:45.401 --> 00:28:47.725\nas well just as a part of\nits real time protection.\n\n587\n00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:50.570\nIt says I found it in\nyour shared folders too.\n\n588\n00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.840\nEven though I said scan the user profile,\n\n589\n00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.460\nI found it in a shared\nfolder in another location.\n\n590\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.768\nSo guess what?\n\n591\n00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:57.705\nWe've got to remove it.\n\n592\n00:28:57.705 --> 00:29:00.240\nSo let's go ahead now that it's found it.\n\n593\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.953\nLet's apply the action and\nI could say clean system.\n\n594\n00:29:03.953 --> 00:29:06.130\nThe default action is clean\nthe system by the way.\n\n595\n00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.670\nSo what it's gonna do is now\nthat it's identified it,\n\n596\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.240\nit's gonna quarantine it and\nthen it's gonna erase it.\n\n597\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.296\nAnd then hopefully, from there we should\nbe remediated I guess I should say and\n\n598\n00:29:15.296 --> 00:29:16.289\nwe're good to go.\n\n599\n00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:18.990\nSo, we found a virus,\nwe infected our systems.\n\n600\n00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.550\nIt did monitor it.\n\n601\n00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.790\nIt found it, we quarantined it, and\n\n602\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.710\nwhen this machine gets done deleting\nit we should be good to go, so, yeah.\n\n603\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.305\nLooks like it works and\nit looks like Windows Defender,\n\n604\n00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:31.803\nwe've got a clean system now and\nit's doing its job.\n\n605\n00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:32.360\n>> All right.\n\n606\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.350\nWell, Wes a lot of great\ninformation there.\n\n607\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.506\nI mean really explaining how\nthis antivirus software works.\n\n608\n00:29:37.506 --> 00:29:42.800\nHow does it detect a virus or\na piece of malware on my system?\n\n609\n00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.743\nAnd, this particular method, that\nsignature based that means my antivirus\n\n610\n00:29:47.743 --> 00:29:51.782\nsoftware is maintaining a database\nthat has signatures in it.\n\n611\n00:29:51.782 --> 00:29:54.757\nAnd when it does scans,\nit's scanning my files.\n\n612\n00:29:54.757 --> 00:29:57.240\nIt's generating signatures on those files.\n\n613\n00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.020\nIt's comparing them to the signatures\nof known bad files in this database and\n\n614\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.890\nif it finds one,\nwell that means it's a match and\n\n615\n00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.120\nit's a bad thing and\nthen it quarantines it.\n\n616\n00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.670\nThat way it keeps our system safe.\n\n617\n00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.350\nWe can't mess with it, it's in quarantine.\n\n618\n00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.154\nNow, maybe it identified a mistakenly.\n\n619\n00:30:13.154 --> 00:30:17.653\nWe can take it out of quarantine, but it's\npinned up in there until we decide what to\n\n620\n00:30:17.653 --> 00:30:21.690\ndo, if we want to delete it, remove it,\ntry to clean it, what have you.\n\n621\n00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.370\nSo that's how these particular antivirus\nsoftware keep our system safe.\n\n622\n00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.360\nAnd Wes, I know there's other types\nthat we're gonna talk about, but\n\n623\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.920\nunfortunately, we're out of time for\nthis episode so\n\n624\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.830\nwe're gonna have to come back and tell you\nall about those other scanning methods.\n\n625\n00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.645\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n626\n00:30:37.645 --> 00:30:38.580\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n627\n00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.609\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:30:39.609 -->

--> 00:00:10.646\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:15.135\ntoday we're gonna be\nlooking at anti-virus,\n\n5\n00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:20.182\nanti-malware, and\nspecifically we're going to be\n\n6\n00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:26.052\nlooking at heuristic based anti-virus and\nanti-malware.\n\n7\n00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:29.820\nHeuristics, mm-hm I don't know but\nwho do I have, Wes with me here.\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.470\nHe's going to explain all that to us.\n\n9\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was just saying,\n\n10\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.410\nit's kind of interesting we were\ntalking about before we started,\n\n11\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.050\nI said sometimes I have a problem\nspelling words like is, and the and IT.\n\n12\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.334\nBut I managed to spell\nheuristics right today.\n\n13\n00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.010\nSo, heuristics.\n\n14\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.410\nWhat is heuristics all about?\n\n15\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.359\nWell, in a previous episode one of the\nthings that we started talking about is\n\n16\n00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.950\nsignature-based scanning.\n\n17\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.790\nAnd we talked about definitions.\n\n18\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.340\nWe talked about virus signatures.\n\n19\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.060\nWe talked about a static method.\n\n20\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.740\nAnd you might say well why are we\nbringing that up in this episode?\n\n21\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.966\nWell, you really have to do\na little bit of a compare and\n\n22\n00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.600\ncontrast to understand\nwhat heuristics is doing.\n\n23\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.170\nNow one of the things to understand is\nthat all antivirus software has to have\n\n24\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.300\nsome kind of scanning service, an agent\nthat is gonna be monitoring files,\n\n25\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.730\nmonitoring folders,\nmonitoring your directory hierarchy there.\n\n26\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.510\nSo that's gonna be, again,\n\n27\n00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.420\nassociated with any kind of anti-malware,\nanti-virus program.\n\n28\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.600\nBut heuristics is a little bit different.\n\n29\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.360\nWhen we look at signature based\nreferencing back to signature\n\n30\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.140\nbased definitions.\n\n31\n00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140\nWe know what the signatures define\nwhat the viruses look like.\n\n32\n00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.342\nWell, when they define what\nthe viruses look like then if\n\n33\n00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:38.542\nwe've got that definition or\nsignature in a database and\n\n34\n00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:42.690\nthe scanning service goes through your\nfolder hierarchy it finds a file.\n\n35\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.810\nWell what is it doing?\n\n36\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.760\nIt's looking back to this signature.\n\n37\n00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.345\nNow one of the things we also mentioned\nand go back and watch that episode if\n\n38\n00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:52.670\nyou're not familiar with these concepts,\nis that those signature strings are static\n\n39\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.900\nentries on a data base and\nthey really don't change.\n\n40\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.220\nHere's the problem with that.\n\n41\n00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.360\nOne of the things that these hackers\ncan do and they are very good.\n\n42\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.430\nHackers are brilliant people right?\n\n43\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.050\nThey're just on the wrong side of the law.\n\n44\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.580\nOne of the things that the can do is they\ncan find ways to make polymorphic viruses.\n\n45\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.310\nRight, polymorphic what does it mean?\n\n46\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.390\nIt just means that the code\nis going to change.\n\n47\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.820\nAnd they've got clever ways.\n\n48\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.590\nLike one of the ways I was reading\nabout is the file itself has got logic\n\n49\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.280\nprogrammed into the code, I guess.\n\n50\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.930\nIt's got logic programmed in it.\n\n51\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.440\nIt says, write yourself to a temporary\nlocation, change the code and\n\n52\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.740\nwrite yourself back.\n\n53\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.690\nWhatever is dependent on the virus.\n\n54\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.340\nThe virus's actions that\nare going to be performed.\n\n55\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.290\nAnd now the problem is when your\nscanning service goes back and\n\n56\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.720\nlooks through those files.\n\n57\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.470\nAnd, compares it back to the database.\n\n58\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.175\nThe signatures no longer match, why?\n\n59\n00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:44.660\nBecause it's still gonna have to\nperform some low level checks,\n\n60\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.780\nsome little mathematical operation\nto see if it can find that value.\n\n61\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.190\nBut, the problem is that\nthe code has changed, right?\n\n62\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.850\nYou've probably seen before,\nwe've talked about, in other concepts and\n\n63\n00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.610\nother episodes, we've talked about\nthings like drivers and softwares.\n\n64\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.320\nYou wanna be able to verify that\nit came from the publisher, right?\n\n65\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.342\nSo we run digital signatures across it,\nand if just one little punctuation mark\n\n66\n00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:06.103\nchanges in that file,\nthe signature doesn't match,\n\n67\n00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:09.960\nwe know there's some kind of modification\nto it, let's stay away from it.\n\n68\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.322\nBut it's the opposite way, still the same\nprocess, same type of algorithms, but\n\n69\n00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:16.690\nif the files change, the algorithms never,\n\n70\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.660\nthey don't produce the right\noutput that matches the signature.\n\n71\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.820\nAnd sometimes, Mike,\nI'll tell ya, those viruses.\n\n72\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.370\nThey go under the radar and\nyou don't even know they're there.\n\n73\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.510\nSo that's one of the first things that we\nhave to know about heuristics, is the fact\n\n74\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.090\nthat we can find viruses when they don't\nnecessarily have a full definition or\n\n75\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.910\nsignature inside of that database.\n\n76\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.640\n&gt;&gt; So there's gotta be then some\nway we're identifying this virus.\n\n77\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.400\nIf we're not doing it by signature,\nwhat are we using?\n\n78\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that's interesting.\n\n79\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.290\nThis is a little bit\ndifferent than signatures and\n\n80\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.440\nthe fact that they're a static database,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.494\nThe definitions they change, but\n\n82\n00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:52.540\nit's not the definition where\nthe signature itself is changing.\n\n83\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.090\nIt's the fact that we're adding some too.\n\n84\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.787\nAs new viruses come out, that database\ngrows, so you gotta be careful with it.\n\n85\n00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:03.433\nIt's dynamic in that aspect, but the\nsignatures inside of them don't change.\n\n86\n00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.080\nSo heuristics applies\na few other concepts.\n\n87\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.840\nAnd if we check this out here.\n\n88\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.620\nIf I actually got that database,\nit's gonna be redundant here.\n\n89\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.720\nThe database is based on\na few different options.\n\n90\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.210\nNow, if we kind of rifle\nit in scanning services.\n\n91\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.530\nAgain, it's gonna be really\nno different than any other,\n\n92\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.430\nany malware software that you have, right?\n\n93\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.980\nThe process is still gonna be the same.\n\n94\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.970\nWe've got that agent.\n\n95\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.470\nIt's gonna look for files and folders.\n\n96\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.540\nIt's gonna scour your hard drive.\n\n97\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.730\nWe've got USB devices that plug in, so you\nmight say hey, point it to the USB device.\n\n98\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.694\nIf I've got an external drive,\n\n99\n00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:36.186\nin fact I've got one connected\nto my computer right now,\n\n100\n00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:41.090\nI might want to verify that that external\nhard drive doesn't have a virus on it.\n\n101\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.570\nBut it's the database\nitself here that changes.\n\n102\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.430\nThis is what really\ndifferentiates heuristics-based\n\n103\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.960\nscanning from signature based scanning.\n\n104\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.180\nNow what we're saying is we\ndon't need a clear definition,\n\n105\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.000\nwe don't need a clear signal,\nor signature excuse me.\n\n106\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.640\nWhat we do need though are some rules.\n\n107\n00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.520\nSome rules that are built in, and\nthis is a expert analysis, right.\n\n108\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.730\nThe guys and gals that are putting this\nstuff together, I mean, they really\n\n109\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.940\nknow their stuff and what they do is\nthey look, they do sandboxing, right.\n\n110\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.500\nAnd what's the concept of sandboxing?\n\n111\n00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.420\nWell, if I can take,\nthink about virtualization out there guys\n\n112\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.290\nif you wanted to test\na virus you certainly, and\n\n113\n00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.310\nwe've been working on our network,\ndon't test viruses on your own network.\n\n114\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.190\nSo how do know how its going to react?\n\n115\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.640\nHow do you know what it's going to do?\n\n116\n00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.470\nWell you don't unless you put it in a\nvirtual machine you let it run its course\n\n117\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.490\nand now you can tell\nwhat it's going to do.\n\n118\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.780\nAnd from there we can make signatures on\nit but were talking about heuristic so\n\n119\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.360\nnow what we're talking about.\n\n120\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.240\nAre what are the rules, right?\n\n121\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.520\nA static set of rules that says, if it\nlooks like this, if you see this code,\n\n122\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.080\nif you think,\nnow this is where the weighing comes in.\n\n123\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.900\nI don't have a full answer, right?\n\n124\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.790\nBut I'm gonna weigh out the likelihood\n\n125\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.950\nthat this string of data that I\nsee Is gonna cause a problem.\n\n126\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.060\nAll right, what are the chances\nthat this might cause a problem.\n\n127\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.090\nSo notice that one of the things\nabout heuristics is it doesn't\n\n128\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.410\nhave a clear definition.\n\n129\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.540\nAnd I don't mean definition, pun intended,\n\n130\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.930\nit's the virus doesn't have\nto be clearly defined.\n\n131\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.960\nIt can say what do I have for rules?\n\n132\n00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.310\nIf it's doing this and\nit's pointing to this.\n\n133\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.720\nIf it has this code, and does that.\n\n134\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.520\nI'm gonna weigh all this out and\n\n135\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.780\ndetermine the likelihood\nthat this is a virus, right?\n\n136\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.580\nMaybe you've got missing code.\n\n137\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.800\nYou don't even have the same code.\n\n138\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.720\nYou've got pieces of code that\npartially identify as maybe being\n\n139\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.995\nthe characteristics of a virus, or\nthe code within a virus itself, but\n\n140\n00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:35.150\nyou don't have a full definition.\n\n141\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.400\nThe other thing that they like to do too,\nis do string searches.\n\n142\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.280\nA piece of code that's\ninside of the file itself.\n\n143\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.500\nLet's extract that out and\nwe'll use that as a way marker.\n\n144\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.400\nWe'll use that as the lighthouse\nthat says, if I see this and\n\n145\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.250\nI can see nothing else, chances are,\nI could flag it as a virus.\n\n146\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.140\nSo that's one of the interesting\nthings about this.\n\n147\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.057\nA lot of complexities behind it, and\nwith this kind of expert scanning, it,\n\n148\n00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:04.394\nI don't wanna say it goes through\na learning process if you will.\n\n149\n00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:09.050\nBecause the learning process is based\non what's in the database itself,\n\n150\n00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.986\nso what it does is it\nmakes a best guess effort.\n\n151\n00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:12.775\nThat's one of the things.\n\n152\n00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:15.596\nI don't really have all\nthe information that I need but\n\n153\n00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.810\nI think I have all that information.\n\n154\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.510\nAnd based on what I know now,\nbased on the policies, and the rules and\n\n155\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.410\nthe weighing the algorithms that I have,\nI'm gonna tell you that that's a virus.\n\n156\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.170\nAnd we're gonna take some kind of counter\nmeasure to ensure that it's quarantined\n\n157\n00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.230\nand then could eventually\nhopefully remediate our systems.\n\n158\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.690\n&gt;&gt; Now, if it's gonna be looking\nat pieces and parts and guessing.\n\n159\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.550\nI'm assuming there's a way that\nwe can say now that's okay.\n\n160\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's another thing.\n\n161\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.977\nThat's one of the, you know I'm kind\nof going to jump around you Mike.\n\n162\n00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:48.950\nPros and cons.\n\n163\n00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.110\nA lot of times we talk about the concepts\nand we come back to the pros and cons but.\n\n164\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.815\nWith that kind of question,\nit's a really good place to say, hey,\n\n165\n00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:57.700\nwell one of the benefits, right,\n\n166\n00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.445\nis that fact that New viruses that aren't\nidentified by signatures can potentially,\n\n167\n00:08:02.445 --> 00:08:05.700\ngotta be careful with that one,\nnever say always, right?\n\n168\n00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.960\nAnd never say never in security.\n\n169\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.550\nYou can potentially find viruses\nthat aren't clearly defined.\n\n170\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.434\nNow there's also a problem with that too,\nall right?\n\n171\n00:08:14.434 --> 00:08:17.913\nLike Mike says, what if I have a program,\nwhat if you have a line of business\n\n172\n00:08:17.913 --> 00:08:21.310\nsoftware that uses a certain\nfunctionality, right?\n\n173\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.710\nAnd for whatever reason, maybe\nthe reason's that portions of the stream\n\n174\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.090\nthat it's looking at kinda match in\nthat application that you're using.\n\n175\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.740\nThat brings us into what are known\nas false positives, all right.\n\n176\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.928\nAnd false positives is definitely one of\nthe drawbacks, there's other drawbacks,\n\n177\n00:08:37.928 --> 00:08:41.940\nbut that's one of the big drawbacks to\nheuristic scanning is because it's saying\n\n178\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.603\nI don't know if it's a duck,\nit's got webbed feet, it's got a bill, but\n\n179\n00:08:45.603 --> 00:08:48.251\nwait a second,\nis it a duckbill platypus, you know?\n\n180\n00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:53.960\nAnd so it thinks it's something it's not,\nand unfortunately that can happen, right?\n\n181\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.866\nA false positive is that we're\nquarantining, and even potentially\n\n182\n00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:02.646\nremoving, something that might be a system\nfile or maybe a dynamic link library file\n\n183\n00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:07.118\nor something like that an application is\nusing in part of its normal function.\n\n184\n00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:08.836\nSo that is a problem\nthat we have with these.\n\n185\n00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:13.804\nOne of the things that they\nalso use in order to identify.\n\n186\n00:09:13.804 --> 00:09:18.510\nWe still that database here that is\ngoing to try to identify portions of\n\n187\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.830\nwhat we do now.\n\n188\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.590\nSo how do they get to the information to\nsay hey, I see this portion of the code.\n\n189\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.180\nI see this portion of the code.\n\n190\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.852\nI don't have the whole picture, but\nI think it's going to be a virus.\n\n191\n00:09:28.852 --> 00:09:32.340\nWell, that's a process that\nwe could take a look at here.\n\n192\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.420\nOne of the things that they do is when\nthese viruses, Mike, when they're done,\n\n193\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.664\nright, they're ready to go and\nyou're ready to unleash them.\n\n194\n00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:42.944\nTypically, kind of like we talk about\nin other concepts like drivers,\n\n195\n00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:45.744\nthey're not in something\nthat's human readable, right.\n\n196\n00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:48.770\nComparative to a driver,\nright, what does a driver do?\n\n197\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.700\nIt allows our operating system that's in\na high level programming language that is\n\n198\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.608\nhuman readable to communicate with\nsomething that only works on machine code\n\n199\n00:09:55.608 --> 00:09:59.255\nand binary instructions, stuff that\nus humans can't read, especially Wes.\n\n200\n00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:00.986\n[LAUGH] So they decompile it.\n\n201\n00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:04.961\nThey take what they know as a virus and\nthey extract it and they remove it,\n\n202\n00:10:04.961 --> 00:10:08.610\nbasically bringing it back through\nthe layers out of that low level\n\n203\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.780\nmachine code back into something\nthat's a little bit more readable.\n\n204\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.428\nSomething that's,\nI would say human friendly, but\n\n205\n00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:17.006\nif you don't understand coding, which\nI don't, it's not even human friendly.\n\n206\n00:10:17.006 --> 00:10:19.634\n[LAUGH] But if you understand code,\nwhich they definitely do,\n\n207\n00:10:19.634 --> 00:10:21.916\nwhat they'll do is they'll take and\nthey'll look.\n\n208\n00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:24.015\nThey'll say okay,\nI've got a virus here, and\n\n209\n00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:26.125\nthis is just a portion of\nan example virus here.\n\n210\n00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:31.175\nI've got a portion of my virus, all right,\nand I've identified this string.\n\n211\n00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:33.064\nAnd when I identify this string,\n\n212\n00:10:33.064 --> 00:10:37.390\nI've identified a commonality in that\nwhole sandboxing process, right?\n\n213\n00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.194\nPut this in a virtual machine, see what it\ndoes so it doesn't affect your network.\n\n214\n00:10:40.194 --> 00:10:44.845\nAnd I've see that that code seems to\nbe consistent across maybe a couple of\n\n215\n00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:45.530\nviruses.\n\n216\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.119\nSo there's a uniqueness\nto just that string.\n\n217\n00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:51.710\nAnd then what they do is they say,\nyou know what, that's an abnormal string.\n\n218\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.040\nThat's gonna be something\nthat is malicious,\n\n219\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.560\nand it makes it's way into the database.\n\n220\n00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.116\nSo they don't just use a set of policies\nor rules and the weighing in options,\n\n221\n00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:05.807\nthey can actually look kind\nof like signatures do.\n\n222\n00:11:05.807 --> 00:11:09.064\nBut they're not looking\nat the signature itself,\n\n223\n00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:12.321\nthey're actually looking\nat the code this time and\n\n224\n00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:16.808\nsaying what inside of this code can\nI potentially identify as a virus?\n\n225\n00:11:16.808 --> 00:11:21.367\nSo really, if you think about it,\nI'm just amazed by it, honestly, Mike,\n\n226\n00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:26.000\nis how people thought about this out of\nelectrical impulses to make this type of\n\n227\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.983\nscanner, type of scanning agent, go into\nthese complexities of figuring it out and\n\n228\n00:11:30.983 --> 00:11:34.880\nsaying I'm not exactly sure, but\nhere's my best guess effort.\n\n229\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.199\nAnd hopefully I've solved your problem and\nI've quarantined that virus.\n\n230\n00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:39.054\nBut there again,\n\n231\n00:11:39.054 --> 00:11:42.873\nwe do run into that problem where maybe\nthat string wasn't a virus that it seen,\n\n232\n00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:46.258\nit kind of weighed in and maybe it had\nnothing to do with a string at all.\n\n233\n00:11:46.258 --> 00:11:49.020\nIt's saying okay,\nI'm using a little bit of my logic and\n\n234\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.430\nmy processing and it shuts down\none of those good processes, and\n\n235\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.640\nthat's where the white\nlisting process comes in.\n\n236\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.992\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\nSo this heuristics then sounds like it's\n\n237\n00:11:56.992 --> 00:12:00.973\na lot more complex, but there's definitely\nsome benefits to it because now all of\n\n238\n00:12:00.973 --> 00:12:04.862\na sudden I don't have to have something\nthat matches that definition exactly.\n\n239\n00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:09.414\nIt can look at parts of that code-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n240\n00:12:09.414 --> 00:12:10.517\n&gt;&gt; And match it.\n\n241\n00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:14.051\nSo if the bad guy's trying to take an\nexisting virus that he knows is gonna get\n\n242\n00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:16.383\nflagged and\nstopped before it makes it anywhere.\n\n243\n00:12:16.383 --> 00:12:19.899\nInstead of him being able to add a couple\nbytes of info to it and now get it\n\n244\n00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:24.029\nto go right by that signature definition,\nheuristics might be able to grab that.\n\n245\n00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.225\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it would be the case.\n\n246\n00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:27.548\nSo think about it.\n\n247\n00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:32.553\nThink about those viruses that they go\nthrough that metamorphosis process,\n\n248\n00:12:32.553 --> 00:12:33.940\nif you will, right.\n\n249\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.101\nIf I've got a static database that\nonly works on one string of data, or\n\n250\n00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:40.799\nactually one hashing value, let's be\ncareful with that one when it's not string\n\n251\n00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:43.226\nof data, but\nit's actually the fixed length value.\n\n252\n00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:47.150\nIf it changes, that value doesn't match.\n\n253\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.600\nBut if we're not using those static values\nanymore, one of the pros of this is this\n\n254\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:58.090\nkind of scanning software can make you\naware of otherwise unknown, undefined, and\n\n255\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:05.360\nsince undefined no matching signatures,\nviruses that we're not even aware of.\n\n256\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.550\nNow what I was gonna say,\n\n257\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:12.280\nthat's one of the biggest benefits is to\nbecome aware of something that nobody else\n\n258\n00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.500\nis aware of by weighing in those rules and\nthose checks and balances there, Mike.\n\n259\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.820\n&gt;&gt; Now probably,\nI'm guessing that a downside,\n\n260\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.478\nthis stuff just sounds really expensive,\nand there's probably no way I can get\n\n261\n00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:25.725\nsomething that does heuristics\non my client machine here.\n\n262\n00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:27.115\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would say no.\n\n263\n00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:29.150\n[LAUGH] You're wrong.\n\n264\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:34.300\nOne of the downsides to this really is\nthe computational power, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.160\nIt can be slower than signature based.\n\n266\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.330\nWhy?\nSignature based speeds up the process cuz\n\n267\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.970\nwe have our answers,\nwe don't have to calculate anything.\n\n268\n00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.680\nAll I have to do, the scanning service\nstill runs, but remember that's\n\n269\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.120\na commonality in all antivirus\nsoftware Is the scanning service.\n\n270\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.450\nDoesn't matter, pros or\ncons, you're gonna have one.\n\n271\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.720\nSo the scanning service says\nlet me just see what's here.\n\n272\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.275\nAnd let me reference that database,\n\n273\n00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:56.390\nbut I don't have to make\nany decisions past that.\n\n274\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.387\nHeuristics does have to\nmake those decisions.\n\n275\n00:13:58.387 --> 00:14:00.998\nIt has to use,\nthey use complex algorithms, and\n\n276\n00:14:00.998 --> 00:14:04.640\nI'm not even gonna pretend to know\nthese mathematical equations.\n\n277\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.888\nYou're probably them brilliant\nguys that drink too much coffee,\n\n278\n00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:11.957\nstay up way too late at night, and work\nout there at MIT, right, brilliant minds.\n\n279\n00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:15.489\nBut when it comes down to it, those\nheuristic algorithms, those weighing in,\n\n280\n00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.293\nthose checks and balances,\nthat takes computational power.\n\n281\n00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:20.801\nSo one of the drawbacks, Mike, here,\n\n282\n00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:23.998\nis that you could come to\nyour answer a lot slower.\n\n283\n00:14:23.998 --> 00:14:28.060\nSo the scans could take a lot longer,\nthey can, again,\n\n284\n00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.351\nthe other thing is with\nthe false positives.\n\n285\n00:14:31.351 --> 00:14:36.442\nBut I can show you right here, we actually\nhave, we've got a Windows 7 machine here.\n\n286\n00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:41.270\nAnd one of the things you had mentioned\nis probably going to be very expensive.\n\n287\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.160\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n288\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.677\nSecurity software can be very expensive,\nyou guys have probably seen that.\n\n289\n00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:49.939\nI mean it can be several\nthousands of dollars, but\n\n290\n00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:52.988\none of the good things is,\nwell, guess what?\n\n291\n00:14:52.988 --> 00:14:56.488\nAll right, that's great and it solves\nenterprises, but what about the, I don't\n\n292\n00:14:56.488 --> 00:15:00.344\nknow, 10 or 100 million other computers\nthat aren't in enterprise level networks?\n\n293\n00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:03.045\nIf we just let those get infected, right,\n\n294\n00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:06.300\nwhat infects one eventually\nwill affect all.\n\n295\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.340\nSo they do make this available\nto the customer for free.\n\n296\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.990\nAnd one of the things that Windows\nDefender has here, and we'll go ahead and\n\n297\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.820\nnavigate down here and I'll challenge\nmy abilities to type here real quick.\n\n298\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:21.388\nSo Windows Defender comes up, it does give\nyou the option to do a heuristic scanning.\n\n299\n00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:25.196\nAnd if we go to our tools and, I believe,\n\n300\n00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:30.738\noptions right here, and\nlet's see, default actions.\n\n301\n00:15:30.738 --> 00:15:32.526\nI believe it's under advanced,\nyeah, there it is.\n\n302\n00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:36.860\nSo you'll see right here,\nall right, use heuristics.\n\n303\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.563\nSo it's letting me know detect\nmalicious or unwanted software, right?\n\n304\n00:15:41.563 --> 00:15:44.964\nBut what is it telling me\nthat I'm doing here, right?\n\n305\n00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:49.532\nIt says without an existing definition,\nand that's the big thing.\n\n306\n00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:53.960\nWith a partially matched or\nwithout a fully existing definition, and\n\n307\n00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.461\nthat's one of the things that is very,\nvery good about heuristics, or\n\n308\n00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:00.727\njust Windows defender in general.\n\n309\n00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:03.212\nThe fact that I can get this protection.\n\n310\n00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.436\nBut at the same time,\n\n311\n00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:08.317\nI don't have to spend a lot of money\nin order to get that protection.\n\n312\n00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:11.962\nNow one of the things that we also have to\nkeep in mind is that if you do wanna pay,\n\n313\n00:16:11.962 --> 00:16:15.363\nsometimes when you pay money,\nyou get a little bit more functionality.\n\n314\n00:16:15.363 --> 00:16:17.938\nDepending on what you pay,\nyou get a little more flair with it.\n\n315\n00:16:17.938 --> 00:16:21.054\nAnd I don't wanna just say flair and bells\nand whistles, but more functionality,\n\n316\n00:16:21.054 --> 00:16:22.045\nmore advanced features.\n\n317\n00:16:22.045 --> 00:16:25.213\nThey do have one here,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n318\n00:16:25.213 --> 00:16:27.700\njust start the installer on this one.\n\n319\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.928\nThis is ESET Live installer\nthat's going on here, and\n\n320\n00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:33.603\nyou can see the NOD32 antivirus software.\n\n321\n00:16:33.603 --> 00:16:36.436\nBut, one of the things that I want to\nshow you here is that they also warn you\n\n322\n00:16:36.436 --> 00:16:37.000\ntoo, right?\n\n323\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.985\nAs Mike and I are talking,\none of the drawbacks is false positives.\n\n324\n00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:43.487\nWell, false positives could potentially\ncripple your network, right.\n\n325\n00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:44.833\nIf you've got an email.\n\n326\n00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:46.552\nLet's say, this is on a server, right.\n\n327\n00:16:46.552 --> 00:16:48.681\nIf it's on a server,\nand it false positive,\n\n328\n00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:52.168\nsomething that has to do with your\nemail exchange or your email protocol.\n\n329\n00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:54.538\nWell, now your business shuts down, right?\n\n330\n00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:58.537\nWell, maybe not in reality, but\nit definitely can hinder productivity, so\n\n331\n00:16:58.537 --> 00:17:00.637\nthey warn you sometimes about Uristix.\n\n332\n00:17:00.637 --> 00:17:01.635\nAnd let me show you this.\n\n333\n00:17:01.635 --> 00:17:05.592\nSee it go through the download\nprocess here, and when we go to ask,\n\n334\n00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:08.361\ndo we want to add that\nUristix functionality?\n\n335\n00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.309\nIt's opted into it, right?\n\n336\n00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:14.675\nIt's gonna say, Hey,\ndo you want to do this?\n\n337\n00:17:14.675 --> 00:17:19.851\nBecause by doing this,\nnot only do you have the potential for\n\n338\n00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:22.084\nfinding new viruses, but\n\n339\n00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:27.686\nyou also have the potential to\ncripple stuff that isn't a virus.\n\n340\n00:17:27.686 --> 00:17:32.318\nAnd when you have, as we probably know,\nsoftware has many dependencies.\n\n341\n00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:36.440\nYou have different pieces of code probably\ncalling on all different links across\n\n342\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.236\nthe operating system and\nanyone of those components.\n\n343\n00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:43.987\nUristix says well, I'm not really sure,\nbut looking at some code here.\n\n344\n00:17:43.987 --> 00:17:48.043\nI'm weighing in the possibilities,\nI'm going back to those\n\n345\n00:17:48.043 --> 00:17:52.879\nrules in the rule book, and its telling\nme that there's a 99% chance or\n\n346\n00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:56.006\na 90% chance that this\nis going to be a virus.\n\n347\n00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:59.066\nDo I, and it blocks it and\nit cripples the program.\n\n348\n00:17:59.066 --> 00:18:00.414\nSo yeah, there we go.\n\n349\n00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:03.325\nSo notice that right here, all right,\n\n350\n00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:08.546\nit says can detect from potentially\nunwanted applications, right.\n\n351\n00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.708\nPotentially.\n\n352\n00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:12.703\nIt doesn't say established.\n\n353\n00:18:12.703 --> 00:18:16.213\nWhen you go to a website, like for\ninstance, a lot of the major browsers.\n\n354\n00:18:16.213 --> 00:18:19.337\nI know Microsoft keeps what's known as\na reputation database that works in\n\n355\n00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:23.072\ncombinations with the smart screen filter\nthat's built into Internet Explorer right?\n\n356\n00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:24.256\nBut what does that mean?\n\n357\n00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:29.172\nIt's known URLs for propagating spam,\nfor propagating malware.\n\n358\n00:18:29.172 --> 00:18:30.471\nIt's already been established.\n\n359\n00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:32.027\nSo it's not potential.\n\n360\n00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:33.026\nWe know about it.\n\n361\n00:18:33.026 --> 00:18:40.293\nHere it's telling you it might be a virus,\nbut again, understand it can.\n\n362\n00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:42.336\nAnd here's the big thing here.\n\n363\n00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:43.660\nNotice what it says there, Mike.\n\n364\n00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.353\nIt says,\ncan affect computer performance, right?\n\n365\n00:18:46.353 --> 00:18:47.899\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's gonna have to weigh\n\n366\n00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:49.441\nin on this, a lot of CPU strength.\n\n367\n00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:53.828\nAnytime you gotta compute something,\nyou gotta make a guess, right?\n\n368\n00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:58.285\nYou run the risk of reducing\nthe performance in general.\n\n369\n00:18:58.285 --> 00:19:02.159\nBut the other thing that you\nalso have to see it says,\n\n370\n00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:05.342\ncan reliability and changes in behavior.\n\n371\n00:19:05.342 --> 00:19:09.600\nSo [LAUGH] while this does sound like hey\nthis is a great thing, we need to use it.\n\n372\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.087\nI would recommend using it.\n\n373\n00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:13.593\nBut I would be ready for the fallout.\n\n374\n00:19:13.593 --> 00:19:16.101\n[LAUGH] I would be ready for\nthe contingency plan.\n\n375\n00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:20.655\nRemember one of the things you always have\nto keep in mind with Uristix based is\n\n376\n00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:22.138\nthose false positives.\n\n377\n00:19:22.138 --> 00:19:23.880\nSo what if I do find a false positive?\n\n378\n00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.902\nWhat do I do with it?\n\n379\n00:19:24.902 --> 00:19:27.223\nDo I just let it break my network?\n\n380\n00:19:27.223 --> 00:19:28.663\n&gt;&gt; Cry.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n381\n00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:29.916\nWe'll go home for the day, right?\n\n382\n00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:31.280\nWe cannot do that.\n\n383\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.704\nSo one of the other things that you do\nin Uristix is you do what is known as\n\n384\n00:19:34.704 --> 00:19:35.527\nwhitelisting.\n\n385\n00:19:35.527 --> 00:19:39.804\nAll right, see Uristix you\nwouldn't force a block right away.\n\n386\n00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:44.873\nWhether it's a good program, benign,\nor whether it's a malicious program.\n\n387\n00:19:44.873 --> 00:19:47.506\nUristix starts in\nenforcement mode right away.\n\n388\n00:19:47.506 --> 00:19:53.498\nIt says block everything or\nblock what we think is a virus,\n\n389\n00:19:53.498 --> 00:19:57.181\nand then It doesn't really learn.\n\n390\n00:19:57.181 --> 00:20:01.301\nIt'll block something and you'll say well\nwait a second that's affecting my email.\n\n391\n00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.558\nMy users can no longer use their email.\n\n392\n00:20:03.558 --> 00:20:04.323\nSo what do you do?\n\n393\n00:20:04.323 --> 00:20:05.508\nYou put that in a list.\n\n394\n00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:08.109\nIt's a lot like the concept\nin wireless computer.\n\n395\n00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:09.594\nWe talk about Mac filters, right.\n\n396\n00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:12.706\nI want to allow somebody if\nthey have this Mac address.\n\n397\n00:20:12.706 --> 00:20:16.515\nWell with the white listing what your\ndoing here is your saying this is a good\n\n398\n00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.667\nprogram, all right.\n\n399\n00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:22.688\nI'm telling you anti-virus software the\nnext time you come across this process or\n\n400\n00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.490\nthis file, don't block it.\n\n401\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.924\nAll right, and then the next\ntime the email runs there Mike,\n\n402\n00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:29.935\nwhat we end up getting is well hopefully\nthe application starts working and\n\n403\n00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:32.181\npeople get their emails and\nthey're not calling you for\n\n404\n00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:34.658\nsupport tickets saying Mike,\ncan you fix the email server.\n\n405\n00:20:34.658 --> 00:20:35.796\nYou’ve broke the internet.\n\n406\n00:20:35.796 --> 00:20:39.859\n&gt;&gt; It sounds a lot like our\njunk mail filters right.\n\n407\n00:20:39.859 --> 00:20:42.992\nEvery once in a while we have\nto go through our junk mail and\n\n408\n00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.539\nwe're gonna find some\nthings in there that got\n\n409\n00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:49.811\nflagged as junk because of keywords that\nare found in the subject or the body.\n\n410\n00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:52.941\nAnd we can go in there,\nwe can so no Windows or Outlook,\n\n411\n00:20:52.941 --> 00:20:55.470\nthat is not junk mail and\nit'll put it back.\n\n412\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.514\nSo that's basically the same thing\nhere with these false positives.\n\n413\n00:20:58.514 --> 00:21:02.599\nIt's seeing behavior or bits of code\nthat it thinks could be a virus and\n\n414\n00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:05.661\nto be safe rather than sorry,\nit's gonna block it.\n\n415\n00:21:05.661 --> 00:21:09.870\nAnd then we've gotta go back in there and\nslowly take those things that it's\n\n416\n00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.815\nblocked, determine whether it's good or\nbad, and if they were good,\n\n417\n00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:17.801\nput them on a white list so that it\nlearns to not block them in the future.\n\n418\n00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:18.962\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what you're doing.\n\n419\n00:21:18.962 --> 00:21:20.494\nYou're telling it do not block this.\n\n420\n00:21:20.494 --> 00:21:23.414\nAnd that's one of the things that\ndifferentiates a little bit from\n\n421\n00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:25.126\nbehavior-based scanning, right?\n\n422\n00:21:25.126 --> 00:21:28.347\nBehavior-based performance on actions,\nright?\n\n423\n00:21:28.347 --> 00:21:30.575\nIt's based on what is the functionality.\n\n424\n00:21:30.575 --> 00:21:33.311\nAnd we'll talk about that one here\ncoming up in another episode.\n\n425\n00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:36.186\nBut what I want you to understand\nis that with behavior based,\n\n426\n00:21:36.186 --> 00:21:38.135\nyou don't enforce anything right away.\n\n427\n00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:40.457\nIt does truly learn.\n\n428\n00:21:40.457 --> 00:21:43.961\nUristix isn't really learning,\nit isn't learning something.\n\n429\n00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:45.887\nIt's using checks and balances.\n\n430\n00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:49.730\nIt's using algorithms,\nit's using string searches.\n\n431\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.198\nSo it is stuff that is built into it and\n\n432\n00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:55.793\nthen it calculates it based\non what it already knows.\n\n433\n00:21:55.793 --> 00:21:57.824\nAnd then based on what it already knows,\n\n434\n00:21:57.824 --> 00:22:00.112\nit makes a decision on\nwhat it doesn't know.\n\n435\n00:22:00.112 --> 00:22:03.673\nSo, it's a little bit different there,\nbut very complex.\n\n436\n00:22:03.673 --> 00:22:07.873\nAnd I can tell you if you do introduce\nUristix, don't stay away from it.\n\n437\n00:22:07.873 --> 00:22:10.286\nBy all means,\nyou don't need to stay away from it.\n\n438\n00:22:10.286 --> 00:22:13.437\nAnd just understand that\nthe benefit's early detection.\n\n439\n00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:14.808\nThat’s gotta be one of the best benefits.\n\n440\n00:22:14.808 --> 00:22:16.804\nWe don't have to wait until somebody,\n\n441\n00:22:16.804 --> 00:22:20.793\nlike one of our major security\nmanufacturers out there whether it be\n\n442\n00:22:20.793 --> 00:22:24.613\nTrenton, Microsystem, Norton,\nWindows Defender in Microsoft there.\n\n443\n00:22:24.613 --> 00:22:30.477\nWe don't have to wait for them to reverse\nengineer the virus, give us a definition,\n\n444\n00:22:30.477 --> 00:22:34.789\npropagate it to the world, or\nmaybe to their end users right.\n\n445\n00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:36.090\nWe can make a decision now.\n\n446\n00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.121\nWe don't have to wait on the vendors\nto update, we make a decision now.\n\n447\n00:22:39.121 --> 00:22:41.572\nHopefully it solves our problem,\nbut then again,\n\n448\n00:22:41.572 --> 00:22:45.620\njust remember one of the drawbacks is the\nfalse positive and the computational power\n\n449\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.710\nthat it takes to scan these files and\nfind those viruses, Mike.\n\n450\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.868\n&gt;&gt; That is a big advantage there.\n\n451\n00:22:50.868 --> 00:22:54.964\nThat early detection, because normally\nif we think about signature based, how\n\n452\n00:22:54.964 --> 00:22:59.380\nlong is it between them detecting a virus,\nand us getting protection from that virus?\n\n453\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.726\nYou figure,\nlet's say a company gets infected.\n\n454\n00:23:01.726 --> 00:23:03.838\nNobody’s ever seen this virus before.\n\n455\n00:23:03.838 --> 00:23:08.283\nThey’re got to box that machine up, send\nit off to one of these MacAffee, Semantic,\n\n456\n00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:09.098\nwhat have you.\n\n457\n00:23:09.098 --> 00:23:11.466\nThey’ve got to analyze,\nreverse engineer it.\n\n458\n00:23:11.466 --> 00:23:14.271\nDo what they've got to do to\ncome up with a definition and\n\n459\n00:23:14.271 --> 00:23:17.688\neventually just shoot it out to\nthe masses and the rest of the world.\n\n460\n00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:18.477\nIn the meantime,\n\n461\n00:23:18.477 --> 00:23:21.850\nI've been vulnerable to that the whole\ntime that process has been going on.\n\n462\n00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.676\nThat can be, I don't know how long it\ntakes a vendor to go through something\n\n463\n00:23:25.676 --> 00:23:27.580\nlike that, days, weeks, a month.\n\n464\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.996\nWhereas if I'm running Uristix, I might\nbe able to snag it even though there's no\n\n465\n00:23:31.996 --> 00:23:35.132\ndefinition yet just because it\ncan see this odd behavior or\n\n466\n00:23:35.132 --> 00:23:38.470\nthis bit of code that is probably\na virus or probably malware.\n\n467\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:44.044\nSo that's a big advantage of Uristix is\nthat the ability to detect things as you\n\n468\n00:23:44.044 --> 00:23:49.378\nsaid before there's a formal definition\nand my signature base can get it.\n\n469\n00:23:49.378 --> 00:23:50.933\n&gt;&gt; In fact Mike and\nI were doing a show and\n\n470\n00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:54.156\none of our viewers got in the chatroom and\nmade a very, very good statement.\n\n471\n00:23:54.156 --> 00:23:59.144\nNow, I don't have actual statistics here,\nbut a very good statement that said he was\n\n472\n00:23:59.144 --> 00:24:03.097\nreading something that says\nthere's 350,000 Potential,\n\n473\n00:24:03.097 --> 00:24:06.030\npotential viruses that\nare learned of each week.\n\n474\n00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n475\n00:24:07.325 --> 00:24:08.200\n&gt;&gt; 350,000 each week, potential.\n\n476\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.360\nWell, what if you wanna know, right?\n\n477\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.764\nLike Mike said, I don't wanna wait for\nthe potential, I don't wanna wait for\n\n478\n00:24:12.764 --> 00:24:14.480\nthe fact that they're gonna learn it.\n\n479\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.670\nThey're gonna reverse engineer it.\n\n480\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.830\nThey're gonna take the time, get that\ndefinition and then we gotta wait for\n\n481\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.380\nit to be distributed.\n\n482\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.360\nNo, I want my decision now\neven if it's a bad decision.\n\n483\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.320\nWhich a bad decision is just\nto block it when it's not bad.\n\n484\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.440\nAlso keep in mind a couple of things,\nI've mentioned false positives.\n\n485\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.547\nThere's also false negatives, okay.\n\n486\n00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:35.560\nIt's almost something\nthat you have to mention.\n\n487\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.350\nIf you're going to mention a false\npositive somebody is going to say well is\n\n488\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.290\nthere a false negative?\n\n489\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.370\nIt's the other side of the tracks here,\nit can be just as bad.\n\n490\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.510\nAll right, to me I would rather\nhave a false positive than a false\n\n491\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.290\nnegative, right?\n\n492\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.860\nBecause a false positive,\nI can go in there, and I can white list.\n\n493\n00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.080\nI can say, hey,\nI don't want you to get rid of this.\n\n494\n00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.730\nAnd I don't want you to quarantine it.\n\n495\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.520\nI don't want you to stop\nit's functionality.\n\n496\n00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.270\nI put it in a list, I'm good.\n\n497\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.350\nBut what if your scanner has the blinders\non and says, yeah that's good,\n\n498\n00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.150\nlet them on through, or let it on through.\n\n499\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.970\nAnd then you find out\nthat some kind of trojan,\n\n500\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.100\nsome kind of back door virus,\nsome kind of worm.\n\n501\n00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.460\nNow you've got it spread\nout through your entire\n\n502\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.730\nnetwork because your software was\nsaying it's okay when it really wasn't.\n\n503\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:19.600\nSo I do want to mention that there just\nas much going along with false positives,\n\n504\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.240\nall the false negatives.\n\n505\n00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.850\nAnd when it comes down to it, false\npositives from my perspective are a little\n\n506\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.980\nbit better than false negatives,\nby you might say completely opposite.\n\n507\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.930\nYou might say well hey,\nthey're both just as bad because hey,\n\n508\n00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.840\nI've got three false positives last\nweek and it broke down my network.\n\n509\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.570\nIt was a major critical piece of\nsoftware that an application used\n\n510\n00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.160\nline of business and\nit brings down the network.\n\n511\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.290\nWell, to you that would be no\ndifferent than a false negative,\n\n512\n00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.270\nrunning the risk of causing problems.\n\n513\n00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.430\nSo just be aware of that too.\n\n514\n00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.780\nFalse positives and false negatives,\nreally what we're talking about here is\n\n515\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.040\nfalse positives as being some\nof the drawbacks to heuristics.\n\n516\n00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.310\nBut one of the things I want you\nto remember, keep the scans on,\n\n517\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.120\nwhatever you're using.\n\n518\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.310\nAnd if it gives you the option like\nWindows Defender here does, like the one\n\n519\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.850\nthat we see here, as well as you install\nit, go ahead and take advantage of it.\n\n520\n00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:10.250\nJust weigh the consequences and\nknow how to remediate the consequences so\n\n521\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.370\nthat your system stays secure but at the\nsame time it doesn't break your network,\n\n522\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.622\nso secure even I can't get anything done.\n\n523\n00:26:16.622 --> 00:26:17.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm with you.\n\n524\n00:26:17.697 --> 00:26:20.750\nA false positives are a lot\nbetter than that false negative.\n\n525\n00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.450\nFalse positive I could say,\nall right it caught it, it wasn't really.\n\n526\n00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.700\nWe can white list it as you said and\nallow it.\n\n527\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.999\nAnd maybe we were stuck for a little bit,\nwhereas that false negative,\n\n528\n00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:33.160\nthat means it didn't do anything.\n\n529\n00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.790\nIt said, it's okay, and let it in.\n\n530\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.270\nAnd whatever the damage from that malware.\n\n531\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.538\nThat's when the expense is data is stolen,\ncustomer information is compromised,\n\n532\n00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:45.860\ndrives are formatted,\nwhatever the payload is on that malware.\n\n533\n00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.112\nAny day I'll take a false\npositive over a false negative.\n\n534\n00:26:50.112 --> 00:26:50.631\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n535\n00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:53.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And maybe from a smaller work group\n\n536\n00:26:53.042 --> 00:26:57.367\nenvironment you might say that\nI'll take the false negative.\n\n537\n00:26:57.367 --> 00:26:58.770\nBut you gotta think about something.\n\n538\n00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.132\nIf you have a centralized\nmanagement system and\n\n539\n00:27:01.132 --> 00:27:03.620\nwe're not doing this client\nto client to client.\n\n540\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.288\nIf it's a false negative on one computer,\nall right,\n\n541\n00:27:06.288 --> 00:27:08.950\nthat might spread into\na couple of other computers.\n\n542\n00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.380\nBut if that is a centralized management\nsystem that's being deployed out to all\n\n543\n00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.205\nof your endpoints, your computers, your\nservers, and your mobile devices as well,\n\n544\n00:27:18.205 --> 00:27:21.470\nand now it's in that database that says,\nno this is good.\n\n545\n00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.642\nSo, we'll go ahead and just distribute\nit to thousands of people or\n\n546\n00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:25.880\nhundreds of devices.\n\n547\n00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.740\nIt doesn't have to be thousands, but\n\n548\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.840\nthat could cause a nightmare in the whole\nentire corporate network, so I do agree.\n\n549\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.540\nYes, sir.\n\n550\n00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.420\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n551\n00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.418\nAll right, Wes, well, a lot of great\ninformation there on anti virus, anti\n\n552\n00:27:37.418 --> 00:27:42.110\nmalware, and specifically heuristics, and\nhow those differ from our signature based.\n\n553\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.965\nAnd I know we've got one\nmore type to go over,\n\n554\n00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:48.210\nbut that's gonna have to\ncome in another episode.\n\n555\n00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.430\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n556\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n557\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:57.560\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n558\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.830\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.020\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.410\ntoday we're going to be diving into\nthe world of anti virus, anti malware, and\n\n5\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.420\nspecifically we're going to be\nlooking at behavior based antivirus.\n\n6\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.340\nSo far in past episode we've looked\nat signature based antivirus,\n\n7\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.210\nwe've looked at heuristic based antivirus.\n\n8\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.880\nNow we're going to take a look at\nthe third option which is going to\n\n9\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.050\nbe behavior based.\n\n10\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.480\nAnd with us today to help us wade through\nthis myriad of antivirus solutions.\n\n11\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.670\nNone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.410\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n13\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.090\n>> Man, it's going good.\n\n14\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.100\nIt's good to be here guys.\n\n15\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.060\nGreat to see you guys out there,\nor maybe not see you.\n\n16\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.650\nBut I'm glad you guys\nare visiting us today.\n\n17\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.940\nAnd that's right, we're gonna get into\nsome more of the scanning process.\n\n18\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.180\nSo scanning types, if you will,\ninside of antivirus.\n\n19\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.520\nKeep in mind, one of the things that is\na commonality among all antivirus types,\n\n20\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.830\nregardless of the scanning method,\n\n21\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.370\nis the fact that we have to have some kind\nof scanning service and that we also,\n\n22\n00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.400\nnot only to go along with that scanning\nservice, we have some kind of database.\n\n23\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.800\nNow, how the database is populated and how\nin the criteria that are stored in that\n\n24\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.910\ndatabase, is really one of\nthe major things that, I said,\n\n25\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.510\nmain things that differentiate\nthose different scanning types.\n\n26\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.820\nNow so far with signatures we've been\ntalking about signature based and\n\n27\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.332\nwe said that that is a static database of\nhash values and one of the problems here\n\n28\n00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:32.600\nis that if your antivirus software,\nnot antivirus but the viruses themselves,\n\n29\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.570\nif they change their code, hashes don't\nmatch, they slip under the radar.\n\n30\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.150\nHeuristics, another one there.\n\n31\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.210\nHeuristics is one that it also looks for\n\n32\n00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.630\na certain set of rules and\nweighs the likelihood and\n\n33\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.000\nit's still looking at string data as well,\nso it's still looking at the code.\n\n34\n00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.440\nIn both of those types,\nwe're looking at code.\n\n35\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.680\nNow, this is one of the ones that\nwe aren't really looking at code.\n\n36\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.810\nNow we're doing something\na little bit different.\n\n37\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.620\nWhat we're looking at now is actions.\n\n38\n00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.940\nSo if we look at it here,\n\n39\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.110\nagain it's gonna be no different than some\nof the other types that we've seeing.\n\n40\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.700\nWe've got a database over here.\n\n41\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.980\nWe've got a scanning service.\n\n42\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.170\nAnd it's monitoring different locations\nthroughout your computer, your folders,\n\n43\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.040\nyour files.\n\n44\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.360\nYou know, the folder hierarchy,\n\n45\n00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.610\nyour system files,\nanywhere on the hard drive itself.\n\n46\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.002\nIt monitors things like, for instance,\nif you're plugging in USB devices,\n\n47\n00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.473\nwe know how there's a potential\nsecurity problem with that.\n\n48\n00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:34.579\nNow, what happens if you,\nlet's say, plug in a USB device?\n\n49\n00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.799\nWe sometimes warn about\nthings like auto-play.\n\n50\n00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.073\nAuto-play instantly asks you to respond,\n\n51\n00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:43.530\nasks you to do something\nwith this USB device.\n\n52\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.790\nDo you wanna view the files on it?\n\n53\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.130\nBut what if you've set it to\nalways open up the files.\n\n54\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.290\nAnd maybe you've forgot about it.\n\n55\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.980\nI've done it before.\n\n56\n00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.610\nI've set auto-play and\nI meant to say take no action.\n\n57\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.186\nBut I accidentally clicked, maybe I\nwas in a hurry that day, said view and\n\n58\n00:02:57.186 --> 00:03:01.450\nopen folders, and view the files and\nfolders in it becomes the default.\n\n59\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.310\nNow, the next time I plug in that\nmalicious USB device, right?\n\n60\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.030\nIt's got a boot loader in it.\n\n61\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.490\nA boot loader virus.\n\n62\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.170\nAnd, it instantly goes into action.\n\n63\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.950\nWell, here's the problem with that.\n\n64\n00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.800\nIt's already acting and if our computers\ndon't get to it quick enough, if we\n\n65\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.390\ndon't have a definition in that database,\nif we don't have a logic applied to it in\n\n66\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.620\nthe case of heuristics, the action that\nthat's performing goes unnoticed and\n\n67\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.240\nnow the virus is in our systems and\nit's causing problems.\n\n68\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.080\nSo keep in mind that\nwith the behavior based,\n\n69\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.100\nwe're looking at something\njust a little bit different.\n\n70\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.320\nWe're looking at the actions here, right?\n\n71\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.010\nIt's scanning actions against a database.\n\n72\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.450\nYou might ask yourself,\nwait a second, if it is a database,\n\n73\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.290\nhow do we know the actions in\nthat database are valid actions?\n\n74\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.020\nAnd that is one of the things we are going\nto talk about a little bit more,\n\n75\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.920\nis how you populate the database.\n\n76\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.900\nThis is another, Mike, form if you will,\nanother type of dynamic database\n\n77\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.470\nthat is going to be populated, it's\ngonna add some volume over the course,\n\n78\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.050\nthe lifecycle, of that security product,\nas you use it more and more.\n\n79\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.270\n>> So instead of looking at\na definition of either an actual\n\n80\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.480\nvirus where we've got a hash value, or\na definition like a part of a code or\n\n81\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.260\nsomething like that, now it's all based\non what the thing is doing on my machine.\n\n82\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.385\nAnd I can see this unusual behavior or\n\n83\n00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:24.360\nout-of-norm behaviour,\nand that can be flagged.\n\n84\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.650\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n85\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.680\nIf you think about it,\nup until now, you know,\n\n86\n00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.880\nwhat we've been talking\nabout is based on the code.\n\n87\n00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.140\nLike I said, heuristics, let's be honest\nhere, yeah it's based in some part\n\n88\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.570\non the code, but there's many\ndifferent types of heuristic base.\n\n89\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.720\nWe just talk about some\nof the common ones here.\n\n90\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.900\nBut it's still looking\nat identifiable strings.\n\n91\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.330\nSome portion of identifiable\nstrings in the code itself.\n\n92\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.840\nNow what we're saying is,\nI don't care what the code is.\n\n93\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.210\nNow I wanna see what are the processes\nthat are being performed?\n\n94\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.120\nWhat are the actions\nthat are being performed?\n\n95\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.910\nWhat is running on the machine?\n\n96\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.920\nAnd that can potentially help us,\nwhere maybe signatures, right?\n\n97\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.310\nYou've got a polymorphic virus,\nthe code changes.\n\n98\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.410\nHeuristics might catch it.\n\n99\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.190\nBut the problem is there, what if your\nheuristics scanning doesn't catch it?\n\n100\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.170\nIt's not a failsafe.\n\n101\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.030\nWell, one of the things with behavior,\n\n102\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.490\nif we're not really worried about the code\nand we're looking at the actions.\n\n103\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.890\nWe're looking at a different\nfocus when it comes to the virus,\n\n104\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.530\nthen potentially, we might be\nable to identify early viruses.\n\n105\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.290\nMaybe not quite as efficient as\nearly viruses as heuristics,\n\n106\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.740\nbut at least we can identify the common\nsigns, the symptoms of a virus.\n\n107\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.300\nSo even though the code doesn't match,\nif they perform the same functionality,\n\n108\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.130\nI don't care about that, cuz the code\nisn't what's being inspected, so\n\n109\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.160\nyou can code it any way you want\nif the functionality is the same.\n\n110\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.850\nThe function of the process\nthat it performs.\n\n111\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.370\nNow we can identify it.\n\n112\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.090\nNow one of the drawbacks to that,\nMike, if you think about it, right?\n\n113\n00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.710\nI'm going to identify\na process that's in action.\n\n114\n00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.440\nNow, there is a drawback to that.\n\n115\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.180\nWhen you think about what\nthat drawback might be?\n\n116\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.580\n>> I would imagine we're gonna get into\nthe world of false positives here.\n\n117\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.090\n>> Yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.230\nAnd think about it this way, right?\n\n119\n00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:12.590\nWhen you do signature-based scanning,\nyou're being more proactive, right?\n\n120\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.830\nThe virus itself doesn't have to run, it\njust has to make its way onto your system.\n\n121\n00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.360\nSee, that's one of the drawbacks\nto behavior-based is the fact that\n\n122\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.530\nthe actions are already being performed.\n\n123\n00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.730\nSo if you think about it, yes,\nabsolutely false positives.\n\n124\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.400\nAnd we'll get into that.\n\n125\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.530\nThis is another one, just like heuristics,\nthat can generate false positives.\n\n126\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.130\nMost definitely.\n\n127\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.940\nAnd we know.\n\n128\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.980\nWe'll establish a little bit more, if\nyou haven't watched that episode before,\n\n129\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.420\ngo back and watch it, but\nwe'll also talk about it here.\n\n130\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.140\nThe fact that the action has to\nalready in place, all right.\n\n131\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.630\nSo behavior based, we have to be\ncareful with it because it's gonna be\n\n132\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.740\nreactive to a potential attack\nthat might already be in place.\n\n133\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.350\nSo how are we gonna define\nwhat actions can happen or\n\n134\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.610\nare supposed to happen I should say,\ncuz any action really can happen.\n\n135\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.335\nIt's whether it's supposed to happen or\nnot.\n\n136\n00:06:57.335 --> 00:06:59.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have to figure out what process?\n\n137\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.470\nNow, I'm just kinda\nlumping these together.\n\n138\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.330\nProcess, action.\n\n139\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.570\nI'm kinda using them synonymously here.\n\n140\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.950\nIf you got a service that runs in the\nbackground that is dependent on something.\n\n141\n00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.760\nIf you have a dynamic link library\nfile that's calling on additional\n\n142\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.160\nfunctionalities in an application,\n\n143\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.100\nthese are all processes that\nare running in the background.\n\n144\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.850\nSo we have to figure out how\nwe generate the database.\n\n145\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.380\nAnd one of the things that\nwe can check out here is\n\n146\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.150\nit goes through something\nknown as the learning process.\n\n147\n00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.790\nThe learning process is that, remember,\nit still has a scanning service.\n\n148\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.560\nThat's one of the commonalities,\nthat's one of the staple features in\n\n149\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.730\nany antivirus software is that\nit has a scanning service.\n\n150\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.420\nSo now the scanning service\nisn't trying to block anything.\n\n151\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.320\nWhen it goes to the learning process, we\ndon't have to worry about false positives\n\n152\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.340\nat this time because it doesn't\nknow what a false positive is.\n\n153\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.720\nOf course, it really doesn't\neven know what a positive is.\n\n154\n00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.110\nEven if it's false or not.\n\n155\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.160\nSo it goes through a process of scanning.\n\n156\n00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.740\nIt could be a couple weeks there.\n\n157\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.210\nWe could use this for a couple of weeks.\n\n158\n00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.277\nAgain if you think about that, Mike.\n\n159\n00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:58.739\nThe action is already in place.\n\n160\n00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:01.852\nSo If I've gotta go through a learning\nprocess for a couple of weeks.\n\n161\n00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:04.190\nI would see that there\nprobably would be a potential.\n\n162\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.208\nWhen I first put this in place,\nour networks could be full of viruses and\n\n163\n00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:08.600\nwe're not aware of it yet.\n\n164\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.590\n>> Right, absolutely.\n\n165\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.650\nBut it is gonna give that software\na chance to see what normal behavior is.\n\n166\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.570\nWe're gonna have to kind of assume that\neverything that's going on is expected.\n\n167\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.370\nIt's gonna learn that and then from\nthen on out, that's when we tell it,\n\n168\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.740\nokay, anything beyond what\nyou've scanned already,\n\n169\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.940\nwhich you've already learned,\nwe're gonna flag that?\n\n170\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.870\n>> Yeah, so think about it,\n\n171\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.780\nwe talk a lot about a security content\ncalled an implicit deny, right,\n\n172\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.710\nanything that's not expressly allowed,\nobviously is denied,\n\n173\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.930\nright, that's implicitly deny, this is\nalmost like an explicit allow, right?\n\n174\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.970\nAllow everything, we're not gonna\nblock anything, just allow everything.\n\n175\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.840\nAnd then what you're\nscanner's gonna go through,\n\n176\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.917\nis it's gonna go through the process\nof saying hey, is this a valid process?\n\n177\n00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:48.510\nRight, you're accessing a file that's\ncalling down into the registry or\n\n178\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.130\nthe application is calling down and\nmaking a registry write or\n\n179\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.880\nit's calling down to that dynamic link\nlibrary, calling on another dependency.\n\n180\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.890\nSo it goes through.\n\n181\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.400\nWe've got process one, two, and\nthree here and it says, is this normal?\n\n182\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.950\nWell, I don't know if it's normal.\n\n183\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.350\nI have to determine that.\n\n184\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.900\nSo what it does is it views all of\nthe processes that are going on right now.\n\n185\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.890\nAnd it stores all of them in the database,\neverything.\n\n186\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.510\nAnd it does that for\na short period of time.\n\n187\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.480\nNow, I say, a short period of time.\n\n188\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.820\nIt's really contingent on the software,\nitself.\n\n189\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.650\nIt could be a couple of days,\n\n190\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.660\nif you're just talking maybe\nabout a host based solution.\n\n191\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.240\nIf you're talking about\na network based solution,\n\n192\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.260\nthere's a lot more traffic going on.\n\n193\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.040\nA lot more processes, a lot of protocols\ngoing on, so the learning process could\n\n194\n00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.950\ntake a little bit longer, and\nthe data base could really grow in size.\n\n195\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.950\nSo, what do we do after\nthe learning process is over?\n\n196\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:38.510\nAll right, once it's figured out, this is\nwhat I think should happen, all right?\n\n197\n00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.860\nWell, that's where we get into\nthe process is in the database.\n\n198\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.400\nNotice that now that's it's learned,\nthe database says this is what our\n\n199\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.930\nnormal processes are,\nfrom what we just learned before.\n\n200\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.220\nSo process one, we green light it, right?\n\n201\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.900\nOr green check mark, greenlight it.\n\n202\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.460\nIt's go.\n\n203\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.570\nLet it run.\n\n204\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.720\nProcess two, we've learned it's good.\n\n205\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.580\nProcess three, we've learned it's good.\n\n206\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:06.240\nWell, what happens when something\nisn't in that database?\n\n207\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.350\nSo now we're going from learning.\n\n208\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.620\nNo enforcement, right?\n\n209\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.370\nOnce the learning process has finished.\n\n210\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.500\nNow we jump over and\nwe lock it down, all right?\n\n211\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.090\nNow we switch over to enforcement mode.\n\n212\n00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.500\nAnd enforcement mode,\nat this point, what we're hoping.\n\n213\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.742\nThis is always what we're hoping.\n\n214\n00:10:21.742 --> 00:10:22.254\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.180\n>> Is that it is learned what\n\n216\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.750\nshould happen on your network.\n\n217\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.450\nSo it says, all right well,\nI see process one here.\n\n218\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.970\nIt's happening here on this folder.\n\n219\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.360\nI look in the database over here and I see\nthat yeah, that's in the database as well.\n\n220\n00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.850\nI see process two, is in the database.\n\n221\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.160\nNotice process three's here but\n\n222\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.150\nwe're not worried it,\nwe're not even doing process three.\n\n223\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.970\nBut now we plug a device in, remember\nwe go back to that bootloader virus,\n\n224\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.900\nwhere we plugged that USB device in,\nautoplay triggers.\n\n225\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.120\nAnd now there's some\nkind of functionality,\n\n226\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.810\nthat we're not even aware of,\nthat's going on in the background.\n\n227\n00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.910\nFor you and I, there might be a little\ncommand prompt that maybe we see blips and\n\n228\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.830\nwe dont see anything else.\n\n229\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.960\nGot to love those, when that happens.\n\n230\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.687\nI'm always thinking virus\nscan at that point.\n\n231\n00:10:57.687 --> 00:11:00.620\nRight [LAUGH] but we have a little\ncommand prompt or something.\n\n232\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.710\nMaybe it's even completely\ntransparent to the end user.\n\n233\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.850\nAll right, well, if it's a virus that's\nusing signature based definitions,\n\n234\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.280\nokay, if it triggers, right,\nand that virus is known, well,\n\n235\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.540\nthen it quarantines it, and\nit produces some kind of action.\n\n236\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.470\nIf it's heuristics,\nagain, it's that logic.\n\n237\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.560\nIt's saying it might be a problem.\n\n238\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.940\nIt might not be a problem, but at this\npoint, we're not worried about the code.\n\n239\n00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.860\nRemember, we know what actions\nshould be happening and\n\n240\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.220\nwhat shouldn't be happening, we think.\n\n241\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.380\nAll right, so unknown process.\n\n242\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.410\nSomebody plugs in a USB device and\ngoes to run a boot loader,\n\n243\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.090\nit's gonna start interacting with our\nsystem files down there in the lowest\n\n244\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.910\nlevels of the kernel and that scanning\nservice says, well wait a second.\n\n245\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.190\nI see process one, I see process two.\n\n246\n00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.230\nI see those in the database.\n\n247\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.990\nI don't know what this process is.\n\n248\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.820\nAll right.\n\n249\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.150\nSo since I don't know what that process\nis, I don't find it in the database.\n\n250\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.620\nI'm gonna shut it down.\n\n251\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.170\nAll right.\nNow that could be a good thing, and\n\n252\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.420\nit could be a bad thing.\n\n253\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.130\nRight?\nOne of the things Mike mentioned was false\n\n254\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:56.970\npositives, right?\n\n255\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.820\nWell, this is exactly\nwhat he's talking about.\n\n256\n00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.450\nThose false positives happen,\n\n257\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:06.250\nwhat if plugging that USB device\nin was a sneakernet file transfer?\n\n258\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.030\nAll right?\n\n259\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.950\nSomebody gave you the USB.\n\n260\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.750\nYou know who is in the company,\n\n261\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.970\nwe're not talking about picking it\nup out of the parking lot, right?\n\n262\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.990\nYou know whose it is, all right?\n\n263\n00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.800\nIt's a common thing that\nhappens within your network.\n\n264\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.660\nAll right.\n\n265\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.918\nWell that's the point of when we have\nto say okay, do we take that and\n\n266\n00:12:22.918 --> 00:12:24.280\nwe change it around?\n\n267\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.210\nAll right?\n\n268\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.550\nWe say, well you know what,\nwe've seen that service.\n\n269\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.930\nWe've seen that maybe\nit should be allowed.\n\n270\n00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.560\nLet me just move that out of the way for\na second.\n\n271\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:41.780\nAnd that becomes let's say over here,\nthat becomes process four.\n\n272\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.770\nSo your process three isn't\neven running right now so\n\n273\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.470\nwe don't even have to worry about it but\nthis is process four.\n\n274\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.500\nAnd now the next time that runs it\ndoesn't become an unknown process,\n\n275\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.330\nit becomes a known process.\n\n276\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.110\nRight?\nProcess four.\n\n277\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.120\nAll right now it's whitelisted.\n\n278\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.560\nWhat does whitelisting mean?\n\n279\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.850\nIf that was blacklisted,\nthe opposite right, the blacklisted.\n\n280\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.920\nDon't run this.\n\n281\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.790\nWhen we go in to enforcement mode,\nwe blacklist everything that is unknown.\n\n282\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.790\nEven the ones that we need.\n\n283\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.350\nSo that's one of the problems with one of\nthe drawbacks to the learning process.\n\n284\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.870\nThat's why I say, if you're gonna\nturn learning process off, and\n\n285\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.297\nyou're gonna use behavior based signature,\nor behavior base scanning.\n\n286\n00:13:21.297 --> 00:13:23.300\nTurn everything on.\n\n287\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.150\nAll right, better to know now\nwhat's going on your network.\n\n288\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.100\nTurn everything on, all right.\n\n289\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.017\nAnd then after the fact, when you\nswitch over to the enforcement mode,\n\n290\n00:13:32.017 --> 00:13:35.476\nif it blacklists some of the things\nthat weren't on that list,\n\n291\n00:13:35.476 --> 00:13:40.139\nwell then you're probably going to have a\nlittle bit easier of a time whitelisting.\n\n292\n00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:43.541\nBut if you're running only half of the\nprocess that's there when you go through\n\n293\n00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:45.977\nthe learning process,\nthen you go to enforcement mode,\n\n294\n00:13:45.977 --> 00:13:48.843\nhalf of the stuff within your\nnetwork starts to die, or whatever.\n\n295\n00:13:48.843 --> 00:13:51.760\nDoesn't perform the way you want it to.\n\n296\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.690\nNow let's say that that process isn't.\n\n297\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.950\nWe'll go back to the original here, right?\n\n298\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.640\nWe know that that is an unknown process.\n\n299\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.040\nAll right.\nThat's where the black listing comes in.\n\n300\n00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.390\nI'll try to quit putting an icon here.\n\n301\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.150\nThere we go.\n\n302\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.770\nAll right.\nSo it's an unknown process.\n\n303\n00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.520\nBecause it's not in that database\nthe scanning service sees it.\n\n304\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.120\nAnd it stops it in its tracks.\n\n305\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.150\nNot based on what the code is but based on\nwhat the action is that it's performing.\n\n306\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.790\nAll right.\n\n307\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.810\nThe other thing I would like to mention\nis how do we know what actions.\n\n308\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.790\nWhat are you talking about\nwhen you say actions?\n\n309\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.910\nWell, this is another one of those\nexpert scanning type services, right?\n\n310\n00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.910\nThis expert service where\nyour vendors themselves,\n\n311\n00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.570\nthey do sandbox testing,\nthey aren't so much looking at code.\n\n312\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.400\nNow I'm sure they're looking at code too\ncuz they probably have complete solutions\n\n313\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.570\nthat are doing all of the above.\n\n314\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.740\nRight?\n\n315\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.280\nBut to monitor the behavior,\nthey have to see the virus in action.\n\n316\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.370\nYou cannot monitor its behavior and\n\n317\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:55.065\ngenerate some kind of identification\nif you don't know what's going on.\n\n318\n00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:58.575\nSo you can see processes that\nare already whitelisted beforehand.\n\n319\n00:14:58.575 --> 00:14:59.135\nRight?\n\n320\n00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:02.555\nSo for instance SVC Host,\nis that one that we see?\n\n321\n00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:04.225\nWe always see a whole bunch of them right?\n\n322\n00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:08.555\nWell you're not gonna, going out the gate\nprobably, block that type of service.\n\n323\n00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:09.505\nRight?\nYou're probably not\n\n324\n00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:13.625\ngoing out the gate gonna\nblacklist the RPC service, right?\n\n325\n00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:17.010\nBreak half of Windows services and\nall it's dependencies.\n\n326\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.770\nSo there are some known processes that\ncould already be in that database.\n\n327\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.390\nBut, what is really, really cool.\n\n328\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.350\nWhat I really like about this\nsolution is that it is tailor made to\n\n329\n00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.360\nthe processes and the actions that\nare going on in your network.\n\n330\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.760\nIt's not a one size fits all.\n\n331\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.060\nIt's not the one size fits all type hat.\n\n332\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.580\nSignature databases, when they start out.\n\n333\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.100\nThat's what they are.\n\n334\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.830\nThis is what you have and\nthat works for everybody.\n\n335\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.510\nWell, that's what everybody gets.\n\n336\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.590\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.800\nWell maybe that's not appropriate for\nyour network.\n\n338\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.140\nMaybe Mikes network is running\nexchange and sequel but\n\n339\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.760\nmy network is just running\na voice over IP system.\n\n340\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.250\nDifferent protocols, different actions,\n\n341\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.280\ndifferent rules that are applying\nto that network, right.\n\n342\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.486\nSo if we're looking for\n\n343\n00:15:51.486 --> 00:15:55.709\nvoice over IP signatures then I'm going to\nbe okay right and maybe potentially okay\n\n344\n00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:58.806\nwith some of the other things\nthat I don't really need them.\n\n345\n00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:01.941\nI'm not running SQL, I'm not running and\nmaybe even in Active Directory.\n\n346\n00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:04.821\nSo that's one of the good\nthings about the behavior based\n\n347\n00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:07.701\nScanning is that while it can\ngenerate false positives,\n\n348\n00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.900\nit does get you a database that's\nmore tailor-made to what you need.\n\n349\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.550\nWhat actions are going on on you network.\n\n350\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.760\nRight?\nSo,\n\n351\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.530\nagain, you do have some\nbenefits over here.\n\n352\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.208\nOne of the drawbacks, I would say,\nis that like heuristics,\n\n353\n00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:24.005\nthis is another one that's gonna\ntake a lot of CPU power, Mike.\n\n354\n00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:27.313\nAnd anytime we have CPU power we're\nrobbing performance otherwise.\n\n355\n00:16:27.313 --> 00:16:31.060\nSo you do have to watch this one as\nbeing a performance hindrance as well.\n\n356\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.560\n>> Yeah and like you said, the fact that\nit's reactive instead of being proactive.\n\n357\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.070\nThat's got to be a big\ndownside too because\n\n358\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.190\nthe action is already occurring and\nI'm detecting the action.\n\n359\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.460\nHopefully I detected, maybe I'm detecting\nit on one machine and I can shut it down.\n\n360\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.380\nBefore it starts spreading\nto other machines, but\n\n361\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.610\nit is already in the process.\n\n362\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.500\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n363\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.020\nSo one of the others cons that I\ndidn't mention, I gotta mention this,\n\n364\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.470\nis the delay in the learning process,\nright?\n\n365\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.830\nThat's gotta be something that's gonna be\na little bit of a drawback to behavior\n\n366\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.970\nbased systems.\n\n367\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.790\nBecause, like we've kind of already talked\nabout, the actions already happening.\n\n368\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.318\nAll right, and\nif the action is already happening,\n\n369\n00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.510\nthen the virus is doing\nwhat it wants to do so.\n\n370\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.870\nIn that delay in the learning process,\nyou could, your network could be\n\n371\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.100\nhaving invasive malicious software\nthat you are not aware of yet.\n\n372\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.980\nSo pros and cons to it, right?\n\n373\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.860\nThe pros are the fact that you're looking\nat the actions, I don't care, right.\n\n374\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.850\nSee code modifications that happen,\n\n375\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.250\nit doesn't even have to\nbe polymorphic viruses.\n\n376\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.940\nIt doesn't have to be that the change,\nthe metamorphosis\n\n377\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.640\nprocess inside of the code itself\nis reacting in real time, right?\n\n378\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.750\nHackers.\n\n379\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.910\nThey get a virus.\n\n380\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.910\nThey know that there's been\nan established signature.\n\n381\n00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.180\nWhat do they do?\nThey open up the code and\n\n382\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.900\nthey modify the semantics\nof it a little bit.\n\n383\n00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.910\nAnd they release it out\nas their own virus.\n\n384\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.840\nWell, now it gets through the signature.\n\n385\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.920\nBut the problem is that\nthe functionality stays the same.\n\n386\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.010\nGuess what?\n\n387\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.550\nCode modifications.\n\n388\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.600\nIt's not gonna be a very\neffective method for\n\n389\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.390\nevasion on this type of scanning service.\n\n390\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.200\nBecause we're not looking\nat that to begin with.\n\n391\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.260\nSo there are benefits.\n\n392\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.010\nDrawbacks, again, the learning\nprocess takes a little bit of delay.\n\n393\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.922\nOne of the benefits, though,\nis code modifications aren't very good for\n\n394\n00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:07.052\nevasive maneuvers.\n\n395\n00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:09.531\n>> And I'm assuming so,\nsome of these antiviruses though,\n\n396\n00:18:09.531 --> 00:18:11.360\nthey kind of include all of these methods.\n\n397\n00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.030\nWe don't rely on just one or the other.\n\n398\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.860\nWe run a solution that maybe\ndoes a little bit of both.\n\n399\n00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.152\nIt's got signatures in there but\nit's also behavior based.\n\n400\n00:18:18.152 --> 00:18:19.383\n>> Definitely.\n\n401\n00:18:19.383 --> 00:18:23.891\nWhen you think about you know,\nwe do like whitelisting and\n\n402\n00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:28.586\nblacklisting type of functionality\ninside of signatures.\n\n403\n00:18:28.586 --> 00:18:29.910\nSignature scanning, right?\n\n404\n00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.920\nHow we do that?\nWe say exclude file types.\n\n405\n00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.510\nDont you know, dont,\ndon't scan this location.\n\n406\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.023\nSo when it comes down to it,\nyou do have some benefits in here.\n\n407\n00:18:39.023 --> 00:18:41.916\nI'd like to talk a little bit about\ntoo how the process works and\n\n408\n00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:43.998\nhow it differs a little\nbit from Heuristics.\n\n409\n00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.718\nCause Mike and I,\nwe were actually off camera,\n\n410\n00:18:46.718 --> 00:18:49.760\nwe were talking pretty\nextensively about this one.\n\n411\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.340\nHeuristics and behavioral based,\na lot of times they seem really,\n\n412\n00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.220\nreally close to the same, right?\n\n413\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.550\nKeep in mind that for the most part,\n\n414\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.960\nbehavior based is looking at the actions,\nnot the code.\n\n415\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.920\nHeuristics is looking at the code,\nnot necessarily actions.\n\n416\n00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.230\nBoy, that's a reversal there.\n\n417\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.960\nThe other thing is with heuristics,\nthere is no learning process.\n\n418\n00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.130\nRight?\nWe're still basing it off of something we\n\n419\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:11.930\nalready know.\n\n420\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:17.171\nAt least in some, some point you know,\nwe have some idea of what is there,\n\n421\n00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:20.810\nwhats there but\nwe enforce we block right away.\n\n422\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.650\nWhen I set a heuristic scanner I'm\nnot waiting for a learning process so\n\n423\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.800\nI set a enforcement mode so\n\n424\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.730\nif gives you the potential to\nhave false positives immediately.\n\n425\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.090\nRight, it's a little different\nwith behavior based right.\n\n426\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:35.470\nBehavior based we install the software and\nwe don't go into enforcement mode right\n\n427\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.220\nnon enforcement mode that learning\nprocess that we're talking about and\n\n428\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.170\nthe delay that comes along with\nit can also be the con right?\n\n429\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.780\nBut then, once we've figured\nout what normal behavior is.\n\n430\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.960\nIt gives us a chance, or\n\n431\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.610\nthe software a chance to find\nout what abnormal behavior is.\n\n432\n00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.610\nOnce we've established that,\nthen we kick it into enforcement mode.\n\n433\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.850\nNow we're enforcing, and\nnow we're coming back.\n\n434\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.370\nAnd we're doing the white listing.\n\n435\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.970\nSo where you do your white listing\nis a little bit different and\n\n436\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.750\nwhen you turn the enforcement modes\non are a little bit different.\n\n437\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.570\nBut again,\n\n438\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.280\nregardless of what it scanning service\nyou're using, make sure it's up to date.\n\n439\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.750\nDoesn't matter if it's a signatures,\ndoesn't matter if it's heuristics,\n\n440\n00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.860\nheuristics needs to be up to date Right?\n\n441\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.990\nAs they come out.\n\n442\n00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.700\nYou know, these brilliant people out\nthere with their coding and stuff.\n\n443\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.560\nThey come out with algorithms that can\nget more effective at the thinking\n\n444\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.050\nprocess, right?\n\n445\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.480\nSome behaviors that viruses\ndo are well established.\n\n446\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.290\nWe know, right?\n\n447\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.040\nWe have viruses going back to the early\n90s that are still out there.\n\n448\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.270\nOf course, we've patched our systems up.\n\n449\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.970\nBut, they're well established\nas to what they do.\n\n450\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.890\nSo that doesn't mean that we can negate\n\n451\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.930\nupdating the antivirus software just\nbecause we're not looking at the code.\n\n452\n00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.990\nThere are certain things you\ndo need to keep it up to date.\n\n453\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.450\nAnd like Mike said we don't\nhave to get a heuristics base.\n\n454\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.710\nWe don't have to get a signature based.\n\n455\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.000\nAnd then a behavioral based.\n\n456\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.770\nWe don't have to get one for\ntrojans, for viruses.\n\n457\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.560\nFor botnets, rootkits.\n\n458\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.820\nIt's all encompassing.\n\n459\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.770\nBut one of the things that you have to\ndo is just pay attention to the scanning\n\n460\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.590\noptions.\n\n461\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.060\nThat's one of the big things.\n\n462\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.180\nWhether it supports that or not is really\ncontingent on what software you have.\n\n463\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.320\nYou also get there, get in there and\nget into the settings.\n\n464\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.570\nA lot of these good pieces of software.\n\n465\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.950\nThey'll have a restore to defaults.\n\n466\n00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.807\nSo, that's great for me.\n\n467\n00:21:13.807 --> 00:21:14.968\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That's like a get out of jail\n\n468\n00:21:14.968 --> 00:21:15.520\nfree card right.\n\n469\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520\nI go in there and\n\n470\n00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:21.960\nI'm configuring it without my spectacles\nand of course I configure something wrong.\n\n471\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.870\nI think I'm doing something good.\n\n472\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.860\nGo ahead and restore to defaults.\n\n473\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.620\nIf you think you have to go back over\nthat learning process in a small\n\n474\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.280\nenvironment it might not take that long.\n\n475\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.780\nNow you might want to be a little bit\nmore, I would say concerned in a larger\n\n476\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.660\nenvironment with a lot more processes\nbecause you might say well at the end of\n\n477\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.770\nthe two weeks we know what's going on and\nwe gotta start that process again.\n\n478\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.585\nSo if it's a two week process, now\nyou're up to a month without protection.\n\n479\n00:21:45.585 --> 00:21:46.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n480\n00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.220\n>> So, be careful with that.\n\n481\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.740\nBut again, like I said, whatever you run,\nrun something, Keep it up to date.\n\n482\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.270\nMake sure that you're scanning.\n\n483\n00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.820\nKeep in mind that just\ninstalling antivirus software\n\n484\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.090\nisn't going to help you.\n\n485\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.837\nYou have to make sure that\nyou utilize it as well.\n\n486\n00:21:59.837 --> 00:22:01.130\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Or it doesn't make any sense.\n\n487\n00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.200\nSo just make sure you're secure.\n\n488\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.720\n>> Very good.\nAll right, well thanks Wes.\n\n489\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.950\nA lot of great information there.\n\n490\n00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.470\nReally helping us See the differences\nin the types of anti-virus.\n\n491\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.460\nThere isn't just anti-virus solutions.\n\n492\n00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.260\nYou've got behavior based.\n\n493\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.620\nYou've got heuristics based.\n\n494\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.960\nYou've got signature based or\ncombinations thereof.\n\n495\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.070\nEach one with its own pros and cons.\n\n496\n00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.680\nAnd so we've gotta know what solution's\ngonna work best in our environment,\n\n497\n00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.950\nor what combination of solutions.\n\n498\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.450\nMight work best for us in our environment.\n\n499\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.620\nSo thanks, Wes, appreciate it.\n\n500\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.380\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n>> Great explanations there.\n\n501\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.790\nLadies and gentleman that is gonna\ndo it for this particular episode.\n\n502\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.650\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n503\n00:22:36.650 -->

--> 00:00:17.059\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.309\nAnd today we're gonna be looking\nat antivirus anti-malware.\n\n5\n00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:25.130\nAnd specifically we're going to be looking\nat what we call consumer grade antivirus.\n\n6\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.631\nAnd to help us explain what the heck\nthat is, we have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:29.351\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n8\n00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:30.151\n>> It's going good, man.\n\n9\n00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.061\nIt's good to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.110\nGreat to have everybody\nout there with you.\n\n11\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.881\nThank you for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:37.160\nWe're gonna talk a lot\nabout consumer grade\n\n13\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.310\nantivirus software here\ninside of this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.100\nSo what is it that consumer grade\nantivirus software means for us?\n\n15\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.490\nWell, a little bit different than what\nyou find in the enterprise level.\n\n16\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.530\nAnd when we look at\nconsumer grade antivirus,\n\n17\n00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.000\nwhat we're talking about is typically for\na home environment, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.550\nMaybe it best to small office, home office\nbut it's not so important, if you will,\n\n19\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.300\nto have some of the extra functionalities\nthat we'll talk about in enterprise\n\n20\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.930\nlevel software.\n\n21\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.620\nSo that's one of the first things we have\nto talk about when we say consumer grade.\n\n22\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.400\nConsumer grade we're not potentially\ngoing to get all of the added features,\n\n23\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.910\nif you will,\n\n24\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.230\nthe extra features that maybe some more\nof the business-class software can get.\n\n25\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.270\nSo let's go ahead and, I'll tell you what,\n\n26\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.560\nlet's take a look at one of\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n27\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.980\nYou know,\nwhen you talk about consumer-grade,\n\n28\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.640\ndon't even worry about an admin at this\npoint, we'll leave the admin out of here.\n\n29\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.250\nAll right.\n\n30\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.540\nWhen you look at consumer grade,\ntypically we'll call this, for\n\n31\n00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.570\ninstance, host-based antivirus software.\n\n32\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.910\nAnd what do we mean by host-based?\n\n33\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.170\nIt's typically a single piece of\nsoftware running on a single machine.\n\n34\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.760\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind\nis that with these scans, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.290\nEvery time you install\na piece of software,\n\n36\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.440\nyou're gonna have to do\nthe old sneaker net, right?\n\n37\n00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.390\nThe sneaker net, you're gonna\nhave to get up from your desk,\n\n38\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.940\nyou're gonna have to go\nto the next computer.\n\n39\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo Mike, if I have like five\ncomputers in my network,\n\n40\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.720\nwhich I do [LAUGH] how do I\nmanage to maintain those?\n\n41\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.090\nWell with the consumer grade,\nthat's one of the things that we have\n\n42\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.040\nto really worry about, it the fact that I\nhave to go to each one of those machines.\n\n43\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.480\nAll right, this could potentially be\nseparate license for each machine.\n\n44\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.560\nOne of the first things I think of\nMike is the separate license factor.\n\n45\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.540\nI buy one license it's good for\nthat one machine.\n\n46\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.730\n>> That and my big thing with this would\nbe the administration as you were saying.\n\n47\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.100\nI mean, if I installed on a new machine.\n\n48\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.862\nWell, now I've got to\nconfigure it as well, right?\n\n49\n00:02:28.862 --> 00:02:32.720\nI've got to decide what folders to\nexclude, what kind of scans I want to run,\n\n50\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.400\nand how often.\n\n51\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.670\nBecause all of the configuration is done\nindividually on each piece of hardware.\n\n52\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.095\n>> That's right.\nSo, right here, our admin,\n\n53\n00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:42.790\nas we add PCs or additional devices.\n\n54\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.290\nIt doesn't have to be,\nI mean it generically, personal computers.\n\n55\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.190\nAs we have the devices on our networks\nthis admin's administrative complexities,\n\n56\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.850\nthe work that he or\n\n57\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.930\nshe is gonna have to do on their network\nis gonna exponentially increase.\n\n58\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.200\nIt's one of the reasons they\nlimit workgroups, right,\n\n59\n00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.210\nbecause of the fact that if it\nstarts getting too many computers,\n\n60\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.440\nit just becomes a nightmare to manage.\n\n61\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.170\nThe other thing is the scanning,\nall right.\n\n62\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.550\nIf I'm gonna implement a scan\nin consumer grade software,\n\n63\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.480\njust like Mike says, I don't have\nthat centralized administration.\n\n64\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.600\nI wish I could log into one computer and\ntell that one computer you know what I\n\n65\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.630\nwant you to send scans out\nto the entire network.\n\n66\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.940\nIn consumer grade your going to have\nto walk independently to each computer.\n\n67\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.547\nAnd your going to have to perform scans.\n\n68\n00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:24.998\nNow does that mean you\ncan't schedule a scan?\n\n69\n00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:25.690\nNo.\n\n70\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.540\nThat's not what it means.\n\n71\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.700\nIt just means to verify that scan\nthat you scheduled was running,\n\n72\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.840\nyou're gonna have to go to that machine,\nall right.\n\n73\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.320\nAnd these machines here for diagram\npurposes, they're relatively close.\n\n74\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.840\nBut what if you, you're in an entire,\nyou got a big house, or like I said,\n\n75\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.670\nmaybe you do have a small office,\nhome office.\n\n76\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.630\nAnd maybe you can't afford the,\n\n77\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.570\nI don't know, thousands of dollars some\nenterprise level software would give you.\n\n78\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.570\nSo you decide, you know what,\nI'm gonna go with the consumer grade,\n\n79\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.830\ncuz, you know,\nbetter to have something than nothing.\n\n80\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.341\nWell there again, every single individual\ncomputer's gonna have to be monitored.\n\n81\n00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:03.441\nAnd as we know with things like BYOD,\nis it BYO?\n\n82\n00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:04.860\nBring your own device, that's right.\n\n83\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.170\nI always have to make sure\nI get that one right.\n\n84\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.610\nBring your own device, right?\n\n85\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.240\nSo we have cell phones, devices as well\nthat we need to monitor and manage and\n\n86\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.000\nmaintain.\n\n87\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.530\nWe have additional network devices,\neven in a small environment.\n\n88\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.140\nThe problem is,\nthere's no collective support.\n\n89\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.250\nSo if you can imagine going from\na network like this, and this is one of\n\n90\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.319\nthe big things that differentiates\nthe antivirus software, right.\n\n91\n00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.790\nThe enterprise software.\n\n92\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.810\nIt's the fact that now if\nI use enterprise software,\n\n93\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.900\nI get a centralized\nmanagement system typically.\n\n94\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.470\nNot always, but a majority of\nthe time that's what you need, right?\n\n95\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.850\nYou want centralized administration,\n\n96\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.650\nthat's one of the things that makes our\njobs as admins a little bit easier.\n\n97\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.200\nAll right?\n\n98\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.640\nI can deploy software.\n\n99\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.010\nIf I'm gonna deploy anti-malware\nsoftware in an environment like this,\n\n100\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.750\nWell, now we gotta lace up the shoes\nagain, and we're going sneaker net.\n\n101\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.070\nAnd we have to install it one at a time.\n\n102\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.080\nIf I do it in something like an enterprise\nenvironment, where we have a bunch of\n\n103\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.360\ncomputers on the network, I'm gonna\nget the centralized administration.\n\n104\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.750\nAnd even coupling this\nwith other technologies,\n\n105\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.370\nlike they call them ESDs I believe,\nthe electronic software distribution.\n\n106\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.700\nSo now, with other management software,\nthat's the other thing, integration.\n\n107\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.390\nAnd that's one of the things that you\nlack a little bit in the consumer grade\n\n108\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.740\nsoftware, all right.\n\n109\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.670\nConsumer grade software is basically,\nfor the most part, stand-alone.\n\n110\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.790\nNow when I say stand-alone it doesn't mean\nthat one anti-virus software might say,\n\n111\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.400\nwe're gonna protect your web browsing.\n\n112\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.560\nWe're gonna look at websites for you and\nwe're gonna tell you with a little symbol\n\n113\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.430\nthat those websites are good and\nto be trusted.\n\n114\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.650\nI'm not saying that it doesn't\nhave additional components inside\n\n115\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.680\nof the consumer grade antivirus, it could\nbe doing all kinds of things, right.\n\n116\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.410\nCould be scanning your emails.\n\n117\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.200\nIt could be providing things like adware\nprotection you know, spyware protection.\n\n118\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.160\nCould even have an integrated pop-up\nblocker even though the web browsers\n\n119\n00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.350\nI know have that.\n\n120\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.540\nBut it lacks the integration\nwith management systems,\n\n121\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.700\nand other management systems.\n\n122\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.770\nA lot of times the enterprise levels,\neven if they're a stand-alone product,\n\n123\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.230\na lot of times they will\ngive you the ability to\n\n124\n00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.680\nintegrate it within technologies that\nyou already have in your networks.\n\n125\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.190\nSo that's one of the things we have\nto keep in mind is that it's very\n\n126\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.320\ndecentralized, I think is what really\nis getting to the point is that\n\n127\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.960\nconsumer grade the management behind,\n\n128\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.100\nis a completely decentralized model there,\nMike.\n\n129\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.870\n>> Yeah from installing the software\nto licensing the software to setting up\n\n130\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.330\nthe scans.\n\n131\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.990\nAs well as things like updates, right?\n\n132\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.240\nWe gotta update that database.\n\n133\n00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.830\nIf I have that enterprise level,\nI might update one set of definitions.\n\n134\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.620\nThen all my machines used.\n\n135\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.930\nWith this consumer-grade, each machine\nhas its own database that it's accessing.\n\n136\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.160\nSo I've gotta do those updates of those\ndefinitions on every single machine.\n\n137\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.360\nIf I miss one.\n\n138\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.110\nNow that one is a security\nrisk because it's updates or\n\n139\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.570\nit's definitions aren't updated.\n\n140\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.710\n>> Yeah, and that's right and\n\n141\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.790\nsomebody might say well you know\nwhat Mike I created a task.\n\n142\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.860\nWent to every single one of my\ncomputers and I created a task.\n\n143\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.670\nWell, that's still not\ncentralized administration.\n\n144\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.820\n>> You still had to do it\non every single computer.\n\n145\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.606\n>> You still had to do\nit on every computer and\n\n146\n00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.300\nyou still had to automate the process.\n\n147\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.020\n>> Yep.\n>> Well, try\n\n148\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.525\nto automate the process as best you can.\n\n149\n00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:04.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you have to be careful with that.\n\n150\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.260\nThat's one of the things.\n\n151\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.840\nNow you might ask yourself as\nwell when it comes to money.\n\n152\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.420\nShould I pay for a solution, or\nshould maybe I get a free solution?\n\n153\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.760\nWell, that depends, right?\n\n154\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.811\nThere's plenty of solutions\nout there that are free, and\n\n155\n00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:21.232\nplease understand, I'm not picking on one\nand saying one is better over the other,\n\n156\n00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.677\none of the first ones that\ncomes to mind is AVG.\n\n157\n00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:25.363\nAnd in a Windows system, Windows defender.\n\n158\n00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:26.520\nThese are free.\n\n159\n00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.080\nRight, and so what's wrong with them?\n\n160\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.780\nNot really anything wrong with them and\nfor\n\n161\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.460\nthe price point you really shouldn't\nthink there's [LAUGH] if you can't\n\n162\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.810\nafford to spend money on an antivirus\nsoftware you still need something.\n\n163\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.380\nAnd that's one of the great things about\na free solution like that is the fact,\n\n164\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.880\nfirst of all it's free we\ndon't have to pay for it.\n\n165\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.670\nThe vendor can manage and maintain it.\n\n166\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.230\nWe still need to do updates and\nthe great thing is,\n\n167\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.630\nwe don't have to worry too much about some\nof the behind the scenes stuff, all right?\n\n168\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.800\nWe update it, we set it,\nhopefully we can forget it.\n\n169\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.110\nBut, still check it.\n\n170\n00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.631\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n171\n00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:58.295\nThe other thing about the free ones that I\nmight mention with Windows defender Mike,\n\n172\n00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.257\nbecause I know you've been\nworking with Windows a long time.\n\n173\n00:08:00.257 --> 00:08:02.788\nIs the fact that it integrates\nwith your Windows update.\n\n174\n00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:06.882\nThat's one of the things that I really\nlike kind of falling back on Defender.\n\n175\n00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:09.890\nDoes it mean that Windows Defender\nis the best one out there?\n\n176\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.640\nNo, I'm not even close to saying that.\n\n177\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.450\nAll right, but there is benefits to\nit because I don't have to go to\n\n178\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.690\nanother product.\n\n179\n00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.235\nIf you're one of these ones that,\nmaybe you just spent $300 or\n\n180\n00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:19.333\n$400 on your computer.\n\n181\n00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.841\nEven if it's just a smaller computer,\nyou spent $300 or $400.\n\n182\n00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:23.932\nDo you really want to have to go out and\nspend $89?\n\n183\n00:08:23.932 --> 00:08:25.250\nOr whatever it is.\n\n184\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.330\nCould be 19 bucks, but\nmaybe you don't have that money.\n\n185\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.600\nWhat if you're a college student?\n\n186\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.275\nRight, you're living on Beanie Weenies,\nGoldfish and Pop Tarts.\n\n187\n00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:34.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You probably don't have any money to\n\n188\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.370\nspend on security class software,\nright, or paid software, but\n\n189\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.910\nat least you get the ability\nto have something.\n\n190\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.050\nTo have something on your machine\nas it goes from your school\n\n191\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.840\nwherever you're studying and then home and\nthen maybe on somebody else's network.\n\n192\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.580\nAll right?\n\n193\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.360\nAnd again,\ngetting back to the Windows Defender part,\n\n194\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.400\none of the things I like about that is\npart of all the dynamic security is when I\n\n195\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.090\nrun a Windows update, what does it do?\n\n196\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.710\nIt updates the definitions.\n\n197\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.080\nAnd that's one of the things that I really\nlike, because if you're not aware of\n\n198\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.960\nsomething that you have to configure and\nyou have to configure to get a benefit out\n\n199\n00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.660\nof it, that's where we start\nto come into problems, right?\n\n200\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.130\nIf I have to configure it\nnow with consumer grade.\n\n201\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.070\nAnd going back to consumer grade,\nlike Mike said,\n\n202\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.050\nI have to go to every single computer and\nconfigure it.\n\n203\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.590\nSo, free solution could be for you.\n\n204\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.520\nNow, you might say, well why would I want\nto pay then, if there's free solutions?\n\n205\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.340\nWell, a lot of times the paid solutions\nbecause a company is making their\n\n206\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.190\nmoney on this one.\n\n207\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.900\nType of product.\n\n208\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.390\nI'm not going to say\nthe one product right?\n\n209\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.650\nThink about Microsoft.\n\n210\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.330\nThey've got their hands in a lot\nof different pieces of software.\n\n211\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.780\nJust massive amounts of software and\n\n212\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.920\nall types of different\nthings not just security.\n\n213\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.210\nBut when you've got a company that their\nsole purpose, their bread and butter,\n\n214\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.610\ntheir money is contingent on how\ngood this security product is.\n\n215\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.330\nLike for instance, Trend Micro.\n\n216\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.010\nAll right?\n\n217\n00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.210\nIf I go to Trend Micro and I download\nsomething, yes, and I have to pay for\n\n218\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.830\nit, sure, I'm gonna get maybe\nsome more functionality.\n\n219\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.870\nI'm gonna get a dedicated, a company\nthat's dedicated to that software.\n\n220\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.590\nThat security software so\nit could be increased functionality.\n\n221\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.340\nNow again it doesn't have to be,\nit could be as little as ten bucks,\n\n222\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.780\nit could be probably as much as\nhundreds of dollars even for\n\n223\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.390\nlike an entire suite of utilities.\n\n224\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.950\nWhich might not just\nbe antivirus software.\n\n225\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.350\nSo you have to weigh the pros and cons.\n\n226\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.620\nAgain, one of the pros\nto paying the money,\n\n227\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.830\nis a lot of times when you pay the money\nyou get a few more bells and whistles.\n\n228\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.050\nAnd again,\nI'm not just talking about flair,\n\n229\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.820\nwhat I'm talking about is additional\nfunctionality, all right?\n\n230\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.420\nMaybe Windows Defender,\nwhat doesn't it do?\n\n231\n00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.750\nIt does nothing for\nyour web activity, right?\n\n232\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.640\nIt doesn't monitor my web activity.\n\n233\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.030\nIt doesn't say hey, now we've got\nother technologies that do that, but\n\n234\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.980\nWindows Defender itself doesn't All right,\nbut if I download something like McAfee.\n\n235\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.730\nOr if I download something\nlike Symantec or Trend Micro.\n\n236\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.200\nIt's got that functionality built in.\n\n237\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.470\nAnd you paid for\nthe functionality so it works.\n\n238\n00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.600\nBut you paid for the functionality.\n\n239\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.762\nNow not only is it doing things\nlike real-time protection,\n\n240\n00:10:56.762 --> 00:11:01.580\nreal-time monitoring, like the free ones\ndo, but now it's also doing the extra\n\n241\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.250\nthings, right, it's searching your emails,\nit's finding out\n\n242\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.540\nis there an email attachment before it\neven gets its way onto your computer.\n\n243\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.080\nIs it scanning those attachments, and\n\n244\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.170\nit's saying,\nyou might not want to download that.\n\n245\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.570\nI don't get the in Windows Defender, but\nI could get that in that page solution.\n\n246\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.880\nSo free solutions, again,\nif you're on a budget, perfect, right?\n\n247\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.150\nBetter have something.\n\n248\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.550\nPaid solutions, if you're on a budget,\nmay be not so good.\n\n249\n00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.610\nAnd I never say money is not a problem.\n\n250\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.760\nBut if you can afford it,\nthen that may be the way to go too.\n\n251\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.390\nBut one of the things again,\n\n252\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.290\nback to the free solution,\nyou don't have to if you don't want to.\n\n253\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.960\nAnd some security is better\nthan no security, right?\n\n254\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.320\n>> Absolutely, and\nI'll tell you what I look for in West and\n\n255\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.200\nin a lot of these AV solutions,\nis how often they put out updates.\n\n256\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.580\nHow often are they making new definitions?\n\n257\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.800\nIf it's a free solution but they're\nonly putting out updates once a week,\n\n258\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.620\nthat might not be good enough for\nme because that means there's a large\n\n259\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.490\nchunk of time when I have\nto go without any updates.\n\n260\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.380\nThey're working on them,\n\n261\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.290\nthey're slow to get them out,\nthat doesn't do me any good right?\n\n262\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.190\nI need something that where they're\ngonna put those updates out\n\n263\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.990\ntwice a day if they have to.\n\n264\n00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.930\nSometimes it's not weather it's paid or\nfree, but\n\n265\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.920\nit's what's the quality of the product.\n\n266\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.460\nAnd you can, as Wes said, you can\nfind really good free ones out there,\n\n267\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.700\nand some really bad free ones.\n\n268\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.710\nBut then again,\nthere's really good paid ones, and\n\n269\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.300\nthere's really bad paid ones right.\n\n270\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.440\nSo I look at how often they put out\nupdates, and then how many resources,\n\n271\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.820\nhow much resources they take.\n\n272\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.970\nYou know, some of these antivirus\nsolutions seem to bog me down.\n\n273\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.510\nSome of those extra features that\nI don't use and I don't need,\n\n274\n00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.110\nand maybe aren't worth it.\n\n275\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.010\nAnd I go for\n\n276\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.350\na less expensive solution that doesn't\nhave all those extra bells and whistles.\n\n277\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.220\nBecause, when I run it on my machine,\nit takes up 80% of my system resources.\n\n278\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.640\n>> Yeah, that's the bad thing.\n\n279\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.560\nYou go in there and check.\n\n280\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.690\nGet back to Windows Defender.\n\n281\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.430\nI know it updates with Windows Update.\n\n282\n00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.950\nI know that if I've got windows update\nturned on I'm going to have the most, and\n\n283\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.910\na network connection,\ngot to have an internet connection.\n\n284\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.810\nYou don't pay your internet bill\nyou're not going to connect anyway.\n\n285\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.740\nBut I know I'm going to get\nthe definitions updated.\n\n286\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.670\nNow like Mike said, quality of\nthe product, I go up and want to say\n\n287\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.530\nwhat is the version of the signature\ndatabase that's up on that page site?\n\n288\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.001\nAnd it says last updated April 15th, 2014.\n\n289\n00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:09.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, I might not want it.\n\n290\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.610\n>> You're not paying for it.\n\n291\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.080\n>> I was gonna say, I probably don't\ncare what it cost at that point.\n\n292\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.790\nYou should be taking the money and run.\n\n293\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.890\nAll right?\nSo the quality is a very very good point.\n\n294\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.510\nI'll tell you what.\n\n295\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.170\nLet's go ahead and let's kind of\nshow you around Windows defender and\n\n296\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.560\nan example of a consumer grade product.\n\n297\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.940\nNow, one of the things that we can\ndo here and let me go ahead and\n\n298\n00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.630\ncancel this installation here.\n\n299\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.380\nI was looking at another one\nhere in another episode.\n\n300\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.210\nAnd fairly easy to find,\n\n301\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.280\nguys, no more than one way to\nget to these locations here.\n\n302\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.594\nI love, typing Windows I was gonna\nsay I love the search functionality.\n\n303\n00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:44.545\nAll I've gotta do is start typing defend.\n\n304\n00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.131\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it finds, of course,\n\n305\n00:13:46.131 --> 00:13:48.531\nif you type Windows it finds\na whole bunch of other stuff,\n\n306\n00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:49.983\ntoo, that maybe you don't want.\n\n307\n00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:55.030\nAll right, one of the first things I wanna\nkind of talk about is the heads up view.\n\n308\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.120\nRight?\nRight away,\n\n309\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.780\nI can tell, when did the scan happen?\n\n310\n00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.790\nWell, I can see it happened today.\n\n311\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.510\nNow, I could see it happened\nright before lunch.\n\n312\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.285\nI can also see that the scan\nhas been scheduled.\n\n313\n00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:09.265\nRight?\n2 AM, why is it at 2 AM?\n\n314\n00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.455\nWell that's probably a good thing.\n\n315\n00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:11.755\nYou don't wanna be using your computer.\n\n316\n00:14:11.755 --> 00:14:14.875\nAnd like Mike says, when it uses those\nresources you're in the middle of, you\n\n317\n00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:18.185\nknow, some line of business application\nthat you're using on your computer.\n\n318\n00:14:18.185 --> 00:14:22.065\nAnd now unfortunately while it's running\na scan you feel like you're on dial-up,\n\n319\n00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:23.125\nyou know, or something.\n\n320\n00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.310\nSo you definitely have to consider that.\n\n321\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.332\nNow, real time protection.\n\n322\n00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.530\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n323\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.400\nWell, exactly what it sounds like.\n\n324\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.280\nIsn't actively scanning your machine.\n\n325\n00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.350\nIf you don't have real time protection,\n\n326\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.290\nthere again kinda like Mike said,\nyou're paying for it.\n\n327\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.010\nAll right?\n\n328\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.930\nSo you always wanna make sure.\n\n329\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.510\nAnd that's what really in\nall honesty they all have.\n\n330\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.170\nNow, I can also see\nthe version of the database.\n\n331\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.520\nNotice when it was created.\n\n332\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.790\nIt's not too long ago,\nit's certainly not April 14th, 2014.\n\n333\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.240\nBut I can update,\nI can maintain the signatures here.\n\n334\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.660\nNow, one of the good things is you can\nwait for Windows Update to do this, but\n\n335\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.030\nI don't have to.\n\n336\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.370\nI can go into Tools here,\nand I can go into Options.\n\n337\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.820\nAnd I can tell it when\ndo you wanna scan and\n\n338\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.030\nthen another thing, checking for\nupdates before scanning.\n\n339\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.690\nAll right, so that's a good thing.\n\n340\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.020\nI like any setting kinda setting that you\ncan, this is configured by default by\n\n341\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.190\nthe way but even if it is a paid version\nyou have to know what the settings are.\n\n342\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.970\nI like it when you can put a check mark\nin there and you walk away from it and\n\n343\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.960\nsay, before you scan,\ndo a definition update.\n\n344\n00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.850\nNow in the graphical user interface,\n\n345\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.300\nnotice I can say no,\nI don't want to do that, all right.\n\n346\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.140\nI don't want to check.\n\n347\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.640\nNow, that's not a really good setting.\n\n348\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.250\nI could also do this from\nthe command prompt as well.\n\n349\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.550\nIf I wanted to open a command prompt and\n\n350\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:47.000\nlook at this, let me get down into\nthe program files here right.\n\n351\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.433\nLet me do some navigation here,\nhopefully do some navigation here.\n\n352\n00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:55.861\nProgram files, where is that,\nWindows Defender, and\n\n353\n00:15:55.861 --> 00:16:00.007\nwe get in here a command in\nhere called mpcnd run, and\n\n354\n00:16:00.007 --> 00:16:04.361\nyou can put the .exe here if you want but\nit is implied.\n\n355\n00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:08.190\nAnd if you want, you could do a forward\nslash question mark, and what it is going\n\n356\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.180\nto ask you, is it is going to give you\nsome of the options like scan type.\n\n357\n00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.740\nAnd rather than just say it, lets go\nahead and just show you that, all right?\n\n358\n00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.370\nAnd a lot of information here and\n\n359\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.682\na little bit about some of the other\noptions that are here too.\n\n360\n00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:24.490\nAll right so your scan options,\nwhat do they do for us?\n\n361\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.520\nWell, with your scan options, all right?\n\n362\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.770\nNotice the zero.\n\n363\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.990\nZero means default and you guys,\nI know, can read that.\n\n364\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.980\nWhatever you set Windows defender to do,\nthat's what it's going to do.\n\n365\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.470\nIf you come here and say,\nI don't know what type of scan.\n\n366\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.490\nI don't know if I want a quick scan.\n\n367\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.720\nI don't know if I want a full scan.\n\n368\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.860\nSomebody's already configured this.\n\n369\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.960\nYou just do zero and\nit does what the default configuration is.\n\n370\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.140\nOne of the other things I want to show\nyou is if you do a quick scan, right?\n\n371\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.760\nSo, we'll run that same command and\nwe'll take the question mark off.\n\n372\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.270\nWe'll do scan and we'll do dash one.\n\n373\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.750\nHere's one of the things\nI want you to notice.\n\n374\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.520\nDid you notice Mike, there I unchecked.\n\n375\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.650\nEssentially the signature\ncheck in the GUI.\n\n376\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.510\nYou don't have that option here.\n\n377\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.210\nIt's going to check for updates.\n\n378\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.550\nOne of the great things here I\ncan tell you is that it says.\n\n379\n00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.860\nI updated this earlier that's\nwhy you're seeing that\n\n380\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.360\nrelatively recent date there for\nthe updates.\n\n381\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.569\nThe other thing I want\nto show you guys is.\n\n382\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.640\nsome of the options that you have here.\n\n383\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.810\nAlright one of the options that I really\nwant you to know is under the advanced.\n\n384\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:37.650\nBecause this is where you do a lot of the\nconfigurations inside Windows Defender.\n\n385\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.760\nScan archive files, scan email.\n\n386\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.080\nSo remember one of the things I was\ntelling you about ,that some paid software\n\n387\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.320\nwill also scan your email.\n\n388\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.000\nWell, guess what,\nthis is a free one; does the same thing.\n\n389\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.250\nSo, what extra functionality you get is\nreally contingent on the product that\n\n390\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.220\nyou're buying.\n\n391\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.390\nCan you use heuristics?\n\n392\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.360\nWell, I can use heuristics here.\n\n393\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.080\nScanning removable drives.\n\n394\n00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.021\nThe other option that's kind of\ninteresting that I want you to see is\n\n395\n00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:03.300\nthe creating a restore point, all right?\n\n396\n00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.890\nIf you quarantine a file, we've talked\nabout things like false positives, right?\n\n397\n00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.880\nWell, what if it identifies doing\nheuristics, and identifies that\n\n398\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.570\nit's gonna quarantine this file,\nif you will, this file.\n\n399\n00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.310\nAnd it's something that we need.\n\n400\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.220\nAll right.\nIf my default action, all right.\n\n401\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.830\nAnd what do I mean by default action?\n\n402\n00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.110\nLet's get to the tab that says default\naction and we'll show you that.\n\n403\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.430\nAll right, if heuristics notices and\nsays guess what?\n\n404\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.440\nThis is something that you need to remove,\nit quarantines it and it removes it.\n\n405\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.310\nNow my computer's broke.\n\n406\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.600\nThat's a good thing about\nabout the restore point.\n\n407\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.500\nThe restore point says\nthat if quarantines it and\n\n408\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.540\nit causes a problem, go ahead,\nturn around and restore it.\n\n409\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.413\nReal time protection, not really\nsure you'd want to turn this off.\n\n410\n00:18:51.413 --> 00:18:54.502\n[LAUGH] Or you'd be breaking\nyour anti-virus software, but\n\n411\n00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:57.720\nyou also have that too,\nnow we can also do exclusions, right?\n\n412\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.190\nExclusions basically say,\nlike for Mike, I know Mike\n\n413\n00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.890\ndoes a lot of security studies and stuff\nand security trading for that matter.\n\n414\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.840\nSo I'm sure you got that box of\nrattlesnakes that you're testing out\n\n415\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.720\nsoftware.\n\n416\n00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.390\nHas your anti-virus ever caught that?\n\n417\n00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.134\n>> Oh, it has.\nI've had it snag tools that I wanted to\n\n418\n00:19:13.134 --> 00:19:14.799\ntest.\nAnd if it,\n\n419\n00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:20.420\ndepending on what the action is right.\n\n420\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.970\nIf you're on those default behaviors.\n\n421\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.460\nThe default behavior might be\noh this is a severity high.\n\n422\n00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.130\nI'm going to quarantine it.\n\n423\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.320\nOr this is severity extremely high.\n\n424\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.030\nI'm just going to go ahead and remove it.\n\n425\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.300\nNot even bother quarantine it.\n\n426\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.300\nAnd then you go back and have your tools\nspent hours locating, downloading,\n\n427\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.900\nacquiring what have you.\n\n428\n00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.430\nHave been wiped from your machine,\nso it can be very, very frustrating.\n\n429\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.580\nSo yes, I've got folders\nthat are called no scan and\n\n430\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.150\nI know if I put things in there,\nmy anti virus is gonna leave it alone.\n\n431\n00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.850\n>> That's very good cuz and you know\nespecially with some of those utilities,\n\n432\n00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.470\nit's not like it's just freely available,\nyou just go get them again.\n\n433\n00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.820\nThere's a lot of licensing and\nstuff and waivers you've got to sign.\n\n434\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.800\nSo it could be you know in a scenario like\nthat it's no different than if you've got\n\n435\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.140\na process you've got a file that's got\nall your banking information on it.\n\n436\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.440\nAnd for whatever reason it\nquarantines it and deletes it.\n\n437\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.740\nNow that can be a problem.\n\n438\n00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.140\nSo you can also do some exclusions.\n\n439\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.930\nNow that being said.\n\n440\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.480\nLet's just show you.\n\n441\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.620\nWe kind of talked about it a little\nbit from the command prompt there.\n\n442\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.030\nThese are the different scans there.\n\n443\n00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:25.910\nAgain, custom scan this is inside\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n444\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.080\nbut it lacks the ability to do custom\nscans inside of the command prompt.\n\n445\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.430\nIf you are going to do this from\nthe command prompt here in Windows 7,\n\n446\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.490\nyour not going to have that functionality.\n\n447\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.970\nBut you can still do customized scans.\n\n448\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.030\nIn fact I don't even want\nto run this right now.\n\n449\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.210\nI tell you what Mike, we talked a lot\nabout scanning, let's go ahead and\n\n450\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.900\nfind a virus.\n\n451\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.900\nLet's go ahead and infect the computer and\nsee if we can find it.\n\n452\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.890\nYeah you might want to get\nyour computer off the network.\n\n453\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.880\nYou guys might want to get your computer.\n\n454\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.000\nI might want to get my computer off for\nthat matter.\n\n455\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.210\nWhen we do this, let's go ahead and\nset the stage right here guys,\n\n456\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:03.420\nI am using a series of files\nmaintained by E CAR out there,\n\n457\n00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:09.070\nbut if you have never heard about them,\nthese file types are used for\n\n458\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.440\nthe specific purposes\nof testing anti virus.\n\n459\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.890\nAll right, it's gonna flag this as a virus\nguys, but understand it's a test file.\n\n460\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.260\nAnd it is used and\nit is marked in most of all, if not\n\n461\n00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.680\nall of the major anti virus software\nas being a virus even though it isn't.\n\n462\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.400\nSo you can test Is your\nreal time protection.\n\n463\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.470\nMike says what am I paying for?\n\n464\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.780\nI wanna figure out,\ndo I have real time protection?\n\n465\n00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.510\nAm I paying for something and\ngetting that functionality?\n\n466\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.670\nWell let's see.\n\n467\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.780\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna move\nthis file, this dot com file over here,\n\n468\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.360\nso it looks kinda like an application,\nright?\n\n469\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.480\nLet's go ahead and let's see what\nWindows Defender does with that\n\n470\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.200\nnow remember guys one of the things I\ntold you, you do a quick scan, right?\n\n471\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.325\nQuick scans, and I keep hitting scan,\nlet's try to hit that arrow there,\n\n472\n00:21:54.325 --> 00:21:55.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n473\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.140\n>> Just a bit outside ball one.\n\n474\n00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.450\nOne of the things I told you is you can do\na quick scan, you can do a full scan and\n\n475\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.730\ncustom scan.\n\n476\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.040\nQuick scan,\nthat scan's common location were filed,\n\n477\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.210\nviruses are known to be located.\n\n478\n00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.440\nFull scan is exactly what it sounds like,\nscan everything.\n\n479\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.970\nCustom scan is exactly what\nit sounds like as well.\n\n480\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.890\nYou're gonna tell it where to scan and\nI'll tell you what,\n\n481\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.460\nwhat we're gonna do is for time sake here,\nif you got a one terrabyte drive and I say\n\n482\n00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.890\nhey Mike we're gonna do a malware scan,\nmight be three days before it's done so.\n\n483\n00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.360\nWe'll kind of just hurry, speed this up\na little bit, so you guys can see it and\n\n484\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.150\nwhat I'm doing is I'm going, this is,\nagain, keep in mind your customized scan.\n\n485\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:38.200\nAnd I'm saying, go to the user01's\nprofile and scan the desktop.\n\n486\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.830\nAnd we'll se what goes on here and\nwe'll do a scan now.\n\n487\n00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.780\nOh, apparently it didn't find anything.\n\n488\n00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.905\nSo, let's try that again.\n\n489\n00:22:45.905 --> 00:22:48.130\n[LAUGH] So maybe you aren't\ngetting your money's worth.\n\n490\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.460\n>> Or we logged on as the wrong user.\n\n491\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.330\n>> That very well could be,\nlet's just pay attention,\n\n492\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.520\nand I'll tell you what: we'll\ndo whole users, how about that?\n\n493\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.340\nIt's interesting that it\ndidn't find that file, and\n\n494\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.090\nI'm kind of wondering if- I don't\nthink I blacklisted it, so again.\n\n495\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.340\n>> If this is working right, we should see\nthere is a potential that, and you know,\n\n496\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.490\nthat's going to take a while for\nthat to happen.\n\n497\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:19.280\nI don't want to delay your guys' time\nout there so let's try that again.\n\n498\n00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.150\nAlso, what I'll go ahead and do, I,\nI do have one that I know is here and\n\n499\n00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.350\nI know it's gonna catch it.\n\n500\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.060\n>> Okay.\n>> Now,\n\n501\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.910\nyour software,\nagain speaking about your money worth,\n\n502\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:34.420\nmost good anti-malware software,\nit doesn't matter if it's a zipped folder.\n\n503\n00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.520\nIt should be able to scan inside of it.\n\n504\n00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.490\nTake a look down in that folder, and\nsay, hey you know what, I don't have any\n\n505\n00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.905\nexclusion types for Zip folders, but what\nI do inside of this zipped compressed file\n\n506\n00:23:43.905 --> 00:23:49.500\nr folder, excuse me, is the fact\nthat you have a virus in there,\n\n507\n00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.220\nand let me get out of all of these,\nI don't want any of these.\n\n508\n00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.820\nGotta speed up the process here,\nwe'll just narrow it down a little bit.\n\n509\n00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.361\nHopefully that'll be a little bit quicker,\nso in customizing the skin,\n\n510\n00:24:04.361 --> 00:24:06.274\nnow what it's doing is it's.\n\n511\n00:24:06.274 --> 00:24:09.510\nIn this case it can be using heuristic\nbecause I've got that turned on.\n\n512\n00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:13.407\nBut most likely what it's doing is it's\nlooking at that database of signature\n\n513\n00:24:13.407 --> 00:24:17.660\ndefinitions and it's looking through the\nfile hierarchy and the folder hierarchy,\n\n514\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.381\nin this case just on the desktop in\ncertain aspects of the user profile, and\n\n515\n00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:24.070\nsaying hey wait a second,\nlet me look through here.\n\n516\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.200\nLet me see if I find any files or\nfolders that have\n\n517\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.180\ncode in them that matches the signatures\nthat I have inside of the database.\n\n518\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.025\nAnd we hope, we're going to\ncross our fingers on this one.\n\n519\n00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:38.734\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll hope that by the end of\n\n520\n00:24:38.734 --> 00:24:42.957\nthis scan, which shouldn't take too much\nlonger, that you'll see that it goes red.\n\n521\n00:24:42.957 --> 00:24:48.564\nAnd it goes red because it says,\nI found some potentially damaging or\n\n522\n00:24:48.564 --> 00:24:51.376\nunwanted files on your computer.\n\n523\n00:24:51.376 --> 00:24:54.634\nNow depending on how you've\ngot like your alerts,\n\n524\n00:24:54.634 --> 00:24:59.271\nyour default actions, it could\nquarantine it and delete it right away.\n\n525\n00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:01.036\nDoesn't necessarily have to do that,\n\n526\n00:25:01.036 --> 00:25:03.499\nbecause your default action\nmight say quarantine it.\n\n527\n00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.440\nLet me know.\n\n528\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.660\nWarn me so that I'm aware of it, and\nthen let me go to that location and\n\n529\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.100\nlet me determine whether I\nwant to take this file out.\n\n530\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.960\nNow, it's done that.\n\n531\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.130\nIt told me right there,\npotentially harmful software is detected.\n\n532\n00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.980\nIt didn't detect it the first time.\n\n533\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.100\nAnd then I can go in here and\nI can review the items.\n\n534\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.170\nAll right, now this doesn't\nreally tell me much, right.\n\n535\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.400\nIt just says this is a Win32 and\nagain it's a test file,\n\n536\n00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.256\nbut it's supposed to be\nidentified as a virus.\n\n537\n00:25:33.256 --> 00:25:37.136\nNow regardless,\n\n538\n00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:42.250\nall right, notice that it finds that file.\n\n539\n00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.840\nIt found this one.\n\n540\n00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.380\nDot com.\n\n541\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.180\nAnd now notice, it says I looked\n\n542\n00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.560\nin eicar_com.zip, the zipped folder, and\nwhat I see is something inside of that.\n\n543\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.030\nAlright, so let's go ahead and\nlet's remediate this system.\n\n544\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.940\nSo, we can clean the system, but\nI'm going to say apply the actions.\n\n545\n00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.000\nLet's figure out what\nthe actions are here.\n\n546\n00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.920\nNow this severity level is, or\nalert level they call it, it's severe.\n\n547\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.790\nSo the default typically with severe level\nthreats is I'm going to quarantine it, but\n\n548\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.670\nthe moment you say apply\nthe default actions,\n\n549\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.710\nnot only am I going to quarantine it,\nI'm going to remove it.\n\n550\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.910\nAnd you can see now here\nthat it says clear.\n\n551\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:22.830\nIt's a clean system.\n\n552\n00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.510\nOne of the, one of the last things I would\nprobably mention with, Windows Defender,\n\n553\n00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.570\nand you might have to worry about this\nin some other security software here.\n\n554\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.920\nI want to go back to the tools and\nthen the options.\n\n555\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.900\nAnd then I want to go to,\nlet's, oh no, history.\n\n556\n00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.040\nExcuse me,\nI'm on the wrong side of the river here.\n\n557\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.505\nNotice I don't have any\ninformation in here.\n\n558\n00:26:42.505 --> 00:26:43.260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n559\n00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.280\n>> Windows Defender and I know this at\nleast specifically for Windows Defender.\n\n560\n00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.740\nWindows Defender by default\ndoesn't show you the history.\n\n561\n00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.430\nYou have to be an administrator and\n\n562\n00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.130\nyou can kind of see that down\nhere by the view button right.\n\n563\n00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.110\nWhy is that?\n\n564\n00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.380\nWell it lets you know that it protects\nyour other users for privacy.\n\n565\n00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.250\nSo there could potentially be I\ndon't know why we don't want to\n\n566\n00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.585\nlet the other users know that\nyou're watching them, I guess.\n\n567\n00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:10.190\n[LAUGH] But there could be\npotential privacy information so\n\n568\n00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.010\nit does require administrative effort.\n\n569\n00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.280\nNow what I did beforehand,\nMike, is I went ahead and\n\n570\n00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.840\nI made it look a little bit more like\nmaybe it's a heavily infected system.\n\n571\n00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.150\nNow guys, like I said,\nit's all the same file.\n\n572\n00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.870\nBut this is really no different\nthan what you would find\n\n573\n00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.230\nif you did have a system that\nyou were trying to remediate.\n\n574\n00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.480\nYou might find one more than one.\n\n575\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.010\nAnd notice the severe level,\nnotice that they've been removed.\n\n576\n00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.460\nThe dates, except for this error one,\n\n577\n00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.090\nthat was the first one,\nI kind of air-balled on that one.\n\n578\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.210\n[LAUGH] And then then the last one it says\nsucceeds, succeeds, succeeds, succeeds,\n\n579\n00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.430\nand that's what we want.\n\n580\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.870\nAnd hopefully we've got success.\n\n581\n00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.390\nWe've remediate the systems there Mike and\nwe're good to go.\n\n582\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.650\nWe've got a clean system and hopefully our\nnetworks aren't going to fail on us, or\n\n583\n00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.880\nat least our operating systems.\n\n584\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.200\n>> Very good.\nWell there you go.\n\n585\n00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.060\nWe got a lot of great\ninformation there and\n\n586\n00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.250\nagain we see that\nthe anti virus solutions,\n\n587\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.310\nthey don't have to be enterprise level and\na whole lot of money, right.\n\n588\n00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.750\nThere are versions that we can use\nin our home, in our small offices.\n\n589\n00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:08.980\nThey might be paid, they might be free.\n\n590\n00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.770\nThey might not have all the bells and\nwhistles and\n\n591\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.060\nthe centralized administration that we'd\nget from an enterprise level solution,\n\n592\n00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.100\nbut we don't need that.\n\n593\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.620\nI've got two computers at the house.\n\n594\n00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.650\nI've got five in my little Soho.\n\n595\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.520\nSo I can afford to go from\nmachine to machine and\n\n596\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.800\nconfigure those guys because of\nthe free or the lower price on that.\n\n597\n00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.610\nSo you're not left alone out\nthere if you're a consumer,\n\n598\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.170\nlots of good solutions\nto help keep us safe.\n\n599\n00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:32.590\nAnd understanding the different options.\n\n600\n00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:38.150\nWes, thank you for showing us around a\ntypical consumer grade antivirus solution.\n\n601\n00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.550\n>> Absolutely, it's been great man.\n\n602\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.060\n>> Any parting words for our viewers?\n\n603\n00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.200\n>> No, just whatever solution you choose,\njust make sure that you have security.\n\n604\n00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.560\nBecause even just a little bit\nof security can go a long way.\n\n605\n00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.680\nIt's better than nothing.\n\n606\n00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.560\n>> Very good.\n\n607\n00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.990\nAlright, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n608\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.460\nSigning off for IT PRO TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n609\n00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.160\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n610\n00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.389\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n611\n00:28:55.389 --> 00:29:01.450\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

host,\n\n3\n00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:19.219\nRonnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking that the antivirus and\n\n4\n00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.861\nanti-malware solutions that\nare also out there for\n\n5\n00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:24.805\nus as we actually are working\non different computers, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:28.588\ntoday we're taking something that's\nfairly special which, of course,\n\n7\n00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:32.852\nis going to be the Norton security and\nanti-virus solution that's also out there,\n\n8\n00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:35.780\nand who better to help us out than Mr.\nWes Bryan?\n\n9\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.910\nWes, out of all the security tools today\nwe've chosen actually to take a look at,\n\n10\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.140\nlike what we said here, the Symantec,\nNorton type of solution.\n\n11\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810\nWhat is it that we really need to know?\n\n12\n00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.730\n>> Yeah very good.\n\n13\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.690\nSo we've been talking about, as we've\nmoved on through this series and some past\n\n14\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.920\nepisodes, and if you haven't seen it\ndefinitely go back and check it out.\n\n15\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.440\nWe've been talking about consumer\ngrade antivirus software.\n\n16\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.430\nAnd that's where we've\nreally been focusing in on.\n\n17\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.380\nWe've mentioned things like signature\nbased, heuristic based, and\n\n18\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.320\nbehavioral based scanning.\n\n19\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.070\nNow we wanna get into a specific.\n\n20\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.850\nAnd just like Ronnie mentioned,\nwe're gonna take a look at some of these\n\n21\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.580\nconsumer grade antivirus\nsoftware that's out there, and\n\n22\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.010\nin this episode we'll be\nlooking at Norton Security.\n\n23\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.890\nSo I tell you what, let's go ahead and\ndive right in rather than talk about it,\n\n24\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.200\nlet's show you it.\n\n25\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.320\nSo the first thing you wanna know is\na little bit about the installer and\n\n26\n00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.380\nwhat you're gonna go through when you\ndo the installation process here.\n\n27\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.270\nNow, as the installation\nstarts it's really like no,\n\n28\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.650\nit's really no different I should\nsay than any other installer.\n\n29\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.900\nNow one of the first things\nyou're gonna see is this opt in,\n\n30\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.860\nopt out where it says join\nthis Norton community watch.\n\n31\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.070\nWell, let me tell you a little\nbit about what that is.\n\n32\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.510\nWith most of these, any malware software,\n\n33\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.570\nthey wanna be aware that, not just\na community base, but the companies,\n\n34\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.360\nthey wanna try to be aware of\nwhen zero-day exploits go out.\n\n35\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.150\nUnknown viruses,\nwe talked about the polymorphic virus and\n\n36\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.670\nchanging and as we also know there's\nalways these new viruses coming out.\n\n37\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.190\nWe had somebody mention\nsomething like 350,000\n\n38\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.010\npotential threats are scanned a week.\n\n39\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.520\nRight?\n\n40\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.800\nWell, what this is saying,\n\n41\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.060\nit's an opted in to send that\ninformation outbound to collect it.\n\n42\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.755\nAnd then also use the information\nacross the Norton community for\n\n43\n00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:20.930\nknown viruses, unknown viruses.\n\n44\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.410\nSo what are the things\nthat this setting does,\n\n45\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.710\nit says you're going to\nsend information outbound.\n\n46\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.780\nBut it can also help you out by\npotentially, you know, unknown viruses,\n\n47\n00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.750\nzero day exploits, and keeping you\na little bit more secure with that.\n\n48\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.350\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna leave it checked.\n\n49\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.150\nNow the other things we have,\nis we have the privacy policies down here.\n\n50\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.350\nWe've got some of the third-party\nnotices as well, and\n\n51\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.140\nyou can always check out those privacy\npolicies because we know they're fun.\n\n52\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.970\nThe other one is the install options.\n\n53\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.640\nNow, with the install options here\nwe're not really doing much there but\n\n54\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.900\nchanging where the default location is and\nyou've probably seen this\n\n55\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.200\nnot just in anti-virus but\nany program that you install,\n\n56\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.820\nif you want to change the default\nlocation where it's installed, you can.\n\n57\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.120\nSo, so far fairly easy and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.990\nagree and\nwe're gonna start through the installer.\n\n59\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.220\nNow again so\n\n60\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.080\nfar you'll see that this installer\nprocess really isn't too difficult.\n\n61\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.930\nAnd it could take a few minutes, and\n\n62\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.530\nit offers you a lot more when\nwe talk about anti-virus.\n\n63\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.060\nWe've talked about anti-malware.\n\n64\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.530\nYou don't have to get all these\ndifferent components today.\n\n65\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.170\nHave one for your anti-virus, one for\nyour spyware, one for adware.\n\n66\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.490\nOne for things like web monitoring right?\n\n67\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.870\nIt's usually all built into one package.\n\n68\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.110\nNow whatever the features are,\n\n69\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.170\nare going to be specific to\nwhatever you're buying here.\n\n70\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.080\nBut I can tell you right now this\none has a lot of different stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.440\nFirewall protection, email protection,\nidentity protection.\n\n72\n00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.900\nThings like passwords right?\n\n73\n00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.525\nWe talk about password managers and\n\n74\n00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:45.800\nmaking it a little bit easier for\nyou to manage passwords.\n\n75\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.870\nSo they've got things like\npassword managers in here too.\n\n76\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.573\nNow, one of the interesting things is,\n\n77\n00:03:50.573 --> 00:03:52.686\nyou can see that it says\nTurn Windows Defender on.\n\n78\n00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:57.406\nBecause what this software,\nwhat you're allowing it to do is you're\n\n79\n00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:00.609\nallowing it to configure\nyour anti-malware.\n\n80\n00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.650\nSo Windows Defender has\nbeen turned off and\n\n81\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.540\nright away our Action Center is saying,\nhey, there's a problem here.\n\n82\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.080\nWe don't find any anti-malware\nsoftware on here, so\n\n83\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.390\nyou need to do something about it.\n\n84\n00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.160\nNow, understand I've already\ncreated this account beforehand so\n\n85\n00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.040\nwe didn't have to go with\nthe account creation.\n\n86\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.090\nSo, if you haven't created your account,\nyou're gonna have to do that beforehand.\n\n87\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.050\nAnd once that's done, it'll go through,\nit'll activate your product.\n\n88\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.970\nOnce the activation's done it then\ngives you the ability to start using\n\n89\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.130\nthe interface.\n\n90\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.330\nNow, Ronnie I could tell you, not really\ntoo difficult here on the install.\n\n91\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.560\nIt'll give you this\nwalkthrough tour if you want.\n\n92\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.980\nI'm gonna do the tour for you here so\nI'm gonna go ahead and skip it.\n\n93\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.870\nBut you can see Ronnie here, fairly easy.\n\n94\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.480\nThe installer didn't take too much to get\nit installed and get it up and running.\n\n95\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.550\n>> The nice thing about what we see right\nhere is a fairly user friendly interface,\n\n96\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.300\nwhich after the basic installation, which\nmost people are gonna be able to walk\n\n97\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.960\nthrough and follow the instructions,\nit really does have very few options.\n\n98\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.240\nAnd so, that's probably something that end\nusers are really gonna appreciate, that\n\n99\n00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.330\nthey're not having to pick nine times out\nof ten what's actually gonna be installed.\n\n100\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.750\nEssentially and Norton have chosen what\nthey believe the basic options are gonna\n\n101\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.550\nneed to be for most consumer gradement\nof machines such as my own desktop here\n\n102\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.820\nthat I would choose to run as well.\n\n103\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.510\nAnd that means that once\neverything's turned on it will help\n\n104\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.300\nto protect the entire system.\n\n105\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.390\nAnd then more than likely,\n\n106\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.530\nI can go back and choose what I\nwanna turn off at a later date.\n\n107\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.200\nSo it's a great little installer, and\n\n108\n00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.983\nI like the big,\ngigantic icons that we saw right there.\n\n109\n00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:30.410\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n>> Because it makes it easy for\n\n110\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.110\nme to kind of key in on and\n\n111\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.040\nsee, and be able to decide\nwhat I'm actually looking for.\n\n112\n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.400\n>> Yeah, in fact, Ronnie and I,\nwe were talking before the show.\n\n113\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.180\nWe were mentioning that exact thing,\nthat the interface in some of these,\n\n114\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.090\nthey've kind of cleaned them up and\nthey've streamlined them.\n\n115\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.780\nIt makes it easier.\n\n116\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.420\nYou don't have to be a rocket scientist\nto be able to get in here and\n\n117\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.250\nwork with these.\n\n118\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.170\nSo let's go ahead and walk you through\nsome of the configurations that\n\n119\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.990\nyou can do and kind of give you\na walk through the product here.\n\n120\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.950\nNow we can go to settings, and\nif you go to settings we're going\n\n121\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.240\nlook at these individually,\nsome of these settings.\n\n122\n00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.490\nOne by one so notice the advance settings,\nthey got all these different options.\n\n123\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.798\nAnd that can become a little\nbit overwhelming right.\n\n124\n00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:10.730\nThat's not as quite as easy as\nlooking at these kind of like a tile.\n\n125\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.340\nSo that's why we're gonna go ahead,\nremember the settings you can do.\n\n126\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.250\nFrom that little gear icon, but it's just\nas easy to do the settings from here.\n\n127\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.630\nOne of the first things that we wanna,\n\n128\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.280\nwhen we think about antivirus\nis how do we run scans, right.\n\n129\n00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.650\nIf we're gonna, I mean,\nthat's the purpose of having an antivirus,\n\n130\n00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.540\nyou want to make sure\nthat you are protected.\n\n131\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.200\nNow if you get into the security tab,\nor security tile,\n\n132\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.650\nlet me show you something else, too.\n\n133\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.750\nYou can also collapse these, right.\n\n134\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.660\nIf you want to see what's behind door\nnumber one before you get there,\n\n135\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.890\nessentially if I just click security,\nit's gonna drop that list down.\n\n136\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.560\nSo if you get familiar with the interface,\nand you already know where you need to go,\n\n137\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.600\nyou might not want this\ntile interface right here.\n\n138\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.880\nBut either way, if I click this,\nit just removes that, and now you can see,\n\n139\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.280\nlike I said,\nkind of what's behind the curtains.\n\n140\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.190\nNow, one of the first things I want\nto look at is the scans themselves.\n\n141\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.330\nAnd we'll show you exactly\nhow to run a scan, but\n\n142\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.230\nI want to talk about some of the different\nscans that you have available to you.\n\n143\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.470\nNow, if we look at some of these scans, it\nwill scan a lot of different options here.\n\n144\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.360\nRight.\nWe can see things like our full scans.\n\n145\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.250\nYou know, our custom scans.\n\n146\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.660\nCustom tasks, as well.\n\n147\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.450\nNow, the custom tasks have to do with\nsome of the other functionality in this\n\n148\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.200\nsoftware.\n\n149\n00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.170\nYou can say hey, if I wanna\ncheck performance on a computer,\n\n150\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.170\nlet's schedule that task to\nrun that performance check.\n\n151\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.770\nThat's really all that is, but\nwe're gonna focus on the scans themselves.\n\n152\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.140\nThe other thing that's kinda cool,\nare you in social media?\n\n153\n00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.400\nIt's hard to say that most people aren't\nat some point in some kind of social\n\n154\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.930\nmedia today.\n\n155\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.110\nSo this will do things like\nscanning your Facebook,\n\n156\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.770\nit'll also give you diagnostics as well.\n\n157\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.830\nSo fairly simple so far.\n\n158\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.080\nBut if you choose a quick scan, all right\nthe quick scan and let me go ahead and\n\n159\n00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.560\njust kind of pause this here so\nit's not bogging down the CPU.\n\n160\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.531\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:56.045\nQuick scan is gonna do kind of like\nwhat we talked about before in some of\n\n162\n00:07:56.045 --> 00:07:59.276\nthe other episodes that it's\ngonna just Scan the common areas.\n\n163\n00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:04.980\nThere's characteristics of certain viruses\nor a commonality of those characteristics.\n\n164\n00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.840\nWhere do they infect?\n\n165\n00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.760\nWhere do they go?\n\n166\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.500\nThey're gonna go down to the registry.\n\n167\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.060\nMaybe if you're in Windows,\nmaybe the Windows System 32 folder and\n\n168\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.120\nyou're gonna see areas there.\n\n169\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.070\nIf you're in the user profile.\n\n170\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.670\nVery well could be right\nin the temporary files,\n\n171\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.840\nthe user temporary files where they\ncan stash some of that information.\n\n172\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.210\nSo, that's exactly what it's gonna do.\n\n173\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.240\nIt'll look at some of the common areas.\n\n174\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.585\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and just stop this,\n\n175\n00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:32.810\ncuz I wanna show you a couple of the other\noptions you have with your scans.\n\n176\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:38.670\nNow if we go back to run scans, full scans\nguys, here is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n177\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.220\nIt's not gonna pick and choose.\n\n178\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.020\nIt's gonna say any storage location\nthat is on this computer right now,\n\n179\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.520\nincluding removable devices,\ngo ahead and just run it all, right?\n\n180\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.900\nSo, pretty easy on that one.\n\n181\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.760\nBut one of the ones that might not be\nquite as easy is the customized scan.\n\n182\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.380\nNow, It's really not any different\nthan some of the other software here.\n\n183\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.950\nNow we can pick and choose.\n\n184\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.580\nAnd when you pick and\nchoose, if you go ahead and\n\n185\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.000\nsay go, this is a little bit different,\nright, than what we think about before.\n\n186\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.780\nYou say well wait a second, this looks\nlike a full scan and quick scan.\n\n187\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.860\nWell, what is this?\n\n188\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.450\nWell, these are actually Scan Options.\n\n189\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.850\nThese are scans that have been created so\nthat makes it easier.\n\n190\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.180\nYou wanna do a customized scan,\nyou essentially have to create it.\n\n191\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:22.970\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n192\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.340\nLet's create a scan.\n\n193\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.580\nNow it's gonna ask me here if I\nwant to create a scan, right?\n\n194\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.250\nWhat folder, files, drives might I\nwanna use or include in this scan?\n\n195\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.590\nAll right, so I'll just go ahead,\nlet's say, Add Drives.\n\n196\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.270\nAnd maybe I want to add local disc C.\n\n197\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.380\nNow, if you do the full scan you\ndon't have to go through all this.\n\n198\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.320\nBut, who knows.\n\n199\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.210\nYou might have multiple drives\nwithin your system, right?\n\n200\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.650\nYou might plug in an external USB drive\n\n201\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.785\nthat might not be included\nin the custom scan.\n\n202\n00:09:50.785 --> 00:09:55.275\nBut understand, once we have\nselected that, we can go ahead and\n\n203\n00:09:55.275 --> 00:09:57.805\nchoose Next and\nthen it asks us about scheduling and\n\n204\n00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.025\nI'll show you scheduling coming up\nhere a little bit more in-depth.\n\n205\n00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:03.085\nNow it's kind of\ninteresting too down here.\n\n206\n00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:06.365\nIt talks about running the scan\nonly at idle time, right,\n\n207\n00:10:06.365 --> 00:10:07.755\nbecause it's CPU intensive.\n\n208\n00:10:07.755 --> 00:10:10.385\nAny time we're having to\nsearch information, right,\n\n209\n00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:12.315\nit's gonna bog down the CPU.\n\n210\n00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:15.450\nAnd if you've got a line of business\nsoftware that you're currently using\n\n211\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.860\nmaybe it's something like Photoshop,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.310\nPhotoshop takes a lot of resources.\n\n213\n00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.225\nAnd if you're in the middle of doing,\nor media encoding, right?\n\n214\n00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:24.050\nThat's pretty resource intensive,\npretty CPU intensive.\n\n215\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.530\nAnd I might not want this scan in the\nmiddle of a line of business app that I'm\n\n216\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.610\ntrying to use.\n\n217\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.910\nRunning and bogging down that app.\n\n218\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.850\nSo again, fairly easy here.\n\n219\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.490\nAnd I'm going to say Run.\n\n220\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.390\nI'll tell you what we'll do this one run\ndaily and we'll just keep it at 1:50 P.M.\n\n221\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.280\nwe'll just keep the defaults.\n\n222\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.362\nNow, the next thing it does is it asks\nwhat do you want the options to be?\n\n223\n00:10:45.362 --> 00:10:46.900\nAll right, if you're gonna run a scan and\n\n224\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.430\nI do find something,\nwhat do you want to do with it, right?\n\n225\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.820\nRemove the infected folder?\n\n226\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.650\nThat's not what I have.\n\n227\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.310\nI say ask me first, right?\n\n228\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.490\nAsk me.\n\n229\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.070\nBecause remember,\n\n230\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.760\nsometimes when we're using heuristics like\nwe talked about behavioral based scanning,\n\n231\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.510\nthere's false positives and\nif I apply a default action to this and\n\n232\n00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.520\nI am using something like Heuristics and\nit flags a file that a program needs and\n\n233\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.660\nit's a legitimate program,\nit can quarantine and then erase it.\n\n234\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.650\nAnd then we have have problems\nwith our operating system,\n\n235\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.740\nwe have problems with that application\nthat we need, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.320\nsay quarantine it so it doesn't hurt\nour system, but then go ahead and\n\n237\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.000\nlet me choose what we're gonna do here.\n\n238\n00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.820\nAll right?\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n239\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.270\nchoose Save, oh I gotta,\ngotta enter a name here.\n\n240\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.180\nSo, we'll just call this My Scan and\nsee if we can identify it.\n\n241\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.140\nRemember, the names are arbitrary,\nbut just we talked about with things\n\n242\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.940\nlike firewalls and rules which create, you\nwanna be able to identify it fairly easy.\n\n243\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.510\nSo down here, I can say, My Scan, and\nif I wanted to, I could run that.\n\n244\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.630\nSo, fairly easy if you are running scans.\n\n245\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:53.130\nIt's a fairly easy process to do that,\nespecially your customized scans.\n\n246\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.880\nNow one of the other things\nthat we need to think about is\n\n247\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.940\nupdating your software, all right?\n\n248\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.230\nRemember we talked about your anti-malware\nanti-virus solution is only as\n\n249\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.540\ngood as what it's aware of.\n\n250\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.530\nOf course, unless you're using Heuristics\nand then it can do unknowns and\n\n251\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.000\nbehavioral based, but\nstill it needs to be updated.\n\n252\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.890\nSo they've got this technology\ncalled Live Update.\n\n253\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.570\nNow again, the names might change\na little bit from computer to computer.\n\n254\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.680\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nI'm not gonna cancel this.\n\n255\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.370\nWe'll go ahead and let it do an update.\n\n256\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.990\nAnd you can see it's running through\nsome updates fairly quickly here.\n\n257\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.300\nAnd what it's doing is it's\nreaching out to Symantec and\n\n258\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.550\nit's saying I've noticed that this update,\nor this database, right?\n\n259\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.270\nIt does a versioning comparison of\nthe metadata on the database that's here.\n\n260\n00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.370\nAnd it says I can see\nthat you're out of date.\n\n261\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.090\nSo since you're out of date and\nyou chose to do the update, or\n\n262\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.410\nchosen to do the update,\nlet me go ahead and pull those down.\n\n263\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.950\nAnd it looks like it's completed and\nit goes through the installing process.\n\n264\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.060\nSo fairly easy.\n\n265\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.110\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nminimize this and we'll move into history.\n\n266\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:57.530\nWhat if you find a piece of tech,\nor a piece of malware, right?\n\n267\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.800\nYou want to know if, you found it or not.\n\n268\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.080\nYou want to know what\nthis system is doing.\n\n269\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.610\nWell guess what?\n\n270\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.900\nIt's got full detail here, all right?\n\n271\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.290\nAnd it's telling you what\nthe activities are, as well.\n\n272\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.080\nBut notice it's also monitoring itself.\n\n273\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.090\nIt's just not monitoring your system,\nit's monitoring what it's doing as well so\n\n274\n00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.490\nthat it can give you a full report,\n\n275\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.840\nnot just on what it finds like a lot of\nthe common AD malware software will do.\n\n276\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.670\nIt'll tell you that,\n\n277\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.220\nhey look, I'm running an intrusion\nprevention system technology on this.\n\n278\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.310\nAnd it lets me know that\nthat information is there.\n\n279\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.740\nSo you get the ability to get\na pretty good, detailed list.\n\n280\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.800\nLet's see if we can scroll\ndown to get anything but info.\n\n281\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.100\nOkay, all right.\n\n282\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.920\nHere's one.\n\n283\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.440\nNow, I've selected it over here and\nit's let me know that, hey,\n\n284\n00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.480\nthis is a medium-level threat, but\n\n285\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.310\nwhen I look over to the side here it tells\nme that it's the system 32 folder, right?\n\n286\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.840\nAnd this very well could be\na process that we want to run.\n\n287\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.790\nSo that's one of the reasons kind of\ngoing back to what do I want the default\n\n288\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.460\nactions to be.\n\n289\n00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.430\nDo I want something to, do I want this\ntechnology to remove that's in the system\n\n290\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.410\nthirty two folder before I have\na chance to actually see it?\n\n291\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.550\nWell probably not.\n\n292\n00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.150\nSo you do have the ability there Ronnie.\n\n293\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.870\nA couple of cool things that you can\ndo when you're configuring scans and\n\n294\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.755\nseeing the information go back to it.\n\n295\n00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:14.460\nAnd If I've contracted a virus on this or\n\n296\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.970\nhave some other piece of malware,\nat least let me know.\n\n297\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.090\nSo, fairly easy when it\ncomes to setting up.\n\n298\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.210\nAnd kind of like you mentioned, Ronnie,\nthe tile interface is really intuitive.\n\n299\n00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.150\nIt's not too complex.\n\n300\n00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.720\nYou just have to know where you're\ngoing to be able to set it up.\n\n301\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.900\n>> It seems like a pretty decent product,\nwe actually see a lot of features\n\n302\n00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.550\njust in the basic setup that we didn't\nreally have to configure too much.\n\n303\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.430\nBut there's actually more that we can do,\nthere's at technology for\n\n304\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.020\na semantic that they call SONAR?\n\n305\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.830\nWhat's that about?\n\n306\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.010\n>> That's right,\nnow SONAR is kind of interesting.\n\n307\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.270\nIt's a crazy acronym.\n\n308\n00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.140\nIt's the Semantic Online Network for\nAdvanced Response.\n\n309\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.550\nBoy, I can't even say that once.\n\n310\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.540\nDon't even try to say that so\nmany times in a row.\n\n311\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.270\nNow, what is this?\n\n312\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.770\nThis is kind of like a cross between\nHeuristics based scanning and\n\n313\n00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.200\nbehavioral based scanning.\n\n314\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.820\nAnd what it does if you're using that\ntechnology, is it will scan all of your\n\n315\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:09.490\nfiles and it will look for unknown\nactions, unknown processes, unknown files.\n\n316\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.470\nAnd remember as viruses come out,\n\n317\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.310\nit's hard to detect things\nlike zero date exploits.\n\n318\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.750\nRemember in another episode we\nestablished what a zero date exploit is.\n\n319\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.420\nGo back and check out that episode if\nyou're not familiar with the terminology.\n\n320\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.890\nBut remember if I don't know,\nthat a virus is here, I can't protect it.\n\n321\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.740\nIf that virus has never infected any\nother computer, how am I aware of it?\n\n322\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.310\nAnd that is one of the things that you\ncan see if you go into the more Advanced\n\n323\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.580\nsettings let's see anti-virus,\nand there we go.\n\n324\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.900\nIt is down here at the bottom.\n\n325\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.543\nNotice that it is a SONAR.\n\n326\n00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:47.401\nYou can configure different\naspects of this, but keep in mind,\n\n327\n00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:52.619\nit says remove risks, advanced mode, and\nremember when we talked about Heuristics,\n\n328\n00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:56.548\ntalking about a likelihood Right,\nand one of the mechanisms that\n\n329\n00:15:56.548 --> 00:16:01.470\nheuristics uses is not only string\nsearches, but it uses probability.\n\n330\n00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:06.340\nAnd it says, let me compare the actions\nof this with what I already know, and\n\n331\n00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.120\nlet me determine if the probability\nis that it, you know,\n\n332\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.380\nthe likelihood that it is a virus.\n\n333\n00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.950\nNow, we've got this set\nto high probability.\n\n334\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.540\nIt means I'm not guessing.\n\n335\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.830\nWell, I'm still kind of guessing,\nbut I'm almost positive.\n\n336\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.530\nYou know when it looks like a duck,\nit's walking like a duck, it's quacking,\n\n337\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.490\nchances are it pretty much is a duck.\n\n338\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.150\nSo you can set this a little bit lower.\n\n339\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.710\nNow the problem is as you set it lower,\nyou also increase your chance for\n\n340\n00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.070\nfalse positives, right.\n\n341\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.620\nIf I have this up to a high level of\ncertainty then, doesn't mean that I'm\n\n342\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.090\ngonna be immune to false positives,\nbut it does kind of reduce the risk.\n\n343\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.180\nSo sonar is a really good\ntechnology to turn on.\n\n344\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.540\nYou just have to know where it is.\n\n345\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.050\nAnd I'll tell you what, let's do that one\nmore time so you guys know where that is.\n\n346\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.330\nAgain, you're gonna go to\nthe little gear icon, settings.\n\n347\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.980\nAnd then you're gonna go to antivirus.\n\n348\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.350\nAnd then right here on the automatic\nprotection tab it gives you the ability to\n\n349\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.950\ngo ahead and turn sonar on and\noff if you want.\n\n350\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:03.250\nNow, that really, in totality,\nwhen you're talking about some of\n\n351\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.530\nthe basic functionality,\nthat is how we configure a scan.\n\n352\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.110\nSome of our advanced options that\nwe can do with configuring a scan,\n\n353\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.890\nremember the custom scan, you're gonna\ntell it where you want it to scan,\n\n354\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.180\nthe full scan, scans everything.\n\n355\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.870\nKeep in mind the confrontational power,\nwhen you turn on things like sonar, right,\n\n356\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.625\nyou're saying the what if scenario.\n\n357\n00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:27.745\nAlso remember that high probability or\n\n358\n00:17:27.745 --> 00:17:31.355\nhigh certainty level means you're gonna\nreduce the risk of false positives.\n\n359\n00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:34.585\nIf you reduce it to medium,\nthen you increase your chance.\n\n360\n00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:35.765\nI mean, there's always pros and cons.\n\n361\n00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:38.705\nWith everything we talk around here,\nthere's always pros and cons, right?\n\n362\n00:17:38.705 --> 00:17:42.225\nIf you add convenience,\na lot of time you reduce security.\n\n363\n00:17:42.225 --> 00:17:44.505\nWell, this is one of the ones that yes,\n\n364\n00:17:44.505 --> 00:17:50.250\nif you do lower the setting you\nincrease your risks of false positives.\n\n365\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.460\nBut you could potentially increase\nthe likelihood of catching a virus before\n\n366\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.190\nanybody knows it.\n\n367\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.350\nAnd I don't mean catching guys, so\nyou don't want to catch the virus,\n\n368\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.820\nhow about we rephrase that and\nsay quarantine the virus,\n\n369\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.230\nstop it in its tracks.\n\n370\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.656\nSo really good things here Ronnie, fairly\nintuitive, it's not too easy, just know\n\n371\n00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:09.210\nwhere the settings are, know exactly what\nyou're configuring and you should be good.\n\n372\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.244\n>> Now even though we're really focusing\nin on anti-virus and anti-malware,\n\n373\n00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:17.230\nthere's a lot of times like the security\nsuite we're looking at right here.\n\n374\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.234\nIt includes beyond things\nlike that to help us out for\n\n375\n00:18:20.234 --> 00:18:23.035\nsomebody setting this up\non their own computer,\n\n376\n00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:27.030\ntrying to make sure that they\nhave the security that they need.\n\n377\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.190\nAnd Wes, I actually see several\noptions right there, so\n\n378\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.700\nlet's talk about a few\nof those options too.\n\n379\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.370\n>> Definitely.\n\n380\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.240\nOne of the things that you probably had,\n\n381\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.560\nmaybe you have software\nout there that does this.\n\n382\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.810\nOne of the things that comes to mind,\nright, is LastPass.\n\n383\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.580\nSomebody is probably using LastPass\nout there watching this right now.\n\n384\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.450\nIn fact I know I do.\n\n385\n00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.880\nI'm not sure if you do, Ronnie.\n\n386\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.050\nA lot of us use it today, right?\n\n387\n00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.100\nWhat is it?\n\n388\n00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.600\nIt's a password banager, right?\n\n389\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.560\nIt helps us to implement signal sign\non but at the same time it's a password\n\n390\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.180\nmanager and it's controlling things\nlike filling out forms for us.\n\n391\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.800\nWell guess what?\n\n392\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.020\nWe also have that right here.\n\n393\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.060\nI can go to the identity tab or\n\n394\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.450\nidentity tile if you will,\nand I've got some options.\n\n395\n00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.920\nIdentity safe is like a vault for\nyour different identities, usernames, and\n\n396\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.080\npasswords.\n\n397\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.940\nI can also go to the ID settings.\n\n398\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.830\nAnd if I choose ID settings,\n\n399\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.660\nthis is kind of cool is the fact that\nit can do things like anti fishing.\n\n400\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800\nBlocking malicious web pages.\n\n401\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.070\nA lot of this is built in by\nthe way to the web browsers.\n\n402\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.220\nBut it's you know, always good to\nhave a layered defense system.\n\n403\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.510\nYou know to make sure that it's tracking.\n\n404\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.610\nYou know like a reputation database.\n\n405\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.760\nIt looks at the URL that\nyou're browsing to.\n\n406\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.680\nAnd it sends that information\nout to Semantic and\n\n407\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.190\nit says can I trust this website?\n\n408\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.230\nWell, if it's not found in\nthat reputation database,\n\n409\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.210\nit means most likely the website is safe.\n\n410\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.770\nCuz the reputation database doesn't\nmean I have a good reputation,\n\n411\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.140\nit means I have a reputation for\npropagating malware,\n\n412\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.460\npropagating phishing scams,\nstealing your browser and\n\n413\n00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.000\nredirecting you somewhere else, so\nit's good to have this information.\n\n414\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.250\nThe other thing that I like about this\nis the password generator all right.\n\n415\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.120\nThe password generator,\nwhen you use it, does exactly that.\n\n416\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.640\nYou can, and\nI think it's gonna connect outbound.\n\n417\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.340\nWe can let it connect cuz I really\nwant to show you guys this.\n\n418\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.180\nAnd it also asks you if you wanna add\nextensions to your web browsers to\n\n419\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.250\nhelp you, but notice what you can do here.\n\n420\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.810\nAnd tell you what, let me get that out\nof there so you guys, there we go, so\n\n421\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:13.960\nyou guys can see that.\n\n422\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.850\nI want a password length.\n\n423\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.630\nI want to create a complex password.\n\n424\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.980\nWe got episodes in security that\nwalk about password management and\n\n425\n00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.120\nstrengthening your passwords.\n\n426\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.740\nMaybe you as an end user don't know\nexactly what makes a complex password.\n\n427\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.430\nBut you want to make\nsure that it's secure.\n\n428\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.000\nWell, if you come in here,\nyou can tell the characteristics and\n\n429\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.430\nthe character length that you want, right.\n\n430\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.190\nMaybe you want a ten-character password.\n\n431\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.790\nYou want it to include upper, lowercase\nletters, so punctuation if you will,\n\n432\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.690\nwhich is what it says here,\ninclude punctuation, uppercase, lowercase.\n\n433\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.210\nYou wanna include numbers.\n\n434\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.480\nYou wanna include special characters.\n\n435\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.000\nRemember, exponentially increasing\n\n436\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.820\nthe computational power that\nit takes crack the password.\n\n437\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.850\nNice to have that here.\n\n438\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.620\nSo when it comes to the identity\nmanagement, it's really cool.\n\n439\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.180\nAnd then you also see statistics too.\n\n440\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.260\nThis is another one here.\n\n441\n00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.560\nNow, I haven't stored\nany information in here.\n\n442\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.530\nBut let's just see that it says addresses\nstored, assistants, log in stored, and\n\n443\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.260\nit's telling me they're all greenlighted.\n\n444\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.430\nWhich means they're safe.\n\n445\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.850\nNow let's just be careful with that.\n\n446\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.600\nI don't have any information so\nof course it's safe.\n\n447\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.640\nIt's always safe if you're\nnot storing it there, right?\n\n448\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.110\nAnd I could set that up as well.\n\n449\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.630\nSo when it comes to\nthe identity management,\n\n450\n00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.780\nthat is one of the good things to have.\n\n451\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.850\nNow one of the other things that we\nalso have here that I really like,\n\n452\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.320\nbacking up your system.\n\n453\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.970\nNow, I'm in Windows 7 here and Window's\ndoes have some onboard backup utilities.\n\n454\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.480\nSo you can use those as well but if\nyou've already paid for the software and\n\n455\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.450\nyou've got it built in,\nwhy not just go to the backups.\n\n456\n00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.622\nYou can run your backups,\nyou can schedule your backups, you,\n\n457\n00:21:42.622 --> 00:21:45.090\nYou can restore files if you need to.\n\n458\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.380\nYou can add more storage, right.\n\n459\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.100\nYou can pay for it.\n\n460\n00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.630\nI mean, there's such so\nmuch competition out there for\n\n461\n00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.480\nonline file hosting solutions.\n\n462\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.020\nThis is no different, right.\n\n463\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.360\nI can pick which back up\nset I wanna restore from,\n\n464\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.400\nso really cool ways that you\ncan maintain your computer.\n\n465\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.480\nAnd speaking of maintaining your computer,\n\n466\n00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.450\none of the other things that you have\nis the performance tab all right.\n\n467\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.650\nIn the performance tab you have\nthings like disc defragmenter.\n\n468\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.140\nThey call it optimize disc here.\n\n469\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.610\nHow about temporary files?\n\n470\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.440\nInternet files, log files,\nwell you can choose this location, and\n\n471\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.290\nit's gonna run it.\n\n472\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.870\nLet me just go ahead and pause the scan\nhere so you guys can kind of see what's\n\n473\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.320\ngoing on here temporary files for\nthe operating system.\n\n474\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.710\nAnd internet files, right?\n\n475\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.570\nSo, we can remove those as well.\n\n476\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.870\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n477\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.710\nThere is onboard software that's\nbuilt into Windows that can do this.\n\n478\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.920\nBut, again this is\na total security sweep so\n\n479\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.340\nit's going to have that\nfunctionality as well.\n\n480\n00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.130\nAll right.\n\n481\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.040\nThe other too, as a start up manager,\nand when you look at this the start up\n\n482\n00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.130\nmanager's a lot like,\nin fact I can actually do this here.\n\n483\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.820\nLet's go ahead, Ronnie,\nI tell you what and kind of compare this.\n\n484\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.340\nYou know what?\n\n485\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.300\nI'm in a different operating system,\nMS config.\n\n486\n00:22:52.772 --> 00:22:53.860\nAll right, so,\n\n487\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.540\nif I launch MS config, notice that I've\ngot these startup options right here.\n\n488\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.370\nNow we're not really talking about\nanything that's much different,\n\n489\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.370\nbut now we're managing it\nall from a single interface.\n\n490\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.010\nSo that's one of the great things\nabout this, is that you do have that\n\n491\n00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.750\nunified interface that you could manage\nstartup there if you don't know how.\n\n492\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.680\nCuz think about it, right, the average\nend user might not use MSCONFIG,\n\n493\n00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.210\nprobably not even know\nthat MSCONFIG exists.\n\n494\n00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.330\nThis puts it right in front\nof your face and says,\n\n495\n00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.910\nhey you wanna manage the things that\nare starting up on your computer?\n\n496\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.920\nPotentially optimise the performance of\nyour boot time, then you can do that.\n\n497\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.420\nSo all really good stuff.\n\n498\n00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.120\nTell you what, Ronnie.\n\n499\n00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.120\nHow about let's infect this computer and\nsee if it actually works.\n\n500\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.651\n>> That would be interesting.\n\n501\n00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:32.484\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n502\n00:23:32.484 --> 00:23:34.031\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n503\n00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:36.360\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ninfect this computer.\n\n504\n00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.350\nNow understand guys,\nwhat I'm using here is the EICAR file.\n\n505\n00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.070\nEICAR files, and\nif you haven't seen those, guys.\n\n506\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.130\nThese are dedicated, they're gonna be\nseen as viruses but they're not viruses.\n\n507\n00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.050\nThey're used to test your\nanti-malware software.\n\n508\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.236\nIf your anti-malware software says\nit give you realtime protection.\n\n509\n00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:56.586\nYou can go out and you can download\nthis file to your computer.\n\n510\n00:23:56.586 --> 00:23:58.951\nAnd you could see if they're putting\ntheir money where their mouth is and\n\n511\n00:23:58.951 --> 00:24:00.010\ntest the real time protection.\n\n512\n00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.030\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n513\n00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.320\nWe'll see how many of these\nfiles I actually have to take\n\n514\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.770\nover here before it catches one.\n\n515\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.420\nSo, I put that itcar file,\nthat .com file and I'll go ahead and\n\n516\n00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.870\nput a zip folder over here.\n\n517\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.960\nAnd we'll give it a second.\n\n518\n00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.260\nWe'll see if the real time protection.\n\n519\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.670\nNow, it's in the middle of scanning right\nnow so what we might see is that, and\n\n520\n00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.540\nit's going to lock up the computer here,\nand we're going to go ahead,\n\n521\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.850\noh, looks like it's done it's updates.\n\n522\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.400\nLet's restart that\na little bit later here.\n\n523\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.490\nOh, there it is.\n\n524\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.508\nThere it is, so let me see if I can\nget in there before that disappears.\n\n525\n00:24:33.508 --> 00:24:38.120\nAll right, notice that.\n\n526\n00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.150\nLet me see if I can move that over there.\n\n527\n00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.120\nThat's got it right.\n\n528\n00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.530\nWhoa.\n\n529\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:48.050\nHopefully you guys took your\nmotion sickness pills out there.\n\n530\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.950\nBut what it's telling me\nif I view the details.\n\n531\n00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.120\nThere we go, that will be a little bit\neasier for you guys to see out there.\n\n532\n00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.500\nIs it says, I found that file.\n\n533\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.860\nI found that file, I seen it as\na virus and the details of it.\n\n534\n00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.950\nIt tells me that this is a virus thread.\n\n535\n00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.530\nNow one of the interesting things is\nif you follow what it's telling you,\n\n536\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:10.490\nit always gives you information about\nwhat it's taken, what it's quarantined.\n\n537\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.825\nAnd if you need to get\nadditional information, you can.\n\n538\n00:25:12.825 --> 00:25:17.745\nAnd one of the things that you'll see\nwhen, you see this EICAR Test String, and\n\n539\n00:25:17.745 --> 00:25:20.865\nyou go out to Semantic's website,\nthey're gonna let you know that it's not\n\n540\n00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:24.485\nactually a virus,\nthat it's only used for testing.\n\n541\n00:25:24.485 --> 00:25:25.045\nAll right?\n\n542\n00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:30.315\nIt'll tell you the source file, it'll tell\nyou what it's done, the file actions,\n\n543\n00:25:30.315 --> 00:25:34.335\nand more specifically, remember anything\nthat's seen with a severity level, a high\n\n544\n00:25:34.335 --> 00:25:38.340\nseverity level, most of your antivirus\nsoftware has a default action that says,\n\n545\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.290\nquarantine it, don't let it do anything,\nand then remove it.\n\n546\n00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:44.040\nNow you can change those actions from\nthe settings like I showed you, but\n\n547\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.000\nthat's really up to you\nif you want to do that.\n\n548\n00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.460\nSo, looks like our Symantec Norton\nAntivirus is working, Ronnie, and\n\n549\n00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.190\nhopefully we've got a clean computer.\n\n550\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.390\nI'm still kinda up in the air on if\nit's gonna find that file in that\n\n551\n00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.530\nzipped folder.\n\n552\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.430\nMost of your anti-virus software\ncan look in a zip folder and\n\n553\n00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.320\nsay I see a virus in there.\n\n554\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.780\nEven more so, it can go into another zip\nfolder, two layers in and say nuh-uh,\n\n555\n00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.730\nI caught it there too, so I would\nalmost be willing to bet that if I, oh,\n\n556\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.150\nit's letting me know my\nbrowsers not protected,\n\n557\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.060\nI would almost be willing to\nbet that if I let this run or\n\n558\n00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.460\nscheduled a scan right now it would\nfind it and it would quarantine it.\n\n559\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.290\nAnd hopefully my computer\nwill be a little more safe.\n\n560\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.192\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n561\n00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:27.984\nAs far as anti-malware and\nanti-virus goes,\n\n562\n00:26:27.984 --> 00:26:30.845\nthere's a lot of good\ninformation right there,\n\n563\n00:26:30.845 --> 00:26:35.729\nespecially if you're actually trying to\nmake a choice of which one you wanna pick,\n\n564\n00:26:35.729 --> 00:26:40.509\nand today you've actually shown us\nthe Semantic Norton anti-virus solution.\n\n565\n00:26:40.509 --> 00:26:43.467\nAnd we see that it's super feature rich,\nit makes it easy for\n\n566\n00:26:43.467 --> 00:26:46.290\nthe end-user to actually go ahead and\ninstall.\n\n567\n00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:51.230\nAnd then in the background, hopefully\nit is updating and what's also going on\n\n568\n00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.180\nis that we're actually having\nregular scheduled scans going on,\n\n569\n00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.720\njust like with everything else too.\n\n570\n00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.730\nNow are there any last little\nthings about the Norton solution\n\n571\n00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.180\nthat you would actually recommend?\n\n572\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.520\n>> Yeah, I would just make sure that you\nknow first of all, make sure that it's on.\n\n573\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.800\nIt doesn't help much if\nyou download the software.\n\n574\n00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.678\nWe've got good intentions, we download\nthe software then we don't use it.\n\n575\n00:27:11.678 --> 00:27:12.885\nMake sure you use it.\n\n576\n00:27:12.885 --> 00:27:16.400\nAnd make sure you run scans.\n\n577\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.900\nIf you don't run your scans regularly,\n\n578\n00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:23.110\nor schedule your scans, but when you're\nrunning it make sure that it's turned on.\n\n579\n00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.350\nIf you don't have the time.\n\n580\n00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.760\nEverybody gets busy.\n\n581\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.140\nSo if you don't have the time to\nimplement a scan, schedule the scan.\n\n582\n00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.630\nSchedule it for a specific time that\nyou're not in front of the computer but\n\n583\n00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.290\nyou'll know it'll be on.\n\n584\n00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.060\nIt won't interfere with your time,\nit won't ruin your productivity.\n\n585\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.540\nAnd you will stay safe.\n\n586\n00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.440\n>> Awesome.\n\n587\n00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.080\nThank you again Wes for that demonstration\non the Symantec Norton antivirus solution.\n\n588\n00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.140\nThank you for also watching us today.\n\n589\n00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.810\nWe're going to actually take this\nmoment here in time to go ahead and\n\n590\n00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.090\nalso end this episode, so signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n591\n00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.915\n>> Am I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n592\n00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:55.122\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n593\n00:27:55.122 --> 00:27:59.690\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.978\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\nwe're talking about antivirus and\n\n4\n00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:20.830\nanti-malware solutions.\n\n5\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.530\nWe're specifically going to be talking\nabout the McAfee Total Protection suite\n\n6\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.520\nthat's actually here to help us out.\n\n7\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.560\nAnd we have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.850\nHe's gonna actually be giving us\nessentially a guided tour on what we need\n\n9\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.550\nto know about this solution and whether or\nnot we're actually gonna pick it.\n\n10\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.180\nNow Wes you gotta answer me\na question right away here.\n\n11\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.610\nIs it actually McCafee or is it McCafee.\n\n12\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.370\n>> You know, McCafee.\n\n13\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.110\nI'm gonna try and say it because\nusually I say it wrong anyways.\n\n14\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.950\nIn fact a lot of times I don't even\nsay it write anyways I say McGaffey.\n\n15\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.837\nIt's actually McAfee or McAfee.\n\n16\n00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:57.490\nI'm going to meet in the middle here and\nsay I have no clue.\n\n17\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.020\nSo if you guys know out there,\nyou need to let us know.\n\n18\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.720\nSo that's what we are going\nto be looking at today.\n\n19\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.676\nWe're going to be looking moving\nalong in consumer grade software.\n\n20\n00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:10.060\nConsumer grade anti-virus software,\nlike Ronnie said, in today's episode we're\n\n21\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.390\nreally going to be looking at the McAfee\ntotal protection anti-virus software.\n\n22\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.330\nAnd again, keep in mind that this is\nconsumer grade, so I tell you what.\n\n23\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020\nLet's go ahead and rather than talk\nabout it, let's dive right in here and\n\n24\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.080\nshow you a little bit about this.\n\n25\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.000\nNow, one of the first things that\n\n26\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.010\nwe're gonna do is go through\nthe installation process.\n\n27\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.050\nNow, understand that I've gone ahead and\nalready downloaded the executable,\n\n28\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.970\nso you don't have to wait and see that.\n\n29\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.390\nBut remember,\nyou go to the manufacturer's website,\n\n30\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.480\nand on their website you'll be able to get\nthis executable if you wanna test it out\n\n31\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.860\nand try this software out for yourself.\n\n32\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.100\nGoing into the installation, for\nthe most part, it's not too difficult.\n\n33\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.690\nThis is gonna require\nan administrative level account.\n\n34\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.540\nA standard user's not gonna\nbe able to install that.\n\n35\n00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.415\nOne of the things we can see is that\nlittle shield on the executable.\n\n36\n00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:58.505\nNow, when you go through the installer,\nthis is one of these products that you\n\n37\n00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:02.565\nare gonna have to have an internet\nconnection in order to make it work.\n\n38\n00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:06.535\nAnd some of them you do have to have\nthat but some of them you don't have to,\n\n39\n00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:11.190\nit'll be really contingent on what\nthe software is that you are using.\n\n40\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.270\nSo we've connected to\nthe manufacturer's website.\n\n41\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.960\nI've already gone ahead and\ndownloaded the installer.\n\n42\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we'll go\nthrough the installation process here.\n\n43\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.040\nNow this is one of the ones that I have\nto say will give you a serial number.\n\n44\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.550\nSo keep in mind you will end up having\nto have that information beforehand,\n\n45\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820\nas the installer starts.\n\n46\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.470\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nit's gonna prepare, it's gonna connect.\n\n47\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.770\nAnd the first thing it's gonna wanna\ndo is it's gonna want us to verify\n\n48\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.580\nThat we have our serial number present,\nand it looks like it's connected.\n\n49\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.840\nIt's gonna ask us if we want to complete\nthis, and we'll choose next and\n\n50\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.440\nwe'll let it go through\nits install process.\n\n51\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.500\nNow keep in mind if it asks you for\n\n52\n00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.620\nyour serial number you'll\nhave to put that in here.\n\n53\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.960\nI've got that off to the side, and\n\n54\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.490\nsince I'm connecting directly\nto the manufactures website\n\n55\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.330\nI already had to authenticate ahead\nof time with an established account.\n\n56\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.460\nSo it didn't ask me this time for\nthe serial numbers.\n\n57\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.450\nSo I just want you guys\nto be aware of that.\n\n58\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.200\nIf you download the executable and\nyou haven't set up one of\n\n59\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.995\nthose McAfee accounts, you're gonna\nhave to enter that serial number.\n\n60\n00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:18.285\nOne of the things that\nalso has to happen is,\n\n61\n00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:22.525\nif you decide that you want to\nuninstall it after you've activated it,\n\n62\n00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:26.475\nthey want you to do any reverse\nengineering or something like that.\n\n63\n00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:29.070\nYou're gonna have to connect back\nto the manufacturer's website.\n\n64\n00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.810\nAnd you're going to have to\ndownload it from them, and\n\n65\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.460\nwhat they're going to do is they're\ngoing to update your serial number.\n\n66\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.840\nAnd again, it's probably just making sure\nthat people aren't reverse engineering\n\n67\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.890\nthe software, maybe having some kind of\nkey gen if you will they can automatically\n\n68\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.580\ngenerate some kind of key for\nyour serial number.\n\n69\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.000\nAnd notice that Windows updates\nit says it's turned off.\n\n70\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.130\nYou might see another one\ncome up here that says\n\n71\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.155\nthat we haven't noticed\nany anti virus software.\n\n72\n00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:00.930\nCuz with a lot of these, these third\nparty solutions that you go with\n\n73\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.790\nkeep in mind that Windows Defender\nis turned on by default and\n\n74\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.680\nby default it's actively\nscanning your computer.\n\n75\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.860\nNow when you go into the installation\nprocess, what happens at a certain point,\n\n76\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.930\nthis anti-malware software's gonna see\nthe fact that Windows Defender's on.\n\n77\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.170\nAnd could even see the fact that\npotentially your firewall's on.\n\n78\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.800\nSo it's gonna turn them off in\npreparation to install and become\n\n79\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.290\nyour choice of firewall, or if you will,\nyour choice of anti-malware software.\n\n80\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.490\nAnd it looks like it's taking a little\nbit to go through this installer process.\n\n81\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.439\nKeep in mind that it really is\ncontingent on your connection speed,\n\n82\n00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:40.220\nand like we've mentioned in some of the\npast episodes, you might be required like\n\n83\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.886\nthis software does, to connect over\nthe Internet prior to even installing it.\n\n84\n00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:48.000\nSo you have to make sure that you\ndo have an Internet connection.\n\n85\n00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.590\nSometimes you'll have the software out\nthere that you won't require a connection,\n\n86\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.690\nyou can download it,\nyou can install it offline.\n\n87\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.930\nAnd those are good in certain scenarios\nwhere maybe you have an antivirus or\n\n88\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.920\nyou think you might have a virus and\nyou want to quarantine the system.\n\n89\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.630\nAnd, if you think about it, you really\ndon't want to connect those systems to\n\n90\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.180\nyour network if you consider\nthat they're already infected.\n\n91\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.440\nSo, if you do have one of these pieces\nof software here that does require\n\n92\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.890\nan internet connection to get it\ninstalled, before you can even use it,\n\n93\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.062\nyou do run the risk of potentially...let's\ngo ahead and go through next.\n\n94\n00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:26.140\nOh, and it's sending anonymous information\nhere, too, McAfee, let me go ahead and\n\n95\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.620\nfinish my thought process, though.\n\n96\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.530\nIf you need to connect outbound to\nthe Internet, In order to activate this,\n\n97\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.710\nwell you'd have to connect that\ninfected machine to your network and\n\n98\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.200\nthat might not be\nsomething that you'll want.\n\n99\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.700\nSo definitely keep that in mind.\n\n100\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.930\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose next, and\nwe'll let it run through its installation.\n\n101\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.800\nAnd it can finish\nthe download of the software.\n\n102\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.660\nIt's installing things like the firewall.\n\n103\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.940\nIt's installing an anti-spam filter.\n\n104\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.210\nAnd it can integrate\ninto a lot of components.\n\n105\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.430\nSo it looks like it's finished here.\n\n106\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.810\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n107\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.910\nTook a little bit on that one, and\ndepending on your connection speed,\n\n108\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.500\ndepending on the quality\nof the computer and\n\n109\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.240\nthe CPU strength, it could take you less,\nit could take you a little bit more here.\n\n110\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.450\nSo once the product's installed, it's up\nand running It'll go through a few more,\n\n111\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.410\nas you can see here, a few more seconds\nof the post-installation tasks.\n\n112\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.280\nAnd then hopefully here in a second,\nwe can run the software, and\n\n113\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.100\nit should be actively scanning already.\n\n114\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.450\nThere we go.\n\n115\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.350\nThis is the McAfee,\nI will not get that right.\n\n116\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.720\nI can tell you that right now\nregardless of how it's pronounced.\n\n117\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.938\nThis is McAfee Total Protection,\n\n118\n00:06:31.938 --> 00:06:35.340\nand you can see this tiled interface and\nthat's really good.\n\n119\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.250\nIt makes, for\nthe average end-user out there,\n\n120\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.630\nif you're not aware some more\nof the advanced setting,\n\n121\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.660\nmaybe you don't wanna click around and\nfind those settings.\n\n122\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.370\nIt puts the most common\nsettings right in front of you.\n\n123\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.940\nAnd gives you more of an intuitive\ninterface so that you can navigate around.\n\n124\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.580\nYou can also use the navigation\noption over here.\n\n125\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.630\nSo, one of the first things that we\nwant to look at is some of the basic\n\n126\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.350\nconfigurations that you can do.\n\n127\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.283\nNow in here, you've got the ability,\nyou can scan you PC.\n\n128\n00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:03.240\nAll right and I'll tell you what,let's go\nahead and get into this scan option here.\n\n129\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.790\nNow when you get into the scan options\nhere you can run quick scans right.\n\n130\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.810\nRemember quick scans, anytime you run\na quick scan and a piece of malware or\n\n131\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.670\nany malware software, it's gonna scour, or\n\n132\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.680\nscan, if you will, the common\nlocations that virus' are known to\n\n133\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.730\noperate in like your windows directories,\nyour user profile, temporary directories.\n\n134\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.060\nWhere your temporary files are for\nyour operating system.\n\n135\n00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.850\nSo a lot of the common locations that you\nmight see these viruses infect based on\n\n136\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.260\nthings like trend analysis, you run\nthe quick scan and that's what it does.\n\n137\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.040\nA full scan guys, that really\ndoes exactly what it sounds like.\n\n138\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.870\nIt scans everything.\n\n139\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.240\nAnd then there's also\nthis custom scan here.\n\n140\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.460\nAnd I want to take a look\nhere at the custom scan and\n\n141\n00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.291\nkinda show you guys some of\nthe settings that you can do there.\n\n142\n00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.697\nNow they've really stripped\ndown the interface.\n\n143\n00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:51.107\nIf you look there's not\na lot to this interface.\n\n144\n00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:54.184\nCustomize your scan We can do exclusions,\nand we'll talk about them,\n\n145\n00:07:54.184 --> 00:07:54.964\nhere in a second.\n\n146\n00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:59.045\nSo if I customize my scan,\nnow I have the ability that I can say,\n\n147\n00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:02.100\nwhat locations do you wanna scan, right?\n\n148\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.832\nYou can see Critical system files,\nand this, I can tell you, is gonna be,\n\n149\n00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:09.405\nwhat the quick scan's gonna do as well.\n\n150\n00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:13.665\nIt also uses things like heuristics,\nright, unknown viruses.\n\n151\n00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:16.685\nRemember if we've got\nthe definition in the database or\n\n152\n00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:20.411\nthe signature in the database then\nwe know by looking at that virus and\n\n153\n00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:24.715\ncomparing it back to the hash value that's\nin the signature what a virus is, but\n\n154\n00:08:24.715 --> 00:08:27.010\nwhat if we don't have that signature?\n\n155\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.670\nAnd that's where the heuristics comes\nin making decisions on if it looks like\n\n156\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.660\na virus, if it's acting,\nif it's creating a shortcut,\n\n157\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.230\nif it's trying to modify a system file,\nif it's creating a registry entry.\n\n158\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.690\nThat might trigger the fact\nthat this might be a virus so\n\n159\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.920\nyou can do this as well.\n\n160\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.440\nYou can also scan things like your\nzipped and compressed files as well.\n\n161\n00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.980\nI'm not gonna make a modification to this,\nbecause I want it to scan everything.\n\n162\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.440\nI don't know if it's just a zip file.\n\n163\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.180\nBut you can also exclude the zip files,\nbecause it's gonna take a little bit more\n\n164\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.490\ncomputational power,\ncuz it's gotta look into them.\n\n165\n00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.480\nIt's not like an open file, if you will.\n\n166\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.720\nSo it might take a little bit\nmore resources to do that.\n\n167\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.510\nSo fairly easy when you're\nsetting up the custom scan.\n\n168\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.550\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.930\nSo, not too bad Ronnie there,\nwhen it comes to setting up your scans,\n\n170\n00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.990\nrelatively easy when it comes down to it,\nas far as just going in here,\n\n171\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.820\nthe virus and protection, talking about\nyour, or which ones you wanna use.\n\n172\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.850\nThe other one I might talk briefly\non is the real time scanning.\n\n173\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.990\nYou wanna make sure that real time\nprotection is always on, right.\n\n174\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.990\nYou don't wanna install\nan antivirus software and\n\n175\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.290\nthen not allow it to\nprotect your computer, so\n\n176\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.190\nyou can make modifications to this,\nturning it on or off.\n\n177\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.720\nAnd what's really cool is, you can change,\nagain, what is it going to, you know,\n\n178\n00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.210\nwhat is it gonna look at, right?\n\n179\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.220\nIf this computer is a network computer,\n\n180\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.440\nmaybe I'm sharing resources\nacross the network.\n\n181\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.520\nMaybe you've got, for instance\nWindows 7 supports Home Groups, right?\n\n182\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.710\nYou got another computer within your\nnetwork that isn't this computer, but\n\n183\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.180\nyou're sharing, Files and\nresources with another computer.\n\n184\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.420\nWe know that that's how\nviruses will spread.\n\n185\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.140\nAnd I can say, go ahead and\ninclude those shared folders there too.\n\n186\n00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.300\nAnd if you are networking, you know on\na home network where you have maybe media\n\n187\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.920\nand file sharing,\nall those locations are just as\n\n188\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.620\nsusceptible to viruses as any\nother file folder is too.\n\n189\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.100\nSo you might go ahead and say,\nyeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n190\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.370\ninclude those.\n\n191\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.060\nNow you also have the ability for\nthe start up settings.\n\n192\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.750\nAll right, if you've been aware of\nsomething like elam, all right.\n\n193\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.280\nInside of windows it's sports elam and\n\n194\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.780\nthat's the early launch\nanti malware driver.\n\n195\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.050\nAnd what it does is it\nchecks your system files,\n\n196\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.170\nyour boot files at start up time you know\nprotecting you from things like root kits.\n\n197\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.930\nBecause root kits like to get\nthere boot loader viruses.\n\n198\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.450\nYou know they like to get in there\nbefore the anti malware even kicks on.\n\n199\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.200\nAll right, well then what this does is\nmonitor the early start up process right.\n\n200\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.710\nCheck for most common threats or\ncheck for all known threats.\n\n201\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.310\nNow keep in mind this is going to hinder\nthe performance of your boot time but\n\n202\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.420\nwhat do we want?\n\n203\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.720\nConvenience, right.\n\n204\n00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.900\nIf we want convenience a lot\nof times we lower security.\n\n205\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.630\nOr do we wanna be a little bit maybe more\ninconvenienced because it's going to be\n\n206\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.700\na slower boot process, but\nwe're scanning for everything.\n\n207\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.300\nSo, that's gonna be\ncontentious there's no right or\n\n208\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.960\nwrongs on that one guys\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n209\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.460\nThe other thing is exclusions we could\nset up exclusions just like most\n\n210\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.480\nanti virus software allow you to do.\n\n211\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.390\nAlright, like for instance,\n\n212\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.770\nyou know if you're doing research on\nviruses this is a virtual machine.\n\n213\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.810\nYou wanna test whether this virtual\nmachine or the machine that you're working\n\n214\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.120\nwith is actually doing its job but\nyou got security class software in there.\n\n215\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.880\nMaybe you're testing viruses.\n\n216\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.030\nWell I might not want to it to check this\ncertain location because if I'm testing\n\n217\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.930\nviruses well maybe it's gonna find them\nand it's gonna say hey these are viruses.\n\n218\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.520\nLet me go ahead and quarantine those and\nI'll remove them from the system and\n\n219\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.580\nnow all the files that you're looking for\nto test are gone.\n\n220\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.170\nSo you can set up things\nlike exclusions as well.\n\n221\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.510\nNot really too difficult there\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n222\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.250\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna close that down.\n\n223\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.760\nBut with that Ronnie,\nit's not really that hard.\n\n224\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.720\nYou know, even from that one tab,\nor tile, and I'm so\n\n225\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.140\nused to saying tabs and\nit's all tile interfaces today.\n\n226\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.920\nBut from that one tile,\nit's fairly easy to set up your scans,\n\n227\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.740\ndefine what scan you want,\nand then implement them.\n\n228\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.530\n>> Yeah, and\njust like any other security solution,\n\n229\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.320\na lot of times of course the consumer\ngrade types of interfaces that you and\n\n230\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.640\nI end up having is really gonna be well,\n\n231\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.770\nbased on what the user interface is going\nto really be as ease of use, right?\n\n232\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.150\nSo most people they don't want a lot\nof buttons, they don't want everything.\n\n233\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.240\nThey do a nice little graphical interface,\nbut they also want to make sure that, hey,\n\n234\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.440\nit's as simple as possible.\n\n235\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.700\nThe other thing that we actually\nhave to worry about, Wes, though,\n\n236\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.920\nis the same thing which\nis of course updating.\n\n237\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.680\nWhat's the updating features\nwe have here in McAfee?\n\n238\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.286\n>> Yeah, and just like Ronnie says,\nwe've got to keep 'em updated, right?\n\n239\n00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:47.510\nIt doesn't do you much good to\nhave an antivirus software if\n\n240\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.310\nyour antivirus software Isn't aware of\n\n241\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.710\nthose hundreds of thousands of viruses\nthat can potentially come out each week.\n\n242\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.970\nSo this really isn't\ntoo hard to do updates.\n\n243\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.420\nYou could see right here\non the main interface, some\n\n244\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.360\nof the main things that you can do, and\nwe can manage our updates here as well.\n\n245\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.950\nNow, we can check for updates and\nthis is just as simple as it looks.\n\n246\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.090\nYou guys are smart enough.\n\n247\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.930\nYou can see what that means.\n\n248\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.970\nIf I'm just going to check for\nupdates right, but\n\n249\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.220\nI can also configure the update settings,\nalright?\n\n250\n00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.000\nMaybe there are some modifications\nthat I want to make.\n\n251\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.500\nNow, this really is a lot like,\nfor instance, Windows Update.\n\n252\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.530\nRight?\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n253\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.355\nDo you want to download and\ninstall the updates automatically?\n\n254\n00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:31.495\nDo you want to download them and\nnotify me before installing?\n\n255\n00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:34.045\nOr, do you just want to notify\nme when updates are available?\n\n256\n00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:39.755\nNow, again, there's not really any right\nor wrong way to say this or to do this.\n\n257\n00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:41.405\nMaybe you have a limited bandwidth.\n\n258\n00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:43.335\nMaybe you have a metered connection right?\n\n259\n00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:45.875\nWell, if you're a meter connection\nyou might use that last option and\n\n260\n00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:49.090\nthat's not a bad thing because you're not\nsaying disable it you're just saying,\n\n261\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.900\ndon't download them until I'm ready.\n\n262\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.080\nBut, anytime you say something like,\nnotify me,\n\n263\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.460\nthat means you're usually gonna increase\nthe complexities of managing the data.\n\n264\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.210\nAnd you're not managing it,\nbut you have to remember.\n\n265\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.950\nThat if you set it that way, you have\nto remember to go back in and check.\n\n266\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.170\nSo a lot of times, it's good if you've got\na busy schedule, if you're like me and\n\n267\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.535\nyou wouldn't remember your head\nif wasn't attached to the neck,\n\n268\n00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:13.620\n[LAUGH] then you might want to go ahead\nand just leave it at the default setting\n\n269\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.890\nto where it goes ahead and\nit downloads those automatically for you.\n\n270\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.450\nAnd then you don't have\nto worry about them.\n\n271\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.100\nSo, when it comes to the updates running\nand managing them and maintaining them\n\n272\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.540\nIt's good, especially for someone like\nme that I don't really have to do this.\n\n273\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.760\nI can set it, forget it.\n\n274\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.450\nBut one of the problems can be,\nwhen you set it to these other options,\n\n275\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.410\nand then you walk away and\nyou forget about it.\n\n276\n00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.650\nAnd now you're running scans.\n\n277\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.670\nNow, maybe you're doing your due\ndiligence, you're running your scans.\n\n278\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.100\nBut you're running your scans on a virus\ndatabase that has actually been out of\n\n279\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.940\ndate for four months.\n\n280\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.120\nYeah, it'll catch probably a lot of\nthe common viruses, but we know it's\n\n281\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.280\na revolving door with security\nupdates versus viruses being found.\n\n282\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.630\nYou need to keep it updated regularly.\n\n283\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.670\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n284\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.660\nWith that, the basic anti malware and\nantivirus types of solution when we're\n\n285\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.350\ntalking about seems that should be\nworking fairly well for McAfee and\n\n286\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.040\nit actually seems to\nprobably do a great job.\n\n287\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.930\nBut there's also,\nlike anything else right,\n\n288\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.350\nwith security suites there's actually\nother features that may be available.\n\n289\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.850\nSo Les, what makes this one\nstand out a little bit more?\n\n290\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.040\n>> You know, there are some things, extra\nthings that this suite can do, right.\n\n291\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.090\nJust like, you know a lot of\nthe other suites out there.\n\n292\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.110\nSome of the things that\nwe have is over here.\n\n293\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.730\nThese three tiles on the right hand side.\n\n294\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.360\nLet's go to the first one here,\ndata protection.\n\n295\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.190\nThey got what is known as file lock.\n\n296\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.430\nWhat you can do is if you\nhave sensitive files,\n\n297\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.818\nmaybe you got credit card information,\nmaybe you've got a receipt or\n\n298\n00:15:37.818 --> 00:15:40.071\nsomething that has a lot\nof your information.\n\n299\n00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:43.367\nWho knows, maybe on an electronic document\nonline that's HIPPA compliant, right?\n\n300\n00:15:43.367 --> 00:15:44.717\nMaybe your doctor's information.\n\n301\n00:15:44.717 --> 00:15:49.686\nI don't wanna just leave that\nOn my hard drive in my computer,\n\n302\n00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:51.610\nI wanna lock that down.\n\n303\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.890\nSo what does file lock mean?\n\n304\n00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.530\nIt means I have a location\nwithin the McAfee\n\n305\n00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.322\nsolution that will encrypt those files.\n\n306\n00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:01.640\nOkay, it's It's called\na digital vault there, and\n\n307\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.100\nit'll keep those documents so other people\nthat log into this machine can't see them,\n\n308\n00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.830\ncuz then you're gonna turn around and\npassword protect it.\n\n309\n00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.750\nSo even if you walked\naway from your computer,\n\n310\n00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.340\nwhich you should be locking if you do,\nyou come back and\n\n311\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.080\nsomebody's sitting at your computer,\nthey'll have to have a password.\n\n312\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.390\nThe other thing is data eradication.\n\n313\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.680\nMaybe you've got files,\nmaybe you do have that receipt, or\n\n314\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.140\nmaybe you do have some of that information\nfrom your doctor that you no longer need.\n\n315\n00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.140\nYou needed to save it for\nprinting it, you printed it,\n\n316\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.920\nnow you don't wanna have that information.\n\n317\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.370\nWell you can also do data eradication and\n\n318\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.320\njust permanently erase that\nsensitive information.\n\n319\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.380\nSo the data protection software Or\nextension if you will,\n\n320\n00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.090\nit's within this software really good.\n\n321\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.710\nI'm gonna skip over the PC home and\n\n322\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.080\nnetwork tools here real quick cuz\nthat's all about performance,\n\n323\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.060\nwe'll come back to that and focus on\nmore of the security options here.\n\n324\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.310\nParental controls.\n\n325\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.510\nAll right, parental controls,\nthat's a good thing.\n\n326\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.710\nRonnie, I know you're a parent,\nI'm a parent, and\n\n327\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.530\nwe want to keep our kids safe, right?\n\n328\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.540\nWe wanna make sure the browsing\nexperience is safe.\n\n329\n00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.860\nWe certainly probably don't\nwant them downloading files.\n\n330\n00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.080\nAnd whatever you it is that you set\nthe rules in your house for your kids,\n\n331\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.940\nyou wanna be able to set that up.\n\n332\n00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.420\nSo we can actually turn on\nthe parental controls here.\n\n333\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.182\nAnd let me go ahead and set a password.\n\n334\n00:17:11.182 --> 00:17:14.780\nAnd I always got to remember,\nbecause with this one,\n\n335\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.680\nthe password,\nyou can only use letters and numbers.\n\n336\n00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.940\nAnd I'm so used to the complexed\npasswords that you really can't do\n\n337\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.540\ntoo complexed of a password here.\n\n338\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.470\nAnd guys out there,\nI don't know if I should show you this.\n\n339\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.834\nBut I'm going to show you a portion of\nthe password just so I can remember it.\n\n340\n00:17:32.434 --> 00:17:37.276\nAll right, and I'll just put a tip\nin there and a hint, or whatever,\n\n341\n00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:41.825\nand what that does is kinda reminds\nme that hey, this password.\n\n342\n00:17:41.825 --> 00:17:45.550\nNow it's telling me to memorize that\nbecause, I've actually done this before,\n\n343\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.680\nwhere I've set a password, I've done\nit on a router before, you go in and\n\n344\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.680\nyou configure a home router, you set\nthe password, you go to log back into it,\n\n345\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.580\nyou can't remember the password,\nyou gotta reset everything.\n\n346\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.580\nSo be careful with this when you\nreally do have to set that up.\n\n347\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.940\nNow, notice that it says User01,\nall right?\n\n348\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.570\nIt says not protected.\n\n349\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.260\nNow, let me go ahead and\ngive you a piece of advice.\n\n350\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.310\nAn administrative account that's\non your machine, if your kids, and\n\n351\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.390\nwhatever age they might be,\nlog in as an administrative account,\n\n352\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.420\nthis parental control does you no good,\nlet me show you why.\n\n353\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.770\nBecause user 01 I know is a administrator\nhere, and if I go to protect this,\n\n354\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.190\nit's gonna give me a warning and say, wait\na second this is a Windows administrator.\n\n355\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.670\nWindows administrators can bypass\ncertain security controls,\n\n356\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.980\nthey can even uninstall the software.\n\n357\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.240\nSo if you set parental controls\neven on your kids account,\n\n358\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.230\nif that kids account is\nnot a standard user and\n\n359\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.300\nis an administrative account\nthey can turn around and\n\n360\n00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.070\nuninstall the software and then anything\nyou've done is pretty much undone.\n\n361\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.890\nSo just keep that in mind here.\n\n362\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.820\nAnd then you can set those controls.\n\n363\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.850\nAnd it gives you the ability to set the\nage range, and what your kids can see and\n\n364\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.590\nwhat they can do and what they can't do.\n\n365\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.270\nSo let me go ahead and\nwe'll cancel that and\n\n366\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.320\njust keep in mind\nthe parental controls are on.\n\n367\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.480\nSo, really, really cool feature there.\n\n368\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.880\nOne of the last features I might mention,\nis some of the PC Home and\n\n369\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.330\nNetwork Tools there.\n\n370\n00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.280\nOne of the ones I really like here and,\nlet's see if we can see that a little\n\n371\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.490\nbetter there, is this Home and\nNetwork Defense that we have.\n\n372\n00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.680\nThe home and network defense,\none of the reasons I like this, Ronnie,\n\n373\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.000\nis because in home networks, you know\nwho's connected to your home network?\n\n374\n00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.150\nRight?\nYou know certain devices are,\n\n375\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.770\nmaybe your mobile phone's out there.\n\n376\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:26.770\nOf course, you're gonna connect to your\ntablets, your gaming consoles and stuff.\n\n377\n00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.260\nAnd what's really cool is\nthis can find all of them and\n\n378\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.780\nit shows you what they're here.\n\n379\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.020\nNow I will say you gotta be careful cuz it\nmight not give you all the information.\n\n380\n00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.760\nThis does because it's\nthe computer that is protected, so\n\n381\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.150\nyou can see I've got my\nWIN7-MCAFFEE machine here.\n\n382\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.920\nIt tells me the name,\n\n383\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.490\ntells me the operating system, even tells\nme my IP address and my MAC address.\n\n384\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.880\nAnd it tells me a file and\nprinter sharing is on too.\n\n385\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.380\nSo kinda cool.\n\n386\n00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.790\nBut I will say that there\nare some limitations to it.\n\n387\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.330\nYou'll see a couple\nother devices out here.\n\n388\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.310\nIt's just got generic names on it here.\n\n389\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.070\nLike for instance,\nI believe this is my router.\n\n390\n00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.250\nSo, yeah, this is the default\ngateway that we're connected to.\n\n391\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.790\nSo it even gives you\ninformation on that as well.\n\n392\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.750\nTelling you what router,\nwhat the router's IP address and\n\n393\n00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.370\nthe MAC address is now, it can give\nyou information on the vendor too.\n\n394\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:19.460\nAnd then sometimes it'll do something\nlike this, it'll say unknown device,\n\n395\n00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.770\nhas no clue what it is but it still gives\nyou the IP address and the MAC address.\n\n396\n00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.480\nAnd Ronnie, as we talked about\nin other security episodes,\n\n397\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.880\nwhat if you have somebody that's\nconnecting to your network.\n\n398\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.300\nYou come in here and say,\nI have four devices, so\n\n399\n00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.000\nI could say four devices right\nhere including my router, and\n\n400\n00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.860\nI come in here one day and\nI see five devices or I see six devices.\n\n401\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.460\nWell at least I have the ability to\nfind those devices on the network.\n\n402\n00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.600\nAnd one of the really cool things,\nI really like this, mark as intruder.\n\n403\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.100\nSo if I come in here one day, and I see\nthat there are a couple extra devices\n\n404\n00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.740\non my network, and I have no clue where\nthey are, mark them as an intruder and\n\n405\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.240\ngive you a little bit more security.\n\n406\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.060\nSo, kind of really cool on that one.\n\n407\n00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.840\nA couple of the other things that\nyou can do here in the PC and\n\n408\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.250\nHome Tools QuickClean.\n\n409\n00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.190\nAll right, QuickClean is gonna\ndo kind of like disc clean up\n\n410\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.970\nis inside of your operating system.\n\n411\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.420\nIt's gonna go through and it's gonna erase\nthings like your temporary files and\n\n412\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.090\nget them cleaned up.\n\n413\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.480\nHopefully, improve\nthe performance of your machines.\n\n414\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.850\nAll right, now the next thing you can do\nis an overall vulnerability assessment.\n\n415\n00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.610\nAnd what it does, is it'll look and\n\n416\n00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.810\nit'll actually help you to install\nthings like your Windows updates.\n\n417\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.410\nNow, you can do this from inside\nof the operating system, but\n\n418\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:36.960\nit is one of the things that you can\ndo as well inside of this software.\n\n419\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.160\nNow Ronnie, I'll tell you what.\n\n420\n00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.970\nWe've talked a lot about viruses.\n\n421\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.290\nWe've talked a lot about some\nof the scanning options.\n\n422\n00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.720\nHow about we infect this machine too?\n\n423\n00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.690\n>> Sounds like a good idea.\n\n424\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.020\n>> See what can happen here.\n\n425\n00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.910\nNow guys, like we've mentioned already,\nto infect a machine,\n\n426\n00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.590\nI'm simply using\na standard file out there.\n\n427\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.640\nIt's a standard for testing the real\ntime protection in these machines.\n\n428\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.360\nAnd I can't download it ahead of time.\n\n429\n00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.990\nIt's interesting when you're trying\nto test it every time you pull this\n\n430\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.350\nfile over, if your antivirus software's\ngood, it finds it right away and\n\n431\n00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.360\nit eradicates it.\n\n432\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.030\nWhich is good, that's what we want.\n\n433\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.650\nWe'll see if it's on the money here,\nso I pulled a file,\n\n434\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.080\nit's not a virus by the way, guys.\n\n435\n00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.520\nI pulled this file over here, and\nit's doing real time protection.\n\n436\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.140\nAnd it could take a second to find it.\n\n437\n00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.990\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe'll speed it up here.\n\n438\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.520\nAnd we'll do a scan, and I'm gonna take\nyou back to that scheduled scan, or\n\n439\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.630\ncustom scan, if you will.\n\n440\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.290\nAnd then what we're gonna\ndo is customize it,\n\n441\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.510\nand we'll see if I can actually\nget to it before it catches it.\n\n442\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.830\nLet's see, there we go, desktop.\n\n443\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:44.020\nAnd I'll zoom in and show you guys exactly\nwhat I'm doing here in a second so\n\n444\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.310\nyou guys can see.\n\n445\n00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.810\nRemember when you customize your\nscans you can really just apply this.\n\n446\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.640\nSo what I said is, you know what,\nI know where the virus is in this case so\n\n447\n00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.020\nlet's go ahead and speed it up and\nwe'll just point it right to the desktop.\n\n448\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.230\nWe'll go ahead and apply.\n\n449\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.900\nAnd once that's done, we'll click scan.\n\n450\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.660\nAnd then hopefully,\nwhat it's gonna do here is it's gonna,\n\n451\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.010\noh it's already taking it off guys.\n\n452\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.350\nYou might see it's disappeared over there.\n\n453\n00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.820\nAnd it tells me, one issue found, right?\n\n454\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.380\nOne file infected by a virus,\nand it says issues fixed already.\n\n455\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.900\nSo it found it.\n\n456\n00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.520\nIt quarantined it and\nit's already removed it.\n\n457\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.770\nIt's almost done here.\n\n458\n00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.110\nIt's about, we'll give it a little bit\nlonger and see if it goes to 100%, and\n\n459\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.175\nthen what we can do is we can verify.\n\n460\n00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:30.110\nThat's another thing that I wanna mention\nis, when you are using these scanners and\n\n461\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.470\nit does quarantine something,\n\n462\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:36.020\nit is great that it takes care of it,\nbut go back and look at the logs.\n\n463\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.925\nBecause you wanna find out, maybe you say,\nI know I went to that gaming website,\n\n464\n00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:41.441\nright?\n\n465\n00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:45.617\nI went to that gaming website and I didn't\nhave this problem until then, right?\n\n466\n00:23:45.617 --> 00:23:47.336\nWe talk about troubleshooting, right?\n\n467\n00:23:47.336 --> 00:23:51.956\nYou have to know What actions,\nwhat are you doing on your machine to\n\n468\n00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:55.900\nmaybe contract this virus,\nto download this virus?\n\n469\n00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.020\nSo it is good to look\nat this information and\n\n470\n00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.780\nit looks like it's taking a little bit so\nI tell you what, we'll go ahead and\n\n471\n00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:05.510\njust hide this for now, but\nyou do see that it has, oh, there we go.\n\n472\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.730\nAnd it's running in the back.\n\n473\n00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.870\nOkay, so it's just letting me know that\nit's running in the background here,\n\n474\n00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.000\nand we'll choose Close.\n\n475\n00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.210\nAnd that's another thing\ntoo with the pop-ups.\n\n476\n00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.470\nDon't close all your pop-ups down.\n\n477\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.270\nI know some people don't want\nto be bothered by it, but\n\n478\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.580\nthose pop-ups are there for a reason.\n\n479\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.240\nAnd if you negate to view them\nbecause they're interrupting you,\n\n480\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.500\nyou won't know that it's just catching\nvirus after virus after virus,\n\n481\n00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.930\nand you might be under\nsome kind of attack.\n\n482\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.640\nIt might be some backdoor type of attack.\n\n483\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.880\nIt might be just the fact that maybe\nyou are going to a gaming platform and\n\n484\n00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.400\nsomebody slips some code in\nthere that you can't see.\n\n485\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.180\nAnd even though the gaming platform\nitself is absolutely legit,\n\n486\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.640\nit maybe somebody has\nattacked that gaming website.\n\n487\n00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.030\nSo keep in mind, don't disable\nthe notifications altogether.\n\n488\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.190\nAnd if you do, go back and\ncheck the logs just so you're aware.\n\n489\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.990\nBut you know Ronnie, for the most part,\nit's taken care of business here and\n\n490\n00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.790\nit's cleaned up our files and\nhopefully taken this virus out.\n\n491\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.150\n>> Looked like a fairly decent product for\nmost end users.\n\n492\n00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.610\nIf they're really searching for one,\nyou're probably gonna end up finding out.\n\n493\n00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.670\nBut hey, everybody just\nreally wants it to work, and\n\n494\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.070\nthey don't really care too\nmuch about the interface.\n\n495\n00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.520\nBut McAfee and even some of the other ones\nwe've looked at seem to be very good and\n\n496\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.840\nviable solutions.\n\n497\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.750\nRemember, the key to all these solutions,\nof course,\n\n498\n00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.590\nis making sure that the antivirus\nupdates are happening, and\n\n499\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.590\nthat you do have the regular\nscans going on as well.\n\n500\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:27.670\nWell Wes, thank you again for showing\nus the McAfee Total Protection Suite or\n\n501\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.350\nis is Mac-Afee?\n\n502\n00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.650\n>> I don't know,\nI'm gonna call it whatever I will.\n\n503\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.160\nYou know, I'll end up calling it\npeanut butter before it's done,\n\n504\n00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.860\nso you choose your naming\nconvention out there.\n\n505\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.330\n>> Yeah, you know that's the burning\nquestion that I had after all\n\n506\n00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.440\nthe security stuff.\n\n507\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.070\nYou know, if there's any question\nI would have it would be that one.\n\n508\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.620\nBut no, no joke right, any time that\nwe have the ability to be able to\n\n509\n00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.510\nchoose what particular solution we want,\nwanna make sure that we're actually\n\n510\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.430\nare informed about and realize that\nmost of the companies out there,\n\n511\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.160\nthey're trying to produce good stuff.\n\n512\n00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.980\nThey're not really trying to harm you.\n\n513\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.700\nI keep saying that.\n\n514\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.110\nThat people are going to say,\nthere's no waym but\n\n515\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.560\nyou got to realize that hey, these\nguys are out there to help us out and\n\n516\n00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.000\nwe can't live in this world without them.\n\n517\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.900\nWes, you got a little bit more?\n\n518\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.430\n>> Well, you know what, I was just gonna\ntell you guys out there looks like\n\n519\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.730\nthe scan is done and\nwe can actually view the details.\n\n520\n00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.610\nI didn't know how long it was gonna take,\nbut it tells me down here at the bottom,\n\n521\n00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.990\nit says, hey, look,\nwhat we've scanned, right?\n\n522\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.470\nWe've scanned a lot of stuff here.\n\n523\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.030\nIt tells me that there were,\nthere was a virus that it found.\n\n524\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.950\nKeep in mind, guys, like I said out there,\nthis is just a test virus.\n\n525\n00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.670\nI can go in and I can view the details and\n\n526\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.690\nI can see all the information\nthat's being scanned here.\n\n527\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.780\nAnd it can tell me,\nwas there any detected viruses?\n\n528\n00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.010\nSo you could say it didn't find anything\nin the processes that were running.\n\n529\n00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.700\nThat's good for things like\nbehavioral based scanning right,\n\n530\n00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.760\ncritical system files,\nand your boot records.\n\n531\n00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.050\nThank goodness, no boot viruses,\nbut it did find one in those files.\n\n532\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.660\nIt let me know that we've already\nseen that it took care of it.\n\n533\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.330\nIt erased it off the desktop.\n\n534\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.040\nAnd it looks like we're good to go.\n\n535\n00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.620\n>> All right.\n\n536\n00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.840\nThat's a great place for us to also go\nahead and end this particular episode,\n\n537\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.760\nas well.\n\n538\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.130\nSo, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n539\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.750\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n540\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.005\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n541\n00:27:04.005 --> 00:27:09.250\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

host\n\n3\n00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:21.010\nMike Rodrick and today we're gonna be\nlooking at anti-virus, anti-malware and\n\n4\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.070\nspecifically a program\ncalled Malwarebytes.\n\n5\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.400\nAnd here to help us with walking through,\ninstalling it, configuring, doing,\n\n6\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.810\nmaking it do it's magic, is Mr.\nWes Bryan, how's it going Wes?\n\n7\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.130\n>> It's going good and thanks for\nhaving me back here and that's right,\n\n8\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.170\nwe're moving along in our\nconsumer anti-virus episodes.\n\n9\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460\nAnd today we're looking at one of my\npersonal favorites, Malwarebytes.\n\n10\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.140\nAnd maybe you've used\nMalwarebytes out there before.\n\n11\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.770\nOne of the things I like about\nMalwarebytes is it does have a free\n\n12\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.300\nedition, and\nyou can download it to a thumb drive.\n\n13\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.260\nAnd if you have an infected computer that\nyou don't wanna attach to your network,\n\n14\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860\nit doesn't call home expecting\nan activation, which is really good.\n\n15\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.780\nThat's the free version.\n\n16\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.600\nNow if you've used the free version,\n\n17\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.200\nwell we're gonna go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n18\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.830\nWe're gonna actually install the paid\nversion here, so tell you what, Mike I\n\n19\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.950\nthink we should just go ahead and we'll\njump right in rather than talk about it.\n\n20\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.310\nSo here in my machine I've already gone\nahead and downloaded the executable and\n\n21\n00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.320\nif you've installed software before\nyou've probably seen this many times.\n\n22\n00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.304\nThe installer really isn't too bad here.\n\n23\n00:01:19.304 --> 00:01:22.250\nAnd again it doesn't require\nany subscription level,\n\n24\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.883\nit doesn't require a serial number,\nall you have to do, go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:25.883 --> 00:01:29.150\njust connect out there to\nthe Malwarebytes website.\n\n26\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.090\nAnd when you download it,\none of the great things is you only have\n\n27\n00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.450\nto download a single download file,\nand it'll give you the free version,\n\n28\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960\nit'll give you the premium version,\nyou just have to pick.\n\n29\n00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.910\nAnd that's what we're doing right here.\n\n30\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.490\nYou'll pick your language for\nthe first time, as you see.\n\n31\n00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.135\nAnd my native language is English and\nmy secondary language is bad English.\n\n32\n00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll go through so\n\n33\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.930\njust pick the language\nthat is local to you.\n\n34\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.990\nAnd default locations, guys, so like I\nsaid, nothing really too complex, here.\n\n35\n00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.405\nIf you wanna change the location you can.\n\n36\n00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.200\nAnd so just like any pretty\nmuch any installer for\n\n37\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.090\njust about any software\nthat you might come across.\n\n38\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.520\nSo not too hard difficult\non this one here.\n\n39\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.290\nWe go to the installer process.\n\n40\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.870\nFairly quick to install it's a very\nlightweight program that's one of\n\n41\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.825\nthe things that I really like about it and\nlet me see if I can show you guys that.\n\n42\n00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:18.145\nSo here you can see, if I don't\nwant to have the premium version,\n\n43\n00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:19.715\nyou can go with the one that\nI was talking about, right.\n\n44\n00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:21.445\nThe free version and\n\n45\n00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:25.295\none of the things that's really good about\nit is you'll see even if I do the premium\n\n46\n00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:28.810\ntrial version, it's not gonna call back\nhome expecting you to set up an account.\n\n47\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.420\nAnd that's really good when you have\nsome kinda computer, like I said,\n\n48\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.800\nthat you really need to do\na network quarantine from it.\n\n49\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.970\nAnd you don't wanna plug it into\nyour network to do an update because\n\n50\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.560\nyour fear for propagating malware or\nmaybe a virus here.\n\n51\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.150\nSo fairly easy, not to difficult here.\n\n52\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.150\nIt'll go through the post\ninstallation process.\n\n53\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.140\nAnd as far as the installer itself goes,\nit's not too bad here.\n\n54\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.140\nAnd one of the things I was gonna show you\nguy updating, I like set it and forget it.\n\n55\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.380\nThis updates right away.\n\n56\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.010\nSo we'll still show you, Mike and I, we'll\nshow you updating it a little bit later,\n\n57\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.610\nhow you can force the update.\n\n58\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.530\nBut one of the good things is,\n\n59\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.130\nthe first time it downloads, it's gonna\ncheck the version of that database.\n\n60\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.010\nAnd Mike,\nit's gonna connect right outbound for you.\n\n61\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.230\n>> And that's a good thing, right?\n\n62\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.780\nI might have downloaded this a week ago,\na month ago, and\n\n63\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.210\nnever got around to installing it,\nor didn't need it until now.\n\n64\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.850\nNow, I install it, there's been a lot of\ndefinitions that have come out since then,\n\n65\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.960\nmost likely.\n\n66\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.780\nAnd I don't wanna do a scan\nif I've got an old copy.\n\n67\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.380\nI mean what's the point of running\na scan if you don't have the latest\n\n68\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.990\nversion, right?\n\n69\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.000\nWhy scan it and then update it,\nand then have to scan again.\n\n70\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.020\nSo good that it updates first.\n\n71\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.185\n>> Yeah, nothing like taking care of those\nviruses that came out in 1991, right?\n\n72\n00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:39.860\n[LAUGH] And speaking of updates and\nfiguring out configurations and stuff,\n\n73\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.756\nthis is that dashboard,\nthink about it as like a heads up view.\n\n74\n00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:45.720\nAnd notice that Mike was\ntalking about that database.\n\n75\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.170\nWell, you can see the version\nof the database right here.\n\n76\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.310\nYou can see the year,\nthe month, and the day there.\n\n77\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.810\nYou can also see what time the scan is\nrun and whether your RTP or real time\n\n78\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.710\nprotection is turned on so, fairly\neasy to, again, fairly easy interface.\n\n79\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.250\nIt's not really too difficult here.\n\n80\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.170\nMaybe you wanna find out\nthings like notification.\n\n81\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.000\nLet's start with just\nsome basic configuration.\n\n82\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.960\nI want to be aware when a virus\nends up getting on my computer.\n\n83\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.530\nWell if you go to the settings,\nwe're gonna show you scans to coming up.\n\n84\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.040\nSome of the really cool stuff.\n\n85\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.390\nBut if you go to your basic setting\nright here, a little gear icon,\n\n86\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.170\nand that's one of the things that it\nseem to be kinda synonymous with all\n\n87\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.780\nsoftware today when you want to configure\nsomething, put the little gear icon there.\n\n88\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.250\nYou guys can find that fairly easy.\n\n89\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.980\nNow notice that the notifications\nare enabled by default.\n\n90\n00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.790\nAnd they've got the close after three\nseconds so it'll go to transparent and\n\n91\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.960\nstart to fade out and disappear.\n\n92\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.230\nYou might say that maybe I don't\nwant my notifications, right.\n\n93\n00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.270\nI'm a busy person I don't want to see\nthese notifications all the time.\n\n94\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.250\nBut what happens if you're\nconstantly being attacked?\n\n95\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.110\nWhat happens if your like a backdoor type\nTrojan based type attack where they're\n\n96\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.480\nconstantly trying to get\nmalware on your computer.\n\n97\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.870\nIf you disable these notifications you\nwon't be aware of it so yes I know at\n\n98\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.180\nsometimes they can be a little intrusive,\nif you're trying to get stuff done.\n\n99\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.100\nBut notice or understand that\nthe notifications are there\n\n100\n00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.780\nto let you know something's going on.\n\n101\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.350\nAnd it's better to see nothing.\n\n102\n00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.320\nRight?\nNo news is good news in this situation.\n\n103\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.000\nRather than here nothing at all,\never, and you don't realize.\n\n104\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.260\nYou go into your history.\n\n105\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.970\nYou come back and\nyou're like well wait a second.\n\n106\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.720\nWhat are all these.\n\n107\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.180\nIt's removing all of this information and\nI wasn't aware of it.\n\n108\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.780\nI see w32.trojan whatever.\n\n109\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.330\nYour viruses in your history.\n\n110\n00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.630\nWell, you're not gonna be aware of that.\n\n111\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.920\nSo your notifications,\n\n112\n00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.450\nyou definitely want to make sure\nthat you've got them turned on.\n\n113\n00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.140\nNow a couple of the other\nthings I want to talk about.\n\n114\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.740\nAnd like I said we're gonna\nget into some scans here but\n\n115\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.770\nhow about setting up a scan?\n\n116\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.140\nYou might want some criteria\nbefore you even go to the scans.\n\n117\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.230\nSo there's a detection and protection.\n\n118\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.505\nLet me go ahead and show you guys.\n\n119\n00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:54.635\nDown here towards the side, you've got\nall of the individual configurations.\n\n120\n00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:56.135\nWe're gonna look at some\nof these coming up.\n\n121\n00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:58.545\nBut this first one is detection and\nprotection.\n\n122\n00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:03.030\nAnd when you choose this, let me go also\ngo ahead and say that, when you do like\n\n123\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.081\na customized scan, and you're gonna see\nthat coming up, it'll give you this again.\n\n124\n00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:11.412\nThis is for if you're doing a quick scan,\nif you just wanna rifle thru,\n\n125\n00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.900\nyou could set some of\nthe default settings.\n\n126\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.950\nOne of the cool things here is\nthey have here heuristics engines,\n\n127\n00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.630\nwe've talked about, we've set\nthe stage for what heuristics is,\n\n128\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.910\nif I don't know what a virus is,\nif they're unknown viruses right.\n\n129\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.655\nMike, the zero day exploits, that we're\nnot even aware of, this is good to have.\n\n130\n00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:29.735\nAnd you can see their name here.\n\n131\n00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:32.658\nIt always reminds me of that\nold video game Shenobi.\n\n132\n00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.805\n[LAUGH] So we got rootkits too.\n\n133\n00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:38.595\nAnd so it can do very good\nearly warning detection.\n\n134\n00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:40.517\nAnd then of course you've\ngot your PUP detection.\n\n135\n00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:41.600\nIn here.\nNow, we're not looking for\n\n136\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.241\npuppies here, guys.\n\n137\n00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:42.841\n>> No.\n\n138\n00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:47.487\n>> [LAUGH] ln fact, I want to say\nit was McAfee back in like 2002,\n\n139\n00:06:47.487 --> 00:06:53.437\n2001 that actually coined this term,\npotentially unwanted programs.\n\n140\n00:06:53.437 --> 00:06:55.287\nWell, what are potentially\nunwanted programs?\n\n141\n00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:59.967\nSome of the malware we've already talked\nabout, things like spyware, your adware,\n\n142\n00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:04.930\nand they even lump sometimes the Trojan\nhorse under potentially unwanted\n\n143\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.860\nprograms and you can see, treat them as\nmalware and that's always a good thing.\n\n144\n00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.550\nIs your RealTime on, you want malware\nprotection turn on and then they have also\n\n145\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.430\ngot that's really cool feature here to\na malicious website protection now.\n\n146\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.840\nLet's be honest here,\n\n147\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.040\na lot of your web browsers have this\nintegrated into their own databases.\n\n148\n00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.630\nSo if I'm using Internet Explorer.\n\n149\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.980\nChrome, or Firefox or\neven Safari out there.\n\n150\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.970\nThey can call out to\nthe vendors database there.\n\n151\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.550\nAnd a reputation database just means that\nif you're on that list, chances are your\n\n152\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.485\nwebsite is being flagged by all\nthe browsers as being a malicious and\n\n153\n00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:40.795\nsome kind of attack or so.\n\n154\n00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.105\nMike, when it comes to setting\nup some of the basic settings,\n\n155\n00:07:43.105 --> 00:07:44.486\nnot too difficult here.\n\n156\n00:07:44.486 --> 00:07:46.319\n[CROSSTALK] You just have to\nremember that gear icon and\n\n157\n00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.321\neverything's done on left-hand\nside once you get here.\n\n158\n00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:49.655\nSo it should be pretty easy.\n\n159\n00:07:49.655 --> 00:07:51.245\n>> Yeah.\nVery similar to the other ones we've seen\n\n160\n00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:54.010\nalready like Windows Defender and\nthings like that,\n\n161\n00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.400\na lot of the common settings, right?\n\n162\n00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.280\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n163\n00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.644\nAnd speaking of some common settings too,\nlet's go ahead and talk about exclusions.\n\n164\n00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:01.189\nAll right, here's another one,\n\n165\n00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.437\nfairly easy,\nyou can see it all the way at the top.\n\n166\n00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:07.476\nSee, you have general settings too and\nI tell you what, before we get into.\n\n167\n00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:08.126\nExclusions.\nWell,\n\n168\n00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:09.797\nthe general settings is\nwe've already looked at.\n\n169\n00:08:09.797 --> 00:08:11.310\nThat's the notifications here.\n\n170\n00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.400\nExclusions, right?\n\n171\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.550\nMike's already, you've been with one\nof the episodes where we talking about\n\n172\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.300\nI know you work heavily in security and\nyou're doing security testing, right?\n\n173\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.940\nYou might have potentially quarantines\nviruses on your computer for\n\n174\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.920\nthe purposes of testing it in\na virtualized environment.\n\n175\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.330\nWell if you're just doing research,\nwhich that's what we're doing,\n\n176\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.980\njust doing research.\n\n177\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:39.600\nHow do you make sure that these\nantivirus programs don't quarantine\n\n178\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.350\nwhat is legitimately a box of rattlesnakes\non your computer and get rid of it.\n\n179\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.080\nThen you can't get access\nto that information.\n\n180\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.670\nSo if I did have a situation like that\nwhere maybe I did want to add a folder.\n\n181\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.960\nI could do that and I could point to the\nlocation of that, any of those situation.\n\n182\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.780\nSometimes, they look for certain strings,\ntoo, and you might find that\n\n183\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.260\nstring data in there and end up completely\ndeleting and hosing up your research.\n\n184\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.590\n>> I love that option cuz,\n\n185\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.220\nas you said, I've got some things\nthat most of these will flag or\n\n186\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.610\nwill try to quarantine or even\n>> Depending on the severity level just\n\n187\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.410\nflat out remove from my computer\nbefore I get a chance to stop it.\n\n188\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.660\nAnd way back in the past, before we had\nthese kind of programs that had that\n\n189\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.940\nexclusion capability, I would be forced\nto just not run any anti virus software.\n\n190\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.800\nWhich wasn't the safest thing to do, so\nnow I can keep my system safe and yet\n\n191\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.620\nstill have my tools that\nsometimes get flagged.\n\n192\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.220\n>> That's true, and you know,\nwith tools like that, you might say, well,\n\n193\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.350\nwhat's the big deal, just copy them\nback down and transfer them again.\n\n194\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.070\nWhen you're doing security research like\nthat, it's hard to come by those tools\n\n195\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.640\nbecause they're not just\ngiving it out to everybody.\n\n196\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.720\nYou know,\na lot of the time it's waiver based, so\n\n197\n00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.190\nit could be a nightmare trying\nto get that stuff back.\n\n198\n00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.290\nSo it's a good thing to\nhave ahead of time, so\n\n199\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.250\nyou don't inadvertently wipe out\ninformation that potentially you need.\n\n200\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.830\nNow the other one I want to look at\ntoo is something really cool that's\n\n201\n00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.510\nbuilt into this.\n\n202\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.470\nNow we've talked about this also in other\nepisodes, but if you haven't seen those\n\n203\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.720\nepisodes maybe this is the first\ntime you're listening to us.\n\n204\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.170\nOn this episode here this is\nthe self-protection module.\n\n205\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.740\nYou can see some of the advanced settings,\nbut I really wanna look at that one there.\n\n206\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.690\nWe know that root kits,\nwe know that boot loader viruses,\n\n207\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.545\nall of those like to start before\nthe antivirus software even kicks in.\n\n208\n00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:16.770\nThat's why it's very hard to tell.\n\n209\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.315\nNow don't get me wrong,\nwe've got other great standards out the,\n\n210\n00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:23.810\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface,\nyour firmware platform.\n\n211\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.620\nIf you've got a trusted platform model,\nyou got some of the hardware,\n\n212\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.740\nyou can take advantage of things\nlike secure boot up there,\n\n213\n00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.951\nwhich doesn't matter what\noperating system you are.\n\n214\n00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:33.145\nIt's an industry-wide firmware standard.\n\n215\n00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:34.695\nYou could take if you're in Windows,\n\n216\n00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:37.125\nWindows has got the early\nlaunch anti-malware ELAM.\n\n217\n00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.995\nThey call it ELAM system drivers.\n\n218\n00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:42.495\nAnd what it does, it tries to inspect the\nsystem drivers before they even get loaded\n\n219\n00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:45.565\nin at your boot start,\nbecause things like root kits,\n\n220\n00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:51.065\nthey like to put themselves in there and\nstart modifying system files.\n\n221\n00:10:51.065 --> 00:10:55.610\nSo this is kind of like this,\nit's a self protection module but more so\n\n222\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.740\nthis is protecting itself,\njust like it says.\n\n223\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.830\nYou don't want things like root kits,\nand these infections, these boot loader\n\n224\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.400\nviruses to turn around and\nshut down your anti-virus software, right.\n\n225\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.945\nAnd they can do that if they get,\nlike we say root user access or\n\n226\n00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:12.765\nthey get Windows system\nadministrative access, you know.\n\n227\n00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:13.655\nIt can cause a problem.\n\n228\n00:11:13.655 --> 00:11:17.045\nSo this is really Malwarebytes'\nway of protecting itself, so\n\n229\n00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:20.165\nits a good advanced feature there that\nI'd just like to point out there.\n\n230\n00:11:20.165 --> 00:11:26.480\nSo, a lot of cool things that we can do\ninside of our anti virus software here.\n\n231\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.780\nNow you might have seen that when we\nstarted out, the moment it connected.\n\n232\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.151\nI gotta be careful, cuz I said it won't\nconnect outbound, and the first thing it\n\n233\n00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:38.450\ndid, connected out to the\n>> [LAUGH] Database now.\n\n234\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.362\nIt doesn't have to do that, like I said,\nyou get a lot in the database.\n\n235\n00:11:42.362 --> 00:11:47.578\nBut 350,000 potential new\npieces of code a week.\n\n236\n00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:51.440\nChances are their, that the security\ngunners are always chasing their tails\n\n237\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.190\ntrying to stay ahead of the hackers.\n\n238\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.920\nSo, how effective that is is\nalways contingent on, I guess,\n\n239\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.660\nwhat kind of fire is he gonna have.\n\n240\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.250\nOne of the things that I do wanna show\nyou though, is the updating in general.\n\n241\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.690\nBecause you really need to know how\nto do that, one of the good things,\n\n242\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.470\nlike I said, is that it will connect,\nbut it's based on these settings.\n\n243\n00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.410\nNotice it says,\n\n244\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.860\nnotify the user if the database is what,\nseven days, seven days out of date?\n\n245\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.590\nWell, why is that that big of a deal?\n\n246\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.260\nSeven days, you say, well,\nI updated it last week.\n\n247\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.350\nWhat's the problem?\n\n248\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.692\nWell, remember the concepts that\nwe've talked about, zero day viruses.\n\n249\n00:12:23.692 --> 00:12:24.981\nRight, if it's a zero-day virus,\n\n250\n00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:26.658\nit doesn't matter what\nyou did seven days ago.\n\n251\n00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:29.856\nToday it was discovered by\nsomebody that's not telling you.\n\n252\n00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:33.825\nAnd the problem is, big problem is,\nthose zero-day viruses\n\n253\n00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:37.881\ncan exploit hundreds of thousands\nof computers very quickly.\n\n254\n00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:41.750\nCuz nobody's aware of any kinds of checks\nand balances in order to protect that.\n\n255\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.496\nSo this is a really good thing to have.\n\n256\n00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:47.730\nNow, this is not so\nmuch about the database, as you can see.\n\n257\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.130\nThis is the antivirus software itself.\n\n258\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.470\nHave they found bugs?\n\n259\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.580\nPotential problems with\ntheir own software.\n\n260\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.130\nYou want to keep their\nsoftware updated as well.\n\n261\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.330\nSo, both of them here right Mike,\nthe database and the program itself.\n\n262\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.610\nAnd then,\nif you're in a internally managed system,\n\n263\n00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.810\nwhere maybe you don't want\nthis one connecting outbound.\n\n264\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.920\nWell they also allow the ability\nthat if you want to set up a proxy,\n\n265\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.820\nyou can do that.\n\n266\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.740\nAnd then you have to set up your proxy\ninformation server and port, so.\n\n267\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.290\nUpdating, again, is one of those\nthings that it's not too difficult,\n\n268\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.525\njust make sure that you have\nthese settings configured.\n\n269\n00:13:20.525 --> 00:13:22.425\nIf you wanna be a little bit\nmore restrictive, you can,\n\n270\n00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:23.865\nit's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n271\n00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:25.505\nIt's gonna check based on your settings.\n\n272\n00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:26.925\nAnd if you've opened this up and\n\n273\n00:13:26.925 --> 00:13:30.045\nif you haven't opened it up in seven days\nit's gonna connect automatically there.\n\n274\n00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:31.805\nSo fairly easy on that one.\n\n275\n00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:34.195\n>> All right, so\nwe got our malware bytes installed.\n\n276\n00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:35.325\nWe've got it configured.\n\n277\n00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:36.195\nWhat's our next step there?\n\n278\n00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:36.712\n>> That's right.\nSo\n\n279\n00:13:36.712 --> 00:13:39.719\nI think we should just kinda look at some\nof the basic scans that you can do, right?\n\n280\n00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:43.560\nSo let's go ahead and the scan\nbutton is up here at the top guys.\n\n281\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.590\nAnd again it's not too difficult to find.\n\n282\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.140\nHowever one of the things that you\nmight not see right off the bat and\n\n283\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.420\nyou can always read these guys,\nthey've got really good definitions here.\n\n284\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.330\nThat you can look at.\n\n285\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.200\nLet's see if I can get all of them in the\nscreen there, so hyper scan, threat scan,\n\n286\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.700\ncustom scan.\n\n287\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.800\nWhat does this mean?\n\n288\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.890\nWell the threat scan is all-inclusive.\n\n289\n00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.790\nI think of that as kind\nof like the full scan.\n\n290\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.760\nThey just call it a threat scan.\n\n291\n00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.520\nIt's gonna look at pretty\nmuch a comprehensive set\n\n292\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.660\nof locations on your computer.\n\n293\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.810\nThe hyper scan is called that\nbecause it is a quick scan.\n\n294\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.880\nAnd that's probably why\nthey call it a hyper scan.\n\n295\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.440\nIt's like your quick scans in some\nof your other antivirus software.\n\n296\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.160\nOne of the things that I think is really\ncool about this is they tell you if you\n\n297\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.030\nwant to get the complete use out of this.\n\n298\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.255\nWhat they say is, start with a threat\nscan, and then once that's done,\n\n299\n00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:34.875\nbump over and do a hyper scan.\n\n300\n00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:39.325\nAnd for some reason I guess that gives you\nthe most complete detailed, it's because\n\n301\n00:14:39.325 --> 00:14:43.915\nthe shared or running objects in memory,\nI think, is what it has to do with.\n\n302\n00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:45.545\nAnd then the last one is the custom scan,\nand\n\n303\n00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:47.535\nthis is the one that we're\ngonna focus on here.\n\n304\n00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:50.315\nAnd once you select it,\nit doesn't start the scan.\n\n305\n00:14:50.315 --> 00:14:53.700\nSo we can choose configure,\nconfigure the scan.\n\n306\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.720\nAnd remember that interface I\nwas showing you, I said hey,\n\n307\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.410\nyou can configure your\ndefault settings for a scan.\n\n308\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.940\nThat would be what would\neffect my threat scan.\n\n309\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.770\nHere, any time I set up a customized scan,\nthey're gonna give you that option,\n\n310\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.520\nit's no different.\n\n311\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.460\nSo for instance,\nyou can see your pups are there.\n\n312\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.490\nIf I do rootkits, and then I can pick.\n\n313\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.900\nWhich location I wanna use.\n\n314\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.450\nSo for instance if I wanted to,\ncuz I'm logged in as user01 here,\n\n315\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.630\nif I wanted to do a desktop scan,\nI could do that right now.\n\n316\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.450\nI could choose scan now and it's gonna go\nthrough a process, it's gonna check for\n\n317\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.950\nupdates, it's gonna do some\npre-scan operations here.\n\n318\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.750\nAnd then as they go through here, in fact\nI'll let it run in the background just so\n\n319\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.850\nyou guys can see this,\nright, scanning for rootkit,\n\n320\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.300\nscanning your memory startup files,\nregistry, and then scanning system files.\n\n321\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.470\nAnd then the last one over here while it's\nstill running is the heuristics analysis,\n\n322\n00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.650\nso at the end it's gonna say I'm gonna\nbase all the other scans on what\n\n323\n00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.710\nI do know.\n\n324\n00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.672\nAnd then once I can figure out that\nthere's nothing on that machine about what\n\n325\n00:15:52.672 --> 00:15:53.456\nI do know at the end.\n\n326\n00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:57.863\nWe'll used that advanced heuristic\nengines to do the checks and balances and\n\n327\n00:15:57.863 --> 00:16:02.130\nweigh the likelihood that maybe a string\nof data is gonna act like a virus and\n\n328\n00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.843\nit'll look at the code here.\n\n329\n00:16:03.843 --> 00:16:09.100\nSo when it comes down to it,\nso far we seem to be good.\n\n330\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.959\nWe don't have anything there.\n\n331\n00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:11.816\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So far.\n\n332\n00:16:11.816 --> 00:16:14.200\n>> Well, that's good.\n>> Yeah, that's always a good thing.\n\n333\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.030\nOne of the other things\nthat I mention here\n\n334\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.580\nwhen it comes to malware bytes\nis how to schedule scans, right?\n\n335\n00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.410\nWe might want to.\n\n336\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.460\nWell, you would want to be\nable to schedule a scan.\n\n337\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.900\nBecause, remember,\nif you install any virus software.\n\n338\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.750\nAnd you don't use it, the only thing\nthat's benefiting you is the real time\n\n339\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.130\nprotection, but there again, if you're\nnot using heuristics in your scans,\n\n340\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.210\ncuz you're not doing your scans, that even\nsome of those bugs can get by as well.\n\n341\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.190\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and cancel this\nscan here, and I'll show you guys.\n\n342\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.780\nWe'll come back to that in a second.\n\n343\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.500\nWe got a little treat here for you.\n\n344\n00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.820\nBut setting up scans, not too bad.\n\n345\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.699\nThere is an automated scheduling\nsection that you can see over here.\n\n346\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.690\nAll right, fairly easy to do.\n\n347\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.140\nAnd I want I like about this is\nit's fairly intuitive, you know?\n\n348\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.300\nThey don't really hide\na lot of the stuff here.\n\n349\n00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.660\nAnd we have an automated scan,\nnotice that we've already got some here.\n\n350\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.590\nNow, these are system defined ones and\nyou can see the updates,\n\n351\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.370\nyou can see when was the last\ntime that it did this.\n\n352\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:15.450\nYou can see the threat scan,\nit says it's a daily scan.\n\n353\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.940\nWell, maybe I don't want a daily scan.\n\n354\n00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.970\nOr, if I do want a daily scan,\nmaybe they picked a time that's right in\n\n355\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.780\nthe middle of when I'm trying to do\nsomething, and that's when you can change\n\n356\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.190\nyour schedule around, and\nyou can get very, very specific on it.\n\n357\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.120\nYou can say whether you want a threat\nscan When you want it to start.\n\n358\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.820\nDate, time, and then how often\ndo you want this to re-occur.\n\n359\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.420\nAnd again, fairly easy.\n\n360\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:43.120\nAnd then going into the advanced, it asks\nyou when you are scheduling these scans.\n\n361\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.550\nWell if you've, let's say that you're\nworried about the scan going off in\n\n362\n00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.430\nthe middle of somebody\nlike using Photoshop and\n\n363\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.250\nyou're worried about CPU utilization.\n\n364\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.140\nWell, you might schedule it for\noff hours, right, sometime after six,\n\n365\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.510\nor if you've got a night crew,\nmaybe even two in the morning.\n\n366\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.240\nWell, what happens if that scan goes\noff at two in the morning and boom,\n\n367\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.690\nit catches a virus,\nwhat do we want to do with it?\n\n368\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.460\nRight, do we want to let\nit sit on our machine,\n\n369\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.740\nsit idle there and\nhope it doesn't go any farther?\n\n370\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.960\nWell, any threats are found, you can\nalways quarantine too and there again,\n\n371\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.360\njust like setting up a customs camp,\nyou can always you can always scan for\n\n372\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.660\nthe root kits, too.\n\n373\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.830\nAnd then you have the logging options and\nthat's great for auditing.\n\n374\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.310\nIn a small, small environment\nyou might wanna audit these.\n\n375\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.200\nYou might wanna audit them locally.\n\n376\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.420\nBut, again, remember if you turn on\nlogging And you tell it the path,\n\n377\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.670\nhe logs in another selves can become\nperformance endurances because if we\n\n378\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.540\nturn it on right, it is going to generate\nlogs but if you don't turn around and\n\n379\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.170\nuse them again it is really\nno different than installing\n\n380\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.920\nthe software on your computer\nthan not using it at all.\n\n381\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.730\nPay attention to the logs and I know that\nyou're aware of that too on your servers\n\n382\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:54.520\nit can happen really really quick so\nautomated scheduling is not too difficult.\n\n383\n00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.830\nFor the most part,\nthe interface is really cool.\n\n384\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.690\n>> Yeah it's something you really need\nto do because I don't know about you\n\n385\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.030\nguys out there.\n\n386\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.870\nI'll forget.\n\n387\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.790\nI know I have great intentions I'm\ngoing to run that scan every hour,\n\n388\n00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.030\nI'm going to run that scan every day.\n\n389\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.690\nI'm gonna forget that, so\nif I can schedule it, and\n\n390\n00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.010\nit can take care of running it on\nthat schedule, I'm good to go.\n\n391\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.440\n>> Yeah, definitely, and now there\nare a few other things that, bells and\n\n392\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.835\nwhistles that this has, we've talked.\n\n393\n00:19:19.835 --> 00:19:21.105\n>> They've said there's the free version.\n\n394\n00:19:21.105 --> 00:19:23.425\n>> I've used the free version a lot,\nand it's really done its job.\n\n395\n00:19:23.425 --> 00:19:25.685\nAnd it's come in handy\nwhen I've needed it, too.\n\n396\n00:19:25.685 --> 00:19:28.495\nBut there are some other\nthings that you get in here,\n\n397\n00:19:28.495 --> 00:19:30.985\nthat you don't get with a free version.\n\n398\n00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:32.915\nI like the access policies too.\n\n399\n00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:36.785\nNow, the access policies, not exactly if\nyou get this with the free version or not.\n\n400\n00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:41.020\nBut one of the great things about this is,\nwho do I want To manage this.\n\n401\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.110\nRight?\nIf you're in a small environment,\n\n402\n00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.560\nlet's say you got five computers and\nmaybe you're supporting a very,\n\n403\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.050\nvery small environment or\nmaybe it's a home environment.\n\n404\n00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.840\nIf I'm the administrator do I want\nto give somebody else access to\n\n405\n00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.560\nbe able to configure Malwarebytes?\n\n406\n00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.270\nRight?\nI don't want somebody that maybe isn't\n\n407\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.190\nin the know.\n\n408\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.530\nTo get administrative level\naccess to malware bites and\n\n409\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.430\nthey're having a problem with\none of their applications.\n\n410\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.690\nAs we always know, the proverbial\nsaying if the application breaks\n\n411\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.270\nturn off the firewall,\nturn off the antivirus software.\n\n412\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.660\nYou've got to be good right.\n\n413\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.060\nI'm just kidding guys, I seriously\nthough but, it does happen right?\n\n414\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.180\nAnd you've probably seen this before so\nyou have to be careful on who you give\n\n415\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.720\naccess to the administrative control\nbecause if they don't know how to use\n\n416\n00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.800\nit the right way they might do more harm\nthan good so That's really up to you.\n\n417\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.700\nWeb exclusions right.\n\n418\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.870\nWe can shut down entire domains.\n\n419\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:35.720\nSo, maybe you don't want,\nI mean think of kids.\n\n420\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.250\nWe want them to be safe when\nthey're out there on the internet.\n\n421\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.060\nAnd this might be safe in the way that if\nyou do find something you don't want them\n\n422\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.680\ngoing to you can lock it down.\n\n423\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.430\nYou gotta go a little bit farther and\nyou're going to get a little more\n\n424\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.990\nspecific on this,\nlike you can do it by IP address as well.\n\n425\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.410\nSo, it might be something\nthat you want to do.\n\n426\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.810\nThe other thing, too,\nis you could exclude processes as well.\n\n427\n00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:01.970\nThings that interact with web, I guess\nyou could say web-based applications too.\n\n428\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.500\nSo again, all really,\nreally Cool stuff here that you can do.\n\n429\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.110\nI really like it.\n\n430\n00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.420\nThe last thing I'll\nprobably say is history.\n\n431\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.350\nHere's where your quarantines come.\n\n432\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.950\nAnd that's probably a good thing.\n\n433\n00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.220\nIf I show you guys how to do set up your\nscheduling and you do schedule it and\n\n434\n00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.540\nit quarantines something on Friday\nnight after everyone's gone or\n\n435\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.360\nmaybe you're not at your house.\n\n436\n00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.450\nYou wanna know where that\nlies when you come back and\n\n437\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.380\nit says you get some kind of warning,\nyou come here and you check your logs, and\n\n438\n00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.530\nif you do have anything in here,\nyou can always delete it.\n\n439\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.750\nYou can delete it all, or\nif it's a false positive.\n\n440\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.860\nYou're using that advanced\nheuristic engine and\n\n441\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.480\nlet's say it does flag something\nthat's something you need.\n\n442\n00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.970\nLike Mike was talking earlier\nwith the security software.\n\n443\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.920\nHey, it quarantined it But my action\ndidn't say delete it, so it's still there.\n\n444\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.620\nWell, I might come in here, or Mike might\ncome in here and say, hey you know what,\n\n445\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.360\nthat's my security software and\nit's flagging it as a virus so\n\n446\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.170\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna click restore.\n\n447\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.630\nHowever, be careful because\nif it does it's job and\n\n448\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:02.300\nyou're restoring the wrong file,\nwell then you got a problem because\n\n449\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.270\nit might see it, it could,\nI gotta be careful, it could see it and\n\n450\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.710\nsay, no you told me not\nto quarantine that.\n\n451\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.280\nAnd it really is a virus.\n\n452\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.600\nThe other thing on the application\nlogs that you can see here too so\n\n453\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.240\nthese are really good if\nyou have generated a scan,\n\n454\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.880\nyou could see when the scan happened.\n\n455\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.490\nIf you are automating it right and\n\n456\n00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.390\nyou are setting it at two in the morning,\nyou certainly don't want to be up in\n\n457\n00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.450\ntwo in the morning to find\nout if a scan is running.\n\n458\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.980\nBut you do want to check the log and\nmake sure that the scan did run and\n\n459\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.040\nit completed successfully.\n\n460\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.340\nAll fairly good stuff though, Mike.\n\n461\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.960\n>> Yeah.\n\n462\n00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.910\n>> Like I said I really this software.\n\n463\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.610\nI like the head's up feature.\n\n464\n00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.760\nIt's not too complex to work with and\nthey've kept it very basic and\n\n465\n00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.970\nvery streamlined.\n\n466\n00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.210\n>> It's one of my favorites just because,\nlike you said, it's light weight.\n\n467\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.800\nIt doesn't take a lot of resources.\n\n468\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.290\nIf I'm at somebody's house trying to\nhelp them or something like that,\n\n469\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:58.310\nI can download it really quick, get it\ninstalled, and typically find most of it.\n\n470\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.160\nYou saw in their update options\nit was updating, by default,\n\n471\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.810\nit was gonna do it every hour.\n\n472\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.240\nTo me, if I see something\nthat's gonna reach out and\n\n473\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.140\nget new definitions every hour, that\ntells me that they must be putting out\n\n474\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.770\ndefinitions quite often, right, or they\nwouldn't have it checking in every hour.\n\n475\n00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.550\nIf they were only putting out updates\nevery week why have a check in every hour?\n\n476\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.550\nSo, you know this is a company\nthat's on the ball and\n\n477\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.150\nthey're putting out those new\ndefinitions as soon as they get them and\n\n478\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.560\nthey're making it available to us which is\njust gonna help me keep my system safe.\n\n479\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.070\nAnd again the whole fact that it you know\nyou could schedule it you could set it and\n\n480\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.360\nforget it is really nice.\n\n481\n00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.000\nIt has the real time protection So\nlike for\n\n482\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.100\nfree solutions it's on my top list and.\n\n483\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.770\n>> You better believe it.\n\n484\n00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.240\n>> And the papers is very good, too.\n\n485\n00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.150\nIf you want to get to that\nnext level of support with\n\n486\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.650\nthem you can get that paid version and\nit's great as well.\n\n487\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.000\n>> Not to say that any one company\ndoesn't take their company serious but\n\n488\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.380\nMow Wear Bytes they definitely\ntake their definitions,\n\n489\n00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.270\nthey data base very seriously.\n\n490\n00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:01.990\nYou could see that in the reduced\namount of time that you can do updates.\n\n491\n00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.290\nAnd even initiating updates\nwhen you're doing a scan, too.\n\n492\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.550\nIt's really cool.\n\n493\n00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.638\nMike, what do you say we take\nthis thing for a spin and\n\n494\n00:24:08.638 --> 00:24:10.217\nsee if it's actually doing it's job.\n\n495\n00:24:10.217 --> 00:24:12.769\nSee if it'll put it's\nmoney where it's mouth is.\n\n496\n00:24:12.769 --> 00:24:14.070\n>> Let's test it.\nLet's do it.\n\n497\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.428\n>> On this next part, you have to be very\ncareful Careful if you're gonna do this on\n\n498\n00:24:18.428 --> 00:24:22.660\nyour own machine because what we do\nhave here is, we do have a live virus.\n\n499\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.150\nSo this machine you have to understand,\nis quarantined, it's in virtualization.\n\n500\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.710\nSo if you are test-betting these,\nagain, you have to be careful.\n\n501\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.580\nSo let's go ahead, let's do that.\n\n502\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.862\nI'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna\npull out a box of rattlesnakes here.\n\n503\n00:24:36.862 --> 00:24:40.140\nAnd we're gonna see if we\ncan infect this machine.\n\n504\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:45.400\nNow this is a good way to test the real\ntime protection of this machine.\n\n505\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.350\nYou guys out there might\nhave noticed before, and\n\n506\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.280\nyou can see it right here if I can\nzoom in on that before it disappears.\n\n507\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.380\nIt did catch it, sure enough.\n\n508\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.360\nIt found it, right away.\n\n509\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.086\nNow, if you guys are out there testing,\nwe've talked about in other episodes,\n\n510\n00:25:01.086 --> 00:25:03.878\nwe've talked about that file to test.\n\n511\n00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:05.816\nWell Malware doesn't keep\nthat in their database.\n\n512\n00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:09.758\nSo don't think, if you have been\nwatching those other shows and\n\n513\n00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:13.630\nyou're like I want to test\nMalware Bytes and see how good it is.\n\n514\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.330\nAnd then you run that file and\nit doesn't catch it.\n\n515\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.140\nAnd then you run it again and\nit doesn't catch it and\n\n516\n00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.930\nthere's other versions of it like .com and\njust the virus string itself.\n\n517\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.690\nMalware Bytes plainly says\nwe're working on real viruses.\n\n518\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.390\nSo it's not in there.\n\n519\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.170\nThere are other ways to, and\nyou can see, cuz like I say this\n\n520\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.850\nis a real virus here and it found it\nright away and it said it's blocked.\n\n521\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.640\nSo one of the things we can do\nis we can go into our history.\n\n522\n00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.120\nIt doesn't seem like it's there yet.\n\n523\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.460\nI'll tell you what, let's do a scan here.\n\n524\n00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.340\nAnd looks like that's finished.\n\n525\n00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.400\nMight have to close the program down.\n\n526\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.680\nI tell you what, we'll run it again,\nsee if we can generate some logs here.\n\n527\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.780\nCuz it should be in the quarantine log.\n\n528\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.475\nAnd I might have to take action on it.\n\n529\n00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:58.045\nSo and that's another thing, that's why\nit's good to check the logs itself and\n\n530\n00:25:58.045 --> 00:26:00.575\nwe're just gonna see if\nit'll catch it again.\n\n531\n00:26:00.575 --> 00:26:02.815\nLike I said it's really good and\nI, yep there it is.\n\n532\n00:26:02.815 --> 00:26:09.035\nI probably took a little bit too long on\nthat one and we'll see if there it is.\n\n533\n00:26:09.035 --> 00:26:12.145\nIt showed up all right and\nit's asking me right now.\n\n534\n00:26:12.145 --> 00:26:16.630\nIt's saying, hey we found something,\nwhat do you want to do with this?\n\n535\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.450\nNotice it hasn't done anything yet, right?\n\n536\n00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.380\nCuz if this was a false positive,\nwell we want Mike to be\n\n537\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.590\nable to restore that security class\nsoftware before it just wipes it out.\n\n538\n00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.840\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll see it's quarantined now and\n\n539\n00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.970\nwe'll see if we can delete it.\n\n540\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.260\nAnd hopefully, yeah, there it goes.\n\n541\n00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.100\nIt's gone.\n\n542\n00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.860\nWe'll check our application logs.\n\n543\n00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.860\nEverything looks good.\n\n544\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.360\nYep, let's see here,\nprotection, there we go.\n\n545\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.530\nSo, you could find it in logs real quick,\ntoo, so sure enough it found it.\n\n546\n00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:45.930\nAnd those are the logs\nthat we're talking about.\n\n547\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.910\nYou wanna be able to check them, go back.\n\n548\n00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.620\nBecause if it quarantines and\nyou've got a default action,\n\n549\n00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.500\nwhich you can on some of these\nsoftware where it says default action,\n\n550\n00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.220\nseverity level high,\nquarantine it and remove it.\n\n551\n00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.370\nWell if I'm not aware,\nI might come in here and\n\n552\n00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.780\nwhat if I find 13 entries\nall within 5 minutes.\n\n553\n00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.260\nOr I find 20 entries over the next hour.\n\n554\n00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.790\nIt might see that this is a target attack,\nand\n\n555\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.580\nit could be based on browsing habits or\nwho have you.\n\n556\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.490\nWorms they sit outside of your\nconnectivity devices, right, and\n\n557\n00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.050\nthey wait for port of entry.\n\n558\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.120\nAnd if they find port of entry,\nthey exploit it.\n\n559\n00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.440\nAnd then they replicate themselves.\n\n560\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.170\nAnd they don't just\nreplicate themselves once,\n\n561\n00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.030\nthey do it until all\nthe resources are consumed.\n\n562\n00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.990\nSo you might come in here and\nyou might find something like this,\n\n563\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.300\nwhere you just see minute after minute\nafter minute this thing is protecting you\n\n564\n00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.380\nand deleting stuff.\n\n565\n00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.980\nSo, again,\nmake sure that you check those logs.\n\n566\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.190\nBut it looks like Malwarebytes\nhas done its job here.\n\n567\n00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.020\n>> Yeah.\n>> It caught it twice and, well,\n\n568\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.160\nthank goodness.\n\n569\n00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.950\nMike's banking information is safe and\nWes doesn't get to go to Newegg tonight or\n\n570\n00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:42.531\nanything like that.\n\n571\n00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:43.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.480\n>> But yeah, it did it's job and\n\n573\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.080\nI'm happy with it.\nI really like it and so good stuff.\n\n574\n00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.770\n>> All right Wes,\n\n575\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.520\nwell a lot of great information there\non anti-virus, anti-malware, and\n\n576\n00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.130\ntaking a look at one of the many\ngreat products that are out there,\n\n577\n00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.740\nthis one being Malwarebytes.\n\n578\n00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.420\nAnd walking us through,\ngetting that setup, so\n\n579\n00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.170\nI can keep my machine and whoever I'm\nsupporting, I'll keep those machines safe.\n\n580\n00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.300\nSo great information there.\n\n581\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.040\nAny parting words for our viewers?\n\n582\n00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.150\n>> No.\nYou know Mike,\n\n583\n00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.390\nthe only thing I might say is that you\ndon't have to use the premium version\n\n584\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.430\non this one.\n\n585\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.830\nIt's a personal opinion,\nI really like this one.\n\n586\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.880\nRemember it's lightweight,\nput it on thumb drive, and\n\n587\n00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.990\nif you don't need, don't want\nnetwork access to your computers,\n\n588\n00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.990\na lot of times you can quarantine it\nwithout even updating the database.\n\n589\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.930\nBut other than that,\nI think they do a good job.\n\n590\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:23.450\n>> Very good.\n\n591\n00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.920\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n592\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.500\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n593\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.240\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n594\n00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.269\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n595\n00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:35.170\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.040\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.850\nAnd today we're gonna be going into\nthe world of Anti-virus, and anti-malware,\n\n6\n00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.040\nand specifically a program called Avast,\nor Avast Premier actually.\n\n7\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.120\nAnd with us today is Mr. Wes Bryan\nto help us navigate these waters.\n\n8\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.730\nHow you doing Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.590\n>> I'm doing great,\nit's great to be back here Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.970\nThank you for having me back on stage.\n\n11\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.230\nAnd we're gonna be moving along in\nour Consumer Grade Antivirus episode.\n\n12\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.020\nAnd we've gone through a few of them so\nfar.\n\n13\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.170\nAnd if you haven't seen them,\ngo back and definitely check them out.\n\n14\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.330\nWe, also introduced some\nof the topics as well.\n\n15\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.290\nSo it's some of the Verbage\nthat we use here.\n\n16\n00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.110\nMaybe some of the jargon doesn't\nseem familiar to you, go back and\n\n17\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.250\nwatch those and\nit might make it a little bit easier.\n\n18\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.430\nAnd we are going to be talking about\na vast premiere so what do you say, Mike,\n\n19\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.610\nwe don't talk about it,\nwe dive right in here.\n\n20\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.540\nHow we're going to show you how to\ninstall a vast like we've been doing with\n\n21\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.470\nsome of the other software.\n\n22\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.810\nSo, I've already gone ahead and\ndownloaded exe ahead of time.\n\n23\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.850\nIt's a waiting for us already so,\nwhen you click on it,\n\n24\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.090\nkeep in mind anytime you're\ndealing with security class\n\n25\n00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.720\nsoftware you're gonna have to be\nan Administrator to be able to install it.\n\n26\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.570\nAnytime that user account control if\nyou're in Windows Triggers you'll\n\n27\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.830\ndefinitely need to be an administrator\non the local machine in order to\n\n28\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.150\ninstall this.\n\n29\n00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.140\nNow the installation here is fairly easy,\nI will tell you be careful because,\n\n30\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.610\nthey do try to throw a little extra\nin there at us, so I use chrome,\n\n31\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.750\nI use the chrome browser,\nI like it maybe you don't use chrome.\n\n32\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.310\nMaybe you use Firefox or maybe you\nuse some of the other ones out there.\n\n33\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.420\nSo if you don't use it\njust remember be careful.\n\n34\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.320\nUncheck it.\n\n35\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.700\nAnd you can also do customization here.\n\n36\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.770\nWe could go with the basic default, but I\nkind of wanna show you that with the Avast\n\n37\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.790\npremier suite here, I mean it\nreally is a suite of technologies.\n\n38\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.250\nIt's not just a single thing.\n\n39\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250\nAnd you can look at some of the things\nthat it has integrated into it.\n\n40\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.450\nNow keep in mind that we're focused\nmore in on that anti-virus side.\n\n41\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.260\nAnd we'll show you some of the bells,\nand whistles after the fact, but\n\n42\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.490\nthere's a lot of stuff that this does,\na lot of different things.\n\n43\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.240\nAnd when you go through the install\nprocess, you can see down here at\n\n44\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.770\nthe bottom it says downloading\nthe plug-ins and everything.\n\n45\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.750\nDon't turn off your computer here.\n\n46\n00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.340\nAnd it goes through the process,\nlike you can see here.\n\n47\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.400\nIt's connecting outbound,\nit's reaching out to a vast databases,\n\n48\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.890\nand it's pulling down\nthe information that you need.\n\n49\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.290\nNow, I will say that this is one that does\nrequire you to already have an account.\n\n50\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.500\nSo that being said, I've already\ngone ahead, and created an account.\n\n51\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.810\nIf you haven't created an account, that's\nokay, you're going to see here once it\n\n52\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.840\ngets started that for the most part it'll\ngive you the ability to create an account.\n\n53\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.880\nYou can log in with your own account, the\nother thing you can do too, with this one,\n\n54\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.745\nis you can also go with what's\nknown as invitation code, too.\n\n55\n00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:56.115\nSo if you do get an invitation code,\nit'll give you that option too.\n\n56\n00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:59.975\nAnd you can see it's\na fairly hefty install,\n\n57\n00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:02.145\nbased on all those choices that you have.\n\n58\n00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:06.095\nWe could probably speed it up with\njust reducing some of that, but,\n\n59\n00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:09.625\nI kinda wanna show you guys, show you\nwhat's going on with this one, and\n\n60\n00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:15.330\njust kinda introduce some of those\nother features here so, just as soon\n\n61\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.990\nas it gets done, we'll get started with\nit, and show you what it's about here.\n\n62\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.180\nMike, it took a little bit on that\none to get the software installed.\n\n63\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.220\nThere's a lot in this suite.\n\n64\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.040\nBut as you can see here,\nwe do have it installed.\n\n65\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.570\nAnd one of the things that it's gonna\nask you right here at the bottom.\n\n66\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.670\nIt says have you already\nbought this product?\n\n67\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.420\nI'm not, we're using the trial here so,\nI'm not worried about that, but\n\n68\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.390\nif you do you can put your\nactivation code in right there.\n\n69\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.130\nYou don't have to do some of\nthe other stuff that we're gonna do.\n\n70\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.520\nThis is your Privacy Agreement and\nyour End User License Agreement.\n\n71\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.850\nYou'll see here it says don't skip this,\nread it carefully.\n\n72\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.680\nSo at the end of this\nepisode we'll give Micah.\n\n73\n00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.990\nTest on the subsection A54D\nof the privacy policy.\n\n74\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.170\nJust kidding, we won't do that.\n\n75\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.880\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose continue.\n\n76\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.450\nNow, one of the cool things, too,\nis that it does have mobile protection.\n\n77\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.755\nWe have an episode coming up,\nwhere we're gonna talk just nothing about-\n\n78\n00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:06.879\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n79\n00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.630\n>> How about nothing but\nmobile technology.\n\n80\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.410\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and\nleave off on this one, guys,\n\n81\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.580\ncuz I don't wanna spoil\nthe surprise on that one.\n\n82\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.320\nI'm gonna say no,\nI don't wanna protect my Android phone.\n\n83\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.960\nNow, Mike,\nthis is something that I kinda like.\n\n84\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.020\nAnd I know that you deal with\nthis as an administrator.\n\n85\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.000\nGuys, if you see this,\nthis is really cool.\n\n86\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.500\nIt ask you, are you on a private network,\nor are you on a public network?\n\n87\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.120\nNow where would I be on a public network?\n\n88\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.030\nWell, I'm sure some of you guys have been\nto library before, maybe you brought your\n\n89\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.680\nlaptop, and you decided hey, I'm gonna\ndownload this on a public network.\n\n90\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.020\nIt's not a bad thing, right?\n\n91\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.890\nYou're on a Wi-Fi hotspot, you might not\nwant to set that to a private network,\n\n92\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.130\nif you're on those locations.\n\n93\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.000\nBut if you're on your home environment,\n\n94\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.370\nyou could set it to\na private network location.\n\n95\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.510\nNow, like I said this is what,\n\n96\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.990\nsomething like network location\nawareness inside of Windows.\n\n97\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.110\nHave you had to deal with this before?\n\n98\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.190\n>> Yeah, with Windows, of course, every\ntime you connect to a new network it's\n\n99\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.490\ngonna ask you how do you want to classify,\n\n100\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.120\ncuz it's gonna change how it\nprotects your system, right.\n\n101\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.720\nWhat firewall rules it puts in place, and\n\n102\n00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.370\nwe can actually make different\nexceptions on different profiles.\n\n103\n00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.500\nAnd it's pretty cool that we\nhave an antivirus software,\n\n104\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.370\nthat's aware of that right,\nthat's gonna look at what type of\n\n105\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.070\nnetwork you're connected to, and\nchange it's behavior based on that.\n\n106\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.360\nYou don't see that in a lot of them.\n\n107\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.790\n>> Yeah and\nanother thing that's kind of cool, and\n\n108\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.740\nI don't know if I really want to\nshow you guys this on camera, but\n\n109\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.300\nif I was to do more details here, I could\nsee not only the internal private IP\n\n110\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.780\naddress, i could see the network adaptor\n>> And the public IP address as well.\n\n111\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.510\nSo you get a lot of information here.\n\n112\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.900\nAnd they're going to ask you.\n\n113\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.700\nAnd again let's kinda rifle\nback down in here on this one.\n\n114\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.230\nNow is this a friendly network?\n\n115\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.790\nI'm not going to say it's\na friendly network, but\n\n116\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.000\nI will keep it to a private location, and\n\n117\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.220\nit will go into the first\npart of the interface.\n\n118\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.930\nNow.\n\n119\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.230\n>> This interface,\n\n120\n00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.410\nlike a lot of the interfaces\nthat we've been looking at here.\n\n121\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.380\nIt's not too complex.\n\n122\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.920\nWhen you talk about the consumer side\nof any virus, any malware software.\n\n123\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.050\nYou know, they don't want to have\nan end user get a product, and\n\n124\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.870\nthen not be able to use it at all.\n\n125\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.290\nSo they try to simplify it,\nmake it a little bit easy so\n\n126\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.450\nyou can get to a lot of the,\nyou know common tasks that you'll perform.\n\n127\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.580\nAnd I have to say this really isn't\ntoo much different from that.\n\n128\n00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.540\nOne of the things that I will\nsay is on the installation,\n\n129\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.120\nanytime your doing an install,\nwhether it's avast here,\n\n130\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.560\nwhether some of the other ones that we've\ntalked about, whichever one you like,\n\n131\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.870\njust pay attention when you do the initial\ninstallations they don't try to slip.\n\n132\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.870\nYou know some third\nparty software in there,\n\n133\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.580\nand they got a partnership\nwith somebody else there.\n\n134\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.520\nBut once that's done,\nfrom here on out Mike,\n\n135\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.420\nI mean it's really not too\ndifficult to move around from here.\n\n136\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.450\n>> Right.\nIt's one of those things especially with\n\n137\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.520\nfree versions, and trail versions that\nwe typically have to deal with where\n\n138\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.170\nthey've got to make that money somehow so\nthey've got some extra stuff in there.\n\n139\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.220\nIf you're not, if you're doing the old\nJimniy click it, next, next, next, next,\n\n140\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.790\ninstall, you end up with a few\nextra toolbars in your browser,\n\n141\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.520\nor your default browser has changed, so\ndefinitely something to keep in mind.\n\n142\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.230\n>> Yeah and with security software, guys\nthey really are pretty decent about not\n\n143\n00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.220\nbogging you down with\na lot of extra stuff.\n\n144\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.630\nYou just have to pay attention just\nto make sure that doesn't happen.\n\n145\n00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.240\nLike I said, with security class software\na lot of times they don't want to do\n\n146\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.830\nthat, because they know that's one of the\nreasons you're probably installing their\n\n147\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.830\nsoftware, is to help get a lot of that,\nthose ask toolbars and\n\n148\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.020\nall that off of there too.\n\n149\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.780\nSo, I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n150\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.700\nlet's look at some of the general\nlevel options that you can do here.\n\n151\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.215\nNow, there's that spinning.\n\n152\n00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:21.635\nWell this one actually spins,\nso that was a moving icon here.\n\n153\n00:07:21.635 --> 00:07:27.965\nBut the gear icon, is pretty typical for\nmaking changes here in settings.\n\n154\n00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:30.370\nNow to kinda look at some of\nthe things you can do here,\n\n155\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.880\nyou have reputation services here.\n\n156\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.800\nNow everyone of these little exclamation\n\n157\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.030\npoints will give you a little\nmore information on it.\n\n158\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.290\nBut let me go ahead and\nhelp you out with that.\n\n159\n00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.410\nReputation services, right,\nwhat are we talking about here?\n\n160\n00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.750\nWell we're talking about\nthings like websites.\n\n161\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.170\nWebsites, and even some programs too that\nmight be downloaded over the internet,\n\n162\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.760\nthat are in a database,\nand that reputation,\n\n163\n00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.450\nit's not a good reputation, right?\n\n164\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.210\nIt's the opposite.\n\n165\n00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.080\nIt's a bad reputation.\n\n166\n00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.601\nThey have a reputation for\nhacking systems, and fishing scams,\n\n167\n00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:00.787\nprivacy, stealing your information.\n\n168\n00:08:00.787 --> 00:08:02.900\nSpyware, adware, all of that.\n\n169\n00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.062\nAnd when you enable this what it does\nis allows the software to connect\n\n170\n00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:10.078\nto the vendors database\nwhere that reputations,\n\n171\n00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:13.260\nwhere the reputation database\nstored I should say.\n\n172\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.410\nThe other thing here they\nhave a deep screen mode.\n\n173\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.850\nThis is a little bit more CPU intensive\nand what it's gonna do it's gonna look\n\n174\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.430\ndown in things like you can go down to\nthings like archive files and stuff.\n\n175\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.220\nAnd it can do a little bit more.\n\n176\n00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.690\nLook at that code a little bit more.\n\n177\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.860\nFor instance, when we talk about\nheuristics it's not looking for\n\n178\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.660\na static signature, right?\n\n179\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.820\nIt's looking for a code, a string of\ninformation that's inside of the file so\n\n180\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.790\nwhen you do the deep scan it can do\nexactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n181\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.470\nIt can go a little bit farther in there,\n\n182\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.030\nlook in a zip file that's in a zip\nfile that's in a zip file cause they\n\n183\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.470\ntry to masquerade themselves as\nbeing nothing more than a zip folder\n\n184\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.800\nwhen it's buried down in the hierarchy\nsomewhere so pretty cool.\n\n185\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.960\nNow this is really cool.\n\n186\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.400\nI like this.\nThis is called hardened mode.\n\n187\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.893\nWe talk about another episodes like\nserver hardening and stuff don't,\n\n188\n00:08:58.893 --> 00:08:59.930\nconfuse it, right.\n\n189\n00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.040\nWhen you talk about hardening a system,\nwe talk about steering away from defaults,\n\n190\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.780\nshutting off unnecessary services.\n\n191\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.520\nInstalling antivirus software.\n\n192\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.410\nThis is a little bit different.\n\n193\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.290\nThis is for\nthe inexperienced user, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.250\nIf you have somebody that you're\ngonna help, maybe your gonna support,\n\n195\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.590\nmaybe you got a family member\nthat's got a computer, and\n\n196\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.230\nyou're always going over there helping\nthem to the best of your ability.\n\n197\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.360\nOr maybe you're even in IT,\nand you're helping them.\n\n198\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.280\nIf you have an inexperienced\nuser what this does is\n\n199\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.830\nit locks your computer\ndown a little bit more.\n\n200\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.650\nSo the concept is close but\n\n201\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.700\nit's a little bit different than what\nwe think of if you're already an IT.\n\n202\n00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.790\nHardened mode just says for the\ninexperienced user that they're probably\n\n203\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.050\nthe one that says why don't you open that\nspam that's got that attachment on it.\n\n204\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.780\nYou're gonna want to turn this\nsetting on for that definitely.\n\n205\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.630\nAnd then you also have your pup scans\nhere too and again you can see there,\n\n206\n00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.360\nremember just a potentially\nunwanted program again just\n\n207\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.000\ngenerically classified as things like\nspyware, adware, and even Trojan horses.\n\n208\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.830\nNow this is kind of cool, this is called\nsilent and gaming mode, this doesn't mean\n\n209\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.040\nyou're gonna open this up and there's\ngonna be a game somewhere inside of it.\n\n210\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.470\nWhat this means is if you turn that on,\n\n211\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.880\nwhat you're saying is, give me real time\nmonitoring but don't interrupt my game.\n\n212\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.170\nAnd when you turn that on you're not gonna\nbe aware of pop-ups, because you're gonna,\n\n213\n00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.880\nhey I'm in my game, I'm in the zone\nI don't want that to pop-up and\n\n214\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.700\nI don't want it to make me miss\na head shot or something right?\n\n215\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.000\n>> [LAUGH] I will tell you that\nI've used Avast before and\n\n216\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.570\nI had their free version and\nit does do some notifications for you.\n\n217\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.310\nAnd one night I was using my computer\nlate at night all by myself.\n\n218\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.240\nLights are out, I'm doing a little\ngaming and all of a sudden,\n\n219\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.110\nI had my speakers turned\nup maybe a little bit high.\n\n220\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.710\nAnd all of a sudden I hear this voice\n\"Avast has updated its antivirus\n\n221\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.910\ndefinitions.\" It's scared the living\nout of me, it really did.\n\n222\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.220\nThe first thing I do is go in there and\nlook for\n\n223\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.002\nthose notifications and turn them off.\n\n224\n00:10:50.002 --> 00:10:51.627\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n>> Maybe something you wanna do.\n\n225\n00:10:51.627 --> 00:10:53.300\n[LAUGH].\n>> Not a part of your game, but, boy,\n\n226\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.720\nI tell you what,\nit can definitely interrupt, yeah.\n\n227\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.145\nSo you know what the general\nsettings are pretty easy to set up.\n\n228\n00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:00.965\nIt's not too complicated.\n\n229\n00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:03.735\nOne of the things that\nyou might wanna look for\n\n230\n00:11:03.735 --> 00:11:07.695\ntoo is what can we do with like scans and\nstuff.\n\n231\n00:11:07.695 --> 00:11:08.985\nSo I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n232\n00:11:08.985 --> 00:11:12.485\nshow you a little bit about the scanning\nprocess and how that gets set up.\n\n233\n00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:17.120\nNow notice as we've talked about\nin other pieces of software\n\n234\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.920\nhere sometimes everybody names this\njust a little bit different right?\n\n235\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.070\nWell when we look at a smart skin,\nwhat is a smart skin?\n\n236\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.000\nWell it's kind of cryptic in\nnature no pun intended since we're\n\n237\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.250\ntalking about security class software but\nthe smart skin is actually a full skin and\n\n238\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.342\nI'll go ahead and just click this here.\n\n239\n00:11:34.342 --> 00:11:39.060\nAnd the we'll kind of let it run here\nas we're explaining notice that it says\n\n240\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.320\ncompatibility check here right, viruses,\noutdated software we'll talk about this.\n\n241\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.904\nBad reputation browser add-ons right,\nmalicious hijack's,\n\n242\n00:11:46.904 --> 00:11:48.890\nthose malicious add-on, right.\n\n243\n00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.960\nWe talk about things like\nActiveX controls, JAVA, JAVA for\n\n244\n00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.840\nthe most part is sandboxed, but\nthings like ActiveX are not sandboxed.\n\n245\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.840\nIn fact they, one of the reasons you\nneed to be an administrative level\n\n246\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.140\nuser to even install ActiveX.\n\n247\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.220\nNow they do have per user ActiveX controls\nwhich makes it a little bit more safe.\n\n248\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.930\nIt's because they can run in kernel mode.\n\n249\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:06.650\nAll right?\nAnd anything\n\n250\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.500\nthat's got access to the kernel has\naccess potentially down to those low\n\n251\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.120\nlevel system drivers when\nwe have stuff like that.\n\n252\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.170\nThat's where root kits come in so\nwe have to be careful with that.\n\n253\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.024\nNetwork based this has got a cool\nIPS intrusion prevention system or\n\n254\n00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:21.060\ntwo intrusion protection system.\n\n255\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.845\nAgain it's gonna do look for\nlike worms if you will.\n\n256\n00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:29.690\nProtocol people manipulating things\nlike protocols and stuff like that so\n\n257\n00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.530\nthat's really cool.\n\n258\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.240\nPerformance issues I really like this\none too when you talk about a full skin\n\n259\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.180\nthey're not kidding well they're saying\nhey we're gonna look at some things that\n\n260\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.970\nmight help you too.\n\n261\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.890\nAnd you know what if I, oh, it did okay.\n\n262\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.351\nSo it found some performance issues,\nall right?\n\n263\n00:12:42.351 --> 00:12:45.100\n[LAUGH] Apparently my computer's\ngot some performance issues.\n\n264\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.110\nAnd one of the things they do,\nmore specifically, are like temp files,\n\n265\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.110\nlog files,\nif you got temporary internet files.\n\n266\n00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.500\nThe windows operating system itself has\na temp folder in it, right, and there's\n\n267\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.620\nvariables that say store the temporary\nfiles here and it's not a bad thing but\n\n268\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.780\nas they start to generate a lot of log\nfiles, a lot of temporary files that\n\n269\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.020\nare just unnecessary, it can hinder\nperformance, but we really don't want to\n\n270\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.530\ngo too much into that because we're\nkinda getting off topic here.\n\n271\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:14.050\nSo, smart scan, it really is\nnothing more than a full scan.\n\n272\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.970\nNow if we look at some of\nthese other ones here,\n\n273\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.880\nyou'll see that you can\ndo these individually.\n\n274\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.880\nThese are all the ones that we really just\ntalked about, right, outdated software,\n\n275\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.085\nwhich I think is kinda cool.\n\n276\n00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:25.512\nCause if you think about it,\nwhat happens, right?\n\n277\n00:13:25.512 --> 00:13:29.160\nAs vendors all software vendors, right,\nthey make updates to their platforms,\n\n278\n00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.210\nsomebody finds a security vulnerability,\n\n279\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.040\nthe good vendors are really studious\nabout closing those off, but\n\n280\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.530\nif you're running the old software\nthose flaws, if you will, or\n\n281\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.020\nthose open doorways, part of that attack\nsurface might never have been patched up.\n\n282\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.040\nSo this is a good way you\ncan be aware of that.\n\n283\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.960\nOne of the ones I really wanna focus\non that we didn't see is the scan for\n\n284\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.540\nviruses.\n\n285\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.590\nWhen we look at scan for viruses,\nthis is a custom scan and\n\n286\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.690\nit doesn't just come right out and\nsay custom scan.\n\n287\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.470\nIt just says scan for viruses.\n\n288\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.140\nWell I would hope that a full scan\nwould scan for viruses as well.\n\n289\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.650\nSo and just kind of picking on,\njoking around here.\n\n290\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.090\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo the scan for viruses.\n\n291\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.750\nNow.\n\n292\n00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.410\nWhen you do the scans for viruses,\n\n293\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.030\nthis is where you get the options\nto kinda tell it what you want.\n\n294\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.720\nNow it's a little bit more specific.\n\n295\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.690\nYou can see what is going on, right.\n\n296\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.430\nSmart scan is gonna do\na full system scan and\n\n297\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.180\nit's going to do a lot of other things.\n\n298\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.840\nRemovable media.\n\n299\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.370\nWhy might I want to do removable media?\n\n300\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.100\nRight.\nWell if I let Mike borrow my hard\n\n301\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.290\ndrive and he goes and plugs it in to\nhis system, all right, or he goes and\n\n302\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.130\nplugs it in to the network\nwell when I get it back,\n\n303\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.730\nbefore I plug it into any one of my\nmachines, you bet I'm gonna scan it.\n\n304\n00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.570\nSorry Mike.\n\n305\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.741\n>> You don't trust me?\n\n306\n00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:42.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So we have to make sure.\n\n307\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.226\nAnd that might be something\nthat you wanna do.\n\n308\n00:14:43.226 --> 00:14:46.230\nYou might wanna, before.\n\n309\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.670\nI've always thought this is kinda funny.\n\n310\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.380\nRemovable media.\n\n311\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.060\nLet me scan the removable media.\n\n312\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.915\nWell what's the first thing I have\nto do to scan the removable media?\n\n313\n00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:54.650\n>> [LAUGH] Plug it in.\n\n314\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.450\n>> I gotta plug it in.\n\n315\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.460\nSo be careful with that one guys.\n\n316\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.120\nBut here's another one.\n\n317\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.970\nSelect a folder to scan is where\nwe're gonna do that coming up.\n\n318\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.965\nWe'll show you how to on that one.\n\n319\n00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:07.730\nBoot-time scan,\nwe've been talking about early protection.\n\n320\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.650\nRight?\n\n321\n00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.790\nBoot loaders.\n\n322\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.016\nThere's other technologies out there\nlike the firmware platforms, UEFI.\n\n323\n00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:16.684\nSome of the systems,\noperating systems themselves,\n\n324\n00:15:16.684 --> 00:15:18.660\ndo a good job at protecting themselves.\n\n325\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.470\nBut sometimes they need\na little bit more help.\n\n326\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.670\nAnd that's one of things it can do.\n\n327\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.140\nCheck that master boot record, check that\nGPT, where those boot files are stored and\n\n328\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.710\nthose boot sectors and make sure that\nthey have maintained their integrity and\n\n329\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.820\nthat they don't for instance,\nhave any extra software in there.\n\n330\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.891\nCould be very and I'm not sure honestly\nin the background what they're doing.\n\n331\n00:15:35.891 --> 00:15:37.670\nIt could be a checksum, right.\n\n332\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.220\nA lot of the known status of\nthe bootloaders that are authorized\n\n333\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:42.980\nbootloaders, right?\n\n334\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.980\nI think Grub and NTLDR for\nsome older operating systems.\n\n335\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.370\nBoot dot MGR for\nthe newer Windows based operating systems.\n\n336\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.838\nThere known, right?\n\n337\n00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:54.505\nMicrosoft takes a hash value of them and\nthey store that so\n\n338\n00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:58.229\nyou know what it's like so if you do have\nsoftware it can compare those values and\n\n339\n00:15:58.229 --> 00:16:02.177\nif those values are mismatched like we've\ntalked about in the first episodes it says\n\n340\n00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:04.850\nhey, somethings wrong,\nsomethings been modified.\n\n341\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.568\nSo it will flag it and\nit will hopefully remedy the situation.\n\n342\n00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:11.321\nSo for the most part, Mike, like I said,\n\n343\n00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:14.620\nit's not too difficult\nto set up a scan here.\n\n344\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.490\nJust have to kinda get through some\nof the verbiage that's specific to\n\n345\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.290\nthe vendor itself.\n\n346\n00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.840\nRemember smart scan,\n\n347\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.180\nit's gonna do all these scans with\nthe exception of the customized scan.\n\n348\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.980\nI scan for\nviruses like I said fairly easy there.\n\n349\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.320\nThat's your customized scan.\n\n350\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.360\nYou can get a little bit more specific.\n\n351\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.920\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n352\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.040\nYou know.\nIt's just another example of a consumer\n\n353\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.470\nlevel product that we can buy that's\ngonna help keep our system safe from that\n\n354\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.700\nmalware that's inevitably\ngonna get on there.\n\n355\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.960\n>> Indefinitely and there's a couple\nof other things that we can do too.\n\n356\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.910\nAnd I kinda forgot this one.\n\n357\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.130\nI definitely don't wanna,\nI should have added it in there.\n\n358\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.310\nHow about exclusions, right?\n\n359\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.550\nWe've been mentioning that there are times\nwhen you have certain folders, or\n\n360\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.120\nyou know, files.\n\n361\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.270\nOr folder and files for\nthat matter, on your computer and\n\n362\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.840\nyou want the ability to make sure that\nthe software doesn't happen to find these.\n\n363\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.160\nAnd then turn around and\nquarantine them, remove them, and\n\n364\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.580\nthen unfortunately they're gone.\n\n365\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.300\nSo this is another thing that can\nbe done through the settings.\n\n366\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.310\nIf you go to the little gear icon,\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n367\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.120\nyou can see that we have\na general level of options.\n\n368\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.610\nLet's see I believe it's\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n369\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.440\nYeah there we go.\n\n370\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.751\nIn fact let me go and show you some more\nof these settings that are here because\n\n371\n00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:22.110\nthey do pertain to your scans.\n\n372\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.530\nYou've got exclusions,\nwe'll get into smart scans and\n\n373\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.010\nspecial scans here in a second.\n\n374\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.790\nThat smart scan, I can tell smart\nscan exactly what I want it to do.\n\n375\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.130\nSo it's not going through all those.\n\n376\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.770\nOr maybe it's going through all\nthem if that's what I want.\n\n377\n00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.900\nSo, exclusions remember we talked about\nthe files and folders here web exclusions\n\n378\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.200\nthat's content filtering, URL filtering\nis sometimes they also call it.\n\n379\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.070\nCould be a key word too, but\nthis is more specific to maybe URLs.\n\n380\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:51.430\nYou don't wanna be blocked here and\nthen deep screen option too.\n\n381\n00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:57.000\nI don't want these files to be really,\nreally heavily scrutinized.\n\n382\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.270\nI want you to just kinda put\nthe blinders on, go past them.\n\n383\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.460\nYou can set that up as well.\n\n384\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.100\nWe'll get back to status monitoring\nhere in a second cuz I really wanna\n\n385\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.360\nstick with some of these virus scans.\n\n386\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.900\nHere's all the settings and\nnotice that I do have the ability,\n\n387\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.210\nbasically are slider bars here guys,\nturn them on, turn them off.\n\n388\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.500\nIf I don't wanna scan for outdated\nsoftware, maybe I've got the latest and\n\n389\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.560\ngreatest of everything,\n\n390\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.290\nI don't really care about any legacy\nsoftware, I might wanna turn this off.\n\n391\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.110\nIf you're supporting some of those older\nmachines that maybe they've gone past\n\n392\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.260\ntheir lifecycle.\n\n393\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.170\nI'm sure we've still got plenty of XP\nmachines out there that are no longer\n\n394\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.780\nsupport as fires of the security\nplatforms and updates and\n\n395\n00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:41.350\nstuff like that from Windows and\nthey let us know it was coming.\n\n396\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.900\nBut those systems are still probably,\n\n397\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.260\nthere's still many of them out there on\nthe network so you might say in that case\n\n398\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.830\nthat I better leave these on\nif I have some older machines.\n\n399\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.930\nMaybe you wanna turn it off.\n\n400\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.480\nI really, honestly, maybe the performance\nissues you might wanna turn off.\n\n401\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.170\nI really I would leave this alone so\nyou're aware.\n\n402\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.990\nRemember if it doesn't scan it then you're\nnot aware that there could be a problem\n\n403\n00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.170\nand then in and\nof itself could be a problem too.\n\n404\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.020\nNow we can also for instance we can.\n\n405\n00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.270\nYou know with a special scan there's\nnot really too much here that's\n\n406\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.170\nthat special like explorer scan and\nscreen saver.\n\n407\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.540\nLet's go over the settings here and\nkinda show you this.\n\n408\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.639\nYou can set scan parameters, right.\n\n409\n00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:24.710\nYou can get very,\nvery granular with what you set.\n\n410\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.820\nFor instance scanning, and\nagain what areas do you wanna scan, but\n\n411\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.700\nwhat I really like,\nlook at this with heuristics.\n\n412\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.510\nSensitivity right, if I reduce this,\nif I reduce the sensitivity,\n\n413\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.110\nwell let's keep it with the defaults,\nall right?\n\n414\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.680\nWhat we're saying is that how\nclose do you wanna match, right?\n\n415\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.250\nWe've talked about heuristics being\nthe likelihood and the checks and\n\n416\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.400\nbalances that it weighs and string\nsearches all combine and that it does, but\n\n417\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.420\nit's searching for the what ifs.\n\n418\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.230\nHow close do you want\nthe what if to match?\n\n419\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.365\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n420\n00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:59.960\nThat means that you're saying that if I\nsay the high sensitivity, I'm increasing\n\n421\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.140\nthe likelihood that maybe I\ndo a false positive, right?\n\n422\n00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.320\nBut the other side of that right, drawback\nto it, if we wanna save some CPU and\n\n423\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.830\ncomputational power we might reduce\nour security because we're saying\n\n424\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.890\nwe don't wanna get too specific here.\n\n425\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.100\nAnd that might be a false negative and\n\n426\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.630\nif you haven't seen, I'll tell you what\nlet's go ahead and mention again too.\n\n427\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.640\nSo if this is the first episode you'll\nbe aware of it, we've talked about false\n\n428\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.860\npositives, something that you wanted,\nbut it marked it as a virus.\n\n429\n00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.870\nIt quarantines it and\npotentially removes it.\n\n430\n00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.250\nThe false negative in my opinion,\nI don't know about you Mike,\n\n431\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.080\nis a little bit more deadly and\ndangerous to your networks.\n\n432\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.860\nIt's something that is malicious,\n\n433\n00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.050\nthat is something that can\nbring down your network.\n\n434\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.470\nAnd unfortunately, it flags it.\n\n435\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.950\nIt says,\nnope that's okay everything is good.\n\n436\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.610\nAnd unfortunately now,\nyou've got like a worm or\n\n437\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.720\nsomething traversing your network,\nI don't know.\n\n438\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.760\nWhat would you say on that one?\n\n439\n00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.010\n>> Yeah, I would rather be notified\nof stuff that I have to go back and\n\n440\n00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:00.390\nsay no, that's allowed than\nto have things get missed and\n\n441\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.441\nfind out too late that I've got something.\n\n442\n00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.762\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n443\n00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:08.442\nSo and again, so you could set up some\nof the individual rules here and again,\n\n444\n00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:09.697\nreporting as well.\n\n445\n00:21:09.697 --> 00:21:11.700\nSo like I said, fairly easy.\n\n446\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.390\nI do wanna mention the active protection.\n\n447\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.590\nThis is kinda something that\nyou should be aware of, too.\n\n448\n00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.710\nIt does active protection\non these locations and\n\n449\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.550\nyou can see some of the extra things it\ndoes like antispam and firewall, as well.\n\n450\n00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.600\nIf you decide to use the firewall you\nhave to be careful it will require\n\n451\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.990\na restart on that.\n\n452\n00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.576\nOne of the things I might mention to is,\nagain, is updates.\n\n453\n00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:40.110\nAll right, this update shows you\nthe current version of the database,\n\n454\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.180\nthe release date of the datable and the\nlast time that it reached outbound, and\n\n455\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.960\nit said,\nhey do I have the latest definitions?\n\n456\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.180\nAnd you can update that.\n\n457\n00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.560\nOne of the great things, too, is that\nmaybe you're on a metered bandwidth.\n\n458\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.380\nYou don't wanna do all\nof these at one time.\n\n459\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.940\nYou can also do a program update and\n\n460\n00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.220\nkeep the current version that you have and\nthe release date.\n\n461\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.330\nSo you can be aware of that,\n\n462\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:04.240\ncuz remember the software itself sometimes\nneeds to be updated and we know it does.\n\n463\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.900\nWe can also set the details.\n\n464\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.040\nAnd this is again metering connection, or\n\n465\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.280\neven more so, the days of dialup,\nmaybe you've got a really slow connection.\n\n466\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.400\nAnd then I would say last thing is if\nyou're pointing to if you're in a heavily\n\n467\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.270\nmanaged environment,\nyou might have a proxy.\n\n468\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.770\nYou might not be letting your users\ngo under their own prerogative,\n\n469\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.820\ngoing out to the Internet.\n\n470\n00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.200\nNow what do you say Mike, I tell you what,\n\n471\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.700\nwhat do you say that we put\nthis one through the test here?\n\n472\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.260\n>> Oh let's do it.\n\n473\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.369\n>> All right so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n474\n00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:36.315\nwe're gonna see how well avast is in\nits real time protection here and\n\n475\n00:22:36.315 --> 00:22:40.390\nwhat I'm gonna do here guys,\nis we're gonna bring over.\n\n476\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.540\n>> We're bring over a virus here and\nsee how it does.\n\n477\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.930\n>> I love to see these things work\nespecially when it's not my machine.\n\n478\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.460\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n479\n00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.160\nThere we go, Mike.\n\n480\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.185\nIt's like, you do it all you want sir.\n\n481\n00:22:50.185 --> 00:22:55.650\n[LAUGH] So and\nthis one we're not using the file string,\n\n482\n00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.830\ntest file that we've\nbeen using in the past.\n\n483\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.540\nSo this one was actually gonna\nbe a box of goodies here.\n\n484\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.170\nSo hopefully it does its job.\n\n485\n00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.380\nAnd it did right there\nwe can catch it here.\n\n486\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.390\nAnd notice it gives you the option\nto report it as a false positive.\n\n487\n00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.080\nSo what if this was,\nagain, like some security.\n\n488\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.000\nMike was doing some security research and\n\n489\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.410\nnow he's got a virus on his computer\nthat is quarantined already.\n\n490\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.040\nIt's in a protected location\nbecause he's doing research right.\n\n491\n00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.620\nWell, we might not want\nthat to be deleted,\n\n492\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.420\nit might do exactly what this one's doing,\n\n493\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:33.010\nwhich this is a test research based virus\nand it might quarantine and remove that.\n\n494\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.250\nAnd unfortunately,\nhe can't do the research for the day.\n\n495\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.500\nSo you do have that option.\n\n496\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.900\nSo let's see what it did though.\n\n497\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.722\nWe'll get back into our\nTools > Statistics.\n\n498\n00:23:44.722 --> 00:23:46.740\nThat's settings I believe here.\n\n499\n00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.060\nActive protection.\n\n500\n00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.080\nWell it looks, it's not there.\n\n501\n00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.390\nWhere are.\n\n502\n00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.330\n>> You love the way,\n\n503\n00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.620\nof course every single program you\ngotta learn where they put their stuff.\n\n504\n00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.010\nWhere do I go to start the scan?\n\n505\n00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.000\nWhere do I go to see my quarantine?\n\n506\n00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.830\nSometimes they call it your history,\nsometimes they call it quarantine,\n\n507\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.760\nsome of them make it real easy to find,\nothers.\n\n508\n00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.410\n>> Yeah.\n\n509\n00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:08.910\n>> Not so much.\n\n510\n00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:14.830\n>> Yeah this one is just asking me if\nI wanna update my subscription here.\n\n511\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.652\nSo down here at the bottom\nis our scan history.\n\n512\n00:24:17.652 --> 00:24:21.320\nAll right, well one of the things to\nkeep in mind is that this wasn't a scan,\n\n513\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.970\nthis was a quarantine.\n\n514\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:30.010\nSo if I go into scan history,\nnotice it's gonna say well no virus found.\n\n515\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.760\nAll right now you guys see and\nthen it did find a virus and\n\n516\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.620\nit took care of it for us.\n\n517\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.560\nSo what is that for us?\n\n518\n00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.755\nWell, that's something in\na vast called a virus chest.\n\n519\n00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:43.655\nAnd it's the quarantine location.\n\n520\n00:24:43.655 --> 00:24:47.395\nSo it's not gonna remove it\nuntil we tell it to, all right?\n\n521\n00:24:47.395 --> 00:24:48.665\nSo you can see that it found it.\n\n522\n00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:50.739\nAnd you know what,\nthis one might have, oh, a default.\n\n523\n00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.260\nThank goodness it's taking care of it.\n\n524\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.760\nDefault action, severity level high or\nseverity level five, you find it,\n\n525\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.620\nyou quarantine.\n\n526\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.860\nDon't wait for me to say anything.\n\n527\n00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.270\nTake care of my computer and clean it.\n\n528\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.290\nSo I mean, kudos.\n\n529\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.500\nIt definitely did its job there.\n\n530\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.670\nSo and again, looks like they did\nwhat they said they were gonna do,\n\n531\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.110\nthey're given you real time protection\non here, it caught it right away.\n\n532\n00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.370\nAnd because of the default action that\nsecurity level is high on that one,\n\n533\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.050\nit's set up, we're gonna take care of this\nfor you and we're not even gonna wait for\n\n534\n00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:20.570\nyou to ask.\n\n535\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.960\nWe'll quarantine it and\nwe'll go ahead and remove it.\n\n536\n00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.740\nNow I could change that setting, right?\n\n537\n00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.480\nI could say, now just quarantine it and\nthen leave it.\n\n538\n00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.520\nBut if you set it and forget it,\nyou could be quarantining a virus for\n\n539\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.150\na long time and\nyou certainly don't wanna leave that.\n\n540\n00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.310\nIf it's quarantined,\nyou wanna get rid of it.\n\n541\n00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.790\nIf it's a false positive, you wanna at\nleast check it then you can restore it and\n\n542\n00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.580\nthen the next time it runs,\nyou might even mark an exclusion on it,\n\n543\n00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.690\nyou won't have to worry about that.\n\n544\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.500\nSo again, avast seems like it's\ndone its job for us, Mike.\n\n545\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.760\n>> It really has, Wes,\na lot of great information there.\n\n546\n00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.280\nJust another great product that we\ncan get to keep our systems safe,\n\n547\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.858\nthere's lots of bad malware out there.\n\n548\n00:25:54.858 --> 00:25:58.490\nAnd we've gotta keep it off of our\ndevices whether we're at home or\n\n549\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.750\nin that so ho and we can't afford\nthat big enterprise level software.\n\n550\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.750\nWe're not left out in the dark.\n\n551\n00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.120\nWe've got things like avast\nthat can keep us safe.\n\n552\n00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.310\nAnd they have most of the bells and\n\n553\n00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.240\nwhistles that you're gonna find in\nthose enterprise class products.\n\n554\n00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.340\nSo good job Wes, thank you for\nall those great demonstrations.\n\n555\n00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.900\nThat is gonna do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n556\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.930\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n557\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.700\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n558\n00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.972\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n559\n00:26:24.972 --> 00:26:26.620\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.725\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.800\ntoday we're going to be diving into\nthe world of anti-virus and anti-malware.\n\n5\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.510\nAnd specifically we're gonna be looking\nat a program called AVG Protection.\n\n6\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.720\nThis is what we would call one of our\nconsumer-grade anti-virus products, and\n\n7\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150\nwe've looked a couple already.\n\n8\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.510\nThere's just one more in the lineup.\n\n9\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.210\nAnd here to help us with that\nis gonna be Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.080\nHow are you doing, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.160\n>> I'm doing great, Mike,\nthanks for having me back here.\n\n12\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.997\nAlways a pleasure to be here,\nand just like Mike said,\n\n13\n00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:46.401\nlet's move on into our\nconsumer-grade anti-virus software.\n\n14\n00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.060\nAnd I'll tell you what Mike,\nlike we've been doing it, let's go and\n\n15\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.200\nstick to the routine.\n\n16\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.830\nWe'll dive right in, and\nwe'll show you how to install AVG.\n\n17\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.500\nFor the most part guys, I've already gone\nahead and I've downloaded the software.\n\n18\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.410\nKeep in mind depending on what\nanti-virus software you're using,\n\n19\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.400\nyou might have to connect to the website.\n\n20\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.890\nDo a registration before you can download\nit, sometimes it's a standalone download.\n\n21\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.050\nThis one right here I'm\npretty sure it's just AVG,\n\n22\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.070\nyou guys have probably seen it out\nthere free, very good protection here.\n\n23\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640\nBut I'll tell you, just kind of\nkeeping with the consistency here,\n\n24\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.740\neven though they have\nan excellent free version,\n\n25\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.430\nwe're actually gonna do\nthe subscription-based version.\n\n26\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.920\nNow you might say,\nwell Wes, wait a second.\n\n27\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.600\nWhich installer do I need?\n\n28\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810\nWell, you need the same one.\n\n29\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.020\nSo that's one of the great things.\n\n30\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140\nOne installer, and you can pick.\n\n31\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.290\nThey don't force you.\n\n32\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.880\nWell, we'll go ahead, and I'll tell\nyou what, and we'll show you that.\n\n33\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.260\nSo one installer.\n\n34\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.120\nIt gives you the choice,\ndo you want to use the free version, and\n\n35\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.920\nthere's nothing wrong\nwith the free version.\n\n36\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.520\nI've used it before as well.\n\n37\n00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.876\nAnd do you want to use the trial version?\n\n38\n00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:50.028\nAnd it's going to go ahead and\nconnect outbound,\n\n39\n00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:53.940\nit's gonna bring down\nthe installation files that it needs.\n\n40\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.810\nAnd it just starts walk-through\nbasic installation here.\n\n41\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.550\nAgain, pretty easy breezy.\n\n42\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.900\nNow I do want to make mention\nof a couple of things here.\n\n43\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.560\nYou do have this custom installation\nbutton down here and your language,\n\n44\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.740\nwhatever language is local to your region.\n\n45\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.990\nHere I'm in the States, so\nmy language is English here.\n\n46\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.196\nIf you're out there, and\nyou're in other locations guys,\n\n47\n00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:16.410\njust make sure that you get the language\nthat's native to whatever you speak.\n\n48\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.190\nWant you to look at the custom\ninstallation here too.\n\n49\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.520\nAnd this is where you get the choice,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.571\nYou don't have to go\nwith the free version.\n\n51\n00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.590\nIf you want to, you can.\n\n52\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.230\nIf you're a college kid out there and\nyou're on a strict budget.\n\n53\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.730\nIt might be something for you.\n\n54\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.230\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nshow you the full protection here.\n\n55\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.750\nI've already got a trial\nmembership started, and\n\n56\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.500\nnow, when it goes to the components\nthat you want to install\n\n57\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.650\nyou can figure out which\nones that you want.\n\n58\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.625\nYou can uncheck these.\n\n59\n00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:47.170\nI'm going to go ahead, and we'll just\nleave all the bells and whistles.\n\n60\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.390\nAnd we'll really take this for\na test drive.\n\n61\n00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.900\nThis is the user account control,\nguys that's popping up,\n\n62\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.720\nit can show you that you need\nto run this as an administrator.\n\n63\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.792\nWith most software installations,\nstandard users can run most software,\n\n64\n00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:05.100\nall right, but they can't run things\nlike security grade software and\n\n65\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.295\nthey certainly can't install software.\n\n66\n00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:09.811\nSo, if you're not an administrator and\nyou get that UAC and\n\n67\n00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:11.773\nit's got a little user name and\ndialogue box,\n\n68\n00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:15.980\nthat's the first tell-tale sign that\nyou're installing it as a standard user.\n\n69\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.320\nAnd if you've got a computer that maybe\nsomebody else owns or maybe, I don't know,\n\n70\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.330\nit's part of a school and\nyou're not allowed to run as\n\n71\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.860\nadministrator, if you wanna test this out,\nthen you're gonna have to take it to\n\n72\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.350\nsomebody that does have those\nadministrative credentials.\n\n73\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.540\nA couple of different things that\nyou can do when you go to connect.\n\n74\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.000\nAnd let me go ahead, and\n\n75\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.210\nwhile this is talk a little bit about\nyour options here down on the side.\n\n76\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.850\nI've already created an account ahead of\ntime so that we didn't have to wait for\n\n77\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.030\nit to go through that process,\n\n78\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.120\nbut it is good to know that if you don't\nhave an account, you can do it right here.\n\n79\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.660\nYou can enter your email address,\nyou can enter your password,\n\n80\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.270\nif you need to read the privacy policy,\nyou can do that.\n\n81\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.490\nBut you can also skip it as well, and\n\n82\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.570\nyou could see down there,\nif I need to skip it, I can.\n\n83\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.870\nSo if you haven't created\naccount that's the way to go.\n\n84\n00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.621\nNow the other thing you can do is\nyou can log in to your own account,\n\n85\n00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:10.475\nif you've already created one,\nwhich is what we're gonna do, and\n\n86\n00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.951\nthen they also give you this\noption of an invitation code.\n\n87\n00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:18.502\nSo let me go ahead and switch this, and\nwhile it's downloading in the background,\n\n88\n00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:24.170\nI'll go ahead and enter my email address\nout here and my super secret password.\n\n89\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.430\nHopefully you guys-\n>> One, two, three, four.\n\n90\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.533\n>> You do.\nActually I got\n\n91\n00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.562\nthis password from your machine, Mike.\n\n92\n00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:32.284\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've seen you type it in.\n\n93\n00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:33.038\nIt was dot dot dot dot dot.\n\n94\n00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:34.559\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n95\n00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:35.294\n[LAUGH] One of my favorites.\n\n96\n00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:37.222\n>> Yeah,\nI mean that looks all right, right?\n\n97\n00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:38.871\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n>> Dot dot dot dot dot dot [LAUGH].\n\n98\n00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.804\nSo oh,\nthe other thing I might tell you too,\n\n99\n00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:44.960\nremember to make sure this is checked.\n\n100\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.355\nLog in as an admin.\n\n101\n00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:49.830\nYou got to be an admin to install this,\nbut if you're logging into your account,\n\n102\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.840\nyou wanna make sure that you're an admin,\nbecause remember what this does.\n\n103\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.431\nIt modifies key security settings, right?\n\n104\n00:04:55.431 --> 00:05:01.279\nIt can potentially make changes\nto the firewall configuration,\n\n105\n00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.520\nso be careful with that.\n\n106\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.381\nNow, I was gonna say, go ahead Mike, yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.038\n>> Yeah, any time you're using software\nthat could make changes to other than your\n\n108\n00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:09.970\nown stuff, right?\n\n109\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.160\nIf you're sticking in your profile, that's\nfine, but anytime you're going to go\n\n110\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.735\noutside that, modify something on\nthe system itself, or something that,\n\n111\n00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:21.195\ncuz this could quarantine somebody if\nthere is more than one profile on there.\n\n112\n00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:24.620\nWhat if you scan one of their profiles and\nfound something in quarantine,\n\n113\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.560\nright, so that's where you have to\nhave those administrative rights.\n\n114\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.390\n>> Most definitely,\nthat's a good point too.\n\n115\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.917\nOne of the things that you can see here,\nwhile this is going through its\n\n116\n00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:39.750\ninstallation process,\nis it doesn't only work on your computer.\n\n117\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.430\nYou can install this on other\ncomputers within your home network and\n\n118\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.390\nyou can control their profile, or\ntheir anti-virus scan here if you need to.\n\n119\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.320\nSo, for instance, if I've got another\nmachine, maybe I wanna switch over.\n\n120\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.300\nNow, you can see this is\nstill installing here.\n\n121\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.470\nBut if I switch over to my laptop, right?\n\n122\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.090\nIt's already installed on my laptop.\n\n123\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.750\nSo I can see it's letting me know,\nguess what?\n\n124\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.040\nThis is protected.\n\n125\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.060\nBut at the same time, how protected is it?\n\n126\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.060\nWell, notice it's been ten days\nsince I've synchronized this device.\n\n127\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.870\nSo, while it does give you the ability\nto see if you're protected,\n\n128\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.510\nyou also have to make sure that\nthose other devices are connected\n\n129\n00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.110\nin order to get the full advantage.\n\n130\n00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.365\nNow, it's a fairly fast install.\n\n131\n00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:25.876\nNow, okay, and it says it's been\nconnected to the network and\n\n132\n00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.211\nwe can say okay to that.\n\n133\n00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:30.430\nNow, I do wanna stop on this for a second,\ncuz you're gonna notice something.\n\n134\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.694\nNow this is a component\na little bit different,\n\n135\n00:06:32.694 --> 00:06:35.760\nthan the AVG software\nthat we're looking at.\n\n136\n00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.160\nThis is the action center\ninside of Windows.\n\n137\n00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.771\nThis is one of those things,\nlike Mike was saying,\n\n138\n00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:44.371\nyou're going to work outside of\nthe boundaries of your user profile.\n\n139\n00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:48.090\nThis thing is going to\ndisable your firewall, right?\n\n140\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.860\nWell, you say, well, wait a second Wes,\nthat's not a good thing.\n\n141\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.630\nWe don't want our firewall disabled.\n\n142\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.670\nWell, it's gotta disable one firewall,\nso its firewall can take over.\n\n143\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.910\nBut it's not intrusive.\n\n144\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.160\nOne of the things I like about this is if\nit does flag that, and you can see here,\n\n145\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.730\nit's telling you right now, as it's going\nthrough the process of scanning and\n\n146\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.810\nchecking, that you are not\nfully protected, here.\n\n147\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.910\nLet me show you in action\ncenter real quick,\n\n148\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.130\nkinda give you guys what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n149\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.330\nIf I go into System and Secure.\n\n150\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.990\nOh, there it is.\n\n151\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.280\nIn fact, let me go ahead and click that\ncuz it's also updating, by the way.\n\n152\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.300\nSo a couple of things that are going\non dynamically here, we'll get back to\n\n153\n00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.160\nthe firewall but it's asking do you want\nto allow this program, right, to run?\n\n154\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.730\nDo you trust the publisher?\n\n155\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.020\nBecause now it's saying,\nit's doing two things here,\n\n156\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.430\nit's turning off your Windows firewall,\nit's turning off Windows Defender.\n\n157\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.820\nAll right, those are big deals, these\nare two things that keep this computer,\n\n158\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.550\nit's how Windows protects itself.\n\n159\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.095\nAnd Windows is warning you.\n\n160\n00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:47.670\nYou're about to make a decision that can\naffect the security of your computer so\n\n161\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.350\nyou better choose wisely.\n\n162\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.765\nBecause we're seeing some of this during\nthe installation of an anti-malware I'm\n\n163\n00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.953\nnot worried about it.\n\n164\n00:07:54.953 --> 00:07:56.994\nBut you do need to make that decision.\n\n165\n00:07:56.994 --> 00:08:01.142\nYes, I trust the publisher,\nas far as AVG goes.\n\n166\n00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:03.151\nSo, I'm gonna let it go ahead and\ndo its thing and\n\n167\n00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:05.357\nyou'll see right here\nthe Firewall isn't started.\n\n168\n00:08:05.357 --> 00:08:08.100\nWell, it's saying it requires a restart.\n\n169\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.900\nLet's see what Windows is reporting\nit as real quick here and\n\n170\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.290\nsee if it's telling me\nwrong location here.\n\n171\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.960\nHelp with the browse to the right\nside of the direction there, and\n\n172\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.900\nwe got the system in security and\nthen an action center.\n\n173\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.960\nAnd action center's all lit up, right?\n\n174\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.840\nNow, Windows update guys,\nI haven't turned on Windows update\n\n175\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.980\nI could probably change that setting but\nthis is the one that AVG just did for\n\n176\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.560\nus because the Window's firewall\nis turned on by default.\n\n177\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.240\nAny default installation of Windows\nsince going back to XP service pack two,\n\n178\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.500\nis going to have the firewall turned on.\n\n179\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.670\nNotice it says Windows firewall and\n\n180\n00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.720\nAVG Internet Security both report\nthat they're turned off Okay, right.\n\n181\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.790\nNow, here's that one that I didn't get to\nin time it will just pop up like you've\n\n182\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.440\nseen in the other one about\nthe other settings there,\n\n183\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.930\nI can turn on AVG fire wall and that's\nwhat I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n184\n00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.230\nit's gonna ask me again do\nyou trust this publisher?\n\n185\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.530\nRight, this is a big decision.\n\n186\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.080\nIt's something that\nshouldn't be taken lightly.\n\n187\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.440\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll say yes to that.\n\n188\n00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.310\nBut notice now I've turned\non the firewall, right?\n\n189\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.630\nBut I'm not protected.\n\n190\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.150\nSo, in order to get the firewall working,\n\n191\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.100\nwe're gonna have to do\nthe legendary reboot, right?\n\n192\n00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.188\nReboots fix everything.\n\n193\n00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.210\n>> [LAUGH] Of course.\n\n194\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.710\n>> So,\nthis isn't gonna be any different here.\n\n195\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.210\nAnd we'll hope that the reboot doesn't\ntake forever and a day on this one.\n\n196\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.920\nSo, kind of while we're waiting for\nthe reboot, keep this in mind.\n\n197\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.830\nYou know,\nwhen you make those decisions and\n\n198\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.160\nthose pop ups come up don't just say no.\n\n199\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.920\nDon't turn it off.\n\n200\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.100\nDon't think you don't got a virus.\n\n201\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.170\nYou have a decision to make whether you\nwant to use the Windows firewall or\n\n202\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.590\nwhether you want to use the ABG firewall.\n\n203\n00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.500\nAnd I know that we're talking\nabout antivirus, but when it\n\n204\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.700\ncomes to communications inbound through\nthe firewall, that's how you get viruses.\n\n205\n00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.680\nSo, again,\nthat's a pretty hefty deal there and\n\n206\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.720\nyou wanna make sure that\nyou make the right choice.\n\n207\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.870\n>> Can I use both?\n\n208\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.780\n>> No.\n[LAUGH] No.\n\n209\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:07.840\nYou can use both but as we know,\nthey do not play well together here.\n\n210\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.750\nAll right.\n\n211\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.800\n>> Yeah, the problem is gonna be,\n\n212\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.280\nif I've got two firewalls,\n>> I thought I could run them both.\n\n213\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.450\nBut if I make an exception in one, it's\nnot going open up the hole in the other\n\n214\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.600\none, so\nnow I've got to do everything twice.\n\n215\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.210\nIt's not going to be a good day.\n\n216\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.420\n>> Yeah.\nIt definitely isn't.\n\n217\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.460\nThey don't like to play nice\nwith each other like Mike said,\n\n218\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.440\none blocks the other and\nit just becomes a nightmare here.\n\n219\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.160\nSo, whatever choice you make\nYou gotta make a choice.\n\n220\n00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.660\nNow, it's also telling me about, and\n\n221\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.460\nthis is kind of cool because it's my\ntrial remaining days in here, and\n\n222\n00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.760\nit's letting me know, hey you want to buy\nsome additional information and I'll just\n\n223\n00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.390\nsay remind me later, again because\nI don't like to turn off reminders.\n\n224\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.040\nI would forget my head if it\nwasn't attached to my neck.\n\n225\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.460\n>> We've talked about notification, we've\ntalked about reminders, I don't mind, and\n\n226\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.500\nI know it's a little redundant,\n\n227\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.690\nI don't mind little reminders\nbecause it just helps me out.\n\n228\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.620\nIt's what it's there for.\n\n229\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.250\nI don't care about the intrusive\nnature even if I'm working.\n\n230\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.240\nAbout the only time I might care about\nit is if I'm in the middle of a game and\n\n231\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.490\nit causes me to lose my match.\n\n232\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.810\nThen I might not like the notification but\nlong as I'm secure I'm okay.\n\n233\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.270\nSo Mike,\nsome of the things that we got in here.\n\n234\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.580\nWe talked about,\nremember to create your account.\n\n235\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.470\nI've already logged in.\n\n236\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.410\nLet's go ahead, I tell you what, how about\nwe look at some of the scanning options\n\n237\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.820\nthat we have so\nyou guys can be aware of that here.\n\n238\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.410\nNow, every piece of software,\nwhen you go to scanning options,\n\n239\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.600\nit's gonna be a little bit different.\n\n240\n00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.990\nAnd you can see, for the most part,\n\n241\n00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.300\nit's got this tile interface and\nIt's not too difficult to understand.\n\n242\n00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.810\nThat doesn't just come out and say scan.\n\n243\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.810\nThat's where the Protection Pro comes in.\n\n244\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.430\nProtection Pro, when you click that,\n\n245\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.180\nit takes you to another interface\nthat allows you to do your scans.\n\n246\n00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.320\nNow, we get to the next interface and\nwell,\n\n247\n00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.830\nthere's a whole bunch of other tiles,\nright?\n\n248\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.850\nAnd you might think,\n\n249\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.220\nwell, nothing like having a door Opening\na door just to come to a locked door.\n\n250\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.720\nBut, joking around guys, joking aside,\nhere's your scan options.\n\n251\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.680\nNow, when you do your scan options,\nthis is another one that for the most\n\n252\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.570\npart they don't really name the These\ntoo cryptic, you can pretty much tell.\n\n253\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.020\nWe'll look at the Managing scheduled scans\ncuz I'd like to show you guys how you can\n\n254\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.430\nadd some specific\ncustomized scheduled scans.\n\n255\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.000\nSo, we'll look at that\none here in a second.\n\n256\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.420\nNow guys, this one right here,\n\n257\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.550\nScan my Whole Computer, that's what\nwe've commonly seen, it's a full scan.\n\n258\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.410\nSpecific Files and Folders,\njust think of that as custom scan.\n\n259\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.670\nAnd I'll show you some of\nthe settings coming up on that one.\n\n260\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.791\nAnd this is really cool,\nthey have a dedicated anti-rootkit scan.\n\n261\n00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.300\nNow, that being said,\nI'll show you some of the settings,\n\n262\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.320\nin each one of the scans they\ndo they also scan for rootkits.\n\n263\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.690\nSo, they're not just saying No anytime\nwe scan your computer unless you\n\n264\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.590\nclick this button we're not checking for\nrootkits.\n\n265\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.860\nThis one goes a little\nbit more in depth and\n\n266\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.620\nthe whole entire scan is\ndedicated to looking for\n\n267\n00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.500\njust the areas that rootkits reside so\nthey kind of prioritize that in that scan.\n\n268\n00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.760\nAnd the first two setting buttons\nthey take you to the same location so\n\n269\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.780\nlet me just show you that right quick.\n\n270\n00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.220\nIf i click on this one Right?\n\n271\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.540\nAnd so scan whole computer,\nand we look at the settings.\n\n272\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.460\nAnd then if I choose back,\nand I choose that, well,\n\n273\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.080\nit's the same location so the last one,\nguys, is a little bit different.\n\n274\n00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.440\nAnd we're gonna show you that coming up.\n\n275\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.640\nNow, in some of the things you can do,\nthey have your PUPs here as well,\n\n276\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:19.290\npotentially unwanted programs, guys just\nCryptographic for spyware, the trojans,\n\n277\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.700\nadware, grayware, the things that\nare annoying on your computer.\n\n278\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.210\nNow, you can scan for\ntracking cookies as well.\n\n279\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.630\nSo, it really looks at your privacy, too.\n\n280\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:34.250\nYou can scan for tracking cookies,\narchives, and here's heuristics base.\n\n281\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.380\nSo, you do have the heuristics\nbase that you can implement.\n\n282\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.200\nIf you want to go and do that.\n\n283\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.920\nNow you have some additional settings\nthe additional settings just\n\n284\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.090\nallow you do to like for instance files.\n\n285\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.910\nSo for instance I could say shut down\nthe computer after the scan finishes.\n\n286\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.410\nWhat file types.\n\n287\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.110\nAnd then I can define those and\nnotice defined excluded extensions so\n\n288\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.810\nmaybe I don't want You\nprobably wouldn't want this.\n\n289\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.100\nBut as an example, I don't want .txts\nbeing scoured through and looked through,\n\n290\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.210\nso you can just name the extension.\n\n291\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.180\n>> I like that one where it lets you shut\nit down, cuz a lot of times what I'll do,\n\n292\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.480\nis if I wanna do a manual scan\nwhen I'm done with my computer,\n\n293\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.350\nI'll start up that scan and\nif I'm doing a full scan,\n\n294\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.172\nit can take minutes to much longer\n>> I'm ready to go do something else or\n\n295\n00:14:19.172 --> 00:14:20.450\ntypically [LAUGH] go to bed, right?\n\n296\n00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.460\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n297\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.510\n>> I can just start that scan up and\nwalk away and\n\n298\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.340\nI know it's gonna finish the scan and\nthen power my machine down for the night.\n\n299\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.490\n>> Well yeah, exactly, and maybe something\nyou guys out there in IT know that we're\n\n300\n00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.860\nprobably working late at night so\nyeah, absolutely.\n\n301\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.030\nYou start this scan at 11 o'clock at night\nand you do one of these heuristic scans\n\n302\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.190\nthat could take, and a terabyte drive,\ntwo Two terabyte drive.\n\n303\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.080\nHow long are you going to be there?\n\n304\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.940\nAnd you certainly don't wanna wait,\nand maybe you don't want to\n\n305\n00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.340\nleave your computer on overnight and\ncome back in the morning.\n\n306\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.780\nSo, it's a good thing to have that.\n\n307\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.020\nSo again,\nyou can define exclusions as well.\n\n308\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.850\nNow, let me go ahead and take a second and\n\n309\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.180\nshow you,\nin fact there's also reporting here too.\n\n310\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.730\nSo, scan reports\n>> Just to show you guys\n\n311\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.250\nsome of these options here.\n\n312\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.610\nAgain, when you have reports,\nyou can modify how much\n\n313\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:12.310\nverbose information are in those reports,\nand I'm not going to modify anything here.\n\n314\n00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.980\nBut, it is good to see where\nyou can configure that.\n\n315\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.040\nNow, Just like any reports,\noop clicked a little bit too fast there.\n\n316\n00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.750\nJust like any reports guys keep in mind\nthat the more data you put in a report\n\n317\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.320\nthe more prone you might be to performance\ndegradation because log files generally\n\n318\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.200\ncan grow.\n\n319\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.900\nA lot of times though\ntoday they know that.\n\n320\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.950\nAnd they'll tell you overwrite\nafter a certain amount of time.\n\n321\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.380\nThe rootkit scan, now this takes us\nmore into some of our advanced settings.\n\n322\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.763\nAnd we get the options there to\nwhere we can set up things like for\n\n323\n00:15:43.763 --> 00:15:48.561\ninstance, maybe you do wanna update\nyour machines or Was right, and\n\n324\n00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:54.290\nif you update your viruses definition\ndatabase, you can do that from right here.\n\n325\n00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.595\nAll right, and you're gonna end up seeing\nthat we also have some options to do\n\n326\n00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:01.525\ncomputer restart Right,\npost update memory scan.\n\n327\n00:16:01.525 --> 00:16:03.499\nNow that's really cool, right.\n\n328\n00:16:03.499 --> 00:16:07.870\nAfter it's scanned, go back in memory and\nfind if anything's loaded itself back up.\n\n329\n00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.070\nAnd then additional updates\nthat you could run.\n\n330\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.400\nSo pretty easy on this.\n\n331\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.680\nProxies, guys, as we've talked about it,\nmaybe you're in a managed environment,\n\n332\n00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.890\nlike I said, you're probably,\nif you're in a managed environment,\n\n333\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.990\nyou'd be using Enterprise grade\nsoftware as well, but you never know,\n\n334\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.130\nyou might want to point\nthis stuff outbound.\n\n335\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.660\n>> Yeah absolutely, it's gotta be able\nto reach out and get its updates, so if\n\n336\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.360\nyou're in a network, and heck maybe you're\nrunning a proxy at home, or you're in that\n\n337\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.170\nSoho and if it can't get to the internet,\nwhich means it can't get it's updates.\n\n338\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.030\nWhich means it, it's kind of useless.\n\n339\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.230\nSo we got to give it those proxy settings.\n\n340\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.730\n>> Yeah.\n\n341\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.620\nLike we said in some\nof the other episodes,\n\n342\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.581\nnothing like protecting yourself\nfrom viruses that came out in 1991.\n\n343\n00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:47.048\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now temporary update files too.\n\n344\n00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.586\nYou know,\nmanage it's own databases as well.\n\n345\n00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:51.548\nAnd or, it'll make sure that there's,\n\n346\n00:16:51.548 --> 00:16:55.660\nit's not bogging down your computer with\nadditional information, likewise, too.\n\n347\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.930\nNow, some of the other things that you\ncan do is, we can see exceptions here.\n\n348\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:07.510\nThe virus vault, again,\nhow many virus' are we going to allow and\n\n349\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.330\nhow much consumption of the hard\ndrive are we going to allow here?\n\n350\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.620\nYou can also configure that.\n\n351\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.570\nAVG also has a self protection.\n\n352\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.810\nLike we've talked about,\nwe want to be able to\n\n353\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.850\nmake sure that the virus software\nitself can't be attacked and shut down.\n\n354\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.870\nWell, we can configure that likewise, too.\n\n355\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.620\nWe can come in here and\nwe can do the self protection module.\n\n356\n00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.670\nAnd it is enabled by default.\n\n357\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.820\nAnd again, one of the things that this\ndoes is it makes sure that, you know,\n\n358\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.520\nthe antivirus software a lot of\ntimes will come online before this\n\n359\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.070\nantivirus software kicks off.\n\n360\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.680\nOr the antivirus, or excuse me, the virus\nitself will come online very early in\n\n361\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.950\nthe boot process before the malware\neven gets a chance to do it job,\n\n362\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.250\nso this is AVG's way of protecting itself.\n\n363\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.660\n>> Remember, you know, a lot of the early\ndays in the antivirus programs.\n\n364\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.580\nI mean, that was one of the things\nthat the virus writers would do,\n\n365\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.980\nis they would, in their code,\nwrite ways to disable your antivirus.\n\n366\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.125\nAnd so, you did all this work to make\nsure you're running antivirus, and\n\n367\n00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:03.715\nthen they figured out how\nto disable it for you.\n\n368\n00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:06.775\nSo now they've figured out how to\narmor themselves against that.\n\n369\n00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:08.235\n>> Yeah,\nkind of like throwing a rock at a tank.\n\n370\n00:18:08.235 --> 00:18:10.192\nIt just doesn't make much sense.\n\n371\n00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:12.955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me go ahead and\n\n372\n00:18:12.955 --> 00:18:16.490\ntake time to show you how to\nmanage your scheduled scans, too.\n\n373\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.460\nWhen you manage scheduled scans,\n\n374\n00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.238\napparently I did a great job at managing\nthem because there are no scheduled scans.\n\n375\n00:18:22.238 --> 00:18:23.490\n>> [LAUGH] That's one way to manage them.\n\n376\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.670\n>> Yeah, that's one way to manage them.\n\n377\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.380\nWe don't have any.\n\n378\n00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.390\nRight out of sight, out of mind.\n\n379\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.000\nBut, we can add a scheduled scan, too.\n\n380\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.080\nWe can show you exactly how to do that.\n\n381\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.450\nAnd we can even look at\nsome of the settings.\n\n382\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.050\nYou know, maybe I want it to\nrun Monday through Friday.\n\n383\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.550\nMaybe I don't want it to run out\nhere on Saturday at all, or Sunday.\n\n384\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.150\nI'm not sure exactly why [LAUGH]\nyou might wanna do that.\n\n385\n00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, you know,\n\n386\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.190\nyou could set it\n>> And how often do you want it to run.\n\n387\n00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.430\nSo for\ninstance I can choose run every hour.\n\n388\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.600\nRight.\nAnd maybe I want to say, maybe run.\n\n389\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.570\nMaybe that's a little too CPU intensive.\n\n390\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.180\nMaybe I want to run it every three hours,\nand again that still could be quite a lot.\n\n391\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.560\nBut there again,\nif you're doing a lot of maybe browsing.\n\n392\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.520\nThat's part of what you do.\n\n393\n00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.330\nBrowsing the internet.\n\n394\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.680\nChecking blog posts.\n\n395\n00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680\nMaybe you do research.\n\n396\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.040\nMaybe you're a college\nstudent out there and\n\n397\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.510\nit requires connecting to\nwebsites to do studies and stuff.\n\n398\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.200\nSo this might be something\nyou want to set too.\n\n399\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.710\nIf you're on a laptop.\n\n400\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.030\nThis is a cool feature.\n\n401\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.950\nIt might be cool, it might not be.\n\n402\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.720\nIf you're in low powered mode you might\nbe trying to save your battery power and\n\n403\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.410\nyou might not want this\nthing to kick on and\n\n404\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.010\nthen consume the rest of your battery\npower, cuz any kind of anti-virus software\n\n405\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.780\nis going to have some CPU resources\nthat it's gonna need to use.\n\n406\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.940\nSo there again do you want\nthis scan to run it's startup?\n\n407\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.470\nProbably something you're gonna want.\n\n408\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.130\nIt might not be I mean there's no right or\nwrong way really to do this so\n\n409\n00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.940\nwe could say run every three hours and\nwe could choose save and again security\n\n410\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.800\nclass software, it's making modifications\nto the registry, making modifications\n\n411\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.990\nto key security settings here, and now I\ncould turn around and I could delete this.\n\n412\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.740\nMaybe I didn't want it to\nrun every three hours.\n\n413\n00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.280\nMaybe I come back and define that\neverything in the settings is exactly\n\n414\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.640\nthe way I want it, but\nI want to change how often it runs.\n\n415\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.460\nSo I can do that too.\n\n416\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.310\nI come back here and\n\n417\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.070\nI can say two if I want, and I also\nhave some additional settings we can do.\n\n418\n00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:17.500\nRemember heuristics you can do as well\n\n419\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.240\nroot kits and then remember those file\nlocations all things that you can do here.\n\n420\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.611\nSo one of the things I was thinking, Mike,\nyou wanna put this software to the test?\n\n421\n00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:27.441\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n422\n00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:28.450\n>> And see what it can do?\n\n423\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.930\nNow I'm not gonna, well,\nI'll tell you what, I'll go ahead and\n\n424\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.510\nsave the settings here.\n\n425\n00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:37.560\nAnd so we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is.\n\n426\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.690\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and\nset a virus on this thing.\n\n427\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.300\nLet's test and see if it's giving\nus some real time protection.\n\n428\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.280\nSo we'll click on this virus here.\n\n429\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.420\nAnd we'll see if it's oh, there we go.\n\n430\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.415\nBoy, that didn't take long.\n\n431\n00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n432\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.250\n>> It got that one right away.\n\n433\n00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.230\nSo notice that it's found a virus here.\n\n434\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.620\nAnd it's telling me exactly\nwhere it's located,\n\n435\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.570\nand it's telling me, hey do you\nwant me to do something about this?\n\n436\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.170\nI can do something about this.\n\n437\n00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.710\nNow also remember,\nwe've talked about false positives.\n\n438\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:11.250\nAll right, if we're doing security\nresearch, we might have, and\n\n439\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.480\ndoing heuristics, right.\n\n440\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.140\nI think it's a virus, I'm not sure it's\na virus, it looks like a virus and\n\n441\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.390\nthen it quarantines it.\n\n442\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.430\nAnd now you have a problem with one\nof your lineup business applications,\n\n443\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.340\nor maybe your operating system.\n\n444\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.950\nMost of the time it's not\nan operating system, but\n\n445\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.780\nmaybe your operating system isn't working\nthe way it wants to or the way it should.\n\n446\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.480\nWell you can turn around and\nyou could say ignore the threat if it is\n\n447\n00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.920\na false positive and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n448\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.520\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna say protect me and\n\n449\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.710\nwe'll see here that it does tell\nus that it has been removed.\n\n450\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:40.360\nI'll tell you what.\n\n451\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.950\nLet's find a little information, too.\n\n452\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.000\nThat's one of the good things to do.\n\n453\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.400\nYou've got these little\njump links here and\n\n454\n00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.950\nit's probably going to connect\noutbound to the internet.\n\n455\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.050\nIt's gonna go to AVG Threat Labs and\nI'm not sure if it'll connect here.\n\n456\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.782\nIt might.\n\n457\n00:21:53.782 --> 00:21:58.630\nBut anyways if you want to get more\ninformation on that virus that it is\n\n458\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.830\nconnected to or that it's quarantined,\nif you want to find out maybe you want to\n\n459\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.760\nmake sure,\nmaybe it can't find the extension\n\n460\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.460\nanymore because we have quarantined it\nbecause it is gone which is a good thing.\n\n461\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:16.790\nSo If you want to find out whether\nI should flag a false positive as\n\n462\n00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:22.440\na valid extension or a valid file,\nyou can go to the AVG Threat Labs and when\n\n463\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.260\nit pulls up the definition to the virus,\nit might say that this process is benign.\n\n464\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.820\nAnd it's flagged a lot of times as\na false positive, but it's safe and\n\n465\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.870\nyou can say just go ahead and ignore it.\n\n466\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.920\nYou can turn around and\n\n467\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.280\ntake that information and\nput it back into your exclusions list,\n\n468\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.180\nso that it doesn't scan again and\nthen you go through this process again.\n\n469\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.520\nYou've gotta go back,\nyou can see some of these files,\n\n470\n00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.690\nthey've got these crazy long characters\nand you can't identify it easily.\n\n471\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.330\nYou can put it in your exclusions list and\n\n472\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.130\nthen the next time it goes back\nyou can turn around and re-run it.\n\n473\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.850\nAnd you don't have to worry about it cause\nit'll put its blinders on and it'll say,\n\n474\n00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:58.020\nyou've told me to ignore that one,\nI'm gonna ignore it.\n\n475\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.920\nMake sure that it is a false positive\ncause if you tell it to ignore it and\n\n476\n00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.120\nit's not a virus,\nit's not gonna pick and choose.\n\n477\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.655\nIt gonna say you told me to ignore it so\nI'm not gonna go back there.\n\n478\n00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:09.950\nMike, It does look like AVG's\nin here has done it's job.\n\n479\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.400\nOur total protection here.\n\n480\n00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.980\nThank goodness.\n\n481\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.330\n>> It was one of the faster responses\nout of the few we've tested so far.\n\n482\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.290\n>> It really is.\n\n483\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.540\nAVG seems like they're on the money.\n\n484\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.730\nIt got to that engine really quick.\n\n485\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.760\nThere again, if you have got\nthe computational power use hueristics.\n\n486\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.280\nIf you are maybe thinking if your system\ndoes not have the computational power\n\n487\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.120\nwell, you might throttle down as\nmuch of the CPU and the priority so\n\n488\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.870\nyou can set it to a lower\npriority on your scan.\n\n489\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.950\nSo if you are in a middle of a line of\nbusiness application like something\n\n490\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.150\nlike Photoshop out there that\ntakes a lot of resources,\n\n491\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.270\nyou don't have to worry about it\nconsuming your CPU utilization.\n\n492\n00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.910\nAnd can still get your job done.\n\n493\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.130\n>> Very good well that's again a lot\nof great information there of our\n\n494\n00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.300\nconsumer grade antivirus products.\n\n495\n00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.580\nThis one being AVG Protection.\n\n496\n00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.100\n>> That's right.\n\n497\n00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.060\n>> Thank you for those fantastic\nexamples and demonstrations, but\n\n498\n00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.820\nthat's gonna do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n499\n00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.780\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n500\n00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.500\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n501\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.865\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.210\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in this\nepisode we're going to continue taking\n\n4\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.600\na look at antivirus and anti-malware,\n\n5\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.810\nspecifically moving into the enterprise\nsolutions that we have available to us.\n\n6\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.630\nAnd joining me today in the studio to\nhelp lend his expertise on that topic,\n\n7\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.430\nnone other than my good\nfriend Mr Wes Bryan,\n\n8\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.170\nWes welcome to the studio\nhow are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.960\n>> I'm doing great man and it's great to\nbe back here as always, and that's right,\n\n10\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.940\nwe're gonna move into\nthe enterprise side of things.\n\n11\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.050\nNow if you haven't seen some of\nthe consumer products we've been talking\n\n12\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.600\nabout and some of the concepts\nbehind that go back and\n\n13\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.590\ncheck those out, because when we move into\nthe enterprise solutions here, one of\n\n14\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.570\nthe things that we're going to be looking\nat is more of a centralized management.\n\n15\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.480\nNow as you've seen some of\nthe products that we've looked at,\n\n16\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.630\nif you're in a smaller home environment,\nit will let you sometimes manage a handful\n\n17\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.290\nof computers but\nthat's really all it's designed for.\n\n18\n00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.480\nIt's not really designed to\nscale up to large organizations,\n\n19\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.320\norganizations that can go 100 computers,\n1,000 computers, beyond 5,000 computers.\n\n20\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.510\nBecause when we start managing\nthese amounts, quantities,\n\n21\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.920\nif you will, of clients, we start needing\nto import information into databases.\n\n22\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.600\nAnd the smaller, consumer-grade\nantivirus really isn't gonna\n\n23\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.310\nbe able to cut the mustard, if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.060\nSo one of the ones that we're gonna look\nat today is something known as the system\n\n25\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.660\nend point protection.\n\n26\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.280\nAnd we're going to manage it through\nsomething called the system end point\n\n27\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.420\nprotection manager.\n\n28\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.150\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right in and see what we've got.\n\n29\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.740\nOn our server, this is where we're going\nto start with, the server installation.\n\n30\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.110\nNow I've gone ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.350\nI've already downloaded from Symantec,\nthe installation files.\n\n32\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.350\nThey come by default in\na seven zip package there.\n\n33\n00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.210\nSo I've already download Seven Zip.\n\n34\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.750\nI've already extracted the files here.\n\n35\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.220\nSo just keep that in mind that\nthis has already been done.\n\n36\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.310\nNow when you run the setup,\nit's fairly easy,\n\n37\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.720\njust like any other piece of\nsoftware that you install.\n\n38\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.960\nIt's got the little setup\nicon somewhere in there.\n\n39\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.280\nIt says application next to it,\nfairly easy to find.\n\n40\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.930\nNow when you start the installer it's\na really intuitive point and click wizard.\n\n41\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.700\nIt does have a couple levels of complexity\ndepending on what kind of setup you want\n\n42\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.110\nand you'll see that coming up here.\n\n43\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.450\nYou can do a typical installation and\nit makes it a little bit easier and\n\n44\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.240\nI'll explain coming up what that means.\n\n45\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.990\nOr you can get very customized\nin what you want to set up here.\n\n46\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.440\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart the installer process here.\n\n47\n00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.990\nFairly easy, nothing like having\na door in front of a door.\n\n48\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.900\nYou install, and then we'll tell it again,\nyes, we really do wanna install.\n\n49\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.120\nAnd when the installer starts up, one of\nthe things you'll notice is that we've got\n\n50\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.250\na few tasks that we're\ngonna take care of today.\n\n51\n00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.150\nWe're gonna take care of installing the\nserver itself, configuring the server, and\n\n52\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.920\ncreating the database.\n\n53\n00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.630\nAnd that's one of the things that really,\n\n54\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.400\nreally sets the enterprise level software\napart from the consumer grade, right?\n\n55\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.650\nWe have so much information, potentially,\nyou don't have to, but you can potentially\n\n56\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.400\nscale up to so much information that\nyou're gonna need a place to store it and\n\n57\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.200\nmy local thumb drive inside of a Soho\nis not really gonna work for me.\n\n58\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.570\nSo we'll go ahead and move through this\ninstallation, and you have your EULA here,\n\n59\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.860\nyour End User License Agreement\nthat you have to accept.\n\n60\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.230\nDon't worry, we won't be testing Dan's\nknowledge of clause 32a subsection b here.\n\n61\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.290\nWe'll go ahead and move on.\n\n62\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.430\nThe other thing, too,\nare the installation requirements.\n\n63\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.810\nFor the most part today, the installation\nrequirements, most of your servers,\n\n64\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.650\nyou're gonna meet this.\n\n65\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.660\nFour gigs of disk space,\nhard drive space, a gig on your CPUs,\n\n66\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.600\nwe're pretty good today,\nby today's standards.\n\n67\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.090\nAnd when it comes to RAM, for\n\n68\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.930\nthe most part, Dan RAM about a gig,\nnot too bad, right?\n\n69\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.980\n>> Yeah, not too bad.\n\n70\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.150\nI've worked with Symantec's\nproducts before.\n\n71\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.210\nThey're really good products, and\nyou can really customize them.\n\n72\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.000\nThe servers, they're really not,\nthey don't need a whole lot of horsepower,\n\n73\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030\nbecause they're not really\ndoing the computing.\n\n74\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.430\nThey're not the ones that\nare searching for viruses.\n\n75\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.700\nThat's what the client is doing.\n\n76\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.060\nAll the client's doing is reporting back.\n\n77\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.270\nIt's keeping that database,\n\n78\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.570\nwhat Wes was talking about, of health\nstatuses and deployment packages and\n\n79\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.670\nany of our updates to the thing,\nthat's where this is coming in.\n\n80\n00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.140\nSo you don't really need the biggest,\n\n81\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.360\nbaddest boy you've got in the server\ncloset to make this guy run.\n\n82\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.140\nWe used to just use two gigs of RAM.\n\n83\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.080\nOf course, this was a few years ago.\n\n84\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.410\nMaybe it's a little bit more bulky now,\n\n85\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.810\nbut at that point it's\na really simple set-up.\n\n86\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.320\n>> It is and if you are scaling up larger,\nvery good point too,\n\n87\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.970\nif you are scaling up larger, that's\nwhat they'll recommend as we go through\n\n88\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.290\nthe installer process to off load this if\nyou're going to have a large database.\n\n89\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.670\nYou're going to put that on a database\nserver, and some of you probably know\n\n90\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.360\nthat server most likely is going\nto have some power behind it.\n\n91\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.190\nSo we'll go ahead and choose install.\n\n92\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.720\nAnd when it goes to\nthe installation process, again,\n\n93\n00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.820\nyou can see it's relatively fast.\n\n94\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.010\nIt depends on some of the options that\nwere gonna see that we're gonna configure\n\n95\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.650\nhere in a bit.\n\n96\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.730\nIt could take several minutes.\n\n97\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.920\nIt could take a while.\n\n98\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.780\nBut for the most part not really to bad.\n\n99\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.260\nIt copies the files over just like any\ninstaller that you guys have seen.\n\n100\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.400\nAnd it goes through some post-installation\ntasks of cleaning up different files and\n\n101\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.710\nlogs and stuff.\n\n102\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.710\nI've already got one installed\nhere ready to go for us.\n\n103\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.310\nAnd you can see when\nthe interface brings itself up\n\n104\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.870\nit's really nothing more\nthan a web interface.\n\n105\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.880\nAnd when you log in here, and\n\n106\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.460\nI'll show you guys how this\nall works behind the scenes.\n\n107\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.340\nYou basically log into the server\nthrough the web interface,\n\n108\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.260\nso again, for the most part\nit's not really too difficult.\n\n109\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.550\nI bet you if we slide back\nover here you'll see,\n\n110\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.520\nit's already pretty much ready to go.\n\n111\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.480\nNow the next portion of this is to\nconfigure the management server\n\n112\n00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.730\nitself, right.\n\n113\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.350\nThe management server has to have\nthe components installed before we can\n\n114\n00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.100\nconfigure them.\n\n115\n00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.450\nSo kind of a logical order there\nif I do say so myself, and\n\n116\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.650\nit starts the management\nserver configuration wizard.\n\n117\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:00.630\nAnd again depending on how complex\nof an installation you want or\n\n118\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.020\nthe environment that you want will dictate\nsome of the options that you can use.\n\n119\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.862\nSo for instance, if I wanted to,\nlet me show you guys here.\n\n120\n00:06:08.862 --> 00:06:09.524\nAll right.\n\n121\n00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:14.535\nDefault configuration,\nnotice we're talking about 100 computers,\n\n122\n00:06:14.535 --> 00:06:16.460\n100 computers or less.\n\n123\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.380\nIf you go with a custom installation,\nyou're talking more than 100 computers.\n\n124\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.530\nAnd this other option here is,\nwhat if my server itself?\n\n125\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.640\nWhat if it goes offline,\nneeds some maintenance,\n\n126\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.370\nI need to reinstall the hard drive?\n\n127\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.940\nWell you can also restore communications\nto prior deployed clients if you need to,\n\n128\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.960\nand you can use a recovery file.\n\n129\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.360\nAnd you'll actually see that,\n\n130\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.560\ncuz that's a password protected file that\nwe have to configure during this setup for\n\n131\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.990\nthat purpose, just in case the server goes\noffline, it crashes, the hard drive fails,\n\n132\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.590\nI would say, it gets a virus but\nthis is your management server.\n\n133\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.800\nIf it gets a virus,\nsomething's wrong there [LAUGH].\n\n134\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.590\nSo we'll go ahead and\nmove a little bit forward.\n\n135\n00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.250\nNow with the default configuration,\n\n136\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.854\none of the things it's going to do is\nit's going to have an internal database.\n\n137\n00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:09.240\nAnd that's one of the major\nthings that separates this from\n\n138\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.420\nthat other custom configuration.\n\n139\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.380\nIf you're doing the custom configuration,\nyou're going to say,\n\n140\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.370\nhey we've got a a Microsoft SQL server\nout there, we're gonna configure\n\n141\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.280\nconnections to that or MySQL, and\nwe're gonna configure connections to that.\n\n142\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.640\nNow, some of the first things\nthat we're gonna do here,\n\n143\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.910\nis we're gonna go through company name,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.080\nAnd, I'll set my company\nname here real quick.\n\n145\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.510\nNJO.\n\n146\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.282\nAnd password here, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust type a super secret password.\n\n147\n00:07:35.282 --> 00:07:39.330\nAnd then the administrator, where\nyou're gonna send information, right.\n\n148\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.530\nIf I need notifications, you might have\nheard Dan talk about a lot of data,\n\n149\n00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.340\na lot of notifications that\nare gonna be sent out.\n\n150\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.580\nWell it needs an address,\nan email address, so that\n\n151\n00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.500\nif you are the administrator over this\nserver, you could find that information.\n\n152\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.858\nSo I'll go ahead and\nput my email address in here.\n\n153\n00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:58.518\nProvided I can type.\n\n154\n00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:01.318\nYou're gonna see that that is\na challenging obstacle for me.\n\n155\n00:08:05.106 --> 00:08:05.842\nAll right,\n\n156\n00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:11.180\nnow the other thing that's great about\nthis too is you might be the third party.\n\n157\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.920\nSomebody might be coming to you and\nsaying, hey,\n\n158\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.800\nwe want you to manage our system, or\nexcuse me, semantic end point protection,\n\n159\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.970\nand this is where you would\nhave partner information.\n\n160\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.850\nWe don't have that here, so\nwe're just gonna leave those fields blank.\n\n161\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.390\nNow, remember the outbound notifications,\ntoo.\n\n162\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.830\nYou can integrate this in with your SMTP\nserver so that these can be notifications\n\n163\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.180\nand compliance status reports that you set\nup can all be sent to your SMTP sever.\n\n164\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.730\nNow, I don't have an SMTP server here,\nso I'm not gonna configure it.\n\n165\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.770\nBut even if you did, and let's say\nyou didn't know that information,\n\n166\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.700\nmaybe you're a large enough organization\nwhere maybe you've got a team that manages\n\n167\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.090\nall the email.\n\n168\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:55.030\nThen you can also configure this later if\nyou don't have those stats right there.\n\n169\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.510\nNow I'm also going to uncheck, running\nthe live update during the installation.\n\n170\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.950\nNow, you might ask,\n\n171\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.730\nwhy would I want to uncheck running\nthe live installation during update?\n\n172\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:11.660\nWell, for my purposes here, this can take\nup to an hour, because what it's going\n\n173\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.320\nto do is it's going to connect out to\nsemantic servers, and it's going to say.\n\n174\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.710\nGive me everything that I don't have,\nbased on a time stamp that I see in this\n\n175\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.590\ninstallation right now, and it's basically\ngonna download all your product updates.\n\n176\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.270\nNow your gonna see in a second\nhere as I show you that\n\n177\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.980\nyou really do wanna run these updates.\n\n178\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.260\nSo be careful with that one.\n\n179\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.550\nI'm just doing this for\nthe purposes of the installation.\n\n180\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.640\nYou know, we always say update\nyour antivirus software.\n\n181\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.070\nWell you can't tell somebody\nin the home environment,\n\n182\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.680\nyou keep your antivirus updated.\n\n183\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.190\nAnd then do an installation on a major\ncorporate enterprise server and\n\n184\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.100\nsay, we're not gonna update anything.\n\n185\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.200\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n186\n00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.460\nData collection, all right?\n\n187\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.120\nMost all software that is\nanti-malware software,\n\n188\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.790\ndoesn't matter if it's consumer grade,\ndoesn't matter if it's enterprise grade.\n\n189\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.530\nIt works off reputation and\nstatistical data it collects because,\n\n190\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.770\nhopefully it doesn't happen, but\nwhat happens if you do get a file?\n\n191\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.460\nYou wanna be able to find out\nhas this file been seen before?\n\n192\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.430\nDo we recognize it as a potential virus.\n\n193\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.550\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and opt in to this.\n\n194\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.540\nI'm gonna leave that where it's at.\n\n195\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.380\nNow what we have here\nare some communication ports.\n\n196\n00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.950\nEverything's the default.\n\n197\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.660\nAll right,\nnow in the custom configuration,\n\n198\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.060\nyou could modify these if you want.\n\n199\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.530\nIf you only have a smaller environment,\nand you don't wanna configure them,\n\n200\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.210\nyou can leave them at the defaults,\nand that's what I've done here.\n\n201\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.640\nNow what if I don't know what\nthe port numbers are, right?\n\n202\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.430\nMaybe I'm not taking\ndocumentation on this right now.\n\n203\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.958\nWell, one of the great things here is, and\nI would recommend doing this, is you can\n\n204\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.293\ncopy if to the clipboard and then the next\nthing that I would do is come out here and\n\n205\n00:10:53.293 --> 00:10:54.802\nmaybe just create a quick.\n\n206\n00:10:57.367 --> 00:10:58.730\nText document here.\n\n207\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.630\nAnd then I'll just go ahead and paste that\ninformation inside of this notepad here,\n\n208\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.500\nand the other thing too\nis it has your password.\n\n209\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.780\nSo it's good information to have and\nI would recommend saving it and\n\n210\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.050\nthen saving it maybe not to\nthe server's desktop like I just did,\n\n211\n00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.600\nprobably put this in a protected location\nwhere only your administrators can get to.\n\n212\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.860\nAnd, again, this is your summary screen\nand you start the installation process.\n\n213\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.620\nNow, again when you don't\nrun the live update,\n\n214\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.510\nthe installation process,\nit's not really too bad.\n\n215\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.800\nI mean, for the most part it goes\nthrough the process fairly easy.\n\n216\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.410\nBut what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n217\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.350\nskip over to the machine that I have\nthat already has the installations done.\n\n218\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.150\nAnd by the way,\nit's already go the live update run too.\n\n219\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.680\nSo we can see more of\nthe technologies that are here.\n\n220\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.290\nOne of the things that you have,\nis this quick start menu.\n\n221\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.550\nAll right, you can see some of\nthe information in here, right.\n\n222\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.180\nFor instance, running Windows Live update,\nif you want to take,\n\n223\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.870\ngo through a product tour,\nyou can do that.\n\n224\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.110\nLicense status,\nI don't have this thing activated.\n\n225\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.150\nI'm on a trial subscription, if you will.\n\n226\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.280\nAnd you can see here,\n\n227\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.500\nit's gonna expire, I believe midway\nthrough the end of next month here.\n\n228\n00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.430\nAll right, so, we'll go ahead and\nclose that off.\n\n229\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.700\nAnd then once this is done,\nthis is the interface that you get.\n\n230\n00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.960\nThis is your dashboard.\n\n231\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.850\nNow, the dashboard is a quick heads\nup of the activity that's happening,\n\n232\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.220\nor lack thereof, hopefully.\n\n233\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.840\nWhen we talk about viruses,\nhopefully the lack thereof.\n\n234\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.830\nNow, you've got some basic things that\nyou can do when you start to configure\n\n235\n00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.470\nthis server.\n\n236\n00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:45.620\nWe have on the left hand side,\nall right, we have the clients.\n\n237\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.610\nAll right,\nnow when we look at the clients here,\n\n238\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.400\nyou're gonna see that it really follows.\n\n239\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.330\nIn fact Dan and I were talking about\nthis before we started the episode,\n\n240\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.170\nit really follows like an LDAP format\nwhere you can create your groups,\n\n241\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.980\nyou can add your clients to it.\n\n242\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.220\nSo if you're familiar with, already,\n\n243\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:08.120\nwith an active directory environment, this\nreally shouldn't be too difficult for you.\n\n244\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.080\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do\n\n245\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.570\nis we're gonna create a few groups here\nand all I'm gonna do is right click\n\n246\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.900\non the top part of the hierarchy here and\nI'm just gonna choose add group.\n\n247\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.960\nNow my group here, we'll go ahead and\ndo MJO and we'll say hey,\n\n248\n00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.550\nthese are going to be the dev computers.\n\n249\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:32.210\nNow, this is really arbitrary to me\nit's whatever I need for my company.\n\n250\n00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.909\nNow we'll go ahead and choose OK.\n\n251\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.180\nAnd you'll see that there\nthat group comes up.\n\n252\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.020\nMaybe we've got some other groups that\nwe need just to kind of give us a little\n\n253\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.840\ninfrastructure here.\n\n254\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.610\nMaybe we're gonna do, let's say NJO and\nwe'll do Marketing Computers.\n\n255\n00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.630\n>> Now, Wes, what is the real\npurpose behind creating groups,\n\n256\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.250\nother than just organizationally I can\nlook at the management software and\n\n257\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.640\ngo oh well here's all my dev computers or\nall my management computers and all that?\n\n258\n00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.790\nIs there any other purpose for\nusing the groups inside of the manager?\n\n259\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.430\n>> That's a great question, Dan.\n\n260\n00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.780\nLet's say for instance maybe you have\nyou know like your development computers\n\n261\n00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.620\nare constantly hitting the internet,\nright?\n\n262\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.980\nThey're doing research.\n\n263\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.980\nThey have access to more higher\nlevel functions on your computer,\n\n264\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.670\nbecause they need to develop products.\n\n265\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.570\nWell, not necessarily that they're admins,\nbut again,\n\n266\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.460\nthey might have access to more\nsensitive information that typically,\n\n267\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.410\nmaybe your marketing,\nyour average marketing team doesn't.\n\n268\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.000\nSo what this does is give you the ability\nto separate your computers and\n\n269\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.630\nyou'll see here in a bit\nthat we can create policies.\n\n270\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.270\nAnd I can assign a policy to the dev\ncomputers group based on whatever my\n\n271\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.930\ncriteria is, that maybe I don't want,\nkinda like we say in Active Directory,\n\n272\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.810\nI don't want to affect everybody.\n\n273\n00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.070\nMaybe it becomes a little bit too\nrestrictive, and the dev team can't get\n\n274\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.370\nwhat they need to get done,\nversus, like, the marketing group.\n\n275\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.820\nSo it's a good way, that if you are gonna\nimplement policies through this software,\n\n276\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.270\nthat you can separate those.\n\n277\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.310\nThe other one that I was\ngonna show you here, too.\n\n278\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.910\nMaybe you've got the BYOD situation.\n\n279\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.980\nMaybe you've got mobile devices.\n\n280\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.950\nMobile devices are gonna\nprobably have different policies,\n\n281\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.550\na lot of the same settings as far as\nwe're looking for malware and stuff,\n\n282\n00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.530\nbut they tend to travel, right,\nas they go through different networks, so\n\n283\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.800\nmaybe you have even more restrictive.\n\n284\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.370\nMaybe those are the most\nrestrictive devices you have.\n\n285\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.330\nCuz you wanna keep them protected.\n\n286\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.190\nSo we can do that too.\n\n287\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:30.180\nSo we'll do NJO, and\nwe'll do Mobile Devices, and there we go.\n\n288\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.640\nSo when you start this up just keep in\nmind that you can group your computers\n\n289\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.880\ntogether the way you want,\nyou can set policies.\n\n290\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.790\nThe other thing that I was, along with\nthat question, Dan, was maybe I wanna\n\n291\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:47.460\ndeploy a scan but I don't want that\nscan to go out to 5000 computers, right?\n\n292\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.793\nMaybe I wanna have a scheduled scan,\n\n293\n00:15:48.793 --> 00:15:51.208\nbecause that's gonna be a lot of\ntraffic on your network, right?\n\n294\n00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:55.568\nSo maybe I wanna systematically, I've got\nsome kind of method to the madness here.\n\n295\n00:15:55.568 --> 00:15:58.948\nI say okay, on Tuesday night,\nthese four 400 computers,\n\n296\n00:15:58.948 --> 00:16:02.398\nthey're gonna get,\nI'm gonna send out active scans to them.\n\n297\n00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:05.626\nAnd then maybe the next night,\nI'm gonna have a scheduled scan that says,\n\n298\n00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:07.480\nit's gonna go to these 400 computers.\n\n299\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.322\nRather than just applying the policy\nright here at the top, and\n\n300\n00:16:11.322 --> 00:16:15.892\nnow I've got 5,000 computers all\nconnecting outbound to a semantics\n\n301\n00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:20.266\nreputation database and it can generate\na lot of network traffic here.\n\n302\n00:16:20.266 --> 00:16:24.240\nSo, it's good to have.\n\n303\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.620\nNow comes the fun part.\n\n304\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.505\nNow we get to actually start to\ndeploy the software to the endpoint.\n\n305\n00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:33.635\nNow before we do this, one of the things\nthat I wanna show you here is,\n\n306\n00:16:33.635 --> 00:16:35.315\nI've already got a machine, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:35.315 --> 00:16:38.625\nI've already got a machine started here,\nand you can see that.\n\n308\n00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:44.455\nDepending on where you are in\nyour client hierarchy here,\n\n309\n00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:49.275\nyou can add clients just by selecting\nthe group that you've created.\n\n310\n00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.370\nAnd then notice down here at the bottom,\nwe've got the add client option.\n\n311\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.410\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and we will put\na computer, I'm gonna put this computer\n\n312\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.840\ngenerically just in my company\nhere with the other one.\n\n313\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.880\nAll right and we'll choose add client.\n\n314\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.310\nNow we've also got a few options for\nadding your clients.\n\n315\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.160\nAnd depending on what you're\ndoing will dictate which of these\n\n316\n00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.500\noptions you're gonna use.\n\n317\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:20.020\nNow, earlier that client that\nI have in the background here,\n\n318\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.020\nthis Win 7 client, in fact let me\ngo ahead and just cancel this.\n\n319\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.800\nThis Win 7 client,\nit was already in the database.\n\n320\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.200\nAnd for some reason it got deleted,\nand on the endpoint side,\n\n321\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.910\nthe work station side,\nit's still has semantic endpoint there.\n\n322\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.870\nBut the problem is it's no\nlonger in the database.\n\n323\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.600\nAnd the reason I bring that up is because\nthat's one of the options you have here\n\n324\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.940\nin adding a client.\n\n325\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.300\nLet's say that you already do have\na client that's in the system but for\n\n326\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.940\nsome reason, for whatever reason,\nwhether it's through user error,\n\n327\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.470\nwhich probably be the reason it wasn't\nthere for me [LAUGH], it disappears.\n\n328\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.620\nIt's no longer there.\n\n329\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.620\nThat's the option down here and we'll\njust spend a second here on this one.\n\n330\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.950\nThis is what's known as a CUP.\n\n331\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.480\nThis is the communication I said\nearlier was a client update package,\n\n332\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.650\ncommunication update package.\n\n333\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.860\nIf you've already got semantic\nend point on the workstation, and\n\n334\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.445\nfor whatever reason it's no longer in\nyour database, well all you need to do is\n\n335\n00:18:13.445 --> 00:18:17.820\nre-establish the communication between\nthe server and the client itself.\n\n336\n00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.510\nSo you can do that option here.\n\n337\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.380\nAnd it works on Windows and\nit works in Mac, as well.\n\n338\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.820\nAnd when you run this\nit's not going to deploy,\n\n339\n00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.600\nthere's no reason to reinvent the wheel.\n\n340\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.750\nIf it's already got the software, there's\nno reason to deploy the software again,\n\n341\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.680\nall you need to do is\nreestablish the communication.\n\n342\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.160\nAll right, if you already have an existing\npackage you can do that as well,\n\n343\n00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.050\nbut what we're going to do is,\nwe're going to do this from scratch.\n\n344\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.890\nWe're going to do a new\ndeployment here completely.\n\n345\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.100\nAll right.\n\n346\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.360\nNow we also have a few options as well.\n\n347\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.790\nAll right, with these options you can see,\n\n348\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.620\nup here at the top,\nI've got a couple preexisting packages.\n\n349\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.670\nYou've got some for Windows, right?\n\n350\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.210\nAnd you've got some for Mac.\n\n351\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.750\nNow a good thing is 32 bit verses 64 bit,\nnotice only one option is selected.\n\n352\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:09.050\nBut with that option, notice it includes\nthe 64-bit client, and the 32-bit client.\n\n353\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.950\nThat is something you also have to be\naware of when you're gonna deploy this,\n\n354\n00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.350\ncuz as you're gonna see,\nwe're gonna do a remote deployment.\n\n355\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.483\nSo you have to be aware ahead of time,\n\n356\n00:19:18.483 --> 00:19:24.458\nwhether you've got 32-bit\nmachines versus 64-bit machines.\n\n357\n00:19:24.458 --> 00:19:26.235\n>> Wes is creating his\nown architecture here.\n\n358\n00:19:26.235 --> 00:19:27.715\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n359\n00:19:27.715 --> 00:19:29.380\nYou have to know that.\n\n360\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.760\nAnd you might say,\nwell that's easy enough.\n\n361\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.130\nIf you've got 5,000 computers and\nno documentation,\n\n362\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.930\nyou might be surprised at how easy\nthat information is to find or not.\n\n363\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.020\nNow the other thing we have too,\nis this doesn't just work,\n\n364\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.080\nI've talked a lot about the workstation,\nright?\n\n365\n00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.560\nWell this works on servers as well, too.\n\n366\n00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.020\nSo you have full protection for\nclients, full protection for\n\n367\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.560\nservers or basic protection for servers.\n\n368\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.630\nNotice they don't give you that option for\nclients, right?\n\n369\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.180\nWe want our clients to be protected.\n\n370\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.300\n>> Yeah, Wes, this is actually a really\nimportant part of deploying a service or\n\n371\n00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:07.340\na client should I say, is why would I\nhave this basic level of protection?\n\n372\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.580\nI have dealt with servers that didn't have\nany implement protection on it whatsoever.\n\n373\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.340\nHad no virus software whatsoever on it.\n\n374\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.100\nWhy is that?\n\n375\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.070\nCause anti virus software\ntends to conflict with\n\n376\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.770\na lot of third party software.\n\n377\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.800\nSo there are times when\nyou'll deploy a server,\n\n378\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.390\nbut you don't have to worry about it\nat that point in time because usually,\n\n379\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.710\nthose types of servers\ndon't touch the Internet.\n\n380\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:31.298\nThey're internal in your computer,\nthey're firewalled out of their minds,\n\n381\n00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:34.859\ncompletely isolated except for\nthe only in rows that come in,\n\n382\n00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.340\nwhich is the software that they work with.\n\n383\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.460\nSo there are gonna be times when you're\ngonna choose that last option or\n\n384\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.410\nno option at all.\n\n385\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.480\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n386\n00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.950\nAnd you might be under some kind of\ncompliance agreement, too, where it says\n\n387\n00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.450\nthis server, even though it's within your\nnetworks, you're not in control of it.\n\n388\n00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.080\nSo you can't push that information.\n\n389\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.490\nSo if you've got any\nkind of SLA out there.\n\n390\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.700\nSo, that's really good too.\n\n391\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.910\nNow, when it comes to\nthe installation settings themselves,\n\n392\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:03.150\ndepends on how much bandwidth you have and\nhow much time you have, right?\n\n393\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.730\nIf you're initially setting this up and\nyou do a full deployment\n\n394\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.500\nto 5,000 computers, your network\nperformance might completely tank.\n\n395\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.520\nSo a lot of planning is gonna go on.\n\n396\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.640\nI know I'm kinda just\nmoving through these steps.\n\n397\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.460\nAnd like Dan has said too,\nyou really have to plan.\n\n398\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.810\nBecause if I deploy\nthe full installation size.\n\n399\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.350\nRight?\n>> Yeah, how big is that package?\n\n400\n00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.020\n>> Oh my goodness.\n\n401\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.020\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n402\n00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.810\nmultiple Multiplied by 5,000, right?\n\n403\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.980\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what I'm gonna do here is again, for\n\n404\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.380\npurposes of demonstration so\nit doesn't take forever,\n\n405\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.770\nI'm gonna do the reduced\ninstallation size.\n\n406\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.550\nNow here again,\nrecommended is all the content.\n\n407\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.685\nRight, it gives you the highest\nlevel of protection right away.\n\n408\n00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:45.245\nNow what do we mean by that?\n\n409\n00:21:45.245 --> 00:21:48.345\nWell, all content means it's gonna\ndo something like automatically\n\n410\n00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:49.475\ngenerate its updates.\n\n411\n00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:54.185\nIt's gonna give everything to the computer\nthat it needs to have to immediately\n\n412\n00:21:54.185 --> 00:21:55.625\nhave the protection.\n\n413\n00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:59.215\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna cut against the grain here.\n\n414\n00:21:59.215 --> 00:22:02.605\nI'm gonna do Basic content and again,\nkeep in mind, I'm doing this for\n\n415\n00:22:02.605 --> 00:22:06.280\nthe purposes of speeding\nup the deployment here.\n\n416\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.960\n>> Yeah, normally you'd be going full\nblown package, give 'em everything, all\n\n417\n00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.810\nthe bells and whistles, because you bought\nthe thing and you want to use every bell\n\n418\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.640\nand whistle that it has, but again that\nwould take us forever, and I've done that.\n\n419\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.460\nWhat you want to in those case,\ndo what Wes said, make some groups and\n\n420\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.510\ndeploy in stages.\n\n421\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.520\nSend out a hundred a night.\n\n422\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.180\nAnd that way if anything goes\nwrong you can easily go back and\n\n423\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.010\nfind out where that is and if everything\ngoes right, well then great and\n\n424\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.790\nyou can move on to the next\nhundred batch until you get done.\n\n425\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.390\nIf you have super large environment,\n\n426\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.430\nsomething well lover a thousand computers,\nit's just going to take some time,\n\n427\n00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.560\nit's going to take a a team\nof people to get that done.\n\n428\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.590\nI've been a part of that before.\n\n429\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.580\nIt's just effort.\n\n430\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.740\nIt's just part of the process.\n\n431\n00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.500\n>> It really is.\n\n432\n00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.980\nIt's a lot easier to undo changes from\nmaybe one of the groups that we created.\n\n433\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.050\nRight?\nMaybe we tried to deploy this out to\n\n434\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.260\nthe The Dev team and the Dev team comes up\nand says, I don't know what you did, but\n\n435\n00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.850\nnow we've got some problems.\n\n436\n00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.170\nWe haven't done things like application\nwhite listing at this point, and\n\n437\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.150\nnow we've broken our computers.\n\n438\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.315\nWe've made them so\nsecure that even we can't do our,\n\n439\n00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:10.795\nour own jobs so it is something\nthat you have to keep in mind.\n\n440\n00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:15.495\nThat's a lot easier to undo maybe 100\nchanges than it is to undo 5000 changes.\n\n441\n00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:17.385\nNow we're going ahead anc choose on this.\n\n442\n00:23:17.385 --> 00:23:20.520\nAnd there's a,\nI really like this I have to say,\n\n443\n00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.410\na few different ways to do this, right?\n\n444\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.540\nI do like the fact that you can\ncreate an installation package.\n\n445\n00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.940\nYou can make a web link,\n\n446\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.260\nand you could basically just\nemail that out to your clients.\n\n447\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.230\n>> Which is great for\nVPN users, by the way.\n\n448\n00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.910\nIt's awesome for VPN users.\n\n449\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.560\n>> Yeah, especially, yes,\nif you gotta reach out over the internet.\n\n450\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.750\nOne of things that's cool about this, and\nthe reason I'm gonna do the remote push,\n\n451\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.060\nI'm gonna actually send\nthis out to the endpoints.\n\n452\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.702\nThe reason I want to do that is because\nif you've seen our consumer grade,\n\n453\n00:23:48.702 --> 00:23:51.369\nwell our consumer grade is\nbased around sneakernet.\n\n454\n00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:55.802\nWell that's the cool part about this\ntechnology is the fact that I want to show\n\n455\n00:23:55.802 --> 00:23:57.993\nyou that you can send it out yourself.\n\n456\n00:23:57.993 --> 00:24:01.809\nCuz if we have to save a package, and\nwe have to turn around and install it,\n\n457\n00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:06.120\nthen we're doing sneaker net, we might as\nwell be using consumer grade software,\n\n458\n00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.790\nnot paying thousands of dollars for\nwhat this can perform for us.\n\n459\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.040\nNow we'll go ahead and\nchoose next on this.\n\n460\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.620\nAnd what it's gonna do, there's one\nsetting in here that I configured and\n\n461\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.420\nI want you guys to,\n\n462\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.460\nat least in a Windows environment,\nis the Network Discovery Service.\n\n463\n00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.500\nThis uses network discovery in\nthe protocols behind it to call out to\n\n464\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.140\nthe network and find out.\n\n465\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.400\nHey, who's out there?\n\n466\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.050\nRight?\n\n467\n00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.090\nFirst of all, what network am I on?\n\n468\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.837\nAm I part of a domain?\n\n469\n00:24:34.837 --> 00:24:36.077\nAm I a part of a work group?\n\n470\n00:24:36.077 --> 00:24:41.520\nAnd then once I've found, and you can see\nit's found, it's found our workgroup here.\n\n471\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.330\nThen it's going to go\na little bit farther.\n\n472\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.560\nAnd we'll go ahead and expand that out.\n\n473\n00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.910\nThat's what I'm doing there,\nDan, is expanding it out.\n\n474\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.720\nYou can see the plus symbol.\n\n475\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.470\nSo it knows there's more than one.\n\n476\n00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.600\nIt just doesn't know exactly how many.\n\n477\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.030\nSo now it's using Network Discovery again,\nand it's calling back out to the network\n\n478\n00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.830\nand it's saying, hey,\nwhat are the computers that are out there?\n\n479\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.240\nNow, it's kind of funny because\nit finds itself, right?\n\n480\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.670\nIt has found itself.\n\n481\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.760\nAnd it looks like it's found the other\nserver there that's presently\n\n482\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.730\ninstalling Symantec Endpoint Protection\nin the background.\n\n483\n00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.760\nNow, the one that I'm gonna use is,\nlet's see here.\n\n484\n00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.219\nApparently has gone to sleep.\n\n485\n00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:25.610\nThere we go.\n\n486\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.093\nSo, lets bring that one back\nonline here real quick.\n\n487\n00:25:29.093 --> 00:25:30.500\nIt didn't find that one.\n\n488\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.240\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ntry this one more time.\n\n489\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.570\nIf your computer's offline,\nwell, let me tell you something,\n\n490\n00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.560\nthat's not really going to help you\ntoo much during the installation.\n\n491\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.888\nSo-\n>> Kinda hard to make a connection\n\n492\n00:25:40.888 --> 00:25:41.453\nwith [CROSSTALK].\n\n493\n00:25:41.453 --> 00:25:42.820\n>> Really, [LAUGH] it really is.\n\n494\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.780\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n495\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.510\nWe'll just jump back here real quick.\n\n496\n00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.390\nAnd the good thing is with\nthe reduced installation package and\n\n497\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.200\nstuff, it doesn't really take long.\n\n498\n00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.520\nWe'll use our basic content.\n\n499\n00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.140\nAll right, we won't practice\nit until we get it right,\n\n500\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.800\nwe'll practice it until\nwe can't get it wrong.\n\n501\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.080\n>> That's right.\n\n502\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.690\n>> And again,\nit calls out to the network, it says,\n\n503\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.720\nhey what are the computers out there?\n\n504\n00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.410\nIs there a domain environment,\ncan I send out an LDAP?\n\n505\n00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.140\n>> This will work with active directory,\nright?\n\n506\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.350\n>> Oh absolutely, yeah.\n\n507\n00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.360\nIt fully integrates with Active Directory\nand other LDAP based servers.\n\n508\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.948\nAnd there you see that server's\nonline here, my Win7 install.\n\n509\n00:26:18.948 --> 00:26:25.740\nNow this requires the local\ndefault administrative account.\n\n510\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.780\nSo that's something you also have to know.\n\n511\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.970\nYour machine is going to have to have\nthe local administrative account\n\n512\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:32.810\nto install this.\n\n513\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.980\nSo that's a big security\nvulnerability in and of itself.\n\n514\n00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:41.050\nKeep in mind that you'd probably,\nin an Active Directory environment, you'd\n\n515\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:45.340\nprobably deploy this out, and then push\nout a group policy that turns around and\n\n516\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.710\ndisables that administrative\naccount once the deployment's done.\n\n517\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.292\nSo we'll go ahead and see if.\n\n518\n00:26:52.938 --> 00:26:55.900\nOop!\nIf I could type a password there.\n\n519\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.080\n>> That's impossible, Wes.\n\n520\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.710\n>> No, that is very impossible.\n\n521\n00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.672\nDot, dot, dot, dot, dot.\n\n522\n00:26:59.672 --> 00:27:02.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so and it found it.\n\n523\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:06.900\nIt communicated in, just that quick,\nit communicated with the workstation and\n\n524\n00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.190\nsaid, is that account even active?\n\n525\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.470\nDo I find that account?\n\n526\n00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.700\nSo the good thing is,\n\n527\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.940\nonce you get to the right side here, let\nme bring this up just a little bit there.\n\n528\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.870\nJust back buttons and\nnext buttons here guys.\n\n529\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.660\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose next.\n\n530\n00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.940\nAnd now it's gonna say, hey, do you wanna\ngo through the installation process?\n\n531\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.730\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n532\n00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.600\nWe're gonna send this on over.\n\n533\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.730\nNow, I wanna jump over to the\ndemonstration here, because depending on\n\n534\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.650\nthese, when you do remote pushes here,\nit's probably already there.\n\n535\n00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.660\nYeah, the temp folder was\nactually It's usually empty.\n\n536\n00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.970\nBut it's not empty right now.\n\n537\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:44.630\nIf I kind of zoom in here, you'll see\nCLT for client and INST for install.\n\n538\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.560\nAnd if I navigated in here.\n\n539\n00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.350\nYou'll see that there's\nnot a lot there at first.\n\n540\n00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.310\nIt's got a lot of information that's\ngonna push out across the network and\n\n541\n00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.080\nstart installing.\n\n542\n00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.790\nIn fact if I back out of here you can see\nit's starting to go through that process.\n\n543\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:01.620\nNow one of the great things about this is\nit's completely transparent to the end\n\n544\n00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.930\nuser with the exception of\njust a couple of things.\n\n545\n00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.620\nOne of the things that you'll notice, you\nreally can't figure out, is the install,\n\n546\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.090\nother than knowing where those files are,\nis the install really happening?\n\n547\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.390\nSo, when I switch back over to my server,\n\n548\n00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.821\none of the things that I see here\nis that it says deployment status,\n\n549\n00:28:18.821 --> 00:28:23.435\nit's successful,\ncuz we're not at that computer.\n\n550\n00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:26.855\nI'm letting you guys see that\nwe're at that computer, but\n\n551\n00:28:26.855 --> 00:28:29.405\nthis computer could be\nin another building.\n\n552\n00:28:29.405 --> 00:28:31.270\nIt could be in another floor.\n\n553\n00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.500\nIt could be just down the office, right?\n\n554\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.140\nBut we don't actually know.\n\n555\n00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.310\nSo that's one of the good things.\n\n556\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:40.290\nIt's telling us, hey,\nthis client has been installed.\n\n557\n00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.850\nNow if we switch back over, this is\none of the things I want you to see,\n\n558\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.410\nnotice it says\nUpdate System Endpoint Protection.\n\n559\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.200\nSo we can see that the client has\nbeen installed and it's ready to go.\n\n560\n00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.990\nNow, there's a couple of other\nthings that we can do here.\n\n561\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.180\nOne of the things you have to do is\nyou have to restart the machine.\n\n562\n00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.660\nWell, how do we know that?\n\n563\n00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.190\nWe can look right on the client and\nwe can see that fact.\n\n564\n00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:08.590\nIf I was to go and launch System Endpoint\nProtection Administrative account.\n\n565\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.750\nI should get this warning\nright here that says,\n\n566\n00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.600\nyour computer needs to restart, right?\n\n567\n00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.180\nWe need to do that with a lot\nof installation software.\n\n568\n00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.310\nIt doesn't matter what it is, right?\n\n569\n00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.850\nYou need to perform a restart.\n\n570\n00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.410\nWell now I've got a problem, all right.\n\n571\n00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.670\nThat computer is two buildings over and\nI'm not sitting at it, so\n\n572\n00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.270\nam I gonna be able to restart it?\n\n573\n00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.250\nWell, you can manage that\nfrom the server side as well,\n\n574\n00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.150\nwhich is another great feature.\n\n575\n00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.150\nNow, to do this, let me go ahead and\n\n576\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.280\nwe're gonna do a refresh here cuz I\ndon't think, there it is, it showed up.\n\n577\n00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.210\nOh, and let me show you guys that,\nI kinda did that fast.\n\n578\n00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.130\nIf you don't see your client after\nyou get a successful deployment,\n\n579\n00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.880\nyou don't see your client, just hit\na refresh and you'll see that show up.\n\n580\n00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.550\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna right-click here and\n\n581\n00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.480\nlet me show you guys that too.\n\n582\n00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.540\nNotice that we've got a bunch of options.\n\n583\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.050\nAnd we'll be showing how,\nwhat some of these options do here, but\n\n584\n00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.470\nwhat I'm really looking at is\nthat restart client computer.\n\n585\n00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:05.220\nNow when we do this, when we,\nwe'll choose run command on computers,\n\n586\n00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.730\nwe're gonna ahead and\nwe're gonna restart the client computer.\n\n587\n00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.740\nNotice it's gonna ask me, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n588\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.990\nAnd i'm gonna go ahead say, well I\nclicked the button so my answer's yes.\n\n589\n00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.510\nAnd now it gives me a few\noptions to restart,\n\n590\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.180\non what I wanna do with the restart,\nright?\n\n591\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.510\nI might want to notify the end user.\n\n592\n00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.870\nI might wanna say hey, put some kind\nof message in here that says, hey,\n\n593\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.780\nif you're working on something right now,\n\n594\n00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.850\nyou need to ctrl + S, because if you\ndon't, you're gonna lose everything.\n\n595\n00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.510\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n596\n00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.360\nLet's say that this is in\nthe middle of the night,\n\n597\n00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.690\nwe're gonna deploy this on off hours.\n\n598\n00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.100\nI don't want a prompt,\nI want a hard restart, and\n\n599\n00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.790\nimmediately if a user's not logged in.\n\n600\n00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.960\nAnd we'll go ahead and just double check,\nmake sure that's set, we'll choose OK.\n\n601\n00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.540\nNow it tells me that\nthe command has been set.\n\n602\n00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.800\nNow I want you to notice,\nit doesn't happen right away.\n\n603\n00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.310\nBut the good thing is we can go back and\n\n604\n00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.710\nwe can look on our monitor portion here,\nall right.\n\n605\n00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.590\nNow the summary,\n\n606\n00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.590\nwe're gonna show you here,\neventually this risk distribution here.\n\n607\n00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.430\nBut what I really wanna\nsee is command status and\n\n608\n00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:18.210\nthat command status is the tab across\nthe top, when I hit the command status,\n\n609\n00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.490\nI can see, imagine this, all the commands\nthat I've set against clients.\n\n610\n00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.446\nNotice that I can see clients affected,\nI could see that it is.\n\n611\n00:31:26.446 --> 00:31:27.402\nWell now you can see it.\n\n612\n00:31:27.402 --> 00:31:30.290\nI could see that it's a restart, right?\n\n613\n00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.660\nThe other thing that I can see,\nis that it's affected one computer.\n\n614\n00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.550\nBut it doesn't say that it's\ngot a completion status, right.\n\n615\n00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.730\nIt just tells me that it's\njust affected the client.\n\n616\n00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.280\nWell, it takes a bit and\n\n617\n00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.520\nyou'll notice it's starting to restart,\nstarting to restart wow!\n\n618\n00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.042\nHey, very good,\nnothing like redundancy there and\n\n619\n00:31:48.042 --> 00:31:49.828\nit's gonna restart this computer.\n\n620\n00:31:49.828 --> 00:31:54.902\nNow once the computer restarts,\nwhat I should see over here,\n\n621\n00:31:54.902 --> 00:31:58.622\nback on the command\ncenter if I refresh this.\n\n622\n00:31:58.622 --> 00:32:01.806\nIn a bit,\nthat's gonna update to completion status.\n\n623\n00:32:01.806 --> 00:32:03.965\nNow, it hasn't finished the restart.\n\n624\n00:32:03.965 --> 00:32:06.990\nUpon the restart, it's gonna\ncommunicate back with the server, and\n\n625\n00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.412\nthen that's when we're gonna\nsee that it's updated.\n\n626\n00:32:09.412 --> 00:32:11.820\nWe've now got our client deployed,\n\n627\n00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.491\nand we should be ready to start\nmonitoring the status of our endpoints.\n\n628\n00:32:16.491 --> 00:32:20.251\n>> Yeah, it's really easy to get impatient\nwith these types of systems saying oh,\n\n629\n00:32:20.251 --> 00:32:22.644\nI've sent that restart,\nwhat's taking so long?\n\n630\n00:32:22.644 --> 00:32:24.525\nRemember, you're using remote management.\n\n631\n00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:28.048\nYou might be inside of a building where\neverybody's connected with a gig link, and\n\n632\n00:32:28.048 --> 00:32:29.823\nthat'll be probably a whole lot faster.\n\n633\n00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:34.912\nBut if you have things like VPN users,\nor you have maybe a satellite offices,\n\n634\n00:32:34.912 --> 00:32:38.686\nthey might not have the best\ninternet connection there.\n\n635\n00:32:38.686 --> 00:32:43.401\nIt’s just an easy place for them to do\nbusiness outside of your main building.\n\n636\n00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:44.223\nSo you're gonna have to wait.\n\n637\n00:32:44.223 --> 00:32:45.883\nYou're going to have to give it some time,\nbe there.\n\n638\n00:32:45.883 --> 00:32:51.583\nTrust me, I've waited my fair share of\ntime for these managers to do their job.\n\n639\n00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:55.554\nBut once that client actually does\nget restarted, just like Wes said,\n\n640\n00:32:55.554 --> 00:32:59.338\nthey're going to kick off a connection\nstatus back to the manager.\n\n641\n00:32:59.338 --> 00:33:01.219\nTheir gonna say, hey, I'm back, alive.\n\n642\n00:33:01.219 --> 00:33:02.078\nHere's my status.\n\n643\n00:33:02.078 --> 00:33:05.803\nHere's my report, and then it's gonna\nupload those numbers into the manager\n\n644\n00:33:05.803 --> 00:33:09.189\nitself, and while we're sitting\nthere at the station, we can say oh,\n\n645\n00:33:09.189 --> 00:33:11.748\nokay, now it's actually\nmaking a connection back.\n\n646\n00:33:11.748 --> 00:33:13.245\nSo, these things can take\na little bit of time.\n\n647\n00:33:13.245 --> 00:33:14.766\nYou just gotta be a little patient.\n\n648\n00:33:14.766 --> 00:33:19.190\n>> Yeah, and one of the things in\nthe background that you might see there,\n\n649\n00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.068\nbecause remember, servers used in Windows,\n\n650\n00:33:22.068 --> 00:33:25.114\nthey use the enhanced\nsecurity configuration.\n\n651\n00:33:25.114 --> 00:33:27.381\nSo you'll notice that when I\ntried to refresh the page,\n\n652\n00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:30.629\nit didn't wanna do the refresh, because\nthere's a Java plug in here, right?\n\n653\n00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:34.728\nServers are not gonna, by default,\nbe running Java through the web browser.\n\n654\n00:33:34.728 --> 00:33:37.027\nSo you can see that it\ndidn't like that at first.\n\n655\n00:33:37.027 --> 00:33:38.547\nThat's all that is.\n\n656\n00:33:38.547 --> 00:33:43.190\nAnd let's see one more time,\nand there we go, finally.\n\n657\n00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.048\nThe faster computer get,\nthe more impatient I get, right?\n\n658\n00:33:45.048 --> 00:33:47.739\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can see that it's completed,\n\n659\n00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:51.277\nand it has been received and\nit's completed and we're good to go.\n\n660\n00:33:51.277 --> 00:33:54.131\nSo now our clients,\nyou know from the client's side,\n\n661\n00:33:54.131 --> 00:33:58.227\nwe can verify that it has been installed,\nthat we're ready to monitor it, and\n\n662\n00:33:58.227 --> 00:34:02.095\nit'll start reporting back into our\ncentralized database there, Dan.\n\n663\n00:34:02.095 --> 00:34:06.311\n>> Awesome, I'm looking at our clock here,\nwe've run out of time basically, but\n\n664\n00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:09.971\nwe did get the manager deployed,\nand that started working very well.\n\n665\n00:34:09.971 --> 00:34:13.488\nWe also deployed a package to a client,\ngot that installed.\n\n666\n00:34:13.488 --> 00:34:14.487\nIt’s checking back in.\n\n667\n00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:16.916\nIt’s 100% greenlight status\n>> Very very cool.\n\n668\n00:34:16.916 --> 00:34:19.156\nThank you for\nthose demonstrations showing us.\n\n669\n00:34:19.156 --> 00:34:22.376\nIs there anything else we need to know\nabout this before we let our good\n\n670\n00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:22.995\nviewers go?\n\n671\n00:34:22.995 --> 00:34:27.203\n>> I would say the one last thing is with\nsemantic end point protection here guys,\n\n672\n00:34:27.203 --> 00:34:31.473\none of the things that I mentioned is that\nyou want to run that live update when you\n\n673\n00:34:31.473 --> 00:34:32.393\ndo the install.\n\n674\n00:34:32.393 --> 00:34:37.527\nThere is a host integrity policy,\nthat you will not be able to deploy to\n\n675\n00:34:37.527 --> 00:34:42.765\nyour endpoints until the live update runs,\nso that is one limitation.\n\n676\n00:34:42.765 --> 00:34:45.665\nObviously, we're gonna keep it up to date,\nbut\n\n677\n00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:49.787\nwhen you run that a nd you go in to\ncreate that HIP, you should be okay.\n\n678\n00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:52.352\nYou'll see that you can\ndeploy it out to your groups.\n\n679\n00:34:52.352 --> 00:34:54.151\nBut other than that, just keep it updated.\n\n680\n00:34:54.151 --> 00:34:56.508\nAlways run live update,\nand you should be good.\n\n681\n00:34:56.508 --> 00:34:57.916\n>> Awesome.\nWell Wes, thank you so much.\n\n682\n00:34:57.916 --> 00:35:00.874\nI really look forward to your upcoming\nepisodes on this very topic and\n\n683\n00:35:00.874 --> 00:35:02.303\nsee what you have in store for us.\n\n684\n00:35:02.303 --> 00:35:04.737\nAs for this episode, though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and shut her down.\n\n685\n00:35:04.737 --> 00:35:06.328\nThank you so much for watching!\n\n686\n00:35:06.328 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.520\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in this episode we're gonna\n\n4\n00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.730\ncontinue on with the antivirus anti\nmalware portions,going right back\n\n5\n00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.290\ninto that enterprise solution\nthat we looked at before.\n\n6\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.740\nAnd joining me yet again in the studio\nis you know him and you love him, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.470\nWes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.770\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.740\nHow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.120\n>> I'm doing great and as always,\nDan, it's good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.710\nAnd that's right,\n\n12\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.800\nwe're gonna be moving into more of\nthe Symantic Endpoint Protection, and\n\n13\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.380\nlooking at how we can manage\nour client workstations from\n\n14\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.470\na centralized location to\nthe Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager.\n\n15\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.590\nAnd as you probably already know by now in\nlooking at some of those earlier episodes,\n\n16\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.160\nit's a big departure from some of\nthe consumer grade deployments or\n\n17\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.520\ninstallations that we've looked at.\n\n18\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.960\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.880\nlet's check out the system Endpoint\nProtection Manager here on our server.\n\n20\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.550\nWe've got a couple of clients already\ninstalled, they're ready to go.\n\n21\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.820\nAnd what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is we're gonna dive right in and\n\n22\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.260\nwe're gonna do a little bit of monitoring.\n\n23\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.470\nOne of the great things about most\nof your Enterprise level software,\n\n24\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.730\nin fact this is the reason\nyou want to have it,\n\n25\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.760\nis the fact that you can keep an eye\non what's going on with the clients.\n\n26\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.910\nNow, every piece of software is gonna be\na little bit different on how they do it,\n\n27\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.260\nwhat kind of information they show.\n\n28\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.100\nIt can be very verbose, and it usually is,\ncuz you really wanna know the ins and\n\n29\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.640\nthe outs of your networks, and\nmore importantly the devices that\n\n30\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.640\nare connected to your networks and\ncommunicating.\n\n31\n00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.810\nSo one of the first\nthings we can look at is,\n\n32\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.260\nI'm just double-clicking on the client,\nI'll tell you what, rather than go so\n\n33\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.120\nfast on that,\nhere's our clients, all right.\n\n34\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.470\nAnd to see where this is,\nwe usually start out in the Dashboard.\n\n35\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530\nThat's that home button right there, and\n\n36\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.720\nyou can see down here along\nthe side we've got Clients.\n\n37\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.500\nSo when you pick Clients,\nit shows you all the clients and\n\n38\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.370\nbased on their groups,\nwhere they're located.\n\n39\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.480\nNow, once you do that just select\nany client that's in question, and\n\n40\n00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.820\nwhen you double-click on it,\n\n41\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.320\nyou can see the various information about\nthat client or the work station, itself.\n\n42\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.390\nSo when we look in here, we can see\nthe computer name, all the information,\n\n43\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.670\nperson that is logged in.\n\n44\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.210\nWe can also see the group.\n\n45\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.800\nKeep in mind this is contingent\n\n46\n00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.820\non the structure that you did\nwhen we made our groups, right.\n\n47\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.160\nA lot like Active Directory or\nLDAP-based groups, here, and\n\n48\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.690\nyou can see where it's located.\n\n49\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.152\nAnd you can see some of the basic\ninformation about this computer.\n\n50\n00:02:34.152 --> 00:02:39.141\nNothing really fancy here other\nthan the fact that maybe you\n\n51\n00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:43.740\nwanna keep track of what\nyour machine's hardware is.\n\n52\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.630\nAnd Dan, I really like this too,\n\n53\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.120\nreally cool information when you're\nmonitoring here, is the TPM device.\n\n54\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.470\nWe talk about trusted platform modules,\nand not every device.\n\n55\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.030\nA lot of the newer devices have this,\nbut not every device has that.\n\n56\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.830\nSo maybe even if you're thinking\nabout deploying other software\n\n57\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.440\nthat can help you with\nthe trusted platform modules and\n\n58\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.370\nthe hardware based security\nproducts that you have.\n\n59\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.050\nSo you can get a lot of\ngood information here.\n\n60\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.598\nI can see the networks\nthat the machine is on,\n\n61\n00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.685\nand basically like\nrunning your IP config or\n\n62\n00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:17.680\nifconfig on your machines without\nhaving to go over there and do that.\n\n63\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.720\nYou can see the DNS servers,\nthe WIN server.\n\n64\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.760\nNow, one of the great things I like\nabout this is DNS server, right?\n\n65\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.998\nThere's a lot of DNS attacks out there,\nright?\n\n66\n00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:26.830\nMaybe I wanna find out,\n\n67\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.550\nmaybe for other troubleshooting, I want\nto find out, well what's the DNS server?\n\n68\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.270\nI got half of my machines in the entire\nnetwork that can't communicate with other\n\n69\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.310\ncomputers and\nwe think it might be a name resolution.\n\n70\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.150\nNow, this isn't really\nabout name resolution, but\n\n71\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.850\nyou can see where this information's\ngonna start to benefit you,\n\n72\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.740\neven if you're not talking\nabout a security standpoint.\n\n73\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.350\nNow, the clients here.\n\n74\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.630\nKeep in mind when we talk about clients,\nit gets a little tricky here,\n\n75\n00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.605\nand most of you probably\nalready understand this that\n\n76\n00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:56.865\nnow we're talking about the agent\nthat's running on the machine, right.\n\n77\n00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:01.605\nAnd we can see, the virus definitions,\nwhen were they updated and\n\n78\n00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.145\nwe can see that they were updated today.\n\n79\n00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.205\nCurrent SONAR definitions, remember SONAR,\n\n80\n00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:10.085\nthat's that Symantec online\nnetwork advanced response.\n\n81\n00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:14.485\nIt's kind of like heuristics and\nreputation all built into one.\n\n82\n00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:18.860\nIntrusion Prevention System, its updates.\n\n83\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.490\nCurrent download protection,\nso a lot of information.\n\n84\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.700\nHealth integrity status.\n\n85\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.350\nNow, it's disabled here because I\nhaven't set a host integrity policy.\n\n86\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.620\nSo it's reporting the information back.\n\n87\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.520\nIt's disabled because I don't\nhave the policy in place.\n\n88\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.990\nAnd you can see the last time status\nchanged, so a lot of good information.\n\n89\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.950\nSo really good way there, Dan,\nif you wanna monitor your systems,\n\n90\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.470\nyou can reach out,\nfind any system that is in the database,\n\n91\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.160\nhave that information in front of you,\nand just be able to find out.\n\n92\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.370\nBecause again, think about it,\n\n93\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.480\nif you've got 5,000 computers it's very\neasy to forget, or maybe even not know,\n\n94\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.200\nwhat the hardware is, what the networks\nare, and what their client status is.\n\n95\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.840\n>> Yeah, what's really cool\nabout this interface is that\n\n96\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.190\nyou don't have to just use it for\nantivirus.\n\n97\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.030\nIt gives you so much information.\n\n98\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.120\nWhen I was deploying and using Symantec\nEndpoint Protection, I would use it for\n\n99\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.560\na lot of stuff because antivirus\ncleaning up was a big portion of my job,\n\n100\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.090\nbut I also did some network\nadministration, things like that.\n\n101\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.350\nI could easily help troubleshoot\nmachines by getting the information from\n\n102\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.080\nSymantec instead of asking my user, okay,\nlet's try to open up a command prompt.\n\n103\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.552\nOkay, I'm gonna give you this ipconfig,\n\n104\n00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:29.770\nit's I-P-C-O-N,\nlabel all that out for them.\n\n105\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.252\nI just pull all that information straight\nfrom Symantec's Endpoint Protection\n\n106\n00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:37.620\nManagerg Get that for myself, and\nthen start my troubleshooting process.\n\n107\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.740\nAnd then, of course, it helps me see,\n\n108\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.960\nlike Wes was saying,\nthe status of the antivirus system.\n\n109\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.340\nIt doesn't have updates applied,\nis it talking to the server correctly?\n\n110\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.380\nDo I have anything that\nmight be a red flag?\n\n111\n00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.840\nAnd it'll actually turn red if\nit's really in a critical state.\n\n112\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.890\nThat little green button that\nyou see on your screen there\n\n113\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.640\nwill turn either yellow or red, as well.\n\n114\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.302\nWith that being said, it is a great thing.\n\n115\n00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:05.735\nNow, Wes, the one thing that we do\nwanna start talking about now is we're\n\n116\n00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:10.457\nmonitoring and that's great, right,\nit obviously has it's benefits, but\n\n117\n00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:13.050\nwhat about interacting with our clients?\n\n118\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.840\n>> That's exactly, that's a great thing,\ntoo, I mean, because we're not\n\n119\n00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.875\njust looking at the, if you're just\ngathering information, well, that's great.\n\n120\n00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:22.380\nBut what if you gather\ninformation that tells you,\n\n121\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.090\nhey, this database is out of date,\nor this machine might be infected?\n\n122\n00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.390\nAnd that is one thing that we can do here.\n\n123\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.370\nAnd, again, most of it is fairly easy\nonce you know where you're looking.\n\n124\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.380\nNow, one of the things that we can\ndo here is any one of your devices.\n\n125\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.250\nIf you want to initiate some kind of scan,\nif you wanna update, let me go ahead and\n\n126\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.490\nswitch over to our other machine here and\nshow you something here real quick.\n\n127\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.450\nLaunch up the client side of this,\nall right.\n\n128\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.840\nIf I go into, let's say, View Logs, right,\n\n129\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.460\nand we're gonna do System Logs,\nI can initiate things like updates.\n\n130\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.990\nI can initiate things like scans,\nif I want, all from the server, itself.\n\n131\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.340\nAnd I can see some information\nhere about the local machine.\n\n132\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.570\nWell, what if I wanna run a scan?\n\n133\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.940\nWell, let's see if there's any scans\nhere on the client side first.\n\n134\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.520\nWe'll pull and see a scan log here.\n\n135\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.820\nNow, this scan, this Defwatch Quickscan?\n\n136\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.330\nGuys, that happens the moment\nyou install this, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.150\nI haven't initiated this.\n\n138\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.370\nThis is one that,\nthe moment you install, in fact,\n\n139\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.250\nif I was to switch over to the other\nmachine, you'd see a Defwatch QuickScan\n\n140\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.240\non it, too, because the moment\nyou install it, it runs a scan.\n\n141\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.680\nBut let's see if we can add\nanother scan to that log, and\n\n142\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.840\nfind out if we truly are able\nto push out one of those skins.\n\n143\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.412\nNow, this is something that's fairly easy,\ntoo, and\n\n144\n00:07:49.412 --> 00:07:52.053\nlet me kinda show you guys this\na little bit easier there.\n\n145\n00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:57.456\nAll right, so all I did, guys,\nis I clicked the appropriate machine,\n\n146\n00:07:57.456 --> 00:07:59.896\nright-click it, if you will.\n\n147\n00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.443\nYou notice run commands on your computer,\nand\n\n148\n00:08:02.443 --> 00:08:06.840\nthen you get this list of the tasks\nthat you can run against that computer.\n\n149\n00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.240\nNotice that we get\nthe ability to do a scan,\n\n150\n00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.860\nwe get the ability to do update content.\n\n151\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.990\nWe've already restarted the client.\n\n152\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.238\nRemember when you deploy the software for\nthe first time, it installs,\n\n153\n00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:17.310\nit requires a restart.\n\n154\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.980\nSo, we can do that as well.\n\n155\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.729\nThe one that I want here though\nis all the way at the top.\n\n156\n00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:23.700\nI want this Scan option.\n\n157\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.955\nNow, you do get a few options.\n\n158\n00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:30.260\nSo, if you right click on it,\nyou run the command and you choose scan.\n\n159\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.549\nAll right.\nIt's gonna say,\n\n160\n00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:34.350\nthis will run this command, are you sure?\n\n161\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.148\nAll right.\n\n162\n00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:38.950\nNow, we are sure, so\nI'll just say yes to that.\n\n163\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.627\nAnd we have a few options.\n\n164\n00:08:40.627 --> 00:08:45.740\nNow, depending on, do you have\nsomebody working at the machine?\n\n165\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.209\nIs it after hours?\n\n166\n00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:48.601\nIs it off peek hours?\n\n167\n00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:50.794\nHas everybody gone home for the day,\n\n168\n00:08:50.794 --> 00:08:53.918\nmight dictate which one of\nthese you're gonna run.\n\n169\n00:08:53.918 --> 00:08:59.828\nBecause anytime your machine is going to\nrun scans, understand it's CPU intensive.\n\n170\n00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:03.603\nSo, if you have somebody on that endpoint\nthat's running something like, I don't\n\n171\n00:09:03.603 --> 00:09:07.711\nknow, maybe they're in design and they're\nrunning something like Adobe's Photoshop.\n\n172\n00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.760\nThat can be really resource intensive.\n\n173\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.347\nIf you've got somebody that's\ndoing computer aided design,\n\n174\n00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:15.941\nrunning something like AutoCAD,\nthat takes a lot of power up.\n\n175\n00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:20.285\nSo, I might not wanna be running\nthese scans while the machines that\n\n176\n00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:22.508\nare in production are being used.\n\n177\n00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:26.680\nOr if that's the case, and I still think,\nyeah, I do wanna run a scan.\n\n178\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.671\nI might wanna run an active scan.\n\n179\n00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:31.829\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here,\njust, we'll run an active scan and\n\n180\n00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:33.491\nwe'll go ahead and run that.\n\n181\n00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:36.618\nNow, kind of like we did\nin the first part of this,\n\n182\n00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:39.520\nif you remember I ran the restart command,\nand\n\n183\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.560\nit tells you right here, it says it's\ngonna be sent to the client shortly.\n\n184\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.261\nAll right.\nThen it says, look at the command status.\n\n185\n00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:51.668\nNow, that's the monitoring portion\nof this endpoint protection manager.\n\n186\n00:09:51.668 --> 00:09:53.680\nWe'll go ahead and choose OK to that.\n\n187\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.140\nAnd then we're gonna go to monitors.\n\n188\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.450\nAnd then up at the top,\nwe've got Commands Status.\n\n189\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.960\nNow, you will see that we've\ngot an active scan running.\n\n190\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.898\nAnd like earlier,\nwhen we were doing the restart.\n\n191\n00:10:11.898 --> 00:10:13.998\nNotice it says, not received yet.\n\n192\n00:10:13.998 --> 00:10:18.826\nWe're not really sure, at least at\nthis point from the server side,\n\n193\n00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:21.252\nif our machine received the scan.\n\n194\n00:10:21.252 --> 00:10:25.977\nSo, let's go ahead and I tell yo what,\nlet's jump over to that machine and\n\n195\n00:10:25.977 --> 00:10:31.609\nwe're gonna launch up its local endpoint\nprotection, Symantec endpoint protection.\n\n196\n00:10:31.609 --> 00:10:35.480\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nview the logs like we did before.\n\n197\n00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.523\nNow, you should see one of\nthose defwatch quick scans,\n\n198\n00:10:38.523 --> 00:10:42.107\nbecause the moment I push this\nsoftware out it's gonna run that.\n\n199\n00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:47.228\nBut we now should see, if we go up\nto Virus and Spyware Protection,\n\n200\n00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:51.436\nwhat we should see here is\nthat when we choose View Log,\n\n201\n00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:54.098\nwe have scan, risk, and system.\n\n202\n00:10:54.098 --> 00:10:56.080\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose scan.\n\n203\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.569\nAnd one of the things that I can see right\nhere is that I have a manual scan and\n\n204\n00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:01.615\nthere's that defwatch click scan again.\n\n205\n00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:05.311\nAgain, that's one that starts\nthe moment you install the software.\n\n206\n00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.341\nBut notice I have an active scan.\n\n207\n00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:09.596\nNow, you gotta be careful\nwith the verbiage here.\n\n208\n00:11:09.596 --> 00:11:11.612\nWhat I mean is that it's in progress,\n\n209\n00:11:11.612 --> 00:11:14.958\nbecause an active scan is kind\nof like Symantec's Quick Scan.\n\n210\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.027\nThey call it active scan.\n\n211\n00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:17.856\nIt scans a really important area.\n\n212\n00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:21.477\nSo, what I mean when I say I have\nan active scan going on here,\n\n213\n00:11:21.477 --> 00:11:25.120\nI mean there's one in progress and\nyou can see that.\n\n214\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.356\nNow, that's a good way that you\ncan maintain your machines.\n\n215\n00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:33.778\nAnd I'll tell you what, let's switch\nover to the other machine here,\n\n216\n00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:35.851\ncoz we viewed it's logs as well.\n\n217\n00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:38.351\nAnd you'll remember, we'll just go\nahead and just do this one more time.\n\n218\n00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:41.980\nScan log,\nI don't have any other scans in here.\n\n219\n00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.601\nAnd it's in real time too,\nwhich is kinda cool.\n\n220\n00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:51.680\nAnd notice, it lets me know that the first\nscan was received by the computer.\n\n221\n00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.550\nSo, it did update fairly quickly here from\nthe management interface that is says,\n\n222\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.740\nyeah, the scan was received.\n\n223\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.900\nAnd it'll go through a process\nof once the scan's finished,\n\n224\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.550\nyou'll see this pie graph will update.\n\n225\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.620\nLet's go ahead and issue another scan out.\n\n226\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.170\nAll right.\nWe're just right-clicking,\n\n227\n00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.050\nfinding the appropriate\nclient that you wanna scan.\n\n228\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.680\nAnd we'll do the scan again.\n\n229\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.012\nAnd we'll choose OK.\n\n230\n00:12:16.012 --> 00:12:19.270\nAnd that one should show up in\nour command status as well.\n\n231\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.330\nAnd sure enough, it does.\n\n232\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.300\nNow, if we switch back over\nto this machine here, and\n\n233\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.961\nwe'll view our logs one more time.\n\n234\n00:12:27.961 --> 00:12:31.860\nMight take a second to show up there.\n\n235\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.215\nGive it just a moment here.\n\n236\n00:12:35.215 --> 00:12:35.830\nAnd I'll tell you what.\n\n237\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.030\nWe'll see how this one's doing.\n\n238\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.520\nAnd it's still in progress.\n\n239\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.837\nKeep in mind that when you do run\nthe scan, if you push the scan out,\n\n240\n00:12:44.837 --> 00:12:46.577\nit might take a bit to up date here.\n\n241\n00:12:46.577 --> 00:12:47.598\nShouldn't take too long.\n\n242\n00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:48.876\nThere we go.\n\n243\n00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:50.385\nAnd sure enough, the scan's in place.\n\n244\n00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:53.806\nSo, that quick from\na centralized location.\n\n245\n00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:57.702\nWhat if these machines were in\ntwo different buildings and\n\n246\n00:12:57.702 --> 00:12:59.936\nyou wanna be able to manage them?\n\n247\n00:12:59.936 --> 00:13:03.467\nAnd you certainly don't wanna have to take\nthe elevator, go to the other building and\n\n248\n00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:05.096\ndo all that from the computer locally.\n\n249\n00:13:05.096 --> 00:13:07.116\nNotice that it was just very easy.\n\n250\n00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:08.637\nNot too bad.\n\n251\n00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:10.936\nOne click, send it to one machine.\n\n252\n00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:13.375\nAnother click sends it\nto the other machine.\n\n253\n00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:16.776\nThen, now we've got two machines that\nare running their active scans in\n\n254\n00:13:16.776 --> 00:13:19.241\nthe background, and\nhopefully things are secure.\n\n255\n00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:21.950\nOr if not, hopefully they're\ngetting a little more secure.\n\n256\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.431\n>> Yeah, hopefully that's exactly right.\n\n257\n00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:26.401\nYou don't wanna find any bad guys\nlurking on anybody's machines.\n\n258\n00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:30.590\nAnd that's all reason we deploy this type\nof software is, in case that does happen,\n\n259\n00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.015\nwell, we've got some\nactions that we can take.\n\n260\n00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:37.001\nAnd the software should find those\nthings and actually kill those things.\n\n261\n00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:41.231\nAnd that kind of actually brings\nus onto real life scenario.\n\n262\n00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.326\nOkay.\nIt's fine and\n\n263\n00:13:42.326 --> 00:13:46.060\ndandy that I can run an active scan on\na computer that's never done anything,\n\n264\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.560\nit's hardly even touched the internet.\n\n265\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.550\nBut what about that end point that\nis being used everyday by a person?\n\n266\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.625\nAnd they're going to websites.\n\n267\n00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:54.379\nAnd they're downloading stuff.\n\n268\n00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:55.506\nAnd they're getting email.\n\n269\n00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:59.306\nAnd they're using it as an interactive\nportal to the outside wild,\n\n270\n00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:01.381\nwild west that we call the internet.\n\n271\n00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:03.485\nThat's where the real danger comes in.\n\n272\n00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:07.485\nAnd you're gonna actually show\nus how we can work with this.\n\n273\n00:14:07.485 --> 00:14:10.792\nWe're gonna infect a computer\n[CROSSTALK] and fingers crossed.\n\n274\n00:14:10.792 --> 00:14:12.348\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:14:12.348 --> 00:14:12.929\n>> Everything works.\n\n276\n00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:13.973\n>> We hope everything works, yeah.\n\n277\n00:14:13.973 --> 00:14:14.485\n>> That's right.\n\n278\n00:14:14.485 --> 00:14:16.695\n>> And you have to be careful on this.\n\n279\n00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:19.820\nI have to just warn you\nguys ahead of time.\n\n280\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.029\nI'm gonna do this a couple different ways.\n\n281\n00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:24.551\nI'm gonna do it with an industry wide\nstandard out there called the iClarified.\n\n282\n00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:28.059\nAll right.\nIt's just a string of data that is kept in\n\n283\n00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:31.907\na good majority of the modern\nantivirus software.\n\n284\n00:14:31.907 --> 00:14:36.543\nIt's not a virus itself, it's just\na little hash value that says if you find\n\n285\n00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:40.836\nthis is a file, flag it as a virus and\nremediate it, clean it right up.\n\n286\n00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:43.990\nAnd that let's you know that\nthe realtime protection is going.\n\n287\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.108\nThat's not a virus.\n\n288\n00:14:45.108 --> 00:14:47.931\nHowever, we do have\na couple rattlesnakes here.\n\n289\n00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:49.278\nI have to let you know, be careful.\n\n290\n00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:54.326\nYou have to be willing and understand that\nif you are going to unleash one of these,\n\n291\n00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:57.341\nyou have to be able to\nremediate it very quickly.\n\n292\n00:14:57.341 --> 00:15:02.311\nSo, be careful with this next point if\nyou do this in your own demonstration or\n\n293\n00:15:02.311 --> 00:15:04.075\ntesting out the software.\n\n294\n00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:05.483\nSo, we're gonna go ahead.\n\n295\n00:15:05.483 --> 00:15:09.206\nAnd one of the things I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n296\n00:15:09.206 --> 00:15:12.200\ninfect this machine here real quick.\n\n297\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.225\nAnd we'll see if it remediates.\n\n298\n00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:20.238\nNow, if it does remediate, you can\nsee it's already in the background.\n\n299\n00:15:20.238 --> 00:15:21.925\nIt says, I can't find the path.\n\n300\n00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:23.760\nWindows is saying,\nI don't know where that file is.\n\n301\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.177\nWell, what do you mean here?\n\n302\n00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:27.551\nIt couldn't extract the file.\n\n303\n00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:32.150\nIt couldn't do anything because I can see\nin the background, sure enough right away,\n\n304\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.611\nand I don't wanna go out\nto the internet here.\n\n305\n00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:39.950\nBut right away it let me know that,\nhey, there is a virus on this machine.\n\n306\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.070\nAnd it found it.\n\n307\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.409\nIt found that it was trying\nto make a registry entry.\n\n308\n00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.500\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.237\nAnd it gives you the information,\ngives you a lot of the metadata and\n\n310\n00:15:48.237 --> 00:15:49.590\nit says it already cleaned it up.\n\n311\n00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.755\nSo, you can see,\nit works fairly fast at what it's doing.\n\n312\n00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:55.115\nBut let's not stop there.\n\n313\n00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:58.821\nLet's go over to the other machine and\nlet's really.\n\n314\n00:15:58.821 --> 00:15:59.370\nSee if we.\n\n315\n00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.264\nOops Endpoint has found a problem here.\n\n316\n00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:03.836\nSo that's great here.\n\n317\n00:16:03.836 --> 00:16:05.730\nLet's go ahead and cancel that.\n\n318\n00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.900\nAnd we're gonna find out\nif it shuts it down,\n\n319\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.010\nif the real time protection is\nstill running in the background.\n\n320\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.510\nSo why not?\n\n321\n00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.080\nWe're really gonna test\nthis software out here.\n\n322\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.550\nAnd so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n323\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.830\nOh, right away, that caught it.\n\n324\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.370\nSo, the good thing was it was just the UI\n\n325\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.400\nthat kinda had a little problem\nthere when I closed it down.\n\n326\n00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.340\nAnd notice it did the same\nthing right away.\n\n327\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.930\nSo that's actually kind of a,\nit's a great thing,\n\n328\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.690\nbut I'm actually kind of impressed\nby that, that the UI said I'm sorry,\n\n329\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.550\nI'm gonna take a vacation but the real\ntime protection in the background didn't.\n\n330\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.090\nSo a couple different\nbackdoor trojans here.\n\n331\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.920\nAnd it found this one too.\n\n332\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.500\n>> So that real time protection is\nactually, it's watching RAM and\n\n333\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.760\nseeing what's getting loaded\nup into the RAM as it happens.\n\n334\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.690\nSo that's how it was able\nto immediately say hey.\n\n335\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.920\nI know this guy and he is not welcome to\nthis party whatsoever, and kill it out.\n\n336\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.680\n>> That's exactly right, Dan.\n\n337\n00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.430\nTo add to that here,\nit's also in fact this one, there we go,\n\n338\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.920\nthis one over here is,\nyou might see it's trying to make.\n\n339\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.440\nIt's trying to make a direct modification\n\n340\n00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.390\nto the local machine\nsubtree in the registry.\n\n341\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.830\nNow, if you guys aren't\nfamiliar with that,\n\n342\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.290\nlet's take some of the jargon out of it.\n\n343\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.590\nThat's your hardware configuration, right?\n\n344\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.800\nThat's where the data base is stored\nwhen your operating system loads.\n\n345\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.750\nIt says,\nhey I want you to load these drivers.\n\n346\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.000\nI want you to configure the real\ntime environment this way.\n\n347\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.530\nSo this virus was trying\nto make a modification\n\n348\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.900\ndown at the lowest levels\nof the operating system and\n\n349\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.840\nreally modify the hardware configuration,\nthat database that it stores.\n\n350\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.430\nNow this is all fine and dandy,\nyou know, and it's great, but\n\n351\n00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.460\nwhat does it do for us if we're\nnot sitting at the machine itself?\n\n352\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.420\nRight, I'm sitting at this machine,\nI can tell something's happened, but\n\n353\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.930\nI know it's happening.\n\n354\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.520\nYou know, this doesn't always happen.\n\n355\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.440\nWhat happens if I'm the user and\nthe user goes I don't know what I did.\n\n356\n00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.160\nSomething's wrong, and\nwe get a help desk ticket, right?\n\n357\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.430\nAnd I know, we've talked Daniel I\nknow you've had those before.\n\n358\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.290\nThe end user goes,\nI don't know what's going on, but\n\n359\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.730\nnow I've got something going on, it's\nsaying that there's a virus on my machine.\n\n360\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.970\nSo let's go ahead and close this out.\n\n361\n00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:20.640\nAnd switch back over to\nthe Endpoint Protection Manager here.\n\n362\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.850\nWhich, this is nice to see too,\nnotice it's changed.\n\n363\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.780\nNot only has it received, it's letting\nus know right that it's in progress and\n\n364\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.550\nyou guys can read that there.\n\n365\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.510\nNow, the next thing that we want\nto do is we want to go back.\n\n366\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.580\nWe've dealt a lot with\nthe Command Status location.\n\n367\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.680\nWe want to get down here to the summary.\n\n368\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.290\nThe summary is what's going to show\nus a little bit more information and\n\n369\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.300\nrisk distribution.\n\n370\n00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.840\nSure enough Dan,\nit's already updated our database.\n\n371\n00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.038\nAnd it's let us know that we've got some\nissues that we've gotta be aware of.\n\n372\n00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:59.370\nAnd this might be the point\nwhere maybe you're calling\n\n373\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.840\nthe end point rather than them calling\nyou and saying, hey, what's going on?\n\n374\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.270\nWhere are you going?\n\n375\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:09.580\nHow did you get these, and it lays it out\nfor you, tells you exactly what these,\n\n376\n00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.170\noops and I don't want to connect\noutbound here because it takes a while.\n\n377\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.530\nNo that's okay Internet Explorer,\nwe were just kidding.\n\n378\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.420\nAlright, but\nit'll show you the information,\n\n379\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:25.530\ngives you a report of what's found, and\nlet's you know the auto protect was on.\n\n380\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.240\nAnother cool thing is, if I want to know.\n\n381\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.980\nWho was logged in right.\n\n382\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.180\nI wanna find out not only\nwhat machine was it, but\n\n383\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.440\nwho was logged in at that time, right?\n\n384\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.339\nIs it part of my marketing team,\nis it part of staff?\n\n385\n00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:43.470\nI can see that, and\nthat's a great thing to have too.\n\n386\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.650\nThe other thing that we\ncan do too is run reports.\n\n387\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.410\nNotice I have this report and\nyou got some criteria that you set up.\n\n388\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.430\nYou gotta schedule\nthe reports that happen.\n\n389\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.650\nYou guys understand, on a scheduled basis.\n\n390\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.210\nBut these are quick gens.\n\n391\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.280\nQuick generated reports.\n\n392\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.270\nSo I'll go ahead and,\nlet's see if we create a report of it.\n\n393\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.420\nOh, it's not saying it!\n\n394\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.380\nWell, apparently we don't have\nany infected computers, and\n\n395\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.560\nthat's always a good report.\n\n396\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.580\n[LAUGH] No information is good\ninformation on that one, so let's see,\n\n397\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.500\nthere should be a threats,\nRisk Detection Count.\n\n398\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.030\nI think that's it.\n\n399\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.880\nAnd by domain, we'll do by computer.\n\n400\n00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.400\nLet's see if we get any, there we go.\n\n401\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.310\nSo really, basically what it's doing is,\nit's allowing me to take the information\n\n402\n00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.410\nthat's in the real time monitoring\nsection, this summary that we looked at,\n\n403\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.160\nyou can now export that\ninformation out if you need to.\n\n404\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.020\nAnd save it if you have, maybe for\ntrending analysis, you wanna find out what\n\n405\n00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.100\nkind of viruses people are getting, maybe\nyou can see some kind of trend behind it.\n\n406\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.230\nSo all real good information,\nyou can go back if you need to.\n\n407\n00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.780\nAnd when you get this information,\nthe first thing I would say, Dan,\n\n408\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.660\nthat I would probably doing is pushing\nout scans to the devices that I've\n\n409\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.225\nseen in the reports or the monitors\nhere I could see where it was detected.\n\n410\n00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:03.135\nI could see this information\nyou know Win 7 install and\n\n411\n00:21:03.135 --> 00:21:08.535\nI would probably if it was me go back\nover to my clients and I would say yeah\n\n412\n00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:14.085\nwe need to go ahead and maybe do\nan update content and run a scan, right?\n\n413\n00:21:14.085 --> 00:21:16.405\nWe're gonna want to reach\nout to Semantic and\n\n414\n00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:18.525\npull down any new definitions that we can.\n\n415\n00:21:18.525 --> 00:21:22.620\nAnd then force the scan to run again\njust to make sure that in the end,\n\n416\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.870\nwe know that the endpoint\nitself is protected.\n\n417\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.530\n>> Yeah, I would actually go ahead and\nsay, that's the best way to go.\n\n418\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.650\nAlways, before you run a scan,\ndo that update to content.\n\n419\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.050\nThat way, you make sure that\nyou always have the latest and\n\n420\n00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.040\ngreatest in their virus definitions and\nheuristics and\n\n421\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.550\nthings that they have available, to make\nsure that something didn't just slide in,\n\n422\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.930\nbecause it's so new that you just\nhadn't updated your definitions yet,\n\n423\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.100\nso I would say always run that\nupdate content and then scan.\n\n424\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.610\nTakes a little bit longer but\nit's worth it.\n\n425\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.580\n>> Yeah and\none of the last things I might mention\n\n426\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.770\n>> And it's something that,\n\n427\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.890\nI didn't show you in the first part.\n\n428\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.510\nI do wanna kinda show you guys\nthis as well is policies here.\n\n429\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.430\nWhen we create policies,\nyou can create and\n\n430\n00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:11.050\ndictate how scans are gonna run.\n\n431\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.900\nIs auto protect gonna be on?\n\n432\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.110\nWhat is SONAR gonna do?\n\n433\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.710\nAgain, that's the Symantec\nOnline Network Advance Response.\n\n434\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.260\nAnd you can see it can do high-risk,\nlow-risk detection,\n\n435\n00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.940\nworks on a reputationed database,\nif you will.\n\n436\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.530\nWe also have max settings and\nLinux settings here.\n\n437\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:33.551\nAnd you can go down, you can configure\nall these individually, like for instance\n\n438\n00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:38.530\nit's got ELAM driver here, acronym there,\nearly launch anti malware driver.\n\n439\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:44.452\nThis is something that's specific to\nWindows, and I can tell create a policy\n\n440\n00:22:44.452 --> 00:22:50.279\nthat says yes I do want you to enable\nthat through Semantic and what the ELAM,\n\n441\n00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:55.785\nthe Early Launch Anti Malware driver\ndoes is one of the problems with.\n\n442\n00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:59.975\nWell it can be a potential problem for\nany malware software is root kits,\n\n443\n00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:04.275\nthey like to, you know, slip themselves in\nunder the radar, no pun intended there.\n\n444\n00:23:04.275 --> 00:23:08.620\nAnd they try to launch before\nthe malware itself even comes online.\n\n445\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.370\nWell I could turn this on, I could tell\nit that it's gonna turn it on, and\n\n446\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.890\nwhat it does, is it will, it'll give\nSymantec a way to protect itself.\n\n447\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.980\nAnd also look at things like\nyour system drivers too,\n\n448\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.260\nmaking sure that there's no,\nthat there isn't any extra data in there,\n\n449\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.990\nbecause if people like Microsoft are going\nto keep things like hash values,\n\n450\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.520\nmessage digests of the system\ndrivers that are there.\n\n451\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.230\nIf it scans it and\nit finds a different check sum\n\n452\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.430\nthen what it's expecting it\nknows that there's a problem and\n\n453\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.980\nit takes action very early\non in the startup process.\n\n454\n00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.250\nSo all real good information you can.\n\n455\n00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.720\nYou could set your policies here and\nthen you can deploy them out.\n\n456\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.760\nAnd it is one thing that I\ndid want to mention there.\n\n457\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.930\nBut all really good stuff Dan.\n\n458\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.650\nYou know you could see that let's see,\nget back over here.\n\n459\n00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.530\nWe can look at the client\nside one more time and\n\n460\n00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.550\njust kind of take a look at the log.\n\n461\n00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.870\nNotice it says, computers protected,\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n462\n00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.620\nWe can view the quarantine list.\n\n463\n00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.430\nNotice it says that this is infected.\n\n464\n00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.580\nWe can delete these from here.\n\n465\n00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.480\nKeep in mind that if you are doing\nthis and it does find information,\n\n466\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.680\nyou're gonna wanna make\nsure that it cleans it.\n\n467\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.410\nIt does an eradicator, if you will,\nremediate the client there and making\n\n468\n00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.160\nsure that your networks are a little\nhopefully, a little bit more secure.\n\n469\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.240\nSo, great stuff there.\n\n470\n00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.250\nIt definitely did it's job.\n\n471\n00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.300\nI did like the fact that\nwhen the UI crashed,\n\n472\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.700\nthe real time protection in\nthe background didn't crash,\n\n473\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.560\nso it's definitely making its money,\nI can tell you that.\n\n474\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.460\n>> Yeah that's for sure.\n\n475\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.130\nThese Enterprise solutions\nare built like tanks.\n\n476\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.840\nI've worked with quite a few of them.\n\n477\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.370\nEvery one of them have\ntheir little quirks and\n\n478\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.460\nways that you gotta get used to them and\nthe way they do things.\n\n479\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.960\nBut they're all very,\nvery good at their job.\n\n480\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.030\nYou just have to figure out\nhow to make them do exactly\n\n481\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.720\nwhat you need them to do for\nyour environment.\n\n482\n00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.150\nWes, you've done a great job showing us\nhow to work with the management software\n\n483\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.050\nto do things like kickoff an antivirus,\noh imagine that.\n\n484\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.720\nMonitor our clients,\nmake sure they're running correctly.\n\n485\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.350\nThis is going to be\nthe bulk of what you do\n\n486\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.180\nas a sys admin that is in\ncharge of an anti virus system.\n\n487\n00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.630\nYou're going to be monitoring computers,\ncalling end users going, hey,\n\n488\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.910\ndid you get a little alert today?\n\n489\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.370\nAnd you did not call the help desk and\nlet us know that was going on.\n\n490\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.920\nYou will be able to see all of that stuff.\n\n491\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.940\nInteract with them,\n\n492\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.758\nget computers make sure they are clean and\nwhen a problem does arise.\n\n493\n00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:29.880\nWes, any parting words for\nour viewers before we go?\n\n494\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.860\n>> No, just like we said,\n\n495\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.320\nin letting you know at the end\nof the last part there, guys.\n\n496\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.150\nJust make sure that if you're\ngonna install it, you update it.\n\n497\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.840\nBecause there is no point installing\nsoftware that has definitions from 1992.\n\n498\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.360\nJust kidding.\n\n499\n00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.010\nBut if you install the software.\n\n500\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.590\n>> Make sure that you're monitoring it,\nmake sure that you're checking the logs\n\n501\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.470\nand make sure that you're pushing out\nthese scans at the end points because you\n\n502\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.390\nwant to keep your system safe,\nespecially with your businesses.\n\n503\n00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.030\nCorporate data is expensive,\ntime is money and if you can go ahead and\n\n504\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.320\njust take the time now, you're going\nto save yourself time and money later.\n\n505\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.380\nAwesome.\n>> Thank you so much for\n\n506\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.630\nshowing us how this works.\n\n507\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.310\nA lot of you out there,\nI know this is a very interesting topic.\n\n508\n00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.640\nI love it, it's a lot of fun.\n\n509\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.520\nHopefully you found it\nentertaining as well.\n\n510\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.730\nAs for the show though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n511\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.600\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n512\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.029\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan,\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n513\n00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:23.550\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.536\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're gonna continue on\n\n4\n00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:26.067\nthat track of anti-virus and anti-malware,\nspecifically moving into more of\n\n5\n00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.870\na corporate, that higher level of solution\nthat we might have available for us.\n\n6\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.090\nAnd one of our SMEs joining us today is\nnone other than my good friend, my friend,\n\n7\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.830\nyou know him, you love him.\n\n8\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.340\nHis name is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.400\nWesley, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.120\nHow you doing today?\n\n11\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.970\n>> I'm doing great, Dan.\n\n12\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.200\nAnd as always,\nit's good to be here at the ITProTV stage.\n\n13\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.613\nAnd that's right,\nwe're going to be moving along today.\n\n14\n00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:50.076\nAnd one of the products that we're gonna\nbe talking about today is Kaspersky,\n\n15\n00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:52.050\nthe Kaspersky Security Center.\n\n16\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.880\nAnd, tell you what, let's go ahead.\n\n17\n00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.980\nLet's not waste any time,\nlet's jump right in here and\n\n18\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.180\nwe'll show you what it's about.\n\n19\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.727\nNow, as we move through this\nenterprise level anti-malware,\n\n20\n00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:07.530\nanti-virus products, keep in mind that\none of the things that differentiates\n\n21\n00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.460\nthis from some of the consumer-grade\nproducts that we've talked about,\n\n22\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.990\nis that centralized administration,\ncentralized management.\n\n23\n00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.200\nAnd not only that, the scalability.\n\n24\n00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.350\nScaling up to 100 computers, 1,000\ncomputers, 5,000 computers and beyond.\n\n25\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.820\nNow in some of the consumer\ngrade software,\n\n26\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.220\nit might give you the ability to control\nabout a handful or so of computers.\n\n27\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.810\nMaybe one or two of your mobile devices.\n\n28\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.930\nBut outside of that,\n\n29\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.540\nit's not really gonna help you too\nmuch in these large environments and\n\n30\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.340\nthat's why we need something like the\nKaspersky Security Ccenter to help us out\n\n31\n00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.370\nwhen we need to go more\ncorporate in our endeavors.\n\n32\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.900\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n33\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.300\nI've already downloaded the software here.\n\n34\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.462\nNow, when you download the software\njust remember go to the Kaspersky site.\n\n35\n00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:51.965\nYou can usually a lot of time\nyou can find trial software, so\n\n36\n00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:55.069\nif you're not sure if you want to\ndeploy this in your environment, well,\n\n37\n00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.240\ntry it out for a little bit.\n\n38\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.560\nThat's what we're doing here and\nit's got a fairly easy install,\n\n39\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.680\npretty intuitive wizard.\n\n40\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.565\nLet's go ahead and\nstart to walk you through that.\n\n41\n00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:05.280\n>> Little try before you buy kinda thing?\n\n42\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.780\n>> That's right.\nAnd you don't have to commit a lot of\n\n43\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.540\nextra dollars to something\nthat you're not sure well,\n\n44\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.730\nif it's gonna give you\nthe features that you want.\n\n45\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.730\nOne of the first things that you're gonna\nsee here is, it's just a small executable.\n\n46\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.550\nStill needs to go through the extraction\nprocess, so right here the first thing\n\n47\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.880\nthat we do is we install the Kaspersky\nCenter Administration Server.\n\n48\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.312\nNow that's gonna be the centralized\nmanagement platform for\n\n49\n00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.362\nthis entire anti-virus software.\n\n50\n00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.739\nSo lets go ahead and do that, and\n\n51\n00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.106\nyou'll see that it goes through the\nextraction process, and as it does this,\n\n52\n00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:42.490\nit starts unpacking all of those files\ngetting us ready for our installation.\n\n53\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.910\nNow the first thing that you'll see here\n\n54\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.690\nis going to be just a really\nbasic welcome message here.\n\n55\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.750\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ngo through this a little bit more.\n\n56\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.420\nYou'll see that we have the end\nuser license agreement here and\n\n57\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.470\nyou're gonna have to accept the terms\nof that license agreement before you're\n\n58\n00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.450\ngonna be able to move on.\n\n59\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.210\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n60\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.670\n>> Those lawyers, they get us every time.\n\n61\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.700\n>> That's right,\nthey've got to have their say in stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.610\nNow depending on what kind\nof installation you want,\n\n63\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.197\nit's really gonna tell you which\nselection you'll choose here.\n\n64\n00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:18.790\nIf you are just starting out with this, I\nwould recommend the typical installation.\n\n65\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.370\nIf you already know that you\nhave 1,000 computers and\n\n66\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.620\nbeyond, 5,000 and beyond, you're\nprobably gonna wanna go to the custom.\n\n67\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.090\nBecause the custom solution\nis when you need to\n\n68\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.900\nscale up a lot of information\nthat you're gonna be collecting.\n\n69\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.470\nSee, the typical installation's\ngonna have an internal database.\n\n70\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.230\nAnd you don't have to configure it.\n\n71\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.710\nEvery time the web interface\nstarts up it connects to this\n\n72\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.200\nsame server automatically.\n\n73\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.340\nBut when you have a lot of computers,\n\n74\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.120\nyou're gonna have a lot of data\nthat's gonna be reported back, and\n\n75\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.200\nit'll be important to probably have\na database submit, not probably,\n\n76\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.540\nyou will have to have a database with a\ncomputer that's got a lot of power on it.\n\n77\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.300\nBut we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe'll do the typical installation here.\n\n78\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.202\nAnd here's where they'll tell you,\n\n79\n00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:04.235\nif I was to select one of these\nmore than 5000 computers,\n\n80\n00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:08.040\nit's gonna tell you that you really\ndon't want the typical installation,\n\n81\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.382\nbecause you're gonna want something like\nmaybe Microsoft Sequel Server, or MySQL to\n\n82\n00:04:12.382 --> 00:04:16.810\npoint this installation to after you're\ndone installing the administration server.\n\n83\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.520\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n84\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.900\nAnd we're gonna start the installation.\n\n85\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.236\nNow, one of the things to keep in mind and\nI want you guys to know this,\n\n86\n00:04:26.236 --> 00:04:31.947\nas this is installing here,\nit does require the .net 3.5 framework.\n\n87\n00:04:31.947 --> 00:04:35.364\nNow I went ahead and already turned that\nfeature on, but if you haven't seen that\n\n88\n00:04:35.364 --> 00:04:38.290\nbefore,, let me just take a second\nto show you where you can do that.\n\n89\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.780\nYou just go to Program, Programs and\nFeatures, and then, right\n\n90\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.290\nhere is where we get the ability to turn\non or off a feature inside of Windows.\n\n91\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.920\nAnd this works on\nthe client by the way too.\n\n92\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.070\nAnd when we get in here, you're going\nto see that I've gone ahead and\n\n93\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.580\nI've already installed it.\n\n94\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.915\nIn fact,\nyou can't really see it right there.\n\n95\n00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:58.481\nBut, there we go.\n\n96\n00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:05.540\nSo from a Server Manager, once it does its\ncollection of data, we'll go to Features.\n\n97\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.870\nAnd you can see it right here and\nthat we've already added that.\n\n98\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.920\nThat is a prerequisite.\n\n99\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.435\nIf you don't have that installed,\n\n100\n00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:14.067\nKaspersky's not even gonna let\nyou start the installation.\n\n101\n00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:17.109\nSo just keep that in mind cuz it is\nsomething that's gonna be handy.\n\n102\n00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:20.266\nNow this installation takes a while.\n\n103\n00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:21.567\nIt could take a few.\n\n104\n00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:24.225\nAnd you'll see some of the things that\nit's gonna install in the background.\n\n105\n00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:28.040\nIt's gonna install your\nMS SQL Server there, MSXML and\n\n106\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.463\nthen it's gonna go through\nthe main components.\n\n107\n00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.947\nBut the good thing is we've\nalready got one here ready for\n\n108\n00:05:33.947 --> 00:05:36.330\nyou that it's already in\nit's post-installation,\n\n109\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.386\nit's gone through that process,\nit's got everything installed and\n\n110\n00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:42.413\nnow what we get to do, is just launch\nup the management console here.\n\n111\n00:05:42.413 --> 00:05:47.165\n>> Now Wes, we looked at Symantec,\nwhat was it, Endpoint Protection Manager,\n\n112\n00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:50.900\nthat basically so\nfar it's looking very similar to that.\n\n113\n00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.390\nIs there a real difference\nin these two products,\n\n114\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.510\nor any enterprise level\nanti-virus solution?\n\n115\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.510\nOr are they just basically different\npackaging on the same type of product?\n\n116\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.120\n>> It really is.\n\n117\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.300\nSome of them do have,\na little bit different bells and\n\n118\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.190\nwhistles, like when we were talking\nabout Symantec, we talked about SONAR,\n\n119\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.940\nthe Symantec Online Network\nAdvance Response technology,\n\n120\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.000\nwhich is a heuristics and\nreputation database.\n\n121\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.060\nAnd you'll see a lot of these technologies\nwhen you start with the installation.\n\n122\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.080\nA lot of them have very close to the same\nfeatures, they might just label it or\n\n123\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.370\nbrand it just something\nslightly different here.\n\n124\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.480\n>> Nike versus Reebok.\n\n125\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.310\n>> That's right, you know when it comes\ndown to it they're both good tennis shoes,\n\n126\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.520\nit just depends on how much money you want\nto spend or whatever your flavor might be.\n\n127\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.100\nNow when you first start to\nconfigure the administration server,\n\n128\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.400\nit's gonna have to connect to it.\n\n129\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.020\nAnd let me tell you one thing,\ngive you just a piece of advice,\n\n130\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.460\nif you turn your server on and\nlet's say you're going through a reboot,\n\n131\n00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.010\nit takes a little bit for\nit to connect to the database.\n\n132\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.610\nSo if it connects to the database or\nit tries to connect to the database and\n\n133\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.310\nit gives you an error, just wait a second\nfor the database to come online, and\n\n134\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.520\nthen relaunch\nthe Kaspersky Security Center here.\n\n135\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.600\nNow this is our quick-start wizard and\nwith our quick-start wizard,\n\n136\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.810\nwe get the ability here on whether\nwe want to add an activation key.\n\n137\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.550\nNow I don't have an activation key\nhere because I'm in a trial or\n\n138\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.220\na subscription based service.\n\n139\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.828\nIf you already have your activation key,\nlet's say you've gone through the process,\n\n140\n00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:22.187\nyou've already tried it out, you say hey\nKaspersky Security Center, that's for\n\n141\n00:07:22.187 --> 00:07:26.130\nmy company and I, then you can go ahead\nand put whatever key you might have.\n\n142\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.159\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay add the key later,\n\n143\n00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.000\nnow the next thing that we have is\nsending statistical information.\n\n144\n00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.775\nNow this is another thing that's just\nlike some of them you've already seen.\n\n145\n00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:40.800\nKeep in mind that when these\nsecurity pieces of software,\n\n146\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.579\nwhen they look through files,\nthey look at processes that are running.\n\n147\n00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:49.204\nOne of the things that they wanna do is\nthey wanna be able to compare them against\n\n148\n00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:53.357\nknown threats, known vulnerabilities,\nfiles, known processes.\n\n149\n00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:57.417\nSee Microsoft works with these, and I just\nhappen be in a Windows environment, and\n\n150\n00:07:57.417 --> 00:08:00.955\nI'm sure it's not much different in\nsome other operating systems, but\n\n151\n00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:04.377\na lot of the operating system\nmanufacturers are gonna keep hash values\n\n152\n00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:07.890\nof known processes that run\ninside of their operating system.\n\n153\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.850\nNow they might not let you\nreverse engineer it, but\n\n154\n00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.010\nat least this software will be able to\nrecognize what's legit and what's not.\n\n155\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.210\nSo, whether you connect to\nthe Kaspersky Security Network or\n\n156\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.470\nnot is gonna be up to you, but\nI would highly recommend it,\n\n157\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.350\nbecause then you get the advantages\nof a lot of information that you\n\n158\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.030\ndon't really see in the front end, but\nthat's communicating in the backend there.\n\n159\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.560\nSo, it is a good thing to have, and\n\n160\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.890\nyou definitely have to accept\nthe license agreement.\n\n161\n00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.150\nAll right, so\nwe'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n162\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.490\nNow the next thing you can do is,\nyou can set up your SMTP server.\n\n163\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.110\nSee, keep in mind another one of\nthe major things that distinguishes or\n\n164\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.560\ndifferentiates, if you will,\nconsumer-grade software\n\n165\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.070\nfrom the enterprise-grade software,\nis that the enterprise-grade\n\n166\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.350\nsoftware is gonna have to\ncommunicate a lot of notifications.\n\n167\n00:08:53.350 --> 00:09:00.540\nSo if you do have an SMTP server, and\nit's set up, you can always just type in\n\n168\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.830\nthe email that you're gonna use, and\nwe'll go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n169\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.390\nAnd then whatever the SMTP server is.\n\n170\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.250\nYou might need some\nhelp with that acronym.\n\n171\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.042\nThat's SMTP, sometimes hard to spell.\n\n172\n00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:15.459\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very difficult.\n\n173\n00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:16.709\n>> That's right.\n\n174\n00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:19.490\nNow you don't have to set this\ninformation up if you don't want.\n\n175\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.340\nYou can leave it blank and\nyou can move on.\n\n176\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.120\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe'll fill that information out.\n\n177\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.550\nNow, one of the cool things that I like\nabout this, personal opinion here,\n\n178\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.110\none of the cool things I like about this\nis if you've ever worked with WSUS, right,\n\n179\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.190\nthe Windows Server Update Service.\n\n180\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.070\nYou can point your internal clients out to\nthat and control your patch management.\n\n181\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.650\nWell, one of the great things is,\n\n182\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.880\nyou can also control it right here from\nthe administration server if you want.\n\n183\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.250\nNow we're going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to say no, we've got a WSUS sever,\n\n184\n00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.770\nwe're not going to set up\ninternalized patch management.\n\n185\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.610\nAt least not in this episode.\n\n186\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.070\nSo we'll go ahead and\nsay search for critical updates and\n\n187\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.270\nyou'll notice right here,\nuse the WSUS server inside of the network,\n\n188\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.870\nwhich is not integrated in the platform,\nbut if I wanted I could.\n\n189\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.690\nI could integrate that in here, and\nwe could have that consolidated interface.\n\n190\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.690\nRemember, that's one of the main\nthings that we're stressing here,\n\n191\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.250\nis centralized management.\n\n192\n00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.390\nWe could have it all in this\nserver if we really needed to.\n\n193\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.630\n>> And just so I understand you, Wes.\n\n194\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.420\nAre you saying that we are able to\ncontrol Windows security updates or\n\n195\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.190\nthrough Kaspersky, or we're able to\ncontrol Kaspersky updates through WSUS?\n\n196\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.990\n>> It's actually the first\none that you said,\n\n197\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.390\ncontrolling what we do through\nWSUS in a centralized location.\n\n198\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.900\nSo that's nice not to have\na piece of technology here,\n\n199\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.030\na piece of technology here.\n\n200\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.300\nBecause the more decentralized it gets,\n\n201\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.590\nwell, then you're getting back into\nwhat's pretty much the consumer stuff.\n\n202\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.460\nComplete decentralization,\na lot of administrative effort.\n\n203\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.830\nSo it is nice to have a way to consolidate\nexisting technologies into that\n\n204\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.730\ncentralized management interface,\nor at least a single UI.\n\n205\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.380\nAll right, so\nwe'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n206\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.750\nNow what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna create a couple of policies.\n\n207\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.179\nNow again there is another end\nuser license agreement that\n\n208\n00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:05.626\nI have to accept here, and\nthat is that Kaspersky Security Network.\n\n209\n00:11:05.626 --> 00:11:09.103\nSo we need to accept the EULA,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n210\n00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:12.780\nparticipate in that now\nhere's another thing.\n\n211\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.440\nThis is one of the things that also sets\nconsumer grade from enterprise grade,\n\n212\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.520\ncompletely separates them.\n\n213\n00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.520\nYou typically have something known\nas application white listing, right?\n\n214\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.350\nThere are other products that you\nmight wanna make an exception for.\n\n215\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.830\nAnd that's what this is saying right here.\n\n216\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.240\nAnd I won't bore you with all\nthe little fine details here.\n\n217\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.610\nBut it's basically called a trusted zone.\n\n218\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.800\nAnd it says, when Kaspersky\nstarts to look at other software,\n\n219\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.020\ndo you want it to interfere\nwith that software at all?\n\n220\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.300\nYou can actually see some\nother things like UltraVNC and\n\n221\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.740\nthen Symantec right here.\n\n222\n00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.540\nAnd we could say no, we trust this\nsoftware and when Kaspersky installs,\n\n223\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.110\njust go ahead and\nleave that software alone.\n\n224\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.870\nSo that's really what this is about.\n\n225\n00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.585\nAnd you can see that it creates scan\nexclusions for workstations and\n\n226\n00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:56.666\nservers here.\n\n227\n00:11:56.666 --> 00:12:00.544\n>> I would say this is definitely\none of the ways in which Kaspersky\n\n228\n00:12:00.544 --> 00:12:04.510\nkind of defines itself differently\nthan things like Symantec.\n\n229\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.440\nI've actually worked with both\nproducts before at a corporate level.\n\n230\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.570\nAnd when we had Symantec, their philosophy\nwas more we're gonna give you the product\n\n231\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.340\nand then you start turning things\non that you wanna block, right?\n\n232\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.940\nYou start blocking things.\n\n233\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.950\nKaspersky's kinda the opposite direction.\n\n234\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.840\nThey say, we're gonna block stuff and you\ntell us what you don't want us to block.\n\n235\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.430\nNow, and whatever your philosophy may be,\ncuz either's fine.\n\n236\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.670\nIt just depends on how you're\nmore comfortable with working.\n\n237\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.190\nWe saw though that turning it off and\n\n238\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.060\nus finding out we need to open it up is\na whole lot easier, than getting bit by\n\n239\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.600\nthe rattlesnake and then having to clean\nthings up and then shut that down, so\n\n240\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.760\nI tend to like Kaspersky as a product\nbetter because it does that philosophy.\n\n241\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.160\n>> Right, it starts out with\nthe blacklisting versus the white listing.\n\n242\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.459\nBlacklisting saying, hey,\neverything's blocked except what I allow.\n\n243\n00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:56.807\nWhitelisting says, we'll allow everything,\nand then you come back and\n\n244\n00:12:56.807 --> 00:12:59.080\nyou figure out what you\nmight want to block later.\n\n245\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.880\nAgain like Dan said, depending on what\nside you would like to implement,\n\n246\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.180\nyou might have a lot of broken software.\n\n247\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.150\nSo you have to pay attention.\n\n248\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.540\nIt could increase the administrative\ncomplexities here.\n\n249\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.190\nNow, what it's doing is, and let me see\nif I can, and it'll keep running here\n\n250\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.180\nin the background, it's gonna\ncreate a handful of default tasks.\n\n251\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.420\nThese tasks are ones that you\nwill run against your servers and\n\n252\n00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.700\nagainst your clients as it does this.\n\n253\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.390\nYou can see fine vulnerabilities,\nvirus scans,\n\n254\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.780\ninstall updates, all of these really,\nreally good basic tasks.\n\n255\n00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.020\nNow, I'm gonna show you here coming\nup that you can create your own.\n\n256\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.840\nBut it's really good if you need to\nimplement this immediately, you might not\n\n257\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.920\nwant to have to implement the extra\neffort of going what tasks do I need.\n\n258\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.950\nSo this will give you a nice list\nof tasks that are ready to go.\n\n259\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.090\nAnd then you could tailor make these\ntests to whatever suits your company, or\n\n260\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.750\nif you find that these are not\nadequate for your environment,\n\n261\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.860\nyou can also go in after-the-fact,\nyou can create additional ones.\n\n262\n00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.380\nSo don't think that these\ntasks that are created\n\n263\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.670\nhere is the limit to what you can do.\n\n264\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.562\nYou can always customize\nthem a little bit later.\n\n265\n00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:09.082\nAll right, so the next thing that we're\ngoing to have is the proxy settings.\n\n266\n00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:11.709\nAll right, if you're going to use\na proxy server you can set that up here.\n\n267\n00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:16.372\nNow I don't have a proxy server so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n268\n00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:18.310\nI'm gonna choose Next.\n\n269\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.460\nNow here's one of the things\nthat I really like about this.\n\n270\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.220\nIt's downloading its updates\nfrom Kaspersky right now, and\n\n271\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.820\nits always nice when you have\none of these progress bars, Dan.\n\n272\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.070\nThat you don't have to wait on,\n\n273\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:34.810\nespecially if you want to get some of\nthis implemented as fast as you can.\n\n274\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.830\nYou don't have to sit there and\nwait for that progress bar to complete,\n\n275\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.780\nand that's a really good thing there.\n\n276\n00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.376\nSo, we'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n277\n00:14:41.376 --> 00:14:47.890\nAnd now, I could, if I wanted to, I could\nstart protection deployment right here.\n\n278\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.810\nAnd you're gonna see,\n\n279\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.430\nit's gonna be the same thing as the remote\ninstallation that I'm gonna start.\n\n280\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.080\nBut I don't want to do it from here,\n\n281\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.850\nbecause I want to show you the interface\nwhere you can do this yourself.\n\n282\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.130\nNow, if you want, it'll be no different\nthan what you're going to see here\n\n283\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.450\nin a few minutes when we do push\nthis out to a work station.\n\n284\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.250\nSo I'm just going to go ahead and\nleave that blank for now.\n\n285\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.370\nAll right, and the other thing\nthat I'm gonna go ahead and do,\n\n286\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.660\nlet me make a real little slight\nmodification to my network adaptor.\n\n287\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.187\nAnd I also want to point something else\nout, in these next couple of steps that we\n\n288\n00:15:20.187 --> 00:15:24.126\ndo, network discovery,\nif it's turned off, might get in the way.\n\n289\n00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:26.380\nSo you want to make sure\nthat that's turned on.\n\n290\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.530\nSo that when it does try to push\ninformation out to a client,\n\n291\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.460\nit can actually find the client.\n\n292\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.550\nSo we'll go ahead and save those changes.\n\n293\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.722\nAnd this is actually a multi-home server.\n\n294\n00:15:36.722 --> 00:15:40.230\nI'm gonna disable one network adapter and\nenable another one here.\n\n295\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.700\nNow that's for\nthe purposes of this demonstration, guys.\n\n296\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.630\nDo keep that in mind.\n\n297\n00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.048\nAll right, so now we've got\nthe administration server is set up.\n\n298\n00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:51.565\nNow it's gonna tell me that\nthere are a couple of critical\n\n299\n00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:53.308\nevents on the administration server.\n\n300\n00:15:53.308 --> 00:15:55.206\nAnd one of the things\nthat's cool about this is,\n\n301\n00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:56.745\nremember that question that Dan said.\n\n302\n00:15:56.745 --> 00:16:02.150\nDan asked, well, is this Kaspersky's\nupdates, or is this Windows updates?\n\n303\n00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.840\nWell, I could go in here,\nand I could look and\n\n304\n00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.030\nsee that a lot of these\nare Windows updates.\n\n305\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.620\nIf I go to the event here,\nyou'll actually see the KB's,\n\n306\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.090\nwe say, knowledge base, out there.\n\n307\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.870\nIt's support.microsoft.com.\n\n308\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:20.320\nSo, it looks and it says hey, I know by\nmy database that I'm updating right now,\n\n309\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.300\nthat your server doesn't\nhave the current update.\n\n310\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.690\nSo, it flags it right away and it says,\nyou might need to do something about that.\n\n311\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.750\nNow, let's go ahead and collapse some of\nthis, make it a little bit easier to see.\n\n312\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.670\nSo, down the left hand side here,\nthis is where we're gonna be working.\n\n313\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.887\nAll right, one of the places where all of\nour computers are going to be stored once\n\n314\n00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:42.900\nwe push out deployment\nis gonna be right here.\n\n315\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.350\nLet's go ahead, and\nlet's start a remote deployment.\n\n316\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.460\nLet's go ahead and\npush this software out to a client.\n\n317\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:56.530\nNow, one of the things I want to show you,\nthough, is here in our client.\n\n318\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.480\nI wanna show you how this is fairly\ntransparent to the end user.\n\n319\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.890\nThat's another thing that sets\nthese enterprise level software\n\n320\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.130\napart from the rest is that you\ndon't have to be near the machine.\n\n321\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.800\nSo, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\nopen up the programs file, the 32 bit or\n\n322\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.130\nX86 folder.\n\n323\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.432\nAnd I'd like to also take a second here.\n\n324\n00:17:17.172 --> 00:17:21.995\nMake sure that I, I always leave\nan S off that, it's services.msc.\n\n325\n00:17:21.995 --> 00:17:24.460\nAnd I wanna launch our services console,\n\n326\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.310\ncuz I wanna show you\na couple of cool things.\n\n327\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.650\nI kinda find this cool.\n\n328\n00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.750\nAnd if I look at the letter K,\nfor services.\n\n329\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.910\nAll right?\nWhat I am not going to find\n\n330\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.810\nis anything other than\nthis one right here.\n\n331\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.570\nAll right?\nSo, I just wanna kind of show you this,\n\n332\n00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.030\nthat it is going to get deployed out.\n\n333\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.540\nThis is just a built-in Windows service,\n\n334\n00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.480\nhas nothing to do with\nthe Kaspersky Security Center.\n\n335\n00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.520\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n336\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.870\nNotice in the program 86 folder,\nI don't have a Kaspersky folder at all,\n\n337\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.560\nand over here in the services,\nI don't have a Kaspersky service, either.\n\n338\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.660\nSo, that's one of the telltale signs, when\nwe show you this, that it is going to be\n\n339\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.170\ninstalling and pushing that\ninformation out to the client.\n\n340\n00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:07.690\nAll right.\n\n341\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.180\nNow, this is a little\nbit hard to see here.\n\n342\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.870\nLet's see,\nif we can zoom in just a little bit.\n\n343\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.670\nThere we go.\n\n344\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.170\nWe wanna be in the remote\ninstallation section.\n\n345\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.750\nAll right, this is where we're gonna\ncreate an installation package to\n\n346\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.010\npush out whatever the machine might be,\nthat we wanna deploy it to.\n\n347\n00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.010\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n348\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.630\nAll right, now when you select this,\n\n349\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.890\nyou'll see you have some\ninstallation packages.\n\n350\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:34.730\nBut what I really wanna look at is\nthis Start Remote Installation Wizard.\n\n351\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.650\nNow, keep in mind,\nonce we got done with the quick start,\n\n352\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.800\nit gave me the option to put a check\nmark in that and said, go ahead and\n\n353\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.480\nstart with protection deployment.\n\n354\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.509\nAnd you're gonna see this remote\ninstallation wizard is the same thing that\n\n355\n00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:48.739\nwould've showed up, if I would've just\nkept that check mark in that box there.\n\n356\n00:18:51.712 --> 00:18:56.197\nNow, next thing we have to figure out\nare what are the installation packages\n\n357\n00:18:56.197 --> 00:18:58.635\nthat we wanna push out to our endpoints?\n\n358\n00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:03.495\nAre you doing things like, open MDM or\nMDM mobile device management?\n\n359\n00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:07.835\nAre you gonna be setting up\na mobile device management server?\n\n360\n00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:11.755\nOr are we just gonna be\npushing out the security,\n\n361\n00:19:11.755 --> 00:19:14.285\nthe endpoint protection to the agent.\n\n362\n00:19:14.285 --> 00:19:18.720\nNow, we could if we wanted to we\ncould just push out the agent.\n\n363\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.050\nWell, keep in mind,\nthat might be suitable for you but\n\n364\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.030\nwhat we want to do is we want\nto push out the software.\n\n365\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.380\nAnd if you'll pay attention here,\neven though, I'm not telling it to push\n\n366\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.780\nout the Security Center Network Agent,\nnotice down here at the bottom\n\n367\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.270\nit's gonna tell me that even though\nyou're pushing out the security software,\n\n368\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.670\nit needs that network agent in order\nto communicate with a server, so\n\n369\n00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.100\nthis is gonna be bundled in the package.\n\n370\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:50.150\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose Next, now,\nwe don't have any managed computers yet.\n\n371\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.920\nWe've just set up this database,\nwe just set up this software, so\n\n372\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.220\nwe don't have any pre-managed computers.\n\n373\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.620\nNow, I'm kinda lying to you on that one.\n\n374\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.130\nIt will detect itself.\n\n375\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.800\nThe administration server\nwill detect itself, and\n\n376\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.660\nthat's the only managed\ncomputer you'll see there.\n\n377\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.690\nSo, it's aware of itself,\njust nothing else.\n\n378\n00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.180\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nselect computers for deployment.\n\n379\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.010\nAnd notice that your server does show\nup here in the manage computers.\n\n380\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.460\nThat's the administration server here.\n\n381\n00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:23.510\nBut if I go to unassigned devises,\nI can see that that test server is there.\n\n382\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.310\nAnd let's just go ahead and validate here,\n\n383\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.890\nreally quick that that is the computer\nthat we want to push this information out.\n\n384\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.910\nAnd you can see Windows 7 tests there,\n\n385\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.720\nit is there,\nthat's the one that we're going to want.\n\n386\n00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.640\nSo, let's go ahead, and\nwe're going to check that.\n\n387\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.670\nWe're going to choose next.\n\n388\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.100\n>> Unless you're also going to\nuse that add button, correct, and\n\n389\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.460\nthen search by IP address.\n\n390\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.290\n>> Yeah, yes you can.\n\n391\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.560\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nback up and let me show you that.\n\n392\n00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.530\nBecause I can also add this\nmanually if I want, and\n\n393\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.200\nthat's a good thing to show you too.\n\n394\n00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.430\nSo if I have an IP range, right, you have\na subnet that you want to push this out\n\n395\n00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.630\nto, most of the time in large corporations\nyou don't just have a single subnet,\n\n396\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.900\nyou don't have 5,000 computers on a single\nsubnet or nothing's gonna get done, right?\n\n397\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.520\nSo, we usually have multiple subnets.\n\n398\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.570\nYou can have multiple locations,\nso this is good.\n\n399\n00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.420\nWe happen to put an IP range in here,\n\n400\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.850\nif you needed to push it\nout by an entire subnet.\n\n401\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.760\nAnd we can go as far as, and I can even\nmanually enter that computer if I want,\n\n402\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.830\njust to show you guys how to do it.\n\n403\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.920\nSo, we'll do Windows 7 And we'll do test.\n\n404\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.150\nWe'll choose add, and then OK.\n\n405\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.110\nAnd really, it's the same thing here.\n\n406\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.080\nBut just keep in mind,\neither way you can do this.\n\n407\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.560\nNow, we'll go ahead and choose next.\n\n408\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.320\nAnd be careful on this one, okay?\n\n409\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.090\nIt wants you to select a key.\n\n410\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.100\nRight, now this is your activation key.\n\n411\n00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.910\nI don't have an activation key.\n\n412\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.330\nKeep this in mind,\nif you're using the trial subscription.\n\n413\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:45.020\nIf you don't have an activation key,\nsome of the more advanced\n\n414\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.770\nfeatures that you can do will be\ndisabled until you buy the product.\n\n415\n00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.230\nYou get full protection, but\n\n416\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.100\nsome of the more advanced features that\nyou can do might not be available to you.\n\n417\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.260\nDon't worry about it, but just keep in\nmind while you're going through your\n\n418\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.280\ndeployment that you might be deploying\nwith a little bit of a crutch there.\n\n419\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.290\nAnd you can see that it's gonna warn us.\n\n420\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.900\nIf I choose, Next and I don't add one,\nit's gonna say, well,\n\n421\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.320\nhey, you don't have a key in here.\n\n422\n00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.000\nIt's expired.\n\n423\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.220\nAre you sure you wanna do this?\n\n424\n00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.549\nAnd we'll go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n425\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.180\nAnd, now, how intrusive do you want\nthis remote push or deployment to be?\n\n426\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.145\nDo you want it to restart the computer?\n\n427\n00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:26.660\nDo you want it to not\nrestart the computer?\n\n428\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.240\nOr do you want to prompt the user?\n\n429\n00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.820\nIn this case,\nyou have to be careful because\n\n430\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.060\nhow you deploy this to your end users\nmight affect their productivity.\n\n431\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.050\nIf you've got somebody that's sitting\nat that computer right now and\n\n432\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.620\nthey've been doing a lot of work for the\nlast four hours and they don't know how to\n\n433\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.010\nuse the Ctrl+S functionality and\nyou restart that computer on them,\n\n434\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.910\nunfortunately, it might\nwipe all their data out.\n\n435\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.590\nSo, there's no right way or wrong way on\nthis, just plan it accordingly and know\n\n436\n00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.170\nthat you don't ever want to obviously,\ninterrupt your users' productivity.\n\n437\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.530\nBecause what we say in security, right?\n\n438\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.680\nConfidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\n\n439\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.750\nWell, that's going to hinder availability\nif the authorized users don't have access\n\n440\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.550\nto their machines.\n\n441\n00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.330\nSo, I'll go ahead and choose next.\n\n442\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.280\nNow, the other thing is,\nhow about incompatible applications?\n\n443\n00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.100\nDo I have applications on here that,\n\n444\n00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.670\nwhen this software is pushed out,\ndo I want it to uninstall that software?\n\n445\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.560\nWell, I'm not gonna mess\nwith anything here, but\n\n446\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.250\nyou might have to take that\ninto consideration too.\n\n447\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.020\n>> It is a jealous software.\n\n448\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.020\n>> Yes.\n>> That's for sure.\n\n449\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.700\nIt does not like things like Malwarebytes.\n\n450\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.030\nIt doesn't like McAfee, or something.\n\n451\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.300\nIf it sees this stuff on there,\n\n452\n00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.510\nit'll actually remove it before\nit starts the installation\n\n453\n00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.800\ncuz it will not allow itself to be\ninstalled, at least that's what it was\n\n454\n00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.687\nthe last time I was working with it so-\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n455\n00:23:37.687 --> 00:23:38.539\n>> Yeah, yeah,\n\n456\n00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:40.460\nthat's exactly what it is Dan.\n\n457\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.730\nThey do not play nice.\n\n458\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.730\nThey don't like each other.\n\n459\n00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.282\nIf you're on that side\nof the basketball court.\n\n460\n00:23:46.282 --> 00:23:49.270\nThey like it, but if you're on opposite\nsides, man, it's time to square off here.\n\n461\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.069\n>> Afterwards, they'll allow you.\n\n462\n00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:54.878\nOnce you first get it solved\n>> Then you can run Malwarebytes\n\n463\n00:23:54.878 --> 00:23:56.582\nagain if you want, get it installed.\n\n464\n00:23:56.582 --> 00:24:00.530\nIf you, somehow, I wish they would\nblock the whole McAfee suite.\n\n465\n00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.045\nBut I'll leave that for my own musings.\n\n466\n00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:05.260\n[LAUGH] But after that,\nafter you get Kaspersky installed,\n\n467\n00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.840\nthen you can install other software that\nit says that it's incompatible with.\n\n468\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.070\n>> That's right.\nIt gets on the system.\n\n469\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.410\nIt says, well, this is my turf, man,\nand I'm gonna take you off of there.\n\n470\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.350\nSo, again, make sure you do\na little bit of your research here.\n\n471\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:21.000\nNow, the other thing that we got going\non here is that when this is remotely\n\n472\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.510\npushed out notice that it might\nbe an unassigned computer, right?\n\n473\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:30.430\nAnd it's gonna ask you if you wanna\npush this out do you wanna turn this\n\n474\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.140\ninto a managed computer?\n\n475\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.890\nAnd that's what it's saying.\n\n476\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.350\nIt's saying I'm gonna automatically, once\nI push this software out, I'll look in\n\n477\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.210\nyour administration server and I'll\nput that in the managed computers now.\n\n478\n00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:46.470\nSo, that from here on out, you can start\nrunning scans against it if you need to.\n\n479\n00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.000\nSo, we'll go ahead and say yes to this.\n\n480\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.830\nNow, it's gonna need a local account.\n\n481\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.860\nOr, if you're in an active\ndirectory environment,\n\n482\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.950\nneeds an administrative account.\n\n483\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.660\nAnd most likely you probably will be\nin a domain environment where we don't\n\n484\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.960\ndo centralized identity management\nof 5,000 computers in a work group.\n\n485\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.538\nRight?\n[LAUGH] It's not happening.\n\n486\n00:25:04.538 --> 00:25:06.187\nSo-\n>> You've got one jacked up network.\n\n487\n00:25:06.187 --> 00:25:07.810\n>> [LAUGH] That's true, yeah.\n\n488\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.545\nAbsolutely.\n\n489\n00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:09.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we'll go ahead and\n\n490\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.079\nput the administrator in here.\n\n491\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.251\nAnd we'll use that super secret\npassword of dot, dot, dot, dot.\n\n492\n00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:20.722\nChoose OK.\n\n493\n00:25:20.722 --> 00:25:21.960\nNext.\n\n494\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.550\nAnd what it's gonna do after I click\nnext is create couple of tasks.\n\n495\n00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:29.080\nRemember that everything is a task.\n\n496\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.640\nA scan is a task.\n\n497\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.070\nA deployment is a task that's created.\n\n498\n00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.120\nRemember when we started the installation,\nit rifled through and\n\n499\n00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.020\ncreated about seven tasks.\n\n500\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.280\nThat's what everything is here.\n\n501\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.040\nEverything is a task.\n\n502\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.100\nAnd you can see that the task has started.\n\n503\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.070\nSo we'll choose next and give it a second.\n\n504\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.730\nWait for it.\n\n505\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.294\nIt's got to catch up for me.\n\n506\n00:25:51.628 --> 00:25:52.650\nAll right.\n\n507\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.410\nNow, I want to kind of rifle in on\nthis real quick and show you guys.\n\n508\n00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.920\nAll right.\nNotice that it's telling me,\n\n509\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.350\nI'm going to try that again.\n\n510\n00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.392\nNotice that it's telling me it's preparing\nthat to push it out to the client.\n\n511\n00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:08.800\nIt's doing,\nI don't have a DNS server here, guys.\n\n512\n00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.210\nSo, what's going on?\n\n513\n00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.920\nIt's using net BIOS.\n\n514\n00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.860\nIt's calling out and\n\n515\n00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.270\nit's saying, hey, who's out there\nthat's got this IP address.\n\n516\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.380\nSo it found it.\n\n517\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.510\nNow, I want to get back over\nto that client real quick and\n\n518\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.710\nshow you guys something really cool.\n\n519\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.200\nI really like this.\n\n520\n00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.670\nNow, it takes a second, but\none of the things that the client\n\n521\n00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.110\nwon't see is the whole\ndeployment behind the scenes.\n\n522\n00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.070\nSo, as far as productivity, if we\n\n523\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.340\ndo have a client sitting at this computer\nright now and we've said, no, that's okay.\n\n524\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.160\nDon't restart the computer and\nprompt the user.\n\n525\n00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.700\nThey're not gonna know, really,\nthat anything is going on.\n\n526\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.370\nBut we can see now between\nInternet Explorer,\n\n527\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.980\nthe default directories that are here.\n\n528\n00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.470\nWe can see, Kaspersky Lab has showed up.\n\n529\n00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.010\nAnd if I look in the background here.\n\n530\n00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.900\nAnd let me do a refresh here.\n\n531\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.900\nAction.\n\n532\n00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.400\nThere we go.\n\n533\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.430\nI can see that there's a couple in here.\n\n534\n00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.330\nThat one right there is\nthe agent installer.\n\n535\n00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.240\nThat's the installation process.\n\n536\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.380\nThat's gonna disappear.\n\n537\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.070\nThere's another one.\n\n538\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.550\nI didn't get to it fast enough.\n\n539\n00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.770\nThere's a couple of them here\nthat are temporary services\n\n540\n00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.290\nthat are just going through\nthe installation process.\n\n541\n00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.950\nAnd once the installation, or\n\n542\n00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.030\nthe remote installation is done,\nthose services erase themselves.\n\n543\n00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:26.590\nWhat doesn't erase itself, though,\nis the Kaspersky Security Agent service.\n\n544\n00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.260\nAnd, as you can see,\nthis service has to be here.\n\n545\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.425\nIt has to be started to allow\nthe communication between the client and\n\n546\n00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:35.020\nthe server itself.\n\n547\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.760\nIf it's not here,\nwe have no communication, or\n\n548\n00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.170\nwe don't have any communication.\n\n549\n00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.582\nNow, that kind of shows us that\nthe client is being installed.\n\n550\n00:27:43.582 --> 00:27:45.250\nI'm gonna bump over here just for\n\n551\n00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.450\na second because we will see\nsome other things going on.\n\n552\n00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.100\nHere in Windows 7 you\ngot the action center.\n\n553\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.290\nAnd the action center is very\ngood at letting you know\n\n554\n00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.770\nsecurity related events when they happen.\n\n555\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.820\nLike, for instance,\nyour firewall's been turned off.\n\n556\n00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.810\nWindows Defender is no longer turned on.\n\n557\n00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.720\nAnd that's about the only interaction that\nthe end user is gonna see that something's\n\n558\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.470\ngoing on to their computer.\n\n559\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.470\nSo, it might be a good idea if\nyou're gonna push out this software\n\n560\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.710\nto let everybody know.\n\n561\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.110\nBecause if anybody is just\neven remotely tech savvy and\n\n562\n00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.890\nthey see Windows Defender has been turned\noff, your firewall's been turned of,\n\n563\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.010\nthey're gonna say, what's going on man,\nsomebody's attacking my computer.\n\n564\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:23.560\nIn fact, there we go.\n\n565\n00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.960\nYou can see it there.\n\n566\n00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.500\nIt, kinda difficult to see there.\n\n567\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.800\nBut our Windows Defender,\nit's telling me turn it on.\n\n568\n00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.910\nWell, what's going on?\n\n569\n00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:37.450\nIn this process here what's happening\nis Kaspersky, through that account that\n\n570\n00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:42.490\nI said, go ahead and install the software,\nit's taking over the security platform.\n\n571\n00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.810\nIt's turning off Defender.\n\n572\n00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.950\nCuz like Dan said earlier,\nthey don't play nice together.\n\n573\n00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.750\nYou don't have two pieces\nof security class software\n\n574\n00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.030\ncuz they're gonna kind of butt heads.\n\n575\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.840\nSo what has to happen?\n\n576\n00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.425\nDefender has to be turned off so\nKaspersky can do it's job.\n\n577\n00:28:57.425 --> 00:28:59.500\n>> Yeah.\nKaspersky definitely wants to be the king\n\n578\n00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.260\nof the castle when it comes\nto security for your PC.\n\n579\n00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.362\nAnd, what's an interesting thing,\njust from experience here,\n\n580\n00:29:06.362 --> 00:29:10.200\nyou might get some support\ntickets after it's installed.\n\n581\n00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.500\nThey might not see that one, or they're\nexpecting that Defender has been shut down\n\n582\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.730\nand the Window's firewall's been disabled\nfor the purposes of getting it installed.\n\n583\n00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.940\nBut after that you might get\nsome random help tickets saying\n\n584\n00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.480\nI'm getting an action center I\nhave a red flag or something\n\n585\n00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.760\nshowing up at the bottom of my computer\nsaying I don't have anti-virus installed.\n\n586\n00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.550\nThat happens because the engine\ndoesn't quite start up until after\n\n587\n00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.250\nWindows does its check.\n\n588\n00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.290\nSo they might get that.\n\n589\n00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.180\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n590\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.050\nIt's not that you don't\nhave antivirus installed.\n\n591\n00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.860\nIt's installed.\nIt's running.\n\n592\n00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.390\nYou'll be able to see from the management\nconsole, green lights across the board.\n\n593\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.830\nAnd only if you go there and\nyou see a red on that\n\n594\n00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.220\nspecific workstation do you\nreally have an actual problem.\n\n595\n00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.840\nBut other than that, you might get some\nfalse positives from the action center.\n\n596\n00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.790\n>> Let's show you exactly\nwhat Dan's talking about.\n\n597\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.120\nWe can put that in action here.\n\n598\n00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.960\nIf we switch over to our manage\ncomputers here, and hopefully here.\n\n599\n00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.700\nIt's taking a second.\n\n600\n00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.660\nIt's a little job,\nit's doing a lot of stuff here.\n\n601\n00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.370\nAnd apparently,\n\n602\n00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:11.123\nit's gonna take a second before it\ndecides that it wants to work again.\n\n603\n00:30:11.123 --> 00:30:15.510\nYou can see down here, in fact,\nyou can see down here in the lower\n\n604\n00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.660\nright hand corner that it's telling me\nthat the setup process has started.\n\n605\n00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.961\nSo, if you do get into here, and\nhopefully you can get in here.\n\n606\n00:30:30.044 --> 00:30:32.910\n>> While you're waiting for that,\nwe have a question in our chat room.\n\n607\n00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.740\nSays in order push out the deployment,\n\n608\n00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.170\nare you essentially mapping drives\nto the Kaspersky admin server?\n\n609\n00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.630\nIf memory serves me,\nit's actually the other way around.\n\n610\n00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:47.020\nWhere Kaspersky's actually opening\nthe administrative share of the local\n\n611\n00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.270\ncomputer.\n\n612\n00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.790\nSo, if, like I said, if I'm remembering\ncorrectly, that's what's happening.\n\n613\n00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.070\nThat's why you need the local\nadministrator login credentials so\n\n614\n00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.770\nthat you can access that share.\n\n615\n00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.670\nAnd then it'll push that across your\nnetwork and drop the software in there and\n\n616\n00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.270\nthen start the deployment using\nthe agent once the agent starts up.\n\n617\n00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.096\n>> That's absolutely correct, there.\n\n618\n00:31:06.096 --> 00:31:09.580\nAnd you'll notice that, for one,\nwith the service that was started,\n\n619\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.440\nthat I told you was a temporary service,\nit had a little dollar sign after it.\n\n620\n00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.750\nIt's an administrative service.\n\n621\n00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.640\nSo, it's the same thing.\n\n622\n00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.150\nIt's a temporary administrative share that\nit puts on there to unpack the files.\n\n623\n00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.410\nAnd then it removes some\nof those backup files.\n\n624\n00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.100\nAnd then what remains is the Kaspersky\nfolder that's gonna be in the program\n\n625\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.420\nx86 directory.\n\n626\n00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.830\nAnd that's what's happening.\n\n627\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.640\nIt's pushing it out from\none location to the next.\n\n628\n00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.260\nAnd you can see that\nthe application is initializing.\n\n629\n00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.980\nAnd, you know Dan,\nI might not get to this in time to-\n\n630\n00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.310\n>> Oh, you got a green light?\n\n631\n00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.326\n>> We got the green light.\n\n632\n00:31:38.326 --> 00:31:39.540\nSo i,t is completed.\n\n633\n00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.100\nThat is a good thing.\n\n634\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.140\nAnd if I was to come in here and\nI was to see anything other than green,\n\n635\n00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.940\nexcept if it's into, maybe the error\nreturn, it's gonna let you know.\n\n636\n00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.040\nThis whole thing, that whole pie graph\nright there is going to turn red on you.\n\n637\n00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.360\nAnd, unfortunately that's not\na good day at the office.\n\n638\n00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.994\nSo, fairly, once you know a little bit\naround the interface it's fairly easy to\n\n639\n00:32:01.994 --> 00:32:03.370\npush out a deployment.\n\n640\n00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.430\nWork with it a little bit.\n\n641\n00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.580\nIf you're not familiar with it,\nmost of these software,\n\n642\n00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.230\nespecially at the enterprise level, they\nreally want you to purchase their product.\n\n643\n00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.890\nSo, they have a good help files.\n\n644\n00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.940\nAnd I can tell you,\nKaspersky is not really any different.\n\n645\n00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.190\nIt's got a lot of good on\nboard help files, too.\n\n646\n00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:24.050\nSo that if, maybe you're in\na heavily managed environment and\n\n647\n00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.120\nyou don't want this server\nconnecting out to the internet,\n\n648\n00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.430\nit may be just temporarily\nto do its updates.\n\n649\n00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.515\nThe good thing here is that Kaspersky's\ngot a lot of on board help files.\n\n650\n00:32:32.515 --> 00:32:33.870\nSo, pretty straightforward process.\n\n651\n00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.200\n>> Their quick start guide is amazing.\n\n652\n00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.540\nActually, I used to reference\nthat thing all the time.\n\n653\n00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.910\nIt has just about every kind of quick and\n\n654\n00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.820\ndirty thing that you may need\nto get this thing going.\n\n655\n00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.080\nAnd even some troubleshooting tips for\nyou.\n\n656\n00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.390\nSo, don't discard their quick start guide.\n\n657\n00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:49.940\nCheck that out.\n\n658\n00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.510\nAnd then, of course,\n\n659\n00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.590\ntheir full user manual is gonna\nhave every bell and whistle.\n\n660\n00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.330\nHow to do it, how to work with it,\nturn this off, turn that on.\n\n661\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.130\nWhatever the case is, it's in there.\n\n662\n00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.010\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n663\n00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.500\nSo, for the most part, fairly easy setup.\n\n664\n00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.870\nUse those guides if you're\nnot familiar with it.\n\n665\n00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.910\nAnd, as far as the deployment goes,\nit's in a centralized environment,\n\n666\n00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:13.290\nmaybe you might even create your own\naccount, a specific account to push out,\n\n667\n00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.810\nthat has administrative\nrights within your domain so\n\n668\n00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.350\nthat you can use that account\nto do the remote deployments.\n\n669\n00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.490\nBut, if you are gonna\nuse accounts like that,\n\n670\n00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.830\njust make sure that you keep them safe,\nbecause they're gonna have access to some\n\n671\n00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.540\nof the lowest levels of\nthe operating system.\n\n672\n00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.541\nKind of like, things like root kits.\n\n673\n00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:28.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n674\n00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.625\n>> So, Dan, very,\nvery straightforward process there.\n\n675\n00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:31.665\n>> Yes.\nVery much so.\n\n676\n00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:32.245\nWell, Wes,\n\n677\n00:33:32.245 --> 00:33:36.305\nis there anything else we need to cover\nbefore we let our viewers take off?\n\n678\n00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:37.975\n>> No.\nJust make sure that you do\n\n679\n00:33:37.975 --> 00:33:39.007\nyour updates, right?\n\n680\n00:33:39.007 --> 00:33:40.805\nI kinda cut the updates just for\n\n681\n00:33:40.805 --> 00:33:44.445\nthe purposes of demonstration\na little bit short there.\n\n682\n00:33:44.445 --> 00:33:46.965\nMake sure you run your full updates.\n\n683\n00:33:46.965 --> 00:33:49.075\nIt is no different than\nthe consumer grade software.\n\n684\n00:33:49.075 --> 00:33:50.750\nWe say best practice.\n\n685\n00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.120\nKeep everything patched.\n\n686\n00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.530\nKeep all your virus\ndefinitions up to date.\n\n687\n00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.310\nYou can't be aware of what\na virus is if you don't have\n\n688\n00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.260\nthe definition to define\nwhat it looks like.\n\n689\n00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.970\nSo, make sure that your software\nis updated and you should be good.\n\n690\n00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:03.550\n>> Awesome.\n\n691\n00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.440\nWell, Wes, thanks so\nmuch for that demonstration.\n\n692\n00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.080\nIt's very awesome thing\nthat we can now Kaspersky.\n\n693\n00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.150\nWe're a little more familiar with\nhow it actually operates and works.\n\n694\n00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.960\nHopefully you guys out\nthere got a lot of this.\n\n695\n00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.267\nWe sure did.\nThanks for showing us that.\n\n696\n00:34:14.267 --> 00:34:15.880\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Thank you guys for watching.\n\n697\n00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.150\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n698\n00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.940\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n699\n00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:20.930\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n700\n00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:23.125\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n701\n00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:28.040\n[NOISE]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.740\nin this episode we're gonna continue on\nwith some more antivirus anti-malware.\n\n5\n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.940\nAnd continuing even further on with\nour Kaspersky Security Center and\n\n6\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.070\nlooking at that.\n\n7\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.310\nAnd coming back and joining us yet\nagain here in the studio,\n\n8\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.910\nto help continue on there mission,\nis none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.740\nWes, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.670\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.472\n>> It's going great, thanks for\nhaving me back here.\n\n12\n00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:39.572\nWe get to get into the fun\nstuff in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:44.302\nAnd we're gonna look a little bit into\nmonitoring your clients, because, well,\n\n14\n00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:49.168\nthat's what the whole enterprise software\nis about, is monitoring those clients,\n\n15\n00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:51.939\nbeing able to push scans out,\ninitiate scans and\n\n16\n00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:53.992\nseeing the results of those scans.\n\n17\n00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:58.290\nBasically, just being able to see the\ninformation from a centralized location.\n\n18\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.318\nSo, let's go ahead and let's take a look.\n\n19\n00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:04.597\nWe've got our Kaspersky security\ncenter ready to go here, and\n\n20\n00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.382\nthis is the default view.\n\n21\n00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:09.339\nAnd one of the first places\nthat we're gonna go,\n\n22\n00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:11.874\nnow that we have pushed out our software.\n\n23\n00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:13.520\nWe did that in the previous episode.\n\n24\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.410\nIf you haven't checked that out,\ngo back and check it out.\n\n25\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.343\nBut now we have a computer\nthat is a managed computer,\n\n26\n00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:20.719\nand that is what we want.\n\n27\n00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.920\nSo let's go ahead and let's take a look\nat the manage computer section here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.870\nNow, we had mentioned that\nwhen you have your client and\n\n29\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.300\nmanagement interface, it really should be.\n\n30\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.640\nAny good piece of software is gonna give\nyou some kind of a quick visualization\n\n31\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.315\nthat either the nodes or endpoints that\nyou're monitoring are in a healthy state,\n\n32\n00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:45.086\nor whether maybe they have\nsome issues going on.\n\n33\n00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:48.280\nIn fact, I think it was Dan that\nmentioned in the last episode.\n\n34\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.041\nYou usually see some kind of red\nindicator or a green indicator.\n\n35\n00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.535\nThat's right on par with what\nKaspersky does here, and\n\n36\n00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:57.521\nyou can see it right here in our\ninterface, our Manage Computers.\n\n37\n00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.252\nYou'll notice that the server itself,\n\n38\n00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:05.485\nwith a server it doesn't look like\nwe've got, something's going on here.\n\n39\n00:02:05.485 --> 00:02:09.745\nAnd if I take a look over here, I can see\nhere that anti-virus isn't installed.\n\n40\n00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:13.656\nIn fact in the server side,\nespecially on the administration server,\n\n41\n00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.650\none of the things that can happen if\nthe security software is installed.\n\n42\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.984\nIt might lock down locations like for\ninstance your centralized updates.\n\n43\n00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:25.030\nWell, your computers are going to have\nto be able to pull those updates down.\n\n44\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.450\nWe certainly don't want those\ndirectories to be locked off.\n\n45\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.860\nSo I haven't installed any software here,\n\n46\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.570\nbut let's say we did have\nan issue on one of these clients.\n\n47\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.947\nThat's exactly what you'd see right there.\n\n48\n00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:35.862\nYou'd see a little red icon.\n\n49\n00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:39.124\nNow we'll notice here too\nthat we also have what?\n\n50\n00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:42.286\nWe have our WIN7-TEST machine,\n\n51\n00:02:42.286 --> 00:02:47.200\nthe work station that we\npushed out that software to.\n\n52\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.300\nAnd we can see that it's in the green,\nso that's really a good thing.\n\n53\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.050\nIt lets me know just\na quick heads up that, hey.\n\n54\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.130\nThis software is doing its job, and\nat least since it's last checked in\n\n55\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.210\nwith the administration server,\nhopefully everything's okay.\n\n56\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.180\nAnd I can get a little bit\nmore information here,\n\n57\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.890\nwhether the agents installed.\n\n58\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.540\nWhen is the last update?\n\n59\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.454\nWhen's the last time it\ncommunicated with the server?\n\n60\n00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:12.670\nBut it doesn't really just stop there.\n\n61\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.190\nWe can get a lot more information too.\n\n62\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.400\nAnd I really like the heads up when\nyou select one of these machines.\n\n63\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.750\nYou'll see over here on the right\nhand side that we really do get\n\n64\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.170\na fairly good amount of information.\n\n65\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.540\nJust a quick heads up on what's\ngoing on with this machine.\n\n66\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.510\nProtection status,\n\n67\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.430\nwe can see that the agent, the Kaspersky\nagent is running on the machine.\n\n68\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.070\nWhen was the last time it's updated,\nand it's kinda interesting too.\n\n69\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.090\nI've also seen that there\nwere two viruses found.\n\n70\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.390\nSo we can find out without having to go\n\n71\n00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.920\nover to the machine which is again, as we\ncontinue on in enterprise great software.\n\n72\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.166\nWe don't have to over to that computer,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.674\nWe don't have to call somebody up and\nsay, well how's your computer running?\n\n74\n00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:58.950\nCan you open up a log for me here?\n\n75\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800\nCan we see what's going on?\n\n76\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.790\nNow, you could do that but there again,\n\n77\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.600\nnow you're going back into more of\nthe decentralized administration.\n\n78\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.180\nAnd you're going back basically,\n\n79\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.800\ntaking a few steps back in to what you\nwould get out of consumer grade software.\n\n80\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.680\nNow it is important.\n\n81\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.620\nThat you do keep this\ninformation available.\n\n82\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.875\nLike I said,\nif we switch over to our client here.\n\n83\n00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:25.199\nI can see logs if I need to,\njust by going up to reports.\n\n84\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.450\nAnd we've got that information\nright there for us.\n\n85\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.800\nBut keep in mind, with that information,\nthat's decentralized.\n\n86\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.500\nI'm certainly not gonna wanna\nwalk to 5,000 individual\n\n87\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.680\ncomputers looking at this\ninformation on the client.\n\n88\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.610\nSo we also have this\ninformation on the server and\n\n89\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.310\nthat's very good information to have.\n\n90\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.470\nSo we can go over to things\nlike your Reports and\n\n91\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.890\nNotifications here, and you have a lot\nof information you can get, right.\n\n92\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.178\nAll different kinds of information,\ndepending on what you want.\n\n93\n00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:56.579\nVirus reports, vulnerability reports,\nor maybe again,\n\n94\n00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:58.560\nI just wanna quick heads-up you.\n\n95\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.710\nSo I can go to reports and\nnotifications, and\n\n96\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.790\nI can see,\nin this interface here it's a pie graph.\n\n97\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.200\nI can see a portion of the computers\nthat aren't having a problem, and\n\n98\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.260\nan indication that one,\nin this case, is having a problem.\n\n99\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.970\nAnd that's directly related back to what\nwe've seen when it comes to the server\n\n100\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.550\nitself, versus that client\nthat had some issues going on.\n\n101\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.440\nOr well, the client didn't have the\nissues, it was the server having issues.\n\n102\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.930\nNow, if I wanna see\nthings like deployments,\n\n103\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.380\nI can see things like deployments.\n\n104\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.230\nI can see has the agent been deployed,\nand if it was deployed, was it succesful?\n\n105\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.878\nUpdates as well.\n\n106\n00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:43.060\nHave my clients within the network,\nhave they been updated?\n\n107\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.740\nHere's the one that we really want, right?\n\n108\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.660\nAn anti-virus show should be able to\nshow us a little bit about anti-virus or\n\n109\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.630\nvirus statistics.\n\n110\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.520\nAnd we can see that we do\nhave some information here.\n\n111\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.310\nKeep in mind that the Network agent that\nruns on the client communicates back with\n\n112\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.880\nthe servers periodically.\n\n113\n00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.730\nAnd this table here or\nthis interface will update.\n\n114\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.100\nIn fact, you can almost catch it in\nrealtime here in the background.\n\n115\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.930\nIt is kinda updating itself\nevery few seconds here.\n\n116\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.380\nAnd you can see that little\nspinning wheel there.\n\n117\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.510\nIt's spinning its gears, and\nit's updating the interface.\n\n118\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.160\nNow, if I want to figure out\nwhat is going on on the machine.\n\n119\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.560\nI can see that there's a virus here.\n\n120\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.700\nAnd how do I know that?\n\n121\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.230\nWell, let's give you guys\na chance to see it out there.\n\n122\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.170\nMost frequent viruses I can see\ncompared to this graph on the left\n\n123\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.530\nhand side is that it's found\ntwo Some kind of malware there.\n\n124\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.660\nIt's found two of them.\n\n125\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.165\nAnd I can see that the most frequent\ndetections happen to be this little Trojan\n\n126\n00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:44.940\nransomware type virus.\n\n127\n00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.560\nAnd if I want to find out a little bit\nmore information I can always just\n\n128\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.590\nclick on that.\n\n129\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.570\nAnd then what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna generate a report for me.\n\n130\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.420\nNow one of the things that I did\nbefore we started this episode\n\n131\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.530\nis this software here specifically\nuses ActiveX controls.\n\n132\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.116\nYour servers, typically you don't want\nto be running ActiveX on your servers\n\n133\n00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:10.068\njust because it does suffer from\nsome vulnerabilities in Java.\n\n134\n00:07:10.068 --> 00:07:14.100\nAnd like we see in some of the other\nsoftware, you might have to enable a Java\n\n135\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.050\nfeature to be able to get\nthe full functionality here.\n\n136\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.200\nSo, understand that if you get this little\ninformation bar across your web browser\n\n137\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.420\nwhen you go to load this up,\nit's because it's blocking by default.\n\n138\n00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.350\nThat enhanced security configuration that\nwarrants when the server is blocking that\n\n139\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.900\ncontent from being viewed.\n\n140\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.844\nBut what I really like to see\nis the information itself.\n\n141\n00:07:32.844 --> 00:07:35.199\nNotice that I get a lot\nof good information.\n\n142\n00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.854\nI get the detected object, all right.\n\n143\n00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:41.653\nI get, what is it?\n\n144\n00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:43.570\nIt's easy just to say it's a virus.\n\n145\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.170\nWell viruses, a lot of times\npeople lump them all together and\n\n146\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.310\nthey just say it's a virus.\n\n147\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.041\nAnd you guys that have been following\nalong with us know that's not really\n\n148\n00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:51.588\nthe case.\n\n149\n00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:55.102\nVirus is just a small piece of\nthe puzzle when we talk about malware.\n\n150\n00:07:55.102 --> 00:07:57.659\nMalware is more of the umbrella term, and\n\n151\n00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:00.664\nthen the different types\nof malware beneath it.\n\n152\n00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:03.264\nSo we can see that this is a trojan here.\n\n153\n00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:06.911\nWe can see that it's detected\na trojan a couple of times here.\n\n154\n00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:11.970\nWe can see the different files here,\nand some additional information.\n\n155\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.910\nNow the other information that we\nhave here, and this is really,\n\n156\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.690\nreally important.\n\n157\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.040\nWhat group was this computer in?\n\n158\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.750\nAll right, I can see that it's\nin the managed computers group,\n\n159\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.760\nwhich is where we've placed that computer.\n\n160\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.385\nI can see the name of the computer,\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:33.080\nIt's very important not to just\nbe generic when you find a virus.\n\n162\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.350\nRight, that main interface\nis a little generic.\n\n163\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.670\nIt says hey, we found a couple\nof a threat events if you will\n\n164\n00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.540\nthat have been detected.\n\n165\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.560\nBut I really wanna know which machines?\n\n166\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.770\nRight, because in a large\nenvironment you might have for\n\n167\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.320\ninstance a group of servers, that maybe\na computer, a workstation can talk to.\n\n168\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.920\nMaybe that's the only few\nworkstations that it can talk to.\n\n169\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.020\nYou really wanna know which workstation\nthat is so you can isolate it down.\n\n170\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.390\nI can also see, and\n\n171\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.090\nagain directly related to the information\nup here, what was detected.\n\n172\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.840\nI can see the time and\ndate that it was detected.\n\n173\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.210\nThis is really cool because\nI can see the location.\n\n174\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.580\nNow you think,\nwhy would that be important to me?\n\n175\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.080\nWell, I might want to do\nsome kind of trend analysis.\n\n176\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.570\nI might want to figure out\nwhere's a commonality, right?\n\n177\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.940\nWhat are the actions a user is taking,\nif it is the user, right?\n\n178\n00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.060\nWell I can see that this is\nin the user profile here,\n\n179\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.880\nin app data where\ntemporary files are stored.\n\n180\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.130\nAnd again, if you start to have this\ntrend, the same thing over and over and\n\n181\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.550\nover, this might give you some kind of\nindication that whatever the user's doing,\n\n182\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.990\nthey're doing the exact\nsame thing repetitively,\n\n183\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.310\nthat is causing this problem.\n\n184\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.140\nIt's not just a a random fly\nby night infection, right?\n\n185\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.970\nIf I see the same location,\nmaybe and time pattern, right?\n\n186\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.250\nI can maybe proactively\ncall that end user, right?\n\n187\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.280\nInstead of waiting for\nhelp desk and them calling us and\n\n188\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.130\nwe have to solve the problem, maybe we\ncan be a little bit more proactive right?\n\n189\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.140\nWe can call that end user and we can say,\nhey I see that this is happening,\n\n190\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.910\nand it's directly related to x, y, z.\n\n191\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.730\nIn this case it's in the user profile, but\n\n192\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.950\nit might be specific to\nan application itself.\n\n193\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.250\nYou might see something in here that's\ngot a little temporary file in there and\n\n194\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.490\nit has a name on it.\n\n195\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.120\nA lot of times it's not\ngonna be that easy,\n\n196\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.370\nor we wouldn't be using this software\nif it was that easy to find.\n\n197\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.050\nBut it's really, really good\ninformation to have nonetheless.\n\n198\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.080\nLet me get some of that.\n\n199\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.350\n>> Yeah, actually,\nI've used this a lot as well,\n\n200\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.210\nthat very piece of information\nthat Wes is talking about.\n\n201\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.270\nWhere is this thing being located?\n\n202\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.184\nAgain, using that information to see, are\nyou continually reinstalling something you\n\n203\n00:10:41.184 --> 00:10:44.224\nshouldn't be doing, and\nwe're having to continually wipe it out.\n\n204\n00:10:44.224 --> 00:10:50.440\nBut it also comes in handy because every\nantivirus solution is not perfect, right?\n\n205\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.120\nThere is no perfect solution out there.\n\n206\n00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.280\nYou typically have to either\nsupport it yourself, or\n\n207\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.090\nuse some other supplemental\nsoftware to support it as well.\n\n208\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.850\nAnd I've noticed that sometimes with this,\nSemantic, other products that I've used,\n\n209\n00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.610\nthat if you get things like this, and\nit tries to delete it, it can't delete it.\n\n210\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.190\nFor whatever reason,\nGod only knows why It's unable to\n\n211\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.630\nget rid of this even though it might\nnot actually be something horrible, but\n\n212\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.180\nit's something that's being flagged and\nneeds to go away.\n\n213\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.989\nThen I can go in as an administrator and\njust, I don't even have to call the user,\n\n214\n00:11:20.989 --> 00:11:24.742\nI could just through my network attach to\nthat and go through the administrative\n\n215\n00:11:24.742 --> 00:11:28.438\nshare, look at the C drive on their\ncomputer, browse to that actual folder and\n\n216\n00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.580\ndelete it using my super user\nadministrative privileges.\n\n217\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.140\nAnd that's how I know where to go is\nusing that information right there.\n\n218\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.050\nIt does come in very handy\nwhen you got to go through and\n\n219\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.200\nclean up stuff that it\njust wasn't able to get.\n\n220\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.410\n>> For sure, and\nin fact moving along that same idea,\n\n221\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.210\nif you look right here,\nremember the types, right?\n\n222\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.770\nWe've talked about things like trojans,\nbotnets, you know, spyware,\n\n223\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:51.760\nviruses, worms.\n\n224\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.350\nWell, if I say that this is a worm\n\n225\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.860\nI might see that this has been\nisolated to an entire sub net.\n\n226\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.550\nI might see a trend here\nthat says ten dot, and\n\n227\n00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:06.040\nI might have at the end\nhere dot 30.10.40.50.\n\n228\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.850\nAnd I might see that now what I've\ngot is an infection that's trying to\n\n229\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.850\nhop it's way through my network, and\nhopefully we've got some kind of\n\n230\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.600\nACL on our network devices that we can\ncouple in additional technologies and\n\n231\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.420\nreally shut this thing down.\n\n232\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.150\nThe other really cool thing here too\nthat we can see here is the version of\n\n233\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.452\nthe database that we have.\n\n234\n00:12:26.452 --> 00:12:30.550\nAll right if I see multiple\nhappenings over and over and\n\n235\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.410\nover thank goodness that\nit is taking care of it.\n\n236\n00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.620\nOne of the things that we might\nwant to keep in mind is that,\n\n237\n00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.690\ndo I see that a trend in the fact that,\n\n238\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.660\nyou know it's an out of date version,\nright an out of date database.\n\n239\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.780\nWell then I can turn around and\nupdate that database.\n\n240\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.830\nAnd then I can come back and\n\n241\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.060\nuse that information to see\nif that solves the problem.\n\n242\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.270\nSo it really is good, not only for\nmonitoring, but it's also good to\n\n243\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.400\nimplement some kind of proactive solution\nthat yes, it did hit a few computers, but\n\n244\n00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.270\nnow that I can see this information,\nI can gather it together and\n\n245\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.320\nwe can work through a solution to maybe\nimplement additional technologies too.\n\n246\n00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.890\nSo, I can see a lot of\ngood information here.\n\n247\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.130\nYou can see the graphs as well, too.\n\n248\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.580\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n249\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:20.790\none of the things that we might do here\nis check out the client side real quick.\n\n250\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.650\nI want to show you scans.\n\n251\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.690\nIn fact,\nwe don't have any scans present at all.\n\n252\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.100\nWhat if I want to initiate a scan?\n\n253\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.240\nDan just got a call, you know a help desk\nticket that said my computer's not working\n\n254\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.280\nright, something's going on here,\nor maybe he didn't get a call,\n\n255\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.670\nhe wants to be proactive, we want\nto be proactive now that we've seen\n\n256\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.910\na couple of infections happen in\na relatively short period of time.\n\n257\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.510\nWe might wanna just reach out and\ninitiate a scan on that end point.\n\n258\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.500\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that here real quick.\n\n259\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.450\nWe're gonna move on over to\nour administrative center.\n\n260\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.490\nAnd there's a few different ways\nthat you can do this, by the way.\n\n261\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.250\nIf I wanna implement a task, there is,\nand I know it's kinda hard to see,\n\n262\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.500\nwe zoom in there just a little bit.\n\n263\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.730\nYou might be able to see that tasks for\nspecific computers.\n\n264\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.650\nNow I can manually create these tasks,\nnow you might ask yourself,\n\n265\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:18.956\nwhy would I want to do this over let's\nsay, going back to Manage computers and\n\n266\n00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:24.590\nthen right-clicking and\nI can do Create a Task from here.\n\n267\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.940\nWell, remember this is\nease of administration.\n\n268\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.400\nIf I set a task for\n\n269\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.580\nspecific computers here,\nit affects everybody in the group, right?\n\n270\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.580\nSo I've got, maybe it is a worm,\n\n271\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.640\nwe can see it kind of hopping\nthrough the different sub nets.\n\n272\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.120\nWell if I already set,\n\n273\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.410\nyou know, imported my machines based\non an IP sub net, well guess what.\n\n274\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.910\nI can create a task for that IP sub net,\nfire off that command, and\n\n275\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.950\nit hits every one of those computers and\neven the computers that maybe haven't,\n\n276\n00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.610\nwe don't know if they've\nbeen attacked yet, right?\n\n277\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.200\nCuz it's kinda hopping it's way around.\n\n278\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.660\nAnd we can try to clean em up before\nit actually hits those end points.\n\n279\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.550\nBut let's go ahead, I tell you what,\nwe'll create a task here real quick.\n\n280\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.900\nAnd I'm just gonna call\nthis My Update Task.\n\n281\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.020\nAnd we'll just throw one out there.\n\n282\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.750\nAnd a whole bunch of different\ntypes of tasks that you can create.\n\n283\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.740\nAgain, depending on what you need to do,\nI just happen to do an update task.\n\n284\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.430\nMaybe I wanna make sure that at\na certain time all of my computers\n\n285\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.590\non these different sub nets or these\ndifferent groups, do perform an update.\n\n286\n00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.650\nAnd maybe I wanna do it\noff of the peak hours.\n\n287\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.230\nNow, If you were watching in\nthe first episode, or first portion\n\n288\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.200\nof this Kaspersky Center,\n\n289\n00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.220\nSecurity center, excuse me, you'll\nnotice that it did create default tasks.\n\n290\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.180\nSo the default tasks are there and that's\nwhat I'm gonna show you here too, so\n\n291\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.390\nyou do have some in.\n\n292\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.770\nBut you can also create your own as well.\n\n293\n00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.500\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n294\n00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.390\nWe'll do an update task, choose Next.\n\n295\n00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.195\nAll right and, this is gonna ask us\nwhere do we want to update from.\n\n296\n00:15:59.195 --> 00:16:02.503\nIf you're in a heavily and\nmanaged environment,\n\n297\n00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:07.697\none of the things that you might not want\nto happen, right, I can I can see where\n\n298\n00:16:07.697 --> 00:16:13.200\nmaybe there is you don't want all of your\ncomputers going out to the Internet.\n\n299\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.250\nWell, I can point it internally,\nright back to here,\n\n300\n00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.960\nright back to the administrative server\nand say, all these manage computers.\n\n301\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.710\nWe might be under some kind of contract\nthat says we don't want them going out\n\n302\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.260\nthere to the Internet, come back and\n\n303\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.510\ncommunicate with me, or this server if you\nwill, and you can get your updates here.\n\n304\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.300\nBut if that's not the case,\nit could be bandwidth restrictions.\n\n305\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.720\nMaybe you got a slow WAN link.\n\n306\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.540\nMaybe you got a metered WAN link, and\nyou don't wanna chew up that data.\n\n307\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.100\nWe might try\n\n308\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.890\nutilizing the bandwidth internally rather\nthan sending it over the Internet.\n\n309\n00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.680\nBut if that's not the case, you can\nalways say go ahead and connect right\n\n310\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.760\nout to Kaspersky's update service and\npull down the updates from there.\n\n311\n00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.690\nI'm just gonna say point it back here.\n\n312\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.640\nWe'll choose yes.\n\n313\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.145\n>> That would use their bandwidth.\n\n314\n00:16:58.145 --> 00:16:58.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n315\n00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.727\nWe could use their bandwidth for sure,\nand I'll tell you what, if you don't have\n\n316\n00:17:02.727 --> 00:17:05.787\nlike an internal some kind of data cap,\nI would definitely use it.\n\n317\n00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:10.230\nWe can specify the computers for\nselection, and then I can turn around and\n\n318\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.752\nsay, computers with a critical status,\nit's updates.\n\n319\n00:17:13.752 --> 00:17:14.990\nThey got a critical status.\n\n320\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.990\nWe might want them to be updated,\nand then I can specify an account.\n\n321\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:23.020\nNow, earlier, when we deployed this out,\nwe showed you guys how to push this out,\n\n322\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.960\nand we used that administrative account.\n\n323\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.610\nWe don't need to use that\nadministrative account.\n\n324\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.820\nIn fact,\nI would recommend after the installation\n\n325\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.660\ndisabling that administrative account.\n\n326\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.580\nIt's the most powerful\naccount on the system.\n\n327\n00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.100\nJust like you guys out\nthere that use Linux,\n\n328\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.560\nyou know you're not running in route.\n\n329\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.250\nWe want to save that for\nvery, very limited purposes.\n\n330\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.520\nNow that you've got the agent, the agent\ncreated accounts within the machine that\n\n331\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.730\nnow have administrative capabilities, and\n\n332\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.510\nthey're the only ones that\nwill communicate here.\n\n333\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.340\nSo, rather than specify account like I\ndid in the deployment, I'm gonna say,\n\n334\n00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.510\nKaspersky, you've already\nmade your accounts.\n\n335\n00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.780\nYou go ahead and run the show.\n\n336\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.200\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n337\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.490\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nwell how do you want a schedule a start?\n\n338\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.510\nWell, I'm gonna just leave it as Manually.\n\n339\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.770\nSo maybe I come in here and I say,\nI wanna run the task when I wanna run it.\n\n340\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.910\nAnd then I could say, for instance,\n\n341\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.190\nI could put a check mark here that says,\njust go ahead,\n\n342\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.030\nthe moment I finish this wizard,\nfire off that command or that task.\n\n343\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.350\nEverything's a task here.\n\n344\n00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.890\nFire off that task on these computers,\n\n345\n00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.340\nthen again, based on your band width, it's\ngoing to be up to you and what you choose.\n\n346\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.780\nSo fairly easy to create your own tasks,\nbut\n\n347\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.760\nyou can also use the built-in ones because\nit can simplify the administration.\n\n348\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.459\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you where you do that.\n\n349\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.300\nNow you can go to any\none of the computers.\n\n350\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.740\nI can go to our server here,\n\n351\n00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.730\nI could go to the workstation that\nwe've set in place if I wanted to.\n\n352\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.530\nIf I click on the workstation,\nall I have to do is right-click,\n\n353\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.870\nand I can run a task,\nI can choose Properties if I want.\n\n354\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.362\nSo it's kind of like six one,\n\n355\n00:18:52.362 --> 00:18:55.640\nhalf dozen of the others of quite\na few ways that you can do this.\n\n356\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.370\nIf I choose All Tasks,\nI can choose Run a Task, and\n\n357\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.260\nthere's the ones that we've just seen.\n\n358\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.150\nOr I can say,\nI think I'm gonna use the built-in ones.\n\n359\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.680\nAnd let's see is that, oh that's\ngonna take me to the same location,\n\n360\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.820\ngive me a second here, I believe it's\nthe Properties, that's what we want.\n\n361\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.820\nCuz you get a lot more information,\nthere we go, that's what I want.\n\n362\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.510\nSo now I get the name of the computer,\nand I get some more specifics.\n\n363\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.962\nKeep in mind, this is gonna be a little\nbit more of an administrative complexity\n\n364\n00:19:25.962 --> 00:19:28.850\nbecause you're doing this individual\ncomputer by computer, and\n\n365\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.359\nthen I have these tasks over here.\n\n366\n00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:33.733\nAnd so\nyou guys can see that pretty decent there.\n\n367\n00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:36.280\nMaybe, there we go.\n\n368\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.470\nWe've got tasks on the side, and\nall of these are built-in tasks.\n\n369\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.370\nThese are ones that have\nalready been created.\n\n370\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.950\nI haven't done any of this, and\nyou can see there's quite a few here.\n\n371\n00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.130\nSo we're gonna go ahead and what we'll\ndo is initiate a Critical Area Scan.\n\n372\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.145\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose OK.\n\n373\n00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.624\nAnd let's see here, hopefully that ran.\n\n374\n00:19:54.624 --> 00:19:56.122\nI'm going to double-check one more time.\n\n375\n00:20:00.823 --> 00:20:03.650\nAnd Critical Area, we'll try that again.\n\n376\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.980\nOh and you gotta hit the play button, Dan.\n\n377\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.612\nIf you don't hit the play button,\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n378\n00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:10.325\n[LAUGH]\n>> It just kind of sits\n\n379\n00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:10.886\nthere at that point.\n\n380\n00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:11.826\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n381\n00:20:11.826 --> 00:20:14.326\nIt just looks at you and\nsays, no I'm not gonna work,\n\n382\n00:20:14.326 --> 00:20:18.700\nbut don't forget to hit the play button\non the right-hand side there at the top.\n\n383\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.910\nAnd then you can see it's running.\n\n384\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:24.360\nNow one of the good things here is\nif right here from this location,\n\n385\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.180\nif I run this task against\na single computer,\n\n386\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.250\nit's gonna tell me if it's completed or\nif it's completed with errors or not.\n\n387\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.890\nNow it says 38% complete.\n\n388\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.100\nHow do we know that it's even working?\n\n389\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.190\nNow we certainly don't want to go\nover to each individual computer,\n\n390\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.080\nwe've been stressing that pretty heavily.\n\n391\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.970\nDon't go to each computer and find out.\n\n392\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.230\nBut let's just go ahead and\nshow you that that task has started.\n\n393\n00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.408\nWe brought up the logs, we wanna find out.\n\n394\n00:20:50.408 --> 00:20:54.190\nWe've got Scan Tasks down here\nthat's letting us know that hey,\n\n395\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.210\nthere is one running.\n\n396\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.360\nRemember it was blank just\na few minutes ago and\n\n397\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.820\nlook at the context that it's running in.\n\n398\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.731\nRemember one of the things that I have\ntold you is you don't have to create your\n\n399\n00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:05.850\nown, well you don't have to use\nthe default administrative account\n\n400\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.690\nbecause Kaspersky has\nalready done that for us, and\n\n401\n00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.840\nit's running in the context of the system.\n\n402\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.420\nSo you truly can disable that\ndefault administrative account,\n\n403\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.850\nand I would recommend doing that.\n\n404\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.961\nSo Task started and Task complete, so\n\n405\n00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:27.510\nwe can see that it's run its tasks there.\n\n406\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.390\nSo we've reviewed it on the clients side,\nlet's go back and\n\n407\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.860\nsee what the server's telling,\nyep, and there it goes.\n\n408\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.740\nIt tells us it's complete, and if we\nwanna go a little bit farther than that,\n\n409\n00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.580\nwe can go back to our\nManage Computer Section.\n\n410\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.929\nLet me close this down,\nwe'll just cancel out of that.\n\n411\n00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.870\nAnd this will probably update here in\na second, Last update, an hour ago,\n\n412\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.590\nand you can see when was\nthe last time the scan was run.\n\n413\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:59.690\nSo really great information to have,\nyou can push out those scans.\n\n414\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:04.870\nIf it does get infected, you have\nthe ability to see that information,\n\n415\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.130\nand I tell you, Dan,\nwhat do you think we should do?\n\n416\n00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.270\nDo you think we should go ahead and\n\n417\n00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:14.030\ngive this a run for its money and\nsee if it'll quarantine or remediate here?\n\n418\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.371\n>> It would be not worth\nhaving if it couldn't.\n\n419\n00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:17.787\nSo I say what the heck.\n\n420\n00:22:17.787 --> 00:22:19.750\nThrow everything and\nthe kitchen sink at it.\n\n421\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.290\n>> That's right.\n\n422\n00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.350\nSo let's go ahead and do that too.\n\n423\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:28.527\nLet's see if we can put its\nmoney where its mouth is here.\n\n424\n00:22:28.527 --> 00:22:29.362\n>> That's right.\n\n425\n00:22:29.362 --> 00:22:31.410\nIt's a on this computer.\n\n426\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.050\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n427\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.390\n>> A double whammy.\n\n428\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.540\n>> Now guys, keep in mind out there,\nin some of the episodes,\n\n429\n00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.755\nwe've used the Ekor virus strand and\nreally when it comes down to it,\n\n430\n00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:47.150\nI believe this is one that does see that,\nand I could show you that here real quick.\n\n431\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.650\nIt is an industry-wide standard.\n\n432\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.650\nJust be aware that it's not a virus.\n\n433\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.960\nI don't even know if it's going to\neven let it cop it, need permission.\n\n434\n00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.110\nSo yeah, let's try it again, try it again.\n\n435\n00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.240\nNo, it's not gonna let me.\n\n436\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.010\nIt says no longer found.\n\n437\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.470\nSo that quick, it remediated the system.\n\n438\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.570\nIt didn't even let me\ntake that over there.\n\n439\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.530\nSo that's a great thing.\n\n440\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.660\nBut that is just a test, and let's\nput it though a little bit more test.\n\n441\n00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.510\nLet's see if we can infect this system.\n\n442\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.620\nBe careful with this, guys.\n\n443\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.900\nIf you're doing this, one of the things\nthat you're gonna notice here\n\n444\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.010\ndown at the bottom is that I\nhave the network isolated.\n\n445\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.360\nI do have the network isolated here.\n\n446\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.660\nIt doesn't have Internet access, in fact,\n\n447\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.950\nit can't even communicate with the main\nmachine it's running on here, guys.\n\n448\n00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:38.960\nBecause if you're not comfortable\nwith a live virus environment and\n\n449\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.791\nwhat you need to remediate it,\nyou can do a little bit more harm than\n\n450\n00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:48.826\ngood in just your testing, so\nlet's go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n451\n00:23:48.826 --> 00:23:53.023\nAnd right away there, Dan,\nit didn't let it execute at all,\n\n452\n00:23:53.023 --> 00:23:57.865\nit said path not found, and I believe\nthis is one of the ones that tries,\n\n453\n00:23:57.865 --> 00:24:00.643\nand it won't even extract it, in fact.\n\n454\n00:24:00.643 --> 00:24:03.564\n>> I would venture a guess that\nyou would actually have to pause\n\n455\n00:24:03.564 --> 00:24:07.490\nThe Kaspersky protection on the machine\nfor it to actually be able to copy over.\n\n456\n00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.989\n>> Yeah and that's quick.\n\n457\n00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:12.040\nThat's one of the great things,\nI mean, it didn't think about it.\n\n458\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.600\nI mean, it was quick but\nlet's go ahead and take a look locally and\n\n459\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.070\nsee, going back to our reports\nhere on the client side.\n\n460\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.180\nLet's see here.\n\n461\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.410\nAnd I do believe, if we look at events.\n\n462\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.100\nThis is a system audit.\n\n463\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.930\nGuys, I didn't mention this.\n\n464\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:32.400\nThe log that I'm looking at is\nan overall system audit log, which\n\n465\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.510\nincludes things like your licensing, your\nupdates, did the service start or stop?\n\n466\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.400\nSo there's a lot of information in here,\nand you can filter it down.\n\n467\n00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.160\nBut if I scroll down all the way to the\nbottom, one of the things that I should\n\n468\n00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.500\nsee is that it tells me right\naway that malware was detected,\n\n469\n00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.618\ncomponent protection.\n\n470\n00:24:49.618 --> 00:24:55.180\nSo it It did its job, and\nthen what's gonna happen with that\n\n471\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:01.510\nKaspersky network agent is,\nafter a bit the server is gonna reach out,\n\n472\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.645\nand it might be client driven,\nI think it pushes it back.\n\n473\n00:25:04.645 --> 00:25:06.405\nAnd they're gonna communicate either way.\n\n474\n00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:08.775\nThey're gonna communicate together,\nthe server and\n\n475\n00:25:08.775 --> 00:25:11.405\nthe agent that's working\non the workstation itself.\n\n476\n00:25:11.405 --> 00:25:16.939\nAnd it'll update this information for us,\nand then we can come back to our reports.\n\n477\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.550\nWe can look at antivirus statistics and\nit might take a while, a little bit, for\n\n478\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.910\nthis to update.\n\n479\n00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.120\nIt's near real time protection, but\nis good having the real time protection on\n\n480\n00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.020\nmultiple nodes so that you don't\nhave to individually manage them.\n\n481\n00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.180\nLet's go ahead and see what we got here.\n\n482\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.500\nThe same one there.\n\n483\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.480\nOh, there it is and sure enough,\nit's already updated.\n\n484\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.000\nNow, notice how the EICAR test file.\n\n485\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.730\nNotice how it's green.\n\n486\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.570\nVirus is green?\n\n487\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.170\nThat means it's good?\n\n488\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:49.920\nNot really.\n\n489\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.810\nBut the EICAR virus is nothing\nmore than just a hash value that\n\n490\n00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.410\nall the security vendors use just\nto test the real time protections.\n\n491\n00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.170\nSo you can see that it's\nalso got an additional one.\n\n492\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.159\nRemember we had two earlier, now we\nhave three and the EICAR virus stand.\n\n493\n00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:08.827\nAnd again if I want to go\na little bit further than that,\n\n494\n00:26:08.827 --> 00:26:10.280\nI can generate a report here.\n\n495\n00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.613\nAll right, and I can see that notice here,\nit found them,\n\n496\n00:26:16.613 --> 00:26:20.656\nit took care of them,\nit remediated the system.\n\n497\n00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:24.202\nI can see that this was some\nkind of ransomware, and\n\n498\n00:26:24.202 --> 00:26:27.760\nhere's another thing,\nDan, that I really like.\n\n499\n00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.023\nIt tells me the user that was logged in,\nand that's really good.\n\n500\n00:26:31.023 --> 00:26:33.831\nAnd I'm not saying I'm picking\non a specific user, but\n\n501\n00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:37.970\nmaybe your company works with things that\nyou just have to go to websites, right?\n\n502\n00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.730\nIf you're going out, looking at\njob listings, a lot of times these\n\n503\n00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.930\nhackers out there will put bugs on\nthose websites and you download them.\n\n504\n00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.870\nSo it might be something\nwhere you say well,\n\n505\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.470\nmaybe we need to try another\nsolution because this isn't working.\n\n506\n00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:50.850\nAnd at least we know who the user is and\n\n507\n00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.930\nat the same time, we also know\nthat our systems are protected.\n\n508\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.450\n>> Yeah, I've actually had to use that\nlittle piece of information to my benefit\n\n509\n00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:02.710\nbecause users tend to,\ncan be a little bit of their own entity.\n\n510\n00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:03.930\nThey think that they are autonomous.\n\n511\n00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.670\nThey're outside of the realm\nof the IT grasp and\n\n512\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.320\nwe had a virus outbreak\nat a place I worked.\n\n513\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.690\nAnd I called the user because that\ninformation was there in my report.\n\n514\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.470\nAnd I said, hey,\nyour computer has been infected.\n\n515\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.360\nAre you doing something?\n\n516\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.970\nHe goes, oh, well, I opened an e-mail.\n\n517\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.040\nI was like, okay, well,\ndon't open that e-mail again.\n\n518\n00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.150\nActually, delete it, get rid of it.\n\n519\n00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.820\nAnd we actually need to cut off\nyour Internet connectivity.\n\n520\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.070\nOr, what I need you to do is stay off\nyour computer, that's what it was.\n\n521\n00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.610\nAnd he wouldn't listen, and\nhow did I know that he wouldn't listen?\n\n522\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.110\nBecause I kept getting reports generated\nthat he was reinstalling the virus over\n\n523\n00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:41.200\nand over again, and finally we had\nto kill his Internet connectivity so\n\n524\n00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.000\nthat he'd stop spreading\nthe virus around in our company.\n\n525\n00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.220\nI said, we've told you.\n\n526\n00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.880\nWell I can't go without Internet.\n\n527\n00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.850\nWell now you're going without\nInternet because you wouldn't listen.\n\n528\n00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.840\nSo now we have to clean this up and\nremediate this.\n\n529\n00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.360\nSo sometimes getting that information\nis gonna lead you to the culprit and\n\n530\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.360\nnot just the service that it's running\nunder or maybe some virus itself.\n\n531\n00:27:59.360 --> 00:27:59.860\n>> That's right.\n\n532\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.360\nNow we've seen that it's identified them,\nright?\n\n533\n00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.790\nOn the client now, we've seen that it\nwouldn't even allow us to open it.\n\n534\n00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.620\nBut if we're administrators,\nwe can't see that.\n\n535\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.630\nWe're not in front of that computer.\n\n536\n00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.650\nSo how can we verify that\nthere was a remediation?\n\n537\n00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.030\nNot just a quarantine, right?\n\n538\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.330\nA quarantine still has the file there.\n\n539\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.550\nIn some cases,\nin some instances if you will, spyware and\n\n540\n00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.280\nadware might be just\nclassified as a medium risk.\n\n541\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.750\nAnd they quarantine it until\nan administrator can look at it,\n\n542\n00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.180\nverify that hey, this is something\nthat does need to be taken off.\n\n543\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.200\nOr maybe it's an application whitelisting,\nand we need to put an exclusion for it.\n\n544\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.410\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at that and just verify.\n\n545\n00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.020\nRemember earlier here, all we've seen\nis that it detected the virus, right?\n\n546\n00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.430\nAnd then we've seen that information,\nthat it said where it was.\n\n547\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:51.040\nWell if we're in Reports and Notifications\nhere, and I know this is really small and\n\n548\n00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.150\nnot really easy to see, but\nVirus Reports down there at the bottom.\n\n549\n00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.480\nIf I check on that Notice what we get.\n\n550\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.540\nWe get a whole bunch of information.\n\n551\n00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.780\nNow a lot of the information is just\nwhat we've seen in the other interface,\n\n552\n00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.570\nbut this is the one that\nI'm really concerned with.\n\n553\n00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.110\nThe delete, right?\n\n554\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:17.190\nI can see that all of the viruses have\nbeen deleted, and that's the point.\n\n555\n00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.930\nBecause the quarantine is one thing,\nto quarantine them and remediate so\n\n556\n00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.690\nthat you know that the virus\nis no longer there.\n\n557\n00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.280\nThat's where your money's at and\nthat's where the protection lies.\n\n558\n00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.867\nSo it looks like it did\nwhat we needed it to do.\n\n559\n00:29:31.867 --> 00:29:33.290\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n560\n00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.710\nYou can have an overzealous boss.\n\n561\n00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.298\nI know I've had one.\n\n562\n00:29:35.298 --> 00:29:36.072\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n563\n00:29:36.072 --> 00:29:37.819\n>> And he would say, call them up, and\n\n564\n00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:41.084\nrun Malwarebytes, and do this and\nstuff, which if I'm paying for\n\n565\n00:29:41.084 --> 00:29:42.949\nthis product that says it deleted it,\n\n566\n00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:47.060\nI'm gonna trust it deleted it unless I\ncontinually get reports saying it's back.\n\n567\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.970\nOh, it's back again.\n\n568\n00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:48.990\nIt's back again.\n\n569\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.730\nIt's been deleted.\n\n570\n00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.590\nI might see it in the deleted area.\n\n571\n00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.590\nAnd it is deleting it.\n\n572\n00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.850\nBut why is it back?\n\n573\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.850\nMaybe there's a rootkit.\n\n574\n00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:00.410\nMaybe I've got a stubborn user\nthat continually opens emails that\n\n575\n00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:01.510\nhe doesn't know who they came from.\n\n576\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.650\nAnd they have a nice attachment saying\ncheck out this game, it's awesome.\n\n577\n00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.080\nThat might be the way we\nhave to go at that point.\n\n578\n00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.890\nBut if we see that it's deleting it,\nthe software is doing its job.\n\n579\n00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.010\nSo we probably have another problem right?\n\n580\n00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:18.270\nA lot more foundational issues than\nwhatever that one was that it's been able\n\n581\n00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.070\nto delete.\n\n582\n00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:23.430\nSo be able to use that checked out,\nis awesome to have that report at a quick\n\n583\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:28.005\nglance view, see everything that you're\nyour antivirus software is doing for\n\n584\n00:30:28.005 --> 00:30:30.175\nindividuals or groups,\nor whatever you need.\n\n585\n00:30:30.175 --> 00:30:31.510\nSo Wes,\nanything else we need to know about this?\n\n586\n00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.311\n>> No, just as always,\nwe like to end these anti-malware,\n\n587\n00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:38.345\nantivirus on the note that,\nkeep it updated.\n\n588\n00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:41.985\nThere is no reason to have your\nsoftware and have it out of date.\n\n589\n00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:48.325\nYour viruses, and I'm telling them\nto not just call everything a virus,\n\n590\n00:30:48.325 --> 00:30:52.100\nand that's exactly what I'm doing, make\nsure you have your malware definitions.\n\n591\n00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.970\nIf you don't have your malware definitions\nyour software isn't gonna be able to\n\n592\n00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:00.460\nidentify stuff, and it might look\nlike everything is just going fine\n\n593\n00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.190\nwhen in fact you've got a whole bunch\nof malware throughout your network.\n\n594\n00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:08.180\nSo keep them up to date and keep those\nscans running, and you should be good.\n\n595\n00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:08.800\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n596\n00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.200\nWell, thank you so much for showing us how\nto use Kaspersky's Antivirus Solution is\n\n597\n00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.390\na very awesome product.\n\n598\n00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.120\nHopefully you enjoyed\nthis episode as well,\n\n599\n00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.620\nbut it looks like we're going to\ngo ahead and bring it to a close.\n\n600\n00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.590\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n601\n00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.355\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n602\n00:31:21.355 --> 00:31:22.412\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n603\n00:31:22.412 --> 00:31:28.360\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.356\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:22.370\nin this episode we're continuing on with\nour anti-virus, anti-malware series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.060\nHere specifically we're gonna continue\non with the enterprise level type of\n\n6\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.000\nsolutions.\n\n7\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.540\nAnd joining us is one of our\nresident experts, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.840\nWes, welcome to the show today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.450\nHow you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.320\n>> I'm doing great, and Dan,\nit's always good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.550\nThanks for having me back again.\n\n12\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.050\nAnd that's right,\n\n13\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.760\nwe're gonna be moving into something known\nas Trend Micro OfficeScan Enterprise.\n\n14\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.270\nAnd as we continue along remember, we're\ngoing to be looking at the benefits of\n\n15\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.330\nthe enterprise solutions and we're talking\nabout centralized management here.\n\n16\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.296\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right in and\n\n17\n00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:53.745\nlet's see what that\nTrend Micro OfficeScan has for us.\n\n18\n00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:57.375\nNow I've gone ahead already and\nI've downloaded the executable here.\n\n19\n00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.565\nSo when we start this installation,\nkeep in mind that you just connect\n\n20\n00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:04.600\noutbound to their servers and\nyou look for their trial offers.\n\n21\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.900\nAnd you can test this software\nlike we're doing here for\n\n22\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.090\nthis episode without\nhaving to purchase it.\n\n23\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.325\nTo see if it makes it,\n\n24\n00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:14.540\nyou know if it cuts what you need\ninside of your enterprise environment.\n\n25\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.258\nSo with the installation portion of this,\n\n26\n00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:22.324\nyou'll see just normal installation\nprocess for a lot of different software.\n\n27\n00:01:22.324 --> 00:01:26.440\nIt's really no different as far\nas the installation process goes.\n\n28\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.665\nAnd one of the first things it does,\nit just checks and\n\n29\n00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:31.440\nit makes sure the software\nhas maintained its integrity.\n\n30\n00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.030\nNow, the installation on this software\ncould take a little bit because it's gotta\n\n31\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.840\ndo some checks, and it's gotta,\nas it installs different pieces within it.\n\n32\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.660\nYou could say that it might just take\na little bit, so for instance, right now,\n\n33\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.710\nit's extracting the information.\n\n34\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.042\nThe first thing that it does is it checks\nthe integrity of the data package.\n\n35\n00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:51.260\nCuz you gotta keep in mind,\nwhen we've got enterprise software,\n\n36\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.490\nwe don't want bugs in the software\nbefore we even go to install it.\n\n37\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.130\nNow, some of the things\nthat you can see in here,\n\n38\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.935\nthey'll give you what's new in\nthe new product, if you will.\n\n39\n00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.510\nYou've got the support links,\nsystem requirements.\n\n40\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.019\nIf you wanna know what the requirements\nare, they've got jump links here.\n\n41\n00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.060\nAnd that can tell you what you\nneed to have on your server\n\n42\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.290\nas far as hardware goes,\nas far as the operating system.\n\n43\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.289\nBefore you make the choice whether\nyou want to implement this in your\n\n44\n00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.990\nenvironment.\n\n45\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.490\nNow when we start the installation,\n\n46\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.010\nit's got a couple of phases\nthat it goes through.\n\n47\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.170\nThe first phase it's gonna do is it's\ngonna start to prepare the OfficeScan.\n\n48\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.690\nAnd you can see that again,\njust a normal point and click wizard.\n\n49\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.503\nAnd we're just gonna go ahead and\nchoose Next.\n\n50\n00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:35.600\nOne of the first things that we do is,\nwe accept the EULA, right?\n\n51\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.580\nNot much different than some of the other\npieces of software that we've seen.\n\n52\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.220\nNow, what's really cool is it's gonna\nask you, where do you want to upgrade or\n\n53\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.180\ndo your installation?\n\n54\n00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.010\nSo you can see right here it's telling me,\nOn this endpoint or,\n\n55\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.040\nOn one or more remote endpoints.\n\n56\n00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.170\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ninstall this here on our server.\n\n57\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.510\nAnother cool thing, too.\n\n58\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.140\nPrior to it installing, it's gonna say,\ndo you want me to check that endpoint and\n\n59\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.300\nmake sure that it's protected\nbefore I install this software?\n\n60\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.390\nSo it kind of protects itself before\nit even starts to install the software.\n\n61\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.072\nSo we'll go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n62\n00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:14.470\nAll right, and now what it's gonna do,\nit's gonna go through its first phase\n\n63\n00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.630\nof the installation, and depending on,\nyou know, the power of your server.\n\n64\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.600\nIt could take a little bit for\nthis installation to start and finish.\n\n65\n00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.700\nBut we still have a few more things that\nwe're gonna have to configure after this.\n\n66\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.660\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll get the first\nphase started here and initiated.\n\n67\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.890\nSo that process is finished and\nnow we're ready to start the installation.\n\n68\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.075\n>> Well, hold on there Wes.\n\n69\n00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:42.150\n[LAUGH] You just told us that we\nwere starting the installation and\n\n70\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.620\nnow we're starting the installation again?\n\n71\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.966\n>> That's right, so this is phase\ntwo of the installation, part B.\n\n72\n00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:51.500\n[LAUGH] So now what we do in\nthis part of the installation.\n\n73\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.705\nWhat we're gonna do is tell\nthe Trend Micro OfficeScan,\n\n74\n00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:57.122\nwhat is the location of the installation.\n\n75\n00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:59.440\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust do Next on this.\n\n76\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.310\nAnd if you're using a proxy server you\ncan set those settings right here.\n\n77\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.380\nNow, I haven't been using the proxy\nserver so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n78\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.970\nI'm gonna leave this blank.\n\n79\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.680\nAnd we'll walk through.\n\n80\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.085\nNow, if you already have a web\nserver that you wanna use\n\n81\n00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:17.910\nwith the Trend Micro OfficeScan\nyou can point it to that.\n\n82\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.190\nYou can also use the on-board Apache\nserver and it'll set it up for you and\n\n83\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.700\nthen you don't have to interact\nwith it if you don't want to.\n\n84\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.010\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n85\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.910\nIf you have any other\nspecific ports you know,\n\n86\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.281\nin the register port range that might you\nthink, maybe might conflict with this.\n\n87\n00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.210\nIf you're using other\nports you can change it,\n\n88\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.100\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave the defaults here.\n\n89\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.970\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n90\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.975\nNow it's gonna ask us,\nhow do we want to identify the server?\n\n91\n00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:46.901\nAnd the majority of the time,\nyour servers,\n\n92\n00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.785\nyou give them static IP addresses, right?\n\n93\n00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:51.255\nYou don't want your IP addresses\non your servers changing.\n\n94\n00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:54.734\nAnd that's one of the things they say,\nif you do expect for\n\n95\n00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:57.150\nwhatever reason that it's using DHCP.\n\n96\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.120\nYou might want to go with a server\nname instead of the IP address,\n\n97\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.002\nbecause obviously, that'll change.\n\n98\n00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:07.002\nHowever, the majority of the time, we have\nstatic IP addresses on our servers, and\n\n99\n00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:07.842\nwe can go by IP.\n\n100\n00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:11.272\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and leave it\nwith the FQDN here, and we'll choose Next.\n\n101\n00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:14.952\nNow, you can do product\nactivation if you want.\n\n102\n00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:16.662\nYou could register it right now.\n\n103\n00:05:16.662 --> 00:05:21.182\nThe option is also that you can skip\nthis if you have an activation code, and\n\n104\n00:05:21.182 --> 00:05:23.030\nyou can type the activation code.\n\n105\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.660\nWell, I have an activation code,\nso we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n106\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.760\nwe're gonna input that.\n\n107\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.900\nSo we'll choose Next.\n\n108\n00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.730\nAll right, now,\nwhen it comes to the activation code,\n\n109\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.460\nyou can get that right from Trend Micro.\n\n110\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.904\nAnd they'll typically email this to you,\n\n111\n00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:43.696\nto start your free subscription,\nor your trial download.\n\n112\n00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.979\nAnd then we can just enter\nthat information there.\n\n113\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.150\nAnd you'll see that it enters it in the\nother fields too, and we'll choose Next.\n\n114\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.890\nAnd it lets me know how long\nthe activation code is good for.\n\n115\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.430\nNow, this one has already been used, so\n\n116\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.940\nyou can see it doesn't look like\nthere's that much time left on it.\n\n117\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.560\nAgain because I've already used this one.\n\n118\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.510\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose OK to that.\n\n119\n00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.600\nAnd it lets us know\nwhen it's gonna expire,\n\n120\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.640\nwhich is good, for\nall the three different options there.\n\n121\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.588\nAnd then it tells us about\nthe agent deployment, right?\n\n122\n00:06:15.588 --> 00:06:19.043\nThe conventional scan method,\nthe size, the web installation,\n\n123\n00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:22.880\nwhat the size is there so\nyou can get some information about that.\n\n124\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.560\nWe could choose Next.\n\n125\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.240\nNow, if you're using the integrated\nserver it's gonna ask you to set up SSL.\n\n126\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.280\nNow, you don't really have, when I say set\nup SSL this is really all you have to do.\n\n127\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.350\nYes, integrated Smart Protection Server\nis gonna use your reputation based scans,\n\n128\n00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.570\nand we want your agents that connect\nyour work stations the agent's run on.\n\n129\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.228\nWhen they connect to the server,\nthey need to be able to trust it.\n\n130\n00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:51.100\nSo, it's gonna use SSL there, and we\ndon't have to worry about setting up SSL,\n\n131\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.800\nif we don't want to.\n\n132\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.710\nThere's the ports that\nthe Web Reputation Services are gonna use,\n\n133\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.190\nto check files and viruses.\n\n134\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.956\nMore so to see processes and\nstuff and see if they're reputable.\n\n135\n00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:06.983\nAnd it's not some kind of virus\ntrying to throw a hook in there and\n\n136\n00:07:06.983 --> 00:07:09.420\nmaliciously infect your system.\n\n137\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.230\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Next to that.\n\n138\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.218\nNow, one of the things that this one does,\n\n139\n00:07:14.218 --> 00:07:18.715\nis it allows the OfficeScan\nagent to install on the server.\n\n140\n00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:20.465\nAnd that's what it's\nletting us know right now.\n\n141\n00:07:20.465 --> 00:07:21.105\nIt's letting us know,\n\n142\n00:07:21.105 --> 00:07:25.425\ndo you want to install the OfficeScan\nagent on the target endpoint?\n\n143\n00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:26.175\nIn this case,\n\n144\n00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:30.363\nthe target end point isn't a remote\ncomputer that we're pushing this out yet.\n\n145\n00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:32.015\nIt's gonna be on this server itself.\n\n146\n00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:34.030\nSo we'll go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n147\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.350\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n148\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.320\nNow there's a lot of, remember,\nmost of this software here,\n\n149\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.560\nyou send statistical data out, right?\n\n150\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.448\nAnd it collects information so\nthey can be aware of viruses, and malware,\n\n151\n00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:50.550\nand those zero-day exploits.\n\n152\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.227\nYou know, we want to be aware of this.\n\n153\n00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:55.683\nSo this information helps\nthings like heuristic scans and\n\n154\n00:07:55.683 --> 00:08:00.420\nthose reputation services, so it is a good\nidea to go ahead and Opt-in to that.\n\n155\n00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.351\nYou can opt-in to it or opt-out of it.\n\n156\n00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:05.430\nI would recommend opting-in to it.\n\n157\n00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.060\nNow, the next thing that we do is\nset-up our route user password.\n\n158\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.340\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna type the password, and\n\n159\n00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.370\nI wanna show you something here.\n\n160\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.340\nNow this is gonna be done on purpose,\nbecause the other thing\n\n161\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.780\nis the OfficeScan agent unload and\nuninstall password.\n\n162\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.770\nBecause, remember, enterprise level\ntechnologies centralized administration,\n\n163\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.490\nyou want your server admins\nto be a part of this.\n\n164\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.540\nThis means that somebody that\nis sitting at that work station,\n\n165\n00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.290\nthey're gonna have to have\nthis password that you put in,\n\n166\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.210\nto be able to uninstall\nthe Trend Micro on the endpoint side.\n\n167\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.480\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nput the same password as the web console,\n\n168\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.560\nwhich is the management interface\nthat it's gonna create,\n\n169\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.010\njust to generate this error\nthat you're gonna see.\n\n170\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.280\nAnd it's more of a warning\nthan it is an error.\n\n171\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.010\nThere we go.\n\n172\n00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.180\nYep, so it generated it.\n\n173\n00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.600\nYou'll see that Trend Micro says,\ndon't use the same password, right?\n\n174\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.130\nRemember, separation of duties, you don't\nwant somebody to have too much power, so\n\n175\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.400\nyou might have somebody that's in control.\n\n176\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.860\nMaybe a junior admin,\nwho knows, that's in control of\n\n177\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.010\nuninstalling from machines that maybe\nyou're servicing for whatever reason.\n\n178\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.150\nSo it recommends changing the password.\n\n179\n00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.100\nSo I'll go ahead and\nwe'll do their recommendations here and\n\n180\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.650\nwe'll keep those passwords unique.\n\n181\n00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:30.530\nAll right and\nwe'll move along in the installation.\n\n182\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.360\nNow the next thing we talk about is,\nwhat security level do you want on this?\n\n183\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.070\nAnd the installation path and you could\nsee the high level versus the normal.\n\n184\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.738\nWhich again,\nthis grants everybody permissions, and\n\n185\n00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:49.853\nthat might not be what you want.\n\n186\n00:09:49.853 --> 00:09:55.007\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and leave that\nto the defaults too, we'll choose next.\n\n187\n00:09:55.007 --> 00:09:58.880\nAnd Tend Micro OfficeScan also\ncomes with it's own firewall.\n\n188\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.930\nSo it's asking you,\ndo you wanna enable the firewall?\n\n189\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.430\nKeep in mind that if you're on Windows\nsystems, obviously, well any system\n\n190\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.280\nreally, you're not going to be able to\nrun two firewalls at the same time.\n\n191\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.430\nSo it's up to you whether\nyou enable this or not.\n\n192\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.580\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n193\n00:10:14.485 --> 00:10:19.724\nNow, the other thing that we\nhave to worry about is things\n\n194\n00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:27.635\nlike applications that might be flagged\nas maybe being spyware, or being malware.\n\n195\n00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:31.705\nSo this actually goes into\nassessment mode, and it can learn,\n\n196\n00:10:31.705 --> 00:10:36.485\nover a period of time, whether it's\nspyware, whether it's grayware,\n\n197\n00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:40.665\nwhether it's evaluating that information\nand finding out that it's not that at all.\n\n198\n00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:43.555\nSo you can say, yes,\nI wanna enable assessment mode, or\n\n199\n00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:45.795\nno I don't wanna enable assessment mode.\n\n200\n00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:46.985\nWe're gonna go ahead and enable it.\n\n201\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.600\nAll right.\n\n202\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.370\nAnd then we're going to enable the web\nreputation policy as well, here.\n\n203\n00:10:57.767 --> 00:10:58.710\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n204\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.440\nLet me go ahead and\njust stay with this one just for a second.\n\n205\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.550\nWhen you connect to a URL the web\nreputation policy, if it's enabled, if\n\n206\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.510\nOffice Scan checks with the web reputation\nservice out there at Trend Micro and\n\n207\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.460\nit comes back and it says hey,\nthis url is known for a fishing scam or\n\n208\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:23.370\nit's known for downloading software\nthat's malicious to computers.\n\n209\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.240\nIf you don't enable this then it's\nnot going to warn you on that so\n\n210\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.359\nwe're gonna go ahead and say yes to this.\n\n211\n00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:31.970\nAll right.\n\n212\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.320\nAnd then the next thing\nthat we're gonna do is,\n\n213\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.650\nwe're gonna create\nan authentication certificate and\n\n214\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.980\nwe're gonna confirm the back up password.\n\n215\n00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:46.450\nAll right, just in case\nsomething happens to our server.\n\n216\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.730\nAnd here's where we tell it is it the\nfolder name, what do you want to name it?\n\n217\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.410\nNow, I kind of take the name\nof the server off of there.\n\n218\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.640\nThat's just me.\n\n219\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.010\nYou can leave it on there if you want.\n\n220\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.700\nAnd I choose next.\n\n221\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.180\nAnd now, we go through the install,\nphase two portion, here.\n\n222\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.762\nNow, this, depending on, again,\nthe power of the server.\n\n223\n00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:11.630\nDepending on what you have in there,\nas far as resources.\n\n224\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.690\nThis could take a fairly long time,\ncuz it's going to connect outbound.\n\n225\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.810\nSo depending on how long it takes\nyou might just be sitting back and\n\n226\n00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:26.840\nwaiting here for a little bit before\nthe software itself finishes installing.\n\n227\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.415\nSaved a little time for\nus on the installation.\n\n228\n00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.925\nCan take a while here, so\nI've got a machine that's ready to go.\n\n229\n00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:35.705\nThe trend micro office scan\ninstallation is finished and\n\n230\n00:12:35.705 --> 00:12:38.855\nwhat it did was it put a shortcut,\nan icon to Internet Explorer.\n\n231\n00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:42.075\nWhich is going to be the web console that\nwe're gonna use in order to configure\n\n232\n00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:43.205\nthis server.\n\n233\n00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:47.530\nNow, some of the things that you have to\ndo, you'll see right here that it says\n\n234\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.620\nthere's a problem with this\nwebsite security certificate.\n\n235\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:55.040\nAnd that's because this web\nserver doesn't have it's\n\n236\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.270\nroot certification down there in\nour certificate store there so\n\n237\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.710\nit's letting us know this\nis a bogus certificate.\n\n238\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.000\nI wouldn't worry about that.\n\n239\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.370\nBut one of the things I\nwould tell you to do.\n\n240\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.960\nAnd specially on the servers the fact\nthat this URL isn't trusted.\n\n241\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.960\nI would go over it and take the time and\ngo into your Internet options.\n\n242\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.390\nGo to your security zones and in your\nsites I would make sure that you put\n\n243\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.170\nthis website in the trusted site zone\nsince you know that you trust it.\n\n244\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.900\nI certainly wouldn't do this with any\npublic site that says don't go to it.\n\n245\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.860\nBut since we know this is part of\nthe web server, it's gonna make it so\n\n246\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.100\nthat you can see all of the content that's\ngoing to be displayed in the web browser,\n\n247\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.530\nin the web console here.\n\n248\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.940\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsay continue to this website.\n\n249\n00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.440\nRemember that we set the password, and\nthat's what we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n250\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.100\nthe username and the password,\nit defaults to root.\n\n251\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.350\nAnd then you set your password.\n\n252\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.170\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlogin to the interface.\n\n253\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.390\nNow with the interface here.\n\n254\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.640\nIt's relatively simplistic.\n\n255\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.690\nIt's not really too difficult, but\none of the things you'll see first of all\n\n256\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.980\nis antivirus agent connectivity, and we\ncan see that there are some here already.\n\n257\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.200\nWe can see that there's one offline.\n\n258\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.940\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n259\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.280\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna push\nthis installation out to another machine.\n\n260\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.380\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n261\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.650\nTo do this you're gonna go over to\nAgents > and then Agent Installation.\n\n262\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:18.810\nNow the cool thing about this,\n\n263\n00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.150\nyou've got a few different types\nof how you want to install this.\n\n264\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.430\nYou can do it browser-based.\n\n265\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.020\nYou could do it through a UNC path,\nyou can do a remote installation,\n\n266\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.050\nwhich is the one we're gonna use, and\nit's also got a tools option there too.\n\n267\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:36.340\nSo let's go ahead and\ngo to Agents > Agent Installation, and\n\n268\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.835\nwe're gonna do a remote installation.\n\n269\n00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:40.125\nNow it takes a second here.\n\n270\n00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.945\nAnd what it's gonna do is,\nit's gonna look at the Internet.\n\n271\n00:14:42.945 --> 00:14:47.045\nIt's gonna say can we find\nany endpoints out there?\n\n272\n00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:53.470\nNow, if you don't find an endpoint, now\nit's finding some here, but, I would say\n\n273\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.720\nif it doesn't find an end point make sure\nthat network discovery is turned on.\n\n274\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.860\nRemember, network discovery\nis what your Windows machine.\n\n275\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.990\nIf you're in another operating\nsystem you don't have to worry.\n\n276\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.540\nBut it's what Windows machines use to\nfind other machines on the network.\n\n277\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.020\nAnd you can see our\nWindows 7 install here.\n\n278\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.730\nWe can choose add.\n\n279\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.940\nAnd now it asks us for\na Username and Password.\n\n280\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.700\nLike some of the other\nsoftware that we've seen,\n\n281\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.010\nwe have to tell it what Username\nare you gonna allow to connect this to.\n\n282\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.410\nIf you're in a domain environment,\n\n283\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.200\nprobably you're gonna be using\nsome kind of domain administrator.\n\n284\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.370\nBut here we're gonna use\nthe local administrator.\n\n285\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.070\n>> Now Wes what will we do if we had maybe\nsome of our PC's that aren't allowed for\n\n286\n00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.870\nwhatever various reasons to\nnot use network discovery?\n\n287\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.290\nAre we able to find them as well?\n\n288\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.610\nIs there a different way to do that?\n\n289\n00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.530\n>> It could hinder that.\n\n290\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.510\nWhat you would do in that case is you\nwould create an install package and\n\n291\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.940\nat this point you might be using\nsomething like Sneaker Net.\n\n292\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.240\nAnd a thumb drive.\n\n293\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.894\nDefinitely not gonna be something\nyou wanna do on a large scale.\n\n294\n00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:52.393\nBut if you do have a handful of computers\nthat are completely managed, and\n\n295\n00:15:52.393 --> 00:15:54.313\nlike Dan said, for security purposes,\n\n296\n00:15:54.313 --> 00:15:57.643\nand you don't want anybody else to\nknow where they are in the network,\n\n297\n00:15:57.643 --> 00:16:01.101\nThen it might be a that point where\nyou might use the web based interface.\n\n298\n00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:03.650\nYou might say, okay,\nwe're gonna use the web based interface.\n\n299\n00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.330\nOr we're going to use the UNC path,\n\n300\n00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.730\nbecause then at that point\nyou really don't have to\n\n301\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:12.520\nturn on network discovery cuz you're using\nother methods to finish the installation.\n\n302\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.950\nAll right so let's go ahead and\n\n303\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.880\nI'll see if I can type administrator here,\nso far so good.\n\n304\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.485\nAnd what's really cool about the software\nis the fact that it's going to try\n\n305\n00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:26.940\nto communicate out with that machine but\n\n306\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.520\nfind out, hey is this truly,\ncan I use this account?\n\n307\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.000\nRemember it's gonna require a local\nadministrative account in order to\n\n308\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.750\ncomplete the installation and\nbe able to deploy it.\n\n309\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.760\nNow, it takes a second here, because\nit's reaching out over the network, and\n\n310\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.410\nit's trying to communicate\nwith that end point.\n\n311\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.410\nAnd once it does,\nyou'll notice it says install,\n\n312\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:54.040\nor we got Windows 7 install machine, which\nis our demo machine, and what I can do is,\n\n313\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.540\nI can scroll down here to the bottom,\nand I can choose install.\n\n314\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.650\nNow, one of the things\nthat it's gonna do is,\n\n315\n00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.870\nit's gonna say, all right are you\nsure you wanna continue this process?\n\n316\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.370\nWe say yes, and we can see over here\nthat it says that it is installing.\n\n317\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.880\nSo let's go ahead, let's switch over\nour machine, and let's find out.\n\n318\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.858\nIs it really doing what we want it to do?\n\n319\n00:17:13.858 --> 00:17:20.697\nNow, we've looked a couple of different\nlocations for our install process, right?\n\n320\n00:17:20.697 --> 00:17:24.051\nWe've looked at,\nsome are in the temporary folder.\n\n321\n00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:28.680\nI think it's Symantic has the client\ninstall in the temporary directory.\n\n322\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:36.460\nYou'll see that Kaspersky uses the Program\nFiles x86, you might've seen right there.\n\n323\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.886\nWe have a remote install file pops up,\nand now we have a couple more.\n\n324\n00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:42.650\nIf I double click this,\n\n325\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:48.470\nyou can see it's using that OSCE temp and\nan information collector.\n\n326\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.790\nNow this information collector is\ndoing exactly what it looks like.\n\n327\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.390\nThis exe is specific to the TrendMicro\nOfficeScan, and it's gathering,\n\n328\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.170\njust like it sounds.\n\n329\n00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.980\nIt creates an executable, and I believe\nyou can even see that executable down here\n\n330\n00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.780\nin the Windows Temp Directory if\nI navigate to that real quick.\n\n331\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.770\nI think you can see it down here,\nthere we go, yep.\n\n332\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.630\nAnd you can see that this is some\ninformation that it's using right\n\n333\n00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.948\nnow to perform it's installation.\n\n334\n00:18:12.948 --> 00:18:18.320\nAll right, so when we go with the install,\nthat's really the only verification.\n\n335\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.100\nAt least at this point, that the install\nis happening, it's happening\n\n336\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.780\nappropriately, is through that, these\ncouple of files that you can see here.\n\n337\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.505\nI got a configuration file, we open that.\n\n338\n00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:32.989\nYou can see that it's telling\nus that we've got a successful,\n\n339\n00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:37.131\nat least a successful start to the\ninstallation, a couple other things you\n\n340\n00:18:37.131 --> 00:18:42.018\ncould do too, you could see OfficeScan,\nthe OfficeScan agent, it's already there.\n\n341\n00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:47.640\nIt didn't take too long, it, if we open it\nup here, we can see, and it takes a little\n\n342\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.380\nbit to go through the process, just like\nsome of the other ones that we've seen.\n\n343\n00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.010\nOne of the things that\nyou'll notice is that\n\n344\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.220\nAction Center is gonna kinda\nbalk at you a little bit.\n\n345\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.590\nIt's gonna say, well wait a second here,\nyou need to turn on Windows Defender,\n\n346\n00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.880\nsomething's going on.\n\n347\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.910\nKeep in mind, just like the other\nantivirus and anti malware software\n\n348\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.760\nthat we've been talking about,\nthey don't play nice together, right?\n\n349\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.410\nSo, when you give it the administrative\ncapabilities over this machine,\n\n350\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.670\nit's going to reach down there and\nI can't even do a scan right now.\n\n351\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.630\nThat's one of the things\nyou can notice too,\n\n352\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.740\nit's not allowing you to do a scan yet\ncuz it's still installing.\n\n353\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.790\nAnd I believe we can go to the logs,\nand system logs are in here.\n\n354\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.410\nAnd we don't have any scan operations\ngoing on yet, but at least we can see from\n\n355\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.912\nthis standpoint that we do have\nthe installations happening.\n\n356\n00:19:37.912 --> 00:19:40.980\nAll right, and we've got a couple\nof options right here too.\n\n357\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.775\nYou can see that have behavior monitoring,\nthat turned on immediately.\n\n358\n00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:47.805\nThey don't waste time\nwith some of this stuff.\n\n359\n00:19:47.805 --> 00:19:50.085\nReal time scan is on and\n\n360\n00:19:50.085 --> 00:19:54.565\nwe're gonna set some polices coming up\nto do some configuration on this client.\n\n361\n00:19:54.565 --> 00:19:58.820\nYou can see that data loss protection\nis on, suspicious connection service,\n\n362\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.020\nwhich is really cool.\n\n363\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.016\nOutbreak protection and the firewall,\nwe can do web reputation.\n\n364\n00:20:05.016 --> 00:20:09.300\nWe're gonna see this coming up in some\nof the policies that we can create and\n\n365\n00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.980\nhow we can push out these scans\nin order to configure the client.\n\n366\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.421\nSo you know Dan, when it comes down to it,\nit is another one of those ones it\n\n367\n00:20:17.421 --> 00:20:21.308\nreally isn't too difficult and\nit's fairly transparent.\n\n368\n00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:23.390\nAnd I'm kinda surprised\nthat it didn't let us,\n\n369\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.380\nit didn't tell us that we need to\nworry about Windows Defender here.\n\n370\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.270\nBut it does let us know, find an antivirus\nprogram online, and let me go ahead and\n\n371\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.720\nclose that down real quick.\n\n372\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.781\nI wanna show you guys\nthe action center here.\n\n373\n00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:39.980\nAnd most of these software,\nwhen you deploy to the endpoint,\n\n374\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.584\na lot of times, they're out of date.\n\n375\n00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:47.499\nAll right and they need to be updated,\nso yeah, it's not finding it yet,\n\n376\n00:20:47.499 --> 00:20:49.180\nbut it will here in a bit.\n\n377\n00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.800\nAnd one of the things it'll come back and\n\n378\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.590\ntell us is that, hey this is out of\ndate and it needs to be updated.\n\n379\n00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.340\nSo kind of a cool solution and\nit's really, really easy to set up.\n\n380\n00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.430\nIt let's us know that there were\nnotifications sent and they were received.\n\n381\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.962\nAnd we can go back to our dashboard, and\n\n382\n00:21:05.962 --> 00:21:09.690\nit'll take a little bit to\nupdate the dashboard here.\n\n383\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.505\nJust like it does, remember guys web\ninterface that agent has to get,\n\n384\n00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:16.340\nit's actually already, let's see here.\n\n385\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.905\nLooks like it's already there,\nyep, sure enough.\n\n386\n00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:21.822\n>> Don't you dare underestimate it.\n\n387\n00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.168\n>> Don't underestimate it, right?\n\n388\n00:21:23.168 --> 00:21:28.910\nThat's right, so it tells us already\nthat it's there, Windows 7 install.\n\n389\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.470\nIt's not activated,\nit hasn't finished the process right now.\n\n390\n00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.220\nSo it's letting us know\nthat we'll probably have to\n\n391\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.270\ncome back and look at that.\n\n392\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.030\nSo we can look at the status here.\n\n393\n00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:43.080\nAnd if I expand that out, there we go,\nwe can get some information on it.\n\n394\n00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.650\nWe can see that smartscan, it's on.\n\n395\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.930\nThe connection status, it's online,\nso we can communicate with it.\n\n396\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.980\nLets me know its MAC address,\nlets me know the last startup.\n\n397\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.500\nSo, we get some pretty quick\ninformation right off the top here,\n\n398\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.710\nwhile it finishes its install process.\n\n399\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.070\nAnd, we've deployed it to the endpoint.\n\n400\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.220\n>> Not too difficult really.\n\n401\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.472\nWe've seen a basic trend here,\neven with TrendMicro.\n\n402\n00:22:09.472 --> 00:22:12.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No pun intended to be honest with you.\n\n403\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.860\nThat these managers, they should be pretty\nstraight forward to get installed, right?\n\n404\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.790\nWe saw it with Symantic, we saw it\nwith Kaspersky, we're seeing it here.\n\n405\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.865\nAnd we did have a little longer of\nan installation period, but it seems like\n\n406\n00:22:22.865 --> 00:22:26.750\nTrendMicro was worried a little more about\nsecurity during the installation than\n\n407\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.190\nthe other products were, and that's great,\nthat's fine, maybe that's exactly the kind\n\n408\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.410\nof product you're looking for and\ntrend micro is filling that void, right?\n\n409\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.470\nIt is being that player in the game.\n\n410\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.360\nNow Wes, is there anything else about this\nenterprise management solution, I mean,\n\n411\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.140\nobviously it's pretty simple to get it\ndeployed, you find your endpoints, and\n\n412\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.260\nyou start shoveling out\nclients to these guys, right?\n\n413\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.530\n>> Yeah,\nwhat we've really gone through, guys,\n\n414\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.130\nis the basic, just a remote deployment.\n\n415\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:58.140\nThere's a lot that this software can do,\nmonitoring, logging, updating,\n\n416\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.968\nsetting policies, one of the big things\nis just make sure you keep it up to date.\n\n417\n00:23:02.968 --> 00:23:04.700\nIf you're gonna push out the antivirus,\nand\n\n418\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.470\nwe're going to show you how to do this,\nyou make sure you update the end points.\n\n419\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.240\nMake sure that you\nare running scans on them.\n\n420\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.120\nAnd like Dan said, one of the things\nthat is pretty cool about\n\n421\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.540\nthe TrendMicro installation process,\nis it is a long installation process but\n\n422\n00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.060\nthe first half of it is checking\nthe integrity of their software.\n\n423\n00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.790\nSo, the installer process says hey,\nlet me look at that software.\n\n424\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.991\nlet me make sure that it's a It's\nmaintained its integrity, it hasn't been\n\n425\n00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:32.261\nmodified, it hasn't been damaged,\nit doesn't mean maliciously, right?\n\n426\n00:23:32.261 --> 00:23:35.584\nNetwork communications fail all the time,\nit's one of the reasons we use\n\n427\n00:23:35.584 --> 00:23:39.229\nreliable connection oriented protocols,\nbut it makes sure that it's intact so\n\n428\n00:23:39.229 --> 00:23:41.640\nthat when it installs you\ndon't have a corruption and\n\n429\n00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.640\nthen have to uninstall it and\nreinstall it.\n\n430\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.610\nSo a fairly long installation process but\nonce we set it we\n\n431\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:53.620\ncan let it go, and after an hour or\ntwo and quite a few cups of coffee,\n\n432\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.420\nit's not really an hour or\ntwo it's only about 15 or 20 minutes.\n\n433\n00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.750\nAfter that's set up you got your\nadministration console ready to go and\n\n434\n00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.160\nyou can start pushing out\nthe software at your endpoints.\n\n435\n00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.040\n>> Well Wes it definitely sounds like\nthere's plenty of meat left on that bone\n\n436\n00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.910\nfor part two When it comes to Trend Micro\nso looks like we'll have to go into that\n\n437\n00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:13.380\ncuz I'm taking a look at the clock and\nit is winding down fast.\n\n438\n00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.610\nSo, any parting words of wisdom\nbefore we close the show.\n\n439\n00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.630\n>> No, I think that's got it.\n\n440\n00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.240\n>> All right, well Wes thank you so\nmuch for that demonstration.\n\n441\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.490\nAnd thank you guys for watching, we're\ngonna go ahead and sign of for ITProTV.\n\n442\n00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.040\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrey.\n\n443\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.905\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n444\n00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:28.124\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n445\n00:24:28.124 --> 00:24:34.280\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.450\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.180\nin today's episode, we are taking a look\nat, well, antivirus and anti-malware.\n\n6\n00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.310\nAnd joining us in the studio today,\none of our resident experts on that topic.\n\n7\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.980\nNone other than Mr. Wesley Bryant.\n\n8\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.000\nWes, welcome to the show how\nare you doing today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.910\n>> I'm doing okay man.\n\n10\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.610\nThanks for having me back as always and\n\n11\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.440\nthat's right we're gonna be moving\non in our Enterprise Solutions.\n\n12\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.220\nAnd this is our part two on the Trend\nMicro Office Scan Enterprise edition.\n\n13\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.710\nNow we've already deployed our software,\n\n14\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.880\nwe've got our administration\nserver all set up and ready to go.\n\n15\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.350\nAnd we've already deployed to the end\npoint the anti-virus software here.\n\n16\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.630\nSo what we're gonna show you in this\nepisode is how you can monitor, manage and\n\n17\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.885\nmaintain those end points.\n\n18\n00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:01.890\nCuz remember, one of the things that sets\nour Enterprise Solutions apart from most\n\n19\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.160\nconsumer grade solutions is the fact\nthat we get the centralized management.\n\n20\n00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.910\nBecause you really don't wanna be going\nfrom computer to computer to computer when\n\n21\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.210\nyou could potentially scale up\nto past 5,000 computers or more.\n\n22\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.950\nOr even have things like worldwide\n\n23\n00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.850\nnetworks where you have to distribute\nantivirus on a massive scale.\n\n24\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.150\nSo let's go ahead and let's look\nat our OfficeScan interface here.\n\n25\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.130\nNow when you're going\nto manage your devices,\n\n26\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.290\none of the things that you need to do is,\nyou can do this in a couple of ways.\n\n27\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.980\nI'm gonna show you both of\nthese different ways here too.\n\n28\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.560\nThe first place is on the dashboard,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.360\nThe dashboard,\nyou'll see this little online status.\n\n30\n00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.950\nLet's see if we can zoom in there.\n\n31\n00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.150\nAll right, there we go.\n\n32\n00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.550\nOnline is exactly what it means.\n\n33\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.760\nIt means that when the computer,\nthe workstation, boots up,\n\n34\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.370\nit communicates with the agent out\nto the administration server and\n\n35\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.640\nthe administrative server is aware\nthat that computer is online.\n\n36\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.010\nNow you can see that we have\na couple of computers online here.\n\n37\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.410\nOne is the administration server itself,\nand the other one was the client\n\n38\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.140\nthat we installed in the previous\npart one of this episode.\n\n39\n00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.840\nNow this is the Agent Management location.\n\n40\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.720\nGuess what?\n\n41\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.800\nIf I go to the dashboard again I can\nalso go to Agent Management as well.\n\n42\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.950\nSo from the dropdown list just\na couple of different way,\n\n43\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.630\nthat's one of the good things about\nthese administration servers.\n\n44\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.790\nCouple of different ways,\n\n45\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.510\nwell quite a few different ways\nto get to the same location.\n\n46\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.320\nBut the dashboard,\nkeep in mind gives you a heads up view\n\n47\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.560\nincluding things like\nthreat events as well.\n\n48\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.400\nBut you already know that\nyou're gonna manage a specific\n\n49\n00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760\ncomputer you might just want to go to\nthe Agent Management section here.\n\n50\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.140\n>> Now Wes I notice you keep calling,\nor Trend Micro calls it Agent.\n\n51\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.900\nThis is our client's piece of software.\n\n52\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.740\nI know that in Kaspersky and I think\neven Symantec, they call them agent,\n\n53\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.090\nit's a little connection software.\n\n54\n00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.320\nAnd then there's the client, but\n\n55\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010\nthis is the client kind of\nall in one thing, right?\n\n56\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.840\n>> It really is, and\nthat's a good point too, Dan.\n\n57\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.380\nDon't confuse the terms here.\n\n58\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.670\nWhen we go with Agent Management,\nremember.\n\n59\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.340\nLittle tricky on the jargon here,\n\n60\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.520\nthat's the agent that's\nrunning on the workstation.\n\n61\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.320\nSo any agent that you've installed on\na work station should go up in your\n\n62\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.050\nAgent Management location here.\n\n63\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.960\nSo you will see see here on\nthe left hand side, our domain or\n\n64\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.380\nin this case,\nI've just got a work group created.\n\n65\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.990\nNow if you want to see\nany of the devices or\n\n66\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.290\nthe work stations more specifically here,\nall you have to do is click on the again,\n\n67\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.260\nthe domain or\nthe work group that you might be managing.\n\n68\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.120\nNotice we've got our server.\n\n69\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.990\nOur server here again is\nthe administration server that we have.\n\n70\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.500\nNow, if you want to monitor\nany specific computer,\n\n71\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.660\nall you have to do is double click it.\n\n72\n00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.800\nWhen you double click the server here, or\n\n73\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.940\nexcuse me the work station, one of\nthe things that you're gonna see is it\n\n74\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.750\nshould bring up the properties\nof that device.\n\n75\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.910\nNow, you can also right click on it too\nand you can choose status if you want.\n\n76\n00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.110\nNow if you choose status it will give\nyou some information surrounding\n\n77\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.280\nthe device itself.\n\n78\n00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.250\nBe careful with a couple of the buttons at\nthe top here because these are counters.\n\n79\n00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.350\nYou're gonna see here in a second,\nI'll show you that we've already got\n\n80\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.420\nsome viruses that have been\nfound on this machine.\n\n81\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.170\nAnd we'll show you the real\ntime protection too.\n\n82\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.560\nWe'll show you, Trend Micro put\nits money where its mouth is,\n\n83\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.280\nand we'll see the real time protection.\n\n84\n00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.520\nBut if you click the Reset,\nand well unfortunately,\n\n85\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.780\nit does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n86\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.620\nIt resets the counter, and\n\n87\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.900\nthen you're not gonna be aware of\nany prior problems on this device.\n\n88\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.840\nNow when you're monitoring your device,\nyou can see Scan methods that are allowed.\n\n89\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.460\nYou can see,\nwhere is the File Reputation Services.\n\n90\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.700\nWhere is it going to connect to?\n\n91\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.295\nIn this case you can see,\nit's connecting directly to the web server\n\n92\n00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:48.795\nthat was installed on this machine,\nwhen we installed Trend Micro.\n\n93\n00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:51.305\nAnd we could see some other\ninformation here too.\n\n94\n00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:54.595\nIf I scroll down theres a lot\nof detailed information.\n\n95\n00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.945\nI can see the agent settings and\nlike Dan said,\n\n96\n00:04:57.945 --> 00:05:02.875\nthe agent itself is that communication\nsoftware, that's running\n\n97\n00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:06.655\non the workstation that's communicating\nback in this case to this server.\n\n98\n00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:08.940\nI can also see when it was installed.\n\n99\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.800\nWhen it comes to the virus database,\nwe want to know how up to date it is.\n\n100\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.620\nOr, and if we don't know that,\nwell, we're gonna have problems.\n\n101\n00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.120\nSo you can manage these\ndevices pretty easy.\n\n102\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.880\nJust keep in mind that\nit's just the status.\n\n103\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.270\nLike for instance,\nlet's say I wanted to see the server here.\n\n104\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.320\nThat's my work station,\n\n105\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.180\nall I'd have to do is right click and\nchoose Status right here.\n\n106\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.290\nAnd it'll do exactly that.\n\n107\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.260\nIt'll bring up the status of this device.\n\n108\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.430\nSo pretty easy,\npretty straightforward process.\n\n109\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.060\nWe need to find information\nabout the device.\n\n110\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.330\nNow, how about if we want\nto initiation a scan.\n\n111\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.290\nMaybe we want to tell our workstation or\n\n112\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.990\nthe agent working on the workstation\nthat we want to initiate a scan.\n\n113\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.230\nWell we can do that too and\nlet me get to our machine here.\n\n114\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.200\nNow one of the ways that you can\ntell that the scan is in place\n\n115\n00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.780\nis that the Scan button here you'll\nnotice that it isn't grayed out.\n\n116\n00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.750\nI can click on it myself\nif I want to right now but\n\n117\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.070\nif I do that then we're\nback to the consumer grade.\n\n118\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.360\nWe might as well be doing sneaker net.\n\n119\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.970\nAnd we don't want to do that\nwe want to initiate a scan\n\n120\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.310\nIn a centralized fashion\nfrom the server itself.\n\n121\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.270\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n122\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.950\nNow, this is just as easy\nas seeing the status.\n\n123\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.420\nIf I want to initiate a scan,\nI'm gonna go ahead, and what I'm gonna do,\n\n124\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.370\nI'm gonna select Tasks, and\nthen I'm just gonna select Scan Now.\n\n125\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.770\n>> Now Wes, are you able to\nselect multiple clients and\n\n126\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.930\nstart a scan that way?\n\n127\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.530\n>> Yes, that's a very good question.\n\n128\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.450\nLet's say that I wanted to not\ndo this like I just said like on\n\n129\n00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.070\nan individual base because that can\nincrease the administrative complexity but\n\n130\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.590\nif I've got 60, 100,\n300 computers right here.\n\n131\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.010\nAll I have to do is go up to the top\nof the interface here and I can choose\n\n132\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.960\nScan Now here and now it's gonna fire\noff a scan against all of the devices.\n\n133\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.260\nSo yes, you do have that ability that\nyou don't have to do this one by one.\n\n134\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.040\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's initiate a scan.\n\n135\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.300\nNow when we do this,\nnotice it brings up another window.\n\n136\n00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.420\nIt doesn't just immediately\nhit the scan right away.\n\n137\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.660\nIt's gonna ask you to confirm it.\n\n138\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.280\nSo I'm gonna come in here, and I'm gonna\nselect and I'm gonna choose Scan Now.\n\n139\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.460\nNow, notice what it lets me know.\n\n140\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.250\nIt lets me know that the number of agents\nin which the notification was sent,\n\n141\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.200\nit lets me know who received it,\nhow many received it.\n\n142\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.120\nCuz if you send them, and the agent\ndoesn't respond, you need to be aware of\n\n143\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.800\nthat too because then, obviously,\nyour scan isn't gonna work appropriately.\n\n144\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.749\nSo, we'll go ahead and say OK to this.\n\n145\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.550\nAnd let's go ahead and\njump back over to our machine here.\n\n146\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.968\nIt might take a second to actually\nimplement the scan itself.\n\n147\n00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:57.120\nOne of the easiest ways like\nI said to initiate a scan,\n\n148\n00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.462\nI'm gonna do this just a couple of times\nto make sure it goes through Is that\n\n149\n00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:04.495\nthe scan button you'll see\nwill start to grey out.\n\n150\n00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.420\nNow like I said, takes a little bit.\n\n151\n00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.820\nLet's see if we can get\ninto the logs here.\n\n152\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.890\nThere we go.\n\n153\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.100\nWe'll go to our logs.\n\n154\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.850\nAll right,\nalready got a couple of quarantines.\n\n155\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.860\nLike I said,\nwanna generate some information.\n\n156\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.130\nLooks like it's, there we go.\n\n157\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.730\nAll right, so notice how It's grayed out.\n\n158\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.960\nAnd if you do that hover to discover,\n\n159\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.020\nyou hover over the scan button\neven though it's grayed out.\n\n160\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.800\nIt's telling you, wait until\nthe scan in progress has finished\n\n161\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.610\nbefore starting another one.\n\n162\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.300\nAll right, so we do get that ability.\n\n163\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.020\nNow if we want to monitor.\n\n164\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.380\nThe scan when it completes.\n\n165\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.310\nWell we could come back over here and\nwe can see that information\n\n166\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.750\nagain in the status if we need to, or\nnot the status, excuse me, but the logs.\n\n167\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:56.350\nI can see the scan logs here, has it\ndetected any Malware, any viruses already.\n\n168\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.770\nLet me go ahead and show you that too.\n\n169\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.010\nTo speed up time,\nlike I said, I went ahead and\n\n170\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.450\nwe hit this machine with\na couple of viruses right away so\n\n171\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.120\nwe wouldn't have to wait for the time that\nit took to report back to the server.\n\n172\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.960\nNow we're still going to do that because\nit wouldn't be fun not to do that on\n\n173\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.320\ncamera, right?\n\n174\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.780\nBut I can see here I can get\nsome information, right?\n\n175\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.900\nI can get some information, for instance,\n\n176\n00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.810\nright here in the Security Risk Detections\nsection, all right.\n\n177\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.250\nNotice that it says virus and malware, and\n\n178\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.980\nit tells me right here,\none endpoint, two detections.\n\n179\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.810\nSo I can see going out the gate right now,\nthat we've already found something.\n\n180\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.980\nLet's see what that looks like\nwhen we need to find now,\n\n181\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.920\nwell what is it that it found?\n\n182\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.060\nWe do see that we have some\nviruses that have been detected.\n\n183\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.880\nAnd if I click on the number here,\nthat red number one,\n\n184\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.180\nit tells me exactly which machine\nit is that we have the issue.\n\n185\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.080\nNow at first glance here,\nit's really not telling me much, right?\n\n186\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.930\nIt's not really saying much at all.\n\n187\n00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.510\nOr it's not showing me much.\n\n188\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.250\nBut we have the ability to\nrun a report against it.\n\n189\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.350\nNow that I've identified the machine\nthat has some kind of malware or\n\n190\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.150\nsome kind of virus on it or\nhas had a virus on it, all I have to do\n\n191\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.120\nis with it selected, I can go to logs and\nI can go to virus malware logs.\n\n192\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.580\nNow you can configure\nthis the way you want.\n\n193\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.260\nNotice it says the last seven days.\n\n194\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.130\nI could change that,\nI could say all 24 hours if I want.\n\n195\n00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.810\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nleave it at the default.\n\n196\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.640\nWhat kind of scan types?\n\n197\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.510\nYou know, you'll see manual scan,\nreal time scan.\n\n198\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:36.060\nKeep in mind your real time scan that's\ngonna be your memory locations, processes\n\n199\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.990\nthat are running, scheduled scans, that's\nfairly obvious if we set a daily scan.\n\n200\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.430\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll just keep all the defaults and\n\n201\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.439\nwe'll just run this log real quick.\n\n202\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.390\nNow, here it gives us a little\nbit more information.\n\n203\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:55.190\nIt tells me that there was some\nkind of Trojan blocker there, and\n\n204\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.610\nit also tells me the object, what it was\nthat was scanned that we found a virus in.\n\n205\n00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:06.520\nWe can see the date and time, and you\ncan see two different times right there.\n\n206\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.900\nNow, this is good if you need\nto identify the virus, right?\n\n207\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.820\nWe wanna know what the virus is.\n\n208\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.810\nRemember trending?\n\n209\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.330\nWe might wanna see, since there's\na couple of different times here that\n\n210\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.570\nit's been infected, what's going on?\n\n211\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.110\nRight?\n\n212\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.080\nWhat, maybe,\n\n213\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.650\nactions has the user been performing that\nhas caused this infection to happen?\n\n214\n00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.640\nAnd all this information's really good.\n\n215\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.950\nI can even go as far as seeing\nthe IP address and the Mac address.\n\n216\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.010\nIf I want to view the individual details,\nnotice all the way to the right here,\n\n217\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:40.100\nwe've got this view button and now I\ncan see information directly related.\n\n218\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.130\nYou know,\njust switches up the table here and\n\n219\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.330\nyou can always export this\nto a comma separated value.\n\n220\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.380\nI could do a copy and paste here if I\nwant if you want to save it that way.\n\n221\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.080\nYou don't really have to do that.\n\n222\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.520\nUse the power of the software\nitself to export this information,\n\n223\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.620\nmakes it a little bit easier.\n\n224\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.930\nAll right.\nSo, fairly easy when it comes to\n\n225\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:06.370\nfinding what device had the issue,\nwhat the issue might be.\n\n226\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.550\nNow, if we want to let's\nsay remediate a client.\n\n227\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.800\nLet's go ahead and test it out.\n\n228\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.620\nNow we've showed you, remember I've\nalready populated a couple of these\n\n229\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.535\nviruses so that we would get\nthat information right away.\n\n230\n00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:21.530\nBut let's go ahead and see how\nthe real time protection works here.\n\n231\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.750\nSo we'll go ahead and\ndo, I'll tell you what.\n\n232\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.950\nLet's do an infection,\nright, instead of virus?\n\n233\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.341\n>> Make it sick, [LAUGH].\n\n234\n00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.080\n>> There we go.\n\n235\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.190\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nkeep in mind guys, if you're doing this,\n\n236\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.660\nif you're using something like\nan virus test file, it's not a virus.\n\n237\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.990\nIt's completely safe.\n\n238\n00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.740\nIt's gonna identify it as a virus\njust to test the realtime monitoring.\n\n239\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.750\nOn the other hand,\nif you're doing what we're doing here, and\n\n240\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.230\nyou're actually using live viruses,\nyou wanna be careful.\n\n241\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.070\nKeep in mind your quarantine through\nvirtualization, if you will.\n\n242\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.850\nDon't allow it to have access to your\nnetwork because you wanna ensure,\n\n243\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.400\nif you're testing the software,\ngoing out the gate,\n\n244\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.790\nyou're really not sure if\nit's gonna stop that virus.\n\n245\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.080\nSo make sure that you take\nall the precautions so\n\n246\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.050\nyou don't infect your network.\n\n247\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.010\nNot that I've ever done that before.\n\n248\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.950\n>> Oh, no.\n>> [LAUGH] So let's see here.\n\n249\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.460\nWe'll see if we can let this one go.\n\n250\n00:13:15.732 --> 00:13:17.440\nAll right, oh and you know what,\n\n251\n00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.750\nit's not gonna allow me access to\nthe temporary location with the profile.\n\n252\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.110\nYou know my user profile where\nthere's information gonna be stored.\n\n253\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.650\nAnd let's see does it do anything else?\n\n254\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.520\nDoesn't look like it, oh there it is.\n\n255\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.850\nCan't complete the extraction there,\ndestination file couldn't be created.\n\n256\n00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.090\nSo, you can see right away it tells us and\nthere it goes.\n\n257\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.950\nThere we go.\n\n258\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.870\nSo, the real time protection\non this is fairly quick.\n\n259\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.500\nIt didn't allow us to\nextract that file at all, so\n\n260\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.190\nit didn't allow it to\nwrite to the registry.\n\n261\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.240\nI just happen to know\nwhat this virus is doing.\n\n262\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.980\nIt's trying to replicate itself into\nthe AppData location where your\n\n263\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.320\ntemporary files are.\n\n264\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.640\nAnd then it also tries to make a direct\nmodification to the Hkey local machine,\n\n265\n00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.325\nwhich is your settings that your operating\nsystem uses to configure the hardware.\n\n266\n00:14:07.325 --> 00:14:10.490\nSo, this one really tries to slip\nitself down into the deepest portion of\n\n267\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.630\nthe operating system and\nthank goodness for\n\n268\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:17.030\nus it looks like it did it's job and\nit's resolved the issue.\n\n269\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.506\nNow\n>> I was going to say Wes this is\n\n270\n00:14:18.506 --> 00:14:19.870\nactually a really good feature.\n\n271\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.430\nThe fact that Wes actually was\nintentionally trying to infect his\n\n272\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.550\nmachine, and he basically got nowhere.\n\n273\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.660\nRight?\n\n274\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.920\nKilled it right out of the gate.\n\n275\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.810\nSaid, not on my watch, right?\n\n276\n00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.370\nThis is a fantastic thing,\nbecause what happens?\n\n277\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.950\nHow do computers get infected?\n\n278\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.490\nHow does that end work\nstation get infected?\n\n279\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.850\nWell, you've got an end user,\nand end user gets an email.\n\n280\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.280\nAn email has an attachment on it.\n\n281\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.318\nHey check out this spreadsheet, check\nout this MP3 file, check out this game.\n\n282\n00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:46.060\nAnd they double-click it and\nthey try to run it.\n\n283\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.020\nWell, that's basically what\nthose packages usually are,\n\n284\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.040\nif they're an infection,\nit's gonna be some sort of Trojan or\n\n285\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.940\nmalware that's gonna infect\nthe system at that point in time.\n\n286\n00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.610\nThis didn't even let\nthat get out of the gate.\n\n287\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.426\nAnd as long as your anti-virus,\nanti-malware definitions are up-to-date,\n\n288\n00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:02.261\nthat's exactly what they should see.\n\n289\n00:15:02.261 --> 00:15:03.690\nThere gonna get that.\n\n290\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.720\nYou as an admin, your management consul's\nprobably gonna alert you to the fact that\n\n291\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.240\nyou had an infection and\nif it cleaned it up you're good to go.\n\n292\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.520\nAnd if it said it couldn't clean it up for\n\n293\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.340\nwhatever reason,\nthen you got to take further steps.\n\n294\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.650\nBut this is exactly what you want to\nsee when an infection tries to strike.\n\n295\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.160\n>> Definitely.\n\n296\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.920\nAnd you know, I tell you, a lot of\nthe zero day viruses when they are found,\n\n297\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.910\nand all of the software we've been\nlooking at is really good software,\n\n298\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.690\na lot of those zero day viruses,\nwhen they're found,\n\n299\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.880\nthey tend to have a trend micro stamp\non them, when they found them, so.\n\n300\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.910\nReally good stuff here.\n\n301\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.730\nSo, in the remediation of the client,\n\n302\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.490\nyou also have some logs on the client\nside that you can look at too.\n\n303\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.800\nAnd will go ahead and\nshow you those real quick.\n\n304\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.630\nAnd in fact,\nlet me kind of zoom in here a little bit.\n\n305\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.000\nNow keep in mind, I'm just showing\nyou this from the client side.\n\n306\n00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.459\nYou as an administrator, probably aren't\ngonna be on the client side, right?\n\n307\n00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:56.853\nYou're gonna be hopefully in a centralized\nlocation, away from all of the hundreds or\n\n308\n00:15:56.853 --> 00:15:58.430\nthousands of computers here.\n\n309\n00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.766\nBut it is good to know where\nthis information Is here.\n\n310\n00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:04.748\nNow you can see that\nwe've actually got a few.\n\n311\n00:16:04.748 --> 00:16:07.833\nThe two that I told you that I've already\nlaunched prior to us ever starting this,\n\n312\n00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.850\nand then the one that\nwe've just seen here.\n\n313\n00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.480\nAnd if we need to, we can see information\nmuch like we've seen on the server side.\n\n314\n00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.370\nOne of the interesting things too is,\nnotice it says open the folder.\n\n315\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.750\nIf I want to find out,\nis that information there in the folder?\n\n316\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.430\nDid it really quarantine it,\ndid it really take care of it?\n\n317\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.050\nWell, you can use this information, and\n\n318\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.770\nyou can go into that location if\nyou have administrative rights.\n\n319\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.040\n>> That does help.\n>> I was going to say,\n\n320\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.320\nwe might need to make sure we.\n\n321\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.210\nSay that.\n\n322\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:39.770\nThen local, temp, and crazy number,\ncrazy number, I don't see it.\n\n323\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.310\nStarts with a bunch of numbers there,\nand I don't see it in here.\n\n324\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.580\nSo, it did it's job, which is really good.\n\n325\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.530\nNow, that's on the client side,\nbut there again,\n\n326\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.760\nkeep in mind,\nwe're not going to be on the client side.\n\n327\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.870\nI do want to take a second here real\nquick, and show you the scan operation\n\n328\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.870\nlog, okay, it doesn't have\na scan going on right yet, and\n\n329\n00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.812\nthat's one of the things that we probably\nwant to go ahead and initiate too.\n\n330\n00:16:58.812 --> 00:17:02.910\nAll right,\nnow let's look back at the dashboard here,\n\n331\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.910\nlet's see if it's updated yet.\n\n332\n00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.080\nAnd it takes a second for\nthe web page to refresh here, and\n\n333\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.400\nwe'll see if we've got three yet.\n\n334\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.350\nSometimes it's quick, sometimes it's not.\n\n335\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.120\nNo it hasn't updated that yet,\nso keep that in mind,\n\n336\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.920\nthat it might take a little bit.\n\n337\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.040\nIt's near real time protection.\n\n338\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.290\nBut I would venture to\nsay that here in a bit,\n\n339\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.640\nif we keep refreshing this, you'd probably\nsee that number go from two to three.\n\n340\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.810\nAnd probably take a little\nbit longer than that.\n\n341\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.550\nOh, no so, you can see\nthe information on the server side.\n\n342\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:40.180\nAll of your workstations will\nreport back into the server.\n\n343\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.190\nKeep in mind that this\ninformation is important.\n\n344\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.350\nYou need to have it.\n\n345\n00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.770\nYou need to look at things like trends,\nbecause you can group your users together\n\n346\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.050\nbased on their functionality, or\nyour workstations more importantly.\n\n347\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.710\nBased on whatever the role\nis in the company.\n\n348\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.870\nAnd if you look at one of these infections\nand you see that hey, it's coming from\n\n349\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.140\na certain subnet, and it's hitting more\nthan one computer on a certain subnet.\n\n350\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.070\nI might say,\n\n351\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.370\nI think what that is, is that's gonna\nbe something like maybe a Trojan.\n\n352\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.980\nOr not a trojan but a worm.\n\n353\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.880\nWhere they bounce themselves between\nmachine, to machine, to machine.\n\n354\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.180\nAnd try to consume resources.\n\n355\n00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.550\nSo let's see if we can force,\noh it hasn't updated too.\n\n356\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.310\nAnd let me just also show you how\nyou can get that information out.\n\n357\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.396\nSo pretty easy when you're looking\nat the logs of the agents, right.\n\n358\n00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.620\nYou're checking those security risks.\n\n359\n00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.190\nAgain the security risk it\nshould update here in a bit.\n\n360\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.830\nIt hasn't updated, so\nI'm a little impatient there.\n\n361\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.470\nFaster computers get,\nthe more impatient I get there.\n\n362\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.050\nBut Dan, it looks like Trend Micro here.\n\n363\n00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.660\nIt's done its job, it's remediated\nthe client, and all we're doing, really,\n\n364\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.530\nis just waiting for\nthat information to update.\n\n365\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.330\nStill hasn't quite done it yet, but here\nin a bit, the agent itself, it'll reach\n\n366\n00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:50.050\nback out to the server and it'll push\nits log back up to the server there.\n\n367\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.290\nWe'll see an update, and\nthen we can go from there on any kind of\n\n368\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.330\nafter action, be proactive next time.\n\n369\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.120\nCalling the end user, saying, okay.\n\n370\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.970\nWe've seen a couple of viruses.\n\n371\n00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.100\nIn this case it might be the third virus.\n\n372\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.160\nWhat's going on?\n\n373\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.000\nWhere are you going?\n\n374\n00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.290\nWhat are you doing to download these\nviruses or get them on your machines?\n\n375\n00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:14.300\nAnd maybe the customer themselves, or the\nuser isn't even aware that it's happening.\n\n376\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.435\nYou can implement some kind of\nproactive implementation, say,\n\n377\n00:19:17.435 --> 00:19:22.200\nhey you don't want to be opening those\nattachments that you know are zip files,\n\n378\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.490\nor coming from unknown sources,\nstay away from that, right?\n\n379\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.870\nYou don't want to go to certain websites\nwhere the web browser said, you know,\n\n380\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.730\nyou better, it's not recommended\nto visit this website.\n\n381\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.970\nSo whatever you would implement after\nthat is trying to be proactive and\n\n382\n00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.705\nnot just reactive.\n\n383\n00:19:35.705 --> 00:19:40.670\nCuz here, this is more reactive than it\nis proactive, but at least if you gather\n\n384\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.120\nthis information over a course of time,\nyou can maybe develop some strategies.\n\n385\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.090\nBecause remember, when it comes to\nany kind of security infrastructure,\n\n386\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.390\nit starts with policies,\nprocedures and awareness and so\n\n387\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.340\nDan, looks like Trend Micro's\ndone its job here for us.\n\n388\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.650\n>> Yeah, seems to be a great product.\n\n389\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.440\nVery easy to use, and you gotta remember\nactually the monitoring portion\n\n390\n00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.580\nas an admin that's what you're\ngonna be looking at a lot, so\n\n391\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.250\nI mean a lot, a lot that and\n\n392\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:12.100\nthen cleaning up anything that might\nhave missed or something got around it.\n\n393\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.490\nNow I saw the monitoring is important.\n\n394\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.680\nI used to have Outlook rules that would\nsend all my alerts to a certain folder,\n\n395\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.480\nand then I could go through it,\nprobably three to four times a day.\n\n396\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.170\nAnd do what Wes was just talking about.\n\n397\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.080\nLooking for a trend.\n\n398\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.580\nLooking for okay,\nI've got this computer anti-virus and\n\n399\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.320\nit was deleted and remediated.\n\n400\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.910\nEverything's fine with it now.\n\n401\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.670\nIf I start seeing that same computer and\nit's getting hit again.\n\n402\n00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.690\nIt's getting hit again.\n\n403\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.790\nIt's getting hit again.\n\n404\n00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.720\nI start seeing that trend.\n\n405\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.840\nWell, that's really the power that\ncomes from the monitoring portion of\n\n406\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.160\nthe management software.\n\n407\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.240\nNot to mention the fact that you can\njust shove out clients from one spot,\n\n408\n00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.600\nobviously that's awesome to do,\nbut watching those alerts,\n\n409\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.690\nwatching to see where\nthe trends are happening.\n\n410\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.880\nSee who's my worst offenders,\n\n411\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.520\nwhy do you keep going to sites\nyou're not supposed to go to?\n\n412\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.640\nWhy do you keep downloading and\ninstalling attachments from email?\n\n413\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.790\nAnd they'll give you every\nreason under the sun, but\n\n414\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.320\nwhen you can show them that hard data and\ngo, look, you're\n\n415\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.480\nthe person I have to call all the time\nbecause you're not following the rules.\n\n416\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.430\nAnd I can only go so\nfar as to try to keep you safe.\n\n417\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.090\nI'm doing the best job I can, and\nyou continually push that boundary,\n\n418\n00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.670\nso using this data is going to\nhelp you find those people and\n\n419\n00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.780\ntry to talk some sense into them.\n\n420\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.860\nLet them know, hey this is probably\nsomething you need to start really paying\n\n421\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.000\nattention to, and\nbecause it's a benefit to you, right.\n\n422\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.020\nThat's what we want to look for, that\nthe fact that, how much is it worth for\n\n423\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.390\nyour data to get compromised?\n\n424\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.650\nHow much is it worth for,\nif you're in a business setting?\n\n425\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.360\nThat your customers identity\nmaybe gets stolen because\n\n426\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.490\nyou're downloading games off of\npeople sending you attachments.\n\n427\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.870\nThis is where the power of\nthis monitoring sub comes in.\n\n428\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.930\nYou'll be able to see what's happening and\nfind out where the trends are.\n\n429\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.870\nUse that to your advantage,\nthat is the number one key of this stuff.\n\n430\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:54.720\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n431\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.880\nAnd you know just make sure\nyou setup notifications too.\n\n432\n00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.780\nYou're the one that's the administrator.\n\n433\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.810\nYou want to be aware of it.\n\n434\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.880\nAnd if you don't set up things like\nyour SMTP server, where it can\n\n435\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.120\nforward this information cuz we're only\ndealing right now with just one computer.\n\n436\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.420\nYou can get an overwhelming\namount of information.\n\n437\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.390\nNow, that doesn't just necessarily mean\nthat you're gonna have a whole bunch\n\n438\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.930\nof viruses.\n\n439\n00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.580\nBut remember the software like this and\n\n440\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.340\none of the things again that\nmakes this enterprise solutions,\n\n441\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.360\nis you have other things like policies and\ncompliance, current health statuses.\n\n442\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.590\nIt's not just, hey,\nwhat is the virus that we're looking for?\n\n443\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.750\nDo we have an infection?\n\n444\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.710\nNo, we want to see the health\nstate of our computers.\n\n445\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.530\nAnd if we've got 5,000 of them, you've got\na lot of information in a table that you\n\n446\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:42.480\nneed to look through, so use the power\nof the administration server.\n\n447\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.270\nExport that information if you\nhave a more user-friendly format.\n\n448\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.040\nIt makes it a lot easier to go through.\n\n449\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.310\nKeep that documentation.\n\n450\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.560\nYou don't want to just erase it, because\nthe last couple of months have been fine.\n\n451\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.430\nYou're going to want to\nkeep that information.\n\n452\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.080\nIf it happens to be a fly-by-night virus,\nthen you've remediated,\n\n453\n00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080\nit's okay if it happens to be a trend.\n\n454\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.940\nThen again, you might have to put\nin other checks and balances.\n\n455\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.040\nYou might have to go out to your routers,\nout to your network devices,\n\n456\n00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.990\nand implement other types\nof security techniques.\n\n457\n00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.120\nBut for the most part,\nthis is a very, very good start.\n\n458\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.020\nIt gives you a lot of reachability on your\nclients, the monitoring capabilities,\n\n459\n00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.410\nthe auditing capabilities,\nwhich is all things that we need, Dan,\n\n460\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.320\nthey're in our enterprise\nlevel environment.\n\n461\n00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.050\n>> Yeah, it does sound glamorous\n\n462\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.920\nto hear about I'm the security guy\ncuz I do the antivirus system.\n\n463\n00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.940\nAnd you all part of security if\nyou're running antivirus, but\n\n464\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.170\nman is it a lot of Well, okay.\n\n465\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.140\nI've got 15 machines with\ndefinitions that are out of date.\n\n466\n00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.680\nI've got to get those up to snuff, right?\n\n467\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.820\nThat can't last.\n\n468\n00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.430\nI've got five outbreaks going\non in four different places.\n\n469\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.530\nI gotta check that out.\n\n470\n00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.345\nThat's a lot of what\nyou're gonna be doing.\n\n471\n00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.355\nTrend Micro systems.\n\n472\n00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:52.135\nI'm actually really impressed with it.\n\n473\n00:23:52.135 --> 00:23:53.165\nI really like their interface.\n\n474\n00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:54.875\nI like the ease of use of it.\n\n475\n00:23:54.875 --> 00:23:55.675\nGreat job, Wes.\n\n476\n00:23:55.675 --> 00:23:57.885\nIs there any parting words\nof wisdom that we need?\n\n477\n00:23:57.885 --> 00:24:00.125\n>> No.\nJust like we've said in past episodes,\n\n478\n00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:03.470\ndoesn't matter if it's consumer grade,\ndoesn't matter if it's Enterprise grade,\n\n479\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.620\nIf you are implementing antivirus,\nkeep it up to date.\n\n480\n00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.070\nIf you're using a centralized repository\nof things like your dat files, or\n\n481\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.420\nyour signature definitions,\nkeep those databases up to date, so\n\n482\n00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.390\nthat when your clients connect back and\nthey update,\n\n483\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.440\nthey have the most current database,\nthe current security scan engine.\n\n484\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.900\nSo that they can be able to find\nthose viruses, cuz remember if\n\n485\n00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.260\nyou don't have the definitions to\ndefine what a virus looks like well,\n\n486\n00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.595\nyou're not going to be able to find them,\n\n487\n00:24:30.595 --> 00:24:33.980\nthey'll slip under the radar and\nit's going to cause you a lot of headache.\n\n488\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.030\n>> Brian, you're a smart man.\n\n489\n00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.420\nEverybody out there listen to everything\nhe just said, cuz he is 100% correct.\n\n490\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.790\nAnd that's what you're going to do\nif you're the AV guy in your system.\n\n491\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.820\nThat being said Wes, thank you for\njoining us, thank you for\n\n492\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.160\nshowing us how to use Trend Micro systems.\n\n493\n00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.930\nAnd for us, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPro TV,\n\n494\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.850\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry,\nand I'm Wes Brian.\n\n495\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.810\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n496\n00:24:55.810

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:20.598\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:24.708\nour antivirus, antimalware, and actually\nwe're gonna take a look at some of\n\n5\n00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:29.300\nour Enterprise solutions, the benefits and\ndifferences from our standard fare.\n\n6\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.970\nAnd joining us today is our resident\nexpert on said topic, you know him,\n\n7\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.580\nYou love him, his name is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.600\nWes, welcome to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.610\nHow are you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.330\n>> I'm doing good.\n\n11\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.100\nIt's great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.330\nThanks, Dan, as always.\n\n13\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.850\nAnd that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.730\nWe're gonna be moving on.\n\n15\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.170\nWe've been talking about consumer-grade\nantivirus, anti-malware technologies, and\n\n16\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.520\nnow we've got to look at some of\nthe bigger technologies, right?\n\n17\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.670\nWell, I don't know if the technology,\nitself, is bigger,\n\n18\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.690\nbut at least the scope of\nthe technology and how it can manage.\n\n19\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.550\nKeep in mind some of the things that\nwe've been mentioning are consumer grades\n\n20\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.180\nbeing able to manage just\nmaybe a handful of devices.\n\n21\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.670\nAnd a lot of times they won't\neven manage a handful of devices,\n\n22\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.490\nthey have to be to be managed\non an individual basis right.\n\n23\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.930\nAnd really not scaling up to\nanything bigger than a workroom.\n\n24\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.470\nYou've got one device,\nyou need to perform a scan.\n\n25\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.090\nWell, you've got to walk\nover to that device.\n\n26\n00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.790\nIf it's a mobile device you\nmight have it in your pocket,\n\n27\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.960\nbut you have to manually implement a scan.\n\n28\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.950\nAnd that's a really\ndecentralized environment,\n\n29\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.930\nit's a really decentralized way to\nadminister the antivirus software, and\n\n30\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.520\nit's okay for small locations or\nsmall home offices.\n\n31\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.220\nThey can benefit from it, too, and\nyou don't have to pay a lot of money.\n\n32\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.098\nBut when time is money and\n\n33\n00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:38.885\nyou have a large Enterprise environment,\nyou really just don't have\n\n34\n00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:43.755\nthe time to go station to station to\nstation trying to manage these devices.\n\n35\n00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:47.125\nAnd as you add hundreds upon hundreds, and\n\n36\n00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:52.032\nscale up to 5,000 or\nbeyond plus computers, now\n\n37\n00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:55.622\nyou really don't have the time to manage\nthose devices on an individual basis.\n\n38\n00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:58.812\nSo what we're gonna be looking at is what\n\n39\n00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:03.050\nmakes up the characteristics of\nan Enterprise antivirus solution?\n\n40\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.840\nNow, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at a couple of things here.\n\n41\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.010\nIn a small environment,\n\n42\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.170\nremember that we're gonna have to manage\ncomputers on an individual basis.\n\n43\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.930\nSo six computers here, it's not gonna\nreally be that big of a deal to do\n\n44\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.420\nthe whole sneakernet and\ngo from computer to computer to computer.\n\n45\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.790\nBut when you start adding devices, right,\nnow we've got a whole bunch of devices.\n\n46\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.560\nWell, if you're on the security team and\nyou have to manage these devices\n\n47\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.470\non an individual basis, well, that's all\nyou're gonna be doing is running antivirus\n\n48\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.830\nscans all day long because that's\nall you'll have time to do.\n\n49\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.380\nAnd I know it sounds kind of\nridiculous out there, and it really is.\n\n50\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.620\nI mean, it's just not\nsomething that you want to do.\n\n51\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.310\nNow, what if it comes down to, let's say,\nmaybe having multiple floors, right.\n\n52\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.760\nI've got a couple of floors out here\nthat I've got to manage, three or\n\n53\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.370\nfour floors, and\nit could be buildings right.\n\n54\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.170\nThese could just be as simple\nas having multiple locations,\n\n55\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.710\nright, building one, building two,\nbuilding three, building four.\n\n56\n00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.090\nMaybe I have, for instance,\nmaybe I have some database servers, right?\n\n57\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.990\nWell, those database servers, they usually\ncontain a lot of your information,\n\n58\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.000\nyour business critical information,\n\n59\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.270\nthat you could lose hundreds of thousands\nof dollars, maybe even millions of dollars\n\n60\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.630\nan hour for every hour that you don't\nhave access to that information, right?\n\n61\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.090\nWe've got web servers\nthat we have to protect.\n\n62\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.480\nWe have to make sure that if,\n\n63\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.960\nlet's say that we have online forums that\nyour customers have to fill out, right?\n\n64\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.190\nThey've got to get to those web servers\nand, well, we need to manage those,\n\n65\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.160\ntoo, right?\n\n66\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.790\nWell, maybe we have other things,\nright, like kiosks.\n\n67\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.330\nWell, we might have to manage those,\ntoo, and\n\n68\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.670\nyou don't wanna do that\non an individual basis.\n\n69\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.580\nAnd, Dan, I'll say, the other thing\n\n70\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.500\nis that even though these are a computer\nis a computer is a computer,\n\n71\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.180\none of the things that sets it apart is\nthe role that it plays in your network.\n\n72\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.180\nThey're gonna be managed different, right?\n\n73\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.020\nYou might not have the same type of\nsettings on your database servers that you\n\n74\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.040\nwould on your web servers versus what\nyou would have on a workstation, right?\n\n75\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.330\nThere might be a situation where maybe\nyou have an entire set of servers that\n\n76\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.020\nare completely managed and so protected\nthat they can't even communicate with\n\n77\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.280\noutbound computers,\nmaybe just a handful of them.\n\n78\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.700\nSo when you start to look at the mix and\n\n79\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.020\nmatch of different devices that you\nhave on your networks here, and\n\n80\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.770\non a large scale, really large scale,\nthose consumer grade antivirus solutions,\n\n81\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.500\nDan, they're not really gonna\ndo us the justice that we need.\n\n82\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.290\n>> No I'm looking at your diagram here,\nand already thinking to myself if I had to\n\n83\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.880\nrun the consumer grade on this topology,\nwhat we're looking at right here,\n\n84\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.290\nI would probably be looking for\na different job at that point.\n\n85\n00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.310\nI would say, you know what,\nthis is this is not going to happen.\n\n86\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.480\nWe need something better because you\ngotta think of it in these terms.\n\n87\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.040\nI've gotta do virus definition updates,\n\n88\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.530\nI've gotta make sure that they're\nconfigured to do it correctly.\n\n89\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.060\nIf anything goes wrong and they don't\nupdate, then what do I do, right?\n\n90\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.290\nNow, I've gotta go to that machine,\nand make sure it's happening.\n\n91\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.570\nMaybe I've got ten machines\nthat aren't updating correctly.\n\n92\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.120\nNow I'm gonna go to ten different machines\nand make sure everything's working.\n\n93\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.900\nWhat if I get a virus?\n\n94\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.580\nWhat if I get 20 viruses?\n\n95\n00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.660\nWhat do I do?\n\n96\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.870\nThat consumer grade stuff is great for\none, three, maybe five computers.\n\n97\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.320\nWhen you start looking at topology of\nthis size, that is just not practical.\n\n98\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.110\n>> Yeah, sure, and then on top of it,\nright, you have multiple buildings.\n\n99\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.300\nHow about if it's dispersed worldwide?\n\n100\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.580\nMaybe you work for a major insurance\ncompany, maybe you work for\n\n101\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.430\na major distribution company.\n\n102\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.290\nNow we're not just talking about\na couple of buildings, right?\n\n103\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.490\nWe're not just talking about a couple\nlands spread out, we're here in\n\n104\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.840\nthe States, throughout the United States,\nwhich in and of itself is very complex.\n\n105\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.915\nBut what if we have offices\nlocated out in the UK, or\n\n106\n00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:37.950\nwe have maybe some offices\nwere international business.\n\n107\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.600\nWe have some in Japan, right,\nmaybe down in Australia.\n\n108\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.980\nIt's not feasible to use and\nyou certainly couldn't.\n\n109\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.020\nI mean, not only the feasibility part, but\n\n110\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.388\nyou just could not manage it with\na consumer-based product here.\n\n111\n00:05:51.388 --> 00:05:54.830\nThe other thing that you might\nbe thinking, too, is, or I guess\n\n112\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.500\nI should just mention, is the centralized\nmanagement aspect of this, right.\n\n113\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.780\nWe talk about decentralized model\ninside of your home environments, but\n\n114\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.990\nwe want to centralized location.\n\n115\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.400\nJust like Dan's saying, we've got all\nthese different things that we have to do.\n\n116\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.930\nWe gotta keep the agents, the software\nthat's on the machines up to date,\n\n117\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.935\nwe have to keep the virus\ndatabases up to date.\n\n118\n00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:22.970\nDo we have a health compliance\nthat we have to follow?\n\n119\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.420\nDo we have a security policy that\nneeds to be implemented and followed?\n\n120\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.090\nWell, It's very easy on a large-scale for\ncomputers to fall\n\n121\n00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.630\nagainst your security policies or\nto run contrary to your security policy.\n\n122\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.680\nSo it is very, very important there,\n\n123\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.290\nDan, to make sure that we do have\nthat centralized administration.\n\n124\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.330\n>> Yeah, I was just thinking to myself as\nyou were talking, Wes, how do I even know\n\n125\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.620\nthat these computers have a problem,\nor they're running correctly?\n\n126\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.670\nHow do I know that?\n\n127\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.650\nWhat is the indication?\n\n128\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.050\nI would have to go to each and\nevery computer and\n\n129\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.210\nsit down at it and look at its status and\nmake sure everything is working correctly.\n\n130\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.510\nI would have to do that every single day,\nand if I'm being good about it,\n\n131\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.320\nI'm doing it twice a day, right?\n\n132\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.020\nThat is, again, it's just not feasible,\nit does not make sense.\n\n133\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.030\nIt would be unreasonable to ask someone\nto say, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n134\n00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.700\nAnd that's where the Enterprise-level\nsolution comes in.\n\n135\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.470\nIt is our white knight,\nit comes in, swoops down, and\n\n136\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.760\nsays, let's centralize that,\nlet's make everything in one spot,\n\n137\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.670\nso that one person even, or\nprobably a small team of people,\n\n138\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.890\ncan manage a complex network\nof this size and portion.\n\n139\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.980\nSo, Wes, that actually kinda brings us\nto where do we begin as we're looking.\n\n140\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.393\nObviously we're comparing and\n\n141\n00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:40.116\ncontrasting the consumer side\nversus the Enterprise level.\n\n142\n00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:43.413\nWhere do we really begin with what\nthe enterprise level can do for us?\n\n143\n00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:48.260\n>> One of the first things is scaling,\nright, the scalability,\n\n144\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.470\nthe ability to scale up quickly, right?\n\n145\n00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.626\nIf you think about it, okay,\n\n146\n00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:55.463\nI've just added five extra computers\nto my network and my home network.\n\n147\n00:07:55.463 --> 00:07:58.180\nMaybe I started out with two,\nright, now I'm up to seven.\n\n148\n00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.510\nWell, to scale out there,\nI have to purchase the product, right?\n\n149\n00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.879\nOr even if it's free.\n\n150\n00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:04.680\nI don't have to purchase it.\n\n151\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.952\nBut I still have to go and do a manual\nsneaker.net type installation on each one\n\n152\n00:08:08.952 --> 00:08:12.220\nof those devices that have now\nbeen added to our networks.\n\n153\n00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.310\nSo one of the great things,\nnot only is the centralized management,\n\n154\n00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.990\nis the ability to scale two\nvery large environments.\n\n155\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.610\nIt doesn't have to be large environments,\ncould be a small business.\n\n156\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.367\nYou could have somewhere\nbetween I don't know one.\n\n157\n00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:26.930\nAnd, you're a very small business I\nguess if you only have one computer.\n\n158\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.786\nBut, like 250 computers.\n\n159\n00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:33.507\nBut then as you start to go beyond that,\nbeyond that 250 computers,\n\n160\n00:08:33.507 --> 00:08:37.377\n1,000 computers,\n5000 computers and beyond.\n\n161\n00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:40.340\nYou need some kind of solution that says.\n\n162\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.211\nYou know what, I just added a deployment\nof 500 computers to this network.\n\n163\n00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:48.000\nAnd now I need the software pushed\nout to those 500 computers.\n\n164\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.690\nNow there's another concept.\n\n165\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.390\nPushing the software out, right?\n\n166\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.340\nPart of the centralized\nadministration is being able to.\n\n167\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.687\nFirst of all, discover those\nnew computers on your networks.\n\n168\n00:08:57.687 --> 00:09:02.597\nAnd then from that centralized location,\nsend the software over the network.\n\n169\n00:09:02.597 --> 00:09:04.267\nNow, that's only the one way we can do it.\n\n170\n00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:09.091\nBut that's definitely a common method, is\nto where you can initiate an installation\n\n171\n00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:12.310\nof whatever the endpoint\nprotection software might be.\n\n172\n00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.850\nWhether they call it\na client installation.\n\n173\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.100\nThey call it an agent installation.\n\n174\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.330\nAs you'll come to see they do call\nit a few different things here.\n\n175\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.960\nBut what it really boils down to is.\n\n176\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.650\nHow do I get that software\nout to those 500 computers\n\n177\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.310\nthat have just been\ndeployed to my network?\n\n178\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.680\nThe other thing that we have, too,\n\n179\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.980\nis being able to track the information,\nright?\n\n180\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.180\nI wanna be able to know, Is the agent\neven installed on the endpoint?\n\n181\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.060\nDo I have those 500 computers?\n\n182\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.130\nHave I pushed out that agent,\nand is it installed?\n\n183\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.516\nWe don't wanna just set the installation\nof that agent and then walk away from it.\n\n184\n00:09:45.516 --> 00:09:46.132\nAnd then we'll say.\n\n185\n00:09:46.132 --> 00:09:47.620\nWell, you know what?\n\n186\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.120\nI think it was deployed.\n\n187\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.590\nNo we would need confirmation.\n\n188\n00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.430\nSo you get the auditing, right.\n\n189\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.190\nYou get the logging of that information.\n\n190\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.150\nAnd then you get to\ncollect all the reports\n\n191\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.790\nof that information in\na centralized fashion too.\n\n192\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.220\nNow one of the things that a lot of\ntimes this is gonna use as well and\n\n193\n00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.550\nanother thing that definitely\nseparates it from consumer grade.\n\n194\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.910\nIf you think about consumer grade, right?\n\n195\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.370\nEach individual computer maintains logs,\nright?\n\n196\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.517\nEach individual computer\nhas it's own reports.\n\n197\n00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:22.091\nWith the scaling up a lot of information\nwe go beyond 5,000 computers.\n\n198\n00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:25.461\nAnd it doesn't have to be that much,\nreally it can be I guess just a couple\n\n199\n00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:28.450\nhundred computers is there's\na lot of information.\n\n200\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.660\nAnd we don't want to have to go to\nevery computer pulling it's logs.\n\n201\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.440\nFinding out hey is client 01,\nhas it been infected?\n\n202\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.460\nSo we also use other technologies\ntoo that start to integrate.\n\n203\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.360\nNow, you can integrate with the existing\ntechnologies that you have on\n\n204\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.060\nyour network.\n\n205\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.150\nOr a lot of times this enterprise levels\nsoftware will allow you to create things\n\n206\n00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150\nlike databases internally\nin the software itself.\n\n207\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.080\nWhere you can say yup, we're gonna\nscale up let say a thousand clients.\n\n208\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.860\nWe're gonna need a place to store\nall that information, right.\n\n209\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.800\nSo, how do we store the information?\n\n210\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.310\nTypically we store the information\nin the form of a database.\n\n211\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.295\nA structured database.\n\n212\n00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:05.655\nSo that if we need to pull those reports.\n\n213\n00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:08.410\nWe need to find out what's\ngoing on our networks.\n\n214\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.454\nWe have some kind of technology that\nhelps us store that information in\n\n215\n00:11:12.454 --> 00:11:13.990\na logical way.\n\n216\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.530\nLike I said,\n\n217\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.940\nyou could integrate it into existing\ntechnologies that you already have.\n\n218\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.820\nSo, a lot of information\nis gonna be collected.\n\n219\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.090\nYou're gonna need to be able to collect\nit again in a centralized location.\n\n220\n00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.190\nSo it's good to be able\nto have that auditing.\n\n221\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.170\nThe reporting and\nthe logging of that information.\n\n222\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.030\nSo, you can use it to find out are there\ntrends, is there a certain subnet?\n\n223\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.900\nRight?\nMaybe its a subnet that's getting\n\n224\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.400\ninfected.\n\n225\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.880\nYou identify it as a specific piece\nof software that likes to travel\n\n226\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.010\nacross the network.\n\n227\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.000\nWell, I need to know that information.\n\n228\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.620\nRight?\n\n229\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.440\nBut, a home environment I don't want\nto wait until I can't log in to\n\n230\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.840\nall my computers to find that out.\n\n231\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.180\nThat's bad enough.\n\n232\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.600\nBut you don't want to bring him down\nan entire network inside of an enterprise\n\n233\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600\nlevel you know business.\n\n234\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.480\nThat's definitely going\nto hinder productivity.\n\n235\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.140\nSo good stuff to have things like\nthe auditing and the logging and\n\n236\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.020\nbeing able to review that\ninformation there Dan.\n\n237\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.475\n>> Yes, it's wise words.\n\n238\n00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:04.507\nI've worked in this type\nof environment before.\n\n239\n00:12:04.507 --> 00:12:08.022\nAnd that's exactly one of the main\nreasons that you're going to deploy\n\n240\n00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:10.120\nan enterprise-level solution.\n\n241\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.350\nAnother really interesting thing is,\nif you think of computers, right.\n\n242\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.060\nA little box that sits on someone's desk,\nor under their desk, or\n\n243\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.060\nmaybe they've got a laptop.\n\n244\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.860\nComputers come in all shapes and\nsizes these days.\n\n245\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.040\nBut also, these days,\nwe have what's called virtualization.\n\n246\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.240\nNow this is a place where\nthe enterprise level solution\n\n247\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.270\ncan set itself ahead of the pack,\nor apart from our consumer grade.\n\n248\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.170\nAm I right there, Wes?\n\n249\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.355\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n250\n00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:37.063\nAnd you know guys, you've seen use some\nmachines here that are virtualized.\n\n251\n00:12:37.063 --> 00:12:37.747\nSo you might say.\n\n252\n00:12:37.747 --> 00:12:38.900\nWell, wait a second then.\n\n253\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.800\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n254\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.330\nYou guys are, you're using\nsoftware in your virtual machines.\n\n255\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.460\nBut that's only one or\ntwo virtual machines.\n\n256\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.940\nIf you have an entire corporate\nvirtual desktop infrastructure,\n\n257\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.490\nwhere you've got 1,000 computers\ndistributed behind a server cluster.\n\n258\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.260\nCan your consumer grade software?\n\n259\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.686\nCan it manage and maintain those?\n\n260\n00:12:58.686 --> 00:13:00.871\nAnd the chances are,\nyou guys probably already know the answer.\n\n261\n00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:04.010\nBut it doesn't work for\nthat kind of situation.\n\n262\n00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.540\nIf you've got remote applications,\nmaybe I've got end users, right?\n\n263\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.570\nThat are connecting over the public\nnetwork, the Internet, right?\n\n264\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.360\nAnd they're connecting to a web server.\n\n265\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.350\nAnd then beyond that\nweb server right there.\n\n266\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.940\nThey're running an application that's\nreally just in that centralized location.\n\n267\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.605\nSee that's the other good thing about\nenterprise class software is it doesn't\n\n268\n00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:27.129\nhave to just be limited to a physical\nenvironment with a physical computer you\n\n269\n00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:28.123\ncan sit down at.\n\n270\n00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:30.126\nIf you do have a virtualized\ninfrastructure.\n\n271\n00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:34.730\nIf you have virtualized applications,\na lot of these solutions.\n\n272\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.940\nThey don't, they're not limited to\nonly being this type of environment or\n\n273\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.260\nversus this type of environment.\n\n274\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.440\nYou know?\nThey can be physical, and\n\n275\n00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.940\nthey can be virtual as well.\n\n276\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.100\nSo the virtualization aspect is good too.\n\n277\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.895\nCuz keep in mind, those machines,\nwell they need to be protected as well.\n\n278\n00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.379\nEven though they're on\na centralized machine,\n\n279\n00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:55.358\nthey're an individual instance\nof an operating system.\n\n280\n00:13:55.358 --> 00:14:00.388\nAnd each one of those individual\ninstances can contract viruses.\n\n281\n00:14:00.388 --> 00:14:01.660\nThey can get infected too.\n\n282\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.790\nSo it's really,\n\n283\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.930\nreally good to have something like the\nvirtualization protection that you need.\n\n284\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.280\nNow the other thing that we get,\n\n285\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.070\none of the really cool things when\nwe talk about scalability, right?\n\n286\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.690\nWe got a lot of information\nthat we need to maintain.\n\n287\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.520\nCloud integration, right?\n\n288\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.020\nMaybe your company doesn't\nhave the infrastructure,\n\n289\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.980\nwithin your own network, to support\nsomething to scale up in a large size.\n\n290\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.620\nWell that's where you\nhave software out there\n\n291\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.880\nthat allows you to integrate\nit with the cloud.\n\n292\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.470\nLet's let somebody else manage it.\n\n293\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.060\nRight?\nYou know that your information is secure.\n\n294\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.950\nYour machines are secure because\nyou're offloading it to a third party.\n\n295\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.990\nRight?\nSo cloud integration is great\n\n296\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.590\nand I'm sure.\n\n297\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.280\nSome of you guys are probably\naware out there that\n\n298\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.450\neverything is in the cloud today, right?\n\n299\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.900\nI mean it's just not fair that\nwe've got entire businesses that\n\n300\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.980\nbank on the fact that they don't\nhave to run their networks.\n\n301\n00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.610\nSo as far as salability,\n\n302\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.910\nbeing able to not only protect things\nlike virtualized environments.\n\n303\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.140\nBut also integrate it with your\nexisting cloud technologies.\n\n304\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.065\nAnd that's something I can say that we\nreally, really need to have as well.\n\n305\n00:15:09.065 --> 00:15:11.770\nAnd, as the cloud expands.\n\n306\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.120\nBoy that sounds cliche or a pun.\n\n307\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.321\nBut as the cloud expands, integrating\nacross virtualized environments.\n\n308\n00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:21.338\nCloud integration really\nis gonna be something Dan.\n\n309\n00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:24.593\nThat's gonna be,\nreally I would say probably revolutionary,\n\n310\n00:15:24.593 --> 00:15:26.380\nand more of the way of the future.\n\n311\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.520\n>> Oh yeah, definitely.\n\n312\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.819\nYou're already seeing it today.\n\n313\n00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:31.452\nCloud is obviously, it's here to stay.\n\n314\n00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:35.032\nIt's gonna be basically,\nthe way things go, very, very shortly.\n\n315\n00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:37.478\nAnd you're also starting to see.\n\n316\n00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.263\nYou'll notice that we're getting outside,\nright.\n\n317\n00:15:40.263 --> 00:15:43.854\nWe're moving away from one\narea of operations, aright?\n\n318\n00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:44.822\nThat brings us to what?\n\n319\n00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:46.063\nMobile devices.\n\n320\n00:15:46.063 --> 00:15:48.819\nMobile devices are huge nowadays.\n\n321\n00:15:48.819 --> 00:15:50.040\nWhat are they?\n\n322\n00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.543\nThey're basically just small computers.\n\n323\n00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:54.365\nMy smart phone, Wes' smart phone,\nyour smart phone.\n\n324\n00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:58.264\nIt's just a computer that's been\nshrunk down to an itty-bitty size.\n\n325\n00:15:58.264 --> 00:16:01.445\nDoes that need to have some\nantivirus solution on it?\n\n326\n00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:02.537\nIt sure does.\n\n327\n00:16:02.537 --> 00:16:03.942\nAnd guess what?\n\n328\n00:16:03.942 --> 00:16:06.971\nThat's where our enterprise\nlevel is gonna help us out.\n\n329\n00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:11.188\nBecause not only are we able to work\nwith our laptops, our desktops, but\n\n330\n00:16:11.188 --> 00:16:14.365\nit's gonna cover those\nmobile devices as well.\n\n331\n00:16:14.365 --> 00:16:18.975\n>> Yeah and that's great to have things\nlike what they call MDM technologies.\n\n332\n00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:20.002\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n333\n00:16:20.002 --> 00:16:22.061\nWe have mobile device\nmanagement systems and\n\n334\n00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:24.508\nthere's all different kinds\nout there that we have.\n\n335\n00:16:24.508 --> 00:16:27.475\nAnd when you look at an open\ndevice management solution.\n\n336\n00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:31.351\nIf you're using just a single phone,\nright?\n\n337\n00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:35.295\nYou have a handful of phones, tablets,\nif you will, in your home environment,\n\n338\n00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:36.403\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n339\n00:16:36.403 --> 00:16:40.410\nYou're gonna go to some third party\nconsumer grade software like AVG,\n\n340\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.800\nlike Avast, like Symantec, right?\n\n341\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.670\nAnd that's okay, because they can\ncontrol a handful of devices.\n\n342\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.014\nBut what if you have multiple floors,\nright?\n\n343\n00:16:48.014 --> 00:16:51.937\nWhat if I have more than\njust a single phone, right?\n\n344\n00:16:51.937 --> 00:16:55.613\nI've got a main office that\nhas three floors here,\n\n345\n00:16:55.613 --> 00:16:57.930\nhow we've got a lot of devices.\n\n346\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.590\nNow, you probably already got\nthe picture that we don't wanna have\n\n347\n00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.930\nto go [LAUGH] phone to phone to phone, no\ndifferent than your workstations, right?\n\n348\n00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.290\nNow what if we have even more, right?\n\n349\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.530\nWe have a scalability and\nwe have branch offices.\n\n350\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.210\nWell that's the other thing, right?\n\n351\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.150\nThe other thing is that we can have\na centralized location that all of\n\n352\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:23.240\nthese devices can communicate\nover a public network, right?\n\n353\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.680\nI want the ability that if,\nlet's say Dan's got a phone,\n\n354\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.165\nand he's traveling to another country,\nhe's traveling to another state,\n\n355\n00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:32.105\nif you're here in the states, right?\n\n356\n00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:33.035\nAnd he says, hey,\n\n357\n00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:36.435\nI need an enterprise, or maybe I just\nthink he needs an enterprise scan.\n\n358\n00:17:36.435 --> 00:17:39.585\nI wanna be able to reach out\nacross the Internet there and\n\n359\n00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:43.475\ntell that device,\nyou're gonna perform a scan, right?\n\n360\n00:17:43.475 --> 00:17:46.742\nWhat if Dan calls me up and\nsays, you know what?\n\n361\n00:17:46.742 --> 00:17:49.260\nMy phone's still at the restaurant\nthat we just ate at, right?\n\n362\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.586\nAnd I know, that hey, Dan's one of\nthe administrators on our network.\n\n363\n00:17:52.586 --> 00:17:55.658\nSo the chances are he's probably got\nsome information because he needs\n\n364\n00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:56.845\nto use it as part of his job.\n\n365\n00:17:56.845 --> 00:17:59.480\nWell I don't want to leave\nthat phone out there, right?\n\n366\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.721\nI don't want to potentially get that\ninformation into a competitors hands or\n\n367\n00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:04.773\na thief's hands.\n\n368\n00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:09.455\nWhere we've got identity theft,\nwe've got corporate data that's now lost.\n\n369\n00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:14.080\nWell with the open MDM technologies we\nhave the ability to reach out, all right?\n\n370\n00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.390\nReach out through the Internet,\nover the public network.\n\n371\n00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.140\nAnd we can do things like\nremote data business removal.\n\n372\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.409\nIn fact, be careful with that one because\nthat's actually a Microsoft term,\n\n373\n00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:24.756\nremote business data removal.\n\n374\n00:18:24.756 --> 00:18:27.409\nIt's one of the capabilities\nof things like\n\n375\n00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:31.507\nthe System Center Configuration Manager,\nMicrosoft's InTune.\n\n376\n00:18:31.507 --> 00:18:33.715\nAnd it's not just with Microsoft, too.\n\n377\n00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:35.280\nA lot of these have this.\n\n378\n00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.105\nTrend Micro's got mobile device\nmanagement, Kaspersky's got it.\n\n379\n00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:41.265\nBeing able to reach out\nacross the Internet and\n\n380\n00:18:41.265 --> 00:18:44.460\nsay, you know what,\nthat data that's on Dan's phone.\n\n381\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.150\nFirst of all, we're gonna lock the device.\n\n382\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.610\nWe're gonna make sure that if\nanybody hasn't found it yet, or\n\n383\n00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.050\neven if they have found it,\nwe're gonna put a hold on that device.\n\n384\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.600\nAnd then if they try to, let's say,\n\n385\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.880\nplug the USB cable in cuz they're gonna\ntry to do some reverse engineering,\n\n386\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.040\nat least it'll give us a chance\nto eradicate that information.\n\n387\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.940\nSo, the mobile device management,\n\n388\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.550\nin situations where we've got a lot of\nBYOD, bring your own device, right?\n\n389\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:13.705\nI was listening to one time a statistics\nthat said I think by the end of like 2020,\n\n390\n00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:19.410\nwe're gonna have 50 billion devices\non TCP/IP networks worldwide.\n\n391\n00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.570\nBillions, right?\n\n392\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.650\nIf you think our population of the earth,\nwhat, a few years back,\n\n393\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.930\nI don't know how long it's been now,\nhit 7 billion 50 billion devices, right?\n\n394\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.065\nSo, the rapid growth.\n\n395\n00:19:33.065 --> 00:19:35.640\nI mean it's just not a trend,\nI mean it, well I guess it is.\n\n396\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.110\nBut the rapid growth, the accelerated\npace that things like tablets,\n\n397\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.600\nthings like phones, well,\ncell phones if you will.\n\n398\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.760\nAll of these mobile devices.\n\n399\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.313\nAnd I always thought why don't\nwe just call it la-tablet-phone?\n\n400\n00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.227\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then we've got our laptop, tablet and\n\n401\n00:19:50.227 --> 00:19:51.440\nphone and we'll be just fine.\n\n402\n00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.089\nAnd we don't have to be confused anymore.\n\n403\n00:19:53.089 --> 00:19:55.250\nBut we can control these devices too.\n\n404\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.345\nSo things like your MDM technologies,\nhaving that mobile device management\n\n405\n00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:03.251\nauthority that the devices can register\nand make it easy and simplistic,\n\n406\n00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:06.770\ntransparent to your end users,\nthat now they have the devices.\n\n407\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.710\nAnd sure, they may or may not be worried\nabout losing your corporate data or\n\n408\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.790\nwhether they get a virus or\nnot, but as administrators?\n\n409\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.910\nThe administrators want to make sure that\nthey keep in compliance with the security\n\n410\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.500\npolicy, right?\n\n411\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.490\nYou have a security policy.\n\n412\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.853\nYou have to meet that security policy.\n\n413\n00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:25.030\nAnd I'll tell you right now, there's not\nreally gonna be a way that the consumer\n\n414\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.547\ngrade software can make sure that\nthose security policies are met.\n\n415\n00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:31.110\nSo that's why you do have to go\ninto the enterprise technologies.\n\n416\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.380\n>> Yeah, you mentioned the BYOD,\nthe bring your own device.\n\n417\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.937\nVery, very common nowadays.\n\n418\n00:20:35.937 --> 00:20:38.100\nIt's highly unlikely anymore.\n\n419\n00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.830\nIt still happens, but\nit's becoming less and less of a trend.\n\n420\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.540\nIs that you're given, or you're issued,\na phone from your manager, or whatever,\n\n421\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.370\nespecially in IT, right?\n\n422\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.170\nEverybody has a smartphone already.\n\n423\n00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.600\nWhy do they need to invest in buying\nsmart phones for their employees?\n\n424\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.170\nThey already have one.\n\n425\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.170\nWe just want to integrate\nthat device into our network.\n\n426\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.550\nBYOD, that's what that's all about.\n\n427\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.610\nThat being said,\nwe're talking about covering this.\n\n428\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.750\nA lot of times you'll implement what's\ncalled a network access control, or\n\n429\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.280\na NAC for short, in your environment.\n\n430\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.932\nA lot of times these\nenterprise level solutions,\n\n431\n00:21:11.932 --> 00:21:15.537\nthey will integrate with that if\nnot provide it completely for you.\n\n432\n00:21:15.537 --> 00:21:20.513\nAnd Wes, this is probably one of the major\nbig deal features inside of our enterprise\n\n433\n00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:21.297\nsolutions?\n\n434\n00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:23.070\n>> Definitely, think about this, right?\n\n435\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.267\nYou've got a laptop.\n\n436\n00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:25.486\nAnd it's not your laptop.\n\n437\n00:21:25.486 --> 00:21:27.900\nmight be a company perspective right here,\nokay?\n\n438\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.422\nYou've got a laptop, you've issued\nit out to an end user, right?\n\n439\n00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.910\nAnd it's not just laptops.\n\n440\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.690\nWe're talking workstations as well.\n\n441\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.092\nBut laptops, I mean they're mobile, right?\n\n442\n00:21:36.092 --> 00:21:39.520\nThey tend to, in a business environment,\nhop between networks.\n\n443\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.190\nWell, what if they hop on that\npublic Wi-Fi hotspot, right?\n\n444\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.807\nAnd I don't mean this like they're\ndoing anything maliciously, but\n\n445\n00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:51.065\nyou don't know what's going on\nin that Wi-Fi hotspot there.\n\n446\n00:21:51.065 --> 00:21:54.099\nAnd if they're traveling they're\ngoing to different states,\n\n447\n00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:57.655\nmaybe going to different countries there,\nand they're doing business.\n\n448\n00:21:57.655 --> 00:22:02.355\nWell there's an increased chance or\nand increased likelihood that\n\n449\n00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:06.775\nthey're going to potentially catch some\nkind of virus or piece of malware.\n\n450\n00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:10.085\nWell, what happens when they bring\nthat device back to your network?\n\n451\n00:22:10.085 --> 00:22:11.070\nAll right, and\n\n452\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.690\nyou probably got things like your Wi-Fi\nnetwork's gonna automatically connect.\n\n453\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.962\nWell, wouldn't it be nice to have a way\nthat when that device connects to your\n\n454\n00:22:19.962 --> 00:22:24.235\nnetwork, that the first thing it does,\nis it reaches out over the network and\n\n455\n00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:27.484\nit sends something called\na statement of health, right.\n\n456\n00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:29.592\nThis is what I've got going on right now.\n\n457\n00:22:29.592 --> 00:22:36.600\nI've got my antivirus software installed,\nturned on, the definitions are up to date.\n\n458\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.285\nI've got a firewall turned on.\n\n459\n00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:40.760\nIt's configured.\n\n460\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.720\nWe've got patch management has happened.\n\n461\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.323\nWe've got our updates,\nif your in Windows, right?\n\n462\n00:22:44.323 --> 00:22:47.903\nYou've got your Windows updates happening,\nthey're installed,\n\n463\n00:22:47.903 --> 00:22:49.327\nall the security patches.\n\n464\n00:22:49.327 --> 00:22:52.050\nIf you're using things like\nWindows Defender, integrates.\n\n465\n00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.970\nWouldn't be nice to have a way that we\ncould connect that device to the network\n\n466\n00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.330\nand have it communicate\nwith another servers?\n\n467\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.610\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n468\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.860\nA lot times these technologies will\nhave a database of policies, right?\n\n469\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.840\nAnd that policy is gonna be some kind\nof network access policy if you will.\n\n470\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.000\nJust like Dan said,\nnetwork access control.\n\n471\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.092\nA network policy or\nmaybe even a health policy.\n\n472\n00:23:15.092 --> 00:23:18.622\nAnd they can correlate to each other,\nwhere it says the health policy states\n\n473\n00:23:18.622 --> 00:23:21.060\nthat you have to have\nyour firewall turned on.\n\n474\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.156\nYou have to have those things.\n\n475\n00:23:22.156 --> 00:23:26.480\nThe antivirus, the firewall,\nready to go and in good shape.\n\n476\n00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.470\nWell, when your device communicates\nwith that management system, all right?\n\n477\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.910\nNow, the management system can\nalso perform scans as well, but\n\n478\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.250\nwhen it communicates with\nthat management system,\n\n479\n00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.330\nthe management system hands it over\nto a policy that you've created.\n\n480\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.755\nAnd says, okay, well let's compare that to\nwhat this laptop in this case, as example,\n\n481\n00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:46.115\nis telling me, all right?\n\n482\n00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:49.850\nIt says, okay, the policy says\nwe've got the firewall turned on.\n\n483\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.780\nWell, let me look here.\n\n484\n00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.622\nThe firewall's turned on.\n\n485\n00:23:51.622 --> 00:23:55.523\nIt says you have to have\nthe antivirus software installed, and\n\n486\n00:23:55.523 --> 00:23:57.210\nit has to be up to date.\n\n487\n00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.300\nWell, we look at that.\n\n488\n00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.479\nThat's good to go.\n\n489\n00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:02.406\nBut we've got a few computers here,\nin our networks, and\n\n490\n00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:04.274\nit doesn't have to just be laptops.\n\n491\n00:24:04.274 --> 00:24:06.457\nAnd they don't have their updates.\n\n492\n00:24:06.457 --> 00:24:08.151\nTheir updates haven't happened.\n\n493\n00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:11.531\nFor whatever reason,\nthe security updates have failed.\n\n494\n00:24:11.531 --> 00:24:15.061\nA lot of times you might say, well,\nwait a second, that's somebody maliciously\n\n495\n00:24:15.061 --> 00:24:17.890\nsaying, well, I know what I'm doing and\nI'm not gonna update.\n\n496\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.150\nNot necessarily.\n\n497\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.850\nA lot of updates, especially in the\nWindows environments, require restarts.\n\n498\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.720\nSo the update is there.\n\n499\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.430\nBut it's pending a restart.\n\n500\n00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.680\nWell, guess what?\n\n501\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.700\nIn these enterprise technologies,\nmanagement systems can also perform their\n\n502\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.460\nown scans and they can reach out and\nthey can say, well you know what?\n\n503\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.890\nI see we got a series of\ncomputers here that are no longer\n\n504\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.680\nin compliance with the policy.\n\n505\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.210\nSo what happens here?\n\n506\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.540\nWell, the good thing is\nwe can isolate them.\n\n507\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.010\nWe can isolate these devices\nthrough this technology, and\n\n508\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.920\nthat's something that's really,\nreally good to have is the fact\n\n509\n00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.520\nthat we can do that to where they\ncan't communicate with other devices.\n\n510\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.410\nNow, Dan, I'm gonna change this up\na little bit or I'm gonna switch this up.\n\n511\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.020\nI'm gonna switch gears on here because I\nreally want to talk about something known\n\n512\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.540\nas quarantine networks, all right.\n\n513\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.670\nAnd that's where the quarantine\nnetwork comes in, right?\n\n514\n00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:16.520\nWhat do we have?\n\n515\n00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.210\nWell, these series of computers,\nright, they don't meet the policy.\n\n516\n00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.870\nWhether it's your mobile devices,\nwhether it's your laptops.\n\n517\n00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.290\nMaybe it's your workstation\nwaiting on a pending restart.\n\n518\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.320\nJust to finish the installation\nof that update.\n\n519\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.710\nWell that's where we get things\nlike enforcement actions.\n\n520\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.660\nAnd since I've looked at the policy,\nI've compared it.\n\n521\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.880\nI've compared the network access policy,\n\n522\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.980\nthat just simply states,\ngotta meet the health policy.\n\n523\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.460\nSo now we've got the eye in the sky,\nproverbially,\n\n524\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.890\nsaying let's go ahead and\nperform some enforcement action.\n\n525\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.190\nAnd what do they do?\n\n526\n00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.170\nAll of these devices get kicked off\nto a quarantine network, right.\n\n527\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.270\nThey get isolated to\nthis quarantine network.\n\n528\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.160\nAll right now, what's a quarantine\nnetwork gonna do for us?\n\n529\n00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.660\nWell, inside of the quarantine network,\nI want you to notice something.\n\n530\n00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.820\nThese machines get locked down except for\none.\n\n531\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.600\nApparently, I forgot to put\nthe lock icon on that one.\n\n532\n00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.870\nNotice that it's a logical network.\n\n533\n00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.780\nAnd what this does for us is, it says,\nif you haven't met the policy,\n\n534\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:24.050\nif you're not in the health state\nthat we're requiring you to be in,\n\n535\n00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.240\nnotice you're not gonna communicate\noutbound of this network at all.\n\n536\n00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.920\nAll of the outbound\ncommunication is blocked.\n\n537\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.910\nBut does that mean that they\ncan't communicate at all?\n\n538\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:35.960\nNo, not at all.\n\n539\n00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.920\nWe don't want them communicating with\nother devices on our networks, right?\n\n540\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.250\nBecause they could potentially infect\nthose devices that do meet the policies.\n\n541\n00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.830\nSo what do we do?\n\n542\n00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.110\nWhen they're in the quarantine\nnetwork we put things like\n\n543\n00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.510\npatch management servers, right?\n\n544\n00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.160\nPatch servers, update servers.\n\n545\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.570\nIt doesn't just have to be\nsomething specific like\n\n546\n00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:57.330\nWindows Server Update Service like a WSUS\nserver, some of these technologies\n\n547\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.780\nhave the ability to manage updates\ninternally in the software itself, right?\n\n548\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.080\nSo we put one of those servers in\nthe quarantine network, right?\n\n549\n00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.950\nWe don't allow the outbound communication\nbut we do allow them if it's, for\n\n550\n00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.780\ninstance, an update that we think.\n\n551\n00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.070\nCommunicate with that server.\n\n552\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.110\nPerform your updates.\n\n553\n00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.370\nPerform your restarts.\n\n554\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.850\nMaybe it's a definition database.\n\n555\n00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:21.140\nMaybe they said, you know what,\nyou don't have the current updates.\n\n556\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:26.220\nWell, when they hit the quarantine\nnetwork, we have a server in there that\n\n557\n00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.035\nhas the definitions so\nthat they can communicate and\n\n558\n00:27:29.035 --> 00:27:33.325\nthey can update their definitions and\nmaybe that's the portion of compliance.\n\n559\n00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:35.775\nAnd that gets us down to\nthe compliance monitor, right?\n\n560\n00:27:35.775 --> 00:27:39.435\nWe've got a server and guys, I've got\nthis separated out into three servers,\n\n561\n00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:42.245\nthat's really just for display purposes.\n\n562\n00:27:42.245 --> 00:27:44.475\nWe really could take all of\nthese functionalities and\n\n563\n00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:47.215\ncombine them into a single server\nperforming multiple roles.\n\n564\n00:27:47.215 --> 00:27:51.040\nSo don't think that it has to be\na lot of extra infrastructure.\n\n565\n00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.780\nTypically is a lot of infrastructure\nif you're going this far.\n\n566\n00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.820\nBut we also have some kind of\ncompliance monitor that says,\n\n567\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.380\nall right, your antivirus solution\nwasn't where it needed to be.\n\n568\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.320\nYou've not running this security\nhotfix that needs to be there.\n\n569\n00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.880\nIt blocked some kind of zero\nday exploit that we found.\n\n570\n00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.960\nSo it turns around and\n\n571\n00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.760\nit says, all right, are you compliant\nnow with the health policy?\n\n572\n00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.970\nWhen you are compliant\nwith the health policy,\n\n573\n00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.950\nwell then we just go to the fact\nthat we've remediated the clients.\n\n574\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.510\nAll right, and when the clients\nare remediated, now it's checked.\n\n575\n00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:30.590\nThe management system performs the scans\nagain after they've been remediated and\n\n576\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.430\nwe can see things like the fact\nthat these computers that\n\n577\n00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.420\nweren't in compliance before, well,\nnow they're a safer system, right?\n\n578\n00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.800\nNow they've got their antivirus,\ntheir definitions are up to date.\n\n579\n00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.510\nIf it happened to be a service turned off,\nI don't know if you've ever seen this,\n\n580\n00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.770\nDan, but sometimes those Windows\nservices randomly for whatever reason,\n\n581\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.800\nhappens a lot on servers like DHCP and\nDNS.\n\n582\n00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.530\nThe service just turns off for\nwhatever reason.\n\n583\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.735\n>> Like the mid service?\n\n584\n00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:53.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n585\n00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.470\n>> That's one of the favorite things\nto not be running on a computer.\n\n586\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.540\n>> Exactly.\nSo\n\n587\n00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.630\nit could just be something as simple\nas a restart that starts that service.\n\n588\n00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.795\nAnd that's the other thing.\n\n589\n00:29:01.795 --> 00:29:05.505\nBeing able to reach out and\nsay if it's just a restart that's pending\n\n590\n00:29:05.505 --> 00:29:10.195\nto update that, update the update [LAUGH]\nto finish the installation of the update.\n\n591\n00:29:10.195 --> 00:29:12.145\nWell, we reach out across the network and\n\n592\n00:29:12.145 --> 00:29:16.465\nthese six computers that still need\nthat restart, we force them to restart.\n\n593\n00:29:16.465 --> 00:29:18.295\nOr, if it's during production hours,\n\n594\n00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:22.295\nmaybe we send the end user a prompt,\na customized message, right?\n\n595\n00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:26.180\nA customized message that says,\nyour security team or\n\n596\n00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.070\nyour administrator is\nperforming a restart,\n\n597\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.968\nit's gonna happen within the next five to\nten minutes, save all your work right?\n\n598\n00:29:31.968 --> 00:29:34.340\nHit your Ctrl+S and\nclose that stuff down so\n\n599\n00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.170\nyou don't lose information,\nor maybe we schedule it.\n\n600\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:38.910\nThat's another thing,\n\n601\n00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.220\nwe can schedule it to happen too to\nwhere it happens off hours right?\n\n602\n00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.530\nWe can schedule it for 1 AM.\n\n603\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.800\nNow, if you're the administrator out\nthere, you're probably working at 1 AM, so\n\n604\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.180\nyou might not want to restart your\nown machine, but we can do that and\n\n605\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.210\nwe don't have to worry about\nit affecting the end user.\n\n606\n00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.000\nSo a lot of flexibility with these.\n\n607\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.870\nA lot of flexibility that you can\ncontrol on a massive level, or\n\n608\n00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.170\neven down to a smaller level,\nyou can control those endpoints and you\n\n609\n00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:07.580\ndon't have to get up from your computer\nand walk to the other computer to do it.\n\n610\n00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.690\n>> Yes, very, very good.\n\n611\n00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:13.090\nObviously, there is a huge\nbenefit to deploying something\n\n612\n00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.105\nlike an enterprise level solution,\nespecially when you're in an enterprise\n\n613\n00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:20.180\nleveltType of business environment, that\nis something you're going to wanna do.\n\n614\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.410\nBecause otherwise, it would just be an\nimpossible task, you would just be tilting\n\n615\n00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.290\nat windmills all day long,\nfighting foes and unable to defeat them.\n\n616\n00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.806\nIt would just be craziness, and I'm glad\nthat we have this centralized management.\n\n617\n00:30:33.806 --> 00:30:37.155\nWes, is there anything else about the\nenterprise level management systems that\n\n618\n00:30:37.155 --> 00:30:38.150\nwe would need to know?\n\n619\n00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.310\n>> Yeah, a couple other things\nthat I wanna touch base on and\n\n620\n00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.400\njust make sure that we understand is that\nyou have mission critical functionality on\n\n621\n00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.080\nyour networks, right?\n\n622\n00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.820\nA lot of times, and guys, we've got\nplenty of episodes out there that talk on\n\n623\n00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.320\nwhat servers are doing for us, but\n\n624\n00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.970\nremember that they're providing a resource\nor a service to your network, right?\n\n625\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.220\nWe have things like file servers, like\nyour email servers, like your web servers,\n\n626\n00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.780\nlike your internet gateways that are\ncontrolling all of the information coming\n\n627\n00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.270\noff of the Internet into your network and\nall those hundreds,\n\n628\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.190\nif not thousands of computers.\n\n629\n00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:11.760\nWell, this type of software isn't limited\nto just your workstations, right?\n\n630\n00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.380\nIt's gonna help as well protect\n\n631\n00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.790\nthose mission critical computers\nout there on your network.\n\n632\n00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.330\nAnd I think, Dan,\n\n633\n00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.800\none of the last things I wanna mention is,\napplication whitelisting, right?\n\n634\n00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.860\nThis is one of the things that you\nalso have to be able to do too.\n\n635\n00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.880\nWhen you do things like heuristic scans,\nright?\n\n636\n00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:33.180\nOn a small scale in your home environment,\nif it blocks maybe your Facebook or\n\n637\n00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.260\nyour Skype call or something like that,\nit's okay, Yyou just go in there and\n\n638\n00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.470\nyou turn that one application off.\n\n639\n00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.850\nBut what if you have an entire line of\nbusiness software that half of your\n\n640\n00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.900\ncompany relies on?\n\n641\n00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.440\nOr there's communication from that\napplication to another application.\n\n642\n00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.960\nAnd when you send heuristic scans out\nthere, it marks all of those applications\n\n643\n00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.430\nas false positives and\nit breaks half your network.\n\n644\n00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.860\nWell, we need a way to get that software\nback online really quick without\n\n645\n00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.110\nhaving to go to each computer.\n\n646\n00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.220\nIn a small environment,\n\n647\n00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.930\nwe're probably just going to go\nto each individual computer.\n\n648\n00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.500\nWe can't do that on a large scale,\nso it's good to have that ability,\n\n649\n00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.340\nthat if it does flag one\nof your processes or\n\n650\n00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.630\none of your applications as being a virus\nyou can turn around and say no no, no.\n\n651\n00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.650\nThat's okay.\n\n652\n00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.640\nWe like him, he's on our team.\n\n653\n00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.580\nLet's go ahead and\nlet that application run.\n\n654\n00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.040\nAnd you also have that capability\non that administration server.\n\n655\n00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.800\nSo it's one of the things that\nyou have to keep in mind too.\n\n656\n00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.710\nBecause it could make or\nbreak your company.\n\n657\n00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.840\nSo application whitelisting was something\nelse there we needed to manage.\n\n658\n00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.635\n>> Oh yeah,\nit's quite a big deal a matter of fact.\n\n659\n00:32:39.635 --> 00:32:42.050\nCuz you will be white\nlisting some applications.\n\n660\n00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.170\nI don't care who you are as long\nas you got large enough business.\n\n661\n00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.770\nYou're gonna have some third party app or\n\n662\n00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.970\nsome crazy thing that you bought because\nthat's what your company relies on.\n\n663\n00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.230\nAnd it's gonna flag.\n\n664\n00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.170\nIt's gonna false positive\nthat thing all day.\n\n665\n00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.040\nSo you're gonna need to take care of that.\n\n666\n00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.990\nWes, this has been an awesome introduction\nto why we need to take a look\n\n667\n00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.650\nat enterprise level solutions.\n\n668\n00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.500\nI really look forward to seeing\nhow will these things work\n\n669\n00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.540\nout looking all the different\nproducts that we're gonna play with.\n\n670\n00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.700\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n671\n00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.590\nThank you so much for\n\n672\n00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.300\nshowing us this, giving that explanation\nto us, and thank you guys so much for\n\n673\n00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.420\nwatching this episode, but\nit is time to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n674\n00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.580\nI've been your host, Daniel

to\nanother great episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:20.394\nI'm you're host Daniel Lowrie and\nin todays episode,well,\n\n5\n00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:23.374\nwe're gonna keep taking\na look at our anti-virus,\n\n6\n00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:28.350\nanti-malware solutions and continuing on\nwith those enterprise level solutions.\n\n7\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.950\nJoining us,\n\n8\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.920\nlending his expertise on today's show, is\ndone under my good friend, Mr. Les Bryant.\n\n9\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.400\nLes, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.220\nHow the heck are you sir?\n\n11\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.370\n>> I'm doing good Dan, and as always,\nthank you for having me back on stage and\n\n12\n00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.260\nthat's right, we're gonna be looking at\none called McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator.\n\n13\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.890\nAnd this is another one of the enterprise\nlevel solutions that can scale up to\n\n14\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.800\na very, very large environment, in fact,\nlarge enough that you could even have\n\n15\n00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.680\ndistribution technologies to scale\nthis across it, well really,\n\n16\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.370\nthe world if you want to.\n\n17\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.110\nNow let's go ahead,\n\n18\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.660\nI'll tell you what Dan,\nI think we'll just dive right into this.\n\n19\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.170\nOne of the things that you have to do\nis make a slight registry modification.\n\n20\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.950\nLet's show you what's going on there.\n\n21\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.710\nI've already gone ahead and\ndownloaded the software here.\n\n22\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.820\nAnd one of the things that you'll see\nright away when we start to load up\n\n23\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.600\nthe ePolicy Orchestrator is that it's\ngoing to require an older naming\n\n24\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.920\nconvention, a file naming convention,\nlet me be specific on that one.\n\n25\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.560\nWhen you do the installation\nit's going to fail.\n\n26\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.040\nAnd I'd really like to just show\nyou how it fails first, and\n\n27\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.420\nthen I'll show you how to correct it.\n\n28\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.640\nNow when you do registry modifications,\nbe very careful because\n\n29\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.830\nthe registry, you really don't get a,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n30\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.494\nAre you really sure you wanna do this,\nwell if you wanna do this go ahead but\n\n31\n00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:55.334\nbe careful.\n\n32\n00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:56.793\nNo, it doesn't work that way.\n\n33\n00:01:56.793 --> 00:02:01.903\nWhen you make a registry modification,\nfor better or worse,\n\n34\n00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:07.014\nit's instantaneously implemented,\nand the other thing too\n\n35\n00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:12.043\nis it really wants the display\nto be 1024 by 768 here.\n\n36\n00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:15.160\nLet's go ahead and here's that warning\nthat I was telling you guys about.\n\n37\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.334\nLook at what it says.\n\n38\n00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:20.061\nThe 8.3 naming convention and it's gonna,\n\n39\n00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:24.780\nit's actually gonna cancel our\ninstallation, it's gonna shut it down.\n\n40\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.790\nNow this is a naming convention that goes\nback to the to the days of DOS and MS-DOS\n\n41\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.820\nand it's been disabled on your server so,\nyou have to make a modification here.\n\n42\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.979\nSo, we're gonna go in and\n\n43\n00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.001\nwhat were gonna do guys is we're\ngonna launch our registry editor.\n\n44\n00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.111\nAgain, be careful when you\nmake registry modifications,\n\n45\n00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.670\nbecause you notice I\ndidn't get a warning here.\n\n46\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.030\nIt's probably a good idea,\nguys, to back up your registry\n\n47\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.940\nsettings as they currently\nare before you make a modification.\n\n48\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.300\nSo that if you do make some kind of,\nI guess,\n\n49\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.480\nerror in your modifications,\nyou can always import your back-up there.\n\n50\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.010\nNow, this is gonna be way\ndown in the registry here.\n\n51\n00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.150\nAnd let me kind of zoom in here so\nyou guys can see what's going on.\n\n52\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.168\nYou'll see that we're\nin HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.\n\n53\n00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:13.580\nAnd I took you into Software,\nthat's not where it is.\n\n54\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.270\nIt's actually in System here.\n\n55\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.894\nAnd your ControlSets, you know,\n\n56\n00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:20.480\nwe use these in recovery situations\nwhere we restore to the last known good.\n\n57\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.130\nThis is actually in CurrentControlSet.\n\n58\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.430\nNow once we expand out CurrentControlSet,\n\n59\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.210\nyou will see that there is control here,\nand I'll expand this out guys.\n\n60\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.270\nMake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n61\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.290\nI know that the registry here,\n\n62\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.385\nthese locations, well they really\ndon't make it easy on the eyes.\n\n63\n00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.805\nThat's for sure and I've had four\neyes since the second grade so\n\n64\n00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.334\nI can sympathize out there.\n\n65\n00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.589\nSo you'll see that we're\nin HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE so\n\n66\n00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.087\nthis is hardware configuration.\n\n67\n00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:50.057\nWe're in the system.\n\n68\n00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:52.137\nWe're in the CurrentControlSet, and\n\n69\n00:03:52.137 --> 00:03:56.207\nthen we're in Control and then, I hope\nwe're in control we're gonna find out, and\n\n70\n00:03:56.207 --> 00:04:02.787\nthen all the way down here at the bottom\nyou'll see that there is a FileSystem.\n\n71\n00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:07.867\nSo remember that location if you're\ngonna install the ePolicy server.\n\n72\n00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:13.959\nNow the registry value or key that I\nwant to modify is the one right here.\n\n73\n00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.315\nAnd we'll definitely take a look at that\none cuz you wanna make sure that you\n\n74\n00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:18.334\nmodify the right one.\n\n75\n00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:24.110\nNotice it says NtfsDisable8.3NameCreation.\n\n76\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.070\nIt's a shortened naming convention.\n\n77\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.900\nNow when you go in here,\nyou'll see that the default value is 2.\n\n78\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.910\nYou might see the default\nvalue is somethings else but\n\n79\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.210\nwhat it has to be to enable this\nthe default value has to changed to zero.\n\n80\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.180\nAnd we'll go ahead and do this.\n\n81\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.010\nNow, what are the things that you'll\nalso see, notice it didn't warn me so\n\n82\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.590\nI'm hoping then that was\nthe right modification there.\n\n83\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.120\nAll right.\n\n84\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.220\nNow, we'll go ahead and\nclose down the registry editor.\n\n85\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.680\nYou could restart\nthe computer if you want.\n\n86\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.810\nIn fact,\nif you look at some of the documentation,\n\n87\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.330\nthey're gonna tell you to\nrestart the server here.\n\n88\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.915\nI found that you really don't\nhave to restart the server.\n\n89\n00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:03.655\nYou're not going to be implementing or\nchanging anything.\n\n90\n00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:06.255\nBut just keep in mind\nthat your control set is\n\n91\n00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:10.175\nupdated to the last known\nconfiguration after you restart.\n\n92\n00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:14.105\nSo it really is a good idea, so\nyou should keep that control set valid.\n\n93\n00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.455\nNow, all we're gonna do is just\nrestart the installation here.\n\n94\n00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:21.792\nI've extracted the files and\nicon, kinda hard to see there, so\n\n95\n00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:25.501\nwe'll zoom in just to set\nup applications setup here.\n\n96\n00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:29.780\nAnd we'll go ahead and click on this and\nagain it's not really gonna like\n\n97\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.782\nthe resolution that I have here and\nthat's just because it's gonna\n\n98\n00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:38.084\nuse web interface and the web interface,\nit can get cut off a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:38.084 --> 00:05:44.490\nSo, do have it in some kind\nof 768 resolution there.\n\n100\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.480\nNow, it didn't give me that warning\nanymore, so it's checked, so\n\n101\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.300\nour registry modification\nwent through okay.\n\n102\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.530\nWe'll choose Next on this.\n\n103\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.740\nAll right.\n\n104\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.750\nNow with some of these installations,\n\n105\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.690\ndepending on how large your environment\nis, how distributed it's gonna be.\n\n106\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.870\nAnd when I say distributed,\nit's really the repositories,\n\n107\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.570\nwhere it stores your information,\n\n108\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.690\nwhere it stores your DAT files, basically\nyour signatures or your definitions.\n\n109\n00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.030\nThat's really, can be distributed.\n\n110\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.780\nYou can use things like file\nreplication technologies\n\n111\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.810\nacross things like your WAN links.\n\n112\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.030\nIf you have multiple LANs\nin different locations and\n\n113\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.510\nyou're geographically dispersed\neverywhere, well you might have a case and\n\n114\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.040\nscenario where your management\nserver isn't in the branch office.\n\n115\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.120\nBut you still want your clients to be\nable to connect to it to get to those\n\n116\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.140\nrepositories to update.\n\n117\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.940\nSo, if you're scaling to a larger\nenvironment, you're probably gonna wanna\n\n118\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.910\nuse the custom, because then what you're\ngonna do is you're gonna implement\n\n119\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.170\nsomething like, you know,\nif you're in a Windows environment and\n\n120\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.250\nyou're Supporting Windows,\nyou might have a Microsoft SQL server.\n\n121\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.376\nI believe it also supports MySQL as well.\n\n122\n00:06:52.376 --> 00:06:54.703\nSo we're gonna do\nthe express installation,\n\n123\n00:06:54.703 --> 00:06:58.830\nbecause what that's does is that just\nsays okay, it's a smaller installation.\n\n124\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.940\nJust have that database within\nthe administrative server and\n\n125\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.090\nthen we really don't have\nto mess with it too much.\n\n126\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.330\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n127\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.200\nAnd what it's gonna do in couple\nof prerequisites that it needs.\n\n128\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.110\nNow the good thing is guys you don't have\nto go out and download these individually.\n\n129\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.920\nIt's gonna do this for you.\n\n130\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.012\nSo it's gonna,\n\n131\n00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:23.260\nyou'll see the different additions of\nthe C ++ redistributable packages.\n\n132\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.878\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Next on this.\n\n133\n00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:30.760\nAnd it's gonna go through the process\nof installing those packages for us.\n\n134\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.380\nDan, we've got a machine here that's\nalready gone through the installation of\n\n135\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.260\nthose prerequisites, if I can say that\nright, that we needed to get done,\n\n136\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.830\nyou know, for\ninstance those C++ distributable packages.\n\n137\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.500\nNow, the second part of the installation\n\n138\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.290\nhere is going to be\nthe configuration of the database.\n\n139\n00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.940\nNow when I say configuration of\nthe database, this is the good thing about\n\n140\n00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.980\nusing the express installation,\nyou only need to set the password.\n\n141\n00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.130\nWe've got our administrator here and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n142\n00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.368\nSo we'll set up our super secret password.\n\n143\n00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:06.853\nAnd it'll verify that information\nright now while it’s looking for data,\n\n144\n00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.410\nit’s looking the same hey.\n\n145\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.810\nThe port's that we where gonna use for\nthat database Zrich.\n\n146\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.580\nLet me check sir.\n\n147\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.600\nWe will make sure that they\nare not already in use.\n\n148\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.020\nWe don't get a conflict\nwith other software.\n\n149\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.990\nNow that's the database administrator\nthere is a couple of administrator to get\n\n150\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.520\nset here that they can, you know,\n\n151\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.720\nit can get a little bit twisty as\nto which one you're setting here.\n\n152\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.070\nThe first one was just\nthe database server.\n\n153\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.360\nThis one is what's known as\nthe global administrator, and\n\n154\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.320\nI know you guys can read that.\n\n155\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.010\nThis is the administrator that administers\nto the entire e-policy server.\n\n156\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.780\nAll right, so\na couple of different passwords here, and\n\n157\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.380\nI'm just gonna set again\nanother super secret password.\n\n158\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.910\nDot dot dot dot dot dot.\n\n159\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.230\nAnd now we'll go ahead and continue on.\n\n160\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.790\nNow if you have purchased this.\n\n161\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.910\nOne of the great things is if you don't\nknow if wanna use the e-policy server,\n\n162\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.120\nyou wanna find out.\n\n163\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.840\nIs this gonna be adequate for\nmy environment?\n\n164\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.720\nWell that's okay,\nyou don't have to add a license key.\n\n165\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.200\nSome software that you'll get,\neven if you get a trial they'll give\n\n166\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.120\nyou a trial activation key and\nit'll already have a 90 day.\n\n167\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.960\nThis one is a 90 day but it doesn't\nrequire you got, let's say to their web\n\n168\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.840\nserver or their website and\nget that before you even start the trial.\n\n169\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.320\nSo, I'm not gonna put\nthe license key here.\n\n170\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.589\nWhat I'm gonna do, guys, is I'm just\ngonna check the evaluation side of this.\n\n171\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.050\nAnd when we choose the evaluation and\nnext it should give us some information.\n\n172\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.310\nAnd there you go it tells you\nit's an evaluation copy and\n\n173\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.340\ngives us about three months to use it.\n\n174\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.950\nAnd you'll see some other\nepisodes that we've talked about\n\n175\n00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.710\nin some of the enterprise\ntechnologies you really do need.\n\n176\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.420\nA little bit of time, right,\nwhen it's at a quarter,\n\n177\n00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.970\nbecause you really need to\nassess your environment.\n\n178\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.640\nThe larger your environment,\ntypically the longer it's gonna take to\n\n179\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.750\nreally know if this software is\nwhat's adequate for your business.\n\n180\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.810\nSo we'll continue along.\n\n181\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.770\nAll right.\n\n182\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.200\nWe've got our end user license agreement,\nas we always do,\n\n183\n00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.690\nand we'll choose okay to that.\n\n184\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.290\nAnd we'll choose next and\nnow phase 2 of the installation Dan,\n\n185\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.790\nthis is installation\nthe sequel [LAUGH] we had.\n\n186\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.580\n>> Draw blood right?\n\n187\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.959\n>> That's right so\n\n188\n00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:19.570\nwe've set the database up,\n>> we've done some of the preliminary\n\n189\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.230\nconfigurations, the administrative\npasswords.\n\n190\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.060\nAnd now what it's going to do is it's\ngoing to go through the install process\n\n191\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.720\nof configuring the server and\ninstalling the e-policy orchestrator.\n\n192\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.280\nNow we see the installation happening.\n\n193\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.350\nWe're just going to go ahead and\nlet it finish it's install and\n\n194\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.760\nthen we'll start the configurations here.\n\n195\n00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.840\nWe've saved some time here.\n\n196\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.390\nWe've got the installation\nfinished on another machine here.\n\n197\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.550\nThe policy is ready to go, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and say yes,\n\n198\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.070\nI want to launch e-policy orchestrator.\n\n199\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.620\nSo we'll go ahead and launch this up here.\n\n200\n00:10:57.171 --> 00:11:00.075\nAnd we'll tell Internet Explorer\nask me later, and\n\n201\n00:11:00.075 --> 00:11:02.390\nhere's where that resolution comes in.\n\n202\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.650\nLike I said, it's gonna give me\na little bit of a hard time,\n\n203\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.320\nit really like its resolution, and\nit doesn't really like to change.\n\n204\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.580\nIt's set in its ways.\n\n205\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.405\n>> Unfortunately we use\na different resolution.\n\n206\n00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:14.570\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, and\nwe're gonna tell it what we want to do.\n\n207\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.940\nCuz right, we're the customers.\n\n208\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.040\n[LAUGH] So the global administrator\nthat we set, that username and\n\n209\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.340\nthat password,\nthat's what we're using here.\n\n210\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.700\nRemember the first one was\njust the administrator and\n\n211\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.590\nthe password to the database itself.\n\n212\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.760\nSo we're gonna type our admin and\n\n213\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.430\nthen our super secret password here and\nwe will launch this up.\n\n214\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.060\nNow there are a couple of\nthings that you can do here.\n\n215\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.640\nThere's a guided configuration\nthat you can walk through and\n\n216\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.480\nyou can choose begin here.\n\n217\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.120\nAnd it'll do exactly what it sounds like.\n\n218\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.760\nIt will take you through some\nof the initial configurations.\n\n219\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.830\nBut I don't want to go that route.\n\n220\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.160\nI want to show you guys.\n\n221\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.930\nI'll guide you through\nthe configuration here.\n\n222\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.130\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and close that down,\nbut I just mention it because it stays\n\n223\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.520\nright here in your dashboard and\nit's great to have guys.\n\n224\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.150\nSo if you're watching this video\nout there, you know, and you want\n\n225\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.900\na little bit of, you know, visualization\nand listening in the background and\n\n226\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.200\nat the same time have something on your\nscreen like it can walk you through this.\n\n227\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.160\nYou'll have both of them here.\n\n228\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.480\nAll right, so\nthe first thing that we're gonna do.\n\n229\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.360\nWhen you download and\n\n230\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.600\ninstall the e-policy server,\nyou don't have any software on it yet.\n\n231\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.010\nI know it's kinda interesting at first,\nbut this this technology\n\n232\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.570\ncan scale up to so many different products\n\n233\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.580\nwithin e-policy that you're going to\nhave to check the software in first.\n\n234\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.030\nSo we're going to go ahead.\n\n235\n00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.890\nAnd one of the first\nones that we want to do.\n\n236\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.010\nWe're going to go to menu here, all right?\n\n237\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.720\nAnd inside of menu,\nyou'll see that we have.\n\n238\n00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.890\nZoom in here and\nshow you a couple different locations.\n\n239\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.450\nWe have systems, reporting, policies,\nI mean imagine that, it's called e-policy\n\n240\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.190\nserver, I imagine they would probably\nhave a policy section there.\n\n241\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.420\nBut the one that I want is the software\nand there's 2 different locations.\n\n242\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.100\nThere's the software manager.\n\n243\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.320\nAnd there's this master repository.\n\n244\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.910\nNow, your master repository's\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n245\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:12.010\nIt's where everything is stored.\n\n246\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.470\nBut if I go into the master repository,\nright now,\n\n247\n00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.840\nI only have some of the basic stuff.\n\n248\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.200\nLike you can see, for the agent for\nWindows If we wanna implement\n\n249\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.740\nany virus scans, they have something known\nas the virus scan enterprise software.\n\n250\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.210\nSo, we could go ahead and just say you\nknow what, let's just install the agent.\n\n251\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.260\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and get\nthe software starting the installation,\n\n252\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.960\nwhile we push the agent out, so\nwe don't have to wait on those.\n\n253\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.340\nNow to do this, we're gonna go to menu,\nwe're gonna go to software,\n\n254\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.500\nand then we're gonna go\nto that software manager.\n\n255\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.570\nAll right, and it takes us to software\nmanager, and on the left-hand side,\n\n256\n00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.170\nthere's a couple locations\nthat we need to look at.\n\n257\n00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:01.490\nAll right, notice that we have checked in\nsoftware, software that's not checked in.\n\n258\n00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:06.530\nYou can see that we only have, you can't\nsee it, cuz I scratched right through it.\n\n259\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.960\nWe only have 1 piece of software that's in\nhere, and I'll show you what that is in\n\n260\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.700\na second, but\nwe have 55 evaluation pieces of software.\n\n261\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.670\nDepending on your license, your site\nlicense is gonna dictate how much\n\n262\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.570\nlicense software is in\nthat first category there.\n\n263\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.140\nAnd since this is an evaluation,\nyou can imagine we don't have any licensed\n\n264\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.470\nsoftware in there yet, that's gonna\ncome when we do pay for our license.\n\n265\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.440\nNow, you might say, well, wait a second,\nwe don't have any licensed software,\n\n266\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.200\nI mean, why are we using a trial?\n\n267\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.910\nWell, it's not that you don't get\nthings like your virus protection.\n\n268\n00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.980\nBut, as you're gonna see in a second\nthere's so much software that this thing\n\n269\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.400\ncan help you to download and maintain,\nit could be a little overwhelming.\n\n270\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.510\nSo, we're gonna go to evaluation first.\n\n271\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.430\nI'll tell you what, I told you I would go\nto the one that was already checked in,\n\n272\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.870\nthat's that agent that we\nseen there in the list.\n\n273\n00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.870\nIt's already installed, it comes\nwith the ePO or the e-policy server,\n\n274\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.200\nyou guys might see it called out there\nif you're ever doing a search for\n\n275\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.580\nit, ePO server, but e-policy server.\n\n276\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.170\nWell, we don't want just the agent, right.\n\n277\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:14.100\nThe purpose of this series is\nto have anti-virus protection.\n\n278\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.150\nAnd that isn't built in my default.\n\n279\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.490\nSo we're gonna go over to\nthe evaluation side here.\n\n280\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.090\nAnd I tell you, when you look at this Dan.\n\n281\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.890\nYou think well,\nthere's only 3 pieces of software.\n\n282\n00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.823\n>> Not a whole lot going on\nin that there list there.\n\n283\n00:15:27.823 --> 00:15:29.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n284\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.270\nBut let me show you the scroll bar here.\n\n285\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.810\nWe gotta a lot software there.\n\n286\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.640\n>> So don't let it confuse you guys,\n[LAUGH] if you're\n\n287\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.070\nright now you're watching this and going\nthrough the process and I want you to say,\n\n288\n00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.960\nwell, Wes wait a second you said\n>> So, there's a lot of software.\n\n289\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.450\nI only see three things here.\n\n290\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.075\nYou'll see that what we want is\nthe enterprise level virus scan, and\n\n291\n00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:55.099\nyou can just see so much stuff here,\nintegrity control, device control,\n\n292\n00:15:55.099 --> 00:15:59.829\nand just way too much to mention,\nand just This segment here, alone.\n\n293\n00:15:59.829 --> 00:16:04.659\nThe one that I really want, and\ndepending on either the systems that\n\n294\n00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:08.982\nyou have to support,\nwhether they're Windows 7 systems,\n\n295\n00:16:08.982 --> 00:16:13.747\nwhether you got Windows 8, 8.1,\nmaybe even going back to XP.\n\n296\n00:16:13.747 --> 00:16:17.533\nI'm sure XP's still out there, obviously\njust because they quit supporting,\n\n297\n00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:19.108\nit's a great operating system.\n\n298\n00:16:19.108 --> 00:16:20.020\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n299\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.815\nSo you might even have\nXP systems out there.\n\n300\n00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.370\nSo, do your research on which\nversion you might need.\n\n301\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.550\nBut, what I'm going to do,\nis I'm going to get the VSE 8.8, or\n\n302\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.670\nthe VirusScan Enterprise, another acronym\nif you're ever doing a search for\n\n303\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.890\nsome of this technology.\n\n304\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.770\nI you type in VSE 8.8,\n\n305\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.460\nit's a good abbreviation to get you a lot\nof documentation on this software here.\n\n306\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.380\nBut notice that it's not installed.\n\n307\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.650\nSo if I select this software,\nI get another list down at the bottom.\n\n308\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.290\nAll right, and we'll kind of go\nthrough this one by one here.\n\n309\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:55.080\nNotice that I have a component, a\ncomponent that's a part of this software.\n\n310\n00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.480\nBut there's more than one component.\n\n311\n00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.020\nNotice that I also have a patch too.\n\n312\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.920\nNow, going over to the other side so\nthat you can see it.\n\n313\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.780\nNow, this other side here is\nwhere we check in software.\n\n314\n00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.450\nAll right, now it doesn't necessarily\nmean that we're going to download it.\n\n315\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.766\nIt just means that we're going to consider\nhaving this available for our server.\n\n316\n00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:19.870\nSo we're going to go ahead, and\nrather than, in fact, this next one,\n\n317\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:25.450\nmy head's covering it up here,\ns the Check In All, right?\n\n318\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:30.390\nIf I know I want to get the VSE,\nthe Virus Scan Enterprise and\n\n319\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.530\nI want everything inside of it,\nwell why, go ahead.\n\n320\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.056\nWhy make it difficult on ourselves and\ncheck in and\n\n321\n00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.989\ndownload everything individually?\n\n322\n00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:41.800\nI don't really want to do that, so I'm\ngoing to go ahead and say check in all.\n\n323\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.240\nAnd here's where it tells me\nto fill out some information.\n\n324\n00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.840\nNow, I'm going to go ahead and\nfill this information out here.\n\n325\n00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.990\nThey require the information to be here.\n\n326\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.070\nNow you might say well, wait a second,\nWes, this is a license or a trial version,\n\n327\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.770\nand they need my\ninformation ahead of time?\n\n328\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.730\nWell, yes, they do, but\n\n329\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.910\ndon't think that this is going to affect\nwhether you can use this software.\n\n330\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.260\nThey just need to have it on hand so that,\n\n331\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:08.340\nlet's say at the end of your 90 days, you\nknow that you want to use this software.\n\n332\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.990\nYou've already implemented it.\n\n333\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.850\nWhy would you want to uninstall it\nfrom everything on your network and\n\n334\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.400\nthen turn around and reinstall it?\n\n335\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.140\nSo this information will be handy,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n336\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.310\nIf you are going to evaluate this and\n\n337\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.010\nthen potentially go into production, don't\njust put arbitrary information in here.\n\n338\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.570\nPut the information that's\nspecific to your company.\n\n339\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.570\n>> I'll actually give McAFEE credit here\n>> They assume that you're going to enjoy\n\n340\n00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.860\ntheir product and like it so\nmuch that you are going to\n\n341\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.730\ngo away from that evaluation and actually\ninstall the full blown system and use it.\n\n342\n00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.010\nSo, it is actually quite interesting so\nfar.\n\n343\n00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.360\nIt's much different from a lot\nof the other systems we've seen\n\n344\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.030\nin the way that it operates.\n\n345\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.930\nObviously, you have to\ndownload their software.\n\n346\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.980\nIt's got a download portion,\n\n347\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.350\ndifferent from where we've seen with like\nSymantec or Kaspersky where they had those\n\n348\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.842\nclient softwares available to the manager\nalready, as kind of part of the package.\n\n349\n00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:05.620\nHere I can pick and choose what I need and\ndownload it as necessary and\n\n350\n00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.390\nmake it available to\nmay management server.\n\n351\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.260\nSo it's a very interesting\nmodel that they have.\n\n352\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:09.880\n>> Yeah it is.\n\n353\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.180\nSo my title,\nI think I'm going to put Major Geek here.\n\n354\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.011\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I said don't put arbitrary information,\n\n355\n00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:14.897\nbut that's not arbitrary.\n\n356\n00:19:14.897 --> 00:19:16.978\nIf you know me,\nI am a pretty major geek here.\n\n357\n00:19:16.978 --> 00:19:20.988\nSo like I said,\njust filling out some information here,\n\n358\n00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:24.257\nnothing really too\nextremely exciting here.\n\n359\n00:19:24.257 --> 00:19:28.448\nLike I said, it doesn't reach out and\ncall home while you are doing this, so\n\n360\n00:19:28.448 --> 00:19:29.900\ndon't worry about that.\n\n361\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.670\nBut there again, you don't want to have to\nuninstall this inside of your corporation\n\n362\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.710\nafter you have implemented it.\n\n363\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.110\nLet's put that what do we put?\n\n364\n00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.570\nWe'll put a Hollywood number there 555.\n\n365\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.680\nOne two, one two.\n\n366\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.650\nThat's right.\n\n367\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.420\nAnd, email address, I'll go ahead and\n\n368\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.000\nfill that out, because everybody's got to\nknow how to fill out an email address and,\n\n369\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.655\nwith my spelling capabilities, I might\nactually have to take lessons on that one.\n\n370\n00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:57.860\n[LAUGH] Everybody knows around here,\nI can't spell without a word processor.\n\n371\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.280\nNow here's where the resolution is\ngoing to come into play for us here.\n\n372\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.840\nYou really can't see the OK button,\nthe Save button, but there it is.\n\n373\n00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.320\nIt looks like it's grayed out, guys, but\nthat's just due to the resolution here.\n\n374\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.320\nIt really wants you to\nhave that resolution.\n\n375\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.340\nAnd I've got to fill out\nthe number of employees.\n\n376\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.140\nLet me go ahead and show you that too,\nso you can get an idea when they say,\n\n377\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.570\nhow many employees\nare you going to support?\n\n378\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.410\nLook at that number, Dan.\n\n379\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.680\nTen thousand.\n\n380\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.678\nTen thousand.\n\n381\n00:20:28.678 --> 00:20:31.740\nThat is, oops,\nyeah you can't see it now there.\n\n382\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.364\nMake that, try to make that\na little bit easier to see.\n\n383\n00:20:36.964 --> 00:20:40.110\nWe've got ten thousand and beyond.\n\n384\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:46.015\nSo when they say scalability,\nthis is a massive piece of soft, or\n\n385\n00:20:46.015 --> 00:20:51.820\nit's potential is really massive\nhere on a very, very large scale.\n\n386\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.450\nAll right.\n\n387\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.540\nCompany, industry,\nwe're going to say other.\n\n388\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.720\nAnd it didn't like that.\n\n389\n00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.480\nI guess I didn't pick a,\nlet's try that again.\n\n390\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.485\n>> Other is not a company industry.\n\n391\n00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:02.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> Other is not a company industry?\n\n392\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.560\nAll right.\n\n393\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.740\nLet's go ahead and\nsee if we can bring this back up.\n\n394\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.830\nNow, when you check in the software,\n\n395\n00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.630\nyou've got a couple of different branches\nand repositories that you can use.\n\n396\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.235\nYou can use the current, and that's where\nthe majority of the current software that\n\n397\n00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:20.030\nyou're going to deploy is going to stay,\nbut let's say that I'm going to upgrade.\n\n398\n00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.170\nNotice there was an 8.7 in there and\nan 8.8.\n\n399\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.790\nWell let's say we've got 8.7.\n\n400\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.090\nAll right?\n\n401\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:32.048\nWell, I might store 8.7 in a previous\nrepository so that I can test 8.8.\n\n402\n00:21:32.048 --> 00:21:32.766\nRight?\n\n403\n00:21:32.766 --> 00:21:36.100\nSo depending on where you want to store\nthese, and then you've got evaluation, and\n\n404\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.850\nmaybe that's for the purposes\nof what we're doing right here.\n\n405\n00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.020\nMaybe you've already got 8.7 and\nyou say you know what?\n\n406\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.260\nI'm just evaluating 8.8.\n\n407\n00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.280\nWell I can put it in\nthe evaluation repository, and\n\n408\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.610\nit doesn't effect anything that I\ngot in the current master repository\n\n409\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.070\nwhere we're currently\nstoring our information.\n\n410\n00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.170\nSo we'll go ahead and we're going to\naccept the end user licence agreement.\n\n411\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.390\nI know, kind of difficult to see there.\n\n412\n00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.209\nAll right, and you can see that\nthis is the install Windows.\n\n413\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.530\nAnd then we choose OK.\n\n414\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.660\nAnd now it goes through the process,\nand it's updating that information.\n\n415\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.910\nYou can see that it's gone ahead and\nit's got the installer for Windows here.\n\n416\n00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.850\nIt's got the management extension and\nthen the patch that's in there.\n\n417\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.480\nYou have to have the management extension.\n\n418\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.180\nIf you don't have the management\nextension, well imagine this,\n\n419\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.520\nyou're not going to be able to\nmanage the end points here.\n\n420\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.190\nSo you have to have that in place.\n\n421\n00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.190\nNow, there's a couple of other\nthings that you need to do.\n\n422\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.310\nAnd we can do it while it's\ninstalling the information here.\n\n423\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.930\nThe next thing is creating your groups.\n\n424\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:43.280\nBy default, you have one global\ntype of a group, all right?\n\n425\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.040\nAnd that global group is\nover here at System Tree.\n\n426\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.710\nAll right, now, if you'll see here,\nover on the System Tree, I have one group.\n\n427\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.810\nAnd I have to say, Dan, in some of\nthe other software that we've looked at,\n\n428\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:03.370\nthis really follows almost\nlike that LDAP Hierarchy.\n\n429\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.760\nThis is my organization, and\n\n430\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.660\nI can create subgroups here when\nit goes to deploying systems.\n\n431\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.570\nAll right, so I'll tell you what,\nwe're going to go ahead, and\n\n432\n00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.060\nwhat we're going to do,\nlet's create a couple of groups.\n\n433\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.870\nNow, again, this gets a little\nbit difficult right now to see,\n\n434\n00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.480\nbut let me see if I can make it a little\nbit easier out there for you guys.\n\n435\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.900\nNotice that we have new systems down here.\n\n436\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.290\nWe also have new subgroups.\n\n437\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.150\nIt's the new subgroup\nthat we want to create.\n\n438\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.430\nNow, if I go ahead and say, \"You know\nwhat, I'm going to install a new system\n\n439\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.620\nhere,\" well, it's going to go\non my organization, right?\n\n440\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.320\nThat's the default.\n\n441\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.776\nRemember, because this scales so\nup large, do your homework.\n\n442\n00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:43.551\nDo your research, right?\n\n443\n00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:47.475\nMake your groups according to\nwhatever your topology is,\n\n444\n00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:52.922\nwhatever your The roles within your\ncompany that the computers are performing,\n\n445\n00:23:52.922 --> 00:23:56.466\nif you've got workstations,\ndo you have servers.\n\n446\n00:23:56.466 --> 00:24:00.140\nSo you might wanna break these up, again,\nbased on whatever role they're performing.\n\n447\n00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.130\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a new subgroup here.\n\n448\n00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.370\n>> That really makes good sense,\nactually, there, Wes,\n\n449\n00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.170\nbecause what sense does it make to\ncreate a bunch of different groups\n\n450\n00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:13.160\nthat are basically, the roles and features\nare the roles in your business and\n\n451\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.640\nthey don't match up with\ngroups you already have.\n\n452\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.137\nMake it easy on yourself, if you have\na sales group, create a sales group,\n\n453\n00:24:19.137 --> 00:24:21.924\nthat way you know all the sales\ncomputers are in that group.\n\n454\n00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:26.882\nIt makes it easy for you, and\nit gives you consistency across the board.\n\n455\n00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:28.460\nNo one's gonna get confused.\n\n456\n00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.580\nA lot of times you're not just\nthe only guy working on this stuff.\n\n457\n00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.560\nSo if I make a group that makes no sense\nto Wes, what's he supposed to do with it?\n\n458\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.230\nIs he gonna come over and go,\nwell, I thought it meant this and\n\n459\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.400\nthat's why I applied this policy,\nand I'm like, no, no,\n\n460\n00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.012\nno you've totally messed up everything,\ncuz we didn't have consistency.\n\n461\n00:24:44.012 --> 00:24:46.825\nSo try to keep that consistent,\nit is a good idea.\n\n462\n00:24:46.825 --> 00:24:49.310\n>> Well, that's right, and if you\nthink of some of the other concepts,\n\n463\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.645\nsecurity-related, that we talk about,\n\n464\n00:24:50.645 --> 00:24:54.035\nwe talk about role-based access control,\nrole-based administration, right?\n\n465\n00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:56.165\nYou have administrators and\nyou have standard users, right?\n\n466\n00:24:56.165 --> 00:24:57.795\nSo the concept follows along, and\n\n467\n00:24:57.795 --> 00:25:02.685\nwhat you're doing is you're implementing\na lot of the same stuff that we see.\n\n468\n00:25:02.685 --> 00:25:04.461\nMaybe we don't think about it that way,\nbut\n\n469\n00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.670\nthat's role-based administration, right?\n\n470\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.990\nYou know you have predetermined roles,\nadministrators, domain administrators,\n\n471\n00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.440\nenterprise administrators,\nsalespeople, your security staff.\n\n472\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.065\nSo go ahead and just follow that and\nlike Dan said, it keeps it consistent.\n\n473\n00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:24.045\nNow, once we've got that done,\nit's time to add a new system.\n\n474\n00:25:24.045 --> 00:25:25.415\nAnd that's what we need to do.\n\n475\n00:25:25.415 --> 00:25:27.245\nSo when you add a new system,\n\n476\n00:25:27.245 --> 00:25:32.442\nthis is where the point where you\ncan start to deploy to the agents.\n\n477\n00:25:32.442 --> 00:25:34.960\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's do that.\n\n478\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.160\nTime to go ahead and\ndeploy to some agents.\n\n479\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.370\nRemember what we're gonna do is we have\nto use the new system option here.\n\n480\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.650\nRemember we created the subgroup,\n\n481\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.080\nnow we have the new systems that\nwe're gonna go ahead and implement.\n\n482\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.830\nSo let's do that.\n\n483\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.390\nNow, it will give you the option\non how you want to deploy this and\n\n484\n00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:58.330\nwhere do you want to put the endpoint\nonce the agent has been deployed.\n\n485\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.985\nNow agents, guys,\nkeep in mind every one of these pieces\n\n486\n00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:05.115\nof enterprise software call\nit something different.\n\n487\n00:26:05.115 --> 00:26:07.715\nSometimes they call it client,\nsometimes they call it agent.\n\n488\n00:26:07.715 --> 00:26:11.995\nThis is the software that's running on\nthe endpoint that's gonna communicate with\n\n489\n00:26:11.995 --> 00:26:13.553\nthe e-policy server here.\n\n490\n00:26:13.553 --> 00:26:17.065\nAnd notice it says you can push the agent\nand then add them to the current group\n\n491\n00:26:17.065 --> 00:26:20.735\nthat you're in, more specifically,\nthe one that I just created.\n\n492\n00:26:20.735 --> 00:26:21.875\nAnd that's what we want.\n\n493\n00:26:21.875 --> 00:26:24.985\nAnd then from here,\nyou're gonna put the name of the computer.\n\n494\n00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.440\nAnd so, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n495\n00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.940\nI'll put the name of the computer, and you\ncould use a CSV file, so if you needed to\n\n496\n00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.380\ndeploy this out to a lot of computers,\nyou can do it a little bit easier here.\n\n497\n00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.330\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n498\n00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.680\nNow it's not just Windows specific, right?\n\n499\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.450\nIt also has Linux here,\n\n500\n00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.520\nso if you're supporting Linux systems,\nit also have the Linux agent too.\n\n501\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.218\nAnd then you're gonna put the domain,\nusername and password.\n\n502\n00:26:55.218 --> 00:26:57.020\nNow if you're in a domain environment,\n\n503\n00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.040\nyou can save yourself a little bit of time\nand, again, it might pose a little bit of\n\n504\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.800\na security risk any time you use\nany kind of remember me option.\n\n505\n00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.280\nDoesn't matter if it's on a website or\nif it's on a server.\n\n506\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.930\nRemember, if somebody exploits the server,\n\n507\n00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.140\nthey now have administrative\nrights to your computer.\n\n508\n00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.730\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll use administrator.\n\n509\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.800\nAnd we use our super secret password here,\nand\n\n510\n00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.420\nthen it gives me options of where\ndo I want this to be installed.\n\n511\n00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.760\nI tell you, Dan,\nI'm just gonna leave the defaults here.\n\n512\n00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.040\nProgram, files, continuous attempts here.\n\n513\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.520\nHow often do you want it to try?\n\n514\n00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.820\nYou could see here a 0,\nwe just want it to keep trying.\n\n515\n00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.330\nI want this installed.\n\n516\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.340\nAnd I can choose which agent handler,\nlike I could say if, again,\n\n517\n00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.580\nif you've got a distributed environment,\n\n518\n00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.500\nyou might have a specific repository\nwhere you'll want this to come from.\n\n519\n00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.810\nSince we're just doing\ndemonstrations here,\n\n520\n00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:54.640\nI'm just gonna leave it to the default and\nthen we just choose OK.\n\n521\n00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.770\nAnd it's gonna bring up\nthis interface here, and\n\n522\n00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.250\nnow what were gonna do is were\ngonna switch over to our client.\n\n523\n00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.519\nNow, it takes a little bit for\nit to happen, all right.\n\n524\n00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:08.617\nJust like [LAUGH] any of these pieces\nof software here when you click it,\n\n525\n00:28:08.617 --> 00:28:13.409\nif you click on the machine itself it's\ngonna give me a little bit of information,\n\n526\n00:28:13.409 --> 00:28:13.910\nright?\n\n527\n00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.310\nIt's gonna give me the name that I used,\n\n528\n00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.590\nbut it doesn't really tell\nme anything other than that.\n\n529\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.500\nWhy is that?\n\n530\n00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.700\nWell, it's because the agent\nisn't currently installed.\n\n531\n00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.730\nYou could see here in the notification\narea up here in our file structure that,\n\n532\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.490\nwhoop, there it is,\nit just showed up there and\n\n533\n00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.120\nthere's that McAfee Common Framework.\n\n534\n00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.925\nAnd we could see that a lot of\nthe same information that was\n\n535\n00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:44.140\nin the photo that I extracted\nis also in here now.\n\n536\n00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.640\nAnd I should be able here, in a second,\nto update this information or\n\n537\n00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.780\njust kind of refresh\nthe page if I want to.\n\n538\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.770\nIf I go back,\nit changed the name on me too, and\n\n539\n00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.800\nnotice it's now the compliance summary.\n\n540\n00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.810\nWhat is the compliance summary but\nthe fact that the agent's been installed.\n\n541\n00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.180\nAll right, so\ndoes that mean we're protected?\n\n542\n00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.290\nWe're ready to go?\n\n543\n00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.830\nWell, no, [LAUGH] that's\nonly one side of the tracks.\n\n544\n00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.350\nRight?\n\n545\n00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.799\nThat's the agent itself.\n\n546\n00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:14.007\nRemember, we downloaded\nthe VirusScan Enterprise software.\n\n547\n00:29:14.007 --> 00:29:16.620\nWell, that's the next thing\nthat we have to deploy out.\n\n548\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.070\nWe actually have to\ndeploy the stat software.\n\n549\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.140\nNow there's a few different\nways that you can do this.\n\n550\n00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.330\nIf you're looking at\njust a specific computer,\n\n551\n00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.580\nI can go down here to Actions,\nand then I can to Agent.\n\n552\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.720\nAnd then from here,\nI can go to Deploy Agents.\n\n553\n00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.200\nBut you can also do this\nfrom the main page as well.\n\n554\n00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.680\nYour System Tree is what\nI've selected here.\n\n555\n00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:43.260\nYou could see the group, and if you had\nmultiple computers in here, like I said,\n\n556\n00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.670\nit really likes its resolution here.\n\n557\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.490\nYou can see that I can\nalso do this down here.\n\n558\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.850\nSame thing, little bit different.\n\n559\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.880\nIt adds couple of things\nlike Directory Management.\n\n560\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.180\nRemember, it really does follow like that\nLDAP structure, but we'll go ahead and\n\n561\n00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:03.200\nwe'll use this one cuz it makes it\na little bit easier to see there.\n\n562\n00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.980\nWe've already deployed the agents, right?\n\n563\n00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.070\nSo, we don't need to do that,\nthank goodness.\n\n564\n00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.480\nThe other thing that we have\nis Run Client Task Now.\n\n565\n00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.890\nThat's the one that we're gonna look at.\n\n566\n00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.710\nAll right, now when we run the task,\nnotice that we've got a couple of options.\n\n567\n00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.570\nNotice I've already got the virus,\n[LAUGH] this is gonna get a little tricky,\n\n568\n00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.940\nright, I've got the VirusScan\nenterprise software here, right.\n\n569\n00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.390\nYou might think, well,\nthat's what we're going to choose,\n\n570\n00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.380\nright, to deploy the product.\n\n571\n00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.830\nNo.\nAll right.\n\n572\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.665\n>> Why did we do that?\n\n573\n00:30:29.665 --> 00:30:30.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, yeah, why,\n\n574\n00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.510\nthat would make too much sense, right?\n\n575\n00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.080\nWell, it's the agents, right?\n\n576\n00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.810\nThe agent is the one that's installed,\n\n577\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.980\nso it's going to manage the transfer\nof the VirusScan software.\n\n578\n00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.320\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nchoose, and we kinda zoom in on that so\n\n579\n00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.220\nyou guys could see that a little better,\nwe're gonna do the agent here, and\n\n580\n00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.490\nProduct Deployment.\n\n581\n00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.780\nThat's what we want.\n\n582\n00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.690\nSo we'll do Product Deployment,\nand look how many tasks, Dan,\n\n583\n00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.106\nwe have to go along with it.\n\n584\n00:30:57.106 --> 00:30:59.924\n[CROSSTALK] I mean, so easy.\n\n585\n00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:04.279\n[LAUGH] Well, what we have to do here is,\nwe're gonna Create a Task, and when you\n\n586\n00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:09.600\ncreate the task, now you're gonna tell it,\nwell, what is it that you want to deploy?\n\n587\n00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.050\nAll right, target platforms.\n\n588\n00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.200\nIt's not limited.\n\n589\n00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.930\nRight?\nThere's\n\n590\n00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.450\na lot of different operating\nsystems that this supports.\n\n591\n00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.910\nWe've got Windows in here.\n\n592\n00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.952\nSun, I guess it's not Sun Solaris anymore,\nit is Sun Solaris.\n\n593\n00:31:21.952 --> 00:31:22.850\nIs it Sun Solaris?\n\n594\n00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:23.570\n>> Yeah.\n\n595\n00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.140\n>> Linux and Mac here, too.\n\n596\n00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.480\nBut since, you guys have seen,\n\n597\n00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.260\nwe're in a Windows environment,\nwe're gonna select a software, right?\n\n598\n00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.400\nSo if we did have Linux machines or\nMac machines,\n\n599\n00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.170\nmaybe we wan to deploy those agents,\nwe can make a task to do that too.\n\n600\n00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.517\nThe good thing is the agent\ndeployment has pre-built in tasks, so\n\n601\n00:31:39.517 --> 00:31:41.741\nyou don't have to reinvent the wheel here.\n\n602\n00:31:41.741 --> 00:31:44.953\nBut with the VirusScan,\nwe actually want to select.\n\n603\n00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:45.974\nThat.\n\n604\n00:31:45.974 --> 00:31:49.015\nSo we'll go ahead and do that,\nwe'll select virus scan.\n\n605\n00:31:49.015 --> 00:31:50.140\nAnd what do we wanna do?\n\n606\n00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.410\nWhat's really, really cool,\nand it's kinda interesting,\n\n607\n00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:58.540\nwe were talking about this just a few\nmoments ago before we went live here,\n\n608\n00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.540\nand it also gives you the ability\nto remove an agent if you need to.\n\n609\n00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.113\nSometimes the software that you\nuse when it gets its hands or\n\n610\n00:32:06.113 --> 00:32:10.000\nits fingers into the computer, it's very,\nvery difficult to get the agents out.\n\n611\n00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.020\nAnd this is a nice feature here where\nit allows you to remove the agent\n\n612\n00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.620\nif that's what you're doing.\n\n613\n00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.640\nMaybe you're gonna get rid of a computer\nbecause you're deploying new computers, so\n\n614\n00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.060\nyou can also do that.\n\n615\n00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.120\nLanguage and where the branch is,\nand we've kept it in current, so\n\n616\n00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.100\nwe'll do Install.\n\n617\n00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:30.980\nAnd if I want to allow the end\nusers to postpone the deployment,\n\n618\n00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.130\nI can give them that ability,\nbut we all know, right,\n\n619\n00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.440\nwhy end users don't like administrators,\nit's right in the name, right?\n\n620\n00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.950\nAdmin is traitor.\n\n621\n00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:42.100\nWe're not gonna allow\nthem to defer anything-\n\n622\n00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.267\n>> We will rule IT with an iron fist.\n\n623\n00:32:44.267 --> 00:32:45.209\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right,\n\n624\n00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:47.230\n[LAUGH] that's exactly right.\n\n625\n00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:51.490\nSo notice the status here, right,\nand I know you guys can't see that,\n\n626\n00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.240\nlet me make that a little easier there,\nget all of that in the location.\n\n627\n00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.730\nNotice that at first it was gray,\ngray means it's trying to communicate and\n\n628\n00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.150\nit doesn't know if it has.\n\n629\n00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.820\nThe moment that first bar turns green\nit doesn't mean that it's completed,\n\n630\n00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.980\nit just means that the agent has\nmade communications with the server.\n\n631\n00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.960\nNow, how can I verify that?\n\n632\n00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.910\nWell, I could go over here,\nand gotta activate Windows.\n\n633\n00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.830\nAnd if I look at the agent status, notice\nI'm just doing agent status monitor.\n\n634\n00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.040\nAnd there it goes,\nit shows up on our screen for us, and\n\n635\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.604\nit's letting me know that it's downloading\nall of this information, right?\n\n636\n00:33:29.604 --> 00:33:34.360\nAnd real quick note, the agent by default,\n\n637\n00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.650\nevery 60 minutes contacts the ePolicy\nserver, the ePO server, and\n\n638\n00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.770\nsays, anything new that\nI need to know about?\n\n639\n00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.550\nIs there a new task that's been scheduled?\n\n640\n00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.748\nAnd you can see what it did\nhere is it did connect, right?\n\n641\n00:33:45.748 --> 00:33:49.570\nAnd it said, we're gonna download\nthe Windows installer, right, and\n\n642\n00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.940\nwe're gonna verify the installation.\n\n643\n00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.371\nNotice it's sending an event package\nback to the ePO server, right,\n\n644\n00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:58.179\nwell what's that event that it's\nsending back to the ePO server?\n\n645\n00:33:58.179 --> 00:34:00.732\nNotice my status bar is changing, right?\n\n646\n00:34:00.732 --> 00:34:04.577\nThe status bar is changing, not only\nhas the agent made a communication, but\n\n647\n00:34:04.577 --> 00:34:08.304\nit's in the process of pulling that\ninformation off of the ePO server, and\n\n648\n00:34:08.304 --> 00:34:10.199\ninstalling the antivirus software so\n\n649\n00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:13.607\nthat we can begin to monitor this\npiece of software, this machine.\n\n650\n00:34:13.607 --> 00:34:18.506\nAnd then if we need to initiate scans, if\nit has a virus, it can start to report, we\n\n651\n00:34:18.506 --> 00:34:23.340\ncan get the benefits of the agent or the\nvirus scan being installed on that agent.\n\n652\n00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.630\nSo, Dan, when it comes down to it,\nit's not too really difficult,\n\n653\n00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.840\nI know when you first see the interface,\nit is complex, don't get me wrong.\n\n654\n00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.950\nAnd it can scale out to a lot of stuff,\nbut if you're looking for\n\n655\n00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.742\nthe basic, basic functionality,\nyou'll wanna protect your endpoints.\n\n656\n00:34:38.742 --> 00:34:41.327\nYou wanna get them that\nenterprise software,\n\n657\n00:34:41.327 --> 00:34:44.983\nthe anti-malware software deployed\nquickly, you can do that.\n\n658\n00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:49.470\nAnd notice I don't have a license,\nit's all evaluation.\n\n659\n00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.030\nSo you could still evaluate this,\n\n660\n00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:55.640\nyou could still determine, does it protect\nyour computers without having a license?\n\n661\n00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:59.130\nAnd you could see that it's going\nthrough the process of installing.\n\n662\n00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.770\nOne more final check\nthat I might see here.\n\n663\n00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:07.525\nLet's see if we can zoom in on that,\nthere we go.\n\n664\n00:35:07.525 --> 00:35:12.380\nOop, there we go,\nit says Check antivirus status.\n\n665\n00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.280\nAny time you download a new\npiece of antivirus software,\n\n666\n00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.710\nthere's no telling how\nold its definitions are.\n\n667\n00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.170\nSo if I was to go into Action Center\nright now, and there it is.\n\n668\n00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:24.970\nLook, it's already showed up, and\n\n669\n00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:29.070\nit's telling me that I've got my\nvirus scan console ready to go.\n\n670\n00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:33.275\nBut I would almost be willing to bet,\njust like all other pieces of\n\n671\n00:35:33.275 --> 00:35:37.705\nanti-malware software, that if I go to\nthe Action Center it's gonna tell me,\n\n672\n00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:41.625\nyou really need to update,\nand it is telling me that.\n\n673\n00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:44.915\nLook, it said VirusScan Enterprise\nanti-malware software reports that it is\n\n674\n00:35:44.915 --> 00:35:46.625\nout of date and it needs to be updated.\n\n675\n00:35:46.625 --> 00:35:48.375\nBut thank goodness our agent's installed,\n\n676\n00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:51.855\nthe software's installed, now all we\nhave to do is schedule an update through\n\n677\n00:35:51.855 --> 00:35:56.185\nthe server to make sure that this\nendpoint is up to date and protected.\n\n678\n00:35:56.185 --> 00:35:59.405\n>> Yeah, and definitely an interesting\ninterface philosophy that\n\n679\n00:35:59.405 --> 00:36:00.410\nthey've got going on here.\n\n680\n00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.636\nVery different from the other\nstuff that we've seen so far, but\n\n681\n00:36:03.636 --> 00:36:05.857\nit has its own place,\nit does its own thing.\n\n682\n00:36:05.857 --> 00:36:10.030\nIt's very, very awesome, so if you like\nthis, this might be the way you wanna go.\n\n683\n00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.790\nDefinitely got some interesting\ncontrols going on there.\n\n684\n00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:14.270\nWes, this has been a lot of fun.\n\n685\n00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.530\nIs there anything, parting words,\n\n686\n00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.762\nwe need to let our viewers\nknow about ePolicy server?\n\n687\n00:36:18.762 --> 00:36:23.802\n>> No, and coming up in the next episode,\nwe are gonna show you how to update this,\n\n688\n00:36:23.802 --> 00:36:28.918\nso when I say this, stick around for\npart two, because we're going to show you,\n\n689\n00:36:28.918 --> 00:36:32.106\nmake sure that the software's updated,\nright?\n\n690\n00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:34.961\nIt doesn't make sense to\ninstall antivirus software and\n\n691\n00:36:34.961 --> 00:36:37.220\nhave an out of date definition database.\n\n692\n00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.730\n>> That's right, well thank you so much\nfor showing us how to get started with\n\n693\n00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.170\nthe ePolicy server, it's a very\ninteresting piece of software there.\n\n694\n00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:48.107\nThank you guys for joining us today, we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n695\n00:36:48.107 --> 00:36:49.941\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n696\n00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:50.900\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n697\n00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.441\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.337\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we're gonna continue\n\n4\n00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:22.290\ntaking a look at antivirus and\nanti-malware solutions.\n\n5\n00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.570\nJoining me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.880\nWes, welcome to the studio.\n\n7\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.780\nHow are you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.360\n>> I'm doing great, and thanks as\nalways Dan for having me back here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.170\nAnd that's right,\n\n10\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.530\nwe're gonna be moving into part two\nof our McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator.\n\n11\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.100\nAnd what we're gonna be showing you today,\nin the previous episode,\n\n12\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.320\nlet's talk about that first, right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.770\nWe showed you how to setup the server,\nhow to push out the agent, if you will,\n\n14\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.520\nto the endpoint, and\nthen pretty much just get that installed.\n\n15\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.240\nBut now it's gonna be time to show you\nhow you can monitor your work station\n\n16\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.410\nas well as remediate\nthe work stations too.\n\n17\n00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.950\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n18\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.850\nI've got the ePolicy Orchestrator\ninterface up right now.\n\n19\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210\nAnd one of the things you can see,\nthis is one of the dashboards.\n\n20\n00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.100\nAnd you can customize\nthese if you want to, and\n\n21\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.080\nit's got a few of these\nbuilt in dashboards.\n\n22\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.830\nThe one that I'm looking at\nright now is thread events.\n\n23\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.000\nNow, when you wanna see information\nabout a specific machine,\n\n24\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.650\nyou can go to the system tree and find any\none of those machines that might be in\n\n25\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.350\nthe list if you've already\ndeployed the agent.\n\n26\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.660\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna go there,\n\n27\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.420\nwe're gonna go to the system tree here.\n\n28\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.598\nAnd you'll see our machine in the list.\n\n29\n00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:32.210\nThen we're gonna go ahead and select the\nmachine and it it brings up the properties\n\n30\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.020\nof the workstation that is in question or\nyou might be monitoring.\n\n31\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.980\nObviously you could have hundreds if\nnot thousands of these in the list so,\n\n32\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.580\nyou could also use filters too.\n\n33\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.610\nIt's a little bit easier when\nyou only have one machine,\n\n34\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.490\nyou only have one place to look here.\n\n35\n00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.180\nNow when we want to, let's say,\ncommunicate with the end point,\n\n36\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.080\nwhen we want to push out a scan.\n\n37\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.170\nWe want to make sure that machine is\ngonna have some kind of file scan go on.\n\n38\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.310\nThe first thing that we have to do is test\nthe communications between our server and\n\n39\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.242\nbetween the end point.\n\n40\n00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:06.610\nWe wanna know that the agent\nthere can communicate.\n\n41\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.710\nAnd this is fairly easy to do.\n\n42\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.790\nThey even got a button down here\nthat says Wake Up Agents, and\n\n43\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.900\nyou could push this out and\nwe'll go ahead and do that.\n\n44\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.540\nWe'll go ahead and choose Wake Up Agent\nand it asks us, what do you want to do?\n\n45\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.170\nDo you want to do an agent wake up call,\nsuper wake up call,\n\n46\n00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.460\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\nleave it at the defaults there.\n\n47\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.320\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nsend that on its way.\n\n48\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920\nNow, when the agent comes online,\n\n49\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.190\nthe next thing we need to do is\ntest the reachability, right.\n\n50\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.350\nWe need to verify, can we communicate with\nthis device, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.660\nchoose the ping option.\n\n52\n00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.810\nAnd this is normal,\n\n53\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.510\nany normal ping, and let me see if I\ncan get that there before it goes away.\n\n54\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.478\nAnd it just says,\nsending your ping request.\n\n55\n00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:49.550\nAnd if your machine is online and\nyou can communicate with it,\n\n56\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.690\nit should tell you and it does right\nthere it says this device, and\n\n57\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.700\nit's kind of abbreviated there, this\ndevice is reachable is what that says.\n\n58\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.070\nAnd then we can turn around and\nwe can close that, clear that.\n\n59\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.290\n>> This is the same ping protocol that\nif we opened up a command prompt and\n\n60\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.820\ntyped in ping then the computer name,\nsame idea.\n\n61\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.813\n>> Right, that's exactly it, the ICMP\nprotocol its piggybacking off of there and\n\n62\n00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.410\nit's making sure that we can communicate.\n\n63\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.705\nBecause, we really can't\ninitiate a scan of any kind well,\n\n64\n00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:15.600\nif we can't communicate with the device.\n\n65\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.570\nAt that point you'd have to be at\nthe device to initiate the scan.\n\n66\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.530\nAnd like we've been saying as we've been\nmoving through this series, if you're\n\n67\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.650\nat the device itself, well at that point,\nwhy don't you have consumer grade, right.\n\n68\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.115\nIt's centralized management and\nthat's one of the benefits here.\n\n69\n00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:32.407\nNow the next thing I might wanna do is\nI might wanna initiate a scan, right.\n\n70\n00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:36.065\nI've verified that I do have\nthe reachability out to the work station,\n\n71\n00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.840\nnow when you do this, all these\nbuttons at the bottom are pretty much\n\n72\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.950\nwhere the action's at,\nwhere it's happening.\n\n73\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.120\nSo if I go down to Actions and\nthen I select Agent here,\n\n74\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.510\nyou'll see Agent and\nthen we've got this Run Client Task Now,\n\n75\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.560\nthis gives me the ability to do,\nas you'll see, a few things.\n\n76\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.600\nFor our purposes and demonstrations\nright here, it allows me to send out and\n\n77\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.160\nrequest or initiate,\nI don't even have to request it, right.\n\n78\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.430\nWe're the administrators,\nwe tell them what to do.\n\n79\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.680\nAnd I could push out a client scan, here.\n\n80\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.169\n>> You don't ask pretty please?\n\n81\n00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:07.780\n>> No, I don't.\n\n82\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.089\nIt's our server, and\nthey're gonna do what we say, though.\n\n83\n00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.880\n[LAUGH] So,\na couple of things that you can do.\n\n84\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.870\nYou might have seen,\n\n85\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.600\nin the first episode where we used this\nsame location to push out the agent.\n\n86\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.190\nWe said the agent right here,\nand then product update or\n\n87\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.290\ndeployment, that's not\nwhat I want this time.\n\n88\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.180\nNow that we've got the virus,\nthe VSE, or VirusScan Enterprise,\n\n89\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.770\ninstalled, we've got\na couple of options here.\n\n90\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.450\nYou can see that this is,\nlet me get in here so\n\n91\n00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.010\nyou guys can see that a little bit better.\n\n92\n00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.120\nSo we have the product that's\nin question here, in this case,\n\n93\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.550\nit's gonna be VSE,\nthe VirusScan Enterprise.\n\n94\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.180\nAnd then the task type, and\n\n95\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.910\nwhat I wanna do is I want to\ninitiate an on-demand scan.\n\n96\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.520\nNow, you can see that it is selected and\nDan,\n\n97\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.530\njust like we did in the first episode,\nboy there are a lot of tasks here.\n\n98\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.210\nWe could really get some stuff done.\n\n99\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.310\n>> White text on a white background?\n\n100\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.430\n>> That's right, yeah.\n\n101\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.280\nBlends right in.\n\n102\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.520\nThey wrote it with invisible ink,\nthat's what it was.\n\n103\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.790\nSo, we've got a Create Task\noption here and\n\n104\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.360\nthat's what we're going to\nuse to push out this scan.\n\n105\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.450\nNow, you've got a couple of\noptions when you create that.\n\n106\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.460\nLet me show you guys the different\ntabs that we have across the top.\n\n107\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.340\nScan locations,\nwhat items do you want to be scanned?\n\n108\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.080\nExclusions you can see what\nactions will it perform.\n\n109\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.020\nPerformance, we'll look\nat all this individually.\n\n110\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.740\nWe got Reports and Tasks.\n\n111\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.250\nNow while we're on this page, or\n\n112\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.120\nthis tab, notice that it says\nwhat locations do you wanna scan.\n\n113\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.870\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm actually\ngonna remove one because we've got\n\n114\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.160\none right here that you really should\nbe doing, guys, All local drives.\n\n115\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.510\nWe don't want it to take forever,\nwe want you to be able to see the scan and\n\n116\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.750\nsee it succeed rather than waiting an hour\nand a half for the scan to process.\n\n117\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.110\nAnd that's one of the things\nyou'll also have to keep in mind.\n\n118\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.240\nIf you are doing a scan,\nyou're scanning all of the drives,\n\n119\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.330\nkeep in mind that somebody\nsitting at that computer,\n\n120\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.090\nit's fairly CPU intensive\nany time you run a scan.\n\n121\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.000\nThere's a lot of computation\nthat has to go on there.\n\n122\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.830\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nremove all local drives, but\n\n123\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.042\nI don't wanna leave it at that.\n\n124\n00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:06.580\nI wanna show you some of\nthe options you have,\n\n125\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.240\ncuz you really have a lot of options.\n\n126\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.350\nIt doesn't look like it,\nit looks like four options here but\n\n127\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.990\nwhen we hit this plus symbol, you'll\nsee that there is a drop-down menu and\n\n128\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.820\nit says hey, select an item to scan.\n\n129\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.220\nWell, how many items do we have to scan?\n\n130\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.500\nWell, we've got quite a few here.\n\n131\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.584\nWe can see things like memory for\nrootkits,\n\n132\n00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:27.200\ncommon things too, like your home\nfolder and your user profile.\n\n133\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.980\nA lot of viruses like to get\nright there in that user profile.\n\n134\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.590\nIn fact, maybe if you've launched some\nof the other episodes in the series,\n\n135\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.640\nit really likes to attack that app data\nfolder, where temporary files are.\n\n136\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.505\nSo, maybe you just want I just wanted to\ninitiate a scan right away to do that.\n\n137\n00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.215\nWhat I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna go\nahead and just leave it where it's at.\n\n138\n00:06:45.215 --> 00:06:48.685\nAgain, for the purposes of demonstration\nso you guys don't have to wait forever.\n\n139\n00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:52.365\nNow once that's done,\ndown here in the lower right hand corner,\n\n140\n00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:54.215\nall we have to do is send the scan.\n\n141\n00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:57.475\nI want you to keep in mind,\nnotice the status button here,\n\n142\n00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.185\nor the status bar here.\n\n143\n00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.910\nNotice that it's gray,\n\n144\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.180\ngray doesn't mean that the client has\nactually processed the command yet.\n\n145\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.800\nIt means that it's in the process\nof actually sending it.\n\n146\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.170\nAnd now you can see\nthat it's turned green.\n\n147\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.100\nNotice that when it turns green,\nit tells me that the client\n\n148\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.370\nhas received the command,\ndoesn't mean that it's completed, but\n\n149\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.750\nwe can at least verify the first stages\nof the operation have been initiated.\n\n150\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.630\n>> So communication is occurring at\nthis point, once we see that turn green?\n\n151\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.640\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n152\n00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.500\nSo as an administrator, like Dan says,\nwe can sit back and say okay,\n\n153\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.340\nnow we just have to wait for\nit to basically complete.\n\n154\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.780\nBut let's see what the agent on\nthe client's looks like here for us.\n\n155\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.040\nYou can see if I open\nthis up right here and\n\n156\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.870\nwe zoom in,\nyou can see that it did invoke the task.\n\n157\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.430\nIt invoked the OnDemand Scan that we want.\n\n158\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.700\nSo we know that it's happening here at\nleast from the endpoint's perspective.\n\n159\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.840\nBut you always have to keep in mind,\nyou're not at the endpoint, right?\n\n160\n00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.450\nThis endpoint could be\non a LAN across the WAN,\n\n161\n00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.390\nlike great geographical distances here.\n\n162\n00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.295\nSo, it's good to have that status\nindicator that let's you know\n\n163\n00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:05.835\nwhether it's actually working.\n\n164\n00:08:05.835 --> 00:08:09.405\nSo let's go ahead and let that scan run\nin the background for a little bit, and\n\n165\n00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:14.095\nI'd like to show you some of the other\ntabs when you create that task, so\n\n166\n00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:16.025\nyou can see how you can\nmodify it a little bit.\n\n167\n00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:20.265\nSo we're just going back to the system\ntree, we're selecting the device or\n\n168\n00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:21.885\nthe workstation in question.\n\n169\n00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:25.105\nIt could be a server too,\nit's not limited to just workstations.\n\n170\n00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:29.502\nAnd we're going to Agent\n> Run Client Task.\n\n171\n00:08:29.502 --> 00:08:31.870\nWe're gonna do the same thing,\n\n172\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:37.780\nremember the VirusScan Enterprise\nOn-Demand and then create task.\n\n173\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.560\nAnd I kind of want to let you guys see\nsome of the other stuff out here cuz\n\n174\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.310\nit really has a lot of options,\nit's really powerful here.\n\n175\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.480\nYou can see,\nguys if you've ever run an antivirus scan,\n\n176\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.040\nit's really not much different than what\nyou would run on a consumer edition right?\n\n177\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.900\nBut we're controlling it from another\nlocation and we can dictate whatever\n\n178\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.640\nthe criteria's or the parameters\nof the scan, which is really cool.\n\n179\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.530\nNow exclusions.\n\n180\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.190\nLet's say I'm gonna pick on Dan here,\nI'm gonna scan Dan's computer.\n\n181\n00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.450\nBut Dan is one of our residential\nsecurity gurus, our security expert.\n\n182\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.006\nWell, he might have a location within\nhis computer where he's got software\n\n183\n00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:16.360\nthat's maybe is sometimes seen and\nflagged as a virus, when it's not.\n\n184\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.040\nIt's his, most of your administrative\ntools can also be used for\n\n185\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.145\nbad purposes too.\n\n186\n00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:26.850\nBut an antivirus scan sees that,\nit quarantines it and then deletes it.\n\n187\n00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.480\nWell, now that's a bad day, right?\n\n188\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.900\nNow Dan can't do his job.\n\n189\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.710\nSo, what I can do is I can say,\nyou know what,\n\n190\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.830\nI'm gonna add that folder, maybe we've\ntalked beforehand, scan the computer,\n\n191\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.190\nI'm on vacation, but\ndon't take away my files that I need.\n\n192\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.390\nSo you can add some exclusions here too.\n\n193\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.860\n>> Yeah, I've actually had that happen to\nme before where I've tried to install some\n\n194\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.670\nsoftware for administration purposes.\n\n195\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.960\nThings like port scanners and password\ncrackers and things of that nature.\n\n196\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.750\nAnd if it's in the wrong folder,\n\n197\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.510\nlet me tell you how fast that stuff\nget's deleted, about immediately.\n\n198\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.540\n>> One of our other hosts here too, Mike,\n\n199\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.110\nwas telling me that when he was\ngoing through CEH training,\n\n200\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.310\nthey give you, obviously, certain tools\nand utilities so that you can be aware.\n\n201\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.660\nIf you wanna detect a criminal,\nmaybe you gotta become a criminal.\n\n202\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.290\nNow I'm not saying Mike's a criminal here,\nbut [LAUGH].\n\n203\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.585\n>> But Mike's a criminal.\n\n204\n00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:16.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> So while he was going through\n\n205\n00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.480\nhis studies,\n\n206\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.620\nthe teacher did give him a software\npackage that was put on the machine.\n\n207\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.130\nAnd he said one of the first things\nthat happens when he downloaded it to\n\n208\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.900\nthe machine is his\nantivirus scan wiped it.\n\n209\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.470\nSo, you do wanna set those exclusions and\nthere again, that's a good example too.\n\n210\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.360\nThings like NMAP, sometimes they don't,\nbut sometimes they do.\n\n211\n00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.850\nNow, what happens if it finds a virus?\n\n212\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.130\nWhat happens if it finds\nsomething that's malicious?\n\n213\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.410\nWell, what are we gonna do with it?\n\n214\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.290\nWell, this is where we get\nthe ability if we need to,\n\n215\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.500\nwhen a threat's found,\nwhat do you wanna do?\n\n216\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.680\nNow I've got it set to clean the file,\ndelete the file.\n\n217\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.640\nIf no cleaner is found, just delete it.\n\n218\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.750\nIf you don't know what to do with it,\nget rid of it.\n\n219\n00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.330\nPerformance, remember the other thing that\nI told you about is that when it comes to\n\n220\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330\nthe performance,\nit can be very CPU intensive.\n\n221\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.830\nAnd if you've got somebody,\n\n222\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.550\nmaybe you're supporting a company\nthat does computer aided animation or\n\n223\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.340\ncomputer aided design, those are really,\nreally intensive processes.\n\n224\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.450\nAnd you certainly don't want somebody\nworking on the next greatest movie, and\n\n225\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.870\nin the middle of whatever they are doing,\nyour scan starts running and\n\n226\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.040\ntheir performance just completely drops.\n\n227\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.010\nProductivities lost, and that's really\nnot a good day at the office either.\n\n228\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.570\nSo, you can defer these too.\n\n229\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.340\nHere's another thing.\n\n230\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.830\nImagine if you're,\ncuz you can reach out across the internet,\n\n231\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.930\nin another location,\nwhat if the person's got a laptop and\n\n232\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.520\nthey're in the middle of a presentation,\nbattery power's draining.\n\n233\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.270\nWell, we can say,\n\n234\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.250\nyou know what, if you're on battery power,\nwe're not gonna run that scan.\n\n235\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.390\nWe're gonna wait til\nyou plug into the wall.\n\n236\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.400\nThen the moment you plug into\nthe wall all bets are off and\n\n237\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.150\nwe're gonna scan the computer.\n\n238\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.540\n>> And one of my favorites was, back at a\njob I worked at we had an older version of\n\n239\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.400\nSymantec and it would run a full and\nintensive scan, every time they logged in.\n\n240\n00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.470\n>> Oh.\n>> It was amazing.\n\n241\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.940\nPeople were like,\nwhy is my computer so slow?\n\n242\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.640\nEvery time I come back from lunch,\nthis thing is horribly slow.\n\n243\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.280\nAnd, it was doing exactly\nwhat we're trying to\n\n244\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.110\nnot do right here with this system.\n\n245\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.490\nIs it's just running these scans, and\nhad to figure a way to shut that off.\n\n246\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.410\nWe couldn't figure out why\nthat was even an option.\n\n247\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.800\n>> And sometimes its buried there.\n\n248\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.060\nSo, it is good to pay attention to that\ndocumentation, whatever the product is you\n\n249\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.860\nmight have because again, remember,\nwe talk about security a lot around here.\n\n250\n00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.670\nYou know, CIA, and we're not talking\nabout worrying about a government agency.\n\n251\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.170\nConfidentiality, Integrity,\nand Availability.\n\n252\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.320\nThe authorized users have to have access\nto the systems if they are authorized to\n\n253\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.005\nhave access to.\n\n254\n00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:42.340\nAnd if they don't, you know it brings\ndown their productivity level, well\n\n255\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.559\nthen availability is lost and then you're\ncontrary to your security principles.\n\n256\n00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.120\nThe other thing that we might wanna do,\nis we might wanna report.\n\n257\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.960\nWell we can do that too.\n\n258\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.240\nSo, from the Report tab here, you can tell\n\n259\n00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.280\nthe machine where you wanna drop the log\nfiles so you have them available too.\n\n260\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.560\nMight use some kind of file replication\ntechnology and replicate it back to\n\n261\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.300\na centralized file server, however\nyou have your infrastructure set up.\n\n262\n00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.810\nThen I can also run additional tasks\nif I want I can say, am I gonna\n\n263\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.120\nrun this task against a server, against\na work station, so if I'm creating,\n\n264\n00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.620\nmaybe not in this situation where\nit's kind of like a one-off task.\n\n265\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.500\nBut if I wanna create a task against\nlet's say my entire server farm.\n\n266\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.200\nYou probably don't wanna do that,\nbut maybe a bunch of work stations.\n\n267\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.940\nI can say no, don't run it on the work\nstations, run it on the server, or\n\n268\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.100\nvice versa.\n\n269\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.520\nRun it on the work stations and\nstay away from the servers.\n\n270\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.520\nSo I think we've probably\ngot enough time there.\n\n271\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.700\nWe'll go back and\nsee if that scan has completed.\n\n272\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.100\nOh look, it's already told me\nthat something has been detected.\n\n273\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.690\nThat's pretty interesting there.\n\n274\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.720\nSo, we're gonna hold off on seeing\nwhat it's actually detected,\n\n275\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.990\ncuz I think it's time,\n\n276\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.330\nDan, as we've been doing a lot in this\nseries, to put this software to its test.\n\n277\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.700\nSee if it's gonna make its money for\nus, or\n\n278\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.080\nwe're getting our money's worth, I guess.\n\n279\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.651\nIt's maybe not making us any money.\n\n280\n00:14:00.651 --> 00:14:02.304\n[LAUGH]\n>> Gonna give it the black plague there?\n\n281\n00:14:02.304 --> 00:14:03.322\n>> That's right.\n\n282\n00:14:03.322 --> 00:14:05.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, a couple of things.\n\n283\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.410\nWe always have to warn you guys,\nsome of the tests that we run\n\n284\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.930\nare industry standard test\nfiles that are completely safe,\n\n285\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.500\nthey're harmless,\ntesting real time protection.\n\n286\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.400\nOthers that we run are viruses.\n\n287\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.080\nSo, if you do this,\nhere's the whole disclaimer thing, but\n\n288\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.400\nyou really have to be careful.\n\n289\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.990\nDon't infect your own network trying\nto test it, use virtualization.\n\n290\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.650\nIf you're gonna test this product, use it\nin a quarantine fashion that it doesn't\n\n291\n00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.430\nbring down a production network, because\nyou don't wanna test a piece of software\n\n292\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.240\nand then in the middle of the test, you\nactually ruin your production environment.\n\n293\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.290\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n294\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:47.402\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll see if this machine can,\n\n295\n00:14:47.402 --> 00:14:52.330\nuh-oh, apparently I don't know\nhow to type a password in.\n\n296\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.640\n>> It is very difficult.\n\n297\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.670\n>> It is, oh, and I still don't.\n\n298\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.343\nThird strike and I'm out, right.\n\n299\n00:15:01.242 --> 00:15:02.380\nOh, there we go.\n\n300\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:10.020\nSo it got it right away and it let me know\nthat it found it, and it took care of it.\n\n301\n00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.480\nNow let's go back over\nto our machine here and\n\n302\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.705\nlet's see what kind of\nthreat event we have.\n\n303\n00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:20.260\nNow, I did that kind of fast here so\nlet me go ahead real quick and\n\n304\n00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.660\njust back up a little bit.\n\n305\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.060\nI get all excited about this and\nI just click through it and\n\n306\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.350\nyou guys don't get to see it out there and\nit defeats the purpose there.\n\n307\n00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.450\nNotice, down here at the bottom,\nwhen I select,\n\n308\n00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:36.940\nthis is the location that we've been\nin when looking at the machine itself.\n\n309\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.640\nBut what I want is thread events.\n\n310\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.500\nAnd I can see that a thread event was\ndetected, and it's generated, and\n\n311\n00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.670\nlet's see what happened to it.\n\n312\n00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.850\nAll right, now this I don't\nbelieve is that EICAR virus scan.\n\n313\n00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.890\nNo, in fact this is not.\n\n314\n00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.360\nThis is actually a trojan.\n\n315\n00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.200\nAnd you can see that\nthe malware was detected.\n\n316\n00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.550\nOur sensitivity, we set an alert.\n\n317\n00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:09.230\nThe threat name, what type it was,\ndeleted and, was it handled, equals true.\n\n318\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.610\nLooks like it has done its job and\nit has deleted it and\n\n319\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.760\nremediated it from the client.\n\n320\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.220\nSo that's a very good thing when you\nhave some kind of infection like that.\n\n321\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.040\nSo keep in mind, if you have multiple\ninfections going on on a single machine,\n\n322\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.800\nwell, instead of waiting on the help desk\ncall, it might be time to proactively call\n\n323\n00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.330\nthat person and say hey,\nwhat are you doing here?\n\n324\n00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.740\nWhere are you going on a company machine\nthat keeps getting infected here?\n\n325\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.690\nSo really good information, good to be\nable I want to see that information and\n\n326\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.920\nbe a little bit more proactive.\n\n327\n00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.430\nNow I know that this is reactive right,\n\n328\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.560\nwe're waiting until we see something\ngo on and then we're responding to it.\n\n329\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.760\nBut if it becomes a trend over\ntime using these reports,\n\n330\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.490\nthen it might be time to\nimplement some proactive solution.\n\n331\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.080\nProactive solution, guys, could be\nsecurity training and awareness, or\n\n332\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.920\njust security training and awareness.\n\n333\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.010\nPolicies, procedures, and awareness,\ncould make an end-user aware of,\n\n334\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.950\nwhy don't I open that\nemail attachment from\n\n335\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:12.910\nthe email that came from across\nthe country, and I have no clue who it is.\n\n336\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.260\nSo It's good, like I said,\nhave all that information in one location,\n\n337\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.080\nbe able to centrally manage it, be able\nto push the information out to your\n\n338\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.890\nworkstations, go ahead and\ninitiate scans, get the results of those\n\n339\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.640\nscans back all in a centralized location,\nmakes it a lot easier for us, Dan.\n\n340\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.030\n>> Awesome, well thank you so much Wes,\n\n341\n00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.120\nis there any other thing that we need to\nknow about McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator?\n\n342\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.440\n>> No, you know the only thing,\nI'd like to leave on a note that just\n\n343\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.350\nsays if you're gonna use this software,\nmake sure that it's up to date.\n\n344\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.850\nIf you do not update your definitions,\nif you do not patch up your systems,\n\n345\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.585\nthen you're taking a few steps back\nin ruining your infrastructure right?\n\n346\n00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:54.185\nNothing like putting in\n$100,000 security system and\n\n347\n00:17:54.185 --> 00:17:56.725\nputting a doorstop in the door and\nleaving it open.\n\n348\n00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:59.855\nNow a 50 cent product has\nruined your entire security.\n\n349\n00:17:59.855 --> 00:18:02.620\nSo just make sure that you\nupdate those systems so\n\n350\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.900\nthey can be aware of the current viruses.\n\n351\n00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.210\n>> Well excellent, thank you so\nmuch for this demonstration, and\n\n352\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.260\nthank you for watching.\n\n353\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.350\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n354\n00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.980\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n355\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.920\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n356\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.731\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n357\n00:18:14.731 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.250\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.620\nin today's episode,\nwe are moving on with more antivirus,\n\n5\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.730\nanti malware, looking at mobile device\nsecurity in this particular episode.\n\n6\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.290\nAnd joining me yet again to lend\nhis expertise, on said topic,\n\n7\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.020\nis none other than my friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.850\nWes, welcome to the show,\nhow you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.510\n>> Oh it's great, man.\n\n10\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.470\nIt's always good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.950\nThanks for having me back,\nand that's right,\n\n12\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.180\nwe're gonna be moving\ninto mobile security.\n\n13\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.900\nAnd the first one that we're gonna\nlook at is something known as Avast.\n\n14\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.630\nNow you've seen some of the Avast episode,\nand if you haven't seen the Avast episode,\n\n15\n00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.480\ngo back and watch it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.940\nCuz really,\nwe're working on just the workstation.\n\n17\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.090\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n18\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.180\nsee what you would use if you were\ntalking about mobile devices.\n\n19\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.730\nAvast is a pretty straightforward program,\nand I've actually got it pulled up here,\n\n20\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.520\nready for us all to go.\n\n21\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.380\nNow I'm going to go ahead and launch\nthis and one of the first things that\n\n22\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.890\nyou're going to see is well,\nI've got a problem, obviously.\n\n23\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.730\nNow, I can tell you what the problem\nis in the background, I've got USB\n\n24\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.400\ndebugging on it, and it doesn't like that\nbecause it's a potential vulnerability,\n\n25\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.556\nso that's that problem that\nwe're seeing right there.\n\n26\n00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:19.020\nNow, a few of the different things that\nyou have that are available right on this\n\n27\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.350\nheads up menu, you'll see that you have\nsomething known as the App Shield,\n\n28\n00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.940\nthe Web Shield, File Shield and\nMessage Shield.\n\n29\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.360\nNow when it comes to the App Shield,\nif we look into that,\n\n30\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.820\nit lets you know that it scans the\napplications on your phone for viruses.\n\n31\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.530\nWe can scan apps when they execute,\nwhen they come online.\n\n32\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.790\nWe can also use reputation services,\n\n33\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.300\njust like a lot of the other products\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n34\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.960\nA web reputation service,\na database of known processes,\n\n35\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.450\nknown reputable apps, and if something\ngoes on the phone that's contrary to that,\n\n36\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.749\nalso maybe even known to be malicious,\nit can stop it right there in its tracks.\n\n37\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.450\nNow the other thing that we\nhave here is the Web Shield.\n\n38\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.590\nAnd with the Web Shield, the Web Shield\nallows us to protect ourselves when we're\n\n39\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.590\nweb browsing from things like phishing\nscams, if you will, malicious websites.\n\n40\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.010\nWebsites have,\ngo in those reputation databases as well.\n\n41\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.600\nThey'll be known for\npropagating things like Malware, Trojans,\n\n42\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.210\nviruses if you will, worms and then of\ncourse the good old phishing scams where\n\n43\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.110\nthey're trying to get your\nsensitive information,\n\n44\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.880\nlog in as you on your bank account and\nthen turn around and wipe your account.\n\n45\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.200\nNow we've got a couple of other\nshields that are on here too.\n\n46\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.240\nWe've got what's known as the file shield,\nnow the file shield and\n\n47\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.480\nby the way guys let me mention\nwith these shields here.\n\n48\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.410\nAll of this is their real time protection.\n\n49\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.790\nSo there's four different categories,\nwe're up to the third one here, and\n\n50\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.030\nit is real time protection,\nwhich is really good.\n\n51\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.740\nSo the moment Avast Mobile Security\nturns on, or your phone initiates,\n\n52\n00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.350\nyou've got these going out the gate before\nyou even start using your phone, and\n\n53\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.125\nthat's a really good thing to have.\n\n54\n00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:01.090\nFile Shield, again,\nwhat this does is it just scans the files\n\n55\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.600\non the device's external storage\nwhen it's going to be used.\n\n56\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.080\nSo it's nice to have this.\n\n57\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.120\nNow, you've got a couple of options.\n\n58\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.380\nAll right, you can scan the files when\nthey're just being read from, right?\n\n59\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.280\nSometimes that's not as much\nof a vulnerability as when\n\n60\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.980\nthey're writing to the external location,\nright?\n\n61\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.580\nIf a virus gets in there, it's gonna try\nto write to these different locations,\n\n62\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.860\nso I've actually got,\n\n63\n00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.060\nif you'll see here, the scan files when\nreading, I've got that just disabled.\n\n64\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.250\nBut I do have the scan\nfiles when writing enabled.\n\n65\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.280\nAgain It's more of a vulnerability there.\n\n66\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.540\nNow, one of the last shields that we have\nis something called the Message Shield.\n\n67\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.380\nRight, we're always, on your phone\nyou're gonna be receiving texts,\n\n68\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.940\nyou're gonna be sending texts.\n\n69\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.080\nHave you ever got a text\nthat's got a link in it?\n\n70\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.050\nWell, what happens if you click the link?\n\n71\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.100\nIt redirects you through whatever\nyour browser's choice is and\n\n72\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.000\ndo you have any confirmation\nother than maybe, for\n\n73\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.150\ninstance let's say Dan\nsent me a text message.\n\n74\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.660\nWell I know Dan and I know, he's not gonna\nsit there and send some malicious link,\n\n75\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.680\nbut what if you receive something from\nsomebody else that you don't know?\n\n76\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.600\nRight.\nIt's very easy to open it up and\n\n77\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.880\naccidentally click on the link and\n\n78\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.100\nnow you've been re-directed\nto some malicious website.\n\n79\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.500\nSo the Message Shield works by\nscanning and you can see your sms or\n\n80\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.850\nmessages if you will, for\nphishing scams, mis-typed URLs.\n\n81\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.963\nHow many times, just accidentally,\n\n82\n00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:24.070\nnot even really maliciously have\nyou mis-typed a site like Google?\n\n83\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.870\nPut a few too many o's in there, right?\n\n84\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.200\nWell you don't want to go to some of those\nsites because they like to put things like\n\n85\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.120\nthat into the search engine on purpose so\nyou'll go to their website,\n\n86\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.360\nand not go to somebody who is reputable,\nlike Google.\n\n87\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.050\nSo we can do that as well.\n\n88\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.960\nAnd also from unknown numbers,\nwhich is really really good.\n\n89\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.410\nIt's a really good protection to have.\n\n90\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.340\nSo these shields that we have, Dan here,\nyou know real time protection, ready to go\n\n91\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.090\nthe moment the phone comes on, and it's\nsomething that you really need to have,\n\n92\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.000\nand it's nice to have it across the board.\n\n93\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.170\n>> Yeah it really seems like\na full fledged anti virus,\n\n94\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.860\nanti malware system for\nour mobile devices.\n\n95\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.340\nI mean,\nyou gotta remember in today's day and\n\n96\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.900\nage, what are you accessing internet\nconnectivity with normally?\n\n97\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.720\nProbably your phone.\n\n98\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.270\nNow if you're sitting at your desk,\n\n99\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.670\nobviously you're gonna\nbe using your computer.\n\n100\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.230\nMaybe if you're at home,\nmaybe it's through a laptop,\n\n101\n00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.330\nwhich is technically a mobile\ndevice if you think about it.\n\n102\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.720\nSo we gotta have some sorta protection for\nthat.\n\n103\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.670\nAvast really seems to have\nthat game down to a science.\n\n104\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.860\nI mean, they are just about protecting you\nfrom everything except atomic bombs there,\n\n105\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.395\nWesley?\n\n106\n00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:28.230\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely,\nthey've really got it down pat.\n\n107\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.880\nThis is a trial version that I have.\n\n108\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.130\n>> But with the different\nshields that's built into it,\n\n109\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.590\nyou don't have to pay a subscription.\n\n110\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.140\nSo it's nice to have a little bit of\nflair in a free piece of software.\n\n111\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.500\nNow we also have to look\nat our scans right?\n\n112\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.250\nThe purpose of having antivirus software,\nright,\n\n113\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.530\nmobile security obviously does\nmore than just antivirus.\n\n114\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.790\nI figure it's an anti-virus show.\n\n115\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.770\nWe should probably talk a little\nbit about anti-virus scans.\n\n116\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.700\nNow with the anti-virus scans, you can\nset up how you want it to scan, and\n\n117\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.080\nyou can refine the parameters of the scan.\n\n118\n00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.880\nSo we can go up here and\n\n119\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.330\nlet me change this around just\na little bit here, there we go.\n\n120\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.720\nNotice that I have another heads up menu,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.510\nI've got a few different tools, and some\nof these other tools, we're gonna mention\n\n122\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.980\nthem in some other episodes, but we really\nwanna focus in on the virus scanner.\n\n123\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.500\nNow when the virus scanner first loads,\nagain it does have a security risk,\n\n124\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.035\nso you're saying, hey Wes, great software,\nand you don't keep your phone protected.\n\n125\n00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:30.570\n[LAUGH] It also pays attention\nto settings that you have\n\n126\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.560\nthat are contrary to what they know.\n\n127\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.460\nIt's like a BPA,\nlike a best practice analysis that says,\n\n128\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.100\nhey, do you have the developer\ntools turned on?\n\n129\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.960\nDo you have USB debugging?\n\n130\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.380\nAnd some of you guys that have been\nAndroid know that yes that's great when\n\n131\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.280\nyou want to do some extra stuff to your\nphone that's normally locked down.\n\n132\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.460\nRight, it's great for\nexperimenting and stuff like that.\n\n133\n00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.980\nBut it's also a security vulnerability and\n\n134\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.050\nthat's one of the real time scans\nthat's going on in the background.\n\n135\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.360\nCompletely unrelated to anti\nvirus that's helping protect us.\n\n136\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.900\nNow you can see that these are the results\nof a scan that I made earlier.\n\n137\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.420\nAll right.\n\n138\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.400\nRather then make you guys\nwait thru a long scan here,\n\n139\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.760\nI wanna show you the results already.\n\n140\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.680\nNotice I say long,\nit's only a couple of minutes here.\n\n141\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.070\nBut I can refine this too.\n\n142\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.915\nNotice that I have Folders to scan.\n\n143\n00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:19.905\nI can tell it where do I want it to scan,\nright.\n\n144\n00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:23.365\nMaybe I just want it to scan\nthe SD card that's in the phone.\n\n145\n00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:26.515\nWell, I could say that too, I can scan the\nwhole entire device or I could just say,\n\n146\n00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:31.065\nfor instance,\njust scan the external storage.\n\n147\n00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.525\nI could also set up automatic scans,\nright.\n\n148\n00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:38.755\nThe automatic scan, if I choose that,\nthis gives me the ability to schedule,\n\n149\n00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:41.160\nwe're gonna come back to\nthat in a second here.\n\n150\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.170\nLet's looks at some of the other\ncriterias of the scan too.\n\n151\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.214\nScan results, all right.\n\n152\n00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.367\nNotice that the scan results,\nremember I was telling you\n\n153\n00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:52.767\nthat it says there is a problem, a\nsecurity problem, that's been detected and\n\n154\n00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:56.985\nyou can see that what it's telling me\nis hey USB debugging is turned on here.\n\n155\n00:07:56.985 --> 00:08:00.997\nAgain, it's just telling me that that's\nnot a best practice, but it's okay,\n\n156\n00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:03.920\nI'm the one that set it and\nI'm okay with that.\n\n157\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.500\nWe also have an ignore list.\n\n158\n00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.507\nYou might have locations on your phone for\nwhatever reason you don't want\n\n159\n00:08:10.507 --> 00:08:15.592\nthem to get searched, so just like any\nvirus solution that you might have,\n\n160\n00:08:15.592 --> 00:08:19.900\nyou also have the ability\nto have some exclusions.\n\n161\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.190\nNow let's look a little bit\nmore at the automatic scan.\n\n162\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.790\nYou wanna schedule a scan,\nwell you can define the criteria for\n\n163\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.960\nsetting up a scan, right?\n\n164\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.520\nI can scan just the applications.\n\n165\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.860\nNow I have both of these turned on,\nright I can scan the applications,\n\n166\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.462\nor apps if you will, or\nI can also scan the files.\n\n167\n00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:41.900\nI can tell it what date, I say date,\nbut day, what day do I want it to scan?\n\n168\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.900\nAnd do I want it to repeat, and\nwhat time of day do I want it to scan?\n\n169\n00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.730\nAnd once we have that criteria we\ncan then turn around and confirm it.\n\n170\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.220\nNow I've already got one set up here,\n\n171\n00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.470\nso we're gonna go ahead and\njust close that down.\n\n172\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.150\nSo scan's not too hard to set up,\nreally cool software.\n\n173\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.810\nHow about this,\nwe talked a little bit about applications,\n\n174\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.780\nmaybe you want to manage\nyour applications, right?\n\n175\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.600\nYou wanna do something like lock\na certain application down.\n\n176\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.060\nWell you can do that as well.\n\n177\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.393\nWhen you go to I probably just\nshut that down, okay there we go.\n\n178\n00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:19.654\nIf you wanna do things like app\nblocking or locking, if you will,\n\n179\n00:09:19.654 --> 00:09:22.340\nyou go to the more tools here.\n\n180\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.540\nAnd there are plenty of extra tools here,\nlike an anti-theft tool that's really,\n\n181\n00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.300\nreally cool, I really like that.\n\n182\n00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.460\nBut what I'm looking at is app locking.\n\n183\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.890\nMaybe I've got certain apps that I\nknow are going to send information,\n\n184\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.580\nmy data right, out.\n\n185\n00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.680\nNotice it says that I've got a few\nthat are recommended to lock.\n\n186\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.270\nWell, maybe I don't want\nsomebody getting on my phone and\n\n187\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.110\npotentially connecting to\nthe Google Play store.\n\n188\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.929\nSo you can do that as well.\n\n189\n00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:50.210\nSo you do have the ability, for instance,\nto lock down things like web browsers.\n\n190\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.570\nLet's say this is your kid's phone, right?\n\n191\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.390\nMaybe I don't want them\nusing certain applications.\n\n192\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.200\nMaybe as a parent, you wanna control,\ncuz it's your account.\n\n193\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.910\nBe careful if you are doing that,\n\n194\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.120\nyou don't want them going\nto the Google Play store.\n\n195\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.830\nWell you can do that likewise too.\n\n196\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.880\nNow when we do things like\napplication management,\n\n197\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.930\nthe app management is a lot like the app.\n\n198\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.280\nIn fact, it's just like the built-in\napplication manager there too.\n\n199\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.030\nSo if you go to App Management we\nalso have the ability to look at, for\n\n200\n00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.340\ninstance, some of the data.\n\n201\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.370\nThey got system info,\n\n202\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.210\nwhere you can clean the information\nthat might be on the phone too.\n\n203\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.530\nAnd that's really good for things like\nprivacy, more so than it is just viruses.\n\n204\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.160\nBut it's a really,\nreally good thing to have.\n\n205\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.165\nSo for the most part, Dan,\nyou don't Avast is a good program,\n\n206\n00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:41.656\nyou know there's a lot of extra\nfeatures in there, it's very modular.\n\n207\n00:10:41.656 --> 00:10:45.564\nJust because I have this, you can see\nthere's a laundry list of different\n\n208\n00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:49.534\nfeatures that you can add, and we'll\ntalk about some of the other ones here\n\n209\n00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:52.577\nin other episodes, not so\nmuch here in the anti-virus.\n\n210\n00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:57.937\nCuz for instance it's got a really cool\nfeature that when I connect the wi-fi,\n\n211\n00:10:57.937 --> 00:11:02.577\ndo I want to find out is that wi-fi\ndevice does it have a password set,\n\n212\n00:11:02.577 --> 00:11:04.260\nis it using encryption?\n\n213\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.770\nIs it a weak encryption or\na strong encryption?\n\n214\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.370\nIs is vulnerable to\ncertain types of exploit?\n\n215\n00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.859\nSo you can really expand\nthe functionality of this device.\n\n216\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.480\nNow there is one other technology\nthat's up here that I think\n\n217\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.710\nreally falls in line with what\nwe are trying to convey, right,\n\n218\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.860\nthat is called\nthe Avast Ransomware Removal tool.\n\n219\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.890\nHave you ever got maybe at\na workstation where you get that,\n\n220\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.760\nwhat's the legendary one,\nthe FBI virus I think is one.\n\n221\n00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.600\nRight, you download,\nit locks everything up, or\n\n222\n00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.300\nyou get one that's a spoofed AV software,\nand it looks legitimate.\n\n223\n00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.550\nOf course, the only thing that it's gonna\nallow you to do is go to their bogus web\n\n224\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.490\nserver and pay them money, and of course\nthey're gonna drain your account.\n\n225\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.930\nWell, Avast also has that as well, and\n\n226\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.570\nI'm gonna let this run here, but\nI do want you to be careful.\n\n227\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.690\nHowever, I don't know exactly why\nthey've got it built this way, but\n\n228\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.370\nit's gonna scan every\napplication on your phone.\n\n229\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.640\nAnd one of the things that it's gonna\nrequire you to do after it finishes\n\n230\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.680\nscanning your different applications\nis you have to uninstall it.\n\n231\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.550\nAnd I'm not exactly sure why they do that,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n232\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.160\nThis one, if you think you've\ngot ransomware, it scans,\n\n233\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.030\nI don't know if it's cuz it locks\neverything down or something.\n\n234\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.550\nBut it'll go through the process of\nscanning all of your applications, and\n\n235\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.710\nthen once it's done, it's gonna tell you,\nhey, you're gonna have to uninstall it.\n\n236\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.690\nSo hey, when it comes to Avast we really\ndo have some fairly good technologies\n\n237\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.310\nthere, Dan, that can help us\nprotect our mobile devices.\n\n238\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.910\n>> Yeah, seems to be quite\nthe comprehensive suite of software there\n\n239\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.290\nto keep our mobile devices in check,\nin order and the way we like them.\n\n240\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.610\nWe don't want those viruses have\nmany different ways of locking down.\n\n241\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.190\nI assume though that it's not the only\ngame in town, that there are competitors.\n\n242\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.100\n>> That's right, we've got a couple\nother devices here too, or\n\n243\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.909\na couple other applications as well.\n\n244\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.090\nNow the next one that we have is\nsomething known as AVG mobile.\n\n245\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.020\nAnd you guys have probably seen AVG out\nthere, in fact they've got a really\n\n246\n00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.360\ngood free consumer product for\nyou know your workstations.\n\n247\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.980\nAnd again, this one is one\nthat's not really too difficult\n\n248\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.870\nonce you know where you're going and\nkind of how to use it.\n\n249\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.012\nSo, Let's go ahead and look at that,\n\n250\n00:13:20.012 --> 00:13:24.934\nnow with the AVG Antivirus here,\nyou get a heads-up menu.\n\n251\n00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:28.070\nYou would see the protection right away,\nwhat you have.\n\n252\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.900\nAgain, this is another one that's modular,\nso it will use in app purchases.\n\n253\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.780\nSo, You can add to its\nfunctionality if you need to.\n\n254\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.504\nWe can add the antitheft, and\nyou can see that performance and privacy.\n\n255\n00:13:38.504 --> 00:13:40.716\nYou know, clean up your phone and\n\n256\n00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:43.960\nhopefully help her perform\na little bit better.\n\n257\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.630\nBut what we're really looking for\nis this protection tile here.\n\n258\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.050\nSo we'll go ahead and choose that.\n\n259\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.150\nNow on the protection tile,\nyou can see that we can run a scan.\n\n260\n00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.440\nI have the ability to update, so\n\n261\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.600\nif I haven't updated in a while\nI can run the update and\n\n262\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.450\nit connects out to AVG servers and\nit pulls down the current database.\n\n263\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.080\n>> Something we're always\nharping on quite a bit actually.\n\n264\n00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.480\nDefinitions are updated.\n\n265\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.900\n>> Better keep them up to date, right?\n\n266\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.050\nAnd that's right, we have said,\nif you're gonna put antivirus software\n\n267\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.860\non your computer and then not update it,\nit's really no reason to even\n\n268\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.070\nhave it on your computer, or\nin this case, your mobile devices.\n\n269\n00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.200\nNow we also have the file\nscanner likewise too.\n\n270\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.590\nAnd we choose the file scanner, it gives\nus the ability to scan different files.\n\n271\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.580\nLike, maybe for instance,\n\n272\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.020\nthe SD card that's in here,\nmaybe I wanna scan my external storage.\n\n273\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.300\nWell, I have the ability that if I want,\n\n274\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.030\nI can scan just the external storage or\nany of the folders in here.\n\n275\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.416\nIf you happen to have a place,\n\n276\n00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.911\nlike your download folder there that\nthings are constantly downloading,\n\n277\n00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:49.806\nmaybe you wanna do an individual\nscan against that likewise.\n\n278\n00:14:51.618 --> 00:14:54.148\nThere we go, so\nsome of the other things you can do.\n\n279\n00:14:54.148 --> 00:14:56.470\nYou could extend the reach\nof this software.\n\n280\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.230\nIf I have another device,\na lot of us do, right?\n\n281\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.510\nSome of us have tablets,\nsome of us have phones.\n\n282\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.210\nWell what if I have a phone and\na tablet and\n\n283\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.360\nI wanna make sure that\nmy tablet's safe too.\n\n284\n00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.890\nWell, they've got an option here\nthat I can protect another device.\n\n285\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.430\nAnd if I want, I can download that, and\n\n286\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.870\nI can protect more than one\ndevice right from this console.\n\n287\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.885\nWhich is really cool here.\n\n288\n00:15:20.665 --> 00:15:24.375\nThe next thing that we have,\nwe have the exclusions list, right?\n\n289\n00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:28.105\nYou might have a location on your device\nthat maybe you don't want it to be\n\n290\n00:15:28.105 --> 00:15:28.605\nscanned.\n\n291\n00:15:28.605 --> 00:15:32.955\nMaybe you don't want it to find something\nthere that it might flag as a virus or\n\n292\n00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:37.055\npotential malware for whatever reason,\nand so you can do that, too.\n\n293\n00:15:37.055 --> 00:15:38.299\nYou can set exclusions.\n\n294\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.136\nNow the next thing that we have\nis the protection settings.\n\n295\n00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:45.834\nNow when we look at\nthe protection settings,\n\n296\n00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:50.455\nthis is really cool because it allows\nus the ability to set scan sensitivity.\n\n297\n00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:52.515\nNow what does scan sensitivity mean for\nus?\n\n298\n00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:56.636\nThink about heuristics,\nheuristics we don't have our answer.\n\n299\n00:15:56.636 --> 00:16:00.773\nWe're using algorithms, and\ndoing some computational, or calculations,\n\n300\n00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:05.032\nif you will, and we're trying to guess,\nI'm not really sure it's a virus, but\n\n301\n00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:08.000\nit looks like it's got\nthe characteristics of a virus.\n\n302\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.390\nWell, I could go in here, and\nI can set the sensitivity.\n\n303\n00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.766\nNow what I like about this screen here,\nwhy not say low, medium, high?\n\n304\n00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:19.149\nNo, it says low, high,\nand extra sensitive.\n\n305\n00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:23.300\n[LAUGH] So interesting there, but\nrecommended, you can see, is the high\n\n306\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.980\nlevel, because when you use the extra\nsensitive or extra sensitivity,, then you\n\n307\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.200\ndo run the risk of having things like\nfalse positives, and that could be bad.\n\n308\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.570\nIt could be good, or it could be bad,\n\n309\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.120\nbut you get the ability\nto set it how you want.\n\n310\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.660\nNow the next thing that we can do too\nis things like scheduling the scans.\n\n311\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.516\nSo this is the auto scan frequency.\n\n312\n00:16:44.516 --> 00:16:48.560\nI can say you know what,\nscan it once a day, scan it once a week.\n\n313\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.447\nOr I could turn it off, depending on,\nhow much you use your phone.\n\n314\n00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:56.013\nA lot of us, we live by our phone, so\nmaybe we do want to scan it every single\n\n315\n00:16:56.013 --> 00:16:58.975\nday, and\nwe have that capability if we want to.\n\n316\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.810\nAll right,\nnext thing is the safe web surfing, right?\n\n317\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.260\nWe go out to different web sites,\n\n318\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.540\nwe wanna be a little bit more secure in\nthe fact that we're not connecting to some\n\n319\n00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.120\nURL that makes its way,\napplications do this too, right?\n\n320\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.410\nHow many times have you had\nan application and click on an ad and\n\n321\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.150\nit takes you out to another location,\nright?\n\n322\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.170\nAnd you're like, oh,\nI didn't click on that.\n\n323\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.110\nWell, there's not really\nanything that says that the ad\n\n324\n00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.290\nhas to be taking you out\nto a legitimate spot.\n\n325\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.705\nSo when you're surfing the web too, this\nkeeps you protected from things like those\n\n326\n00:17:33.705 --> 00:17:38.246\nphishing scams, malicious links, so you\nmaking sure you're not getting redirected\n\n327\n00:17:38.246 --> 00:17:41.729\noutbound to something that could\nalso expose your mobile device or\n\n328\n00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:44.617\nin this case your phone to\nsome kind of vulnerability.\n\n329\n00:17:44.617 --> 00:17:48.591\nThe next thing that we have is\nscanning the external storage.\n\n330\n00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:53.897\nAgain, as these external storage,\nor the SD cards get greater and\n\n331\n00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:59.700\ngreater in size, used to be two gigs,\nyou had a massive SD card, right?\n\n332\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.010\nWell, two gigs,\n\n333\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.140\nmost people today don't even want to\nput a two gig card in their phone.\n\n334\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.650\nWhat do we have,\neight gig, 16 gig, 32 gig.\n\n335\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.220\n64 gigs and I've seen some\nup there at 128 gigs, right?\n\n336\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.120\nThat could take a long time.\n\n337\n00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.703\nSo you could see that it's\ndisabled by default, but\n\n338\n00:18:14.703 --> 00:18:17.354\nmaybe you wanna make sure\nthat your device is secure.\n\n339\n00:18:17.354 --> 00:18:20.768\nMaybe you work for a company that does\nallow mobile devices to connect to their\n\n340\n00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:22.092\nwireless networks, right?\n\n341\n00:18:22.092 --> 00:18:25.006\nMaybe your security policy isn't so\n\n342\n00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:31.230\nstrict that you can connect to that\nwork device to the mobile network.\n\n343\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.440\nWell maybe in that instance, if it is\ncompany data that might be on there,\n\n344\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.360\nmaybe you do wanna say go ahead and\nonce a day,\n\n345\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.200\nif you're gonna do a scan, go ahead and\ninclude the external storage in it too.\n\n346\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.600\nBack on the heads up screen we're gonna\nlook at one more thing here in the AVG\n\n347\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.760\nantivirus software, and\nthat's the privacy tile.\n\n348\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.210\nNow, when we look at the privacy tile\nhere you're going to see that you have\n\n349\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.850\nthe ability to do app\nlocking if you need to.\n\n350\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.550\nAgain, you can, if you have an application\nthat's got sensitive information on it.\n\n351\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.520\nFor instance,\nmaybe you use last pass, right?\n\n352\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.990\nLast pass is on your phone,\nyou can enter your password every time,\n\n353\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.425\nbut maybe I don't even want to give\nsomebody the ability to do one of those\n\n354\n00:19:09.425 --> 00:19:13.440\nbrute force attacks or guessing\nattacks against my last pass account.\n\n355\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.340\nWell I can also lock it with a password\nif I want, we can also do app backup.\n\n356\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.410\nWe can also do call blocking too,\n\n357\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.770\nthat's great if you don't want\nyour in-laws talking to you.\n\n358\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.550\nBut, maybe not [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.040\nDon't do that I swear.\n\n360\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.170\nThe other thing that you also\ncan do is wiping the data and\n\n361\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.500\nthis is a good thing if it's a mobile\ndevice that is owned by a company now.\n\n362\n00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.207\nIf it is a larger corporation they might\nhave some kind of a open MDM solution,\n\n363\n00:19:37.207 --> 00:19:41.256\nmobile device management solution, but if\nnot, those give you the ability that you\n\n364\n00:19:41.256 --> 00:19:44.585\ncan wipe the information should this\nphone get into the wrong hands.\n\n365\n00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:47.855\nSo when it comes down to it,\nAVG got a lot of features in here,\n\n366\n00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:52.219\nit's very modular in app purchases, if\nyou want to extend its functionality for\n\n367\n00:19:52.219 --> 00:19:55.970\na small fee, you can do that, and\nyou don't have to get everything.\n\n368\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.780\nYou can get just the pieces that you want.\n\n369\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.280\n>> Yeah, a lot of very nice\nfeatures when it comes to\n\n370\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.790\nboth of the software suites that we've\nseen so far are for our mobile devices.\n\n371\n00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.780\nNow Wes is there anything\nelse you wanna show us,\n\n372\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.230\nany other competitors that might give\nthese guys a run for their money?\n\n373\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.370\n>> That's right, D, we've got another one.\n\n374\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.640\nWe've got the good ol Kaspersky and\nthey've got a mobile solution to.\n\n375\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.190\nWhen we look at Kaspersky, one of\nthe things that you're gonna see is,\n\n376\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.850\nwell, it's telling me hey,\nthere's a problem with your device.\n\n377\n00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.900\nAnd again,\n\n378\n00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.280\nyou'll notice a consistency across all\nthree of these different technologies.\n\n379\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.020\nThey do not like that USB\ndebugging being turned on.\n\n380\n00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.960\nThey're telling you,\nyou're susceptible to a vulnerability, so\n\n381\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.850\nyou should turn it off.\n\n382\n00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:43.360\nThe heads up menu here,\nat first is a little bit simplistic and\n\n383\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.290\nyou can get to more options\njust by choosing this up arrow.\n\n384\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.860\nYou choose the up arrow, well you've\ngot your scans that you can run, but\n\n385\n00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.820\nwhat I'd like to show you here is\nthe settings, and if I go to settings.\n\n386\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.220\nCouple of things that we're\ngoing to notice here,\n\n387\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.390\nis that we're gonna notice the scanner,\nright.\n\n388\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.090\nWhen it comes to the scanner,\nwe can set different things,\n\n389\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.810\ndifferent configurations here.\n\n390\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.720\nI've got settings here,\nscan and quarantine.\n\n391\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.900\nWhen I choose scan,\nI can choose what do I wanna do?\n\n392\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.870\nDo I want to disinfect the machine?\n\n393\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.290\nWhat kind of action should be taken?\n\n394\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.060\nIf it can't disinfect the machine, I like\nthat disinfect rather than remediate and\n\n395\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060\nquarantine.\n\n396\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.960\nAnd then setting schedules too, so\nwe can schedule scans likewise here.\n\n397\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.109\nSo really good stuff to have there.\n\n398\n00:21:28.482 --> 00:21:31.794\nAll right,\nnow the next thing is the quarantine and\n\n399\n00:21:31.794 --> 00:21:35.337\nI'll tell you what,\nwhen it comes to the quarantine,\n\n400\n00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:39.366\nthis is a very good thing to have\nas far as a list that's empty.\n\n401\n00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:43.808\nCuz when you come in here, if you've\ngot some different files in here,\n\n402\n00:21:43.808 --> 00:21:47.598\nwell the problem is,\nyou've got a lot of bugs in the system.\n\n403\n00:21:50.163 --> 00:21:56.030\nNext we're going to look at a few more\nsettings I want to talk about here too.\n\n404\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:01.760\nIf you do a scan you can see it\ndoesn't take really too long.\n\n405\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.080\nIt's tells you what it's scanning,\n\n406\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.010\nit tells you how many\nobjects are being scanned.\n\n407\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:13.400\nIf you have an account, I can control\nthis, if the phone happens to get stolen,\n\n408\n00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.880\nI can control this from the cloud, and\nthat's also a good thing to have there.\n\n409\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.840\nNow that we've looked at the scanning,\n\n410\n00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.990\nlet's define a little bit more about\nthe antivirus side of this software.\n\n411\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.070\nIn Settings,\nyou will see that we have antivirus, and\n\n412\n00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.010\nthat's where we're gonna start.\n\n413\n00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.830\nThere is the protection.\n\n414\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.110\nNow, when the protection, you have\na couple different protection modes.\n\n415\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.910\nBy default the protection mode is set\nin whats known as the recommended.\n\n416\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.160\nNow, when it says recommended,\nwhat it's doing is the antivirus\n\n417\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.900\nscan is looking at applications, but only\nthe new applications that you install..\n\n418\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.870\nIf you wanna little bit more than that,\nright, not only new files, but\n\n419\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.620\nI wanna look at when files,\nupon execution,\n\n420\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.370\nwhat's going on, this is where you get\ninto the extended protection mode.\n\n421\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.990\nNow, I'm gonna come right back to this,\n\n422\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.960\ncuz I wanna show you something that,\nif you don't enable extended mode.\n\n423\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.530\nNotice Protection down here,\n\n424\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.950\nnotice when I click on Protection\neverything is grayed out.\n\n425\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.260\nWhen you do just\nthe recommended protection mode,\n\n426\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.530\nnotice I don't have the ability\nto find anything else, so\n\n427\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.500\nit's a little bit more of\nan advanced feature, it's not so\n\n428\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.300\nadvanced that you can't figure it out\nby any means, but they do lock it down.\n\n429\n00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.229\nSo let's go back to protection mode.\n\n430\n00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.970\nAnd we're gonna change this to extended,\n\n431\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.380\nand you're gonna see something it's\ngonna be a little bit different now.\n\n432\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.950\nNow when I go back to the protection\nside of this, I can define\n\n433\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.460\ntypes of files to scan, right, I can say\napps and archives or just scan everything.\n\n434\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.726\nWhich is what we're gonna leave it here.\n\n435\n00:23:41.726 --> 00:23:46.569\nAnd then the action on threat detection,\ndo i want it to quarantine it?\n\n436\n00:23:46.569 --> 00:23:47.952\nDo I want it to delete it?\n\n437\n00:23:47.952 --> 00:23:51.606\nOr do I want it to Have a blind eye and\njust skip it.\n\n438\n00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:54.656\nNow obviously that setting's\nprobably not what we want to do, but\n\n439\n00:23:54.656 --> 00:23:58.359\nat least we have the ability, a little bit\nof flexibility to say quarantine it and\n\n440\n00:23:58.359 --> 00:24:01.191\nthen let me look at that quarantine\nlist that we checked out and\n\n441\n00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:03.770\nthen I can make a decision on\nwhat I want to do from there.\n\n442\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.340\nA couple of the other things\nthat you have here too.\n\n443\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.830\nThe scan settings again, disinfect,\nwe've looked at those, and\n\n444\n00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.710\nthat doesn't really change and\nagain that quarantine list.\n\n445\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.660\nNow we also have add ware,\nauto dialers and other,\n\n446\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.950\nyou guys have probably heard that term\nPUP, that's potentially unwanted programs.\n\n447\n00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.470\nIt doesn't really mean that\nsome of the software is bad.\n\n448\n00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.730\nIt's more of a nuisance, right?\n\n449\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.540\nSpyware is definitely something that we\ndon't want, but you can turn it on that.\n\n450\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.270\nIt can say detection of adware and\napps that can be used by intruders.\n\n451\n00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.750\nKeep in mind that your applications,\nthe majority of them, are network aware.\n\n452\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.870\nSo, if you've got an application that's\ngot a malicious bug in it, then that\n\n453\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.790\nintruder could use that application\nto make manipulations on your phone.\n\n454\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.020\nPull your data, send it out bound,\ncollect it if they want to.\n\n455\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.090\nNow one of the other things I want\nto look at is the web protection.\n\n456\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:02.160\nWeb protection, keep in mind as the other\npieces of software that we looked at,\n\n457\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.580\nwhen you click on a link, how do you know\nthat the link that you're going to isn't\n\n458\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.740\ngonna try to do some drive-by download\nwhere the moment you connect to it,\n\n459\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.700\nit starts to install software?\n\n460\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.650\nOr it implements some\nkind of phishing scam.\n\n461\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.740\nSo it's nice to have this.\n\n462\n00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:20.370\nYou can do the test antiphishing and\nweb protection.\n\n463\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.650\nNow web protection has a couple\ndifferent modes that you can set too.\n\n464\n00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.950\nNotice disable,\npretty obvious what that one is.\n\n465\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:32.950\nSo standard says, check the websites\nonly in the supported browsers.\n\n466\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:38.200\nHowever extended,\nextended says check any website in\n\n467\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.990\nany application that makes\na connection to the Internet.\n\n468\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:48.060\nSo Dan here we've got quite a few settings\nin this one, and all very very cool stuff.\n\n469\n00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.210\nIt can protect you.\n\n470\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.260\nYou got additional settings.\n\n471\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.630\nThis is another one of those that if you\nwant to make an additional purchases,\n\n472\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.690\nyou can.\n\n473\n00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.820\nAgain, modular.\n\n474\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.670\nAdd this protection just for\na little bit more money or whatever.\n\n475\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:01.960\nBut you don't have to.\n\n476\n00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.550\nAgain, it's nice to have something\nthat when you install it, if you don't\n\n477\n00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:09.540\nwant to purchase for a lot of,\nyou know all the other flair, that's okay.\n\n478\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.880\nBut at least you get the basic\nlevel of functionality.\n\n479\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.080\nAnd the basic protection.\n\n480\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.110\n>> Yeah.\nIt's definitely an excellent product.\n\n481\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.060\nI've sworn by Kaspersky.\n\n482\n00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.980\nI love their antivirus software.\n\n483\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.030\nIt does an amazing job.\n\n484\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.590\nI would expect nothing less from\ntheir mobile version as well.\n\n485\n00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.930\nGiving you a lot of control,\na lot of ability within that operating, or\n\n486\n00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.190\nnot operating system,\nbut that software suite.\n\n487\n00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.660\nTo make sure to keep your devices\nfrom getting any potential unwanteds,\n\n488\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.670\nas they were.\n\n489\n00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.450\nNow Wes,\nis there anything else about Kaspersky or\n\n490\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.990\nany other softwares that we've see today\nthat we should know just in general?\n\n491\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.700\n>> Just pay attention to\nthe common practices, right?\n\n492\n00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.620\nIt doesn't matter what\nthe antivirus software is.\n\n493\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.890\nWe've been stressing a lot is\nif you're going to download\n\n494\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:58.670\nthese antivirus solutions, make sure you\nkeep the definition databases up to date.\n\n495\n00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.200\nIf you are installing applications, right?\n\n496\n00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.440\nAnd maybe in the android world you know\nyou're installing applications from\n\n497\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.830\nunknown sources.\n\n498\n00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.810\nWell that's nice, because you can\nget some good apps out there but\n\n499\n00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.610\nyou do open your mobile device into\na potential whole bunch of risks.\n\n500\n00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.610\nSo if you are going to do something like\nthat, whichever these components or pieces\n\n501\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.930\nof software that you go with, make sure\nyou have them installed, make sure you\n\n502\n00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.200\nhave the realtime protection turned on,\nand make sure you have them up to date.\n\n503\n00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.230\n>> All right, excellent stuff.\n\n504\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.910\nThank you so much, Wes, for showing us,\n\n505\n00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:33.020\nand walking us down through these pieces\nof software, these antivirus solutions for\n\n506\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.590\nmobile devices, and\nthank you for watching today.\n\n507\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.569\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n508\n00:27:36.569 --> 00:27:39.198\nFor IT Pro TV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n509\n00:27:39.198 --> 00:27:40.120\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n510\n00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.388\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n511\n00:27:41.388 --> 00:27:46.365\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.856\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're continuing on with more\n\n4\n00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:22.040\nantivirus and anti-malware solutions.\n\n5\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.670\nAnd joining me yet again today is none\nother than my good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.685\nWes, welcome to the show.\n\n7\n00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:28.460\nHow are you, and welcome back.\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.300\n>> Thank you, it's always good\nto be here and that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.398\nWe're moving along in part two of\nour mobile device security and\n\n10\n00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:37.990\ngot a couple more products that we\nwant you guys to look at and see and\n\n11\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.620\nrealize though,\nwe got a lot of options out there.\n\n12\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.540\nAnd these next two you probably heard of,\n\n13\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.040\nthey're some common antivirus\nantimalware software.\n\n14\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.540\nOne of the first ones we're gonna look\nat is the McAfee Mobile Security Suite.\n\n15\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.970\nSo let's jump right into it and\nsee what it looks like.\n\n16\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.180\nWhen you launch this security here,\n\n17\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.750\nyou're gonna see a few different\ncategories right up at the top here.\n\n18\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.947\nOne of the first ones I wanna\nlook at is the Security Scan.\n\n19\n00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:08.763\nNow, we're gonna show you the settings,\nbut we're gonna look at basically just\n\n20\n00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:11.141\nSecurity Scan because when\nyou first look at this,\n\n21\n00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:13.590\nit doesn't look like there's much.\n\n22\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.930\nIt just gives you a quick heads up\noverview of, do you wanna scan,\n\n23\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.200\nwhen was the last scan, and\nwhat are the virus definitions?\n\n24\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.140\nOne of the things that we've been saying\nas a commonality throughout this entire\n\n25\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.085\nseries is that if you are gonna\nrun antivirus software,\n\n26\n00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:33.755\nyou're definitely gonna want to have\nthose definitions updated, downloaded so\n\n27\n00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:37.255\nthat your devices can be protected and\nmore importantly, the anti-virus\n\n28\n00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:42.155\nsoftware is aware of the most current\nviruses and threats that are out there.\n\n29\n00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:45.265\nNow, we can also set how\nthe scan's gonna happen.\n\n30\n00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:47.925\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:50.330\nLet me get out of this one first.\n\n32\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.620\nAnd if I go to Settings here, you'll see\na whole bunch of different settings.\n\n33\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.226\nWe got the Real Time Scan, now Real Time\nScan, you wanna always have this on,\n\n34\n00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.071\nyou don't really wanna disable this.\n\n35\n00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:03.503\nAnd it's as simple as just turning it on\nand off, now I'm going to leave it on\n\n36\n00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:07.098\nhere, but I just kinda wanna show you guys\nthat you could turn it off if you want,\n\n37\n00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:10.427\nbut doesn't really make much sense to\ndownload an antivirus software and\n\n38\n00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:11.630\nthen disable it, right?\n\n39\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.700\nMight as well just not even have\nit on your phone at that point.\n\n40\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.520\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and leave this on.\n\n41\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.190\nNow I can do scheduled scans,\nI can define when I want a scan to happen.\n\n42\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.410\nSo for instance,\nif I choose Scheduled Scan,\n\n43\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.390\nit's gonna tell me, well,\nif it's on, how do I wanna set it?\n\n44\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.350\nWell, I can choose the schedule,\nthe type here, and\n\n45\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.350\nI can do what's known\nas a Smart scheduler.\n\n46\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.840\nNow, a Smart scheduler says, let us decide\nwhen the best time is to do your scan.\n\n47\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.660\nWe can do a custom if we want, and\n\n48\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.280\nthen if we do a custom scan, well that's\ngonna allow us the ability to define it.\n\n49\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.830\nSo rather than just leave it as\nthe Smart Scan, which might be smart,\n\n50\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.220\nall pun intended, let's go ahead and\nshow you how to customize it.\n\n51\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.910\nIf I choose Customize you're gonna\nnotice that I have more options.\n\n52\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.180\nAnd let me just back up one bit here and\nchange that back so\n\n53\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.840\nyou can see what it went from.\n\n54\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.612\nSmart Scan, you don't have any options.\n\n55\n00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:09.515\nThey're gonna say, let us use the\njudgement that we have with the software,\n\n56\n00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:12.287\nand we'll find out when\nyou're gonna have that scan.\n\n57\n00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:14.320\nNow, why is that important?\n\n58\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.747\nWell if I'm in the middle of something,\nif I'm on the phone,\n\n59\n00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:19.876\nif I'm using an application that might\neven be a line of business application,\n\n60\n00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.137\nyou know, that's a big trend out there,\nright, BYOD.\n\n61\n00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:27.541\nWe're seeing these very,\nvery heavy inside of the business world,\n\n62\n00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:33.470\nso you might not wanna be able to\nhave your device bogging down.\n\n63\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.700\nSo if I choose Schedule type and\nI choose Custom,\n\n64\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.440\nnow notice that we have\nsome other criteria.\n\n65\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.850\nNow the first one here it says everyday.\n\n66\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.490\nNotice I'm not picking the date or\nthe day itself, right.\n\n67\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.990\nIf it's everyday there's no\nreason to schedule anything.\n\n68\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.030\nBut if I change this from everyday,\nand I say,\n\n69\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.490\nyou know what,\nI'm gonna do week, every week.\n\n70\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.010\nNow, I get to define the day.\n\n71\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.630\nAnd if I choose On,\nit gives me the days of the week here, and\n\n72\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.088\nI can define when I wanna do this.\n\n73\n00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:04.550\nMaybe I wanna do it on Monday,\nmaybe I want to do it on Friday.\n\n74\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.753\nThe beginning of the week, the end of\nthe week, that's really up to you,\n\n75\n00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:09.214\nwhatever you set your criteria.\n\n76\n00:04:12.278 --> 00:04:16.550\nNow the next thing that we're\ngonna look at here is Auto Update.\n\n77\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.460\nNow it's interesting,\n\n78\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.508\nboth of these two features allow\nyou to do the same thing, right?\n\n79\n00:04:21.508 --> 00:04:23.880\nIf I'm gonna schedule a scan I\ncan use the Smart Scheduler,\n\n80\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.610\nlet them figure out when to do it.\n\n81\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.280\nI can set a custom schedule, and I can\ntell the phone when I want it to happen.\n\n82\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.040\nWell, it's the same thing\nwith the updater, right?\n\n83\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.840\nYou might not want to be\nusing a lot of bandwidth,\n\n84\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.070\nmaybe you have a metered connection.\n\n85\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.240\nMost of us do typically have\na metered connection, right?\n\n86\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.310\nThat's why we pay our data plans.\n\n87\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.370\nBut maybe you are on a data cap,\nmaybe you have a limited amount of data.\n\n88\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.920\nSo you might not want this\nwhen you're over the road.\n\n89\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.813\nIf you're getting to the end of\nyour billing cycle [LAUGH] and\n\n90\n00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:55.322\nmaybe you're one of those ones that\nsends a lot of information outbound.\n\n91\n00:04:55.322 --> 00:04:58.830\nI might say, you know what,\nlet me let them do it and decide when.\n\n92\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.990\nWell, they've also got\na Smart Scheduler for this one too.\n\n93\n00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.280\nSettings are exactly the same as what\nwe've seen as far the scan settings go.\n\n94\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.100\nBut this is good when you have\nsomething like a metered connection, or\n\n95\n00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.405\nyou're worried about a data cap.\n\n96\n00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:12.480\nAnd again,\nmaybe towards the end of the month,\n\n97\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.220\nyou start seeing that you're right\nthere at the end of your data plan,\n\n98\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.970\nyou don't want to have to\npay another 15 or 20 bucks,\n\n99\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.370\nwhatever it might be, to add additional\ndata to your plan just to do an update.\n\n100\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.670\nNow I can also do the Custom scan, and\n\n101\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.650\nif I do a Custom scan,\nguys it's no different, same thing.\n\n102\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.520\nI could say every day, I could say week,\nand then if I change it to week,\n\n103\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.720\nI get the ability to choose\nthe day just like we did before.\n\n104\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.920\nSo not really too much difference\nthere as far as that goes.\n\n105\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.680\n>> Yeah Wes,\nthe great thing about this kind of control\n\n106\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.630\nis it really suits all types of users,\nright.\n\n107\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.920\nIf I've just got a standard\nuser that says, well,\n\n108\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.140\nI just need some protection,\nthey can install something like this and\n\n109\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.250\njust let it do its updates and let it\ndo its scanning as it deems necessary.\n\n110\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.970\nBut then if you also have a power user,\nsomeone that knows a little more ins and\n\n111\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.430\nouts about their mobile device and\nthey're into that level of control,\n\n112\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.630\nwell now they have it, right.\n\n113\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.120\nThey can go and\nthey can schedule that scan.\n\n114\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.780\nI don't want you to interrupt\nme while I'm using my phone\n\n115\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.100\nbecause I stay up all hours\nof the night on the weekend,\n\n116\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.850\nand I'm doing things with my phone and\nI don't want it to be interrupted.\n\n117\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.350\nOr I don't wanna update stuff and\n\n118\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.420\nstart taking away CPU cycles from my phone\nwhile I'm trying to do other things.\n\n119\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.680\nSo it's really nice that it fits\nlike a glove for any type of user.\n\n120\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.082\n>> Yeah having that one size\nfits all type of great, so\n\n121\n00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:24.068\nit's the flex fit for your phone.\n\n122\n00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:28.210\n[LAUGH] Now we also have things like, for\ninstance, your spyware that we've talked\n\n123\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.140\nabout, adware, and they just\nabbreviate this PUP or PUP, right?\n\n124\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.760\nThat's potentially unwanted programs,\nand it's good that\n\n125\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.060\nyou can see this right here, it spells it\nout potentially, unwanted programs, and\n\n126\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.530\nthat's just a matter of turning it on and\nturning it off.\n\n127\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.830\nWhat I really like about this is,\nand it's hard to see,\n\n128\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.870\nit says, scan apps that access your data.\n\n129\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.840\nYour private information, right?\n\n130\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.070\nWell, maybe you don't know,\n\n131\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.250\nthere's a lot of communications\nthat goes on in the background.\n\n132\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.460\nHow many of you out there have ever\ndownloaded an app, and if fact,\n\n133\n00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.970\nI just did this a few minutes ago, and\nyou don't check the permissions, right?\n\n134\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.120\nWell, a lot of those permissions\nin there that you just say,\n\n135\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.290\noh okay,\nis reading that private information.\n\n136\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.020\nWell maybe you wanna be aware of that.\n\n137\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.579\nWell, if I'm aware of that\nin the application, so\n\n138\n00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.781\nif I'm aware of that\nin things like adware,\n\n139\n00:07:15.781 --> 00:07:19.651\nit's really good to have that protection\nso it's just not going unnoticed,\n\n140\n00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:23.756\nit's slipping under the radar and before\nyou know it you're exposing a little bit\n\n141\n00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:27.567\nmore of your private information out\nthere, with third party collectors,\n\n142\n00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:31.048\nor things that could be potentially\nused for identity theft as well.\n\n143\n00:07:31.048 --> 00:07:34.809\nNow we also have the ability to\nscan all texts that come in.\n\n144\n00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:40.841\nMultimedia messages, right, we talk about\nURLs coming in from unknown sources,\n\n145\n00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:43.620\nor maybe even known sources, right?\n\n146\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.463\nI'm sure that I don't have to worry about\nDan sending me a text message, right,\n\n147\n00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:49.962\nthat has some kind of URL\nin it that's gonna hijack.\n\n148\n00:07:49.962 --> 00:07:51.712\nBut what happens if Dan lost his phone?\n\n149\n00:07:51.712 --> 00:07:53.462\nWhat if his phone gets stolen, right?\n\n150\n00:07:53.462 --> 00:07:56.827\nSomebody's going through his contacts,\nright, and sees Wes right there,\n\n151\n00:07:56.827 --> 00:07:58.546\nlet me Go ahead and send him something.\n\n152\n00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:02.780\nWell, in that case, I wanna scan all\nincoming text messages, and it uses things\n\n153\n00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.894\nlike reputation services in order to\nfigure out whether that URL is a malicious\n\n154\n00:08:06.894 --> 00:08:11.000\nwebsite, or is one that's known to\npropagate things like phishing scams.\n\n155\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.910\nSo it's good to have that\ntype of protection too.\n\n156\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.870\nNow, the other one that we have,\nscan all files in your internal and\n\n157\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.910\nexternal storage, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.210\nWhen we have something like this,\n\n159\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.960\nit's good to have things like your\nSD card scanned once in awhile.\n\n160\n00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.240\nAnd this is another thing that\nyou'll have to make sure of when you\n\n161\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.705\nwant it to happen, or\nif you even want it to happen.\n\n162\n00:08:32.705 --> 00:08:35.530\nCuz as the SD cards grow and\nget bigger and bigger in size and\n\n163\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.370\nsupport larger sizes, it could take\nawhile for that scan to happen.\n\n164\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.240\nSo whether you want that to happen or\nnot is really up to you.\n\n165\n00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.860\nNow one of the other things that\nwe have is web security here too.\n\n166\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.410\nSo we just back out to the settings\nhere and scroll down a little bit,\n\n167\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.980\nand you'll see web security\nhere in the bottom.\n\n168\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.650\nAnd it say's that it is on.\n\n169\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.860\nNow this doesn't just go for\n\n170\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.310\nwhat we're thinking about on web\nsecurity and visiting websites.\n\n171\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.760\nOne of the things that this also does\nis looks at risky Wi-Fi networks.\n\n172\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.665\nDo you want the scan to go on\nwhen you're sitting at the coffee\n\n173\n00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:15.095\nshop that's got a Wi-Fi hotspot?\n\n174\n00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:18.985\nWell, the chances are I might want\nto avoid those locations, right?\n\n175\n00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:22.085\nOr if, maybe you have connected\nto the Wi-Fi hotspot,\n\n176\n00:09:22.085 --> 00:09:25.530\na lot of times what happens is\nif you've got known networks and\n\n177\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.130\nyou've already connected to them, what if\nyou walk through an area that's maybe your\n\n178\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.820\ncompany is right close\nto that coffee shop?\n\n179\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.680\nWell you can also avoid risky\ntypes of Wi-Fi networks as well.\n\n180\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.920\nYou don't have to worry about it,\nthe say you can surf worry free.\n\n181\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.450\nSo, it's another level of\nprotection that's good to have.\n\n182\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.180\nThe web security side of it, it says surf\nthe web, and again, malicious websites and\n\n183\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.090\nlinks, and if we want,\nas well, Wi-Fi security, too.\n\n184\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.520\nAnd again, it'll warn you if you\nconnect more importantly to, for\n\n185\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.250\ninstance, a Wi-Fi hotspot that\nisn't securely configured, right?\n\n186\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.360\nI've got something old, like WIP Security,\nand I know for the most part,\n\n187\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.300\nwe really don't use it too much anymore.\n\n188\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.790\nBut if somebody hasn't done due\ndiligence on their own wireless network,\n\n189\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.390\na company for say,\nthen you might be at risk.\n\n190\n00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.040\nSo, if it's not password protected,\nthings like this,\n\n191\n00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.490\nit can help protect from that, too.\n\n192\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.650\nSo when it comes to\nthe McAfee Mobile Suite,\n\n193\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.300\nwe've got a lot of options here, Dan.\n\n194\n00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.140\nThe other thing too to keep in mind that,\nlike some of the other ones that you've\n\n195\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.860\nseen, we have the ability to\ndo some in-app purchases.\n\n196\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.750\nIf you want to expand\nthe functionality like, for instance,\n\n197\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.850\nyou can see backups, you need an account.\n\n198\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.960\nIt takes your information,\nbacks it up to the cloud.\n\n199\n00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.570\nIf you do get a virus and you have to wipe\nthe phone, hey, you can turn around and\n\n200\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.930\ninstall that information again.\n\n201\n00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.130\nFind your device, anti-theft.\n\n202\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.140\nWe're not really gonna go too much into\nthat in the antivirus series here, but\n\n203\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.560\nit is good to be able to track and\nlocate your device, lock it, and\n\n204\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.180\ndo a data wipe if you have to,\nif it gets into the wrong hands, or\n\n205\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.480\nat least into somebody else's\nhands that are not your own.\n\n206\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.810\nAlso had the battery optimizer,\nanother good feature too.\n\n207\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.780\nSo you can, Dan, when it comes to it, we\ncan add additional features if we want to,\n\n208\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.610\nbut we get a basic level of protection\nwithout having to pay extra fees.\n\n209\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.350\n>> Yeah, it's really interesting how\nthey add some things that aren't really\n\n210\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.640\nsecurity minded,\nlike the battery optimization thing.\n\n211\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.610\nSo it's like a little cherry on top\nof the cake that says, here you go.\n\n212\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.840\nYou know what, we know that you're\nprobably eating up your battery pretty\n\n213\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.060\nhardcore, especially if you're running\nvirus scans a lot, which may be the case.\n\n214\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.380\nSo they're gonna help you out with that,\noptimize your battery performance.\n\n215\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.270\nThat being said Wes,\nwe also have one more,\n\n216\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.090\nwhich to me seems like\na blast from the past.\n\n217\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.250\nI don't hear this name a whole lot\nanymore at least not in this vein, but\n\n218\n00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.550\nit used to be quite common.\n\n219\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.560\n>> Yeah and that,\nwhat he's alluding to is Norton, right?\n\n220\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.810\nNorton mobile security.\n\n221\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.364\nThey also give us an offering as well that\nwe can, if you have a mobile device and\n\n222\n00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:49.515\nyou wanna protect it, Norton's got\nsome technologies out there too.\n\n223\n00:11:49.515 --> 00:11:52.940\nSo, I've got this pulled up on our screen\ntoo, and we're ready to go with this.\n\n224\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.160\n[LAUGH] You've probably seen, guys.\n\n225\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.410\nAll right, learning from us in an\nanti-malware, anti-virus series here and\n\n226\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.520\nevery time I bring up one\nof these mobile apps,\n\n227\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.870\nit's telling you that my phone's at risk.\n\n228\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.720\nA lot of them do things like\nbest practice analyzing.\n\n229\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.730\nFor instance,\nthe USB debugging is turned on so\n\n230\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.900\nI can connect this device to my\ncomputer and show you guys out there.\n\n231\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.550\nWell, guess what?\n\n232\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.060\nUSB debugging, when it's turned on,\nit's considered a security risk.\n\n233\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.210\nYou've probably seen it when you've\nturned it on before in things like\n\n234\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.460\nthe developer's tool that you\ndo open to yourself, right?\n\n235\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.760\nYou increase your attack surface.\n\n236\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.355\nIt does have the potential to add\nvulnerabilities to the device.\n\n237\n00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:33.275\nSo it's saying, hey, your device is at\nrisk right now, so there is a problem.\n\n238\n00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:36.625\nI'm not too worried about it right now.\n\n239\n00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:40.250\nNow if you want to do scans on your\ndevice here, they make it really easy,\n\n240\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.180\nthey got a nice little Android icon,\nright?\n\n241\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:49.070\nAnd I've got the Android icon,\nI've got AppVisor, if I want to use it,\n\n242\n00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.030\nand we also have your anti-malware option\nhere too, and that's a good thing.\n\n243\n00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.340\nThat's one of the things, I know what's\ngoing on in the background, and I know\n\n244\n00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.730\nthat it's not malware that it's saying\nwhen it says your device is at risk.\n\n245\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.190\nAnd we can see that right here.\n\n246\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.640\nAnd then if I wanted to,\nI could initiate a scan here as well.\n\n247\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.690\nNow speaking of scan, I might want\nto configure how the scans work.\n\n248\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.340\nWell I can do that, and that's the little\nthree bar icon up here for your settings.\n\n249\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.120\nAnd then you can go to App Settings here.\n\n250\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.050\nAnd when you go to apps settings,\nyou've got all kinds of settings.\n\n251\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.950\nYou can see here general\nsettings here as well.\n\n252\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.340\nWe can do on-going notifications\ndisplayed in the security status.\n\n253\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.430\nNow I know there's probably two sides of\n\n254\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.720\nthe tracks on this one because some\npeople might say it's a mobile device.\n\n255\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.530\nI don't wanna have it\nwarning me all the time,\n\n256\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.680\nit's really disruptive, and\nyou might wanna turn this off.\n\n257\n00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.610\nMaybe you're in school,\nmaybe you're going to school and\n\n258\n00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.140\nyou're sitting in an auditorium where\nthey're giving a lecture or something.\n\n259\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.130\nYou don't want these extra\nnotifications going on.\n\n260\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.170\nSome people, and\n\n261\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.170\nsometimes I lean towards this side, say,\nlet me know when something's going on.\n\n262\n00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.240\nI wanna be aware of when I'm attacked so\n\n263\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.340\nI can proactively stop\nwhatever it is that I'm doing.\n\n264\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.170\nOr uninstall an application that\nmight be causing the problem.\n\n265\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.970\nSo you have that ability too.\n\n266\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.150\nNow, most of these apps also have\nthe community watches, right.\n\n267\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.470\nAnd let me be specific,\ncuz this is called Community Watch, and\n\n268\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.080\nit is a Norton technology.\n\n269\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.880\nFor instance, Kaspersky has their\nKaspersky Security Network, right?\n\n270\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.350\nIt is a community of information.\n\n271\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.590\nComes from all different devices so\nthat you can be aware,\n\n272\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.770\nthings like your zero day viruses.\n\n273\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.990\nSo it's basically an online\ndigital protection.\n\n274\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.210\nAnd it reaches out and it communicates\nback and forth, sends statistical\n\n275\n00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.750\ninformation to them, and then pulls down\ninformation based on what they found.\n\n276\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.130\nAnd it's regularly updated.\n\n277\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.540\nWhether you opt into that or\nnot is really up to you.\n\n278\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.450\nNow we also have AppVisor too.\n\n279\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.350\nAnd AppVisor you can see it's\nsomething that you have to set up.\n\n280\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.810\nImagine the ability when you download\nan application from the Google Play Store,\n\n281\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.310\nyou want to know if it's malicious or not.\n\n282\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.590\nOr you want to know if it's\ngot a good reputation.\n\n283\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.420\nWell, I can turn the AppVisor\non if I want as well, and\n\n284\n00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.919\nit'll scan those apps before\nthe installation happens.\n\n285\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.680\nNow as with all or any virus software,\n\n286\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.350\nwe also have the ability\nto set a schedule, right?\n\n287\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.880\nWe tell it when we want it\nto do its schedule, and\n\n288\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.250\nwe've got three options here, and\nthese options you've probably seen before.\n\n289\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.960\nNotice I can turn it off\nif I don't want to scan it.\n\n290\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.870\nDoesn't make much since to have\nan antivirus software on your computer or\n\n291\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.390\nyour mobile device if\nyou're gonna turn it off.\n\n292\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.523\nAnd then you can see the schedule,\nright, daily, weekly, and monthly,\n\n293\n00:15:37.523 --> 00:15:39.330\nand those are pretty self-explanatory.\n\n294\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.040\nNow we also have the scan the SD card.\n\n295\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.504\nThere again, just like it seems to be\na consistency across the board that if you\n\n296\n00:15:47.504 --> 00:15:50.087\nwant to scan the external storage,\nyou can.\n\n297\n00:15:50.087 --> 00:15:54.005\nNow you might say, well why wouldn't\nI want to scan the external storage?\n\n298\n00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:57.712\nThere again it depends on where you\nstore your applications, right?\n\n299\n00:15:57.712 --> 00:16:00.136\nAndroid, as you probably know and\nif you don't,\n\n300\n00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:03.949\ngives you the ability that you can offload\nyour applications from the internal\n\n301\n00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:05.739\nstorage to the external storage, so\n\n302\n00:16:05.739 --> 00:16:10.020\nyou can kinda save some of the resources\nthat are built into the phone by default.\n\n303\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.790\nWhether you scan it or\nnot is really up to you.\n\n304\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.390\nKeep in mind that, if you are one of\nthose ones that has a larger SD card,\n\n305\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.760\nmaybe you wanna carry a little\nbit more music on your phone,\n\n306\n00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.020\nand we're using it like MP3 player or\nwhatever, so we've got a big library.\n\n307\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.960\nYou might want to scan it,\nor maybe you don't.\n\n308\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.220\nAgain, it's an option that you can use,\nwhether you want to use it or not,\n\n309\n00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.750\nit's up to you.\n\n310\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:38.005\nNow the last thing that we have on\nthese settings here is the LiveUpdate.\n\n311\n00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:41.750\nThis is the Norton technology.\n\n312\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.940\nIt doesn't matter if you're talking\nabout Norton from the consumer grade on\n\n313\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.820\na workstation, or even if you're\nimplementing things like your\n\n314\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.920\nNorton enterprise-level security,\nLiveUpdate is LiveUpdate.\n\n315\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.340\nIt's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n316\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:00.620\nIt's updating the application itself as\nwell as the virus definition database.\n\n317\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.470\nKeep in mind, that you do wanna run this.\n\n318\n00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.340\nJust like turning your scans off, if you\ndon't have the current virus definition\n\n319\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:12.300\ndatabase, then your mobile device\nis relatively unprotected,\n\n320\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.680\nand these newer viruses that come along,\nor\n\n321\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.295\nmalware in general,\nyour device isn't gonna recognize it.\n\n322\n00:17:20.295 --> 00:17:23.690\nAnd we've had people tell\n\n323\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.020\nus there's something like hundreds of\nthousands of files are found weekly.\n\n324\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.210\nAnd a lot of them you could have\nthousands of them that are identified as\n\n325\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.330\nactual threats.\n\n326\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.110\nSo you should update this regularly,\nand you have that ability.\n\n327\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:42.290\nNow the other thing that you have the\noption to do too is to monitor activity.\n\n328\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.445\nSo it generates logs, and\nwe can go to the Settings here, and\n\n329\n00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:49.760\nif we want, we can go to Activity Log.\n\n330\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.490\nI can see that the Malware scan ran.\n\n331\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.660\nWe can see LiveUpdate, five updates.\n\n332\n00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.660\nSo you can see just in the time\nthat I've downloaded this.\n\n333\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.420\nIn fact, I didn't download this,\nbut I don't even know,\n\n334\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.720\nabout ten minutes ago to demonstrate it,\nand it already found five updates.\n\n335\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.170\nAnd it can give me the option,\n\n336\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.710\nsome of the basic things that\nare going on in the background,\n\n337\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:14.050\nthe version of the database and stuff,\nAppInsight, reputation database as well.\n\n338\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.490\nSo we can use that too.\n\n339\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.740\n>> Does this only show you update logs, or\n\n340\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.820\nis this everything that\nthe software is doing?\n\n341\n00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.540\n>> Yeah, everything.\n\n342\n00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.070\nSo including things like updates too,\nthat are in the background.\n\n343\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.000\nYeah.\nGood question too.\n\n344\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.130\nNow, we also have the ability\nto do things like, for instance,\n\n345\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.320\nif you want Web Protection, and\nthat's a good thing to have.\n\n346\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.708\nAgain, it's a consistency\nacross the board.\n\n347\n00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:37.295\nYou don't wanna visit a fraudulent\nsite and not be aware of it.\n\n348\n00:18:37.295 --> 00:18:40.755\nIf we're on a workstation,\nit's relatively easy to see that.\n\n349\n00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:45.285\nMost of your major web browsers like\nGoogle's really good at doing this,\n\n350\n00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:48.675\nFirefox is good,\nInternet Explorer does it, Safari does it.\n\n351\n00:18:48.675 --> 00:18:51.085\nWhere if you go to a malicious website,\nwhat happens?\n\n352\n00:18:51.085 --> 00:18:54.595\nThe web browser says\ndon't go to the web site.\n\n353\n00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:56.150\nThrows a little red bar across the top.\n\n354\n00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.310\nIt's not so easy on your mobile devices.\n\n355\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.510\nAnd why is that?\n\n356\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.080\nWell, applications.\n\n357\n00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.600\nHow many applications do you have\nthat are just littered with ads?\n\n358\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.670\nYou don't wanna pay for the device, but\n\n359\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.390\nwhat happens if you click on one of those\nads and it sends you out to a website?\n\n360\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.170\nAnd then that website's been hacked, and\nit redirects you to another website.\n\n361\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.240\nAnd before you know it, you got all\nthese redirections happening on it, and\n\n362\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.250\nnow your device is locked up for\nwhatever reason.\n\n363\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:18.870\nIt's infected.\n\n364\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.840\nSo it is good to know that you have\nprotection from fraudulent sites and\n\n365\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.880\nthings like phishing scams.\n\n366\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.360\nAnd you can see both of the web\nbrowsers by default are protected here.\n\n367\n00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.710\nSo a lot of good features in here,\nit's pretty consistent across the board.\n\n368\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.620\nLike I said,\nI know my device is at risk out here.\n\n369\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.370\nThat's this USB debugging.\n\n370\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.750\nBut it's good to know that it's not\nmalware, and that if I ever need to look\n\n371\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.470\nat that, I can always go into the Settings\nand look at Activity Logs as well.\n\n372\n00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.800\n>> Very, very interesting stuff, Wes.\n\n373\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.310\nObviously we've seen, like you said,\nthere's a bit of consistency across\n\n374\n00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.380\nthe board with the different\ntypes of software.\n\n375\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.830\nIt looks like it's really boiling down to\nwhich software suite you like the best,\n\n376\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.580\nhow it operates, how you interact with it,\nmaybe it's the UI,\n\n377\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.410\nmaybe it's the reporting,\nmaybe it's some sort of control function.\n\n378\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.690\nAnd that's what's gonna lend us to\nchoose one product over the other.\n\n379\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.610\n>> It really is, if you think about it,\nit's like bottled water,\n\n380\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.710\nwhat bottled water do you want?\n\n381\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.351\nI would say soda.\n\n382\n00:20:12.351 --> 00:20:14.440\nThat's probably a little\nmore picky with that one.\n\n383\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:14.998\n>> This is water in there.\n\n384\n00:20:14.998 --> 00:20:16.520\n>> That's right.\n\n385\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.580\nSo that's why I said bottled\nwater cuz water is water.\n\n386\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.790\nSo look at the features and\nthe functionalities,\n\n387\n00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.280\none of the things that I might recommend,\nwhat functionality do you need?\n\n388\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.182\nBecause some of the things that\nmight characterize these software,\n\n389\n00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:36.150\ndifferentiate them, is sometimes one will\noffer more features without having to\n\n390\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.970\npurchase it than another one.\n\n391\n00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.016\nHowever, that doesn't make the other one\nbad, you might end up finding that that\n\n392\n00:20:41.016 --> 00:20:43.091\nother one that you have to\npurchase a little bit of that,\n\n393\n00:20:43.091 --> 00:20:46.024\nactually do a little bit better because\nyou're paying them for that service.\n\n394\n00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:49.528\nSo the service might be a little bit\nmore in-depth, might do deeper scans,\n\n395\n00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:52.740\nmight give you a little bit more\nfunctionality for the cost.\n\n396\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.050\nIt's really up to you.\n\n397\n00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.770\nIf you're on a budget,\nyou can get a basic level protection.\n\n398\n00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.850\nYou don't have to pay for it.\n\n399\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.980\nIf you wanna go farther than that, change\nyour mind later on down the road, and\n\n400\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.740\nyou like the software, you can purchase\nthose extra functionalities, but\n\n401\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.780\nyou really don't have to.\n\n402\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.670\n>> Yeah, something's probably\nbetter than nothing at all, so\n\n403\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:14.270\nfind you a free solution and go with that\nif you have $0 to spend on a solution\n\n404\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:19.515\nto keep you phone and mobile devices\nclean and free of viruses and malware.\n\n405\n00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:23.165\nWes, anything else that we need to leave\nour viewers with before we call it a day?\n\n406\n00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:27.829\n>> Nope, just the consistency that we say,\nif you've got a piece of antimalware\n\n407\n00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:31.799\nsoftware, antivirus software,\nmake sure it's up-to-date.\n\n408\n00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:35.301\nWell, your software can't be aware\nof those viruses if you don't\n\n409\n00:21:35.301 --> 00:21:37.362\nhave the up-to-date definitions.\n\n410\n00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:39.012\n>> Awesome.\nWell, thank you so much for\n\n411\n00:21:39.012 --> 00:21:40.542\nthese explanations, demonstrations,\n\n412\n00:21:40.542 --> 00:21:44.406\nwalking us through these different\nsolutions that are available to us.\n\n413\n00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:46.086\nThank you for watching our show!\n\n414\n00:21:46.086 --> 00:21:47.826\nBut it is time to call it a day,\n\n415\n00:21:47.826 --> 00:21:52.526\nso we will be signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n416\n00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:53.423\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n417\n00:21:53.423 --> 00:21:55.048\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n418\n00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:58.346\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

First they go over Trend Micro's Housecall software which is a stand-alone tool that allows you to run a scan on a computer that is suspected to have a malware problem and then remove any infections found. Also, they check out HiJackThis, another Trend Micro product, which has a robust logging and reporting feature as well as some disinfection ability.",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.230\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we\n\n4\n00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.210\nare going to continue on looking at\nour anti-virus anti-malware series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.620\nAnd joining me in the studio today,\nalso lending his expertise on this very,\n\n6\n00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.410\nvery topic which we love so much, is none\nother than my good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.180\nWes, welcome to the show,\nhow you doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.730\n>> I'm doing great, and as always,\nDan, thanks for having me back here.\n\n9\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.440\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna be getting into.\n\n10\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.620\nWe're gonna be getting into something\nknown as remediation tools.\n\n11\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.647\nWe're gonna be talking about a couple of\nTrend Micro solutions that you can help\n\n12\n00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:46.790\nre-mediate your systems.\n\n13\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.710\nIf you get a virus on them, you need to\nget it off of there, well, guess what?\n\n14\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.870\nWe have some remediation technologies\nwe're going to dive into.\n\n15\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.640\n>> Hold on there, Wes, let's just back\nthis pony up for just one second.\n\n16\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.730\nNow, this whole series has been\nabout antivirus solutions, right?\n\n17\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.290\nI've got an antivirus system on\nmy machine, this is how I run it.\n\n18\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.705\nAnd to keep myself out of the woods,\nwhy in the world would we need to\n\n19\n00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.030\nre-mediate if we are running\nprotection on our system?\n\n20\n00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.690\n>> Some people might not\nbe taking our advice.\n\n21\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.900\nThey might not be watching our show.\n\n22\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.870\nAnd one of the things that\nwe have said over and\n\n23\n00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.890\nover is to make sure that your\nantivirus software is up to date.\n\n24\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.980\nMaybe you don't even have\nantivirus solution on the machine.\n\n25\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.040\nNow that's a little bit rare today because\nmost of them come bundled in with some\n\n26\n00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040\nkind of on-board software,\nat least to give you a basic protection.\n\n27\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.600\nBut there again, if the databases\naren't up to date, you don't know what\n\n28\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.220\nthose viruses are, because\nthe definitions help us to identify them.\n\n29\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.720\nAnd that's where this product\ncalled house call comes in.\n\n30\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.440\nHouse call gives you the ability to do\na really quick scan of your machine and\n\n31\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.060\nyou don't even have to\ninstall the software.\n\n32\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.430\nThat's one of the great things\nabout this house call is that,\n\n33\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.480\nis doesn't even install on the machine.\n\n34\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.460\nIt's an executable.\n\n35\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.420\nIt extracts, it loads up the software,\nyou run it and when you close it down,\n\n36\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.260\nit's kind of like your Lenox live CDs or\nwhen we talk about\n\n37\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.370\nmemory resonate operating systems, right,\neverything is just running out of ram and\n\n38\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.630\nif I shut the machine down,\neverything is discarded.\n\n39\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.230\nWell this is a program that's like that\nand what it does is it runs in RAM\n\n40\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.990\nthe moment you run the scan,\nfinish it, it does it's job.\n\n41\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.720\nShut the application down,\nit's no longer on your machine.\n\n42\n00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.580\nSo that's a good thing in and of itself\nbecause it's not gonna interfere.\n\n43\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360\nLet's say that I did want to\nupdate my anti-virus solution.\n\n44\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.010\nAll right.\n\n45\n00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.570\nDatabase is out of date.\n\n46\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.800\nWell, how can I do that if the virus is\nclosing down things like executables?\n\n47\n00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.660\nViruses do that.\n\n48\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.010\nThey close down legitimate executables\nlike task manager, computer management.\n\n49\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.780\nA lot of times if it's things like\nransom-ware, the only thing that they're\n\n50\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.530\ngonna let you do is launch that\nexecutable call iexplore.exe, right?\n\n51\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.360\nAnd it redirects you out to their website,\nsome bogus website where you have to\n\n52\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.360\nput in your credit card to\nhelp take care of the virus.\n\n53\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.210\nSo a lot of good uses on this.\n\n54\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.100\nNow, when you first open\nup this piece of software,\n\n55\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.170\nlet's go ahead and show you that.\n\n56\n00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.420\nWhen we first open up the software,\nit's going to extract it.\n\n57\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.340\nI went ahead and saved you some time\nwatching the whole extraction process\n\n58\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.450\nbecause the icon is very easy.\n\n59\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.720\nIt's just like any other\nsoftware icon right?\n\n60\n00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.630\nAll you do is launch it.\n\n61\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.440\nOne of the good things is that if\nyou got internet connectivity.\n\n62\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.400\nIt connects outbound to\nTrend Micro servers,\n\n63\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.850\nand it starts doing the component\nupdate immediately.\n\n64\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.190\nSo it doesn't matter with House Call\nif it's a little bit out of date.\n\n65\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.780\nThe moment it launches up, the first\nthing it does is it looks at that virus\n\n66\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.520\ndefinition database and it says,\ngoing to do a component update.\n\n67\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.490\nAnd it connects outbound\nto Trend Micro systems, and\n\n68\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.710\nit pulls all those new virus\ndefinitions and loads them into RAM.\n\n69\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.120\nKeep in mind,\nit doesn't install itself on the machine.\n\n70\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.370\nNow we've got a couple\nof basic options here.\n\n71\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.055\nAnd again, one of the things I really like\nabout the product is it's very simplistic.\n\n72\n00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:58.655\nYou don't have to have a lot of the bells\nand whistles if you want something quick.\n\n73\n00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:02.345\nI need to take care of the product,\nor the virus.\n\n74\n00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.400\nI need to take care of it right now.\n\n75\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.030\nI don't wanna go through the process\nof installing software and\n\n76\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.700\nthat's one of the things\nI like about this.\n\n77\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.980\nNow you'll see right here they talk about\nthe Trend Micro smart protection network\n\n78\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.870\nensures that this service\nprovides the latest protection.\n\n79\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.410\nThat's part of the update that happens.\n\n80\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.390\nThe moment the executable extracts and\n\n81\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.800\nthis software comes up,\nit's already up to date.\n\n82\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.250\nNow you can go in here and\nyou can go in to settings.\n\n83\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.270\nAnd settings right here,\nwe've got a couple of options.\n\n84\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.520\nAnd I'd like to look at these and\nlet you guys see what's going on here.\n\n85\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.200\nNow with the settings, very simplistic.\n\n86\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.280\nThe settings are just\nwhere do you want to scan?\n\n87\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.460\nWhat do you want to scan?\n\n88\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.610\nDo you want to do, like you said in some\nof the previous episodes a quick scan?\n\n89\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.300\nThe common area is where viruses\nare known to be located, right?\n\n90\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.810\nThings like your registry.\n\n91\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.330\nThings like memory,\nrunning processes that are on the machine,\n\n92\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.580\nyour temporary directories.\n\n93\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.610\nMaybe you want a full scan?\n\n94\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.800\nFull scan is pretty obvious there,\nit's gonna scan everything.\n\n95\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.410\nHow about this,\nwhat if you want to customize the scan?\n\n96\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.470\nIf you customize the scan and maybe you\nknow that there's only a single user\n\n97\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.400\nlogged in, you can point it\nto the user profile, right?\n\n98\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.280\nThat's a common location for\nviruses to be as well.\n\n99\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.160\nSo if I wanted to do a full scan,\njust very easy.\n\n100\n00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.100\nAll I have to do is just choose that radio\nbutton and now I can get in here and\n\n101\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.020\nI can say well, let's go ahead and\njust scan the user directory.\n\n102\n00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.610\nMaybe you wanna get\na little more specific.\n\n103\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.860\nI've got a couple of users here,\nUser 1, User 2.\n\n104\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.400\nBut you can see, I can navigate\ndown into the user profile, and\n\n105\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.810\npretty much anywhere in\nthe folder hierarchy.\n\n106\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.530\nAnd if I want to look at something or\nscan something specific, I can.\n\n107\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.950\nNow, next thing that we have are the logs.\n\n108\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.570\nAnd we'll show you a little bit more\nabout the logs here in a second,\n\n109\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.530\nbecause we're gonna go\nahead an test the software.\n\n110\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.655\nWe're going to see, does this\nsoftware do what we need it to do?\n\n111\n00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:55.090\nNow.\n\n112\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.480\nOops and I just closed it.\n\n113\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.560\nNow, this is a good thing to show you.\n\n114\n00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.150\nIt's closed down, launch it back up and\n\n115\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.780\nmaybe I am gonna show you guys\nexactly how to update it.\n\n116\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.910\nIt's fairly fast here.\n\n117\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.840\nYou see it verified the integrity\nof the package itself and\n\n118\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.900\nit connected fairly quickly.\n\n119\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.440\nI do wanna make mention\nof something else here.\n\n120\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.500\nOne of the really good things about this,\nif I'm on a computer that doesn't\n\n121\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.260\nhave the infection, but I know another one\ndoes, it also scans your whole network.\n\n122\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.380\nAnd what it does, is it looks at\nother devices on your network that\n\n123\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.410\nare vulnerable and maybe might even\nbe infected, and it scans those too.\n\n124\n00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.410\nNow we don't want to do that here.\n\n125\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.090\nIf your connected to a network\nthat has a lot of computers on it\n\n126\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.060\nyou could be here awhile.\n\n127\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.060\nSo I'm gonna actually uncheck that.\n\n128\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.450\nIf you're in your home environment,\nremember it's called house call,\n\n129\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.920\nthis is a consumer level product I\nwouldn't uncheck that I would use it.\n\n130\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.942\nThey even warn you here in this if you\nlooked at the little idea thought bubble\n\n131\n00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:53.128\nor whatever, it would tell you only use\nthis if you're on your home network.\n\n132\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.380\nSo I'll tell you what.\n\n133\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.470\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nhow about we do a quick scan?\n\n134\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.660\nNow, I've go that test file over here.\n\n135\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.820\nYou can see that it's there.\n\n136\n00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.020\nNow, if I had my antivirus\nsoftware turned on like I should,\n\n137\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.050\nthat file wouldn't be there.\n\n138\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.430\nIt wouldn't be present, right?\n\n139\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.870\nThe real-time protection would find it.\n\n140\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.840\nAnd it would re-mediate it and\nit would delete it and I'd be okay.\n\n141\n00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.650\nProblem for us, in this demonstration\npurposes, if that happen,\n\n142\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.500\nthen we couldn't even test this product.\n\n143\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.120\nI went ahead and went against the advice\nthat we've been giving you guys and\n\n144\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.510\nI went ahead and\ndisabled Windows Defender here.\n\n145\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.940\n>> So you went against it so\n\n146\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.540\nthat we can show you what who\nhappen if you went against it.\n\n147\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.070\n>> That's right.\n\n148\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.800\nThat's right.\n\n149\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.990\nThat's redundancy for you.\n\n150\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.230\nYou know nothing like, [LAUGH] in\nthe dictionary it says redundancy,\n\n151\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.010\nsee redundancy.\n\n152\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.176\nNow I'm gonna go ahead, since I know\nwhere this virus is, or test file is,\n\n153\n00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:51.695\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nnavigate down to the desktop of this user.\n\n154\n00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:55.507\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ndo a scan just against the desktop.\n\n155\n00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:59.980\nNow we're gonna go ahead, when you set the\nsettings, by the way They're persistent,\n\n156\n00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.135\nwhich is really cool.\n\n157\n00:08:01.135 --> 00:08:04.747\nIf you know where you want to scan and\nyou close the settings down,\n\n158\n00:08:04.747 --> 00:08:08.390\nthe next time you open those settings,\nthey're still there.\n\n159\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.040\nBut do keep that in mind, if you scan\na location, you don't find a virus and\n\n160\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.510\nyou think you might still have one,\n\n161\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.360\nat that point I would probably\njust go ahead and do a full scan.\n\n162\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.190\nAll right.\n\n163\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.379\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll hit Scan Now.\n\n164\n00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.039\nLet me go ahead.\n\n165\n00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:27.890\nNow it's gonna find it and\nI want you guys to see this.\n\n166\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.454\nIt initializes the scan, the scan can take\nawhile if you have a lot of hard drives on\n\n167\n00:08:32.454 --> 00:08:34.688\nthere, a lot of hard drive space.\n\n168\n00:08:34.688 --> 00:08:37.050\nBut you're gonna see\nprobably by the time I get,\n\n169\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.330\nwell it's taking about 11 seconds or\nso here, that it is going to scan\n\n170\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.990\nthe location just like anything else,\nany other oh, and it did find it too.\n\n171\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.170\nSo it found the virus.\n\n172\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.020\nNotice that it says, the risk.\n\n173\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.381\nKeep in mind, like what we've been\ntelling you guys, this is not a virus.\n\n174\n00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:56.290\nThis is just for test purposes.\n\n175\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.780\nIt's a European institute there\nthat creates this so that most, or\n\n176\n00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.585\nif not all, of the virus databases\nthat are this antivirus software will\n\n177\n00:09:05.585 --> 00:09:08.960\nrecognize it testing real time protection.\n\n178\n00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.629\nNow, it's gonna ask us what\nare we wanna do to it?\n\n179\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.562\nWell it also gives you the ability that if\nyou think this might be a false positive,\n\n180\n00:09:16.562 --> 00:09:20.503\nyou're scanning the computer,\nit might find a whole bunch of them.\n\n181\n00:09:20.503 --> 00:09:22.490\nRight, well maybe there's\nsome that I want to ignore.\n\n182\n00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.790\nIn this case I know what this is and\nI don't want to ignore it.\n\n183\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.940\nBut you might, you never know.\n\n184\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.080\nYou might have some software, security\nclass software that is seen by any virus\n\n185\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.400\nsoftware as being malicious when\nyou know it's really benign.\n\n186\n00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.160\nSo that's really up to you.\n\n187\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.188\n>> It's so interesting that a lot\nof system administration tools,\n\n188\n00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:42.110\nnetwork administration tools,\nthey're legitimate things and\n\n189\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.430\nyet hackers use them for\nmalicious purposes.\n\n190\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.520\nAnd therefore they end up getting flagged\nas malicious because the end user probably\n\n191\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.098\nisn't diving into that kind of control\nof their computer, so that anti-virus\n\n192\n00:09:56.098 --> 00:09:58.840\nsoftware is gonna go, you probably don't\nwant that, it's going to flag it for you.\n\n193\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.220\nIf you are an admin, you're going to go,\noh no, no, I need that, don't delete it.\n\n194\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.010\nAnd then you can move onto real viruses.\n\n195\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.740\n>> Yeah like we've talked before,\nlike port scanners right?\n\n196\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.502\nPort scanners I might as an administrator\nwanna do a port scan right?\n\n197\n00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:14.680\nI wanna know what services are running\non my networks, my servers and stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.980\nBut keep in mind,\nattackers also use this as the first part\n\n199\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.122\nof hacking into a system,\ndoing things like fingerprinting right?\n\n200\n00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:23.650\nOS fingerprinting if I could\ntell the ports that are open,\n\n201\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.340\nI can end up finding out\nwhat system you're running.\n\n202\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.400\n>> Or that zombied your computer, and\nit's port scanning for other computers, so\n\n203\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.940\nit can infect and move on, so\n\n204\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.220\nthat's why you'll see it try to,\nthey'll try to remove it for you.\n\n205\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.140\nBut if you're a legitimate admin,\nthen you want something you actually need.\n\n206\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.210\n>> Which is a good point Dan, because\nthat just means you have to be aware of\n\n207\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.610\nthe software that's on the machine.\n\n208\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.735\nAnd typically, if it's an administrator,\nthey're going to know they're\n\n209\n00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:47.380\nprobably tired of having to\nreinstall their security software,\n\n210\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.560\ntheir tools every time they\nrun an anti-virus scan.\n\n211\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.710\nSo let's go ahead and fix this and\nwe'll see what it does.\n\n212\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.630\nI want you pay attention to the upper,\nleft-hand corner.\n\n213\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.636\nYou're going to notice it's magic.\n\n214\n00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:00.250\nAnd it has deleted that file for us.\n\n215\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.310\nNow we can turn around and\nwe can see a few more details.\n\n216\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.120\nRemember the logs that I showed you?\n\n217\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.500\nLet me show you again a couple different\nways that you can get to that.\n\n218\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.817\nIf I want I can go right back\nto the beginning if I want.\n\n219\n00:11:11.817 --> 00:11:13.164\nI can scan it again.\n\n220\n00:11:13.164 --> 00:11:18.009\nBut the more details gives you the ability\nto find out what has been found\n\n221\n00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:19.155\non the machine.\n\n222\n00:11:19.155 --> 00:11:23.484\nI also want you to see that the good\nthing about this is it does call home.\n\n223\n00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:26.700\nAll right,\neven though it's very small footprint,\n\n224\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.100\nit doesn't stay on the computer.\n\n225\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.730\nIt still calls home and\nit looks at their database.\n\n226\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.132\nNow, if I was to look at the test file,\nI could find out information about this.\n\n227\n00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:39.792\nAnd Trend Micro's got, I've actually\nconnected to Trend Micro to find out if\n\n228\n00:11:39.792 --> 00:11:41.680\na file was malicious or not right?\n\n229\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.860\nYou've got 15 of those svhost.exe in your.\n\n230\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.556\nThink you got a virus well you\ncan't just close all of them down\n\n231\n00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:52.123\nbecause unfortunately\nthe operating system needs those.\n\n232\n00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:55.823\nAll right, it seems like\nHouseCall's done its job here and\n\n233\n00:11:55.823 --> 00:11:58.487\nwe do have the ability\nto restore as well and\n\n234\n00:11:58.487 --> 00:12:03.667\nthat's another good point to make if it is\nsomething that it's a false positive and\n\n235\n00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:08.637\nit's not malicious, you can always\nrestore it back to its original location.\n\n236\n00:12:08.637 --> 00:12:12.820\nSo, Dan, HouseCall, for\nthe most part, it does its job,\n\n237\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.950\nit's really quick, it's really fast.\n\n238\n00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.480\nI was actually surprised at\nwhen it did the extraction.\n\n239\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.140\nSometimes the extraction takes\na little bit longer as it's doing its\n\n240\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.830\ncomponent update.\n\n241\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.760\nBut I was actually fairly\nimpressed because 13 seconds or\n\n242\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.790\nso, it had had the current definition\ndatabase and it was ready to go.\n\n243\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:35.490\nSo even things like zero day exploits\nwhere they're not aware of what it is.\n\n244\n00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.980\nIt just seems like they're really\ndoing a good job on that one.\n\n245\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.910\n>> Oh, yeah, pretty straightforward,\npretty cut and dry,\n\n246\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.070\nintuitive user interface.\n\n247\n00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.310\nThat is the things that we look for\nin a product like this.\n\n248\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.090\nMake it easy for me to get rid of\nwhatever I've got a problem with.\n\n249\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.020\nDon't make me have to have a PhD\n\n250\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.540\nin computer science to figure out\nhow to use a piece of software.\n\n251\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.100\nThis is the idea of how\nit should be running.\n\n252\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.030\nSo really nice piece of software and\n\n253\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.815\nit does a really good job\nwith their definitions.\n\n254\n00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:06.170\nTrend Micro is one of the guys out\nthere that you can trust them,\n\n255\n00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.957\nyou know their software is good.\n\n256\n00:13:07.957 --> 00:13:11.959\nYou know that it's going to do a very good\njob of finding just about everything,\n\n257\n00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:12.974\nif not everything,\n\n258\n00:13:12.974 --> 00:13:17.130\nother probably than zero day exploits\nthat they just haven't learned of yet.\n\n259\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.669\n>> Well, you know, that being said, a lot\nof times when zero day exploits are found,\n\n260\n00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:23.268\nyou'll see a stamp on it that says,\nTrend Micro found them.\n\n261\n00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:26.445\nAnd again, you know, not trying\nto get too opinionated here, but\n\n262\n00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.220\nthey are really on top of their game.\n\n263\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.380\nThey do a really good job.\n\n264\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.010\nNow, Dan I'm sure you've\nprobably seen this before.\n\n265\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.360\nWe all use web browsers.\n\n266\n00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.790\nBut with web browsers,\nwe can add extensions right?\n\n267\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.830\nWe've talked about things like malicious\nadd ons in previous episodes just kind of\n\n268\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.700\nin passing conversation.\n\n269\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.600\nBut what is wrong with the add ins?\n\n270\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.610\nAll right, the search providers,\n\n271\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.110\nthe accelerators that you can add\nto things like Internet Explorer.\n\n272\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:58.860\nWell they modify the default\nfunction of the web browser.\n\n273\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.970\nWell if you have a piece of software or\nan extra piece of code that you slip\n\n274\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.410\ninto the browser to enhance\nthe user's experience, right?\n\n275\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.100\nWell that's a good thing,\nall good intentions,\n\n276\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.250\nbut if I've got a piece of code\nthat acts like it's an extension,\n\n277\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.870\nit's an add on to help increase or\ngive me a better experience.\n\n278\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.950\nWhat's to say that a hacker can't\nslip the same code in there?\n\n279\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.020\nSo what is it doing?\n\n280\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.830\nThese are called browser helper objects.\n\n281\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:32.020\nBrowser helper objects, again it's\ntechnical jargon for something that\n\n282\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.320\nhelps to enhance the experience or adds\nto the functionality of the web browser.\n\n283\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.870\nNow unfortunately because any time you\nhave some kind of software hook, right,\n\n284\n00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.130\nwhere you can add extra code and\nit modifies the default nature.\n\n285\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.810\nIf a hacker puts that code in there,\nthey can potentially do what they want,\n\n286\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:55.210\nlike modifying things like registry keys,\ninstalling software.\n\n287\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.580\nIf it happens to be a root\nkit that gets in there,\n\n288\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.010\nnow they have administrative\naccess over the machine.\n\n289\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.090\nSo the next piece of software,\n\n290\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.850\nalso from Trend Micro is\nsomething called Hijack This.\n\n291\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.780\nHijack This is something that helps with,\nnot only the browser helper objects,\n\n292\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.880\nbut also additional things too.\n\n293\n00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.180\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you Hijack This.\n\n294\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.980\nI like the icon, the icon's a little\nguy with a magnifying glass here.\n\n295\n00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.130\nNow when this runs,\n\n296\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.950\nnotice [LAUGH] it's another one of those\nthings, it's very small footprint.\n\n297\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.030\nIt didn't install anything.\n\n298\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.481\nNotice that all I did, download\nthe executable, you click on it and\n\n299\n00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:32.741\nit's ready to go.\n\n300\n00:15:32.741 --> 00:15:36.530\nNow we have a few options\nthat we can use here.\n\n301\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.230\nWe can do a system scan,\nand then turn around and\n\n302\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.960\nsave that information that's\nfound during the scan.\n\n303\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.820\nIf we want, we don't have to\nlog that information either.\n\n304\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.231\nIt's probably a good idea\nto log the information.\n\n305\n00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:53.235\nBut if that's a little bit out of your\nleague and certainly not talking down to\n\n306\n00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:57.055\nanybody, but somebody might not care\nabout the low level information and\n\n307\n00:15:57.055 --> 00:16:00.749\nsays fix it, I don't care about it,\njust make my computer Run better or\n\n308\n00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:02.128\na little more protected.\n\n309\n00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:06.070\nYou don't have to create a log file too.\n\n310\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:11.270\nYou can also open the online\nHighjack QuickStart.\n\n311\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.526\nThey've got extra tools here.\n\n312\n00:16:12.526 --> 00:16:15.968\nWe'll look a little bit at\nthe miscellaneous tools coming up.\n\n313\n00:16:15.968 --> 00:16:19.110\nSo let's go ahead and let's run a scan.\n\n314\n00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.630\nThe first thing I wanna show\nyou is that this also looks for\n\n315\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.230\nthings, not just browser helper objects.\n\n316\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.950\nA lot of the modern browsers today\nare ignoring something known as the host\n\n317\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.260\nfile, right?\n\n318\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.170\nHost file poisoning is another\nthing that we have to worry about.\n\n319\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.630\nWell, what's host file poisoning?\n\n320\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.230\nWell you've got something down\non your Windows machine, and\n\n321\n00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.570\nI believe it's in Linux to, the host file,\nwhere we can do manual name resolution.\n\n322\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.550\nNow we use DNS, and\nDNS is a much better solution,\n\n323\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.780\nit's definitely less\nadministrative effort.\n\n324\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.200\nWe don't use it today, but\nthe files still exist within Windows.\n\n325\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.580\nAnd the problem is some\nmalware gets in there, and\n\n326\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.500\nit slips an address that maps to\nsomething like www.google.com.\n\n327\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.765\nYou're gonna say, wait a second Wes,\nare you saying Google's bad?\n\n328\n00:17:03.765 --> 00:17:06.842\nNot at all, I trust Google,\nI trust the Google website,\n\n329\n00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:09.580\nin fact it's encrypted with SSL.\n\n330\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.215\nBut it's using name resolution\nin the background to\n\n331\n00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:14.015\ntake me to the legitimate site.\n\n332\n00:17:14.015 --> 00:17:17.915\nAnd if the malware can slip\nanother IP address that names or\n\n333\n00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:23.715\nmaps itself to that www.google.com,\nthey can redirect me wherever they want.\n\n334\n00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:28.250\nNow that being said, if you don't\nopen HijackThis with administrative\n\n335\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.440\nlevel privileges, you won't be able\nto clear entries out of there.\n\n336\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.910\nSo, I just wanted to show you that so\n\n337\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.330\nyou know to launch this as\nan administrative account.\n\n338\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.710\nWe're gonna ahead and choose OK to this,\nand we'll get back to the log here\n\n339\n00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.940\nin a second,\nI'll show you guys what that's about.\n\n340\n00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.060\nBut we're gonna go ahead and what we\nwanna do is run this as an administrator.\n\n341\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.679\nNow when we run it as administrator,\n\n342\n00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.900\nnotice that it didn't really give\nme [LAUGH] any kind of problem.\n\n343\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.370\nIt gives me an interface,\nand I can do a scan.\n\n344\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:01.070\nNow, with the scans, these codes,\nright, what do they mean to you?\n\n345\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.310\nWell, they probably mean to you\nabout as much as they mean to me.\n\n346\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.570\nThere's a lot of different codes in here.\n\n347\n00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.360\nCan't figure out what the codes are,\nsome of these are registry entries.\n\n348\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.500\nYou can see some of them are the temporary\nfiles, then the program files.\n\n349\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.460\nBut you don't know what the codes are,\nwell, that's okay.\n\n350\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.320\nThe other thing that we have here is Info.\n\n351\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.407\nWhat I really like about HijackThis is\nif the Os, the O's have a bunch of them.\n\n352\n00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:27.580\nI'll tell you what, we'll start\nwith the registry objects first.\n\n353\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.940\nAll right, what it's gonna do,\n\n354\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.770\nis it's gonna look at things like\nthose browser helper objects.\n\n355\n00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.350\nIf they change a registry functionality\nthat you're not aware of,\n\n356\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:41.500\nyou're modifying the default nature of the\nweb browser and it makes a registry entry.\n\n357\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.410\nWell, is it changed?\n\n358\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.560\nHas it created something?\n\n359\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.170\nHas it added something to the registry\nthat you're not aware of, and\n\n360\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.360\nyou don't even see it in the functionality\nof whatever the add in is?\n\n361\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.870\nWell, all the Rs here,\nwe can actually clear those up too.\n\n362\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.750\nSo don't worry about the fact that if\nyou don't know what the codes are,\n\n363\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.530\nthat's okay.\n\n364\n00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.220\nI don't have these memorized either.\n\n365\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.173\nBut if I need to do a little research,\n\n366\n00:19:04.173 --> 00:19:07.521\nI've got it built right into\nHijackThis that says what is O9?\n\n367\n00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.877\nAll right,\nwell I see O9 isn't just playing bingo,\n\n368\n00:19:10.877 --> 00:19:15.850\nit's actually extra tools and\nit mentions some other stuff here too.\n\n369\n00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.771\nThe other one too, we've got MSIE\nplugins for file extensions and\n\n370\n00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:22.700\nthings like multimedia extension types.\n\n371\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.300\nSo it has a bunch of\ndifferent ones in here.\n\n372\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.100\nAnd don't get caught up in\nthe specifics of each little code here.\n\n373\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.520\nJust know that if you really wanna\nknow a little bit more about\n\n374\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.220\nwhat this information is,\nyou've got it right here on board.\n\n375\n00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.925\nNow if I wanna fix any of these,\nall I have to do is select them.\n\n376\n00:19:39.925 --> 00:19:43.028\nAnd I, the one thing I will say I\nwish they had a Ctrl+A on this,\n\n377\n00:19:43.028 --> 00:19:44.775\n[LAUGH] they do not.\n\n378\n00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:47.785\nSo you're gonna have to click,\nclick, click, click and\n\n379\n00:19:47.785 --> 00:19:49.695\nclick through the whole entire list.\n\n380\n00:19:49.695 --> 00:19:53.645\nBut than what we can do is\nwhatever it finds, right,\n\n381\n00:19:53.645 --> 00:19:56.815\nif it's an entry that's been modified,\nif it's putting information down in\n\n382\n00:19:56.815 --> 00:19:59.445\nthe program files,\nall I have to do is fix check.\n\n383\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.360\nNow one of the things you\nalso have to keep in mind,\n\n384\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.660\nand some of the interaction\nwith the program,\n\n385\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.380\nyou might see that little warning there,\nis like for instance, Winsock.\n\n386\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.545\nIn Windows 7 and beyond, well,\nI think it started in Vista,\n\n387\n00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:17.630\nif security class software,\nsoftware in general,\n\n388\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.276\nwants to interact with a protocol stack,\nit has to do it in a documented means.\n\n389\n00:20:22.276 --> 00:20:24.780\nSo some of them might error out on you.\n\n390\n00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.390\nBut what it does is it removes, it undoes,\n\n391\n00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.510\nall the changes that you see in there,\nso it helps to fix the machine.\n\n392\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.410\nNow, you're not even, might not even\nbe aware that these even exist.\n\n393\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.550\nAnd that's the problem with these BHOs,\nif you will.\n\n394\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.520\nSorry about the acronym,\nbrowser helper objects.\n\n395\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.665\nIt's because you're not aware of them,\nright?\n\n396\n00:20:42.665 --> 00:20:44.745\nYou think that you're getting a map, and\n\n397\n00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:48.325\nmost likely you are getting the ability\nto throw something into a map.\n\n398\n00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:50.555\nOr right click on it and search on Google.\n\n399\n00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:53.465\nThese accelerators are things that we use\nall the time, and they're legitimate,\n\n400\n00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:54.715\nthey're there for a purpose.\n\n401\n00:20:56.235 --> 00:20:58.505\nBut if they are attacked,\nif they are cracked,\n\n402\n00:20:58.505 --> 00:21:02.090\nif there is malicious code in there,\nyou're not gonna be aware of it.\n\n403\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.560\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat HijackThis allows us to do.\n\n404\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.550\nIt allows us to fix our systems and it's\njust as easy as clicking the Scan button,\n\n405\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.780\ngo through the list, and then choose Fix.\n\n406\n00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.920\nYou will see some that are down\nthere in the system locations where,\n\n407\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.160\nlet's see if this one,\nthat one actually fixed it.\n\n408\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.000\nRemember that certain areas of\nWindows can't be messed with.\n\n409\n00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.110\nGoing back to XP, it was called WFP,\nWindows File Protection.\n\n410\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.200\nVista, Windows 7, 8,\n\n411\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.450\n8.1 and Windows 10 all use something\nknown as the Windows Resource Manager.\n\n412\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.655\nWhat does it mean?\n\n413\n00:21:37.655 --> 00:21:39.060\nIt's Windows' way of protecting itself.\n\n414\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.440\nIt looks at crucial files and\n\n415\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.310\nit says you're not gonna be\nable to make any modification.\n\n416\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:47.540\nSo this is another one Dan,\nthat is very easy, very streamlined,\n\n417\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.742\nsimplistic and\nvery efficient in doing its job.\n\n418\n00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:54.530\n>> Yeah, HijackThis has been around for\nquite some time actually.\n\n419\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.840\nAnd if you've spent any time at all inside\nof the forums, especially if you're having\n\n420\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.790\ntrouble remediating a system, you'll\nusually see hey, you run HijackThis on\n\n421\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.180\nthat system and show us the logs,\nwhen you get into a forum type of thread.\n\n422\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.920\nAnd they'll look at the logs\nthat HijackThis creates and\n\n423\n00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.520\nsee where you problem is, help you figure\nout how to get that problem out of there.\n\n424\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.590\nAnd it's cool that HijackThis actually\nhas some tools inside of it, so\n\n425\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.830\nthat it can do some of\nthat business itself.\n\n426\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:26.021\nBut otherwise, you might even be using,\nTrend Micro has others, like HouseCall,\n\n427\n00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:28.230\nor just a antivirus system in general.\n\n428\n00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.270\nI know I like Malwarebytes,\n\n429\n00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.210\nit's always a good product, it does\na great job of remediation as well.\n\n430\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.820\nBut very easy to use,\nand very informative.\n\n431\n00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.595\nThat's what we need,\nin In this type of environment.\n\n432\n00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:39.327\nAnything else we need to know about this,\nWes?\n\n433\n00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:42.346\n>> Yeah, one more thing I'd like to show\nyou guys out there cuz I did mention some\n\n434\n00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:43.146\nof the extra tools.\n\n435\n00:22:43.146 --> 00:22:46.725\nIn fact, Dan just mentioned hey,\nit's got some extra tools built in.\n\n436\n00:22:46.725 --> 00:22:48.089\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you that real quick.\n\n437\n00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:50.240\nOver at the Config it say Other stuff,\nI like it.\n\n438\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.430\nThey just get right to the point,\nOther stuff.\n\n439\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.510\nWhen you go to Configure,\nyou can make configurations here.\n\n440\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.630\nYou can make changes, ignore list,\nthere are exceptions.\n\n441\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.880\nIf you find something in here and\n\n442\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.950\nyou do your research on it, cuz you can\nalso get info on whatever it's found, and\n\n443\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.690\nyou find that it's a legitimate process,\nyou can add it to the ignore list.\n\n444\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.890\nThe other one here is the miscellaneous\ntools that I'd like to show you.\n\n445\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.160\nOh and by the way, right?\n\n446\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.640\nIt fixes the browser\nhijacks right there and\n\n447\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.610\nit shows you that this is pretty\nmuch working in Internet Explorer.\n\n448\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.910\nBut let's go ahead and\ngo to miscellaneous tools real quick.\n\n449\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.150\nAnd you can see some of the other\nstuff that it has in here.\n\n450\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.240\nOpening the hosts file so, for instance,\n\n451\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.410\nmaybe I think I do have some host\nfile poisoning going in here.\n\n452\n00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:37.180\nOne of the great things is\nit shows me my host file.\n\n453\n00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.737\nAnd if I do have other entries, now not\nreally a lesson on the host file, but\n\n454\n00:23:40.737 --> 00:23:43.677\nall of these pound symbols,\nthat means it's commented out,\n\n455\n00:23:43.677 --> 00:23:46.245\nthat means that doesn't\naffect the host file at all.\n\n456\n00:23:46.245 --> 00:23:49.760\nAnd you can see everything past\nthe comments, well there's nothing there.\n\n457\n00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.080\nThat would be the telltale sign that you\nhave some kind of browser hijacking.\n\n458\n00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.700\nNow, the browsers are very good today\nat ignoring the host file because\n\n459\n00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.260\nof host file poisoning attacks.\n\n460\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.270\nSo, for the most part,\nyou shouldn't have to worry about it but\n\n461\n00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.610\nnot everybody is on the latest and\ngreatest.\n\n462\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.090\nWhen we talk about updating\nthings like security patches,\n\n463\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.980\nyou should have your browsers up to date.\n\n464\n00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.365\nSometimes, for compatibility,\npeople stick around with older browsers\n\n465\n00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:16.115\nbecause they got a piece of\nsoftware that interacts with it.\n\n466\n00:24:16.115 --> 00:24:20.567\nAnd it's not really a good thing because\nthose older browsers could absolutely\n\n467\n00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:23.107\nsuffer from some kind\nof browser hijacking.\n\n468\n00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:27.910\nNow I can actually open this in Notepad\ntoo and you can see that it's there.\n\n469\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:33.884\nYou cannot modify it if you don't launch\nthis in an administrative account.\n\n470\n00:24:33.884 --> 00:24:36.531\nOne more thing that I'd\nlike to mention here, and\n\n471\n00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:38.520\nI didn't mention about HouseCall.\n\n472\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.890\nWe have talked about\nmobile technologies too.\n\n473\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.390\nHouseCall also has a mobile technology,\nand I forgot to mention that,\n\n474\n00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.140\nthat was one other thing that\nI wanted to mention too.\n\n475\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.980\nSo if you've got mobile devices and\n\n476\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.570\nyou wanna run a quick scan that you don't\nhave to install a whole bunch of software,\n\n477\n00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.730\nand you have to wait for\nit to connect, set up an account.\n\n478\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.880\nYou need something quick,\nHouseCall Mobile also works too.\n\n479\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.570\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n480\n00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.240\nWell, obviously we have a serious\nset of tools here that A,\n\n481\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.200\nI don't have to install.\n\n482\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.670\nSo if there's any bad thing lurking on\nthe computer that is blocking installation\n\n483\n00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.750\nof remediation software,\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n484\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.520\nThis is a stand alone executable,\n\n485\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.230\nit'll just run when you\ndouble-click the package.\n\n486\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.310\nSo that's nice.\n\n487\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.120\nAnd it's super powerful, reaches out,\ndoes everything that we need it to do\n\n488\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.800\nin case the worst happens and our\nnightmare scenario has come to fruition.\n\n489\n00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.872\nWes, you've walked us through greatly and\nwe really appreciate that.\n\n490\n00:25:28.872 --> 00:25:31.673\nThanks for being on the show,\nlooks like we've come to the end though,\n\n491\n00:25:31.673 --> 00:25:32.817\nI'm looking at that clock.\n\n492\n00:25:32.817 --> 00:25:35.139\nIt has definitely ticked\ndown to the very last tock.\n\n493\n00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:39.185\nSo we're gonna sign of for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n494\n00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:40.125\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n495\n00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:41.418\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n496\n00:25:41.418 --> 00:25:42.725\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.438\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're continuing on our\n\n4\n00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:23.240\nseries with anti-virus and\nanti-malware solutions.\n\n5\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.060\nJoining me yet again in the studio\ntoday is my good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.080\nAnd Wes, how you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.916\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:30.990\nIt's great to be here, Dan,\nand thanks for having me back.\n\n9\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.390\nAnd that's right, we're gonna be looking\nat part two of our remediation tools.\n\n10\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.463\nRemember that some of the reasons\nwe use these tools is that\n\n11\n00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:42.932\nmight be the fact that maybe we didn't use\nour antivirus software the way we should.\n\n12\n00:00:42.932 --> 00:00:43.815\n>> Say it ain't so, Wes!\n\n13\n00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:45.323\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:47.391\nWe didn't update our definitions.\n\n15\n00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:51.430\nOr in this case we're gonna be looking at\na couple of utilities that will help you\n\n16\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.410\nif your machine shuts down and gets into\none of those boot loops where it will not\n\n17\n00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.246\nget to the operating system again.\n\n18\n00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:59.000\nSo your anti-virus\nsoftware can't help you.\n\n19\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.415\nOne of the first moves we're gonna look\nat is known as the Kaspersky Rescue Disk.\n\n20\n00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:06.020\nLet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n21\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.630\nNow, there's a few ways that you can make\none of these Kaspersky Rescue Disks.\n\n22\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.832\nOne of the easiest ways that you can do\nthis, first you go up to Kaspersky and,\n\n23\n00:01:17.832 --> 00:01:22.889\nI got a URL here it's\nsupport.kaspersky.com/viruses/rescuedisk.\n\n24\n00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.278\nIt will give you the ability\nto download it, and\n\n25\n00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:27.207\nit's in what's known as an ISO file.\n\n26\n00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:31.190\nAnd then you can take any kind of\nsoftware, they've got some out there,\n\n27\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.093\nwhat is it ubootin, unetbootin?\n\n28\n00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.000\n>> Unetbootin or unit bootin.\n\n29\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.801\n[LAUGH]\n>> Something like that, yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:36.388\n>> Good luck with that one.\n>> And\n\n31\n00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:40.030\nwe'll make sure that we put the URL in\nthe show notes so you guys can get to it.\n\n32\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.083\nAnd there's other ones\nthere like ISO to USB.\n\n33\n00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:47.789\nIn fact Kaspersky on their website\nmakes one of these utilities, and\n\n34\n00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.770\nit's called rescue2usb.\n\n35\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.840\nSo you can even just have it all bundled\nin if you want, so it's fairly easy.\n\n36\n00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.636\nLike I said,\nwe'll make sure that you get the links.\n\n37\n00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:56.994\nLet's go ahead and take a look at it here.\n\n38\n00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:02.970\nKaspersky Rescue Disk is, I've got it\nloaded in a virtual machine right here.\n\n39\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.936\nWhat it does is you put it on a USB drive.\n\n40\n00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:10.837\nYou can even burn it to a DVD or\na CD if you will, it's not that big.\n\n41\n00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:12.020\n>> Any bootable media.\n\n42\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.480\n>> Yeah, any bootable media, good point.\n\n43\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.790\nYeah, any of the bootable media\nthat you need to load it in.\n\n44\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.610\nNow pay attention to your BIOS.\n\n45\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.610\nIf you're using USB,\nsometimes boot to USB isn't turned on.\n\n46\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.100\nJust take a look at the boot order,\nthe one-time boot menu.\n\n47\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.470\nMake sure that USB is on the list.\n\n48\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.700\nIf it's not on the list,\nthen go into the BIOS configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.070\nFirst of all, make sure it supports it.\n\n50\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.670\nAnd if it does, turn it on.\n\n51\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.903\nNow once it boots up, once it loads up,\n\n52\n00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:37.904\nit's just really nothing\nmore than a Linux distro.\n\n53\n00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:41.180\nIt's a lot like a Linux Live,\nin fact it is a Linux Live CD, and\n\n54\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.900\nit's jut running in RAM.\n\n55\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.053\nAnd that's a good thing,\nbecause the operating system,\n\n56\n00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:50.363\nthe resident operating system on the hard\ndrive doesn't have to be initiated in\n\n57\n00:02:50.363 --> 00:02:53.541\norder to make sure that you can\nget these viruses off here.\n\n58\n00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.866\nNow in order to use this,\n\n59\n00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:58.972\nfairly straightforward like a lot of\nthe other consumer grade products, and\n\n60\n00:02:58.972 --> 00:03:02.713\nlike some of the other remediation\ntools that we looked at in part one.\n\n61\n00:03:02.713 --> 00:03:06.610\nIf you haven't checked that out or\nwatched that, go back and check it out.\n\n62\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.940\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.002\nwe're gonna launch the Kaspersky Rescue\nDisk right here from the Desktop.\n\n64\n00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.396\nNow one of the things\nthat you're gonna see,\n\n65\n00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:17.988\nis that it's telling me down here\nin the lower right-hand corner,\n\n66\n00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:21.530\nmy heads kind of in the way there,\nthat the database is out of date.\n\n67\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.810\nLet me go ahead and shut that down,\nand just launch it back up.\n\n68\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.000\nThe good thing about this, like a lot of\nthe remediation technologies that we have,\n\n69\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.080\nit allows you the ability to update.\n\n70\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.320\nIt's letting you know that\nthe database hasn't been updated yet.\n\n71\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.380\nSo you always want to make sure\nthat you update the database,\n\n72\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.945\nget the current definitions.\n\n73\n00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.332\nThey're downloaded so you'll be aware,\n\n74\n00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:47.051\nthis software will be\naware of the anti-viruses\n\n75\n00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.690\nthat have come out since the last\ntime the database has been updated.\n\n76\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.210\nNow, it's a fairly quick easy scan type.\n\n77\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.120\nYou'll see right here I've got Disk boot\nsectors because we do have problems.\n\n78\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.860\nThink about this, if you're computer\nwon't boot, it keeps looping around,\n\n79\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.700\nit could be an infection down there\nlike a bootloader virus, right?\n\n80\n00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.278\nReally early on in the boot process,\nin fact if it's MBR it's out there on\n\n81\n00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:17.610\nthe first portion of that hard drive,\nand it could be affecting your machine.\n\n82\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.190\nThere's also things like hidden start up\nobjects that you can diagnose as well.\n\n83\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.210\nNow when you scan it,\nfairly easy to do your scan.\n\n84\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.990\nAll you have to do is choose\nthe Start Object Scan, and\n\n85\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.170\nit's going to do exactly that.\n\n86\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.840\nIt's going to run through the locations\nthat you've chosen in order to check for\n\n87\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.010\nthose viruses.\n\n88\n00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.080\nNow we're going to let that\nrun here in the background,\n\n89\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.860\nand I'd like to show you here.\n\n90\n00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.623\nIt lets me know that\nthe database here is obsolete.\n\n91\n00:04:43.623 --> 00:04:50.321\nSo, it's going to try to run through the\nupdate and download that current database.\n\n92\n00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.590\nNow it's going through,\nit's actually fairly quick.\n\n93\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.500\nIt's already gone through its scan.\n\n94\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.270\nDepending on how hard the hard,\nor how big I should say,\n\n95\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.020\nthe hard drive is it could take awhile.\n\n96\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.820\nIf you've got a terabyte drive,\n2 terabyte drive you could be in for\n\n97\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.650\na pretty good long wait there.\n\n98\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.380\nWe also have the quarantine\nsection up here.\n\n99\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.740\nAnd that's up towards the top.\n\n100\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.768\nAnd if it does find\nsomething on your machine,\n\n101\n00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:15.387\nthen it will put it in this location.\n\n102\n00:05:15.387 --> 00:05:19.277\nAnd it will give you the ability to\neither to delete it all the way, or\n\n103\n00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.203\nyou can restore it if you need to.\n\n104\n00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:22.620\nYou can also look at the status.\n\n105\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.752\nAnd again it's telling me that\nthe database needs to be updated, and\n\n106\n00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:27.080\nI can click Update.\n\n107\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.248\nI also have a report.\n\n108\n00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:34.010\nAnd if it scans those locations,\nit turns around and it does find\n\n109\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.090\nan object that needs to be quarantined or\nremediated, it will allow you to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.685\nIf you need to get a detailed report you\ncan get a lot more details there as well.\n\n111\n00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:44.235\nYou could save the report if you need to.\n\n112\n00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:49.385\nKeep in mind that this is a live CD so\nthe moment that I reboot this machine,\n\n113\n00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:52.525\nthat information is no\nlonger gonna be available.\n\n114\n00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:55.825\nSo, do make sure that you take\nthat information off the machine.\n\n115\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.160\nLet's go ahead and close that down.\n\n116\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.640\nNow, you also have some settings\nthat you can configure here, too.\n\n117\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.900\nYour update center, we've talked\na lot about things like heuristics.\n\n118\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.740\nHow sensitive do you want the scan to be?\n\n119\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.740\nAll right, we could say optimal\nprotection, and it says appropriate for\n\n120\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.480\nmost users.\n\n121\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.290\nWe could actually lift this up just\na little bit, and I like this,\n\n122\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.150\nit says, recommended for\na hostile environment.\n\n123\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.930\nSo apparently if you have to worry about,\n\n124\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.610\nat work I guess the wrestling matches,\nthis is perfect for you, maybe not.\n\n125\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.340\nSo you can increase\nthe security level here.\n\n126\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.083\nThe other thing that you can do is set\nwhat do you want, if it finds something,\n\n127\n00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.304\nwhat do you want it to do?\n\n128\n00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:41.667\nWhat is the default action to\ntake these files off of here.\n\n129\n00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.906\nIt says prompt scan is complete.\n\n130\n00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:45.903\nDo you want it to disinfect it?\n\n131\n00:06:45.903 --> 00:06:49.750\nAnd if it disinfects it, quarantines it,\ndo you want it to delete too?\n\n132\n00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.620\nAnd we've got some individual settings\nthat we can configure here too.\n\n133\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.000\nThe objects that we wanna scan,\nwhat objects do we want it to look for?\n\n134\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.410\nWell, it's a good idea\njust to leave all files.\n\n135\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.335\nIf you leave it to all files, then you\ndon't really have to worry about it.\n\n136\n00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:04.530\nYou can scan them by format.\n\n137\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.689\nYou can also scan them by extension.\n\n138\n00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.744\nNow, you also have the ability to\noptimize this a little bit better.\n\n139\n00:07:10.744 --> 00:07:16.281\nSo if you've got these files that,\nit says files scan longer than 30 minutes.\n\n140\n00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:21.160\nWell, maybe I wanna optimize this, and\nI don't want it to scan for a long time.\n\n141\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.098\nIt can also reach into things\nlike archive files and scan that.\n\n142\n00:07:24.098 --> 00:07:27.220\nAnd you can see, by default,\nit is turned on.\n\n143\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.950\nYou can see the packages, no OLE objects.\n\n144\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.850\nI can also choose additional, and\nIt can give me some additional\n\n145\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.820\noptions with file size and do I want\nto unpack large compounded files.\n\n146\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.360\nSo, Dan, with this one here,\nit's relatively easy.\n\n147\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.740\nNotice the scan methods, too.\n\n148\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.695\nThe scan method here is it's\ndoing a signature analysis.\n\n149\n00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:52.898\nAnd that's one of the reasons it's\nimportant to make sure that that database\n\n150\n00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:53.497\nis up to date.\n\n151\n00:07:53.497 --> 00:07:55.422\nBecause if the database isn't up to date,\n\n152\n00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:58.585\nthen this signature analysis isn't\nreally gonna be that effective.\n\n153\n00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:01.282\nIt might find some old viruses,\nbut keep in mind,\n\n154\n00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:04.946\nold viruses typically don't stay\naround too long because, well,\n\n155\n00:08:04.946 --> 00:08:08.992\nif you are in the security industry or\nif you're using security products,\n\n156\n00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:12.895\nthey patch these old viruses up and\nthey relieve the vulnerabilities.\n\n157\n00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:17.461\n>> Wes, it really sounds like your virus\nsolution, regardless of what it may be,\n\n158\n00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:21.279\na standard antivirus solution or\none of these types of softwares,\n\n159\n00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:23.748\nthat it's only as good as its last update.\n\n160\n00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:25.750\n>> Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n161\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.830\nI mean, if you don't have the current\ndefinition database, let's say\n\n162\n00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:36.972\nit's 11/5/2015, right, well ten days\nlater than that there could be 100, 200,\n\n163\n00:08:36.972 --> 00:08:42.400\n1,000 additional threats that have been\nfound by the community industry at large.\n\n164\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.191\nSo you do wanna keep that up to date.\n\n165\n00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.810\nNow, we also have how\nthe heuristics analysis,\n\n166\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.302\nhow sensitive do we want it to be.\n\n167\n00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:54.060\nRemember that you\nincrease the sensitivity,\n\n168\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.740\nyou increase your potential for\nwhat are known as false positives\n\n169\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.920\nwhich means it flags something it\nthinks is a virus when it really isn't.\n\n170\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.519\nHowever, you also have the opposite\nsides of the track there,\n\n171\n00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.690\nif it's too light you might\nget the false negative.\n\n172\n00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.963\nAnd Dan, I think we've talked about\nthis before, I would rather have a false\n\n173\n00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:13.270\npositive and ensure that I am protected,\nthan to have a false negative, right?\n\n174\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.620\n>> Yeah, totally agree.\n\n175\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.514\nMy philosophy on when it comes\nto security through antivirus,\n\n176\n00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:23.362\nantimalware systems is jack that joker\nup to 11 and snatch the knob off of it,\n\n177\n00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.426\nand let it just find everything.\n\n178\n00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:29.706\nAnd then that's kind of our job is to\nbe that reasoning behind it that looks\n\n179\n00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:32.950\nat the data that it's collected for\nus and says, okay,\n\n180\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.100\nthis isn't a bad thing,\nI need to get that out.\n\n181\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.340\nAnd it's gonna take a little time for\nme to go through that and\n\n182\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.610\nfind out what I need to remove so\nthat it doesn't remove it.\n\n183\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.344\nYeah, it's gonna happen, but\n\n184\n00:09:44.344 --> 00:09:49.080\nI'm guaranteed almost that it's\ngonna get all the bad guys.\n\n185\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.890\nI'd hate for the opposite to be true and\nthen lose data or\n\n186\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.230\nbecome compromised in a certain way.\n\n187\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.910\nSo that's my philosophy.\n\n188\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.610\n>> Yeah definitely,\nI would take a false positive any day.\n\n189\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.880\nNow there are a couple other things\nthat we should take a look at.\n\n190\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.060\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this.\n\n191\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.760\nThe update center, again,\nis exactly what it sounds like.\n\n192\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.387\nThe moment you start this software up,\nit's gonna want to connect outbound,\n\n193\n00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:13.570\nit's gonna pull down the brand new\ncomponents, pull down the new definitions.\n\n194\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.010\nNow, we also have some additional settings\nhere that like, for instance, Threats and\n\n195\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.730\nExclusions.\n\n196\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.980\nKeep in mind that you can set exclusions.\n\n197\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.640\nThe other thing that we talk about,\n\n198\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.200\ndetection of the following\ntypes of threats.\n\n199\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.280\nAnd it basically, guys, has all of\nthe malware types, viruses, worms,\n\n200\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.130\nTrojans, auto-dialers as well.\n\n201\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.510\nAnd we could go in here and if we want,\nI really wouldn't uncheck any.\n\n202\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.750\nIn fact, it doesn't, yeah,\nit'll let us uncheck the malicious tools.\n\n203\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.140\nBut thank goodness it doesn't let us\nuncheck things like viruses and worms and\n\n204\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.370\nthen your Trojan programs because\nyou're gonna want those always checked.\n\n205\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.810\nOther miscellaneous categories,\nif you will, and\n\n206\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.220\nthen some of the compressed files.\n\n207\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.392\nSo, fairly straightforward here.\n\n208\n00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:57.990\nAnd then your exclusion\nrules you can also set here.\n\n209\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.300\nFor instance, if you know you have\na location on your machine where you're\n\n210\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.450\nstoring things that could be security\nclass software that could be flagged as\n\n211\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.040\npotential malicious software when it\nreally isn't, I could add that there too.\n\n212\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.890\nSo, fairly straightforward, not too bad.\n\n213\n00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.850\nKaspersky Rescue Disk, keep in mind,\nis one of the good things about this is\n\n214\n00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.240\nthe fact that you can use it for\nsystems that won't start.\n\n215\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.820\nIf systems won't start,\nthen that means the antivirus\n\n216\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.650\nsolution that maybe is out of date on\nthat computer's no longer gonna help you.\n\n217\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.420\nAnd that's the problem.\n\n218\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.108\nIf you wait to update your definitions,\nyou get a virus, that antivirus software\n\n219\n00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:34.540\nis actually useless at that point if it\ngets into one of these boot loops too.\n\n220\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.680\nSo, not too bad.\n\n221\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.280\nKeep in mind that one of the things\nthat you have to do is just have to\n\n222\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.560\ncreate the bootable media.\n\n223\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.030\nWhether it's USB,\nwhether it's an optical drive,\n\n224\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.090\njust make sure that you get your\noptical media, get your USB device.\n\n225\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.564\nAlso keep in mind, that if you are gonna\nuse a USB device, that you download\n\n226\n00:11:53.564 --> 00:11:57.280\nthe appropriate software to take that ISO\nformat and apply it to the USB device.\n\n227\n00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.820\n>> Yeah, very cool stuff.\n\n228\n00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.070\nI'm a huge fan of Kaspersky, they've made\nquite the little follower out of me.\n\n229\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.817\nI've used their software, I love it,\nI know that it finds the majority\n\n230\n00:12:06.817 --> 00:12:09.767\nof viruses, malware out there and\ngets rid of it for me.\n\n231\n00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:14.069\nSo this is something that I would\ndefinitely invest in personally for\n\n232\n00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:16.229\nmyself and, it's free, right?\n\n233\n00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:17.914\n>> That's right, free-\n>> I love that price.\n\n234\n00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:20.430\n>> Free is for me, I definitely like it.\n\n235\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.510\nNow there's another option that we have.\n\n236\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.230\nIf you've ever been in\na Windows environment,\n\n237\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.320\nyou've probably heard of a piece of\nsoftware called Windows Defender.\n\n238\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.740\nWindows Defender has been built into\nthe Windows operating system since\n\n239\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.940\nXP Service Pack 2.\n\n240\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.010\nSo it's been around for\na while, Windows Vista, 7,\n\n241\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.380\n8, 8.1, and even today, Windows 10.\n\n242\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.872\nNow, the next one that I'm gonna show\nyou is essentially what's known as\n\n243\n00:12:44.872 --> 00:12:46.238\nWindows Defender Offline.\n\n244\n00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:47.520\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n245\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.478\nI've actually paused this virtual machine\ncuz I want you to see when it loads\n\n246\n00:12:52.478 --> 00:12:56.600\nup it loads just like a Windows\npre-installation disk.\n\n247\n00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.770\nIf we need to repair our machine or\nif you've ever installed your operating\n\n248\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.420\nsystem, you've probably\nseen this screen before.\n\n249\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.320\nWell, essentially, Windows Defender\nOffline is nothing more than a Win PE disk\n\n250\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.300\nwith Windows Defender on it.\n\n251\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.490\nNow this is also, like the Kaspersky\nRescue Disk, it is one that sits in RAM.\n\n252\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:19.810\nSo you don't have to worry about\ninstalling it you can boot up to it,\n\n253\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.000\nit runs right out of RAM just like\nthe pre-installation environment.\n\n254\n00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.120\nNow, you'll also see that it\nreally doesn't look too much\n\n255\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.930\ndifferent from an installation.\n\n256\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.928\nKeep in mind that what it's gonna do\nis it's gonna install the drivers,\n\n257\n00:13:33.928 --> 00:13:37.875\na basic level of driver so that it\ncan communicate with the file system.\n\n258\n00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:41.995\nAnd then one of the things that its going\nto do is, the moment that it comes online,\n\n259\n00:13:41.995 --> 00:13:44.030\nit starts to initiate in a scan.\n\n260\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.670\nNow when this comes online and\nit does initiate the scan, guys,\n\n261\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.250\nI'm gonna go ahead and stop it.\n\n262\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.930\nLet it run because if you've got\nto this point, chances are you've\n\n263\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.840\ngot to this point cuz you think you got\nsome kinda piece of malware in there.\n\n264\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.240\nSo you go ahead and let it scan and\nlet it run its course.\n\n265\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.760\nI'm gonna go ahead like I said and\nI'm gonna stop this.\n\n266\n00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.198\nNow the only thing that's on this,\nyou have nothing else, if you shut this\n\n267\n00:14:07.198 --> 00:14:12.075\nWindows Defender Offline, if you shut it\ndown, you close out of it, that's it.\n\n268\n00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:14.541\nYou don't have an operating system here so\n\n269\n00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.080\nyou just use it as\na one-time if you need to.\n\n270\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.010\nAnd then remember that when you restart\nyour machine, take the disk out,\n\n271\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.770\ntake the USB device out, you could\nalso do a boot to USB on this as well.\n\n272\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.505\n>> Kind of a, in case of emergency,\nbreak glass kind of idea-\n\n273\n00:14:27.505 --> 00:14:29.470\n>> [LAUGH] That's exactly it.\n\n274\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.584\nSo notice that it, by default, I'll tell\nyou what, since it's doing a quick scan,\n\n275\n00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:39.635\ndepending on how big the hard drive is,\nagain, it could take a while here.\n\n276\n00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:41.381\nBut we'll go ahead and\nlet it run in the background.\n\n277\n00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.575\nNow, we can go to history.\n\n278\n00:14:43.575 --> 00:14:47.440\nThis is really the same thing that you\nsee in the Windows Defender that is\n\n279\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.410\nbuilt into Windows.\n\n280\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.870\nBut keep in mind, the scenario\nhere is Windows isn't booting up.\n\n281\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.510\nSo I need something that can scan\nthat drive even though my native\n\n282\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.910\noperating system isn't running.\n\n283\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.830\n>> This is kinda like,\nwe're using this to bypass the problem.\n\n284\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.900\nAnything that's causing you to not be able\nto load your regular operating system\n\n285\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.700\nis gonna be helpful because it's not being\naffected by whatever that problem is.\n\n286\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.182\nThat's why Wes is showing\nus these products,\n\n287\n00:15:13.182 --> 00:15:17.645\nbecause they don't rely on the operating\nsystem files to become running, right.\n\n288\n00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:20.512\nThey either load into RAM,\nwell actually that's exactly what they do,\n\n289\n00:15:20.512 --> 00:15:23.740\nthey load into the RAM and then they\nrun from there, they're self-contained.\n\n290\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.570\nAnd then they have access to all\nthe other media part of the computer so\n\n291\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.070\nthese things are very, very helpful.\n\n292\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.890\n>> Yeah, and one of the things\nthat differs a little bit from\n\n293\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.305\nWindows Defender,\nthis View Details button down here.\n\n294\n00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:38.035\nIf you're in the Windows Defender\nthat is built\n\n295\n00:15:38.035 --> 00:15:42.635\ninto the operating system it'll have one\nof the user account control shields here.\n\n296\n00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:45.455\nAnd I just want to kind of\nexplain why it's not here.\n\n297\n00:15:45.455 --> 00:15:47.017\nSee, the user account\ncontrol is not functional.\n\n298\n00:15:47.017 --> 00:15:50.735\nThat's a security functionality that's\nbuilt into the operating system and\n\n299\n00:15:50.735 --> 00:15:52.602\nthe operating system isn't running.\n\n300\n00:15:52.602 --> 00:15:54.321\nThe other reasons you might ask,\n\n301\n00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.264\nwell why is the user account control\ngonna stop be from viewing the details?\n\n302\n00:15:58.264 --> 00:16:00.864\nWell that's because the details that you\n\n303\n00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:05.120\ncan see could potentially\ncontain sensitive information.\n\n304\n00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.720\nSo, what they want is a person that's\na local administrator, if you happen\n\n305\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.200\nto be joined to a domain, and you're\nprobably using an Enterprise software.\n\n306\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.250\nBut one of the things, if you happen to\nbe the administrator, they just wanna\n\n307\n00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.830\nmake sure that you are that,\nI should say, you are the administrator.\n\n308\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.640\nAnd it's not just anybody coming\nin here and clicking view details.\n\n309\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.580\nYou could say, oh,\nI see Sally or Bill, the last\n\n310\n00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.390\none that logged into this had a whole\nbunch of things that were taken care of.\n\n311\n00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.560\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n312\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.850\nLet's go back to that history.\n\n313\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.140\nAnd it says View Details.\n\n314\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.720\nAnd there's no details,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n315\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.280\nThat means we don't have\nanything in here to worry about.\n\n316\n00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.740\nNow, you do have some settings.\n\n317\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.910\nAnd with the settings,\nit depends on what you wanna do.\n\n318\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.910\nYou can set exclusions here.\n\n319\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.710\nYou don't get the full functionality.\n\n320\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.410\nYou've got a lot of other options inside\nof the defender that's built into\n\n321\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.700\nthe operating system.\n\n322\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.200\nBut you also have MAPS,\nMicrosoft's Active Protection Service.\n\n323\n00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.640\nThis is another one of those\nreputation services that we've\n\n324\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.240\nbeen talking about, right?\n\n325\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.000\nKaspersky has\nthe Kaspersky Security Network.\n\n326\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.980\nThere's the Norton Community Watch.\n\n327\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.610\nYou've got different\ninformation that's collected.\n\n328\n00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.900\nAnd they ask you if you\nwanna participate in this.\n\n329\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.420\nBut keep in mind it might\nbe a managed system.\n\n330\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.800\nYou might not wanna send them\nany information outbound.\n\n331\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.290\nThat's completely up to you.\n\n332\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.210\nIt really is your choice.\n\n333\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.590\nPersonally, I like to\ncontribute to the community.\n\n334\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.760\nAnd what I mean by that is the more\ninformation they get, anyone\n\n335\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.100\nof the vendor's, we just happen to be in a\nMicrosoft and Windows based product here.\n\n336\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.440\nBut anyone of the vendor's, the more\ninformation they have the more prepared,\n\n337\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.820\nthe quicker they become aware of things\nthat they weren't, the zero day viruses,\n\n338\n00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.910\nor zero day exploits.\n\n339\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.360\nSo, if you want to opt into that you can.\n\n340\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.860\nAnd then the other basic\nsettings here are gonna be just\n\n341\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.320\nnothing more than setting your exclusions.\n\n342\n00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.220\nNow, you can also do\nyour customized scans.\n\n343\n00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.140\nYou'll see quick, full and custom here.\n\n344\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.810\nThe next thing we can do, we can scan now.\n\n345\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.460\nLet me switch that to custom so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n346\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.730\nAgain, basic Windows defender, guys.\n\n347\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.820\nWhat's great about this I\nreally like is the fact that,\n\n348\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.720\nif you haven't used Windows Defender,\nmaybe you're watching right now,\n\n349\n00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.310\nand you've never really\nconfigured Windows Defender,\n\n350\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.370\nwhich is the nice thing about\nhaving Windows Defender, it's free.\n\n351\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.410\nIf you've turned it on,\nit integrates with your Windows Update.\n\n352\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:29.120\nYour definitions are gonna be updated\nwhen it connects to the Windows Update.\n\n353\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:35.230\nBut, if you know how to configure this\nsoftware from this video, you will also\n\n354\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.960\nknow how to configure the defender that\nis in your operating system currently.\n\n355\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.988\nSo, make use of it for sure.\n\n356\n00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:41.700\nAnd I can.\n\n357\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.080\nAnd it finds the hard drives for me.\n\n358\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.410\nIt even finds the users.\n\n359\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.558\nAnd I could, maybe I've got a specific\nuser that I want to check their profile.\n\n360\n00:18:51.558 --> 00:18:53.960\nWell, I could tell it,\nyou know what, go ahead and\n\n361\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:59.100\njust scan that user's profile as just\nthat profile, or just that location.\n\n362\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.300\nAnd it could speed up the time.\n\n363\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.740\nNow, again, it's not always that clear\nwhere the virus might be or the malware.\n\n364\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.070\nAnd they definitely like to replicate\nthemselves all over the place.\n\n365\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.130\nSo, if you use the custom scan that's,\nagain, gonna be up to you.\n\n366\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.500\nSo, again, a couple of really,\nreally good utilities that we have.\n\n367\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.010\nIf a system will not get started up\nyou need to try to remediate it.\n\n368\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:25.490\nYou need to quarantine these files,\nand you need to get rid of them.\n\n369\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.025\nYou can.\n\n370\n00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:31.360\nNow, another thing I would also keep\nin mind is that if you are using this\n\n371\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:37.230\nsoftware, the moment you get done using\nthe software can boot the computer.\n\n372\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.910\nI would do a local scan of any\nthe software that you might be using.\n\n373\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.280\nDoesn't matter what vendor it is.\n\n374\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.840\nIf if happens to be Kaspersky, like Dan\nsaid, Dan likes Kaspesrky, I would turn\n\n375\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.800\naround and recommend the moment you can\nboot the computer run another virus scan.\n\n376\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.370\nMake sure you update your database,\n\n377\n00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.270\ncuz it very well could be the thing that\ngot you in trouble in the first place.\n\n378\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:03.420\nSo, the first thing you do, keep that\nsecurity update or the software updated.\n\n379\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.780\nKeep your systems patched.\n\n380\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.690\nRight?\nIt could be a security vulnerability that\n\n381\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.060\njust happened because there's an exploit\nthat isn't patched in the system.\n\n382\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.770\nIt's another thing with\nthe Windows update, specifically.\n\n383\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.780\nIf you update Windows,\nit'll update those security definitions.\n\n384\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.010\nAnd I say, Dan, one of things I like is\nset it, forget it, walk away from it.\n\n385\n00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.350\nYou know that it's gonna be up-to-date,\nand that's a really good thing.\n\n386\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.405\n>> Yes.\nExcellent, wise words by Mr.\n\n387\n00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:27.560\nWesmeyer here.\n\n388\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.330\nListen to what he's saying because\nhe's absolutely 100% right.\n\n389\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:36.510\nEven if you've run a virus scan using\none of these bootable type of scanners,\n\n390\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.820\nstill, once you get things fixed,\nmake sure they're fixed.\n\n391\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.130\nRun another scan with an updated version\nof whatever it is you're running.\n\n392\n00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.760\nIf you weren't running any anti-virus,\nwell, hopefully, that was lesson learned.\n\n393\n00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.590\nAnd you, thank goodness,\nhopefully avoided a problem.\n\n394\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.060\nAnd now, you're gonna get\nan anti-virus software suite.\n\n395\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.120\nPlenty of them out there.\n\n396\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.860\nWe've gone over tons of\nthem in this series alone.\n\n397\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.260\nSo, pick one you like.\n\n398\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.710\nUse it and keep it updated.\n\n399\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.240\nKeep your software updated.\n\n400\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.550\nThat's gonna keep you out of the weeds and\nthat's what we want for you.\n\n401\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.510\nSo, the whole reason we're\nhere doing this series.\n\n402\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.000\nWes, is there any parting words of\nwisdom we have for our viewers?\n\n403\n00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.690\n>> No.\nI think you've covered it, Dan.\n\n404\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.860\nIt's the updates.\n\n405\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.810\nWe always end on the updates.\n\n406\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.470\nIt does not make sense to download\nsecurity software and not have the most\n\n407\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.840\ncurrent technology, or the current\ncomponents inside of that software.\n\n408\n00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.705\nBecause at that point you might as well\nbe using an anti-virus software from '92.\n\n409\n00:21:26.705 --> 00:21:28.387\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or whatever you know.\n\n410\n00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:29.120\n>> That's right.\n\n411\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.248\nYeah.\nAll right, Wes.\n\n412\n00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:31.602\nWell, thank you so much.\n\n413\n00:21:31.602 --> 00:21:33.420\nAnd thank you for joining us.\n\n414\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.900\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n415\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.360\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n416\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.220\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n417\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.278\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n418\n00:21:39.278 --> 00:21:40.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
