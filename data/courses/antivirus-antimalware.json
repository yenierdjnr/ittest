We look at the consumer class antivirus software, some of the major components inside it and demonstrate some of the common antivirus software one might encounter in a home network or small home business. We will also venture into antivirus software that scales to large businesses via enterprise-class software. This series will help a technician or newcomer understand why they might need anti-malware and antivirus solutions and the difference between consumer class and enterprise class antivirus software.",
