All right, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.770\nin this series we're gonna be taking\na look at Apple technologies from\n\n6\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.330\nthe perspective of somebody who\nhas to work with them everyday.\n\n7\n00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.940\nThis is designed as a kind of a first\nstep in your Apple certification career.\n\n8\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.960\nSo we cover a lot basics\nthat are spread across.\n\n9\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.770\nHow to use our Mac OS environment.\n\n10\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.980\nHow to support computer\nsystems running Mac.\n\n11\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.980\nAnd to be thinking about various things\nlike security initiatives and so on.\n\n12\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.800\nAs we step through this course\nyou are gonna see it covers quite\n\n13\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.650\na range of material.\n\n14\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.000\nProbably more than what\na regular end use would need.\n\n15\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.080\nBut it's geared more towards that IT\nprofessional, somebody who is gonna be\n\n16\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.350\nworking with these systems, and\nneeds to know the ins and outs a little\n\n17\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.070\nbetter than the regular end user.\n&gt;&gt; So you've already touched on this, but\n\n18\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.780\nwho else is the show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this is\n\n19\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.010\nreally targeted towards businesses, people\nwho support Macs, that's kinda what I\n\n20\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.930\nmentioned a moment ago but I said\nit's a little more than an end user.\n\n21\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.690\nHonestly end users can benefit from\na lot of this knowledge as well.\n\n22\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.330\nIt'll help you better understand how to\nuse your Mac and some of the features that\n\n23\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.990\nare tucked behind the scenes that most\nof us don't necessarily think about.\n\n24\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.590\nBut the reality is this course\nit used to have a name,\n\n25\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.030\nApple used to call this\nMac Integration Basics.\n\n26\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.460\nAnd when it was called Mac Integration\nBasics, it was focused on teaching you\n\n27\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.100\nhow to integrate your Mac with\na Microsoft Windows environment.\n\n28\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.190\nAnd so if you work in a business where\nyou had Mac and Windows machines and\n\n29\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.560\nthey needed to work together,\nthis was the course view.\n\n30\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.900\nOver the years it's changed a lot.\n\n31\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.880\nIt is still called Mac Integration Basics\non some pages, but\n\n32\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.650\nit's really\nthe Apple Certified Associate now.\n\n33\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.480\nAnd it's focused on anybody who support\nMacs in a business environment or\n\n34\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.500\nis using them in any kind of professional\nsense to make sure that they are stable,\n\n35\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.060\nsecure and up and running.\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification\n\n36\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.380\ninvolved in the course?\n\n37\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.940\nAbsolutely.\nSo\n\n38\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.380\nthat's where we get the confusion, right?\n\n39\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.990\nBecause it used to be Mac Integration\nBasics, and it was just a course.\n\n40\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.560\nThen they added the certification,\nthe Apple Certified Associate, or ACA.\n\n41\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.640\nAnd now, well,\n\n42\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.620\nthere actually used to be more than\none course that could get your ACA.\n\n43\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.140\nThis is now the only\ncourse that gets your ACA.\n\n44\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.150\n&gt;&gt; So they merged the two together.\n\n45\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.000\nSo it used to be kinda this\noptional component but\n\n46\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.100\nnow it's all stuck together and\nit's one and the same.\n\n47\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.710\nSo when you hear somebody say\nMac integration basics and\n\n48\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.570\nyou hear somebody say Apple Certified\nAssociate, those are one and the same.\n\n49\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.030\nSo what we're gonna learn\nhere in this series,\n\n50\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.500\nwe're gonna cover all the exam objectives.\n\n51\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.860\nTo make sure that you have the knowledge\nin your noggin to be able to sit down,\n\n52\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.430\ntake the exam and get ACA certified.\n\n53\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.950\nAnd I mentioned earlier that's\nkind of that first step\n\n54\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.500\nin the Apple Certification Program.\n\n55\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.190\nSomebody might choose to continue on to\ndo Apple Certified Support Professional,\n\n56\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.210\nsomebody may stop right here at ACA.\n\n57\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.930\nIt's actually a nice cert to be able\nto get because it doesn't have a ton of\n\n58\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.030\ninformation behind it, so\nit's easy to grasp all the data,\n\n59\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.140\nget that certification and\nget that thrown in your resume.\n\n60\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.340\nAnd then you can always choose to\nmove more advanced down the road.\n\n61\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.040\n&gt;&gt; So what sort of episodic topics are we\n\n62\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.350\ngonna be covering?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n63\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.470\nwe're gonna jump all over the place.\n\n64\n00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.030\nThere is still some integration with\nWindows that is part of this exam.\n\n65\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.070\nAnd that's actually what we're gonna\nstart with, directory services.\n\n66\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.800\nConnecting a Mac to a Microsoft\nactive directory environment.\n\n67\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.152\nThose are very prevalent out\nthere in the business world,\n\n68\n00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:14.978\nalmost non existent in the home,\nall right.\n\n69\n00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:18.090\nThat's an example of where home users\ndon't necessarily benefit from this.\n\n70\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.040\nBut in the business world,\nthey are everywhere.\n\n71\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.860\nSo we'll get a chance\nto see how that works.\n\n72\n00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.690\nWe're gonna take a look at file sharing.\n\n73\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.010\nWe can share files across the network and\nget our Macs talking.\n\n74\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.670\nWe'll do email, contacts, and\ncalendar or collaboration software.\n\n75\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.630\nSo if you're in a business environment,\n\n76\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.470\nyou likely have some kind\nof centralized mail system.\n\n77\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.480\nMaybe calendaring, maybe contacts.\n\n78\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.420\nWe can integrate all of that right\ninto Mac OS using the mail, calendar,\n\n79\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.280\nand contacts apps.\n\n80\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.550\nWhich are appropriately named for\nwhat they do.\n\n81\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n82\n00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:47.498\n&gt;&gt; So we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n83\n00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.435\nWe're gonna dabble into security and\n\n84\n00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:52.660\nsome of the security features\nthat are built into Mac OS.\n\n85\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.110\nWhich are on by default,\nsome which aren't.\n\n86\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.070\nSo we'll get the chance to see which\nare which and how to work with those.\n\n87\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.680\nWe'll do printing, because well,\npeople still print and we need to\n\n88\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.529\n&gt;&gt; Do you think it's good?\n\n89\n00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.523\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Businesses especially,\n\n90\n00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:04.950\nprinting is really important.\n\n91\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.375\nWe're going to tackle backing up content.\n\n92\n00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:08.064\nTime Machine.\n\n93\n00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.400\nTime Machine is really easy.\n\n94\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.450\nFor a home user, it's easy to forget.\n\n95\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940\nFor a business user, it's essential.\n\n96\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.860\nWe need to make sure that\nwe back up our system.\n\n97\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.840\nSo we'll see how to back it up,\nhow to restore,\n\n98\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.000\nhow to make sure that our data\nis there when we need it.\n\n99\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.960\nAnd if we do have a failure,\nthat we can recover from it.\n\n100\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.130\nAnd the last thing that we're gonna\ntackle is kind of a fun one for\n\n101\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.940\nme, which is if you're moving from\nthe Windows world over to Mac OS,\n\n102\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.490\nsometimes there's applications\nthat still require Windows.\n\n103\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.270\nWell, we're gonna see how you can run\nthose Windows applications on your Mac.\n\n104\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.690\nWe'll see virtualization\nsoftware like VMware Fusion.\n\n105\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.530\nAnd we'll take a look at Boot Camp where\nyou can actually install Microsoft Windows\n\n106\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.010\non your Mac and have it run side-by-side\nwith MacOS so that when you boot up you\n\n107\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.020\ncan pick, do I wanna boot up into MacOS or\ndo I wanna boot up into Microsoft Windows?\n\n108\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.020\nAnd you still have access\nto those applications.\n\n109\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.970\nReally neat features, and we're gonna see\nthem all right throughout this series in\n\n110\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.250\nApple Certified Associates.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Don.\n\n111\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.540\nSo if Apple Certified Associates sounds\nlike a course you'd be interested in, and\n\n112\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.880\nyou should be interested in it,\n\n113\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.670\nmake sure you see all the episodes\nfrom our course library.\n\n114\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.858\nAnd thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n115\n00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.771\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
