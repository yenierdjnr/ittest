All right, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.770\nin this series we're gonna be taking\na look at Apple technologies from\n\n6\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.330\nthe perspective of somebody who\nhas to work with them everyday.\n\n7\n00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.940\nThis is designed as a kind of a first\nstep in your Apple certification career.\n\n8\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.960\nSo we cover a lot basics\nthat are spread across.\n\n9\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.770\nHow to use our Mac OS environment.\n\n10\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.980\nHow to support computer\nsystems running Mac.\n\n11\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.980\nAnd to be thinking about various things\nlike security initiatives and so on.\n\n12\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.800\nAs we step through this course\nyou are gonna see it covers quite\n\n13\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.650\na range of material.\n\n14\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.000\nProbably more than what\na regular end use would need.\n\n15\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.080\nBut it's geared more towards that IT\nprofessional, somebody who is gonna be\n\n16\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.350\nworking with these systems, and\nneeds to know the ins and outs a little\n\n17\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.070\nbetter than the regular end user.\n&gt;&gt; So you've already touched on this, but\n\n18\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.780\nwho else is the show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this is\n\n19\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.010\nreally targeted towards businesses, people\nwho support Macs, that's kinda what I\n\n20\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.930\nmentioned a moment ago but I said\nit's a little more than an end user.\n\n21\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.690\nHonestly end users can benefit from\na lot of this knowledge as well.\n\n22\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.330\nIt'll help you better understand how to\nuse your Mac and some of the features that\n\n23\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.990\nare tucked behind the scenes that most\nof us don't necessarily think about.\n\n24\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.590\nBut the reality is this course\nit used to have a name,\n\n25\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.030\nApple used to call this\nMac Integration Basics.\n\n26\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.460\nAnd when it was called Mac Integration\nBasics, it was focused on teaching you\n\n27\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.100\nhow to integrate your Mac with\na Microsoft Windows environment.\n\n28\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.190\nAnd so if you work in a business where\nyou had Mac and Windows machines and\n\n29\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.560\nthey needed to work together,\nthis was the course view.\n\n30\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.900\nOver the years it's changed a lot.\n\n31\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.880\nIt is still called Mac Integration Basics\non some pages, but\n\n32\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.650\nit's really\nthe Apple Certified Associate now.\n\n33\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.480\nAnd it's focused on anybody who support\nMacs in a business environment or\n\n34\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.500\nis using them in any kind of professional\nsense to make sure that they are stable,\n\n35\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.060\nsecure and up and running.\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification\n\n36\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.380\ninvolved in the course?\n\n37\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.940\nAbsolutely.\nSo\n\n38\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.380\nthat's where we get the confusion, right?\n\n39\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.990\nBecause it used to be Mac Integration\nBasics, and it was just a course.\n\n40\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.560\nThen they added the certification,\nthe Apple Certified Associate, or ACA.\n\n41\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.640\nAnd now, well,\n\n42\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.620\nthere actually used to be more than\none course that could get your ACA.\n\n43\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.140\nThis is now the only\ncourse that gets your ACA.\n\n44\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.150\n&gt;&gt; So they merged the two together.\n\n45\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.000\nSo it used to be kinda this\noptional component but\n\n46\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.100\nnow it's all stuck together and\nit's one and the same.\n\n47\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.710\nSo when you hear somebody say\nMac integration basics and\n\n48\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.570\nyou hear somebody say Apple Certified\nAssociate, those are one and the same.\n\n49\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.030\nSo what we're gonna learn\nhere in this series,\n\n50\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.500\nwe're gonna cover all the exam objectives.\n\n51\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.860\nTo make sure that you have the knowledge\nin your noggin to be able to sit down,\n\n52\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.430\ntake the exam and get ACA certified.\n\n53\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.950\nAnd I mentioned earlier that's\nkind of that first step\n\n54\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.500\nin the Apple Certification Program.\n\n55\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.190\nSomebody might choose to continue on to\ndo Apple Certified Support Professional,\n\n56\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.210\nsomebody may stop right here at ACA.\n\n57\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.930\nIt's actually a nice cert to be able\nto get because it doesn't have a ton of\n\n58\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.030\ninformation behind it, so\nit's easy to grasp all the data,\n\n59\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.140\nget that certification and\nget that thrown in your resume.\n\n60\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.340\nAnd then you can always choose to\nmove more advanced down the road.\n\n61\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.040\n&gt;&gt; So what sort of episodic topics are we\n\n62\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.350\ngonna be covering?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n63\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.470\nwe're gonna jump all over the place.\n\n64\n00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.030\nThere is still some integration with\nWindows that is part of this exam.\n\n65\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.070\nAnd that's actually what we're gonna\nstart with, directory services.\n\n66\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.800\nConnecting a Mac to a Microsoft\nactive directory environment.\n\n67\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.152\nThose are very prevalent out\nthere in the business world,\n\n68\n00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:14.978\nalmost non existent in the home,\nall right.\n\n69\n00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:18.090\nThat's an example of where home users\ndon't necessarily benefit from this.\n\n70\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.040\nBut in the business world,\nthey are everywhere.\n\n71\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.860\nSo we'll get a chance\nto see how that works.\n\n72\n00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.690\nWe're gonna take a look at file sharing.\n\n73\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.010\nWe can share files across the network and\nget our Macs talking.\n\n74\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.670\nWe'll do email, contacts, and\ncalendar or collaboration software.\n\n75\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.630\nSo if you're in a business environment,\n\n76\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.470\nyou likely have some kind\nof centralized mail system.\n\n77\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.480\nMaybe calendaring, maybe contacts.\n\n78\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.420\nWe can integrate all of that right\ninto Mac OS using the mail, calendar,\n\n79\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.280\nand contacts apps.\n\n80\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.550\nWhich are appropriately named for\nwhat they do.\n\n81\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n82\n00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:47.498\n&gt;&gt; So we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n83\n00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.435\nWe're gonna dabble into security and\n\n84\n00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:52.660\nsome of the security features\nthat are built into Mac OS.\n\n85\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.110\nWhich are on by default,\nsome which aren't.\n\n86\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.070\nSo we'll get the chance to see which\nare which and how to work with those.\n\n87\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.680\nWe'll do printing, because well,\npeople still print and we need to\n\n88\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.529\n&gt;&gt; Do you think it's good?\n\n89\n00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.523\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Businesses especially,\n\n90\n00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:04.950\nprinting is really important.\n\n91\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.375\nWe're going to tackle backing up content.\n\n92\n00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:08.064\nTime Machine.\n\n93\n00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.400\nTime Machine is really easy.\n\n94\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.450\nFor a home user, it's easy to forget.\n\n95\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940\nFor a business user, it's essential.\n\n96\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.860\nWe need to make sure that\nwe back up our system.\n\n97\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.840\nSo we'll see how to back it up,\nhow to restore,\n\n98\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.000\nhow to make sure that our data\nis there when we need it.\n\n99\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.960\nAnd if we do have a failure,\nthat we can recover from it.\n\n100\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.130\nAnd the last thing that we're gonna\ntackle is kind of a fun one for\n\n101\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.940\nme, which is if you're moving from\nthe Windows world over to Mac OS,\n\n102\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.490\nsometimes there's applications\nthat still require Windows.\n\n103\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.270\nWell, we're gonna see how you can run\nthose Windows applications on your Mac.\n\n104\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.690\nWe'll see virtualization\nsoftware like VMware Fusion.\n\n105\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.530\nAnd we'll take a look at Boot Camp where\nyou can actually install Microsoft Windows\n\n106\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.010\non your Mac and have it run side-by-side\nwith MacOS so that when you boot up you\n\n107\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.020\ncan pick, do I wanna boot up into MacOS or\ndo I wanna boot up into Microsoft Windows?\n\n108\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.020\nAnd you still have access\nto those applications.\n\n109\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.970\nReally neat features, and we're gonna see\nthem all right throughout this series in\n\n110\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.250\nApple Certified Associates.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Don.\n\n111\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.540\nSo if Apple Certified Associates sounds\nlike a course you'd be interested in, and\n\n112\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.880\nyou should be interested in it,\n\n113\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.670\nmake sure you see all the episodes\nfrom our course library.\n\n114\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.858\nAnd thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n115\n00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.771\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

directory\nservices in this episode.\n\n11\n00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.980\nSo what is directory services all about?\n\n12\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.670\nWell, we know a guy who knows everything.\n\n13\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.460\nIt's [LAUGH] Don Pezet who's\ngonna tell us all about\n\n14\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.990\nit, aren't you Don?\n&gt;&gt; Said these lofty

right.\n\n17\n00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.220\nI don't know about everything, but\nI do know about directory services and\n\n18\n00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.350\nthat is exactly what we're gonna be\ntalking about here in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.810\nOne thing that you've probably encountered\nif you work in a business environment\n\n20\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.460\nis that managing user accounts\ncan be a bit of a nightmare,\n\n21\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.220\nthat every computer maintains\ntheir own set of user accounts.\n\n22\n00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.220\nSo, if I create a user account called\nDon Pezet on my laptop, and I create\n\n23\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.680\na user account called Don Pezet on Zach's\nlaptop, now, I can log in on both.\n\n24\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.940\nBut if I change my password on one,\nit's not changed on the other, is it?\n\n25\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.933\nI would have to go and\nchange it there, too.\n\n26\n00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:12.480\nAnd if we buy a third computer, I've got\nto go and create an account there as well.\n\n27\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.520\nWell, at small scale, you can do that.\n\n28\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.200\nLike home users.\n\n29\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.020\nThey do that oftentimes, right?\n\n30\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.990\nBut at a large scale,\nthat doesn't work out so well.\n\n31\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.320\nIf I have a thousand computers and\n\n32\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.860\nI wanted Zach to be able to log in to\nany of them, I would have to go and\n\n33\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.340\ncreate an account on all 1,000 computers,\nand that's crazy talk.\n\n34\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.270\nAnd by the time it's done, Zach will say,\nwell, I wanna change my password.\n\n35\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.480\nAnd I'll say, absolutely not.\n\n36\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.967\nWe'd have to go and\nchange it on 1,000 machines.\n\n37\n00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.290\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n38\n00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.550\nDirectory services solved that problem.\n\n39\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.080\nDirectory services let us have a\ncentralized database of user accounts, so\n\n40\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.710\nyou create the user account one time.\n\n41\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.548\nYou assign a password one time.\n\n42\n00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:53.468\nIf someone wants to change a password,\nthey change it one time,\n\n43\n00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:57.130\nand it automatically takes effect across\nall the machines in your network.\n\n44\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.720\nWhether you have 5 or 5,000 or 50,000,\nit all takes effect in one fell swoop.\n\n45\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.040\nSo directory services are really,\nreally powerful for\n\n46\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.100\nbusinesses and enterprise,\nnot for end users.\n\n47\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.370\nSo a lot of people who watch this show\nare people who are coming from an end\n\n48\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.960\nuser background.\n\n49\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.990\nLike hey, I'm a Mac user.\n\n50\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.697\nI've used them for 20 years.\n\n51\n00:02:15.697 --> 00:02:16.574\nI love Mac OS.\n\n52\n00:02:16.574 --> 00:02:17.811\nI know everything about it.\n\n53\n00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:19.484\nBut if you haven't worked in\nan enterprise environment,\n\n54\n00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:21.510\nyou probably haven't dealt\nwith a directory service.\n\n55\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.570\nWe're gonna see them right here\nin this episode, how they work,\n\n56\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.690\nhow we get connected to them, and how we\ncan take advantage of that service and\n\n57\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.100\nmake it available to our users and really\nmake our support of Mac OS even better.\n\n58\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.970\n&gt;&gt; So Don, you've already touched on it,\n\n59\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.570\nbut why would we use a directory\nservice as opposed to local accounts?\n\n60\n00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.149\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n61\n00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.950\nSo there's kinda two\ndifferent arguments here for\n\n62\n00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.976\nwhy we'd go one way versus another.\n\n63\n00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:47.608\nOn the local accounts side, the main\nreason most people use the local accounts\n\n64\n00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:49.720\nis cuz they're easy, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.590\n&gt;&gt; They don't depend on anything else.\n\n66\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.090\nI can take one Mac all by\nitself with no network and\n\n67\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.620\ncreate a user account on it, and it works.\n\n68\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.250\nRight?\nIt's there.\n\n69\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.860\nIt just works, to quote Steve Jobs.\n\n70\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.990\nSo I use the login and that's that, right?\n\n71\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.130\nSo for most people,\nthat's exactly what they want.\n\n72\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.580\nIf I'm not gonna share my\ncomputer with somebody,\n\n73\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.130\nI don't need a bunch of user accounts.\n\n74\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.880\nI just need the one right\nhere on my machine, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.460\nWhere it starts to break down\nis if I have multiple machines.\n\n76\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.820\nWell, even there,\nApple has started helping out with their,\n\n77\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.521\nwhat's a kind of a closeted\ndirectory service, which is iCloud.\n\n78\n00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:29.340\niCloud and the Apple ID.\n\n79\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.340\nWhen you set up an Apple ID,\nthat's a centralized username and\n\n80\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.246\npassword that's stored on Apple servers,\nand you can log in to your iPhone,\n\n81\n00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:42.414\nyour iPad, your Mac Book,\nyour your iMac all with that Apple ID.\n\n82\n00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:45.179\nOne account logging in on all\nthose different machines,\n\n83\n00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:47.031\nthat's pretty slick stuff, right?\n\n84\n00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:48.648\nThat works out really well.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n85\n00:03:48.648 --> 00:03:50.727\n&gt;&gt; And that is a directory service.\n\n86\n00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:55.370\nBut, it's a directory service\ncompletely controlled by Apple.\n\n87\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.530\nApple could turn it off tomorrow\nif they didn't want it running.\n\n88\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.191\nIf the US government\ngave them a subpoena for\n\n89\n00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:04.330\na user's Apple credentials,\nthey would have to turn them over.\n\n90\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.290\nThat kind of thing happens when you're\nusing somebody else's directory service.\n\n91\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.840\nSo for most companies, that's not okay.\n\n92\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.346\nFor most companies,\n\n93\n00:04:13.346 --> 00:04:18.720\nthey want to have a centralized\ndirectory service that they control.\n\n94\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.150\nAnd that way, if an employee gets let go,\nthey have control over that account.\n\n95\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.352\nThey can disable that account.\n\n96\n00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:26.100\nVersus if an employee that gets let go and\n\n97\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.610\nthey're using an Apple ID, that's between\nthat employee and Apple, not the company.\n\n98\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.170\nThey are actually starting to roll\nout these company managements, but\n\n99\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.420\nthey're really focusing on schools.\n\n100\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.680\nSo for enterprises,\nthere's not a great solution for that yet.\n\n101\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.422\nWell, not a great solution from Apple.\n\n102\n00:04:39.422 --> 00:04:43.506\nThe solution is to build up\nyour own directory service.\n\n103\n00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:45.815\nAnd that's what a lot of companies do.\n\n104\n00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:47.405\nAnd at a minimum,\n\n105\n00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:50.475\na directory service is gonna be\nproviding a centralized user database.\n\n106\n00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:51.445\nThat's the main thing we care about.\n\n107\n00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:53.714\nThat's the main thing we're gonna\nfocus on here in this episode.\n\n108\n00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:56.925\nBut directory services oftentimes\ngo even further than that, and\n\n109\n00:04:56.925 --> 00:05:00.037\nthey give you the ability to do\ncentralized phone directories.\n\n110\n00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:01.660\nYou can do policies.\n\n111\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.840\nYou can set a policy that says,\n\n112\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.000\nthese user accounts are only\nallowed to log in between 8 AM and\n\n113\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.310\n5 PM, and these other user accounts\ncan log in whenever they want.\n\n114\n00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.480\nAnd that way, you can restrict like,\n\n115\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.420\nmaybe student accounts are restricted\nmore than instructor or teacher accounts.\n\n116\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.207\nYou can do that when you have a directory\nservices all centrally managed.\n\n117\n00:05:19.207 --> 00:05:21.610\nThose are all reasons why\nwe'd want to have that.\n\n118\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.320\nAnd all of those reasons center around\nbusiness, enterprise, education.\n\n119\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.420\nIt's not really a home user tactic.\n\n120\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.090\nAnd with Apple products, they're\nnormally targeted to end users, right?\n\n121\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.000\nThat's where a lot of that stuff is sold.\n\n122\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.620\nBut that doesn't mean that they're just\ncompletely ignoring the enterprise.\n\n123\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.070\nThe pieces are there.\n\n124\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.472\nWe just have to know [INAUDIBLE]\nto find them, turn them on,\n\n125\n00:05:41.472 --> 00:05:44.010\nand start to make use of them.\n&gt;&gt; So what are the most popular\n\n126\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.760\ndirectory services?\n&gt;&gt; There's a number of solutions\n\n127\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.340\nthat are out there.\n\n128\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.710\nIn the business,\nin the private sector world,\n\n129\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.545\nthe most popular one is actually from\nMicrosoft, the Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n130\n00:05:54.545 --> 00:06:00.020\nAnd in an Apple show like this, we\nnormally wanna focus on an Apple product.\n\n131\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.630\nApple did have a directory service\nthat was called Open Directory.\n\n132\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.570\nSo Apple Open Directory was part of the\nApple Server product for many, many years.\n\n133\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.850\nAt the end of 2017, they announced\nthey were ending support for it, and\n\n134\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.570\nkilling it off.\n\n135\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.190\nAnd so in fact, if you fire it up, here,\n\n136\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.680\nI think I've got it in\nthe background somewhere here.\n\n137\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.850\nSo this is the latest Apple Server app,\nand\n\n138\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.470\nwhat you used to be able\nto do is fire it up.\n\n139\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.580\nAnd see how we've got like users and\n\n140\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.491\ngroups right here?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:28.744\n&gt;&gt; You used to be able to go under\n\n142\n00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:30.691\nAdvance, and you'd have Open Directory.\n\n143\n00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.860\nNow, I go under Advance and it's just.\n\n144\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.241\nThe server app has had\nall that stuff removed.\n\n145\n00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:41.927\nThat Open Directory was actually built off\nan open source product called OpenLDAP.\n\n146\n00:06:41.927 --> 00:06:44.733\nLDAP stands for\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n147\n00:06:44.733 --> 00:06:47.738\nAnd OpenLDAP is still supported, right?\n\n148\n00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:49.429\nJust not by Apple.\n\n149\n00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:52.130\nSo it's an open source project,\nyou can go and download it and install it.\n\n150\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.383\nYou can even install it on your Mac.\n\n151\n00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:56.517\nYou can use utilities like Mac Ports or\nBrute to install it and\n\n152\n00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:59.080\nkeep it updated and get it up and running.\n\n153\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.580\nBut because Apple has dropped support for\nit, it's not something you want to deploy.\n\n154\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.500\nIf you're creating a new directory,\nyou don't wanna go that route.\n\n155\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.019\nMicrosoft's Active Directory has\nbeen supported for over 20 years,\n\n156\n00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:15.722\njust about 20 years, and\nhas a huge enterprise movement behind it.\n\n157\n00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:17.920\nA lot of businesses have Windows machines,\nand\n\n158\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.210\nso they've already got\nan Active Directory.\n\n159\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.340\nIt's so prevalent out there,\nthat Apple said, hey, we can support that.\n\n160\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.648\nAnd so, they've made where your Macs\ncan connect to the Active Directory.\n\n161\n00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:32.690\nSo even though it's a Microsoft directory,\nyour Apple products will connect and\n\n162\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.000\noperate in it just fine.\n\n163\n00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.480\nSo that functionality is pretty cool,\nwe've got direct support for that.\n\n164\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.740\nOpenLDAP is still supported,\njust not by Apple, and\n\n165\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.647\nwe can connect our Macs to it and\nconnect there.\n\n166\n00:07:43.647 --> 00:07:45.000\nAnd then, there's other products as well.\n\n167\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.620\nAnd I mentioned iCloud, and\n\n168\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.090\nthere's third party extensions you can\nadd to add other directory services.\n\n169\n00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.700\nAgain, none of that is supported by Apple,\n\n170\n00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.720\nit's supported by whatever company\nyou get that directory from.\n\n171\n00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.094\nBut in the real world, realistically,\nMicrosoft's Active Directory and\n\n172\n00:07:59.094 --> 00:08:03.126\nOpenLDAP are the two most common,\nwith Microsoft's Active Director\n\n173\n00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:07.590\nreally Controlling probably,\n80% of the enterprise directory market.\n\n174\n00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.826\nI mean it's a huge huge percentage,\nso that's usually gonna be the one we\n\n175\n00:08:10.826 --> 00:08:13.310\nencounter.\n&gt;&gt; So Don why would a company choose\n\n176\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.850\none versus the other?\n&gt;&gt; It usually boils down to\n\n177\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.270\nfeatures, right.\n\n178\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.780\nFor a business,\nif you're largely a Microsoft shop,\n\n179\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.550\nit makes sense that you'd want\nto use the Microsoft directory.\n\n180\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.690\nBut Microsoft's Active Directory actually\nprovides a lot of other features as well\n\n181\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.080\nlike Group Policy Management, and\nmultiple writable master databases,\n\n182\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.070\nand all these other crazy things that it\ndoes, that it does a really good job at,\n\n183\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.500\nand those wouldn't be all\nthe reasons to choose it.\n\n184\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.440\nOpen LDAP will be a good choice if\nyou wanted to stay open source,\n\n185\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.960\nyou didn't wanna be bound\nto one particular vendor.\n\n186\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.130\nYou know that it can connect\nto a number of things, but\n\n187\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.380\nOpen LDAP has a far far smaller\nfeature set than Active Directory.\n\n188\n00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.380\nOpen LDAP is really focused on\njust maintaining accounts, and\n\n189\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.440\nthe data that surrounds those accounts,\nnot really providing policy features.\n\n190\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.010\nNow in the Apple world we don't\nnecessarily need those policy features\n\n191\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.450\nbecause we do have Apples Profile Manager,\nand\n\n192\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.860\nother utilities like Apple Remote Desktop\nthat let's us control the settings and\n\n193\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.260\nconfiguration of our Macs.\n\n194\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.040\nSo if we wanna use OpenLDAP\ncombined with Profile Manager,\n\n195\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.340\nwe get basically the same functionality\nwe would at Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n196\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.170\nSo you've got some flexibility there.\n\n197\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.190\nBut I'll tell you, if you put out\na job posting in the want ads and\n\n198\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.070\nsay I wanna hire an Active Directory\nEngineer, you get tons of applicants.\n\n199\n00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.100\nIf you put out a posting saying I\nwanna hire an OpenLDAP engineer,\n\n200\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.270\nyou'll get three or four applicants.\n\n201\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.200\nThis is a much much smaller pool.\n\n202\n00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.460\nSo Microsoft Active Directory is easier\nfor companies to support, and that's\n\n203\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.691\nusually what drives people to choosing it.\n&gt;&gt; How do we configure Mac OS\n\n204\n00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:43.380\nto use a directory service.\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so the cool thing here is that\n\n205\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.287\nmost of the directory services that\nare out there have all standardized on\n\n206\n00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:51.446\nthe LDAP protocol, the lightweight\ndirectory access protocol, OpenLDAP,\n\n207\n00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:55.688\nApple's Open Directory, Microsoft's\nActive Directory, the all use LDAP.\n\n208\n00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:58.237\nAnd so in Mac OS,\nApple's integrated support for\n\n209\n00:09:58.237 --> 00:10:01.710\nconnecting to LDAP directories,\nthey don't care what kind it is.\n\n210\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.130\nThey don't care if it's active directory\nor open directory or whatever.\n\n211\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.990\nWe connect the same way but\nit's not connected by default.\n\n212\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.620\nSo for example here, I've got this Mac.\n\n213\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.910\nThis is a Mac OS high sierra install.\n\n214\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.360\nIt's a pretty fresh and clean install.\n\n215\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.670\nI haven't even done updates on it yet.\n\n216\n00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.410\nJust a straight up install.\n\n217\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.700\nAnd it's got a couple\nof user accounts on it.\n\n218\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.730\nSo I created a user account for\nmyself, and I have a user account for\n\n219\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.690\nChristopher Walken cuz he needs one.\n&gt;&gt; Christopher Walken?\n\n220\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.000\n&gt;&gt; And, but they're local user accounts.\n\n221\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.380\nSo if I go into my System Preferences, and\n\n222\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.100\nI go into my Users and Groups, I can\nsee those user accounts right here and\n\n223\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.750\nthey are just local users they not part\nof a directory, they are right here.\n\n224\n00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.400\nIf I take an account\nlike Christopher's and\n\n225\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.420\nI delete it,\nhere let me unlock the screen.\n\n226\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.460\nSo if I take that account and I delete it\nwell he only existed right here on this\n\n227\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.850\nmachine so when I delete him then that\nwould just the end of his account.\n\n228\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.950\nIf I create more accounts here,\n\n229\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.490\nthat would just be right here\non this machine and that's it.\n\n230\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.060\nIt wouldn't affect any other\nmachine that's out there.\n\n231\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.940\nSo these are local users, right, and\nthat's what's all displayed by default,\n\n232\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.810\nthat's what's enabled by default.\n\n233\n00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.580\nBut down here at the bottom\nI've got login options.\n\n234\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.130\nAnd if I choose login options I see\nsome settings that mostly pertain to\n\n235\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.300\nthe user experience on the system.\n\n236\n00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.680\nBut down here at the bottom,\nyou'll see Network Account Server, and\n\n237\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.440\na Join button, okay?\n\n238\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.210\nThis is how we can bind\nto a directory service.\n\n239\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.610\nWe can connect up, and basically,\n\n240\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.800\nestablish a connection between our Mac,\nand that directory service.\n\n241\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.240\nNow, before we do that,\nI wanna do one quick change to my Mac.\n\n242\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.880\nI don't necessarily need to but\nyour benefit I want to show you.\n\n243\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.090\nWhen you connect to a directory service,\n\n244\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.390\nyour Mac registers itself\nwith that directory service.\n\n245\n00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.630\nAnd so an entry is gonna be created in\nthat directory services database that\n\n246\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.690\nsays, here's this Mac that connected.\n\n247\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:59.570\nAnd it's gonna give it a name and\nthe name comes from your actual Macs name.\n\n248\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.700\nAnd most people don't know their Macs name\nBecause when it creates a first account,\n\n249\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.690\nit'll just give a name, like Don's\nMacBook Pro or Christopher's MacBook Pro.\n\n250\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.220\nAnd a lot of times,\nwe'll have an apostrophe in the name,\n\n251\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.850\nwhich can cause some problems\nwith LDAP directories.\n\n252\n00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.522\nSo it's a good idea to change the name\nof your Mac before you join us so\n\n253\n00:12:17.522 --> 00:12:21.080\nthat it's a nice standard name\nthat you can recognize what it is.\n\n254\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.210\nThe way we do that is back\nunder System Preferences,\n\n255\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.220\nif you go into the sharing preference,\n\n256\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.740\nthe name of your Mac is right up there\non the top of the sharing preference.\n\n257\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.650\nI'm gonna rename mine.\n\n258\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.320\nI'm just gonna call it Lab-client02,\nso this is my lab client.\n\n259\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.400\nYou can call it whatever you want,\nbut I do recommend that you try and\n\n260\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.720\nuse a fairly normal name.\n\n261\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.450\nI try and avoid punctuation.\n\n262\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.370\nA lot of times it'll work fine, but it can\ncause problems down the line with scripts,\n\n263\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.990\nand administrative tasks,\nto see if they get performed.\n\n264\n00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.060\nAll right, so now, I've got my name set,\nI can go and I can bind to the directory.\n\n265\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.480\nNow, before I try and\nbind to the directory,\n\n266\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.410\none thing that my Mac is going to have\nto do, is try and find the directory.\n\n267\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.430\nWell if the directory server is on\nthe same network as you then it\n\n268\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.370\nwill find it pretty easier it's right\nthere on the network, no big deal.\n\n269\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.960\nBut most of the time a directory server is\nnot on the same network as your client.\n\n270\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.570\nWe are talking about business enterprise\nthey usually have multiple networks.\n\n271\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.040\nThe server is usually\nin a protected network,\n\n272\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.670\nyour client is in a different network,\nright?\n\n273\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.320\nSo in order to find it,\n\n274\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.290\nwe usually have to make sure that\nwe're using our company's DNS servers.\n\n275\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.930\nI don't know what DNS servers I'm using\nright now so I'm going to go in and\n\n276\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.430\nset my DNS servers to make sure I'm\nusing my company's DNS servers.\n\n277\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.970\nSo I'm going to go under network and\ninside of my network settings,\n\n278\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:44.570\nI'm using DHCP And I'm getting DNS\nservers from me DHCPC server alright.\n\n279\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:49.580\nSo I'm gonna override those\nvalues to change it and\n\n280\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.420\nuse my company's DNS servers right?\n\n281\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:59.050\nSo when I do that, I can come in and\nwhoops It's gonna get mad at me here.\n\n282\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.710\nI can come into my advanced settings which\nI was trying to do it right from here but\n\n283\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.320\nmy advance button is off\nthe bottom of my screen.\n\n284\n00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.080\nSo I'm gonna resize this real quick so\n\n285\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.300\nthat I can actually see\nthe bottom of my screen.\n\n286\n00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.800\nThere we go, all right.\n\n287\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.540\nSo what I'm looking for is down here\nunder advanced, and I can go to DNS, and\n\n288\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.410\nright now I'm getting my\nDNS servers from DHCP.\n\n289\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.050\nSo I need to override that and\nput in my directory server,\n\n290\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.800\nor either my directory server\nwill be my DNS server or\n\n291\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.360\nI'll have special DNS servers that\nare supporting my directories.\n\n292\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.730\nSo I'm gonna do that and\npunch that in so I've got it in place.\n\n293\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.000\nAnd then this is optional by\nyour local search domains.\n\n294\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.380\nIt'll actually speed up your\ncomputer logging in and\n\n295\n00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.650\nbrowsing the network if you put\nyour directory's name here.\n\n296\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.660\nYour directory, whether it's\nActive Directory or OpenLDAP or whatever,\n\n297\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.260\nit will have a name,\na name that's assigned to it.\n\n298\n00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.840\nAnd in my case,\nit's just called lab.itpro.tv.\n\n299\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.640\nSo I'm gonna punch that name\nin here in my search domain.\n\n300\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.070\nWhen I'm browsing the network, if I try\nand get to a computer by a single name,\n\n301\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:06.400\nlike lab-client01, it'll know to\nstick lab.itprotv on the end of it.\n\n302\n00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.010\nAnd it'll find that machine faster.\n\n303\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.420\nSo that kinda speeds things up.\n\n304\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.170\nYou don't have to do it,\nbut it's a good idea to.\n\n305\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.060\nAll right, so\nnow that I've got DNS set correctly,\n\n306\n00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.160\nI know that I'll be able to\nfind my directory server.\n\n307\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:25.530\nAnd now I'm ready to jump in and\nactually get things set to connect to it.\n\n308\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.950\nSo I'm gonna go back to my\nsystem preferences, and\n\n309\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.418\nI'm gonna go to Users &amp; Groups.\n\n310\n00:15:29.418 --> 00:15:30.216\nYou know what?\n\n311\n00:15:30.216 --> 00:15:32.459\nProbably also worth mentioning here.\n\n312\n00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:36.960\nIf I'm in a business and I'm using\nDHCP servers, DHCP is probably already\n\n313\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.050\nhanding out the right search domain and\nthe right DNS server.\n\n314\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.180\nSo I might not have to\nhave made that change.\n\n315\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.740\nRight now I'm in a lab environment, so\n\n316\n00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.160\nI had to make the change.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n317\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n318\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.060\nif I go down here to my log in options,\n\n319\n00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.590\nI've got network accounts\nwhere I'm gonna hit, Join.\n\n320\n00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.470\nAnd it's gonna ask me the name\nof the server, all right?\n\n321\n00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.140\nIf I know the name of the server,\nI can punch it in here,\n\n322\n00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.780\nit might have even found it for me.\n\n323\n00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.365\nIf you drop down the list here,\nit might find it and show it there,\n\n324\n00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:03.235\nin my case, it's not finding it,\ncuz there are different networks So,\n\n325\n00:16:03.235 --> 00:16:04.380\nI needed to type in the name.\n\n326\n00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:10.500\nAnd the name of my network\nis lab.itpro.tv, okay.\n\n327\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.590\nWhen I punch that in,\nsee how my screen changed.\n\n328\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.380\nIt changed cuz it found the server.\n\n329\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.590\nIt said here is this DNS name,\nlet me look at the DNS server.\n\n330\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.770\nAnd yep yep!\n\n331\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.940\nThere's a directory server here,\nlet me connect you to it, okay.\n\n332\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:29.250\nIt wants a computer name and\na username in the directory already,\n\n333\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.740\nthat has permissions to add a computer,\nall right?\n\n334\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.920\nSo I've got a user account\ncalled administrator,\n\n335\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.970\nwhich if I spell right will probably work.\n\n336\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.560\nAnd I'll punch in the password for\nthat account, okay.\n\n337\n00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.350\nNow what's gonna happen is,\nwhen I click OK, this computer is going to\n\n338\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.870\nregister itself with the directory\nserver it's called binding, so\n\n339\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.880\nit's gonna bind to that directory server.\n\n340\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.580\nLet me show you the directory server.\n\n341\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.320\nSo this is a Windows Server\n2016 machine and\n\n342\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.668\nit's running the active directory, right.\n\n343\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.640\nAnd, inside of the active directory,\nI've got this Computers folder.\n\n344\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.710\nAnd it shows all the computers that\nare in my domain, in my directory.\n\n345\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.770\nAnd right now I've got none,\nno computers are bound.\n\n346\n00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.380\nThere's one, there's the actual\ndirectory server right here, right?\n\n347\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.120\nBut as far as computers,\nthere's nobody, okay?\n\n348\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.240\nSo when I bind that computer, it's gonna\nshow up right here in this folder.\n\n349\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.830\nSo let me go back over to my Mac and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n350\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.720\nhit OK and\nit's gonna connect up to that server.\n\n351\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.890\nSo it's talking to\nthe Active Directory server and\n\n352\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.300\nit even knows that it's\nActive Directory at this point.\n\n353\n00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.060\nSee how it says that Active Directory?\n\n354\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.770\nIf it was open LDAP it would know that and\n\n355\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.670\nit would say it cuz it\nhas talked to the server.\n\n356\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:43.020\nSo now it's talking, it's sending the user\ncredentials the username and password.\n\n357\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.490\nAnd then it's saying,\nokay I'm lab client 02,\n\n358\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.080\ncan you bind me to the directory, so\nlet me start using your user accounts.\n\n359\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.650\nNow, while we are waiting on that,\nlet's talk about this user accounts.\n\n360\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.840\nActually I finished it, done it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.900\n&gt;&gt; Finished a little faster than I\n\n362\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.970\nthought, so anyhow it did finish,\nI see it's bound now,\n\n363\n00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.810\nITProTV lab showing up down here and\nit's got a green light.\n\n364\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.460\nWhich means not only I'm I connected\nto the server, but I can see it.\n\n365\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.680\nI'm on a laptop.\n\n366\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.220\nSo if I take my laptop and I go down the\nstreet, I'm bound to the directory, but\n\n367\n00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.050\nI won't see it.\n\n368\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.350\nThat light will turn red.\n\n369\n00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.180\nI can't see the server.\n\n370\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.060\nBut this means I'm actively\ntalking to the server and\n\n371\n00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.130\nI'm able to use those\nnetwork accounts now, right?\n\n372\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.610\nNow, for user accounts on the left,\nI just have Don and Christopher.\n\n373\n00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:29.581\nZach what if Zach wants to be\nable to log into this machine?\n\n374\n00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:32.010\nWell too bad he can't okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.410\n&gt;&gt; I could create a local account here but\n\n376\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.910\nI wanna create a network account, an\naccount for Zach, that's on the network so\n\n377\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.250\nhe can log into any machine that's\nbound this directory right?\n\n378\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:45.560\nIf I jump back over to the directory\nserver, my computers here are empty.\n\n379\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.960\nNow I told you just a moment\nthe computer is gonna show up.\n\n380\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.780\nThis panel doesn't refresh on its own,\nso I've got to tell it to refresh.\n\n381\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.100\nAnd there it is, there's lab,\nclient02, right?\n\n382\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.090\nIt's bound and\nnow it's showing up in the directory.\n\n383\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.930\nIf I double click on it and\n\n384\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.690\nI kinda look at its details,\nI can see that it's running Mac OS 10.\n\n385\n00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.931\nMicrosoft hasn't changed\nit to say Mac OS yet.\n\n386\n00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:09.750\n10.13.3, so there it is, it's connected.\n\n387\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.330\nThat's my Mac.\n\n388\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.030\nAnd then I'm gonna go down here to staff\nand I've got a user for me, right, but\n\n389\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.600\nI'm gonna create a user for Zach.\n\n390\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.950\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\njust tell it I wanna create a new user\n\n391\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:31.260\nand it's gonna be Zach Memos and\nthere we go.\n\n392\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.510\nAnd then, I'll need to pick a password for\nhim, punch that in.\n\n393\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.001\nAnd I'll make it where your\npassword doesn't expire.\n\n394\n00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:44.210\nThere we go, all right.\n\n395\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.180\nSo that's gonna create an account for\nZack.\n\n396\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.280\nNow, that account is in\nthe directory server, all right?\n\n397\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.760\nIt's not on the map.\n\n398\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.990\nIf I go back to my Mac.\n\n399\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.560\nRight here I don't see Zach in the list.\n\n400\n00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.200\nBut that's okay.\n\n401\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.710\nFrom now on, whenever I log into my Mac,\nI've got a choice.\n\n402\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.500\nI can log in with a local account, or\n\n403\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.820\nI can log in with a directory account,\nI've got a choice.\n\n404\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.570\nIt's a good idea to keep\nat least one local account,\n\n405\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.360\nbecause if you're ever off the network,\nyou can't see the directories.\n\n406\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.160\nSo [INAUDIBLE] be able to\nlog in to fix your Mac and\n\n407\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.430\nget a connector to troubleshoot, so\nit's a good idea to have one account.\n\n408\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.950\nBut now,\n\n409\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.250\nI can log in with any of the directory\naccounts in that directory server.\n\n410\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.530\nSo, at this point, we're connected up,\nwe're in business.\n\n411\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:33.638\nAnd now, we can actually start to use\nthose directory users, to be able\n\n412\n00:20:33.638 --> 00:20:36.821\nto connect and get kind of on the system.\n&gt;&gt; Don,\n\n413\n00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:40.930\nhow does the system know we wanna login?\n&gt;&gt; Good point, right?\n\n414\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.680\nSo I'm kind of leaving something\nimportant off here, I'm connected, right?\n\n415\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.100\nTechnically the magic is done.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n416\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.620\n&gt;&gt; And the show's over.\n\n417\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.300\nBut there's a little bit more to it,\n\n418\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.060\nlike how do we wanna tell the system\nI wanna login to [INAUDIBLE], right?\n\n419\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.540\nWell, our login screen\nis gonna have a subtle,\n\n420\n00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.230\nsubtle change to it, right, very little.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n421\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna log out,\n\n422\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.950\nor I guess I could use fast user\nswitching, but I'll log out.\n\n423\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:05.200\nSo when I log out,\nit's gonna take me to my login screen.\n\n424\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.730\nAnd normally on the login screen,\nwhat we see are the icons for our users.\n\n425\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.520\nThere's Christopher Walken, there's Don\nPezet that's what we normally see right?\n\n426\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.600\nBut this time I've now\ngot one that says other.\n\n427\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.190\nOther is the dead giveaway,\n\n428\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.780\nthat you're connected to a directory\nservice, it has to do other.\n\n429\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.900\nAnd the reason is there might be 10,000\nuser accounts on that director server, so\n\n430\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.050\nis it gonna draw 10,000 circles on\nmy screen with little pictures?\n\n431\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.960\nIt would take an hour to log in.\n\n432\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.040\nSo instead, it just says other.\n\n433\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.760\nNow, if I've logged recently, a lot of\ntimes it'll take me to this screen,\n\n434\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.030\nwhere it's saying, hey,\nyou're ready to log in as you.\n\n435\n00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.250\nSo you might have to click the back arrow.\n\n436\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.900\nBut once you're back on this screen,\nyou can click Other.\n\n437\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.540\nAnd that's your way of telling it, hey,\nI'm gonna log in with a directory account.\n\n438\n00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.910\nNow technically,\nyou can log in with a local account, or\n\n439\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.430\na directory account from here.\n\n440\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:01.050\nSo if I were to type in Christopher Walken\nand punch in his password,\n\n441\n00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.560\nit would say, there's no directory\naccount called Christopher Walken, but\n\n442\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.190\nthere's a local one,\nwill log you in locally, all right?\n\n443\n00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.320\nBut I'm going to log in as Zach,\nand Zach's\n\n444\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.310\nusername on the directory was zmemos, or\nZach Memos, I can type it out if I wanted.\n\n445\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.260\nAnd then I'll punch in his password.\n\n446\n00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.570\nNow, that account does not\nexist on this machine.\n\n447\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.350\nIt exist in the directory.\n\n448\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.560\nWhen I click that arrow, it's going\nto reach out to the directory server.\n\n449\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.810\nAnd it's going to say, I don't know this\nuser name and password, do you know them.\n\n450\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.266\nAnd the directory server is going to\nlook at it and say, yea that's Zack,\n\n451\n00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:36.190\nwe go way back.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.120\n&gt;&gt; I've known him since high school.\n\n453\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.360\nAnd so then it says,\nyeah all right let's let them in and\n\n454\n00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.640\nso the server is telling us it's okay\nto trust that username and password, or\n\n455\n00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.700\nthe server will tell us,\nno that password is wrong.\n\n456\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.790\nI don't know who that is,\ndon't let them in right?\n\n457\n00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.270\nThe server is making that decision, so the\nclient doesn't have to have that massive\n\n458\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.730\nuser database,\nthe server does it for us, right?\n\n459\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.840\nAnd now we're logged in,\nhey I'm logged in as Zach.\n\n460\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.440\nRight, if I go into my system preferences.\n\n461\n00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.360\nAnd I go into users and computers.\n\n462\n00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.270\nThere's Zach Memos right?\n\n463\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.280\nBut he doesn't actually\nexist on this machine.\n\n464\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.440\nSee how it says, network account,\na managed network account.\n\n465\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.940\nThis is not a local user on this machine.\n\n466\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.640\nIt's a network account that's\ncoming from a directory server, but\n\n467\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.120\nhe can log in, he can access the system.\n\n468\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.560\nHe has a home folder.\n\n469\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.520\nIf I were to browse in the finder and\n\n470\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.350\nlet me just browse into Macintosh HD and\nUsers, right, there's ZMemos.\n\n471\n00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.260\nHe' got his own home folder, right?\n\n472\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.740\nAnd Desktop, Documents, Downloads, all of\nthe other things that a regular local user\n\n473\n00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.930\nwould have, it created this\nthe first time he logged in.\n\n474\n00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:53.329\nHe's now logged in and he can get up and\nhe can walk to another computer and\n\n475\n00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:54.931\nlog in there too, right?\n\n476\n00:23:54.931 --> 00:23:57.877\nBecause now it's the server\nthat's making that decision.\n\n477\n00:23:57.877 --> 00:24:02.383\nAnd if he wants to change his password, he\ncould change his password right here And\n\n478\n00:24:02.383 --> 00:24:07.219\nit's changed everywhere, because everybody\nis phoning home to that central server,\n\n479\n00:24:07.219 --> 00:24:10.390\nthat one place,\nhe's now a network account.\n\n480\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.040\nAnd so in a business environment,\nthis is incredibly common.\n\n481\n00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.820\nRight?\n\n482\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.320\nAnd there's two sides to it, so one,\n\n483\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.290\nit's a heck of a lot easier to create\nnew accounts for new employees.\n\n484\n00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.370\nBut secondly,\nit's easier to terminate accounts.\n\n485\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.924\nIf Zach had logins on ten\ndifferent computers and\n\n486\n00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:30.543\none finally like flipped his lid and\nwent crazy and we had to fire him.\n\n487\n00:24:30.543 --> 00:24:31.980\n[LAUGH] This could happen.\n\n488\n00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.954\nI would have to rush real quick to all ten\ncomputers and disable his account right?\n\n489\n00:24:36.954 --> 00:24:39.810\nBut because it's a directory server\nI can just log into one place and\n\n490\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.430\nI can disable that account and\nnow he can't log in anywhere.\n\n491\n00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.140\nAll in one fell swoop.\n\n492\n00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.760\nThat is the type of thing you can do when\nyou have a centralized directory service.\n\n493\n00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.430\nSo it's really important for\nbusinesses to have that because it\n\n494\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.700\ndoes streamline the whole process\nof managing user accounts.\n\n495\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.300\nAnd MacOS has that support, I did it here\nwith Microsoft's Active Directory but you\n\n496\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:03.300\ncan do it with Open LDAP, with any number\nof other LDAP compliant user structures.\n\n497\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.140\nIt supports that and\nconnects to them and it works\n\n498\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.670\npretty painlessly once it is in place.\n&gt;&gt; That's a good thing that didn't get\n\n499\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.600\nterminated via services, because that\nChristopher Walken, you can trust him.\n\n500\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.430\nAnyway, before you move on anything\nelse you would like to say?\n\n501\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.310\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of a ongoing process you\n\n502\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.980\nhave to deal with, right.\n\n503\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.090\nSo, you've got to get these\nmachines bound to the directory.\n\n504\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.950\nAny time you buy a new laptop, new desktop\nit's gotta get bound to the directory and\n\n505\n00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.940\nso it's a little bit of a manual process.\n\n506\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.790\nIf you use the Profile Manager you can\nactually create a default profile that\n\n507\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.130\nautomatically connects your MACs to your\ndirectory and that will streamline things.\n\n508\n00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.650\nSo, if you're doing\na centralized directory,\n\n509\n00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.470\nI usually encourage you to use Profile\nManager in addition to the directory.\n\n510\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.280\nThat gives you the best management\nsuite possible for most businesses.\n\n511\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.710\nFor schools they actually have a whole\nseparate suite of software called\n\n512\n00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.930\nApple Classroom that let's you manage\nthe student accounts through Apple IDs.\n\n513\n00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.610\nAnd that's a pretty cool one too because\nyou don't have to maintain the server.\n\n514\n00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.320\nHere we have to maintain\nthe server though.\n\n515\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.920\nI've got a Microsoft server in\nthe background that I've got to update and\n\n516\n00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.970\nmaintain and manage and\nthat's kind of a pain.\n\n517\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.380\nRight, so we've got to make sure we\ndo that though because if we neglect\n\n518\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.940\nthe server, an attacker breaks\ninto the server, what can they do?\n\n519\n00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.240\nThey can create credentials for\nthemselves and\n\n520\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.955\nhave access to all your machines, right?\n\n521\n00:26:16.955 --> 00:26:20.860\nThat essential service is an attack\ntarget so you've got to make sure that\n\n522\n00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.350\nyou take care of it.\n&gt;&gt; Well done, sir.\n\n523\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.060\nThank you, Don.\n\n524\n00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.510\nAnother great episode.\n\n525\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.950\nAnd by the way, make sure you see every\nepisode of Apple Certified Associate.\n\n526\n00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.000\nYou're gonna be very glad you did, and\nyou'll also be in the course library.\n\n527\n00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.740\nThere's thousands of other videos there,\nand they are there to help you go further.\n\n528\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.090\nSo check those out, too.\n\n529\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.890\nEverybody know about ITProTV.\n\n530\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.550\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n531\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.926\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n532\n00:26:41.926 --> 00:26:44.260\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n533\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:51.356\n[MUSIC]\n\n534\n00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:56.619\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.421\n[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:10.610\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.800\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching IT Pro TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.730\nempowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.510\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Apple Certified Associate.\n\n8\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.366\nAnd we are gonna be doing some\nfile sharing on this episode and\n\n9\n00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.623\nthe person who is sharing those\nfiles is Don Pezet, right over here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:27.679\nDon, good to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.936\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I am in a giving mood today, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:29.936 --> 00:00:31.429\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna share files with all\n\n13\n00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.626\nthe computers that I come across and hope\nyou guys learned how to do that as well.\n\n14\n00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:37.720\nObviously, if you have multiple\ncomputers on a network,\n\n15\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.400\nchanging information is\nkind of an important thing.\n\n16\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.360\nSo we're gonna talk about how that\nprocess works inside of Macs, and\n\n17\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.230\nhow we're able to exchange data over the\nnetwork between systems and even interrupt\n\n18\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.120\nwith non-Macs, Windows, for example,\nto be able to share information or\n\n19\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.250\nget files and resources that way as well,\nall right here in this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.150\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhat network protocols does macOS support?\n\n21\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, one of the cool things\nabout macOS is that it is, well,\n\n22\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.320\nit's got this nice pretty GUI on top,\nunder the hood it's running BSD Unix-\n\n23\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n24\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.926\n&gt;&gt; Which is a server grade operating\nsystem that is very, very mature.\n\n25\n00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:17.160\nIt's been around since the 70s and\nsupports a ton of protocols.\n\n26\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.120\nAnd as a result,\nmacOS supports a ton of protocols,\n\n27\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.120\nbecause it's running on top of that.\n\n28\n00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.938\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n29\n00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:25.160\n&gt;&gt; We can actually connect\nto all sorts of stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.380\nThe big thing though is whether or\nnot we'll have a graphical utility for it.\n\n31\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.960\nIn the GUI, in the graphical user\ninterface from macOS, we can browse and\n\n32\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.387\nconnect to servers that are running\na couple of different protocols.\n\n33\n00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:40.876\nWe can use Apple File Protocol, AFP,\nif we're connecting to other Macs and\n\n34\n00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:44.790\nusing things like AppleTalk,\nwe can reach out with that.\n\n35\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.614\nWe can use SMB,\nwhich is Server Message Block.\n\n36\n00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.680\nThat's the protocol used\nby Windows machines.\n\n37\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.448\nSo if you have Microsoft Windows\nin your workplace and\n\n38\n00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:55.919\nyou can connect to their shares,\nit can do SMB.\n\n39\n00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:58.760\nIt can do FTP, File Transfer Protocol.\n\n40\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.860\nFile Transfer Protocol is an unencrypted\ntransfer protocol used in the Unix days.\n\n41\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.610\nIt is not really that great these days\nbecause it centrally used name or\n\n42\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.850\npassword in plain text, not really ideal.\n\n43\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.410\nBut it's still there for\nsome systems like some printer support,\n\n44\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.530\nyou can drop of a PDF and\nthen it will print it right over FTP.\n\n45\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.510\nThere's SFTP,\nSecure File Transfer Protocol,\n\n46\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.970\nthat's where it takes FTP and\nit sticks it in an encrypted SSH tunnel.\n\n47\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.200\nNow we've got security.\n\n48\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.770\nThat's a much better option, right?\n\n49\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.120\nAnd that one is built in.\n\n50\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.960\nThere is NFS.\n\n51\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.480\nNFS is the network file system that's\nused in the Unix world, right?\n\n52\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.715\nWindows doesn't use it much.\n\n53\n00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:41.900\nmacOS doesn't use it much, but\nthe support is there if you need it.\n\n54\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.515\nIf you've got Unix servers,\nyou can connect up as an NFS client and\n\n55\n00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.398\nmacOS can even act as an NFS\nserver if you really want to.\n\n56\n00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:50.371\nThose are bulit-in.\n\n57\n00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.476\nNFS is not very popular, but\n\n58\n00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:56.873\nyou do encounter once in a while\na really rare one, WebDAV.\n\n59\n00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:01.460\nWebDAV is Web Distributed Authoring and\nVersioning.\n\n60\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.270\nIt's a protocol that uses HTTP or HTTPS,\n\n61\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.060\njust like a web browser would, to connect\nup and let you modify files on a server.\n\n62\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.020\nVery, very uncommon,\nnot many people use it, but\n\n63\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.280\nit is out there, and\nmacOS supports it natively.\n\n64\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.180\nThey support all these different protocols\nnatively right inside the OS, but\n\n65\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.890\nit tries to do it in a way that\nit is not really invasive to you.\n\n66\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.280\nIt doesn't make you have to change\nthe way that you do your work.\n\n67\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.440\nAs a result, Apple really focuses\non two protocols, AFP and SMB,\n\n68\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.690\nso Apple File Protocol and\nServer Message Block, SMB.\n\n69\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.160\nAnd oddly enough, SMB is the default.\n\n70\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.644\nSMB, the one from Microsoft\nis the default, not AFP.\n\n71\n00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:44.020\nThe one Apple wrote themselves\nis not the default.\n\n72\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.028\nAnd the reason is Apple has basically\ndone a lot of studies on this and\n\n73\n00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:51.419\nthey found that home users\ndon't share files very much.\n\n74\n00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.116\nIf they do, they just use a USB key or\nsomething to move it between machines,\n\n75\n00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.870\nthey're not really setting up shared\nfolders on networks very often at all.\n\n76\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.090\nA lot of times they'll use iCloud and\nget the same achievement.\n\n77\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.640\nBut in a business environment,\nyou share files all the time, and\n\n78\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.440\nin a business environment,\nthey're normally running Windows machines.\n\n79\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.020\nSo Apple found that SMB was\nthe more popular protocol so\n\n80\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.710\nthat's why they defaulted even\nthough they've got their own.\n\n81\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.657\nBut it supports both and\nwhen you browse the network and\n\n82\n00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:20.030\nstart connecting to file shares,\nit's using these protocols automatically.\n\n83\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.110\nWe don't even have to do anything.\n\n84\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.520\nIt's just happening, right?\n\n85\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.170\nSo for example here, if I take my Mac and\n\n86\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.310\nlet me get it to stop\nbothering me about updates.\n\n87\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.650\nI'm gonna fire up my finder and\nin my Finder,\n\n88\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.020\nit's already scanning the network and\nfinding systems out on the network, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.770\nSo over here on the left,\nI'm finding Cameron's MacBook Pro,\n\n90\n00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.130\nCameron's one of our developers\nhere in the building.\n\n91\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.620\nDon's Macbook Pro, well,\nthat's the machine I'm on.\n\n92\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.920\nEditing Station 1, 2, and 3,\nthat's where our video editors,\n\n93\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.455\nit's finding these machines\non the network, right?\n\n94\n00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:59.820\nLAB-CLIENT02, that's another\nmachine I've got over here.\n\n95\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.490\nNow notice how LAB-CLIENT02 has\nthis question mark on it, right?\n\n96\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.469\nIt's not sharing anything publicly.\n\n97\n00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:07.955\nI can't connect to it.\n\n98\n00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:10.105\nI have to hit Connect As,\nand give it a user name and\n\n99\n00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:12.635\na password to connect in\norder to see anything.\n\n100\n00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:14.285\nSo, if you see a question mark like that,\n\n101\n00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.965\nthat means that there are some kind\nof authentication that's required.\n\n102\n00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:20.305\nAnd if I hit that, it's gonna\nask me to put in a user name and\n\n103\n00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:22.220\na password on that machine.\n\n104\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.518\nSo I'll provide a password for an account\nthat happens to be on that machine.\n\n105\n00:05:26.518 --> 00:05:29.260\nI'll save it in my key chain here,\nand I'll connect up.\n\n106\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.959\nAnd now I see folders that are on that\nmachine and I can browse in here.\n\n107\n00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:38.680\nHere's a Macintosh HD, I can browse right\ninto the hard drive, access the files and\n\n108\n00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.490\nfolders, and I'm doing it all right\nhere from the graphical user interface.\n\n109\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.750\nUsing one of the various protocols\nin the background to connect and\n\n110\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.270\nit's all designed to be super easy and\njust built right into the OS.\n\n111\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.130\n&gt;&gt; How do we know which\nprotocol is being used, Don?\n\n112\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a really good question\nbecause in this case, I don't know, right?\n\n113\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.230\nDid I use SMB, did I use AFP,\ndid I use one of the other ones?\n\n114\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.010\nHard to say, right?\n\n115\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.930\nThe graphical user interface like this is\nintentionally hiding that because your\n\n116\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.360\naverage user doesn't care.\n\n117\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.990\nThey don't care what protocol they\nare using, they just the need file, right?\n\n118\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.870\nSo it's all hidden but\nit is using a protocol, I mean,\n\n119\n00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.780\nwe could really get technical on, drop\nin to a terminal and do a netstat -an.\n\n120\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.095\nI mean, if we start digging really deep in\nhere, we can figure out which protocol it\n\n121\n00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:32.550\nwas when we connected based\non port numbers and things.\n\n122\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.291\nSo when I look here, I see this Port 443\nand that tells me we used SMB to connect,\n\n123\n00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:41.220\nright, so\nwe're able to kinda figure that out.\n\n124\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.170\nThat's not something an end-user\nis going to do, right?\n\n125\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.020\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And they shouldn't have to, right?\n\n126\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.370\nThey shouldn't have to jump\nthrough all those hoops.\n\n127\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.030\nBut what we can do,\nif we just wanna test that ourselves is,\n\n128\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.280\ninstead of browsing this way, which\nis kind of the kid gloves way, right,\n\n129\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.560\nthe way where everything\nis hidden from us.\n\n130\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.604\nInstead of browsing this way,\nyou can browse using your Go Menu.\n\n131\n00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:07.630\nAnd when you choose Go,\nyou can choose connect to server.\n\n132\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.710\nAnd when you hit connect to server,\nit's asked me to put in a server address.\n\n133\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.010\nNow the server address is gonna be\nthe name of the machine, right?\n\n134\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.810\nSo in my case I was connecting\nto lab-client02, right?\n\n135\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.940\nBut as part of that address, you can put\nin what protocol you're using, right?\n\n136\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.250\nSo if I were to say smb://lab-client02,\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.120\nIf I do that and I hit Connect,\nI know that I'm gonna connect using SMB.\n\n138\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.040\nIt's gonna reach out to that system,\nand here it is,\n\n139\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.590\nit's asking me which\nfolder I wanna access.\n\n140\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.738\nI'm already connected to Macintosh HD,\nthat's why it's grayed out.\n\n141\n00:07:40.738 --> 00:07:44.976\nBut I can connect to Christopher's\nhome folder, and I'll choose that and\n\n142\n00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:45.722\nconnect up.\n\n143\n00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:50.272\nAnd now, I know for\na fact I'm using SMB, right?\n\n144\n00:07:50.272 --> 00:07:56.312\nI could also, let me eject this,\nconnections that I've got here.\n\n145\n00:07:56.312 --> 00:08:01.532\nSo I'm gonna disconnect, oops,\nnow I'm connecting to Camerage machine so\n\n146\n00:08:01.532 --> 00:08:05.030\nI'm gonna disconnect from that machine,\nright?\n\n147\n00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.848\nAnd then I'm gonna go up here and\nchoose connect to server and\n\n148\n00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:15.434\ninstead of typing SMB,\nI'm gonna type AFP://lab/client02.\n\n149\n00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:20.543\nAnd when I do that and I hit connect\nit's gonna reach out to that machine and\n\n150\n00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:25.830\nthis time I'm using Apple File Protocol\nand I know I am because I typed it in.\n\n151\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.970\nAnd it may fail to connect,\nif it fails to connect maybe AFP is turned\n\n152\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.970\noff on the other side,\nor it's not supported.\n\n153\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.780\nNow I know which way that\nI'm connecting though.\n\n154\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.660\nAnd the fact that it's taking this long\nto connect tells me that AFP is probably\n\n155\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.000\nturned off on the other side.\n\n156\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.670\nSo SMB is the default for Mac OS, and, in\nfact, a lot of times AFP is turned off and\n\n157\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.350\nI think that's what I'm\nencountering right here.\n\n158\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.210\nSo at this point, yeah, I got an error.\n\n159\n00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.400\nSo I can't connect.\n\n160\n00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.730\nThis is a great way to test though and\n\n161\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.480\nmake sure that you're actually connecting\nwith the protocol that you want.\n\n162\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.420\nThis little box,\n\n163\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.490\nthe connect to server box, it supports\na number of different protocols.\n\n164\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.730\nIf I'm connecting via SMB I type SMB or\nApple File Protocol.\n\n165\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.870\nI type AFP.\n\n166\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.800\nIf it's NFS, I would just type NFS://.\n\n167\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.120\nFTP we would do that\nhere with FTP like that.\n\n168\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.590\nSFTP you actually can't do it from here,\nthat one's not supported in this box.\n\n169\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.802\nYou'd actually have to use\na different client for that.\n\n170\n00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:22.340\nLet's see, what were some of\nthe other ones I mentioned?\n\n171\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.112\nWeb DAV, which we just used\nHTTPS like that to connect.\n\n172\n00:09:26.112 --> 00:09:28.446\nI feel like I'm leaving somebody out.\n\n173\n00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:31.660\nMaybe not, maybe that's it.\n\n174\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.940\nAnd there's other protocols that you can\ndo here that aren't even file related.\n\n175\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.470\nFor example, screen sharing.\n\n176\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.780\nI can do vnc://, and that's gonna do the\nvirtual network computing which will show\n\n177\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.080\nme the screen of that other\nmachine if it's turned on, right,\n\n178\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.220\nif that feature is turned\non on the other side.\n\n179\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.410\nRemember the other side is\nacting like a server, and\n\n180\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.650\nthat server has to be ready\nto answer my connection.\n\n181\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.408\nIf the server is not answering connections\nfor AFP, I'm not gonna connect.\n\n182\n00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:59.500\nIf it's not answering connections\nfrom VNC, I'm not gonna connect.\n\n183\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.800\nIt's gotta get turned\non on the other side.\n\n184\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.080\nSo we are dependent on what\nprotocols the service supports, but\n\n185\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.890\nif the service supports more than one\nprotocol, and we want to know for\n\n186\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.480\na fact that we're using a particular\nprotocol, the best way is to\n\n187\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.720\ngo up here to Go, choose Connect to\nserver, and type in that protocol name.\n\n188\n00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.700\nNow you know exactly which\nprotocol that you're using.\n\n189\n00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.600\nSo Don, how do we configure\nour Mac to be a file server?\n\n190\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.110\nAll right so\nlet's say we wanna be that server, right?\n\n191\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:32.183\nI wanna setup a server and I want to\nsupport AFP and SMB and whatever right?\n\n192\n00:10:32.183 --> 00:10:33.796\nSo I wanna support all\nthese different protocols.\n\n193\n00:10:33.796 --> 00:10:38.766\nWell, this MAC here I'm running MAC OS\n10.13 High Sierra it's a pretty clean\n\n194\n00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:41.535\ninstall I've had a user account for\nmyself and\n\n195\n00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:45.510\nmaybe I've got some folder\nthat I wanna share out, right?\n\n196\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.084\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\ncreate a folder,\n\n197\n00:10:48.084 --> 00:10:50.928\nwhich I'll just call Company Documents,\nright?\n\n198\n00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:54.140\nSo this is gonna be where I\nput my company documents.\n\n199\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.850\nAll sorts of great stuff\nis gonna be in here.\n\n200\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.940\nIt'll be amazing.\n\n201\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.750\nYou guys will see.\nIt should be the greatest, The Greatest.\n\n202\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.420\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat's what's gonna be in there.\n\n203\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.728\nSo I wanna share that out so\npeople can get to it.\n\n204\n00:11:04.728 --> 00:11:07.870\nSo what I'm gonna do is go into\nSystem Preferences and inside of\n\n205\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.470\nSystem Preference, I'm gonna scroll\ndown and find the sharing preference.\n\n206\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.900\nInside of Sharing, here is where\nwe can share our stuff, right?\n\n207\n00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.770\nNow some protocols have their\nown little menu item in here,\n\n208\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:26.250\nbut all the file sharing stuff gets\ngrouped together under one entry.\n\n209\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.690\nThat's just called File Sharing and\nthat's it.\n\n210\n00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.580\nI'm gonna choose File Sharing and\nthen technically all I have to do is check\n\n211\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.850\nthis little box right here and\nit'll turn on File Sharing.\n\n212\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.850\nBut I don't wanna do that just yet.\n\n213\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.480\nBecause there's default\nfiles that are being shared.\n\n214\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.590\nBy default it's gonna\nshare my public folder.\n\n215\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.170\nSo every user account has a public folder.\n\n216\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.440\nMine's Don Pezet's Public Folder.\n\n217\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.350\nWell, I don't use that thing.\n\n218\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.230\nBut it's there by default, right?\n\n219\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.720\nSo I'm gonna take that and\nI'm just gonna get rid of it.\n\n220\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.048\nActually it won't let me get rid\nof it until I add another folder.\n\n221\n00:11:57.048 --> 00:12:00.140\nSo anyhow, so I'm gonna get\nrid of that in just a moment.\n\n222\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.390\nBut then I'm gonna add in, actually wait,\nit is gonna let me remove it.\n\n223\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.940\nI just didn't see the OK prompt there.\n\n224\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.650\nI'll say ok.\nThere we go.\n\n225\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.610\nSo now I'm just gonna add in\nthe folder that I do want to share.\n\n226\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.770\nAnd so, I'm gonna browse into documents,\nand find that company document folder.\n\n227\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.820\nSo, I'm gonna add that.\n\n228\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.770\nAnd then,\n\n229\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.950\non the right side here, I can pick what\npermissions I want people to have.\n\n230\n00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:29.770\nSo, I have read and write, maybe I want\nmy staff to have read and write as well.\n\n231\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.990\nBut everyone else,\nI just want them to have read only, right?\n\n232\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.720\nThey can come in and they can read and see\nwhat's going in there, and that's it, so\n\n233\n00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.520\na much more simplified view.\n\n234\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.100\nAnd they can't actually change\nmy company documents, right?\n\n235\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.418\nSo that's kinda what I want to be set.\n\n236\n00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:49.898\nAll right, next,\nI'm ready to turn on file sharing.\n\n237\n00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:51.487\nWell, almost.\n\n238\n00:12:51.487 --> 00:12:52.440\nAlmost.\n\n239\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.668\nIf you read what it's saying up here,\nit says,\n\n240\n00:12:54.668 --> 00:12:58.295\nFile Sharing allows other users to access\nshared folders on this computer and\n\n241\n00:12:58.295 --> 00:13:00.551\nallows administrators\nto access all volumes.\n\n242\n00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.990\nAll volumes.\n\n243\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.950\nEven though I've only got\none folder listed here,\n\n244\n00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.350\nit is going to allow an administrator\nto access everything.\n\n245\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.510\nThey'll see Macintosh HP, they'll\nbe able to browse in to that drive.\n\n246\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.190\nRight?\nSo\n\n247\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.790\nthere is a little more access\nthan what I'm seeing right here.\n\n248\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:19.000\nThe other thing is you might have noticed\nit doesn't mention protocols at all.\n\n249\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.540\nIf I go under options right here,\nI will see the protocol screen.\n\n250\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.780\nAnd it's asking me do I want to use SMB?\n\n251\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.940\nOr AFP or do I want to use both?\n\n252\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.420\nAll right, well,\nlet's ignore the screen for a minute,\n\n253\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.560\nlet's just pretend that I forgot about\nthat, and I'm gonna turn on file sharing.\n\n254\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.220\nI'm going to hit that\ncheck mark right there,\n\n255\n00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.100\nokay, I get a green light, right here.\n\n256\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.780\nAnd it tells me, now,\nusers can access shared folders,\n\n257\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.418\nadministrators can access all volumes at,\nsmb:// and the IP address of my machine.\n\n258\n00:13:48.418 --> 00:13:49.513\nMm-hm.\n\n259\n00:13:49.513 --> 00:13:51.370\nJust smb.\n\n260\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.790\nSMB is the default.\n\n261\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.690\nAFP is off by default,\nwhich we saw earlier in this episode.\n\n262\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.490\nThat's right.\n\n263\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:02.260\nI'm gonna go to Options, and\nnow I'm gonna check off that AFP.\n\n264\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.650\nNow I'm supporting both.\n\n265\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.390\nI'll do SMB and AFP.\n\n266\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.030\nPeople can connect using either one,\nor maybe I just want AFP and\n\n267\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.840\nI don't want SMB.\n\n268\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.100\nI can turn that one off.\n\n269\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.990\nRight?\nUp to me to pick which one I want.\n\n270\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.760\nNow, in real life I would usually go to\none SMB so that's where I want to be, but\n\n271\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.150\nI'll choose that, all right?\n\n272\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.320\nNow, there is a little warning down\nhere about Windows file sharing,\n\n273\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.510\nwhen Windows clients connect, if they're\nusing the latest version of SMB,\n\n274\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.530\nwhich I think is version 3, there's a type\nof hashing that it does in the password.\n\n275\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.980\nThat if we wanna support that,\nwe've gotta turn it on and\n\n276\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.450\nwe've gotta put in the password for\nthat account here, so that it can\n\n277\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.700\ngenerate the proper hash to match up\nwith that account when it connects.\n\n278\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.820\nIf we don't do this, the machines\nwill fall back to SMB version two.\n\n279\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.490\nThat's fine for most people.\n\n280\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.400\nBut in Windows, an administrator that\nis security conscious might have\n\n281\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.040\nlocked it in to that version 3, and\nthat caused it to fail to connect.\n\n282\n00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.800\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\npunch that in, and say, okay.\n\n283\n00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.710\nAnd so, now that account is present.\n\n284\n00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.200\nIf we were connected to a directory\nserver, this wouldn't be a problem.\n\n285\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.760\nI'm not bound to an active directory or\n\n286\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.325\nopen server, so\nthat's why I have to punch that in.\n\n287\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.940\nAll rright.\nNow that that's done and I can hit done.\n\n288\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.780\nAnd now, I see that it changes.\n\n289\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.140\nSee how it says people can\nconnect using either protocol.\n\n290\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.210\nI'm now a file server right?\n\n291\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.745\nI'm up, I'm supporting regular\nfile connectivity for SMB and AFP.\n\n292\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.570\nOther protocols though like FTP and SFTP,\n\n293\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.060\nthose are actually tied to\nthe remote log in connection here.\n\n294\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.460\nIf I click on remote log in,\nsee over here it says, remote log in lets\n\n295\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.980\nusers of other computers access\nthis computer using SSH and SFTP.\n\n296\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.200\nThat would turn on\nthe Secure File Transfer Protocol,\n\n297\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.070\nif I wanted that I would\njust check off that box and\n\n298\n00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.777\nnow in this case administrator, so we\nwould be allowed to connect up and use it.\n\n299\n00:15:50.777 --> 00:15:53.770\nSame thing goes for screen sharing,\nthe VNC that I mentioned.\n\n300\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.893\nI would have to turn on screen\nsharing in order for that to work.\n\n301\n00:15:56.893 --> 00:16:00.098\nOnce that is specified,\nnow people can connect with it.\n\n302\n00:16:00.098 --> 00:16:03.370\nBut at this point,\nI am now set up as a file server.\n\n303\n00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:08.376\nI am sharing my company\ndocuments folder out, so\n\n304\n00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:14.130\npeople can browse to it, get access to it,\nand start to use my system.\n\n305\n00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.962\n&gt;&gt; Don, how does the system know\nwhich files I want to share though?\n\n306\n00:16:16.962 --> 00:16:19.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, so by default,\nit makes a guess, right?\n\n307\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.300\nSo remember that public folder that\nshowed up, that was the guess.\n\n308\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.030\nIt says, I made this folder for you.\n\n309\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.720\nIt's here, you can use it, right?\n\n310\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.340\nBut after that, it doesn't know.\n\n311\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.420\nIt doesn't know what\nfiles I wanna share out,\n\n312\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.470\nso it's up to me to go in and\nput those in, right?\n\n313\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.860\nAnd I did that with a folder\nin my own account, right?\n\n314\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.484\nI went in to sharing,\nI went into file sharing and\n\n315\n00:16:39.484 --> 00:16:41.790\nI added this company document's folder.\n\n316\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.300\nSo I told it specifically,\nI want to share this folder, right?\n\n317\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.640\nBut if this is gonna be acting like a file\nserver and I've got other folders or\n\n318\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.490\nother drives, I need to come in here and\njust continue adding more things.\n\n319\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.850\nWhen I added that,\nI took the easy route and\n\n320\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.850\nI picked something that was\nin my documents folder.\n\n321\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.890\nIf you're a file server though the odds\nare that you have a second hard drive.\n\n322\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.670\nAnd that second hard drive, it might\nhave other folders and things, and\n\n323\n00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.110\nweird permissions on it.\n\n324\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.040\nSo when you come through here and navigate\nand you pick that other hard drive and\n\n325\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.630\nyou add that folder, it's gonna fix\nthe permissions, get them set up right.\n\n326\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.100\nAnd you'll maintain a permissions list for\neach folder that you share out.\n\n327\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.100\nBut you've got to tell the system that,\nand\n\n328\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.080\non these permissions\nthere's three permissions.\n\n329\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.840\nThere's no access, in other words,\nyou can't get at it.\n\n330\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.120\nThere's read only, you can see what's\nin there but you can't change it.\n\n331\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.240\nAnd then lastly there's read and\nwrite, you can get in there and\n\n332\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.090\nyou change it, modify things,\nadd things, delete,\n\n333\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.660\ndo whatever it is you need to and\nget that kinda put in place.\n\n334\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.280\nBut those are the main ones.\n\n335\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.270\nThere's a couple of special permissions\nthat you might see from time to time,\n\n336\n00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.590\nlike Drop Box.\n\n337\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.890\nDrop Box lets you write a file,\nbut then not read from it.\n\n338\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.090\nIt's a really wierd one, right?\n\n339\n00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And the example I give is,\n\n340\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.030\nwhen I was in college it\nwas pretty common for\n\n341\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.942\na professor to say your term\npaper was due on Friday.\n\n342\n00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:59.400\nBut he didn't really care when you turned\nit in on Friday, you could come up to his\n\n343\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.470\noffice after hours and slide it under\nthe door and he was fine with that, right?\n\n344\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.991\nBasically when I slid that term paper\nunder the door, I had write permissions,\n\n345\n00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:09.459\nI was submitting my paper.\n\n346\n00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:11.244\nBut I didn't have read permissions,\n\n347\n00:18:11.244 --> 00:18:13.430\nI couldn't see it once\nit was under that door.\n\n348\n00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.880\nI couldn't see other student's stuff\nthat they'd slid under the door,\n\n349\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.930\nit was gone to me.\n\n350\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.410\nYou can actually set up a drop\nbox like that in Mac OS and\n\n351\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.310\npeople can drop files into it.\n\n352\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.400\nAnd to them it's then gone but to you,\nyou can see everything that's in there and\n\n353\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.740\naccess it and get at it.\n\n354\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.870\nKind of a neat thing to do.\n\n355\n00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.060\nBut it basically shows up right in there.\n\n356\n00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.700\nGive it your information and\nit's available.\n\n357\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.370\nThat's how we're adding that.\n\n358\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.360\nSome protocols though like SFPT,\nthey relay on SSH and\n\n359\n00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.860\nwhen they connect up you're getting\na shell this tied your user account.\n\n360\n00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.060\nSo it's gonna have whatever access\nyour user account has access too.\n\n361\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.570\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n362\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.900\n&gt;&gt; If your user account has\naccess to the whole hard drive,\n\n363\n00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.490\nthen that's what your gonna have\nwhen you connect with SFTP.\n\n364\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:59.180\nThis is not controlled by\nthe file sharing screen.\n\n365\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.350\nSo that's a difference between the\nprotocols that you'll bump into from time\n\n366\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.890\nto time, is that some protocols have this\nwide ranging reach, other protocols don't.\n\n367\n00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.840\nSo be aware that each one\nbehaves a little bit different.\n\n368\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.000\nAll right, now I've got this\nset up as a file server but\n\n369\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.780\nI haven't actually tested it yet.\n\n370\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.690\nSo let me jump over to my other client,\nthis guy.\n\n371\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.890\nAnd I'm gonna fire up the finder, and\nI'm gonna look at the network and\n\n372\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.350\nI'm gonna find lab client 01, that's\nthe workstation that we just set up.\n\n373\n00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:35.593\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and hit connect as,\n\n374\n00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:42.357\nand when I connect I'm\ngonna login as dpezet,\n\n375\n00:19:42.357 --> 00:19:48.609\nunchain my password, and I will connect.\n\n376\n00:19:48.609 --> 00:19:50.694\nIt's gonna reach out,\nand there's my folders,\n\n377\n00:19:50.694 --> 00:19:52.491\nthere's company documents right there.\n\n378\n00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.720\nNow I don't wanna connect to\ncompany documents just yet\n\n379\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.753\ncuz how do I know which\nprotocol I'm using, right?\n\n380\n00:19:58.753 --> 00:19:59.300\nI don't, not from the screen.\n\n381\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.117\nSo I'm gonna disconnect, right?\n\n382\n00:20:00.117 --> 00:20:00.856\nSo I'm not connected to that system, so\n\n383\n00:20:00.856 --> 00:20:02.224\nwhat we can do is instead of relying on\nthe GUI where we will se the protocol,\n\n384\n00:20:02.224 --> 00:20:04.240\nwe can manually tell the protocol if we go\nand use our well use our Go menu up top.\n\n385\n00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.660\nSo, on my client, I'm gonna go\nback to Go and connect to server.\n\n386\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.510\nAnd, I'm gonna punch in that AFP:// and\nIP address and I will connect, and\n\n387\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.080\nit's gonna reach out and there we go,\nthat's what I was hoping to see.\n\n388\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.320\n&gt;&gt; Ahh Ha\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm connecting up and\n\n389\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.080\nI can see the company documents\nright there, I can browse in and\n\n390\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.585\nthere we go, there's the greatest, so.\n\n391\n00:20:23.585 --> 00:20:26.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I'm seeing is this folder.\n\n392\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.220\nAnd I know it's using AFP because\nI turned off SMB at this point.\n\n393\n00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.480\nIt's the only protocol\nthat it can connect with.\n\n394\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.740\nAnd now I'm in there and we're in\nbusiness for accessing that share.\n\n395\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:42.070\nSo as far as using the GUI,\nwe don't always see what's available or\n\n396\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.660\nwhat protocol we're gonna use because\nIt's trying to hide that from us, and\n\n397\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.780\nthat's where that menu, that connect\nto server comes in really handy.\n\n398\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.170\nSo, at this point,\n\n399\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.020\nany of the folders that I've chosen to\nshare out, I'll see them in that list.\n\n400\n00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.255\nWith AFP,\nI just see it here on the screen.\n\n401\n00:20:59.255 --> 00:21:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; With SMB, I actually got that popup of,\n\n402\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.300\nhere's the list of shares.\n\n403\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which one do you wanna connect to?\n\n404\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.730\nSo it does look a little bit different but\nfor the end user one way or\n\n405\n00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.540\nanother they see the folder they want.\n\n406\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.330\nThey can browse in there, get at it,\nand access their resource.\n\n407\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.330\nNow some of the other protocols like\nSFTP I can't really show you right here.\n\n408\n00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:23.780\nI'd have to go in and download a third\nparty client like Cyber Duck or Filezilla.\n\n409\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.630\nThose are all programs\nthat can connect via SFTP.\n\n410\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.590\nAnd then I can log in and browse\naround the server, and upload files,\n\n411\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.790\ndownload files, and so on.\n\n412\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.250\nThat's all part of just being,\nhaving that remote login turned on.\n\n413\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.240\nSo once you're in business though,\nyou're sharing files, sharing resources.\n\n414\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.720\nThe only real maintenance you have to do\nis updating permissions from time to time.\n\n415\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.695\nYou might want to add or\nremove permissions for a user or a group,\n\n416\n00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:49.070\nas well as adding new folders that you\ncreate and putting those in place.\n\n417\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.760\nAnd that's pretty much it for\nshared files.\n\n418\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.430\nThat's really easy to convert your Mac\nfrom being just a regular old machine\n\n419\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.540\nto being a file server.\n\n420\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.967\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic episode as usual,\nand I just love that Cyber Duck.\n\n421\n00:22:01.967 --> 00:22:05.220\n[LAUGH] And before we move on though,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n422\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.070\n&gt;&gt; One last thing to mention is\nthat if you do zip you Mac up and\n\n423\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.010\na file server,\nTime Machine becomes super mega important.\n\n424\n00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.740\nBecause now,\nnot only can you scrub your files, but\n\n425\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.580\neveryone on the network who has\naccess can scrub your files for you.\n\n426\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.250\nSo that means that the odds of a file\naccidentally being deleted or being\n\n427\n00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.310\ndragged and dropped in the wrong spot are\nmuch, much greater than they were before.\n\n428\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.410\nAnd when somebody's connecting\nover the network and\n\n429\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.840\nthey delete a file,\ndoesn't go to your recycle bin.\n\n430\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.190\nIt just goes away.\n\n431\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.100\nIt disappears.\n\n432\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.240\nSo time machine becomes critical.\n\n433\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.770\nReally important to make sure\nthat you've got that one.\n\n434\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.590\nAnother thing that I want to\nprognosticate just a little bit here.\n\n435\n00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.480\nThere's a lot of rumors right now that\nApple is gonna be killing off AFP.\n\n436\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.210\nThe Apple File Protocol is gonna go away.\n\n437\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.370\nI don't know if that's gonna happen or\nnot.\n\n438\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.540\nRight now they support both.\n\n439\n00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.040\nThey have not announced end of life for\n\n440\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.030\nAFP, so\nI wouldn't worry about it too much.\n\n441\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.650\nBut if you're setting up a brand new\nnetwork, it wouldn't be a bad idea to say,\n\n442\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.320\nlet's standardize on SMB.\n\n443\n00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.270\nApple has already made that change of\nsaying SMB is going to be the default.\n\n444\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.990\nSo that's what it defaults do.\n\n445\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.630\nSo AFP is more than likely on the way out,\n\n446\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.280\nbut they haven't officially\nmade a statement on that.\n\n447\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.260\nSo I just wanted to kinda\nthrow that out there.\n\n448\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Great information, Don.\n\n449\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.670\nThanks very much, and this taping's\nhappening in April 2018, just FYI.\n\n450\n00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.350\nFile sharing, great

00:00:07.213\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:12.312\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n5\n00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.900\nthank you for watching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.430\nI'm your host, Zach Memos as we continue\non with Apple Certified Associate and\n\n7\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.980\nCollaboration Software is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.154\nLet's find out what that means.\n\n9\n00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:26.962\nI'm gonna ask this guy\nright over here Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:30.898\nDon could you help us out?\n&gt;&gt; I sure can Zach because we're\n\n11\n00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.271\ncollaborating.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:34.783\n&gt;&gt; We're working together\n\n13\n00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:35.806\non something.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.236\n&gt;&gt; And with computers back in the olden\n\n15\n00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:43.400\ndays the idea was that it was one person,\none computer doing one thing.\n\n16\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.123\nBut in today's world,\nour computers are all inter connected.\n\n17\n00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:48.062\nWe work together, we exchange information,\n\n18\n00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:50.560\nand we're able to get more done,\nit's teamwork, right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.846\nThere's no I in team and I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; All that stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.080\n&gt;&gt; So point being though,\n\n21\n00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.461\nis that we need software on our systems to\nallow us to communicate with other people,\n\n22\n00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.884\nand that's called collaboration software.\n\n23\n00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:04.442\nAnd Apple has made sure,\nlike most operating system vendors,\n\n24\n00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.628\nthat there's a decent selection of\ncollaboration software that's included\n\n25\n00:01:07.628 --> 00:01:08.800\nwith Mac OS that you can use.\n\n26\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.372\nBut you can always download third\nparty stuff and get it installed,\n\n27\n00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.505\nsome of the first things that\nI install on a new machine.\n\n28\n00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:17.610\nThat allow me to do my normal workflows\nto be able to talk to my team members,\n\n29\n00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.750\nto talk to viewers like you,\nnow I feel like I'm on PBS.\n\n30\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.644\nThis show is brought to\nyou by viewers like you.\n\n31\n00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:24.188\n&gt;&gt; Viewers just like you.\n\n32\n00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:26.091\n&gt;&gt; But to be able to communicate and\n\n33\n00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:27.860\nexchange that information.\n\n34\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.617\nWe're in the communications' age and\nthat's what collaboration software is.\n\n35\n00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:34.271\nSo we're gonna be taking a look at some\nof that software packages with Mac OS\n\n36\n00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:37.000\nright here on this episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well what collaboration\n\n37\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.910\nsoftware is included with Mac OS?\n&gt;&gt; Well there's four main pieces, right?\n\n38\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.415\nAnd Apple has named them\nreally appropriately.\n\n39\n00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:49.050\nRight, so\nthere's an email app they call mail.\n\n40\n00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.626\nThere's a calendar app which they call\ncalendar and there's a contacts app that\n\n41\n00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:54.894\nwhich oddly enough they call contacts.\n&gt;&gt; No kidding!\n\n42\n00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:55.649\n&gt;&gt; I know it's shocking.\n\n43\n00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.469\nAnd each one of these apps are designed\nto manage exactly what their name says,\n\n44\n00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.014\nright so we have an email application\nthat lets us send and receive email.\n\n45\n00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:08.807\nThe official name for it is mail.app\nwhich is actually the file name or\n\n46\n00:02:08.807 --> 00:02:11.120\nthe folder name that it's a part of.\n\n47\n00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.780\nBut it's just the email client\nthat is built into Mac OS,\n\n48\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.410\ninstalled by default it's on every Mac,\nyou have it available just called Mail.\n\n49\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.880\nThe Calendar one, that's for calendaring\nso you can keep track of your own\n\n50\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.400\ncalendar, but you can also connect\nto other people's calendars as well.\n\n51\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.490\nSo you can start planning meetings and\nI can say,\n\n52\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.330\nI wonder if Zach's available next Tuesday,\ninstead of calling him up,\n\n53\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.280\nI can just look at the calendar and see,\nZach is available in the next two days.\n\n54\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.049\nHe's in the studio, can't do a meeting.\n\n55\n00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.580\nSo that's what the Calendar app does.\n\n56\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.210\nAnd then, we've got Contacts.\n\n57\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.801\nWhen you're sending out emails and\nwhen you're scheduling calendar events,\n\n58\n00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.418\nyou need people to be a part of them.\n\n59\n00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:51.661\nThe contacts list, that's like your Use\na little terminology it's your Rolodex,\n\n60\n00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:55.980\nits your collection of contact info to\nbe able to reach out to those people.\n\n61\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.629\nNow there is a fourth application that\nI didn't mention that I wanna mention\n\n62\n00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.234\nat the end which is, used to be called\nmessages now it's called iMessage.\n\n63\n00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:08.060\niMessage is a chat application, but\nit's a lot more than just chat.\n\n64\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.575\nSo it used to easily chat\nbetween users on different Macs,\n\n65\n00:03:11.575 --> 00:03:15.174\nnow it can connect to your iOS device,\nyour iPhone or iPad.\n\n66\n00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:18.684\nAnd you can actually use it\nto send SMS text messages.\n\n67\n00:03:18.684 --> 00:03:23.531\nSo, you can do regular chat and you can do\ntext messages, and you can do chat through\n\n68\n00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:28.460\nApple servers to anyone in the world, so\nit's another great collaboration piece.\n\n69\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.415\nNow, it used to be covered on the exam but\nstarting with the High Sierra exam,\n\n70\n00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:38.536\nstarting with this one, they've eliminated\nall the messaging from the exam.\n\n71\n00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:44.730\nI was about to say I'm not 100% sure\nwhy but I kind of have an idea.\n\n72\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.159\nApple used to have, in their server app,\na chat server, and that chat server would\n\n73\n00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.577\nallow you to basically fire up\nthe messages that connect to it and\n\n74\n00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:56.339\nyou could run your own company's\nchat server and chat rooms, right?\n\n75\n00:03:56.339 --> 00:04:00.544\nThey've eliminated that product it's\nno longer supported inside of the Apple\n\n76\n00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:01.710\nserver app.\n\n77\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.261\nAnd so that's why they removed\nthe messages app from the exam,\n\n78\n00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.809\nit doesn't mean it's not relevant though.\n\n79\n00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.828\nIf you're working in the real world,\n\n80\n00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:13.210\nyou know that messages app is\na pretty big hit with people.\n\n81\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.730\nPeople like the fact that they can\nsend text messages from the phone, but\n\n82\n00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.250\nif they're at the computer, they can just\ndo it right from the computer on a full\n\n83\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.020\nsize keyboard in a much\nbetter environment.\n\n84\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.217\nA lot easier than typing on your phone\nno matter how good you get at that.\n\n85\n00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:29.009\nI mean unless you're like a 15\nyear old then you're amazing\n\n86\n00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.581\nat it but the rest of us.\n&gt;&gt; They have tiny little fingers they can\n\n87\n00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.179\nget in there and mess with stuff [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it is?\n\n88\n00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.744\nAgility and tiny fingers.\n\n89\n00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:36.763\nSo if you've got great but,\n\n90\n00:04:36.763 --> 00:04:41.910\nso be aware that messages really\nwould fall under collaboration.\n\n91\n00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.620\nAny software that lets you\ncommunicate with somebody else,\n\n92\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.480\nthat would be collaboration software.\n\n93\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.772\nAnd obviously, there's a third\nparty list that goes crazy.\n\n94\n00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:54.952\nThings like Skype, FaceTime which\nis also built into MacOS, but\n\n95\n00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:59.545\nnot included as part of what they\nconsider their collaboration suite.\n\n96\n00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:04.270\nCuz FaceTime is not really business ready,\nnot yet, eventually maybe.\n\n97\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.210\nSo, there's no real limit to\nwhat you install yourself, but\n\n98\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.360\nin the exam they really focus on the big\nthree, which is, the mail, calendar and\n\n99\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.950\ncontacts app.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, do we actually configure each\n\n100\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.377\none of these individually?\n&gt;&gt; You can, if you want, you can through\n\n101\n00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:21.910\neach one, and maybe, I don't wanna\nmess with calendar and contacts.\n\n102\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.140\nSo, I can just do mail, right?\n\n103\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.461\nSo, I'm on a Mac here,\nthis is a fresh install of High Sierra.\n\n104\n00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.791\nIn the doc down at the bottom,\nthey've actually had icons for\n\n105\n00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:33.530\na lot of these already in place.\n\n106\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.586\nSo if I look down here at\nthe bottom I've got mail, contacts,\n\n107\n00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:39.857\ncalendar all three right in a row.\n\n108\n00:05:39.857 --> 00:05:41.126\nI didn't put those there,\nthey're there by default.\n\n109\n00:05:41.126 --> 00:05:41.676\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n110\n00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.238\n&gt;&gt; If you've deleted them,\n\n111\n00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:48.140\nwhich I usually do, like on my own\nmachine this is my actual laptop here.\n\n112\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.295\nIf you look at my doc, I've deleted all\nthat stuff out of there to make room.\n\n113\n00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:55.304\nIf you've done that like me,\nyou can just go into your Finder and\n\n114\n00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:58.440\ninto Applications, and\nthey're right in here.\n\n115\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.594\nYou'll find Contacts, Calendar and Mail,\n\n116\n00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:06.992\nif I can master the English alphabet\nthere it is, Mail, so you can find them.\n\n117\n00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:10.192\nAnd in any one of them,\nyou can fire up the application, and\n\n118\n00:06:10.192 --> 00:06:14.800\nif it's your first time launching, it's\ngonna see that you don't have an account,\n\n119\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.620\nand it's gonna walk you through\nthat set up to get it configured.\n\n120\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.344\nAnd so, you can configure\njust that individual one.\n\n121\n00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:23.980\nIf I were to first up the calendar,\nI'd get the same basic thing.\n\n122\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.255\nHere it's asking me to continue and\ngo in and\n\n123\n00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:26.709\nconfigure my calendar\nunder calendar settings.\n\n124\n00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:30.390\nSo we can do it individually,\nbut we don't normally.\n\n125\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.290\nNormally we can configure\nthem all at the same time.\n\n126\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:40.556\nIf you go into your System Preferences and\nyou go into Internet Accounts, right here.\n\n127\n00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:45.220\nMail, contacts, calendar,\nthey're all considered internet accounts.\n\n128\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.025\nSo they come along with\nyour internet settings.\n\n129\n00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:53.014\nAnd if you're using iCloud, then you're\nprobably already connected for Contact,\n\n130\n00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:57.200\nCalender and Mail all via iCloud,\nthat functionality is there.\n\n131\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.492\nLet's see, did I sign into iCloud?\n\n132\n00:06:58.492 --> 00:07:02.270\nI don't think I did, no,\nlet me go to my actual laptop.\n\n133\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.321\nI'm signed into iCloud here.\n\n134\n00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:09.160\nAnd if I bring that up on the screen,\nso here's my my iCloud connection, and\n\n135\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.480\nsee how it's got a Mail,\nContacts, Calendars?\n\n136\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.157\nAnd I've got them all turned off, and\n\n137\n00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:17.107\nthat's because I don't use\niCloud's collaboration services.\n\n138\n00:07:17.107 --> 00:07:19.351\nBut if I did, if those were checked off,\n\n139\n00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:23.839\njust signing into iCloud would configure\nall three of those automatically, and\n\n140\n00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:27.170\nwhen I launch my mail,\nI would have my iCloud email.\n\n141\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.509\nIf I launch my calendar, it'd be\nthe calendar that's stored in iCloud and\n\n142\n00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:32.582\nsame thing with contact\nit would all be there.\n\n143\n00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:35.496\nNow, I don't use them\nbecause here at ITProTV,\n\n144\n00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:38.632\nwe use a service called Office 365,\nMicrosoft.\n\n145\n00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:41.380\nSo they give us contacts, calendar and\n\n146\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.911\nmail all through Office 365.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n147\n00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.482\n&gt;&gt; I don't use it with iCloud,\n\n148\n00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:49.260\nif I had it turned on,\nI'd run the risk of mixing things up.\n\n149\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.744\nMaybe I'd add something to my iCloud\ncalendar instead of my Office 365 calendar\n\n150\n00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:54.520\nby accident.\n\n151\n00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.657\nAnd now I miss a meeting or\n\n152\n00:07:55.657 --> 00:07:58.757\nsomething of that nature that's\nthe kind problem that can happen.\n\n153\n00:07:58.757 --> 00:08:03.345\nSo, that's why I'm not using it I don't\nhave it set up that way I might have to go\n\n154\n00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:07.750\nin and set them up individually, or I\nmight be able to set them up all at once.\n\n155\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.548\nAnd if we go back here to\nour System Preferences and\n\n156\n00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:12.213\nyou go to Internet Accounts,\n\n157\n00:08:12.213 --> 00:08:16.410\nwhen you go to Add an account,\nit's got a list of things over here.\n\n158\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.050\nSome of these are combos, right?\n\n159\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.123\nLike Exchange and iCloud,\nif I pick those, that will have contact,\n\n160\n00:08:24.123 --> 00:08:27.977\ncalendar and\nmail all rolled together, all right.\n\n161\n00:08:27.977 --> 00:08:31.266\nBut if I go down to the bottom here and\nchoose add other account,\n\n162\n00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:35.330\nnow I can add in something and\nI'm having to tell it exactly what it is.\n\n163\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.880\nIs it a mail account?\n\n164\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.600\nIs it a calendar account?\n\n165\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.960\nIs it a contact account?\n\n166\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.300\nCalendar is usually called CalDav and\ncontacts are CardDav.\n\n167\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.450\nDav is distributed authoring and\nversioning,\n\n168\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.684\nit's protocol that lets you upload and\ndownload data from the server.\n\n169\n00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:55.270\nAnd so that would be me adding individual\ncalendar or individual contact support.\n\n170\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.180\nSo, I certainly can do that but\ntypically, we're gonna try and\n\n171\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.870\ndo it all together at the same\ntime that's usually what we\n\n172\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.380\nwanna do.\n&gt;&gt; Now what is an example of a pretty\n\n173\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.900\nstandard configuration?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if we wanna go standard,\n\n174\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.375\nthings like, well,\nlet's take email as an example, right?\n\n175\n00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:17.429\nIn the email world, there's tons of\nproprietary email formats that are out\n\n176\n00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:21.311\nthere, like with the iCloud email,\nor Google's Gmail, or whatever.\n\n177\n00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.720\nWhere they want you to use\na webpage to get at, right?\n\n178\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.045\nThat's not standard, that's unique\nto them that's their webpage.\n\n179\n00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:30.531\nBut there are email\nprotocols that are tried and\n\n180\n00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:32.920\ntrue that have been around a long time.\n\n181\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.280\nIn the email world there's two big ones,\nPOP 3 and iMap4 right?\n\n182\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.684\nPOP 3 are the Post Office Protocol\nversion 3 was one of the original\n\n183\n00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:46.942\nemail protocols that let you\nreceive email and it's very basic.\n\n184\n00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:48.866\nIt doesn't have a ton of features and\n\n185\n00:09:48.866 --> 00:09:51.359\nthat's why most people\ndon't use it anymore.\n\n186\n00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:53.806\niMap which the Internet Messaging and\n\n187\n00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:57.500\nsomething Protocol I can't\nremember what the A is.\n\n188\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.439\nBut anyhow, Internet Messaging and\nAccess Protocol,\n\n189\n00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:05.220\nwhat it lets you do is\nreceiving mail just like POP 3.\n\n190\n00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.912\nBut it has advanced functionality\nit does things like folders, so\n\n191\n00:10:07.912 --> 00:10:10.938\nyou can actually have folders you can\nmark an email as read you don't have to\n\n192\n00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:12.830\ndownload an email you\ncan just get its header.\n\n193\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.922\nIt's got a lot of advanced functionality,\nand so iMap is still very popular,\n\n194\n00:10:16.922 --> 00:10:21.138\nin fact services like gmail and iCloud\nwhere they have a proprietary interface,\n\n195\n00:10:21.138 --> 00:10:24.063\nthey normally have iMap support\non the backend as well.\n\n196\n00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:26.885\nAnd that way you can connect and\nget at your mail via iMap, so\n\n197\n00:10:26.885 --> 00:10:29.710\nthat would be considered\na standard connection.\n\n198\n00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.680\nBut iMap is just for receiving,\nthen there's sending email.\n\n199\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.659\nSending email there's really just\none protocol for sending email and\n\n200\n00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:40.032\nthat's SMTP, or\nthe Simple Message Transport Protocol or\n\n201\n00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:42.510\nSimple Mail Transport Protocol.\n\n202\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.260\nAnd it's designed for\nsending email and everybody uses that.\n\n203\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.380\nThey have to because otherwise\nhow would we exchange email.\n\n204\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.560\nThe systems have to be able\nto talk to each other.\n\n205\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.070\nAnd SMTP has been a standard for\na very, very long time.\n\n206\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.280\nBoth of these have been around for\nalmost 30 years now.\n\n207\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.920\nSo those are pretty standard protocols.\n\n208\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.877\nIf you've got an iMap server and\nan SMTP server,\n\n209\n00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:03.123\nadding them in is very easy, right?\n\n210\n00:11:03.123 --> 00:11:05.283\nBut it is just email,\nit doesn't do contacts and\n\n211\n00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:07.298\ncalendar we'd have to\nadd them in separate.\n\n212\n00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:09.880\nSo let's say I wanted to go that route.\n\n213\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.060\nI could go into Internet accounts and\nit's asking me, am I doing iCloud or\n\n214\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.860\nExchange or whatever.\n\n215\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.780\nThese will be my easy buttons, right?\n\n216\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.060\nBut they're proprietary,\nthey're tied to those services.\n\n217\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.530\nSo I'm gonna scroll down\nto the bottom here and\n\n218\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.110\nI'm gonna tell it that I'm going\nto add a Mail account, all right?\n\n219\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:30.840\nAnd when I add a mail account, it's going\nto try and figure out my account for me.\n\n220\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.800\nSo if I punch in my username and\nmy password, it's gonna look out there and\n\n221\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.380\nsay, can I figure out how this is set up?\n\n222\n00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.833\nAnd you'd be surprised,\na lot of times it can.\n\n223\n00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.904\nI'm gonna use a demo account\nthat we have here that we use in\n\n224\n00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.800\nsome of our Office Pro shows.\n\n225\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.615\nThis one is gonna Joey Fatone.\n&gt;&gt; Good old\n\n226\n00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:50.231\nJoey.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n227\n00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:53.745\n[LAUGH] let's see if I can\nremember this whole one here.\n\n228\n00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:58.771\nSo let's see, it's officeprodemocode.com,\n\n229\n00:11:58.771 --> 00:12:02.128\nand I will punch in his password.\n\n230\n00:12:02.128 --> 00:12:06.724\nAnd what's gonna happen is,\nit's going to try and figure out,\n\n231\n00:12:06.724 --> 00:12:09.740\nokay, how does Joey's email work?\n\n232\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.391\nAnd it's gonna try iMap, it's gonna try\nPOP3, it's gonna try a few different ones\n\n233\n00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:16.989\nand see what it can find,\nand so it reached out.\n\n234\n00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:20.390\nIt took that email address and\nit's trying to contact the server and\n\n235\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.480\nit failed it didn't work, okay.\n\n236\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.530\nThat's actually not uncommon.\n\n237\n00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.850\nIt's hard to figure out what\nsomebody's mail server is, and\n\n238\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.370\nit tries to do it securely.\n\n239\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.703\nIt doesn't just want to throw out some\npassword across the internet unencrypted\n\n240\n00:12:32.703 --> 00:12:34.280\nthat's what makes guessing so hard.\n\n241\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.780\nSo we're normally gonna have\nto tell it what we've got.\n\n242\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.353\nFor example in my case, Joey's user\nname is actually his email address so\n\n243\n00:12:41.353 --> 00:12:43.802\nI need to copy that and post it in there.\n\n244\n00:12:43.802 --> 00:12:47.182\nI need to put in this password,\nwhich I'm pretty sure I typed right,\n\n245\n00:12:47.182 --> 00:12:48.680\nthen the account type.\n\n246\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.250\nIs it iMap or is it POP?\n\n247\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.160\nNow notice,\nit doesn't show a version number, and\n\n248\n00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.460\nthat's because iMap 4 is really\nold nobody runs iMap 3 or 2 or 1.\n\n249\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.281\nIt's always on iMap4 these days Same\nthing with POP, it's always POP 3,\n\n250\n00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:01.366\nPOP 3 is really old.\n\n251\n00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:05.689\nI was using POP 3 over 20 years ago,\nit is not changed there is no POP 4.\n\n252\n00:13:05.689 --> 00:13:08.570\nSo it's just asking to pick that protocol.\n\n253\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.830\nThen the incoming and\nthe outgoing mail server right?\n\n254\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.970\nWhat mail server is it that we're\ngoing to be connecting to and\n\n255\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.200\nthat's part of what it tried to discover,\nand it wasn't able to discover it.\n\n256\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.090\nSo, this is where you go to your network\nadministrator, your system admin.\n\n257\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.347\nAnd you say what mail\nservers am I supposed to use?\n\n258\n00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:29.059\nAnd so in this case we're supposed to\n\n259\n00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:33.780\nuse outlook.office365.com.\n\n260\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:41.193\nAnd for\nthe outgoing it's smtp.office365.com.\n\n261\n00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:45.128\nThose are the mil severs that that's\nattached to, and I can hit Sign in and\n\n262\n00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:49.148\nit's gonna reach out and try and connect\nto that server and see if it works.\n\n263\n00:13:49.148 --> 00:13:52.753\nNow if I got the server name wrong, or if\nI got the password wrong, then I'm gonna\n\n264\n00:13:52.753 --> 00:13:55.581\nfind out, but in my case I got them right.\n&gt;&gt; All right!\n\n265\n00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:56.124\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n266\n00:13:56.124 --> 00:13:59.090\nit's offering to configure mail and notes.\n\n267\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.340\nNow notes are tricky cuz they look\nlike they're something special,\n\n268\n00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.620\nnotes are just emails.\n\n269\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.910\nThey're emails that are just\nhidden into a different folder, so\n\n270\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.770\nit's not really anything special so it's\ngonna configure both of them to use that.\n\n271\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:14.180\nAnd when I say Done, I've now got\nan email account set up, right?\n\n272\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.780\nAnd now that it's set up I can go and\nfire up that mail application and\n\n273\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:24.916\nit's gonna launch, and it's gonna connect\nto that server, and here come my emails.\n\n274\n00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:27.513\nJustin Timberlake has sent me an email,\nthat's very special.\n\n275\n00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:28.353\n&gt;&gt; Justin likes you.\n\n276\n00:14:28.353 --> 00:14:30.310\n&gt;&gt; So there we go, I got an email.\n\n277\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.898\nI'm in my system,\nthe mail app is now working,\n\n278\n00:14:32.898 --> 00:14:35.439\nthat's a pretty standard\nsetup right there.\n\n279\n00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:38.356\nObviously username and\npassword will be unique to you,\n\n280\n00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:41.050\nthe server names may be\nunique to you as well.\n\n281\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.794\nAnd there are some other settings\nthat might have to be tweaked.\n\n282\n00:14:44.794 --> 00:14:48.994\nIf we start noticing weird behavior, or\nif our email doesn't quite come down and\n\n283\n00:14:48.994 --> 00:14:50.800\nyou can go into your preferences.\n\n284\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.060\nSo if I go into Mail and\nPreferences I'm sorry not preferences,\n\n285\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.180\nactually this will work,\nI need to go to Accounts.\n\n286\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.140\nI could have gone to mail and\naccounts, but if you go to the wrong\n\n287\n00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.520\nplace like me and go mail preferences,\naccounts is just this tab right here.\n\n288\n00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.530\nAnd I can view that account, and\n\n289\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.430\nfrom here you can go into Server settings,\nand you can tweak things in here.\n\n290\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.615\nSome settings might need to be adjusted\nsee how it's got Advanced iMap settings.\n\n291\n00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:19.786\nIf you choose that there's a few more\nsettings you can specify that have to do\n\n292\n00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:23.503\nwith security if you want to do\ncertificate based authentication or\n\n293\n00:15:23.503 --> 00:15:25.408\nif you wanna turn off encryption.\n\n294\n00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:28.358\nAnd say I'll allow an insecure\nconnection which is\n\n295\n00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:29.441\na terrible idea.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:30.433\n&gt;&gt; You can tweak that if need be so\n\n297\n00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:33.080\nif you're having problems connecting\nyou might need to do that.\n\n298\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.070\nBut otherwise Apple does a really good job\nof figuring out what those settings should\n\n299\n00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.560\nbe and getting them put in place.\n\n300\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.490\nIt says automatically\nmanaged connection settings.\n\n301\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.130\nIf you uncheck that,\n\n302\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.460\nyou'll see even more things like\nthe ability to change the port.\n\n303\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.979\nRight now for iMap I'm using port 143,\nand that's fine but\n\n304\n00:15:50.979 --> 00:15:55.939\nport 143 can usually do encrypted and\nunencrypted connections.\n\n305\n00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:59.980\nSo a lot of administrators will have you\nchange that and they'll say you know what,\n\n306\n00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.204\nI need you to use 993.\n\n307\n00:16:01.204 --> 00:16:06.651\n993 is IMAP as well, but\nit only does encrypted connections.\n\n308\n00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:07.650\nIt doesn't do decrypted.\n\n309\n00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.045\nThat way, you know you're\nconnecting with encryption.\n\n310\n00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:13.040\nSame thing for SMTP.\n\n311\n00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.630\nSMTP defaults to port 25.\n\n312\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.610\nAnd if I scroll down, it's just\noff the bottom of my screen there,\n\n313\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:25.060\nyou can sort of see it down\nhere where it's using port 587.\n\n314\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.713\nPort 25 can do encrypted and unencrypted.\n\n315\n00:16:28.713 --> 00:16:30.410\n587 will always do encrypted.\n\n316\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.590\nSo that's a good way to check and\n\n317\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.287\nmake sure that that's set\nthe way that you want it.\n\n318\n00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:37.940\nAnd we can save it, and now I know that\nI'm going to be connecting that way.\n\n319\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.250\nSo there's plenty of other settings\nwe can tweak in there, but\n\n320\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.240\nthat's a pretty standard example of how to\nset up an email account and get connected.\n\n321\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.300\nSetting up a calendar or a contacts\naccount would be the same basic way.\n\n322\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.750\nI could go into those apps and\nchoose to add that service, or\n\n323\n00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.480\nI could do it through the system\npreferences in internet accounts and\n\n324\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.095\nget it put in place.\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, are the proprietary mail\n\n325\n00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:59.396\nservers easier or harder to set up?\n&gt;&gt; Those are actually\n\n326\n00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:00.090\neasier.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n327\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:00.966\n&gt;&gt; You hear proprietary and\n\n328\n00:17:00.966 --> 00:17:01.970\nthat makes it sound harder.\n\n329\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.190\nThose are easier cuz it does\neverything all at once, right?\n\n330\n00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.120\nLet me dig this account out, and so\nI'm just going to go in here and\n\n331\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.070\nremove the account, or actually I'm not,\ncuz it's off the bottom of my screen.\n\n332\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.830\nLet me go out to my System Preference.\n\n333\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.050\nI'll do it from here.\n\n334\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.270\nSo I'm going to remove that account,\nand we'll just get rid of that.\n\n335\n00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.251\nThere you go, so\nI'm back to having nothing, right?\n\n336\n00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:24.260\nWell, you probably noticed the servers I\nwas connecting to there were Office 365.\n\n337\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.290\nAnd with Microsoft,\nthey provide the contact, calendar and\n\n338\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.004\nemail all in one service.\n\n339\n00:17:30.004 --> 00:17:34.530\nAnd Office 365 is really just\na managed Microsoft Exchange Server.\n\n340\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.385\nExchange would be like if you\nhad your own private Office 365.\n\n341\n00:17:37.385 --> 00:17:41.390\nOffice 365 itself would be the public one,\nthe one that's out on the Internet.\n\n342\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.640\nSo I can actually choose Exchange, and\n\n343\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.090\nit's gonna ask me to punch in\nmy information for that account.\n\n344\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.576\nAnd so, I can punch in who I am.\n\n345\n00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:52.555\nI'm pretending to be Joey.\n&gt;&gt; There goes Joey again.\n\n346\n00:17:52.555 --> 00:17:53.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And,\n\n347\n00:17:53.597 --> 00:17:57.370\nI gotta spell this right or\nthe whole thing breaks down.\n\n348\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:04.723\nSo that is officeprodemoco.com,\nand I'll punch in his password.\n\n349\n00:18:04.723 --> 00:18:08.727\nAnd it's going to reach out and\ntry and connect, but\n\n350\n00:18:08.727 --> 00:18:12.555\nthis time it knows more\nthan what I gave it before.\n\n351\n00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:14.875\nBefore, it was just trying to\ndiscover it without knowing anything.\n\n352\n00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:18.712\nNow it knows, you're trying to\nconnect to an exchange server.\n\n353\n00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:23.092\nSo I'm expecting certain protocols\nto connect certain ways, and\n\n354\n00:18:23.092 --> 00:18:24.862\nI should be able to talk to that server.\n\n355\n00:18:24.862 --> 00:18:26.942\nAnd see how I didn't get\na warning this time?\n\n356\n00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:29.222\nIt didn't say, I can't verify the account.\n\n357\n00:18:29.222 --> 00:18:31.142\nI didn't have to come in and\ntype in more data.\n\n358\n00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:32.832\nIt just says, yep, I talked to it.\n\n359\n00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:38.738\nI'm gonna set up Mail, Contacts, Calendar,\nReminders, Notes, all of this at once.\n\n360\n00:18:38.738 --> 00:18:43.790\nAnd that would have happened if I chose\niCloud, or if I chose Google, the Gmail.\n\n361\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.460\nIt sets up all these at once.\n\n362\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.450\nAnd when I say Done, it adds them.\n\n363\n00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.500\nAll those services are now configured.\n\n364\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.000\nAnd so, if I launch my Mail app,\nit's going to come up.\n\n365\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.440\nThere's my email.\n\n366\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.240\nSo I've got it in place, it's ready to go.\n\n367\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.680\nI can fire up my Calendar, and\nmy calendar will now be populated.\n\n368\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.146\nLet me just Continue there.\n\n369\n00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:06.656\nThere we go.\n\n370\n00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:12.350\nSo my calendar's populated, which, let's\nsee, I'm really just seeing holidays here.\n\n371\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.790\nThat's not very exciting.\n\n372\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.730\nWhere is Joey's calendar?\n\n373\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.880\nHas it not loaded yet?\n\n374\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.379\nSometimes it takes a moment\nto load the first time.\n\n375\n00:19:19.379 --> 00:19:22.743\nWhen you fire up your Calendar app,\na lot of times you're seeing your\n\n376\n00:19:22.743 --> 00:19:26.860\nlocal calendars, and you might not\nsee your company calendars just yet.\n\n377\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.750\nI'm going to, well actually, this section\nright here says Exchange, and I'm seeing\n\n378\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.501\nsome of these different calendars like\nthe Tampa Bay Lightening hockey schedules.\n\n379\n00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:35.870\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's important.\n\n380\n00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.872\n&gt;&gt; If we're seeing that,\n\n381\n00:19:37.872 --> 00:19:39.578\nthen, there we go.\n\n382\n00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.002\nYou know what, I might just have\nto turn some of these off and\n\n383\n00:19:42.002 --> 00:19:44.020\nback on again to get them to show up.\n\n384\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.120\nBut yeah, I can see\na Tampa Bay Lightning games right there.\n\n385\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.050\nApparently, Joey Fatone is a-\n&gt;&gt; He's a big\n\n386\n00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.850\nfan.\n&gt;&gt; Lightning Fan.\n\n387\n00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.930\n&gt;&gt; He is a fan.\n\n388\n00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.060\n&gt;&gt; I don't know much about old Joey.\n\n389\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.620\nSo [LAUGH], but if I go through here and\nkind of scroll back through the months,\n\n390\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.470\nI can start to see other\ncalendar items popping up.\n\n391\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.760\nNot just hockey games, I imagine.\n\n392\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.400\nSee how far back we can go here.\n\n393\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.740\nBut these are all different\nthings that are a part of.\n\n394\n00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.487\nLook here,\nhe's got dance practice, and some-\n\n395\n00:20:11.487 --> 00:20:12.830\n&gt;&gt; He's just started taking tap.\n\n396\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.560\n&gt;&gt; Kimba Cat has a birthday, apparently.\n\n397\n00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.600\nI don't know who Kimba Cat is,\nbut there they are.\n\n398\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.040\nSo we start to see that calendar\nitem all populated here.\n\n399\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.426\nLet's see if he's got any contacts, since\nwe're messing with his account anyway.\n\n400\n00:20:25.426 --> 00:20:29.050\nSo I'm gonna go into his Contact list,\nand maybe the whole band will be there.\n\n401\n00:20:30.051 --> 00:20:31.647\nMy goodness, it is.\n&gt;&gt; It is?\n\n402\n00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And even more,\n\n403\n00:20:33.028 --> 00:20:35.831\nDebbie Gibson is in here.\n&gt;&gt; I love the Debbie Gibson.\n\n404\n00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:37.240\nMy-\n&gt;&gt; debbie@lostinyoureyes.com.\n\n405\n00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.720\nWho set this thing up?\n\n406\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.345\nSo I'm using someone else's\ndemo account here, and\n\n407\n00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:43.571\nthis is the first time\nI'm seeing some of it.\n\n408\n00:20:43.571 --> 00:20:45.415\nThat is really, really entertaining.\n\n409\n00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:46.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty funny stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:46.932 --> 00:20:47.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All\n\n411\n00:20:47.634 --> 00:20:48.327\nright.\n&gt;&gt; I think I know who put this together.\n\n412\n00:20:48.327 --> 00:20:50.520\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm in here.\n\n413\n00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.480\nHow does that even happen?\n\n414\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.252\nAll right, so anyhow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.065\n&gt;&gt; So there's a lot of stuff in here,\n\n416\n00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:55.760\nreally cool.\n\n417\n00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.903\nThe point is, this is all automatic.\n\n418\n00:20:56.903 --> 00:21:00.305\nSo the proprietary systems are almost\nbetter, and they are better, in a way.\n\n419\n00:21:00.305 --> 00:21:01.438\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty simple.\n\n420\n00:21:01.438 --> 00:21:03.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is, it's dead simple.\n\n421\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.900\nAll the stuff gets set up,\n\n422\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.270\nit's all in place.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n423\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.280\nnow we're ready to rock.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n424\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.560\nAnother wonderful episode,\nwhich I enjoyed very much.\n\n425\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.220\nCollaboration software.\n\n426\n00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.440\nAnd I think you need to\nsay a few more things.\n\n427\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like I need to send Debbie Gibson\n\n428\n00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:17.511\nan email.\n\n429\n00:21:17.511 --> 00:21:18.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.650\n&gt;&gt; Or Joey.\n\n431\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.076\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna have that song stuck\nin my head the rest of the day now.\n\n432\n00:21:21.076 --> 00:21:22.661\n&gt;&gt; Go tap dancing with Joey, I don't know.\n\n433\n00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:24.301\n&gt;&gt; All right, one big thing I want to\n\n434\n00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:28.521\nthrow out here is that if you're studying\nfor the ACA, the Apple Certified Associate\n\n435\n00:21:28.521 --> 00:21:31.760\nexam, you need to know basically\nwhat I just showed you, right?\n\n436\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.880\nAbout the Mail, Contact and Calendar app,\nbasically how to add an account.\n\n437\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.153\nIt's not rocket science,\nit's pretty cut and dry.\n\n438\n00:21:37.153 --> 00:21:40.380\nOnce you get out there in the real world,\nthough, things change a lot.\n\n439\n00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.680\nSo, for example,\n\n440\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.230\nFantastical is a third-party calendar\napp that a lot of Apple users love.\n\n441\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.720\nI use it myself, really good product.\n\n442\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.220\nObviously not gonna be on the exam.\n\n443\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.200\nOn the email side,\nmost people have moved to web-based email.\n\n444\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.330\nSo we don't need to add the account here.\n\n445\n00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:01.200\nIf I'm using Google, or iCloud, or Office\n365, we just use the web-based email.\n\n446\n00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.830\nWe don't even use the client here.\n\n447\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.790\nSo, understand that in the real\nworld you've got tons of options,\n\n448\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.140\ntons of different ways\nof accessing this stuff.\n\n449\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.300\nBut on the exam, they want to focus on\nthe products that are built into Mac OS.\n\n450\n00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:18.080\nNow I do know some people that absolutely\nlove the Mail app that's a part of Mac OS.\n\n451\n00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.520\nI'm not one of those people, but\n\n452\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.960\nI do know others that are.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n453\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.280\n&gt;&gt; So you may well use it and love it.\n\n454\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.910\nAnd that's cool, good for you.\n\n455\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.130\nBut just know that there are other\noptions that are out there.\n\n456\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.020\nSome are better,\n\n457\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.180\nsome are worse, it just kind of depends.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome information and well delivered.\n\n458\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.428\nThank you very much Don, and\n\n459\n00:22:34.428 --> 00:22:37.657\nmake sure you watch everything in\nthe Apple Certified Associate Series.\n\n460\n00:22:37.657 --> 00:22:38.850\nYou're gonna be very glad you did.\n\n461\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.690\nIt's gonna help you now and in the future.\n\n462\n00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.900\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\n\n463\n00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.349\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n464\n00:22:45.349 --> 00:22:46.650\nSo check those out as well.\n\n465\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.431\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n466\n00:22:49.431 --> 00:22:50.780\nYou know, ITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n467\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.070\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n468\n00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.556\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n469\n00:22:54.556 --> 00:23:01.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n470\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.211\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:07.628\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:12.062\nwatching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:16.290\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.160\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this\nepisode of Apple certified associates.\n\n7\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160\nAnd Security Features is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.300\nNow who can give us\nthe information we need?\n\n9\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.680\nI there he is it's Don Pezet right\nover here, Don good to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.140\n&gt;&gt; Hey glad to be back Zach and\n\n11\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.930\nin this episode like you said we're going\nto take a look at security features.\n\n12\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.630\nThere's actually a ton of security\nfeatures that we need to cover.\n\n13\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.610\nA lot of stuff that's built into Mac OS\nthat If we know about it, if we configure\n\n14\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.340\nit, if we use it properly and really\nmake the environment very very secure.\n\n15\n00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.690\nAlthough the reality is even if you don't\nknow about some of this stuff it's already\n\n16\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.940\na fairly secure system.\n\n17\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.400\nApple has made great strides into\nmaking sure that everything is there,\n\n18\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.180\nyour data is protected, you are protected.\n\n19\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.040\nBut as an Apple certified associate,\n\n20\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.380\nwe have to actually demonstrate that\nwe have knowledge in each of those.\n\n21\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.260\nSo, in this episode and\n\n22\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.290\nit's more than one I'll be able\nto get through in one episode.\n\n23\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.130\nBut in those series of those,\nwe're gonna see all those features that\n\n24\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.750\nare baked in MacOS and get an idea of what\nis there that we can use to protect our\n\n25\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.400\ndata and our information.\n&gt;&gt; Are there broad categories of\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.260\nsecurity features?\n\n27\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.790\nOr are they all unique?\n&gt;&gt; Apple kind of divides them up into two\n\n28\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.780\ncategories, right?\n\n29\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.660\nSo there's system managed\nsecurity features.\n\n30\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.720\nAnd then there's user\nmanaged security features.\n\n31\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.440\nOn the system manged side,\nthose are ones that Apple developed them,\n\n32\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.390\nthey've baked into the operating system.\n\n33\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.930\nAnd they're turned on by default,\nfor the most part.\n\n34\n00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.670\nWe don't have to worry about configuring\nthem, we don't even necessarily see them.\n\n35\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.770\nThey kind of just hiding there in\nthe background, protecting us day in and\n\n36\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.290\nday out,\nwe don't even know that they're there.\n\n37\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.480\nThat's the system manage side.\n\n38\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.110\nThe user manage side though,\nthat's different, that's up to us.\n\n39\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.620\nWe have to one, know the feature exist,\ntwo turn it on and\n\n40\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.790\nthree turn it on the right way.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.100\n&gt;&gt; It's not just flipping a switch.\n\n42\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.690\nIt is usually some kind of\nconfiguration that goes along side it.\n\n43\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.180\nThe system manage stuff everybody\nuses those, they work great.\n\n44\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.820\nThe user managed stuff those are parts\nwhere Apple said, boy we know we could\n\n45\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.040\nmake this more secure but we don't know\nhow you're going to use your computer.\n\n46\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.600\nOnly you know how you're\ngonna use your computer, so\n\n47\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.740\nwe have to leave it up to\nyou to configure that.\n\n48\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.820\nSo in this series,\nwe'll get a chance to see some of those.\n\n49\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.370\nAnd that's that big differentiator\nbetween them, is whether or\n\n50\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.310\nnot you've gotta configure them or not.\n&gt;&gt; Well what is an example of assistant\n\n51\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420\nmanaged security feature?\n&gt;&gt; All right, probably one of the best\n\n52\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.130\nexamples of assistant managed security\nfeature is application sandboxing.\n\n53\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.890\nThat when you run\nan application on Mac OS,\n\n54\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.720\nthe odds are it's gonna\nrun inside of a sandbox.\n\n55\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.381\nAnd the reason I say the odds are is that\nsandboxing was a feature introduced,\n\n56\n00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.084\nI believe it was in Mac OS 10.9.\n\n57\n00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:48.400\nIt might have been 10.8.\n\n58\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.840\nBut if you're running a really\nold version of Mac OS,\n\n59\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.480\nthen it didn't have that sandboxing.\n\n60\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.715\nBut in newer versions, it does and\nmost of us should be on 10.13.\n\n61\n00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:55.687\nBut, at this point,\n\n62\n00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:59.800\nmaybe you're on something newer depending\non when you're watching this show.\n\n63\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.550\nSo every application you run should\nbe sandboxed to some extent.\n\n64\n00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.880\nWhat happens is when you download\nan app from the app store.\n\n65\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.030\nApple steps in and says, we're gonna\nlimit what that app is allowed to do.\n\n66\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.770\nThe app is going to run\ninside of a sandbox,\n\n67\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.090\ninside of a little walled environment\nsimply called a walled garden.\n\n68\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.880\nWhere the application can only\naccess things that we want it to.\n\n69\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.700\nThat it's intended to access.\n\n70\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.920\nOne application is not\nallowed to reach over and\n\n71\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.570\ninterfere with another application.\n\n72\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.780\nSo, if you think about like, ransomware.\n\n73\n00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.010\nRansomware is a virus or\nmalicious software that gets installed.\n\n74\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.710\nAnd then it encrypts\neverything on your hard drive.\n\n75\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.830\nWell, a normal application doesn't need\nto access everything on your hard drive.\n\n76\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.470\nA normal application just needs\nto access it's preferences,\n\n77\n00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.150\nmaybe the documents that it saves,\nand that's it.\n\n78\n00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.950\nThe reason ransomware and\nthe reason viruses are so\n\n79\n00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.010\neffective is that they're accessing\nway more than they should.\n\n80\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.450\nWell, with a sandbox, it prevents that.\n\n81\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.050\nIt says hey, Ransomware can get installed.\n\n82\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.580\nBut if it tries to access things\noutside of its own little boundaries.\n\n83\n00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.210\nIt gets blocked, it stops,\nso it encrypt itself.\n\n84\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.530\nBut that's about it, right?\n\n85\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.800\nThat's protection.\n\n86\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.160\nAnd we don't have to turn that on\napplication sunboxing is on ny default.\n\n87\n00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.920\nIt's built into MacOS and where every\napp from the app store being sunbox.\n\n88\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.820\nAnd for some of the apps that you're\ngetting from third parties that are sunbox\n\n89\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.697\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n90\n00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:24.917\nwhat about the applications\nthat do come with MacOS?\n\n91\n00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:25.550\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n92\n00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.600\nso this is where things get a little bit\nweird because I mentioned like apps to\n\n93\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.100\ncome from the app store.\n\n94\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.970\nBut not every app comes\nfrom the app store.\n\n95\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.990\nThere's plenty of app store.\n\n96\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.490\nThe apps that I use the most commonly,\n\n97\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.330\nthings like Safari,\nI didn't get Safari from the app store.\n\n98\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.460\nSafari was built into MacOS.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n99\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.910\n&gt;&gt; So, well, they get sandboxed as well.\n\n100\n00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.090\nBut there's actually an extra\nlevel of protection there.\n\n101\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.790\nWhen an application comes\nfrom a third party,\n\n102\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.040\nApple didn't write that application.\n\n103\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.850\nIt's not there.\n\n104\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.920\nThey didn't make it, somebody else did.\n\n105\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.330\nSo they don't know what's supposed\nto be in it and what's not.\n\n106\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.500\nNow if the developer wants.\n\n107\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.080\nThey can submit it to Apple.\n\n108\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080\nAnd Apple can digitally\nsign that application.\n\n109\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.660\nAnd now in that form.\n\n110\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.320\nIt's approved.\n\n111\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.110\nIt gets modified.\n\n112\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.240\nThe signature fails.\n\n113\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.440\nAnd it breaks.\n\n114\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.580\nBut when it comes to the software\nthat comes with MacOS.\n\n115\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.020\nThat's included with your default install.\n\n116\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.170\nApple knows all of that, knows it by heart\nright because they created that software.\n\n117\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.260\nSo, Safari, Apple knows exactly\nwhat Safari is supposed to have and\n\n118\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.140\nso there is another service that runs\nin the background that's called system\n\n119\n00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.296\nintegrity protection.\n\n120\n00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:34.315\nAnd what s-i-p does is it watches those\nfiles the things that are included with\n\n121\n00:05:34.315 --> 00:05:39.530\nMacOS and if anything changes,\nit becomes very, very aware.\n\n122\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.110\nIt knows that it changed.\n\n123\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.190\nIt knows that that shouldn't have\nhappened or it should have happened and\n\n124\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.070\nit can fix it.\n\n125\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.810\nIt can even put it back if need be.\n\n126\n00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.200\nThat system integrity protection is\na great example of a feature that,\n\n127\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.970\nyou don't even see it.\n\n128\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.210\nThere's no icon for it.\n\n129\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.070\nThere's no running process.\n\n130\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.730\nThere is running process,\nwe just don't see it.\n\n131\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.390\nIt's completely hidden and\nautomatically running.\n\n132\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.140\nSo, those applications are getting\nprotected there's easy ways to spot this,\n\n133\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.520\nI mean, let me show you.\n\n134\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.860\nIn the GUI,\nwe don't necessarily see it, right?\n\n135\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.210\nWhen I go into my graphical user\ninterface, I go into my finder and\n\n136\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.200\nI go into Applications, right?\n\n137\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.550\nI see all the applications\nthat are installed.\n\n138\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.370\nThese might be ones that\nwere included with MacOS.\n\n139\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.890\nIt might be ones that I\ndownloaded from the App Store, or\n\n140\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.230\nthey might be ones that I installed\nfrom a third-party site without\n\n141\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.140\neven getting Apple involved at all.\n\n142\n00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.080\nAs a user, I just see icons, right?\n\n143\n00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.940\nThat's it, in fact, as I look down\nthe list here some of these, like, well,\n\n144\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.260\nlike the App Store itself, or\nSafari is in here somewhere,\n\n145\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.480\nSafari, those were included\nwith MacOS when I installed it.\n\n146\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.460\nThere's another application\nhere called Forklift.\n\n147\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.770\nThat's a little file manager that I\ninstalled via the App Store, all right?\n\n148\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.810\nSo I don't see that as a user.\n\n149\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.910\nEverything looks the same.\n\n150\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.460\nI don't recognize there's\nany protection going on.\n\n151\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.890\nI don't see that, right?\n\n152\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.547\nBut if we go to our terminal,\n\n153\n00:06:57.547 --> 00:07:01.981\ninside our terminal, you can browse\nthe application that were installed.\n\n154\n00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:07.150\nAnd in the application folders you can\nlook at the permissions that are set.\n\n155\n00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.430\nAnd you can get an idea\nof how this is working.\n\n156\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.090\nHow the sandbox thing is working.\n\n157\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.590\nSo if I go into that\napplications folder and\n\n158\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.470\nI take a look at what's in here I see\nall these different applications.\n\n159\n00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.140\nRight.\nI see Safari right here.\n\n160\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.400\nI see Forklift right here.\n\n161\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.530\nAnd if I pull up.\n\n162\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.210\nI'm going to do a long\ndirectory listing here so\n\n163\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.690\nI can see a little more information\nthan what you normally see.\n\n164\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.360\nAnd I can come in here and\nI can spot Safari, here's Safari and\n\n165\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.120\nif you look at who owns that application,\nit's owned by the user root.\n\n166\n00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.180\nYou've got to be the root user or\n\n167\n00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.630\na super user an administrator,\nin order to modify this file.\n\n168\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.670\nAnd as I look at other applications in\nhere like Forklift I see the same thing.\n\n169\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.090\nIt's installed by root right,\nso by that user.\n\n170\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.781\nThat means it is a secure\nmanaged application,\n\n171\n00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:02.236\nit's going to run in a sandbox, it's\ngoing to have limited access to my disk.\n\n172\n00:08:02.236 --> 00:08:04.786\nAnd it's protected by\nthe administrative user.\n\n173\n00:08:04.786 --> 00:08:07.640\nIf I install an application\nfrom a third party site, so\n\n174\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.693\nif I should go out on the Internet and\ndownload something.\n\n175\n00:08:10.693 --> 00:08:15.565\nThere's a little program I used\ncalled MediaInfo, and if I go on and\n\n176\n00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:18.227\ndownload MediaInfo and install it.\n\n177\n00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:22.713\nLet's see if we can find, we'll have\nto trust the first site we come across.\n\n178\n00:08:22.713 --> 00:08:25.971\nThis is the problem with downloading\nan app from the Internet, right?\n\n179\n00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:28.075\nIs that you don't necessarily\nknow is it trustworthy?\n\n180\n00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:31.870\nCan I download it,\ninstall it and it's safe?\n\n181\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.135\nI'm not sure, right?\n\n182\n00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:35.890\nBut we give it a shot, so\nI'm gonna download this real quick.\n\n183\n00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:41.094\nAnd so here's this application,\nand when I go to install it,\n\n184\n00:08:41.094 --> 00:08:43.730\nthis is not through the App Store.\n\n185\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.950\nSystem integrity protection doesn't\nknow anything about MediaInfo.\n\n186\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.608\nWell, the author who wrote it, maybe\nthey got it digitally signed by Apple,\n\n187\n00:08:50.608 --> 00:08:51.670\nI'm not sure.\n\n188\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.141\nI'm just installing it,\nbecause I'm an end user and I can, right?\n\n189\n00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:59.446\nI just installed it, it didn't even ask\nme if I was an administrator, right?\n\n190\n00:08:59.446 --> 00:09:02.502\nIt didn't make me prompt for\ncredentials or anything like that.\n\n191\n00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:06.157\nIf I go and I run that, it's gonna launch,\nand I get a little bit of a warning here\n\n192\n00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:08.901\ntelling me, hey,\nthis was downloaded from the Internet.\n\n193\n00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:12.360\nI'll just hit Open, and\nnow it's gonna come and run.\n\n194\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.649\nAnd there we go.\nAnd so now, I'm running MediaInfo,\n\n195\n00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:16.270\nall right?\n\n196\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.712\nSo I've got that program in its launch,\nbut\n\n197\n00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:21.163\nif I take a look on\nthe disc at what happened.\n\n198\n00:09:21.163 --> 00:09:26.044\nAnd I pull that up,\nI can find MediaInfo right here and\n\n199\n00:09:26.044 --> 00:09:28.878\nlook who MediaInfo's own by.\n\n200\n00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:30.900\nForm by me, right?\n\n201\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.238\nMy user account, deep as that.\n\n202\n00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.020\nSo when that application runs,\nI'm running it.\n\n203\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.708\nI'm running it as myself, as my own\ncredentials, but it's owned by me.\n\n204\n00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:41.748\nThe application won't have permissions to\naccess things beyond what I can access.\n\n205\n00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.884\nIf I've given that application\nadministrative access,\n\n206\n00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:46.805\nit can access everything, right?\n\n207\n00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:47.987\nIt can break out of its sandbox.\n\n208\n00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:51.794\nIt's not sandboxed to the same strict\nstandards that applications are if we\n\n209\n00:09:51.794 --> 00:09:53.885\ninstall them from the App Store, right?\n\n210\n00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:57.085\nThat's why Apple recommends\nthat you use the App Store,\n\n211\n00:09:57.085 --> 00:09:59.550\nthose applications are much safer.\n\n212\n00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.703\nAnd you'll see variations like the app\nI showed a moment ago, ForkLift, right?\n\n213\n00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:09.175\nIt's a file manager, and\nif I find ForkLift here in the app store,\n\n214\n00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:12.630\nif I can type in my search box that is.\n\n215\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.769\nHere's ForkLift.\n\n216\n00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:17.480\nAnd you can get ForkLift right from the\nApp Store or you can go to the website for\n\n217\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.182\nForkLift, and\nyou can download it from there, right?\n\n218\n00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:23.912\nWell, if you look at the description in\nthe App Store, it tells you about it.\n\n219\n00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:27.408\nAnd then here's this big warning,\nit says note,\n\n220\n00:10:27.408 --> 00:10:31.657\nthe App Store versions do not\ncontain the dispute feature and\n\n221\n00:10:31.657 --> 00:10:35.530\ncannot perform privileged file operations,\nright?\n\n222\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.177\nWhy are they telling me that?\n\n223\n00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.655\nWell, if I I downloaded it from\nthe App Store, it's sandboxed.\n\n224\n00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.942\nIt's restricted, restricted\napplications aren't allowed to perform\n\n225\n00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.813\nprivileged file operations,\nthey're not allowed to do that.\n\n226\n00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:48.344\nAnd the disklet feature,\nit allows you to mount cloud drives,\n\n227\n00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:50.888\nyou've gotta be an administrator\nto mount any kind of a drive.\n\n228\n00:10:50.888 --> 00:10:54.120\nSo it's stopping those from working.\n\n229\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.900\nIf I get the version from their website,\nI can do those things, right?\n\n230\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.669\nSo these are examples of how\nan application might reach outside\n\n231\n00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:02.508\nof it's sandbox, might damage things.\n\n232\n00:11:02.508 --> 00:11:06.454\nAnd when we get an application that\ncomes with macOS, or from the App Store,\n\n233\n00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:08.220\nwe know that it's safe.\n\n234\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.060\nAnd those applications are restricted\nin what they're allowed to access.\n\n235\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.510\nSo if I go back to my disk here, for\n\n236\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:18.110\nexample, most of them are going to\nbe held to a couple of folders.\n\n237\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.943\nThose are the /Applications, right?\n\n238\n00:11:19.943 --> 00:11:21.958\nAn application needs to\nbe able to write to that,\n\n239\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.230\nbecuase that's where\nthe application itself is.\n\n240\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.650\nSometiems they have settings that\nare stored inside the application, so\n\n241\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.200\nthey'll usually have\naccess to install there.\n\n242\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.542\nThen there's the /Library folder.\n\n243\n00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:36.227\nThe library folder's pretty important\nbecause that's where our application\n\n244\n00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:38.400\nsupport files are and our preferences.\n\n245\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.560\nIf you poke around inside of there,\nyou'll see two folders.\n\n246\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.037\nOne's called Applications Support and\nthe other called Preferences,\n\n247\n00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.117\nthat's where the settings for\nthose applications are stored.\n\n248\n00:11:47.117 --> 00:11:49.874\nWhen I fire up ForkLift, and\nI go into its preferences and I say,\n\n249\n00:11:49.874 --> 00:11:51.981\nI want the dark theme\ninstead of the light theme.\n\n250\n00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.170\nIt's gotta save that somewhere,\nit saves it to preferences.\n\n251\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.632\nNow these are the global preferences,\n\n252\n00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.720\nthere's the preferences in\nyour user account as well.\n\n253\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.400\nSo it could be stored there, but\nit's gonna be limited to one of those.\n\n254\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.870\nThe only other place that\nan application's allowed to install to,\n\n255\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.890\nand this is really uncommon.\n\n256\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.160\nSo I expect mine to be empty,\nis a folder called /usr/local.\n\n257\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.400\nF folder right there, right?\n\n258\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.039\nThat's a weird folder and mine is empty.\n\n259\n00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:23.067\nActually, there's a hidden application for\nthe Apple installer or\n\n260\n00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:26.047\nkeep, I'm not sure what that one is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:12:26.047 --> 00:12:28.193\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what that one is, but\n\n262\n00:12:28.193 --> 00:12:30.450\nthis is a special occasion.\n\n263\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.415\nIt's really there for\ncompatibility with Unix.\n\n264\n00:12:33.415 --> 00:12:37.619\nWhen we run macOS, we've got a nice,\npretty GUI, but under the hood,\n\n265\n00:12:37.619 --> 00:12:38.940\nit's BSD Unix.\n\n266\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.610\nAnd BSD Unix,\nwhen you install an application into it,\n\n267\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.640\nit expects it to go into /user/local,\nthat's kind of the default location.\n\n268\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.760\nSo this is one other place that\nan application might be able to install to\n\n269\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.640\nand then run from, but it also might have\napplication files that are stored there.\n\n270\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.590\nApplication files are more\nlikely cuz if it installs,\n\n271\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.980\nthere's a /user/sbin and a /user/bin,\nthat's the binary folders.\n\n272\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.353\nAnd that's usually where\nthe applications would go, but\n\n273\n00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:06.347\ntheir files would end\nup in this /user/local.\n\n274\n00:13:06.347 --> 00:13:12.470\nSo the system integrity protection and\nthe sandbox work together.\n\n275\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.842\nThe sandbox applies to pretty much\nevery application these days.\n\n276\n00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:19.591\nSystem integrity protection just\napplies to what came with macOS.\n\n277\n00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:23.118\nIf I modify Safari in any way,\nthe system knows about it,\n\n278\n00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:25.189\nand it'll stop it from running.\n\n279\n00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:27.307\nAnd it'll even replace it,\nit'll repair it and\n\n280\n00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.263\nput it back to the way it should\nhave been, happens automatically.\n\n281\n00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:34.274\nWith a third party application, if it gets\ntampered with, the signature is validated.\n\n282\n00:13:34.274 --> 00:13:36.980\nIt won't let it run, it knows to\nprotect you, but it can't fix it,\n\n283\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.180\ncuz it doesn't know what\nit's supposed to look like.\n\n284\n00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.601\nSo I would need to reinstall the\napplication or restore from Time Machine,\n\n285\n00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:44.133\nbut those features are built in.\n\n286\n00:13:44.133 --> 00:13:47.853\nI don't have to turn them on, and\nthey're just running right there in\n\n287\n00:13:47.853 --> 00:13:49.770\nthe background.\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff, but Don,\n\n288\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.890\nI have a question for you.\n\n289\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.493\nCan SIP prevent RAM-based attacks?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n290\n00:13:54.493 --> 00:13:56.265\nso I have been talking about disks, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n291\n00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:57.171\n&gt;&gt; I did this whole time,\n\n292\n00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:58.509\nI've been showing you folders,\n\n293\n00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:01.400\nlike here is where the applications\ninstall to where the data is found.\n\n294\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.063\nBut if a virus gets onto your system or\nmalware or some kind of a malicious\n\n295\n00:14:06.063 --> 00:14:11.030\nattack of some sort, it does not\nnecessarily have to write the disk.\n\n296\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.760\nAll your really juicy stuff\nis in RAM anyway, right?\n\n297\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.590\nWhen you run a program, I run Safari-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.019\n&gt;&gt; And I start opening tabs,\n\n299\n00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:22.190\nall of these tabs are in RAM-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n300\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.700\n&gt;&gt; Unlike computer, right?\n\n301\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.795\nIt's not writing this webpage to disk,\n\n302\n00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:27.639\nI mean it might be caching\nsome of the files somewhere.\n\n303\n00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:31.990\nSo really good malware can target this,\nit can target memory.\n\n304\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.238\nAnd if that happens, System Integrity\nProtection doesn't see that,\n\n305\n00:14:36.238 --> 00:14:38.159\nsandboxing doesn't see that.\n\n306\n00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:40.140\nThis is in RAM.\n\n307\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.373\nSo Apple actually has a couple of really,\nreally cool technologies in the background\n\n308\n00:14:44.373 --> 00:14:47.335\nthat are also automatic that\nhelp to prevent that, right?\n\n309\n00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:50.700\nWhen you run a program,\na progam's actually made up of many,\n\n310\n00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.525\nmany different pieces, right?\n\n311\n00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:55.368\nWhen I take a look at that\nForkLift application, right?\n\n312\n00:14:55.368 --> 00:14:59.152\nIf you two finger tap or\nright-click or whatever,\n\n313\n00:14:59.152 --> 00:15:04.344\nCtrl+click on an application,\nyou'll see Show Package Contents.\n\n314\n00:15:04.344 --> 00:15:09.197\nAnd you can browse inside, and\nkind of see what makes up that file.\n\n315\n00:15:09.197 --> 00:15:12.716\nAnd there's actually quite a bit\nthat makes up an application.\n\n316\n00:15:12.716 --> 00:15:17.487\nThe program itself is buried in there, so\nI found it inside of Contents and macOS,\n\n317\n00:15:17.487 --> 00:15:19.714\nthere's the ForkLift application.\n\n318\n00:15:19.714 --> 00:15:23.200\nBut there's more that goes along with it,\nlike frameworks.\n\n319\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.976\nHere's these frameworks that this one\nuses, some kind of neon framework,\n\n320\n00:15:26.976 --> 00:15:28.100\nfl core, xad master.\n\n321\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.484\nThese are different frameworks that have\na ton of components inside of them, and\n\n322\n00:15:32.484 --> 00:15:35.073\nthese are generally\nreferred to as libraries.\n\n323\n00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:39.569\nLibraries are basically a way of saying,\nlook, you're not the first person to come\n\n324\n00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:42.120\nup with most of the ideas that you have,\nright?\n\n325\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.456\nIt's hard to be truly innovative and\noriginal.\n\n326\n00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:49.532\nSo if you're gonna create an application,\nthe odds are somewhere you're gonna wanna\n\n327\n00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:54.840\nhave a check box or a radio button or a\nfield where somebody can type information.\n\n328\n00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.317\nYou're not the first person to think of\n\n329\n00:15:56.317 --> 00:15:56.958\nthat, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.052\n&gt;&gt; So you shouldn't have to rewrite\n\n331\n00:15:59.052 --> 00:16:00.180\nit from scratch.\n\n332\n00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.760\nInstead, you can take a library where\nsomebody's already written a function that\n\n333\n00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.600\ndisplays a button on the screen.\n\n334\n00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.478\nAnd you might be the first person to\nthink of what that button does, but\n\n335\n00:16:10.478 --> 00:16:14.840\nyou didn't invent the button, so\nwe can just reuse somebody else's button.\n\n336\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.740\nThose libraries are really handy.\n\n337\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.310\nWell, here's the problem.\n\n338\n00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.350\nMost of those libraries\nare really well known, right?\n\n339\n00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.950\nIf you go out and\n\n340\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:27.120\nGoogle search on the Neon Framework,\nyou'll find extensive documentation on it.\n\n341\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.010\nIn fact, you can probably get the SDK,\nthe software development kit, for it and\n\n342\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.130\nknow exactly how it works.\n\n343\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.320\nSo as a malware author,\nif you're a malicious person,\n\n344\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.500\nyou're writing this evil software.\n&gt;&gt; A black hat person.\n\n345\n00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.750\n&gt;&gt; There you go, a black hat hacker,\n\n346\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.260\nsomebody who's attacking systems.\n\n347\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.930\nYou could learn about this framework,\nfind a weakness in it,\n\n348\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.150\nfind a way to exploit this framework.\n\n349\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.490\nAnd then once you exploit it,\n\n350\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.550\nyou'd be able to exploit any application\non the planet that used that framework.\n\n351\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.820\nYou've written one exploit that\napplies to thousands of applications.\n\n352\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.400\nSo these libraries are targeted.\n\n353\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.180\nThat's usually what an attacker's looking\nfor because they can reuse the attack.\n\n354\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.170\nWell, if the library loads, and\nit always loads in the ram the same way,\n\n355\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.360\nthe attacker can easily find it and\nnot even know what application\n\n356\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.470\nyou're using they can find\nthe library that has loaded.\n\n357\n00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.230\nSo in MacOS, it does what is\ncalled library randomization.\n\n358\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.820\nWhen a library is loaded\nit's given an ID number and\n\n359\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.700\nthat ID number changes\nevery time it's loaded.\n\n360\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.430\nSo it's never the same ID number twice,\nand the application sees that ID\n\n361\n00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.140\nnumber when it launches, but an attacker\nwouldn't know what that ID number is.\n\n362\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.280\nSo now it's harder to identify.\n\n363\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.450\nThe other thing is they make sure\nthat it loads in a different place in\n\n364\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.820\nmemory each time.\n\n365\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.050\nThat normally if an application runs and\n\n366\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.060\nthen a library is loaded it would be right\nnext to it in memory, right in line.\n\n367\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.200\nSo an attacker can look for\n\n368\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.170\nthe application and know the library\nwas just a few blocks ahead in memory.\n\n369\n00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:54.960\nRight, but with library randomization,\nMacOS shifts that stuff around, so\n\n370\n00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.940\nyou have no idea where\nit's gonna be in memory.\n\n371\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.650\nIt moves around a lot, I say it\nmoves around, every time it loads.\n\n372\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.500\nIt's loaded to a different location.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.150\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't actively move while it's\n\n374\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.690\nsitting there.\n\n375\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:10.260\nThat would a little bit more difficult,\nbut it has a random runtime location.\n\n376\n00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.280\nAnd again, that makes it harder for\nattackers to target that.\n\n377\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.590\nSo while these libraries are really,\nreally useful, and\n\n378\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.370\nsomewhat dangerous,\nApple helps to protect that.\n\n379\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.570\nThat's all occurring in the background.\n\n380\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.460\nWe don't have to turn it on.\n\n381\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.265\nIn fact, there's not even a way for\nme to show that happening.\n\n382\n00:18:25.265 --> 00:18:29.530\nThat, when all this stuff runs, I mean,\nI could fire up the activity monitor.\n\n383\n00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.750\nAnd in the activity monitor,\n\n384\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:37.780\nif you start to look at your applications\nyou can switch into a treeview,\n\n385\n00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.330\nwhich is buried in here somewhere,\nand when you´re in the treeview you\n\n386\n00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.845\ncan see all of the different stuff that´s\nkinda buried under an application.\n\n387\n00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:54.620\nAnd I´m scanning really quick and I´m not\nseeing [LAUGH] I'm not seeing the option.\n\n388\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.860\nIt's in here somewhere,\nto go to tree view,\n\n389\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.240\nbut once you're in that tree\nview you'll be able to spot\n\n390\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.690\neach of the different things that run\ninside of a particular application.\n\n391\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.440\nAnd there's those libraries that it\ndoesn't tell you the memory address\n\n392\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.000\nwhere it's at.\n\n393\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.950\nYou can't see that ID that changes and\n\n394\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.650\nit's not even presented\nto us here as a user.\n\n395\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.300\nSo that's all stuff that's happening\nin the background, though.\n\n396\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.894\nI don't have to configure it, I don't\nhave to turn it on, it's just running,\n\n397\n00:19:15.894 --> 00:19:17.670\nit's doing it's thing.\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n398\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.020\nThat sounds great.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very neat stuff.\n\n399\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.980\nAnd that's not the only feature, right.\n\n400\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.160\nThere's another one that's a feature\nnot of the operating system, but\n\n401\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.780\na feature of the hardware.\n\n402\n00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.280\nIn macs, they use intel processor.\n\n403\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.710\nAnd intel processors have what's\ncalled the no execute bid, or\n\n404\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.270\nthe execute disable feature.\n\n405\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.890\nIt has two names for some reason.\n\n406\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.850\nBut the way no execute works is that\nif one application starts to behave\n\n407\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.390\nin a malicious pattern,\na pattern that we recognize is malicious,\n\n408\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.960\nthe processor can recognize that,\nand it can stop it.\n\n409\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.030\nAnd when I say the processor,\n\n410\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.730\nI mean the physical CPU that's\nbuilt on your motherboard.\n\n411\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.210\nThis is done in hardware,\nthis is important.\n\n412\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.960\nI don't know if you've ever had this\nhappen where an application starts going\n\n413\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.510\ncrazy, it's doing something bad, right?\n\n414\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:09.270\nAnd it It starts to maybe eat\nup all your CPU, or eat up\n\n415\n00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:14.190\ntoo much RAM and so you try and force quit\nit and you can't, it won't close right?\n\n416\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.290\nIt's stuck, it's running,\nyour system isn't responding and\n\n417\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.350\nnow you have no choice but basically\nto cut power on your system right?\n\n418\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.050\nWell you should never get that way,\nit should never be where one\n\n419\n00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.060\napplication can stop you from\nbeing able to use your system.\n\n420\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.260\nYou should always be able\nto close a program, but\n\n421\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.000\nin software, it happens, right?\n\n422\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.270\nWell what no execute does is it lets\nthe CPU recognize when an application is\n\n423\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.360\nbehaving in an incorrect way and\n\n424\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.790\nit can deny that application\naccess to the CPU, right?\n\n425\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:47.690\nSo imagine, what would happen to a human\nif you were denied access to your brain?\n\n426\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.683\nYou stop functioning, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n427\n00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:51.677\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happens here,\n\n428\n00:20:51.677 --> 00:20:53.850\nthe application stops functioning.\n\n429\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:59.300\nAnd because it's done in hardware, there\nis no way to bypass that, so malware,\n\n430\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.250\nransomeware, cryptography stuff, things\nthat will run and consume a ton of CPU and\n\n431\n00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.270\nthey start accessing files all\nacross your hard drive and\n\n432\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.290\naccessing RAM areas that\nthey shouldn't be accessing.\n\n433\n00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.170\nTrying to do buffer overflows.\n\n434\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.550\nThose things get recognized and the CPU is\nable to physically stop them regardless of\n\n435\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.360\nwhether the operating system\nis responding or not.\n\n436\n00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.360\nNow your system may still lock up.\n\n437\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.200\nYou may still have to reboot.\n\n438\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.550\nBut in a lot of cases you don't.\n\n439\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.250\nIn a lot of cases it's able to\nkill the malicious software.\n\n440\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.210\nAnd you continue about your day\nthe way that you expect to.\n\n441\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.180\nAnd that's a really cool feature.\n\n442\n00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.500\nIt's built into the CPU.\n\n443\n00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.550\nBut the operating system has\nto know about it to activate.\n\n444\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.330\nAnd well, Mac OS does.\n\n445\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.110\nSo whenever you boot up that's one\nof the first things that MacOS does,\n\n446\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.210\nis it enables all the extra features\nthat are a part of the CPU.\n\n447\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.480\nGets it all in line and\nthat's another thing that's protecting you\n\n448\n00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.840\nin the background without\nyou having to turn it on.\n\n449\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:57.280\nSo it just goes to show, security,\nit's not all gloom and doom out there.\n\n450\n00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.140\nThere's a lot of stuff that's\nactually happening for\n\n451\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.350\nus that we don't even\nhave to think about it.\n\n452\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.030\nIt's just running and doing its job.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, which is a great episode,\n\n453\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.770\nsecurity features.\n\n454\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.220\nThere's gonna be more, right Don?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so,\n\n455\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.000\nwe talked about a couple, right?\n\n456\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.800\nWe talked about sandboxing, we talked\nabout system integrity protection,\n\n457\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.190\nwe talked about library randomization and\nthe no execute bid, or\n\n458\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.390\nexecute disable, those things.\n\n459\n00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.280\nThose are all examples of system\n\n460\n00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.490\nmanaged features, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n461\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.420\n&gt;&gt; Features that are built into the OS,\n\n462\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.410\nthey're on by default,\n\n463\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.390\nwe don't need to configure them, but\nthere's a lot more that aren't like that.\n\n464\n00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.790\nAnd so I want to show several of the other\nones, but I don't have enough time here.\n\n465\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.210\nI spent too much on\nthe features we talked about.\n\n466\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.540\nSo we'll go onto a part two,\n\n467\n00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.330\nand in part two we'll take a look at\nsome of the ones we need to configure.\n\n468\n00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.640\nAnd I just wanna set the stage for\n\n469\n00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.959\nthis properly right now-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n470\n00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:48.220\n&gt;&gt; Which is just because you can turn\n\n471\n00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.500\na feature on doesn't mean\nthat you necessarily should.\n\n472\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.380\nWe need to look at each of these features\nand say, is that something that I actually\n\n473\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.340\nneed or is that just gonna make\nthings more difficult for me?\n\n474\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.720\nCuz some of them aren't necessary.\n\n475\n00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.721\nWe need to make sure we\nget a benefit out of it.\n\n476\n00:23:05.721 --> 00:23:07.012\nThese system mange ones?\nThese are ones that Apple looked at and\n\n477\n00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:07.590\nsaid everybody needs these.\n\n478\n00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.870\n100% of the people out\nthere need these features.\n\n479\n00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.620\nWe're gonna turn it on for them.\n\n480\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.910\nSo the features that we talk\nabout on the rest of this series,\n\n481\n00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.530\nthose are the ones where\nApple looked at it and\n\n482\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.750\nsaid well I could think of an example\nwhere somebody might not want this.\n\n483\n00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.380\nOr I can think of an example where\nthis wouldn't help anybody but\n\n484\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.480\nit would make their system harder to use.\n\n485\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.780\nAnd so they say, you know what,\nwe need to leave that up to the end user.\n\n486\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.240\nWe need to leave that up to them and\n\n487\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.520\ndecide, is this a feature\nthat they want to turn on.\n\n488\n00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.480\nAnd if it is, they turn it on and\nthey're more secure.\n\n489\n00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.270\nIf they don't, they leave it off, right?\n\n490\n00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.890\nBut the key secret ingredient here,\nis knowing about\n\n491\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.270\nthe feature in the first place.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n492\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Because if you don't even know about\n\n493\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.490\nit, then its going to be off and\nthere's no way it can help you,\n\n494\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.470\nso we're gonna take a look at\nthose in part two and continue on\n\n495\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.520\nthrough the rest of the security features.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n496\n00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.590\nVery well done, sir.\n\n497\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.930\nAnd security features part\ntwo is coming your way.\n\n498\n00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.730\nMake sure you see that and\npart one as well.\n\n499\n00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.950\nAnd see everything inside the Apple\ncertified associate series.\n\n500\n00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.880\nYou're gonna be very glad that you did.\n\n501\n00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.700\nAnd you'll be in the course library\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\n\n502\n00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.334\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n503\n00:24:06.334 --> 00:24:07.060\nSo check those out as well.\n\n504\n00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.690\nHey tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\n\n505\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.810\nyou know a good ITPro\nperson is always learning.\n\n506\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.060\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

00:00:04.080\n[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.163\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n5\n00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:16.400\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.750\nI'm your host, Zach Memos in this\nepisode of Apple Certified Associate.\n\n7\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.160\nSecurity features part two is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.900\nAnd we have asked Don Pezet to show us the\nway, give us the light, carry the torch\n\n9\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.460\nDon Pezet, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; I hope I can do at\n\n10\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.640\nleast one of those things.\n\n11\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.610\nThank you for having me back Zach and you\nknow in part one we had a chance to talk\n\n12\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.550\nabout some of the security\nfeatures found inside of Mac OS.\n\n13\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.910\nAnd I focused mostly on features\nthat were just turned on automatic.\n\n14\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.220\nThey were doing their thing,\nwe didn't really think about them.\n\n15\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.130\nIf you didn't know about any of\nthe features in that first episode you\n\n16\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.310\nwere still using them\nwhether you wanted to or not.\n\n17\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.990\nSo those were cool features.\n\n18\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.640\nIn this episode we're gonna\nswitch gears though and\n\n19\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.140\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout features that are not\n\n20\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.100\nenabled by default that we do have to go\nin and configure and start to implement.\n\n21\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.080\nNow, before we dig too deep\ninto some of the advanced ones\n\n22\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.120\nI wanna focus on one that's pretty basic.\n\n23\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.880\nAnd that is a password.\n\n24\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.380\nPasswords are ubiquitous.\n\n25\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.030\nPretty much everybody uses them for\nall sorts of accounts.\n\n26\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.530\nYou're probably sick and tired of\npasswords, but they serve a purpose.\n\n27\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.250\nAnd built into Mac OS there are a number\nof different ways that we can manage those\n\n28\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.060\npasswords, work with them, and support\nthem, and so that's what we're gonna be\n\n29\n00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.150\ntaking a look at right here in part two.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so, Don,\n\n30\n00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.000\nwhat password policy does Apple recommend?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n31\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.620\nApple recommends first off that\nyou do have a password, right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.720\nThey allow you to not have a password.\n\n33\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.490\nThere are ways to set up\nan account with no password,\n\n34\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.330\nbut they recommend you don't do that.\n\n35\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330\nSo they do recommend\nthat you have a password.\n\n36\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.250\nThey recommend that it be at\nleast eight characters long, so\n\n37\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.700\nit needs to have at least eight letters,\nnumbers, special characters.\n\n38\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.378\nAnd they do recommend that it's a mixture.\n\n39\n00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:51.350\nYou need to have at least one uppercase\nletter, one lowercase letter, one number,\n\n40\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.350\nand one special character like a at\nsymbol or an exclamation point or\n\n41\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.100\nsomething of that nature right,\nso that it's a complex password.\n\n42\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580\nIf I sit down at somebody's computer and\nI start to try and\n\n43\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.920\nguess what their password is gonna be,\n\n44\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.520\nI might try something like, their\nanniversary date or their birth-date.\n\n45\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.330\nWell, those are all numbers, right.\n\n46\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.900\nThat doesn't meet\nthe complexity requirements.\n\n47\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.460\nI might pick their husband's name or\ntheir wife's name or whatever.\n\n48\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.640\nAgain, not complex enough.\n\n49\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.250\nBut if you mix up your letter casing,\nif you do numbers,\n\n50\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.880\nif you use special characters,\nyou get a higher level of complexity.\n\n51\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.570\nMakes it harder for\nsomebody to guess that password.\n\n52\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.337\nThe problem is a lot of our end users,\nthey don't care.\n\n53\n00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:29.670\n[LAUGH] There's not really\na better way to put that.\n\n54\n00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.330\nThey don't care.\nThey just wanna be able to log in easy.\n\n55\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.390\nAnd so they pick easy passwords.\n\n56\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.790\nThey pick things like one, two, three,\nfour, or they leave it blank, or they\n\n57\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.440\npick a hard password and then they write\nit on a Post note and they tape it to\n\n58\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.959\nthe monitor, that kind of stuff, and that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which is great.\n\n59\n00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.766\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's one of those things that\n\n60\n00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.833\n&gt;&gt; We can educate our users and try and\n\n61\n00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.681\nteach them, and say,\nthis is why you need a stronger password,\n\n62\n00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:54.262\nand here's how you do it.\n\n63\n00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:55.662\nThat's a big part of it,\n\n64\n00:02:55.662 --> 00:03:00.004\nso Apple's recommendation though is\nthat you use a complex password and that\n\n65\n00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.290\nway people won't be able to guess that.\n&gt;&gt; So, how can we help our\n\n66\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.190\nend users choose better passwords?\n&gt;&gt; Well that's kind of a tough part.\n\n67\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.330\nEducation only goes so\n\n68\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.790\nfar but sometimes people just have\na hard time coming up with a password.\n\n69\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.510\nAnd they end up coming up with\nsomething that's predictable.\n\n70\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.850\nThey look around their office and\nthey pick items that are on their shelf.\n\n71\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.850\nOr they think about their family\nmembers and their birth dates and\n\n72\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.390\nthose are not random things.\n\n73\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.060\nThe human mind is not a random device,\nwe don't just pop in with ideas,\n\n74\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.310\nwe usually have something\nthat's seeding those ideas,\n\n75\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.540\nit gets our mind on\na certain train of thought.\n\n76\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.860\nLike when you get a song stuck in your\nhead, that didn't come out of nowhere.\n\n77\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.920\nSomething triggered the memory of that\nsong and now it's stuck in your head.\n\n78\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Brain worms.\n\n79\n00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n80\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.150\nAnd that's how the mind works.\n\n81\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.300\nSo Apple recognizes that, and\n\n82\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.480\nthey've given us what's called\nthe Password Assistant.\n\n83\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.080\nIt's a little tool that helps you\nto generate secured passwords.\n\n84\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.500\nAnd it's not a dedicated program in and\nof itself.\n\n85\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.740\nIt's actually built into the password\nfield for a lot of different areas.\n\n86\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.060\nYou see it pop up quite a bit.\n\n87\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.870\nHere, let me show you so\nyou recognize what it looks like.\n\n88\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.710\nI'm gonna go into my System Preferences.\n\n89\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.920\nAny my System Preferences I'm\ngonna go to Users and Groups.\n\n90\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.940\nAnd in my Users and Groups I can\nchange my password if I wanted or\n\n91\n00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.590\nI could, here I'll add another user and\nI'll change their password.\n\n92\n00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.150\nSo I'll create a user.\n\n93\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.460\nI'll do one for Zach.\n\n94\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.700\nSo I'm gonna give Zach an account and\nwe'll pick a password for him.\n\n95\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.370\nNow, when I go to pick a password for\n\n96\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.220\nZach, I can just type one in and if I want\nit to be lame, I can: one-two-three-four.\n\n97\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.170\nWhoops, I typed too many, so\nthere it is, I picked a wimpy password.\n\n98\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.070\nPeople can guess that,\nit's not a hard one.\n\n99\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.590\nEven if it was hard, it's only four\ncharacters, so it's easier to guess.\n\n100\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.140\nThe longer the password the more\nsecure it's going to be.\n\n101\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.250\nSo this is not going to be a good\npassword at the end of the day.\n\n102\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.480\nBut if I'm one of those people that just\nhas a hard time coming up with a password,\n\n103\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.150\nwell see this little key\n\n104\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.370\nicon here to the side?\n&gt;&gt; Right, right,\n\n105\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.790\nright.\n&gt;&gt; That is the Password Assistant.\n\n106\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.110\nAnd in most Apple applications, ones\nthat are actually written by Apple, and\n\n107\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.610\nin some third-party applications,\n\n108\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.950\nwhen you get to a password field like\nthis, you'll see that little key.\n\n109\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.680\nAnd if you click on it,\nthat'll launch the Password Assistant.\n\n110\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.300\nAnd the Password Assistant is trying\nto help you generate a secure password,\n\n111\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.260\nall right.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n112\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Now when you launch it,\n\n113\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.930\nit starts by asking you what\ntype of password you want.\n\n114\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.749\nAnd it defaults to Memorable.\n\n115\n00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.049\nif I drop that down, though,\nyou'll see that there are several options.\n\n116\n00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:29.934\nThere's manual,\nthat's where you pick the password,\n\n117\n00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:34.140\nyou don't need a password system for that,\nbut then we get memorable, Letters and\n\n118\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.528\nNumbers, Numbers Only, Random,\nand FIPS-181 compliant.\n\n119\n00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:42.575\nMemorable's the default because\nit tries to give you a balance of\n\n120\n00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:46.811\na strong password that's easy to remember.\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n121\n00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:48.350\n&gt;&gt; So, it had one one.\n\n122\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.750\nI say it's easy to remember, I've\nalready forgotten what the password was.\n\n123\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.705\nIt was up just a second ago.\n\n124\n00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:53.710\n[LAUGH] It's showing me a new one.\n\n125\n00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.890\nAnd this new one is comet.\n\n126\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.070\nAll right, comet, like a, what is that,\n\n127\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.340\nasteroid that enters the,\nI don't know, whatever.\n\n128\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.050\nAsteroid, meteor?\n&gt;&gt; Halley's\n\n129\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.040\nComet.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n130\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.690\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n131\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.155\n&gt;&gt; So we got a comet, easy to remember 29.\n\n132\n00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:10.405\nI don't know maybe I can come up with\nsome mnemonic there to remember 29.\n\n133\n00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:14.810\nThere's a open parenthesis all\nright that's a little weird, and\n\n134\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.750\nthen F-A-Q-s like\nfrequently asked questions,\n\n135\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.080\nyou see that abbreviation on\nthe internet a lot, right?\n\n136\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.300\nSo this is not something somebody's going\nto randomly guess when they try to login,\n\n137\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.640\nbut it's not so\nhard that I can't remember it.\n\n138\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.480\nIt's got uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n139\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.990\nIt's got special characters.\n\n140\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.820\nIt is 12 characters in length.\n\n141\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.310\nThat's well beyond the eight\ncharacters that Apple recommends.\n\n142\n00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.230\nAnd it's a high quality password, right.\n\n143\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.140\nAnd I didn't have to come\nup with it on my own.\n\n144\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.480\nAnd if I don't like this one,\nCuz I might not, you can hit drop-down and\n\n145\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.520\nhere it's gonna generate ten more for me.\n\n146\n00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.390\nRight, or is it nine more,\nten total, yeah.\n\n147\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.640\nAnd some of them,\nmight not wanna go with some of them,\n\n148\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.290\nright.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That one's not\n\n149\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.940\nvery good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n150\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.960\nit generated some really crazy ones here.\n\n151\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.400\nLet's try it again.\n\n152\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.910\nIf you don't like what you get,\nyou can always switch to another type and\n\n153\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.260\nswitch back to memorable and\nit'll generate an all new set of ten.\n\n154\n00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.250\nHere we go,\nthese are a little less offensive.\n\n155\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.395\nSo we've got CPAs76[stoop,\nit's not so hard to remember,\n\n156\n00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:19.590\nor ini5(rewrite.\n\n157\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.020\nThis type of password.\n\n158\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.140\nIt's a good password.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.980\n&gt;&gt; Easier to remember,\n\n160\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.970\nthat's what it's trying to help you do.\n\n161\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.677\nBut maybe it's not exactly what you want.\n\n162\n00:07:29.677 --> 00:07:30.640\nMaybe I looked at this one.\n\n163\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.986\nThis one's Elsie25{marx.\n\n164\n00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:37.400\nAnd I look at that and I say,\nman, how am I gonna remember 25?\n\n165\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.920\nWell, let's pick a number that\nI like a little better, right?\n\n166\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.060\nI like Douglas Adams.\n\n167\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.430\nYou know this Zach.\n\n168\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.540\nWhat was the answer to the question\nof life, the universe and everything?\n\n169\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.170\n&gt;&gt; 42.\n\n170\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.720\n&gt;&gt; 42, all right.\n\n171\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.550\nSo I can remember 42.\n\n172\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.760\nSo I'm gonna change that 25 to a 42.\n\n173\n00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.553\nNotice what happens as I'm changing it.\n\n174\n00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:58.157\nDid you see the green bar down here?\n\n175\n00:07:58.157 --> 00:07:59.608\nThe green bar moved.\n\n176\n00:07:59.608 --> 00:08:02.876\nIt's measuring my password\nquality while I type.\n\n177\n00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:07.242\nSo you can change this password however\nyou want to get it the way that you want.\n\n178\n00:08:07.242 --> 00:08:10.086\nAnd what it's measuring down\nhere is what's called Entropy.\n\n179\n00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:13.250\nEntropy is the randomness of the password.\n\n180\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.380\nIf you pick a dictionary word,\nit's not very random.\n\n181\n00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.140\nThe Entropy is very, very small.\n\n182\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.340\nBut if you pick some truly crazy,\nwhacked out no pattern thing,\n\n183\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.520\nthe Entropy is gonna be very high, right?\n\n184\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.060\nAnd so, we can see that, if I type 1234\nwhich I was making fun of earlier,\n\n185\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.360\nnotice that my entropy level down\nhere is really, really poor.\n\n186\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.670\nIt's telling me this password\nis not secure, it's red.\n\n187\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.638\nEntropy is only 13.3.\n\n188\n00:08:39.638 --> 00:08:42.870\nBut then if we start adding on to it,\nit does get better.\n\n189\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.928\nThe longer the password,\nthe better that it gets, right?\n\n190\n00:08:45.928 --> 00:08:48.819\nAnd as I keep typing,\nsee how it's starting to get a little\n\n191\n00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:49.570\nbit better.\n\n192\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.208\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n193\n00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:54.109\nBut it is telling me down at the bottom,\nthis is too repetitive.\n\n194\n00:08:54.109 --> 00:08:58.340\nIt knows that I'm forming a pattern,\nand so I need to mix that up.\n\n195\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.580\nIf I were to jumble around a little bit,\nnow it's not telling me it's repetitive.\n\n196\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.684\nBut it's still telling me\nthat it's a poor password,\n\n197\n00:09:05.684 --> 00:09:07.460\neven though I'm at 12 characters.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n198\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.950\n&gt;&gt; And I could start to change that by\n\n199\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.190\nthrowing in some extra characters.\n\n200\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:19.240\nAnd as I do that, my password quality is\ngetting better, and better, and better.\n\n201\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.090\nAnd if I keep going, just typing kind of\nrandom things, see how it's just getting\n\n202\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.410\nstronger, and stronger, and stronger.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n203\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.756\n&gt;&gt; Until we reach that point where\n\n204\n00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:29.834\nit decides.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n205\n00:09:29.834 --> 00:09:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's a really good password.\n\n206\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.123\nMy Entropy is now 131.4.\n&gt;&gt; And that password right there,\n\n207\n00:09:35.123 --> 00:09:37.230\nI could remember that absolutely.\n\n208\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.017\nNo, I couldn't.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:09:38.017 --> 00:09:38.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:40.057\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to be like rain man level to\n\n211\n00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.789\nremember that one.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n212\n00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:43.766\n&gt;&gt; So we're trying to find that healthy\n\n213\n00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:48.432\nbalance between security, and making your\ncomputer wicked hard to log in to, right?\n\n214\n00:09:48.432 --> 00:09:52.279\nSo we wanna make sure that people don't\nhave to write it down on a post note.\n\n215\n00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.690\nThis is not realistic, right?\n\n216\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.206\nNow, if I jump that box down,\n\n217\n00:09:55.206 --> 00:09:56.965\nI was looking at memorable.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n218\n00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:58.378\n&gt;&gt; You can do letters and numbers,\n\n219\n00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:01.280\nand now it takes out\nthe special characters, right?\n\n220\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.040\nSo that's a little bit better but\nif you take out the special characters,\n\n221\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.414\nit becomes easier for\nsomebody to guess this.\n\n222\n00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:09.184\nCuz this is only 26 letters, and\n\n223\n00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:11.199\nthere's only 10 numbers.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n224\n00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:13.030\n&gt;&gt; And I guess there's 52 letters,\n\n225\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.800\nbecome capital and lowercase, so\n\n226\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.540\nwe have a much smaller pool\nof characters to choose from.\n\n227\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.940\nThat makes brute force attacks a lot more\n\n228\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.870\npossible.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n229\n00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.250\n&gt;&gt; Special characters increase that\n\n230\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.070\npool size, and\nnow it becomes harder to guess.\n\n231\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.490\nI can go Numbers Only,\nwhich is not really the greatest.\n\n232\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.236\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n233\n00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:30.883\n&gt;&gt; And so, we end up with something\n\n234\n00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:32.046\nthat's weaker here.\n\n235\n00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:35.390\n[COUGH] And then if we jump it down,\nwe can go truly random.\n\n236\n00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.978\nTruly random will give you\nthe strongest password, but\n\n237\n00:10:37.978 --> 00:10:41.090\nalso the hardest one to remember, right?\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n238\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.680\n&gt;&gt; There's no pattern\n\n239\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.410\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n240\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.080\n&gt;&gt; How do I remember this?\n\n241\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.200\nNow, I use random passwords for\na lot of things,\n\n242\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.110\nand I typically use a password manager.\n\n243\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:53.190\nYou can use programs like LastPass, or\nKeePass, OneLogin, programs like that,\n\n244\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.340\nthat let you store all of your\npasswords in an encrypted database.\n\n245\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.858\nIn fact, Mac OS has one of those built in,\nand it has something, [COUGH]\n\n246\n00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:03.830\nThat is, basically,\n\n247\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.050\nit's called the Keychain.\n\n248\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.511\nAnd it is basically an encrypted database\nwhere your passwords can get stored as\n\n249\n00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:09.140\nyou use them.\n\n250\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.830\nSo you don't have to\nremember them every time.\n\n251\n00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.880\nThat's nice, right?\n&gt;&gt; That is\n\n252\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880\nnice.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n253\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.882\nyou do still need to remember your\npassword if you ever are not able to get\n\n254\n00:11:15.882 --> 00:11:17.130\ninto your Keychain.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.990\n&gt;&gt; Or if you are on a new computer.\n\n256\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.469\nIf I go to somebody else's computer,\nI wanna check my email,\n\n257\n00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:23.187\nit doesn't help me if it's locked\naway in a Keychain back on my other\n\n258\n00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:23.830\ncomputer.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n259\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.820\n&gt;&gt; So we do still need to remember them.\n\n260\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.622\nAnd I do have some random passwords that\nI have used so much that I remember them.\n\n261\n00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:32.543\nHopefully, we don't have to do that.\n&gt;&gt; What is the FIPS-181?\n\n262\n00:11:32.543 --> 00:11:35.130\nWhat is that?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so FIPS-181.\n\n263\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.654\nThis one is a funny one, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n264\n00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:38.562\n&gt;&gt; When I choose it,\n\n265\n00:11:38.562 --> 00:11:40.360\nit generates a password.\n\n266\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.690\nIt's all lowercase letters,\nno numbers, no special characters.\n\n267\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.040\nIt is fairly random, but at 12 characters,\n\n268\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.643\nsee how it's really low quality?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n269\n00:11:47.643 --> 00:11:48.689\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n270\n00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:56.234\n&gt;&gt; FIPS is a standard institution I guess.\n\n271\n00:11:56.234 --> 00:11:57.926\nIt's a part of the US government.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n272\n00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.862\n&gt;&gt; And the United States government sets\n\n273\n00:11:59.862 --> 00:12:00.710\nthese rules, so\n\n274\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.050\nsay like here's the certain level\nof encryption you have to use.\n\n275\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.030\nOr a certain level of data destruction you\nhave to use when data is no longer needed,\n\n276\n00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.130\nand that kind of thing.\n\n277\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:15.120\nAnd FIPS-181 is a specific policy that\nthey released that said, a password has\n\n278\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.010\nto meet this minimal level of complexity,\nand this is the minimum level.\n\n279\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.710\nAnd so, it's generating a password now.\n\n280\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.415\nBack in the 1980s and the 1990s,\nwhen FIPS-181 was created, this was good.\n\n281\n00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n282\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.070\n&gt;&gt; But it hasn't held up to the test\n\n283\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.820\nof time.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n284\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.616\n&gt;&gt; And so now,\n\n285\n00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:33.850\nFIPS-181 is really not a great\nway to generate a password.\n\n286\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.563\nIt would be hard for\na human to guess this.\n\n287\n00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:39.010\nIt'd be trivial for\na computer to guess this.\n\n288\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.820\nIt's all lowercase letters, right?\n\n289\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.820\nSo you're limited to 26 characters.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n290\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.304\n&gt;&gt; So each field here could be 26\n\n291\n00:12:45.304 --> 00:12:46.456\ncharacters.\n\n292\n00:12:46.456 --> 00:12:48.830\nThe password length is what's\ndetermining the complexity here.\n\n293\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.165\nThe longer I make the password,\nthe more complex it gets, right?\n\n294\n00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:55.024\nAnd the more difficult it would be for\nit to be guessed.\n\n295\n00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:58.940\nBut with FIBS-181, they just call for\na 12 character password,\n\n296\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.725\nwhich is not particularly strong.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.\n\n297\n00:13:01.725 --> 00:13:03.530\n&gt;&gt; So that's what that one is not many\n\n298\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.647\npeople are relying on that anymore, and\n\n299\n00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:08.583\ninstead they'll stick with things like,\nMemorable.\n\n300\n00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:11.900\nWhich generates a far more secure\npassword in the same amount of space.\n\n301\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.190\nBut it uses special characters, and\n\n302\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.920\nuppercase letters to achieve that, and\nnumbers with increasing that pool size.\n\n303\n00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.000\nNow, as I've been working with this, you\nmight have noticed in the background here.\n\n304\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.453\nIt's a little hard to see,\nbut this is that form for\n\n305\n00:13:24.453 --> 00:13:26.004\ncreating the new user, right?\n\n306\n00:13:26.004 --> 00:13:28.220\nIt's kinda hidden away in the background.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.289\n&gt;&gt; And as I have manipulated this\n\n308\n00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:33.681\npassword, you see it filling\nit in back there for\n\n309\n00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:34.500\nme?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n310\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.252\n&gt;&gt; So it's not just\n\n311\n00:13:35.252 --> 00:13:38.809\nsuggesting the password, it's actually\ntyping it into the backside there.\n\n312\n00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:42.537\nSo I've got the password, I can memorize\nit, or write it down if that's what I do,\n\n313\n00:13:42.537 --> 00:13:44.047\nor put it in my password manager.\n\n314\n00:13:44.047 --> 00:13:46.876\nAnd it's already entered in that form.\n\n315\n00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:48.418\n&gt;&gt; Form.\n&gt;&gt; You can say it's\n\n316\n00:13:48.418 --> 00:13:49.020\nalready entered into the form.\n\n317\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:55.810\nIf I choose a bad password,\nit's given me tips as to why it's bad.\n\n318\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.890\nWhat I could do to improve that password.\n\n319\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.950\nIf I take out that special character or\n\n320\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.460\nthose numbers,\nI'm gonna get a little too standard.\n\n321\n00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.710\nIt's telling me my problem.\n\n322\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.440\nHey, I need to mix characters again,\nthis isn't mixed enough.\n\n323\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.030\nAnd so now the password\nquality goes down quite a bit.\n\n324\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:15.160\nIf I just change one of those to a number,\nall of a sudden it gets much, much better.\n\n325\n00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.733\nSo those are all kind of things\nthat we need to be aware of with\n\n326\n00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:20.409\npasswords, and the password\nassistant is really designed to\n\n327\n00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:23.048\nhelp with all of that.\n&gt;&gt; Well, speaking of the password\n\n328\n00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:27.833\nassistant, is that an app we run?\n&gt;&gt; So there's not a way to directly run\n\n329\n00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:31.946\nit, what I just did right there,\nI did all through that little key icon,\n\n330\n00:14:31.946 --> 00:14:32.870\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n331\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.287\n&gt;&gt; And that's how we get at it.\n\n332\n00:14:35.287 --> 00:14:38.650\nYou'll see that appear in\na number of different places.\n\n333\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.810\nAnd I just closed that without paying\nattention what that password was.\n\n334\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.183\nSee, this is the problem with passwords,\nright?\n\n335\n00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:46.030\nWe forget, and\nnow it's on a Post-it Note on our screen.\n\n336\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.940\nSo let me put in a password\nthat I actually know, and\n\n337\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.540\nwe'll create a user account.\n\n338\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.110\nSo, [COUGH] You'll see that\npop up other places though.\n\n339\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.620\nAnd if I had gone in and tried to\nreset a password, when I reset it,\n\n340\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.890\nthere's that key again.\n\n341\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.330\nTechnically, it is\nan application that's running.\n\n342\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.250\nIt's basically spawning this window.\n\n343\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.650\nBut because it's tied into\nthe application that launches it,\n\n344\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.890\nthey don't let you launch it directly.\n\n345\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.170\nThat's how it's doing that form field.\n\n346\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.130\nFilling in the form\nfield in the background,\n\n347\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.560\nis because they're tied together.\n\n348\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.705\nSo it's stored inside of a library\nfile that applications can call.\n\n349\n00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:21.908\nWe can't run it directly.\n&gt;&gt; Does Mac OS support dual function\n\n350\n00:15:21.908 --> 00:15:23.577\nauthentication?\n&gt;&gt; It does,\n\n351\n00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:25.593\nwe're hearing more and\nmore about that, right?\n\n352\n00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:30.273\nDual factor or multi-factor authentication\nwhere right here, I've got Zach set up so\n\n353\n00:15:30.273 --> 00:15:31.157\nwhen he logs in,\n\n354\n00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:33.028\nhe logs in with a password.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n355\n00:15:33.028 --> 00:15:36.323\nI meant dual factor by the way, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew what you\n\n356\n00:15:36.323 --> 00:15:37.230\nmeant.\n&gt;&gt; Good,\n\n357\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.741\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n358\n00:15:37.741 --> 00:15:40.390\nit's basically a password.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n359\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, what if I know your password?\n\n360\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.490\nWhat if I'm walking by\nyour office one day, and\n\n361\n00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.950\nI see a Post-it Note on your desk.\n\n362\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.940\nAnd it's got a bunch of random letters and\nnumbers on it, I'm like,\n\n363\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.930\nwhoop, I bet that's his password.\n\n364\n00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.530\nAnd then later on, I try and\n\n365\n00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.960\nremote connecting to your\ncomputer on the network.\n\n366\n00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.969\nAll I need to know is your username and\nyour password.\n\n367\n00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n368\n00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.886\n&gt;&gt; Your username is not private, right?\n\n369\n00:15:56.886 --> 00:15:58.299\nYour username is always displayed.\n\n370\n00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:02.665\nIf I log out of this computer My username\nwill be displayed right on the login\n\n371\n00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:03.233\nscreen.\n\n372\n00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:05.497\nThat's how macOS works.\n\n373\n00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:08.760\nUsernames are not private,\nthey're not authentication.\n\n374\n00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.572\nYour password is, your password is\nprivate, that's authentication.\n\n375\n00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:13.211\nAnd right now that's all we have.\n\n376\n00:16:13.211 --> 00:16:16.921\nSo the multifactor movement\nsays when somebody logs in,\n\n377\n00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:20.555\nthey should have more than\njust a password, right?\n\n378\n00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:23.369\nIt should be a password,\nplus at least one other thing.\n\n379\n00:16:23.369 --> 00:16:25.331\nAnd what Zach said was\ndual-factor authentication, and\n\n380\n00:16:25.331 --> 00:16:27.049\nthat's the most common-\n&gt;&gt; That's what I meant.\n\n381\n00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:29.256\n&gt;&gt; But the official term is multi-factor,\n\n382\n00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:32.606\nbecause you might have three,\nfour, five different things.\n\n383\n00:16:32.606 --> 00:16:35.735\nNow, the more things you have,\nthe harder it gets because a password,\n\n384\n00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:37.837\nthat's just something you memorize, right?\n\n385\n00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:40.240\nSo it's called something you know.\n\n386\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.918\nThere's a PIN number,\na PIN number is also something you know.\n\n387\n00:16:43.918 --> 00:16:46.139\nSo maybe my PIN number\nis one two three four.\n\n388\n00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:49.289\nSo when I log in I've got to put\nin my password and my PIN number,\n\n389\n00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:51.256\ntwo different pieces of information.\n\n390\n00:16:51.256 --> 00:16:54.632\nI might change my password every month,\nbut my PIN number stays the same.\n\n391\n00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:56.718\nOr my password stays the same,\nI change the PIN number, but\n\n392\n00:16:56.718 --> 00:16:57.781\nit's two different pieces.\n\n393\n00:16:57.781 --> 00:17:01.224\nThey're both something I know,\nI carry with me in my head, right?\n\n394\n00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:02.922\nBut because it's just something I know,\n\n395\n00:17:02.922 --> 00:17:05.356\nit's something that I could\naccidentally share, right?\n\n396\n00:17:05.356 --> 00:17:07.285\nBecause it's not a tangible item.\n\n397\n00:17:07.285 --> 00:17:10.775\nSo that's where we started\ngetting into the other factors,\n\n398\n00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:12.770\nthings like biometrics, right?\n\n399\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.265\nBiometrics are,\nit's called something you are.\n\n400\n00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:16.599\nSomething you know is just an idea.\n\n401\n00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.743\nSomething you are is\na physical piece of you.\n\n402\n00:17:19.743 --> 00:17:21.513\nAnd that would be something,\nthat sounds gross when I say it that way.\n\n403\n00:17:21.513 --> 00:17:22.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:17:22.297 --> 00:17:23.451\n&gt;&gt; It would be something like\n\n405\n00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:24.555\na fingerprint, right?\n\n406\n00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:26.783\nSo a fingerprint,\nthat's something that I am.\n\n407\n00:17:26.783 --> 00:17:28.764\nI have this fingerprint.\n\n408\n00:17:28.764 --> 00:17:32.154\nNobody else does, odds are,\nunless they’ve severed my thumb.\n\n409\n00:17:32.154 --> 00:17:34.065\nDepending on when you watch\nthis show maybe that happened.\n\n410\n00:17:34.065 --> 00:17:34.633\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:17:34.633 --> 00:17:38.125\n&gt;&gt; So that’s the fingerprint, iris scan or\n\n412\n00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:42.132\nretinal scan, palmprint scans, DNA sample.\n\n413\n00:17:42.132 --> 00:17:44.131\nI don’t think we authentic that way yet.\n\n414\n00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:47.643\n[LAUGH] One day the computer will suck a\nlittle of your blood and then you log in.\n\n415\n00:17:47.643 --> 00:17:50.230\nSo that will be something that you are.\n\n416\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.443\nAnd then the third type is\nsomething that you have, an item,\n\n417\n00:17:53.443 --> 00:17:55.082\na physical item that you have.\n\n418\n00:17:55.082 --> 00:17:57.085\nAnd actually, I use one of these.\n\n419\n00:17:57.085 --> 00:17:58.437\nLet me dig in my pocket here.\n\n420\n00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:01.434\nI didn't plan for\nthis on the show so I'm gonna do it.\n\n421\n00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:04.553\nI've got this little,\nthis is called a Yubikey, right?\n\n422\n00:18:04.553 --> 00:18:09.430\nAnd it has a private key\ncertificate file on it.\n\n423\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.370\nAnd when I log into some of the systems\nthat I use, I have my password.\n\n424\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.570\nAnd then I plug this key into\na USB port on my computer and\n\n425\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.870\nI tap that little button and\nthat's the second piece.\n\n426\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:25.081\nSo if somebody stole my password,\nbig deal, they know my password, right?\n\n427\n00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:29.810\nBut if they don't have this key also,\nit's not gonna do them any good.\n\n428\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.211\nOr if they steal this key, it's not gonna\ndo them any good without the password.\n\n429\n00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:35.590\nThey have to have both pieces, right?\n\n430\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.458\nNow this key is something that\nI specifically bought and\n\n431\n00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:41.687\ncarry it with me on my keychain.\n\n432\n00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:45.416\nSo it's something that\nI physically got on me.\n\n433\n00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.246\nKind of like to get into the building,\nright?\n\n434\n00:18:47.246 --> 00:18:49.426\nYou've got a keycard.\n\n435\n00:18:49.426 --> 00:18:51.928\nThis is my magnet card that I touch\nthe door to let me in the building.\n\n436\n00:18:51.928 --> 00:18:55.282\nIt's something I have physically\nattached to me on this little tether.\n\n437\n00:18:55.282 --> 00:18:58.261\n[LAUGH] So\nI've got that physically on me, right?\n\n438\n00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:02.139\nBut your average Joe or\nregular person on the street doesn't have\n\n439\n00:19:02.139 --> 00:19:04.760\na keycard clipped to their belt,\nlike I do.\n\n440\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.537\nOr they don't have a little key\non their keychain like I do, but\n\n441\n00:19:08.537 --> 00:19:10.622\nthey do have a cellphone, right?\n\n442\n00:19:10.622 --> 00:19:13.660\nAnd so a lot of companies are starting\ndoing dual-factor authentication with\n\n443\n00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.218\na cellphone.\n\n444\n00:19:14.218 --> 00:19:17.579\nWhere when you log in with your\npassword it then says hey,\n\n445\n00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:20.603\nyou're a new person logging in for\nthe first time.\n\n446\n00:19:20.603 --> 00:19:25.898\nI'm gonna send you a passcode and\nyou've got to punch that passcode in here.\n\n447\n00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:29.067\nAnd it might be a text message\nthat's just sent to your phone, so\n\n448\n00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.486\nall of the sudden you get\na message in your phone.\n\n449\n00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:34.693\nAnd here's a six digit\ncode that you punch in.\n\n450\n00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:36.649\nBut with Apple,\nthey actually have another option.\n\n451\n00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:39.119\nWhich is instead of\ntexting it to your phone,\n\n452\n00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:43.023\nthey can send it to any other device\nthat's tied to your Apple account.\n\n453\n00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:45.785\nBut it does require an Apple account.\n\n454\n00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:49.818\nSo in macOS if we wanna do dual-factor\nauthentication, we can, but\n\n455\n00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:51.147\nit's tied to iCloud.\n\n456\n00:19:51.147 --> 00:19:53.548\nYou have to have an iCloud ID set up and\n\n457\n00:19:53.548 --> 00:19:57.280\nyou have to have more than one\ndevice attached to iCloud.\n\n458\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.990\nSo if you have an iPhone and\na MacBook, perfect.\n\n459\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.872\nIf you have an iPhone, an iPad, a MacBook,\nand an iMac or a Mac mini, whatever.\n\n460\n00:20:07.872 --> 00:20:12.299\nIf you have multiple Apple devices, that\ndual-factor authentication is really easy,\n\n461\n00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:13.900\nit's free, you can turn it on.\n\n462\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.223\nIt works great, and it'll eliminate the\npossibility of having someone else log in\n\n463\n00:20:18.223 --> 00:20:20.522\nto your account if they\nknow your password.\n\n464\n00:20:20.522 --> 00:20:22.950\nIt's an extra level of protection, right?\n\n465\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.917\nBut it is tied to that iCloud ID,\nand it is kinda built in there.\n\n466\n00:20:25.917 --> 00:20:30.550\nLet me just show you as an example here,\nso I've got this machine fired up.\n\n467\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.185\nAnd I can't remember if I logged in.\n\n468\n00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:33.652\nI think I did log into iCloud on it.\n\n469\n00:20:33.652 --> 00:20:34.759\nLet's find out.\n\n470\n00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:40.681\nSo if I come in here and I go into my\nsystem preferences and I go into iCloud.\n\n471\n00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:42.420\nActually I'm not signed in.\n\n472\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.513\nSo I'm not signed into\niCloud on this system.\n\n473\n00:20:44.513 --> 00:20:46.769\nSo if I want to sign in I\ncan punch in my account.\n\n474\n00:20:46.769 --> 00:20:49.325\nSo I'll punch in my company account.\n\n475\n00:20:49.325 --> 00:20:51.112\nAnd I can punch in my password.\n\n476\n00:20:51.112 --> 00:20:55.432\nAnd this is where it gets difficult\ncuz I have to remember my password and\n\n477\n00:20:55.432 --> 00:20:56.590\nI will punch it in.\n\n478\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.673\nAll right, now,\nthe password is something I know.\n\n479\n00:20:59.673 --> 00:21:01.221\nIt's something in my head.\n\n480\n00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:02.225\nI know my password or\n\n481\n00:21:02.225 --> 00:21:03.961\nI hope I know my password.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n482\n00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:04.996\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna click Sign In and\n\n483\n00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:06.308\nwe'll find out if I know it or not.\n\n484\n00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.726\nNow, that's factor one.\n\n485\n00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.010\nBut I have dual-factor\nauthentication turned on for\n\n486\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.420\nmy iCloud account because I do things like\nthis and I show my account on the show.\n\n487\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.410\nAnd I don't want people to log into it so\nI have dual-factor authentication.\n\n488\n00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.266\nSo it phones home to Apple and then it\nsees that dual-factor authentication and\n\n489\n00:21:22.266 --> 00:21:24.521\nit says all right, I need to verify.\n\n490\n00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:27.207\nNow, this is actually not\ndual-factor right here.\n\n491\n00:21:27.207 --> 00:21:29.861\nIt's trying to connect my iCloud account.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n492\n00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:32.005\n&gt;&gt; And when it goes to connect it,\n\n493\n00:21:32.005 --> 00:21:35.473\nit needs to know my,\nlet me get that out of the way.\n\n494\n00:21:35.473 --> 00:21:40.113\nIt needs to know my computer's password.\n\n495\n00:21:40.113 --> 00:21:42.859\nMy computer password is not\nthe same as my iCloud password.\n\n496\n00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:43.359\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n497\n00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.863\n&gt;&gt; So in order for iCloud my computer,\n\n498\n00:21:44.863 --> 00:21:46.579\nit's gotta know my computer password.\n\n499\n00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:48.713\nSo I'm gonna punch that in real quick,\nall right?\n\n500\n00:21:48.713 --> 00:21:51.364\nBut the actual dual-factor message is this\n\n501\n00:21:51.364 --> 00:21:54.214\nlittle tiny box that appeared, okay?\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n502\n00:21:54.214 --> 00:21:57.155\ntiny.\n&gt;&gt; What's going on here is that I'm on\n\n503\n00:21:57.155 --> 00:21:58.504\na virtual machine.\n\n504\n00:21:58.504 --> 00:22:02.251\nThis client is a virtual machine and\nthis little tiny box\n\n505\n00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:06.569\nis appearing on my actual laptop,\nmy actual MacBook over here.\n\n506\n00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:10.474\nSo see how when I switch over out of my\nvirtual machine, here's my actual desktop.\n\n507\n00:22:10.474 --> 00:22:13.934\nAnd it's telling me my Apple ID is\nnow being used on a new machine.\n\n508\n00:22:13.934 --> 00:22:18.157\nIt phoned home to my other machine\nto verify that this was okay.\n\n509\n00:22:18.157 --> 00:22:20.158\nThat was that dual-factor, right?\n\n510\n00:22:20.158 --> 00:22:22.126\nAnd if this was the first\ntime I had done it,\n\n511\n00:22:22.126 --> 00:22:24.875\nit would have actually given me\na six digit code to punch in.\n\n512\n00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:26.858\nBut I had already done it on that machine.\n\n513\n00:22:26.858 --> 00:22:31.125\nI could, actually here we could\nfire up an extra machine.\n\n514\n00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:34.398\nAnd I'll show you what it looks\nlike the very first time you do it.\n\n515\n00:22:34.398 --> 00:22:38.450\nSo the very first time you link, this\none will fire up here in just a moment.\n\n516\n00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.726\nThe very first time you link,\nit has to do a full verification and\n\n517\n00:22:41.726 --> 00:22:43.191\nsay is this absolutely you?\n\n518\n00:22:43.191 --> 00:22:46.055\nBut if you've done it before,\nit logs in like this one did, and\n\n519\n00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:48.019\nit's now connected to my iCloud account.\n\n520\n00:22:48.019 --> 00:22:52.074\nSo I have that dual-factor\nwhich really does protect me.\n\n521\n00:22:52.074 --> 00:22:55.888\nSo that if somebody does get my\npassword or guesses my password, that\n\n522\n00:22:55.888 --> 00:23:00.031\nthey're not going to be able to actually\nget in and access my information or\n\n523\n00:23:00.031 --> 00:23:01.825\nresources or whatever.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n524\n00:23:01.825 --> 00:23:04.544\n&gt;&gt; Your iCloud account is important to\n\n525\n00:23:04.544 --> 00:23:07.269\nprotect because, and I closed it.\n\n526\n00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:09.025\nLet me open that back up again.\n\n527\n00:23:09.025 --> 00:23:11.546\nBecause look at all the stuff\nthat's inside of it.\n\n528\n00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:15.428\nYour iCloud drive, your contacts,\nyour mail, your calendars.\n\n529\n00:23:15.428 --> 00:23:18.840\nIf somebody was able to get into this,\nthat's all of your information.\n\n530\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n531\n00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:20.164\n&gt;&gt; On top of that,\n\n532\n00:23:20.164 --> 00:23:22.028\nyou probably have credit\ncard data attached so\n\n533\n00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:24.002\nthat you can go into the App Store and\nbuy things.\n\n534\n00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:25.643\nAnd so if someone gets in,\nnow they can gonna buy stuff.\n\n535\n00:23:25.643 --> 00:23:27.932\nThey've got your credit card,\nor access to your credit card.\n\n536\n00:23:27.932 --> 00:23:32.603\nSo that's all a challenge that we have\nwhen we need to protect this information.\n\n537\n00:23:32.603 --> 00:23:35.054\nSo that's why we have this\nextra level of security.\n\n538\n00:23:35.054 --> 00:23:36.950\nSo when I log in on this other machine,\n\n539\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.393\nI'm just logging in as\na fake user account here.\n\n540\n00:23:39.393 --> 00:23:41.722\nI've got an account for\nChristopher Walken, cuz-\n\n541\n00:23:41.722 --> 00:23:43.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Christopher Walken.\n\n542\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.945\n&gt;&gt; He's on the show all the time.\n\n543\n00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.295\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't like gerbils cuz\n\n544\n00:23:46.295 --> 00:23:47.087\nthey're fast.\n\n545\n00:23:47.087 --> 00:23:47.856\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here we go.\n\n546\n00:23:47.856 --> 00:23:48.818\nSo I've logged in.\n\n547\n00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:52.740\nI've not connected this one to iCloud,\nso when I go into my System Preferences.\n\n548\n00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.040\nAnd I go into iCloud and\nI go to connect this one to my account.\n\n549\n00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.781\nThis would be the first time\nthis one has connected.\n\n550\n00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:06.416\nAnd so when I punch in my data,\nRight here, it's\n\n551\n00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:11.229\ngonna phone home to Apple, and it's gonna\nask me for the six digit code, right?\n\n552\n00:24:11.229 --> 00:24:17.835\nAnd back on my actual laptop, oops,\nit actually appeared right here.\n\n553\n00:24:17.835 --> 00:24:18.348\nIt's not gonna let me move that.\n\n554\n00:24:18.348 --> 00:24:19.858\nAll right, well we'll just look here.\n\n555\n00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.903\nFirst thing it's doing is saying, hey,\n\n556\n00:24:21.903 --> 00:24:25.353\nwe just detected your Apple ID is\nbeing used on a new machine and here's\n\n557\n00:24:25.353 --> 00:24:27.891\nwhere it is, it used location services.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness\n\n558\n00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:28.772\ngracious.\n&gt;&gt; And it says,\n\n559\n00:24:28.772 --> 00:24:30.011\nwe've detected a computer\nright here in Gainesville.\n\n560\n00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:32.971\nI've gotten this message in\nthe middle of the day and\n\n561\n00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:35.200\nit showed a computer in Korea, right?\n\n562\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.070\nIn South Korea, not North Korea.\n\n563\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.342\nAnd that wasn't me, I haven't been\nto South Korea ever to my knowledge.\n\n564\n00:24:41.342 --> 00:24:44.863\n[LAUGH] So that was a big warning,\nand like I said, don't allow them,\n\n565\n00:24:44.863 --> 00:24:46.644\nthat's that, stopped, right?\n\n566\n00:24:46.644 --> 00:24:49.305\nBut that means somebody found my password.\n\n567\n00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:52.677\nSomebody was able to guess my\npassword to at least get to this far.\n\n568\n00:24:52.677 --> 00:24:53.249\n&gt;&gt; In North\n\n569\n00:24:53.249 --> 00:24:53.916\nKorea.\n&gt;&gt; In\n\n570\n00:24:53.916 --> 00:24:54.631\nSouth Korea.\n&gt;&gt; South\n\n571\n00:24:54.631 --> 00:24:55.257\nKorea.\n&gt;&gt; So I don't-\n\n572\n00:24:55.257 --> 00:24:55.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n573\n00:24:55.757 --> 00:24:57.344\n&gt;&gt; Wanna start an international incident\n\n574\n00:24:57.344 --> 00:24:58.406\nhere.\nSo anyhow and\n\n575\n00:24:58.406 --> 00:25:03.311\nmaybe they weren't even in South Korea cuz\nyou can use VPNs to mask your location and\n\n576\n00:25:03.311 --> 00:25:04.296\nall that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n577\n00:25:04.296 --> 00:25:06.017\n&gt;&gt; But the point is it wasn't Gainesville,\n\n578\n00:25:06.017 --> 00:25:08.735\nFlorida, right?\nAnd even if I do see Gainesville, it could\n\n579\n00:25:08.735 --> 00:25:12.770\nstill be an attacker here in Gainesville.\nSo when I hit Allow, I'm gonna allow the\n\n580\n00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.486\nconnection and then it gives me a code.\nHere's a six digit code, and so\n\n581\n00:25:17.486 --> 00:25:22.716\nif I'm legit, if this is me on\nthe machine that I'm testing,\n\n582\n00:25:22.716 --> 00:25:28.626\nI can punch in that code, 019059.\nI had to know the password to get in and\n\n583\n00:25:28.626 --> 00:25:32.467\nthen I had to know this code to\nallow the account to connect.\n\n584\n00:25:32.467 --> 00:25:34.125\nAnd I know it looks like that code was\n\n585\n00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:38.237\nright here on the machine, but it wasn't.\nRemember, that code was actually on my\n\n586\n00:25:38.237 --> 00:25:41.107\nlaptop, my other Apple device\nthat I was logged in as.\n\n587\n00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:42.820\nIn my office, I have a Mac mini,\n\n588\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.288\nthe code was in there too.\nIf we grab the camera and\n\n589\n00:25:45.288 --> 00:25:48.100\nran all the way to my office,\nit would be over there too.\n\n590\n00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.951\nAnd so you'd see that same kinda thing.\n\n591\n00:25:49.951 --> 00:25:53.111\nBut once we're here,\nwe can get in, and boy,\n\n592\n00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:55.905\nit really wants to install those updates.\n\n593\n00:25:55.905 --> 00:26:01.311\nWe can get in, add the account,\nand that's gonna connect up.\n\n594\n00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:03.523\nAnd now we're in,\nit says dual factor authentication.\n\n595\n00:26:03.523 --> 00:26:07.990\nIt is supported by macOS, but it does\nrequire the use of an iCloud account.\n\n596\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.650\nOnce this is done, I still log into\nthe computer with my regular username and\n\n597\n00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.660\npassword, not the iCloud account.\n\n598\n00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.255\nBut if I ever forget my password or\nI forget,\n\n599\n00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:20.267\nsome reason I have filed to encrypting\nmy disk and I can't get at it.\n\n600\n00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:23.055\nI can use iCloud to reset my password and\nget in.\n\n601\n00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:27.052\nSo now I've got iCloud\nacting as a backup for me.\n\n602\n00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:31.968\nAnd I'm able to access my information and\nuse that as that backup process.\n\n603\n00:26:31.968 --> 00:26:33.746\nSo there we go, it is connected.\n\n604\n00:26:33.746 --> 00:26:37.232\nI told them not to sync anything,\ncuz I am syncing to too many machines now.\n\n605\n00:26:37.232 --> 00:26:43.377\nBut once I'm in, now I'm protected and\nI know that I've got a nice secure system.\n\n606\n00:26:43.377 --> 00:26:45.167\nAnd I don't have to worry about\npeople guessing my password.\n\n607\n00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:48.257\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, are there any other\n\n608\n00:26:48.257 --> 00:26:53.130\ntypes of password security in macOS?\n&gt;&gt; There's a handful of other types\n\n609\n00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.290\nof passwords, most of which regular\nusers don't ever deal with.\n\n610\n00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.420\nThere is one though,\nthat I think is kind of important.\n\n611\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.055\nAnd I know I don't have time for\nit here in this episode, but\n\n612\n00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:03.188\nthere's what's called a firmware password.\n\n613\n00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:07.183\nThe passwords that I've been showing\nyou have all been inside of macOS.\n\n614\n00:27:07.183 --> 00:27:09.756\nWell, the problem here is I\ncould boot to recovery and\n\n615\n00:27:09.756 --> 00:27:11.883\nin recovery you can reset these passwords.\n\n616\n00:27:11.883 --> 00:27:14.539\nIf you forget your password,\nyou can reset them, right?\n\n617\n00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:16.396\nWell that means an attacker\ncan reset them.\n\n618\n00:27:16.396 --> 00:27:20.148\nIf I steal Zach's laptop and\nI run to my office and he doesn't notice,\n\n619\n00:27:20.148 --> 00:27:23.782\nI could boot into recovery,\nreset his password, logged in as him.\n\n620\n00:27:23.782 --> 00:27:25.876\nAnd now I'd have access to\nhis information, right?\n\n621\n00:27:25.876 --> 00:27:26.531\n&gt;&gt; Dad burn it.\n\n622\n00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:27.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that woud be bad.\n\n623\n00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:28.756\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad.\n\n624\n00:27:28.756 --> 00:27:30.574\n&gt;&gt; FileVault can help protect from that,\n\n625\n00:27:30.574 --> 00:27:33.673\ncuz it can encrypt the disk, but\nit still has certain weaknesses.\n\n626\n00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:37.783\nA firmware password though, that says\nwhen you push power on your Mac, and\n\n627\n00:27:37.783 --> 00:27:41.384\nthe hardware is turning on,\nit immediately asks for a password.\n\n628\n00:27:41.384 --> 00:27:45.572\nAnd if you don't provide a password, it\nwon't even allow you to boot off a disk.\n\n629\n00:27:45.572 --> 00:27:47.577\nYou can't boot off of a USB,\nyou can't boot off of a network.\n\n630\n00:27:47.577 --> 00:27:49.558\nYou can't boot to recovery,\n\n631\n00:27:49.558 --> 00:27:52.678\nyou can't even get past the power button-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n632\n00:27:52.678 --> 00:27:53.600\n&gt;&gt; That's where you stop.\n\n633\n00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.912\nThat's a great way to secure your hardware\nif it's being stored somewhere that you\n\n634\n00:27:56.912 --> 00:27:57.535\ndon't trust.\n\n635\n00:27:57.535 --> 00:28:01.948\nIf you have a Mac mini that's powering\na display and it's stuck at a school.\n\n636\n00:28:01.948 --> 00:28:04.398\nAnd you don't have visibility\non it 24 hours a day,\n\n637\n00:28:04.398 --> 00:28:06.036\nwell put a firmware password on it.\n\n638\n00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:09.126\nIf somebody steals it,\nthey won't be able to unlock it.\n\n639\n00:28:09.126 --> 00:28:11.259\nSo I wanna show you all that,\nbut I'm out of time.\n\n640\n00:28:11.259 --> 00:28:13.940\nSo we'll do a part three, Zach.\n\n641\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.154\nAnd we'll kick off with the firmware\npassword in that episode.\n\n642\n00:28:16.154 --> 00:28:18.575\nShow you guys how to get it configured and\nhow that works, and\n\n643\n00:28:18.575 --> 00:28:20.780\ntalk a little bit more\nabout the details on it.\n\n644\n00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.800\nBut all the other passwords that we saw,\n\n645\n00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.187\nthose are the regular ones that\nevery user's gonna make use of, and\n\n646\n00:28:26.187 --> 00:28:29.470\nis an important part of using a Mac.\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Don, and if that doesn't\n\n647\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.690\nmake you wanna see part three of\nSecurity Features, I don't know what will.\n\n648\n00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.853\nBut before we move on,\n\n649\n00:28:33.853 --> 00:28:37.172\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; I talked about setting a strong\n\n650\n00:28:37.172 --> 00:28:40.613\npssword, I didn't really talk about\nhow long you should use it for.\n\n651\n00:28:40.613 --> 00:28:43.047\nRemember that the longer\nyou use the same password,\n\n652\n00:28:43.047 --> 00:28:46.209\nthe more time an attacker has to try and\nguess what that password is.\n\n653\n00:28:46.209 --> 00:28:48.789\nSo the recommendation is that\nyou shouldn't use a password for\n\n654\n00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:50.304\nmore than three months, 90 days.\n\n655\n00:28:50.304 --> 00:28:52.259\nIdeally, it should be even shorter, right?\n\n656\n00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:55.952\nAnd that's a difficult thing to do,\nchanging your password that frequently.\n\n657\n00:28:55.952 --> 00:28:57.808\nSo don't hesitate to\nuse a password manager,\n\n658\n00:28:57.808 --> 00:29:00.900\nsome kind of utility that helps you\nto keep track of those passwords.\n\n659\n00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.076\nBut if you do, make sure it's\nfrom a company that you trust.\n\n660\n00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:04.696\nAnd that, that is stored securely,\n\n661\n00:29:04.696 --> 00:29:07.063\ncuz if somebody compromises\nyour password manager.\n\n662\n00:29:07.063 --> 00:29:09.428\nNow your passwords are lost,\n\n663\n00:29:09.428 --> 00:29:11.316\nwhich is not good.\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n\n664\n00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:12.412\n&gt;&gt; So we wanna make sure we\n\n665\n00:29:12.412 --> 00:29:13.229\nkeep that safe.\n\n666\n00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:15.858\nBut true strong passwords and\nchange them often.\n\n667\n00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:16.954\n&gt;&gt; Well said, sir.\n\n668\n00:29:16.954 --> 00:29:18.354\nSecurity features part three.\n\n669\n00:29:18.354 --> 00:29:20.249\nAnd make sure you see all the parts, and\n\n670\n00:29:20.249 --> 00:29:23.715\nmake sure you see everything in\nthe Apple Certified Associate series.\n\n671\n00:29:23.715 --> 00:29:26.941\nYou're gonna be very glad that you did,\nand you're gonna be in the course library\n\n672\n00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:28.931\nwhere there's thousands\nof other videos there.\n\n673\n00:29:28.931 --> 00:29:32.226\nDesigned to do one thing, to help you\ngo further, so check those out too.\n\n674\n00:29:32.226 --> 00:29:34.652\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n675\n00:29:34.652 --> 00:29:36.412\nITPro.TV is bingeworthy.\n\n676\n00:29:36.412 --> 00:29:38.532\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:05.141\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:10.559\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.588\nempowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:21.073\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\nwith Apple certified associate, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:23.470\nthis is security features part three.\n\n8\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.645\nYou demanded it and\nwe're bringing it too you.\n\n9\n00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.394\nAnd the person who's got all\nthe information we need is Don Pozet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.570\nDon, great to see you again.\n\n11\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.485\n&gt;&gt; Hey, great to be back Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:34.583\nAnd I felt a little bit bad at the end of\nthe last episode, because we got to this\n\n13\n00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.758\none type of password that we\njust didn't have time to show.\n\n14\n00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:41.593\nSo we're gonna come right back here, we\nleft everybody dangling with this threat,\n\n15\n00:00:41.593 --> 00:00:43.440\nwhat if somebody steals your computer?\n\n16\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.171\nThey could reset your password, and\naccess everything, and it's a nightmare.\n\n17\n00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:49.517\nIt's actually not a nightmare,\nit's not a big deal,\n\n18\n00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:51.350\nfirmware passwords can protect us.\n\n19\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.348\nAnd so in this episode we're\ngonna start off with that,\n\n20\n00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:56.153\nwe're gonna give you a chance to see\nfirmware passwords, how to turn them on,\n\n21\n00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:57.916\nhow they work,\ngetting an idea of what they are.\n\n22\n00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:01.276\nAnd then we're gonna continue on with\nour security feature journey and\n\n23\n00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:02.848\ntake a look at a few other things.\n\n24\n00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:05.901\nAnd it has to do with passwords and screen\nlock and all the other mess that we need\n\n25\n00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.490\nto make sure that our end users\nare doing to keep their data safe.\n\n26\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.449\nAll that is coming up right\nhere in this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.400\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nhow can we enable a firmware password?\n\n28\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, well like the name implies,\n\n29\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.750\na firmware password is\npart of the firmware.\n\n30\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.380\nIn other words, the software that powers\nthe main motherboard of your Mac.\n\n31\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170\nSo it's not part of MacOS,\n\n32\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.670\nit's a part of the motherboard,\nit's a part of the hardware.\n\n33\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.670\nAnd that's why if somebody steals\nyour computer, even if they,\n\n34\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.610\nwell let me give you a scenario.\n\n35\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.270\nA lot of time if somebody\nsteals a computer,\n\n36\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.350\nthey don't care about\nthe data that's on it.\n\n37\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990\nIf somebody steals my laptop,\n\n38\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.620\nthey don't want my information,\nthey want the laptop, right?\n\n39\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.848\nThey could take the laptop, and\nsell it on eBay and get some money, or\n\n40\n00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:47.305\ntake it to a pawn shop, right?\n\n41\n00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:49.900\nThey can turn it into\ncash is the whole point.\n\n42\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.500\nWell, if the computer doesn't work,\nthey can't do that, it's gotta work.\n\n43\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.670\nSo if I have an encrypted hard drive,\nlet's say, I've got FileVault on there,\n\n44\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.600\nand so the hard drive is encrypted,\nthey can't get at my data.\n\n45\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.850\nAll right,\nwe'll just format the hard drive.\n\n46\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.780\nApple makes it easy to reinstall\nthe operating system on there.\n\n47\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.710\nDoesn't cost you any money.\n\n48\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.960\nYou reinstall the OS.\n\n49\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.642\nNow, it's a functioning laptop.\n\n50\n00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:11.360\nAnd they can sell it on eBay and\nmake some money, right?\n\n51\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.720\nSo the firmware password,\nit's part of the motherboard.\n\n52\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.791\nWhen you press that power button,\nit won't let the computer turn on.\n\n53\n00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:23.419\nIt won't let it boot an operating\nsystem from anything, from a USB key,\n\n54\n00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.280\nfrom the hard drive, nothing,\nunless you punch in the password.\n\n55\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.100\nSo now, even if they put a brand new\nhard drive in there, it won't work.\n\n56\n00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.970\nAnd how do you reset the password,\nif they want to turn it off?\n\n57\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.900\nYou can't.\n\n58\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.960\nThe only way to reset the password on Macs\nthat have been sold in the last seven\n\n59\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.990\nyears is to take the Mac\ndown to an Apple store\n\n60\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.120\nwith your receipt that shows\nyou're the one who bought it.\n\n61\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.280\nAnd if you have that\nmachine registered to you,\n\n62\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.720\nthey can reset the password\nat the Apple store.\n\n63\n00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.780\nBut if you don't have the receipt,\nthey're not gonna do it.\n\n64\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.360\nThey will not reset it.\n\n65\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.480\nAnd it really deters theft.\n\n66\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.190\nThat if somebody steals that laptop,\nit's useless.\n\n67\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.169\nThey might be able to take the display and\nsell the display for parts.\n\n68\n00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.555\nThey might be able to take the hard\ndrive out, format that, but\n\n69\n00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:09.740\nmost of them have hard drives that\nare soldered on to the motherboards now.\n\n70\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.681\nSo you can't even do that.\n\n71\n00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:14.720\nThe motherboard is locked,\nunit is effectively worthless, right?\n\n72\n00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.950\nAnd that's a key feature here.\n\n73\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.220\nYour data stay safe and\nthe hardware is worthless to anybody but\n\n74\n00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.290\nyou, which helps to prevent theft.\n\n75\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.790\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n76\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.940\n&gt;&gt; But it also means it's hard to turn on\nthe password because if we boot into our\n\n77\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.350\nregular operating system,\n\n78\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.930\nwe're already well past the hardware\nstage at that point and\n\n79\n00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.320\nit doesn't have a way to communicate with\nthat hardware to be able to turn it on.\n\n80\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.630\nIf there was a way to do\nthat in theory malware or\n\n81\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.780\na virus could potentially\nturn off that password and\n\n82\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.560\nturn on that password and\nset it to something you don't even know.\n\n83\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.750\nThat would be a mean trick to play.\n\n84\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'd be terrible.\n\n85\n00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.930\n&gt;&gt; So if we want to set the firmware\npassword we've got to boot\n\n86\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.780\ninto recovery mode.\n\n87\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.610\nAnd normally when you press the power\nbutton on a Mac what does it do right?\n\n88\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.290\nThe firmware kicks on.\n\n89\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.640\nIt locates the hard drive.\n\n90\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.390\nMight be an SSD, might be a spinning disk.\n\n91\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.340\nWhatever it is it finds that disk.\n\n92\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.870\nIt finds the operating system and\nit boots it up.\n\n93\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.330\nWe need to bypass that.\n\n94\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.770\nWe need to press the power button,\nget it to boot, and boot to recovery.\n\n95\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.180\nBecause in recovery mode we have a few\nextra utilities that we don't get.\n\n96\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.840\nIn the regular Mac OS operating system,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.310\nThat firmware password is the big one.\n\n98\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.360\nSo let me show you what that's like.\n\n99\n00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.395\nI'm gonna take my trusty Mac\nmini here that's on my desktop.\n\n100\n00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.950\nAnd I'm already just at the login screen,\nbut I'm not gonna log in.\n\n101\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.090\nI'm gonna shut it down because in order\nto get to recovery we need to power off,\n\n102\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.280\nand when I boot the Mac, I normally\njust push the power button, right.\n\n103\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.720\nBut I'm not gonna do that this time.\n\n104\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.870\nThis time I'm gonna hold\nCmd+R on my keyboard.\n\n105\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.749\nSo I've got a nice black screen right now,\nthe is off.\n\n106\n00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.976\nI'm gonna hold Cmd+R on my keyboard.\n\n107\n00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:49.770\nAnd while I'm holding Cmd+R I'm\nwanna push the power button, okay?\n\n108\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.370\nSo it's gonna turn on and\nI'm wanna just keep holding Cmd+R In I\n\n109\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.620\nsay that when we look over here and\nmake sure it actually turned off.\n\n110\n00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.400\nIf you have found vault turned on,\nsometimes it takes a little bit longer for\n\n111\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.330\nMAC to power off and so you might have to\nwait a bit for it to actually power off.\n\n112\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.430\nSo I have to wait for\nthat light to go out.\n\n113\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.380\nSo I'm cheating here.\n\n114\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.520\nI'm looking at the front of the MAC.\n\n115\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.950\nMake sure light is out, it is.\n\n116\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.620\nNow I'm gonna hold Cmd+R.\n\n117\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.750\nI'm gonna hit that power button okay?\n\n118\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.550\nNow, the unit's gonna turn on.\n\n119\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.654\nAnd normally what will happen\nis you'll hear the Apple tone,\n\n120\n00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:21.153\nthe little dong that occurs.\n\n121\n00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:24.290\nWe're not gonna hear it here because the\nMac is too far away from my microphone.\n\n122\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.441\nBut it's gonna go to turn on, we'll see\nthe little Apple icon appear that normally\n\n123\n00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:30.530\nhas a little status bar that goes across.\n\n124\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.781\nBut instead of loading the operating\nsystem, what's going to happen is,\n\n125\n00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:35.540\nit's gonna boot to recovery.\n\n126\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.560\nNow, it will look like it's\nbooting the normal OS, but\n\n127\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.740\ninstead it's actually gonna boot into\nrecovery which is booting a lot slower.\n\n128\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.980\nSo I've got a nice black screen here.\n\n129\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.690\nMy computer is off.\n\n130\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.175\nI'm gonna hold Cmd+R on my keyboard,\nand I'm gonna hit the power button.\n\n131\n00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.924\nAnd on yours,\nyou might actually hear the Mac tone.\n\n132\n00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.071\nYou know the little dong that happens.\n\n133\n00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:55.587\nOn mine,\n\n134\n00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:59.915\nI'm not gonna hear that because I have\nan HDMI cable hooked up with no speakers.\n\n135\n00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:01.638\nIt's running through our\nvideo-capture device.\n\n136\n00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:03.822\nBasically it's gonna start powering on,\nand\n\n137\n00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.455\nyou're gonna see some things\nsimilar to a normal buoy.\n\n138\n00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:10.035\nYou'll see the Apple logo appears and\nthe little bar starts crawling across.\n\n139\n00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:12.128\nAs soon as you see that\nyou can let go of Cmd+R.\n\n140\n00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:15.214\nI just let it go I was holding\nit down the whole time But\n\n141\n00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:17.930\nI let go now it's booting to recovery.\n\n142\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.020\nI don't necessarily see that,\nI don't know it,\n\n143\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.110\nit might look like\na normal boot to me right?\n\n144\n00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.660\nBut instead of booting my normal OS\n\n145\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.680\nit's booting to the recovery operating\nsystem which is stored separately.\n\n146\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.771\nAnd as it boots that it's gonna\nload up to a different screen,\n\n147\n00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.586\na screen that has a number of utilities\navailable for us to work with our Mac.\n\n148\n00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:38.408\nMost of those utilities center around\nstoring a time machine back up or\n\n149\n00:06:38.408 --> 00:06:39.654\nreinstalling MacOS.\n\n150\n00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:41.411\nThat's not what I wanna do.\n\n151\n00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:45.548\nBut hidden away in one of the menus when\nwe get into recovery is the option to\n\n152\n00:06:45.548 --> 00:06:47.255\nenable a firmware password.\n\n153\n00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:50.046\nAnd so that's where we have\nto go to get this turned on.\n\n154\n00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:54.100\nNow, booting to recovery takes longer\nthan booting to the normal OS.\n\n155\n00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say.\n\n156\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.317\n&gt;&gt; It takes a while.\n\n157\n00:06:56.317 --> 00:07:01.841\nAnd I've got an SSD in this, which is\nthe solid date disk, very very fast.\n\n158\n00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:05.314\nBut because its loading\na non-optimized operating system,\n\n159\n00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:07.056\nit’s got to copy it on the RAM.\n\n160\n00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:11.165\nAnd once it’s in RAM, it’s got to detect\nyour hardware and go through that process.\n\n161\n00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:14.840\n&gt;&gt; Not all the hardware get detected,\nwhich is why once it boots,\n\n162\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.640\nlook how small my screen is.\n\n163\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n164\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.560\n&gt;&gt; It's seeing this 1080p monitor and\nrendering everything and\n\n165\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.860\nnot doing the retina screen optimizations.\n\n166\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.712\nSo, I'm not seeing where one pixel\nis actually rendered as four pixels,\n\n167\n00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:30.069\nthat makes everything way\nsmaller than it should be Mm-hm.\n\n168\n00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:31.974\n&gt;&gt; And it's a little hard to see.\n\n169\n00:07:31.974 --> 00:07:36.617\nBut if I zoom in on some of this,\nlet me see if I can zoom in a bit and\n\n170\n00:07:36.617 --> 00:07:37.771\nshow you guys.\n\n171\n00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:42.679\nThe main menu that's appearing here, it's\nlike I said, it's focused on restore from\n\n172\n00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:46.900\nTime Machine backup, reinstall MacOS,\nfire up the disk utility.\n\n173\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.514\nThat's stuff you would do if you were\nhaving a problem with your computer.\n\n174\n00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:51.444\nI don't have a problem with my computer,\nit works fine,\n\n175\n00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:53.130\nI just want a firmware password.\n\n176\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.119\nAnd so\nif you go up top into your menus up here,\n\n177\n00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:59.198\nstashed away in the menus\nis a Utilities menu.\n\n178\n00:07:59.198 --> 00:08:04.180\nAnd under utilities,\nyou'll find the Boot Security Utility.\n\n179\n00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.960\nThat's the utility we need\nto enable firmware password.\n\n180\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.070\nIt's not available in the regular OS.\n\n181\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.970\nIf we just boot into\nMac OS it's not there,\n\n182\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.150\nyou have to boot your\nrecovery to get at it.\n\n183\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.230\nAnd once we fire that up,\nthe Boot Security Utility will launch, and\n\n184\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.494\nit'll tell you whether you already\nhave a firmware password or not.\n\n185\n00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:23.290\nI don't have a password, so\nit's offering for me to turn one on.\n\n186\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.800\nI love it, that's why I'm here.\n\n187\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.130\nSo I'm gonna come in and\nchoose to turn on that password.\n\n188\n00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.900\nAnd now, I get to pick what\nI want the password to be.\n\n189\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.790\nI picked an ultra secure password.\n\n190\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.350\nRemember, don't forget whatever password\nthis is, you want to pick a strong one.\n\n191\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nDon't forget.\n\n192\n00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:38.460\n[LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.230\n&gt;&gt; But where this one gets tricky,\nnormally, I'll pick a strong password cuz\n\n194\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.470\nI know like hey, I'm gonna use\nit everyday, I'll remember it.\n\n195\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.160\nAn interesting thing about this, you're\nnot gonna use this password every day.\n\n196\n00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.190\nWhen you push the power button,\nif the Mac sees that it's your Mac, and\n\n197\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.320\nit's your hard drive, and everything is\nyour stuff and you're booting like normal,\n\n198\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.210\nit'll just boot like normal,\nit won't even ask for the password.\n\n199\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.360\nIt's when somebody tries\nto boot a different way,\n\n200\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.510\nsomebody's booting off a different hard\ndrive, or they put a USB key on, or\n\n201\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.010\nthey're trying to boot to recovery.\n\n202\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.320\nIf they're trying to bypass\nthe normal boot process,\n\n203\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.460\nwhich is what a malicious person would do,\nthat's when it asks for the password.\n\n204\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.820\nSo now that that password is set,\n\n205\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.850\nI can hit Quit Boot Security Utility,\nthat will quit out of that.\n\n206\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.043\nAnd now, I can shut my computer down and\ngo about my business, right?\n\n207\n00:09:27.043 --> 00:09:29.680\nSo I'm going to do that,\nI'm going to shut my computer down.\n\n208\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.510\nSo I'm going to power off.\n\n209\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.370\nI'll give it just a moment to power off.\n\n210\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.450\nRemember, on some Macs,\nespecially if you have FileVault,\n\n211\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.000\njust because the screen goes black\ndoesn't mean it's actually off yet.\n\n212\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.360\nSometimes it's still\ncommitting changes to disk.\n\n213\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.390\nSo if you have a power indicator light,\nit's important to look at that.\n\n214\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.390\nI just looked at mine real quick,\nit's off.\n\n215\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.120\nAnd I'm gonna press that power\nbutton to turn it on, okay?\n\n216\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.030\nNow, when it powers on,\nI've got a firmware password now, right?\n\n217\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.980\nSo, it's gonna ask me that password.\n\n218\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.930\nWell, no it's not.\n\n219\n00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:01.460\nI'm gonna hit power, and it's seeing\nthat this is my Mac mini, my hard drive.\n\n220\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.710\nI've got FileVault and\nall that other stuff turned on.\n\n221\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.410\nIt's gonna boot like normal, and\n\n222\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.900\nit's gonna boot up and\ntake you to the login screen, right?\n\n223\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.770\nSo as an end user, I'm not inconvenienced.\n\n224\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.670\nMy normal workflow is\nexactly the same as normal.\n\n225\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.680\nI can come in and log in, and I work.\n\n226\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.520\nI don't notice a difference.\n\n227\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.640\nOn a positive side,\nI don't have to change the way I work.\n\n228\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.353\nOn a negative side, boy, is it easy to\nforget that firmware password because I\n\n229\n00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:27.310\ndon't have to use it, right?\n\n230\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.690\nAnd so, in normal operations,\nI don't have to use it.\n\n231\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.140\nBut then, one day, one day,\none day I need to boot to recovery.\n\n232\n00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.861\nOr I need to restore from time machine,\nso I'm gonna boot to recovery that way.\n\n233\n00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:40.476\nOr I'm an attacker, and I steal a laptop\nand I try and boot off my USB key or\n\n234\n00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.820\nboot off in Internet recovery.\n\n235\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.430\nThat's when it's gonna ask for\nthe password.\n\n236\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.350\nLet me show you that.\n\n237\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.740\nI'm gonna shut this system down again.\n\n238\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.550\nMy poor little Mac is probably\nconfused why I keep [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.427\nturning it on and shutting it off.\n\n240\n00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:52.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make up your mind.\n\n241\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.289\nSo I'm gonna shut it down, and let's say,\nlet's play the role of attacker, right?\n\n242\n00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.760\nSo I'm an attacker,\nI wanna break into this Mac.\n\n243\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.540\nI am gonna boot to Internet recovery.\n\n244\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.810\nOr I am gonna pop on a USB key and\nI am going to boot to that.\n\n245\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.860\nSo to boot from an alternate location,\n\n246\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.070\nI can boot from holding\nCMD+R to go to recovery, or\n\n247\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.102\nI can hold the option key on the keyboard\nto get to the boot menu, right?\n\n248\n00:11:13.102 --> 00:11:14.800\nI'm gonna do that,\nI am gonna hit the power button and\n\n249\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.580\nhold Option on my keyboard.\n\n250\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.690\nAnd so now, when it is powering on, it's\ngoing to see that I am holding option and\n\n251\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.300\nit is going to say I don’t want to\njust boot up from the main hard drive,\n\n252\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.870\nI want to give you the choice to\nboot from different hard drives, and\n\n253\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.608\nsee which one you want.\n\n254\n00:11:28.608 --> 00:11:30.980\nOr is it?\n\n255\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.201\nIt doesn’t give me a choice.\n\n256\n00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:35.130\nInstead, I get the lock, right?\n\n257\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.630\nThe lock appears, and the reason\nthat lock appears is it saying look,\n\n258\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.270\nthis system has a firmware password.\n\n259\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.430\nYou gotta punch it in.\n\n260\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.305\nIf you don't punch in this firmware\npassword, you cannot use this computer.\n\n261\n00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.580\nI've tried to alter the boot process.\n\n262\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.870\nSo if the attacker knows the password,\nit's not a big deal,\n\n263\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.170\nthey can just come in and\ntype it in, right?\n\n264\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.670\nI'm hoping I remember the password.\n\n265\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.760\nThey can punch it in.\n\n266\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.490\nBut if they don't know the password,\nthen it is a problem.\n\n267\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.750\nThey can't get past that.\n\n268\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.890\nEven if they replace the hard drive,\nthey can't get past that.\n\n269\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.530\nBut once they boot, now they're able\nto get into the system and it works.\n\n270\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.612\nIf they know the password right?\n\n271\n00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:14.627\nSo firmware password,\nnot difficult to turn on.\n\n272\n00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:16.910\nBut if you didn't know it was there,\nyou wouldn't use it.\n\n273\n00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:22.220\nBut once it's turned on, it does basically\nkill off the resale value of your Mac.\n\n274\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.340\nYour Mac is now exclusively locked and\n\n275\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.830\nonly you are able to unlock it,\nwith the help of Apple or your password.\n\n276\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.639\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nwhat if I already unlocked the machine?\n\n277\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.080\n&gt;&gt; You bring up a good point, right?\n\n278\n00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.840\nSo I push the power\nbutton on the computer.\n\n279\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.010\nTechnically, I'm already\npast the firmware password.\n\n280\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.020\nI get to a login screen.\n\n281\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.690\nI log in, and it's at my desktop, right?\n\n282\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.330\nSo if an attacker walks\nup to my computer and\n\n283\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.960\nthey see this Firmware password\ndoesn't help, does it?\n\n284\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.070\nRegular password doesn't.\n\n285\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.970\nNo matter how complex my password is,\n\n286\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.180\ndoesn't help if somebody can just sit\ndown and start using my computer.\n\n287\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.740\nYour user password is only as effective as\n\n288\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.160\nyour memory to lock the computer is,\nright?\n\n289\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.230\nWhen I'm done at the end of the day,\n\n290\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.130\nif I shut my computer off every day\nwhen I leave, then I know I'm protected.\n\n291\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.800\nBut if I have the computer sitting\njust like this and I walk off and\n\n292\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.320\nI go to lunch or I go home at the end of\nthe day, an attacker could walk up and\n\n293\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.130\nget any of my information from here,\nright?\n\n294\n00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.410\nAnd so, that would be bad.\n\n295\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.640\nThat's not something we want.\n\n296\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.380\nSo we need to make sure that our\ncomputer is never left unattended.\n\n297\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.870\nSo we need to lock our screen.\n\n298\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.500\nAnd the best way to do that, in my\nopinion the best way, is to set a timer.\n\n299\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.660\nTo say if my computer\nhas been inactive for\n\n300\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.080\na certain amount of time, lock the screen.\n\n301\n00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.600\nSo somebody has to have\na password in order to use it.\n\n302\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.750\nAnd you can set that easy enough\nif you go into System Preferences.\n\n303\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.670\nInside of System Preferences you\ncan go to Security &amp; Privacy.\n\n304\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.829\nAnd in Security &amp; Privacy,\nyou can go to your General tab, and\n\n305\n00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:51.105\nthere's this option right here,\n\n306\n00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:56.080\nrequire a password five minutes\nafter sleep or screen saver begins.\n\n307\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.510\nWhat this is saying is if the computer\nidles for a while and it goes to sleep, or\n\n308\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.940\nthe screen saver turns on,\nthen it's gonna require a password.\n\n309\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.260\nThese are the default settings right here,\nI didn't turn these on,\n\n310\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.020\nthis is how it was automatically set up.\n\n311\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.330\nThere's actually a little problem here,\nright?\n\n312\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.440\nThe problem in my opinion,\nis it's five minutes, right?\n\n313\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.560\nIf I walk away from my computer, and that\nscreensaver comes on, I might think yeah,\n\n314\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.960\nit's fine, screensavers on, it's locked.\n\n315\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.950\nBut it's not locked, and\nit won't be locked for five more minutes.\n\n316\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.170\nSo for five minutes I can walk away and\nsomebody will come sit down and\n\n317\n00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.580\nwiggle the mouse or touch the touch pad,\nit'll wake back up and it won't ask for\n\n318\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.020\na password, right?\n\n319\n00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.560\nSo if you really want to make sure,\nyou can take that and\n\n320\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.630\nchange it to Immediately.\n\n321\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.810\nIf the screen saver turns on,\nimmediately lock the computer.\n\n322\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.640\nAnd that way,\nif somebody tries to wake it up,\n\n323\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.440\nthey're going to have\nto put in a password.\n\n324\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.300\nAnd it's just asking me to punch in\nmy password, and I can set that.\n\n325\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.150\nYou can set it to five seconds,\nthat's kind of a nice one where\n\n326\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.270\nmaybe you're sitting there, and\nyou're reading a document, and\n\n327\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.751\nthe screen saver kicks on,\nyou can just hit the mouse real quick.\n\n328\n00:14:58.751 --> 00:15:02.730\nAnd then, that way doesn’t go to sleep,\nthat benefits people sometimes.\n\n329\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.435\nBut I can say immediately if I\nreally want to be strict about it.\n\n330\n00:15:05.435 --> 00:15:09.310\nThis is going to require that password\nin order for somebody to unlock it.\n\n331\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.720\nNow, it is telling g me that a log\nin password is set for my user, so\n\n332\n00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.450\nthat’s good.\n\n333\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.500\nIt knows and lock it.\n\n334\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.930\nBut this is all kind of dependent\non that screen saver or sleep.\n\n335\n00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.381\nSo you also want to verify back\nin your system preferences,\n\n336\n00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.976\nyou can go to Energy Saver.\n\n337\n00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:26.090\nAnd in the Energy Saver, you can see\nhow long it takes to go to sleep.\n\n338\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.570\nMine is set to what is that, ten minutes?\n\n339\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.560\nYeah, ten minutes.\n\n340\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.317\nSo if I forget to lock my computer and\nI walk away, I go to lunch or whatever,\n\n341\n00:15:33.317 --> 00:15:37.256\nin ten minutes the screen saver will kick\non, or the computer will go to sleep,\n\n342\n00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:38.771\nthese are my power settings.\n\n343\n00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.545\nSo my computer will go to sleep, and\n\n344\n00:15:40.545 --> 00:15:44.140\nthen somebody would have to have\na password to unlock it, right?\n\n345\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.276\nI can shorten that up if I want or\nI can lengthen that, but\n\n346\n00:15:46.276 --> 00:15:48.470\nit's that sleep that's gonna determine it.\n\n347\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.049\nThere's also the screen saver.\n\n348\n00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:54.348\nIf I go back to System Preferences and\nI go to Desktop &amp; Screen Saver, right in\n\n349\n00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:59.260\nhere, we can choose the Screen Saver tab\nand we can enable a screen saver, right?\n\n350\n00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.102\nAnd if you do that,\nit's actually off the bottom of my screen.\n\n351\n00:16:04.102 --> 00:16:05.835\nI'm zoomed in so far I can't see it.\n\n352\n00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:09.616\nAt the bottom of this screen it's got the\noption where you can specify how long it\n\n353\n00:16:09.616 --> 00:16:11.551\nwaits before the screen saver kicks on.\n\n354\n00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:12.117\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n355\n00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:14.950\nthat would be the other time\nthey would ask for the password.\n\n356\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.555\nSo you could set that and choose it.\n\n357\n00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:18.928\nIf your computer's going\nto sleep after ten minutes,\n\n358\n00:16:18.928 --> 00:16:22.088\nyou probably don't have a screen saver\nanyway so that wont take effect.\n\n359\n00:16:22.088 --> 00:16:26.268\nBut those are your different options\nthere, and so you can go in and\n\n360\n00:16:26.268 --> 00:16:27.730\nkinda tweak that.\n\n361\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:33.800\nI guess, here let me make my screen a\nlittle tinier, shoot it resized it again.\n\n362\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.060\nAll right, well, anyhow so\nthat screen saver option is there and\n\n363\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.250\nI can set it as well.\n\n364\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.530\nBut that's a great way to ensure\nthat your computer will always\n\n365\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.350\nbe prompting somebody for a password to\nget logged in, which is really critical.\n\n366\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.482\n&gt;&gt; Don, do we have to wait for the timer?\n\n367\n00:16:45.482 --> 00:16:47.540\nWhat if we're in a hurry?\n\n368\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.666\nDon, what if we're in a hurry?\n\n369\n00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:50.330\n&gt;&gt; I get this, right?\n\n370\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.421\nI know I'm about to go to lunch.\n\n371\n00:16:52.421 --> 00:16:56.220\nI don't want to say, eh, ten minutes for\nnow it'll lock itself, right?\n\n372\n00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.575\nSo you may wanna lock it\non your own manually.\n\n373\n00:16:58.575 --> 00:17:00.290\nAnd there's a few ways to do it.\n\n374\n00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.078\nI know the way I do it,\nwhich is not the most user friendly.\n\n375\n00:17:03.078 --> 00:17:07.712\nStarting with macOS Sierra, Apple finally\nintroduced a default key sequence that you\n\n376\n00:17:07.712 --> 00:17:09.850\ncould hit to lock your computer.\n\n377\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.301\nAnd they added it to\none of the Apple menus.\n\n378\n00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:14.437\nIt used to actually be kinda difficult\nto lock your computer, so waiting for\n\n379\n00:17:14.437 --> 00:17:15.770\na timer was the best way to do it.\n\n380\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.270\nSo there's a few workarounds if\nyou really want to achieve it.\n\n381\n00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.180\nLet me just show you a few.\n\n382\n00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.040\nIn 10.12 and higher, starting with\nmacOS Sierra under your Apple menu,\n\n383\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.930\nyou've got Lock Screen as\nan option right there.\n\n384\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.410\nSo if I know I'm about to walk away from\nthe computer, I can just hit Lock Screen.\n\n385\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.452\nOr you'll see where it's\ngot a keyboard shortcut.\n\n386\n00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.990\nAnd this is what I do.\n\n387\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.854\nYou can hit Ctrl+Cmd+Q, Ctrl+Cmd+Q.\n\n388\n00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:42.676\nThis one's always tough for\nme because it's really close to Cmd+Q,\n\n389\n00:17:42.676 --> 00:17:44.500\nwhich closes a program.\n\n390\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.740\nSo I might not want to\nclose the program I'm in.\n\n391\n00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.651\nIf I hit the key sequence wrong,\nthat might be a problem.\n\n392\n00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:52.430\nAlso shift+Cmd+Q which logs you out.\n\n393\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.557\nI might not want to log out.\n\n394\n00:17:53.557 --> 00:17:55.190\nSo you have to memorize it.\n\n395\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.665\nIt can be easy to mix up.\n\n396\n00:17:56.665 --> 00:18:01.164\nNow, if I just use Ctrl+Cmd+Q\nmy screen immediately locks and\n\n397\n00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:05.130\nsomebody would have to\nprovide a password to get in.\n\n398\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.373\nWe're not waiting for a screen saver.\n\n399\n00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:08.270\nWe're not waiting for it to go to sleep.\n\n400\n00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.167\nIt immediately locks.\n\n401\n00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:11.410\nSo that's one option that we can use.\n\n402\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.980\nThere are two options, right?\nMenu and key sequence.\n\n403\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.799\n&gt;&gt; So Don, what if I'm running\nan older version of macOS?\n\n404\n00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:20.243\n&gt;&gt; So they didn't have it in the menu\noriginally, so the old work around for\n\n405\n00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:23.920\nthat, and I don't have an older\nmacOS available right off hand.\n\n406\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.298\nBut if you go into a program\ncalled Keychain Access,\n\n407\n00:18:26.298 --> 00:18:28.740\nif you go into Spotlight and\nlaunch Keychain Access.\n\n408\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.920\nIn Keychain Access's preferences,\n\n409\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.333\nyou can tell it to show the lock\nstatus in the menu bar up top.\n\n410\n00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:37.790\nThat is a little Padlock\nicon up in your menu bar.\n\n411\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.300\nAnd when you hit that, it actually\nhas a lock screen option in there.\n\n412\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:40.878\nThat was the old way to do it.\n\n413\n00:18:40.878 --> 00:18:42.730\nIt was kind of a weird work-around.\n\n414\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.334\nAnd so Apple acknowledged that, and\nstarting with Sierra they said, look,\n\n415\n00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:46.960\nlet's just bake that\ninto our regular menu.\n\n416\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.662\nThat's where it is now.\n\n417\n00:18:47.662 --> 00:18:50.260\nSo most of us don't need to\ndo that if you've updated.\n\n418\n00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.014\nBut if you're still supporting\nolder versions of macOS,\n\n419\n00:18:53.014 --> 00:18:55.440\nKeychain Access is the way\nto get that one up there.\n\n420\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.990\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n421\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.450\nIs there anything else we\nshould be on the lookout for?\n\n422\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.315\n&gt;&gt; One more thing that kinda\ndefeat this whole process.\n\n423\n00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:05.227\nI mentioned in the beginning episode hey,\nif I've unlocked the computer,\n\n424\n00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.876\nit's now unlocked, somebody can get in.\n\n425\n00:19:06.876 --> 00:19:10.740\nAll my passwords are for naught and\nmy data gets compromised.\n\n426\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.963\nSo there's one more thing you can do the\nsame thing and that is automatic log ons.\n\n427\n00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:21.475\nA lot of people, especially older Mac\nusers or people that have used a Mac on\n\n428\n00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:27.820\na home environment may have the system set\nup where it automatically logs on, right?\n\n429\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.150\nAnd that’s not a good thing.\n\n430\n00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:33.652\nWhen I was in my system preferences here,\nand under privacy and security,\n\n431\n00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:37.656\nwhen we were taking a look at that\nrequited password immediately,\n\n432\n00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:41.317\nsee where it says a login password\nhas been set for this user?\n\n433\n00:19:41.317 --> 00:19:44.780\nWell, in macOS Sierra and\nHigh Sierra they require a password, but\n\n434\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.170\nwe have to have a password\non our user account.\n\n435\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.401\nSo there's never a time when\nthis would say something else.\n\n436\n00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:53.310\nIn older versions, though, you actually\ncould have a blank password if you wanted.\n\n437\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.641\nAnd it would warn you here cuz there's no\npoint in locking your screen if you have\n\n438\n00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:57.447\na blank password.\n\n439\n00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:02.231\nBut the other thing that's not mentioned\nhere is that you could actually set your\n\n440\n00:20:02.231 --> 00:20:06.920\nuser account so that when your Mac\nturns on it automatically logs you in.\n\n441\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.207\nWhich would not be a good thing, right.\n\n442\n00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Not a good thing.\n\n443\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.271\n&gt;&gt; So for example, I've got my user\naccount right here, Don Pezet, and\n\n444\n00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:14.463\nover here it's showing\nthat I've got a password.\n\n445\n00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.831\nI can change it if I want to reset that,\nbut\n\n446\n00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.670\ndown here I've got login options, right?\n\n447\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.126\nAnd if we take a look at the login\noptions you will see right here,\n\n448\n00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:26.774\nlet me unlock this screen so\nwe can actually read what it's saying.\n\n449\n00:20:26.774 --> 00:20:29.946\nWe look right here, Automatic login.\n\n450\n00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:31.804\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n&gt;&gt; If I turn Automatic login on,\n\n451\n00:20:31.804 --> 00:20:35.920\nif I drop that box down and I say,\nyeah, Automatic login as Don Pezet.\n\n452\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.439\nI'm punching in my password and I'm\ntelling the system to store that password.\n\n453\n00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:43.661\nSo now, if somebody steals my laptop-\n&gt;&gt; They're in.\n\n454\n00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:46.380\n&gt;&gt; They push the Power button, right?\n\n455\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.205\nIt moves past the firmware password,\ncuz it's booting off the hard drive.\n\n456\n00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:50.462\nIt logs in as me.\n\n457\n00:20:50.462 --> 00:20:53.330\nAnd now it's completely logged in.\n\n458\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.090\nAnd if I have that turned on and\nI lock my screen, all right, it's locked.\n\n459\n00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.053\nAll they have to do is shut the machine\ndown and turn it back on again.\n\n460\n00:21:00.053 --> 00:21:03.560\nAnd when they power it back\non what's gonna happen?\n\n461\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.681\nIt's gonna automatically log them in and\nthey get a-\n\n462\n00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.130\n&gt;&gt; This is not a god thing.\n\n463\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.450\n&gt;&gt; It's not a good thing.\n\n464\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.768\nThis option is designed for home users,\n\n465\n00:21:10.768 --> 00:21:14.070\npeople that have complete\ncontrol of their computer.\n\n466\n00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.844\nThey know no one else has\nphysical access to it and\n\n467\n00:21:15.844 --> 00:21:17.332\nthat's not gonna change any time soon.\n\n468\n00:21:17.332 --> 00:21:20.290\nYou can do automatic login,\nsaves you some time.\n\n469\n00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.109\nBut if you've got a laptop,\na Macbook that can easily be stolen,\n\n470\n00:21:24.109 --> 00:21:25.642\nif you've got a desktop.\n\n471\n00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:29.887\nIt's in an area that you don't have\ncomplete control over the people who have\n\n472\n00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:30.684\naccess to it.\n\n473\n00:21:30.684 --> 00:21:32.080\nBut this is a recipe for disaster,\n\n474\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.560\nit completely invalidates\nall the other passwords.\n\n475\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.747\nSo we need to make sure that automatic log\nin is turned off on all of our systems.\n\n476\n00:21:38.747 --> 00:21:39.650\n&gt;&gt; Indeed.\n\n477\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.275\n&gt;&gt; Certainly a best practice.\n\n478\n00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:43.865\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, and\nthis has been another wonderful episode,\n\n479\n00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:45.590\nsecurity feeders part three.\n\n480\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.353\nMake sure you see parts one,\ntwo, and three.\n\n481\n00:21:47.353 --> 00:21:50.830\nAnd there might even be a part four,\ncuz Don's got this look in his eye.\n\n482\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:51.757\nDon, anything else going on?\n\n483\n00:21:51.757 --> 00:21:55.159\n&gt;&gt; There's a few other ones that\nare really, I call them edge case type\n\n484\n00:21:55.159 --> 00:21:59.630\nsecurity features that not everybody uses,\nbut I probably wanna cover.\n\n485\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.420\nSo the first three here,\nthese were all super important.\n\n486\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.868\nEvery user is affected by that, everything\nthat I covered in episode one, two, and\n\n487\n00:22:04.868 --> 00:22:07.030\nthree, or parts one, two, and three.\n\n488\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.870\nBut in part four,\nI'm gonna cover some that are edge case.\n\n489\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.700\nThings like VPNs and\nother security features like that,\n\n490\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.709\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nfile vault and time machine.\n\n491\n00:22:16.709 --> 00:22:21.845\nIt's all a part of security, but doesn't\nnecessarily impact everybody the same way.\n\n492\n00:22:21.845 --> 00:22:24.197\nSo I encourage you to stay tuned for\npart four and watch it, but\n\n493\n00:22:24.197 --> 00:22:26.470\nit's certainly not as essential\nas the first three parts.\n\n494\n00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.305\n&gt;&gt; Well I can't wait, I love this.\n\n495\n00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.781\n&gt;&gt; Security features parts one,\ntwo, three, and four, and\n\n496\n00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:33.963\nmake sure you see everything inside\nthe Apple Certified Associate Series.\n\n497\n00:22:33.963 --> 00:22:36.735\nDon has done a wonderful job\nputting this together for you, and\n\n498\n00:22:36.735 --> 00:22:40.107\nall of that information is going\nto do nothing else, but help you.\n\n499\n00:22:40.107 --> 00:22:42.317\nSo that'll be great, and\nyou're inside the course library too.\n\n500\n00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:45.807\nThere's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n501\n00:22:45.807 --> 00:22:46.917\nhelp you go further.\n\n502\n00:22:46.917 --> 00:22:47.915\nSo check those out as well.\n\n503\n00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:52.637\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nyou know IT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n504\n00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:53.736\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n505\n00:22:53.736 --> 00:22:54.917\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n506\n00:22:54.917 --> 00:22:55.710\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n507\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:03.190\n[MUSIC]\n\n508\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.227\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.005\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.768\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:14.254\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.254 --> 00:00:17.100\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.180\nI'm Zach Memos and I'm your host for\nthis episode of Apple Certified Associate.\n\n8\n00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.990\nThis is security features part four.\n\n9\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.020\nYou demanded it, and\nwe're bringing it to you.\n\n10\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.600\nActually I'm not, Don Pezet is,\nDon, good to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.720\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.505\nAnd if you've watched the first\ncouple of parts to this,\n\n13\n00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.880\nwe've focused on security features that\nwere either turned on by default or\n\n14\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.650\nones that we could configure ourselves.\n\n15\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.300\nWe talked about stronger passwords and\nthings that end users need to do.\n\n16\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.550\nIn this, what should be final\npart of security features,\n\n17\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.500\nwe're gonna how we protect the data\nthat we store on our computers.\n\n18\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.272\nAnd we're gonna talk about a few features\nthat are found inside of the OS things\n\n19\n00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:56.990\nlike file vault disk encryption, and\nwe’re gonna talk about gate keeper and\n\n20\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.450\na couple of other neat little\npieces that are a part of MacOS.\n\n21\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.060\nSome are turned on by default,\nsome are not but\n\n22\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.020\nthey all worked together to try and\nmake sure that your data stays safe.\n\n23\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.610\nIf you don't know about these features and\n\n24\n00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.450\nyou don't turn them on, your data may\nnot actually be as safe as you think.\n\n25\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.180\nAnd your computer might be fine as long as\nit's in a controlled environment where you\n\n26\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.710\nknow who has access to it.\n\n27\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.027\nBut if you've got a computer\nin a untrusted environment, or\n\n28\n00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:22.754\nyou're worried about it getting stolen, or\n\n29\n00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:25.814\nlost, there is some extra steps that we\nneed to go to make sure that we're safe.\n\n30\n00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.560\nAnd we're gonna talk about those extra\nsteps right here, in this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Don, let's start with FileVault?\n\n32\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.070\nHow does it protect our data?\n\n33\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.499\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo what FileVault is,\n\n34\n00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.636\nI gave it its full name a moment ago,\n\n35\n00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:38.740\nwhich is\nFileVault Full Disk Encryption,right?\n\n36\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.430\nWhat it does is it encrypts\nyour entire hard drive.\n\n37\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.400\nAnd the goal there is to say look,\nmy hard drive.\n\n38\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.800\nWhen I power on my computer,\nmy data is there, it works great.\n\n39\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.300\nThings are fine, right?\n\n40\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.080\nAnd I've got it only I have access to it,\neverything's safe.\n\n41\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.520\nBut if somebody steals my computer,\nthey now have my data.\n\n42\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.160\nAnd they could just take a look\nat that hard drive and get at it.\n\n43\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160\nMaybe I've got a password.\n\n44\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.699\nWell, there's ways to bypass a password.\n\n45\n00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:08.380\nWe've talked about that in part two.\n\n46\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.440\nMaybe I don't have a password, maybe\nauto logs in and he can get at my data.\n\n47\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.940\nThat's pretty bad.\n\n48\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.250\nThat's not a good thing to do.\n\n49\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.860\nWe talked about that in part three.\n\n50\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.800\nBut another nice thing that we can do\nis we can encrypt all of our data, so\n\n51\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.940\nthat now, even if they rip\nthe drive out of your Mac, and\n\n52\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.510\nstick it as a secondary hard drive\nin some other computer they control,\n\n53\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.470\nthey still wouldn't be\nable to read the data.\n\n54\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.800\nHaving an encrypted hard drive\nmeans that if somebody steals it,\n\n55\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.530\nyou don't have to worry.\n\n56\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.270\nYou don't have to worry about them\ngetting access to your information,\n\n57\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.530\nbecause they would have to break\na significantly strong encryption key to\n\n58\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.500\nbe able to get into that disk.\n\n59\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.950\nAnd as of right now, even the NSA, the\nCIA, they don't have a means to do that.\n\n60\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.610\nAnd that's where there have been a very\nlegal battles between them and Apple.\n\n61\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.110\nThe encryption is very, very strong.\n\n62\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.980\nIt's using, at a minimum, AES 128\nencryption, which if you're not familiar\n\n63\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.787\nwith encryption standards,\nnot that big of a deal.\n\n64\n00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:05.500\nBut it's a really strong.\n\n65\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.560\nSo your data is very safe.\n\n66\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.870\nThis type of technology's\nnot unique to Apple.\n\n67\n00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.140\nThere's other competitors\nout there like VeraCrypt,\n\n68\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.890\nor Microsoft has BitLocker for Windows.\n\n69\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.720\nThey all work on the same idea.\n\n70\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.660\nThat a private key is generated and\ntied to your hardware,\n\n71\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.780\nsomehow, and then your entire\nhard drive gets encrypted, so\n\n72\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.720\nno matter where you put your\ndata on the disk, it's safe.\n\n73\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.250\nAnd then, if somebody tries to get at it,\nwell, then it's useless to them.\n\n74\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.800\nYour data stays safe.\n\n75\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.150\nSo this is becoming more and\nmore common on every computer.\n\n76\n00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.370\nIf you're coming from the Windows world,\nyou would know this is BitLocker.\n\n77\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.480\nIn the Apple, it's called FileVault.\n\n78\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.685\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds fantastic.\n\n79\n00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:45.670\nSo is it difficult to enable?\n\n80\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.820\n&gt;&gt; No, it's actually really easy.\n\n81\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.140\nAnd that's kind of the big\nselling point here,\n\n82\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.990\nis some technologies are hard to turn on.\n\n83\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.240\nThis one is super easy, but\nit's not on by default.\n\n84\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.210\nWhen you go and buy a brand new Mac,\nit has FileVault support built in, but\n\n85\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.200\nit's not turned on.\n\n86\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.190\nNow, if you install Mac OS yourself.\n\n87\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.540\nDuring the install, it'll ask you if\nyou want to turn on FileVault, right?\n\n88\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.480\nIf you say no, then it doesn't do it,\nif you say yes, it does.\n\n89\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.750\nBut most of us don't install MacOS.\n\n90\n00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.920\nWe get it on our Mac\nalready when we buy it,\n\n91\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.145\nor we deploy some kind of network\nimage that's prebuilt, and\n\n92\n00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:20.850\nin either of those situations,\nFileVault is not on by default.\n\n93\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.350\nSo we've gotta turn it on.\n\n94\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.080\nJust a couple of clicks and you're done,\nso it's not that big of a deal.\n\n95\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.090\nLet me show you here.\n\n96\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.995\nSo I've got this Mac, it's a fresh\ninstall of MacOS High Sierra, so 10.13.\n\n97\n00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:35.500\nAnd when I did the install,\nI just let it do all the defaults.\n\n98\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.810\nBasically, just clicked Next\na bunch of times and logged in.\n\n99\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.620\nSo with the default install,\nthe disk in not encrypted.\n\n100\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.751\nAnd you can always verify that\nby going into disk utility.\n\n101\n00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:49.452\nSo if I launch my disk utility and\nI come in and I find my Macintosh HD,\n\n102\n00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:52.102\nI can see right here that mine is APFS.\n\n103\n00:04:52.102 --> 00:04:54.280\nIt's formatted with the Apple file system.\n\n104\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.320\nYou might see MacOS extended journaled.\n\n105\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.445\nBut it just says APFS,\nit doesn't say APFS encrypted or\n\n106\n00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:03.260\nMacOS extended journaled encrypted.\n\n107\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.960\nSo it's not encrypted as it stands,\nFileVault is not turned on.\n\n108\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.420\nAnd if I go into my system preferences and\nI can go into security and privacy.\n\n109\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.600\nInside of security and privacy, you've got\na couple of tabs across the top one which\n\n110\n00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.540\nis FileVault and if I take a look at that,\nI can see FileVault.\n\n111\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.303\nIt secures your disk by encrypting\nits contents automatically.\n\n112\n00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:26.250\nBy the way, it's not turned on.\n\n113\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.560\nFileVault is turned off the disk,\nMacintosh HD, right?\n\n114\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.522\nIt's not on by default,\nI want to turn it on, okay.\n\n115\n00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:34.250\nNow in order to that,\n\n116\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.490\nI do have to be an administrator because\nthis affects every user on the system.\n\n117\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.330\nIf I have five user accounts,\nI'm encrypting the whole hard drive.\n\n118\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.920\nSo it affects every single user.\n\n119\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.650\nSo we do need to unlock our screen.\n\n120\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.820\nI've got mine zoomed in so far, the unlock\nbutton's off the bottom of my screen.\n\n121\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.560\nSo let me pop this out into\na different window real quick so\n\n122\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.420\nI can see the button that I need to hit.\n\n123\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.610\nThere we go.\n\n124\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So whenever you have something that\n\n125\n00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.860\nrequires administrative privileges, you've\ngot the unlock button down at the bottom.\n\n126\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.920\nSo I need to hit that so\n\n127\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.400\nI can authenticate and\nonce that happens, there we go.\n\n128\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.590\nNow I've got my FileVault option right\nthere, so I can choose to turn it on.\n\n129\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.278\nHow hard is it to turn on FileVault?\n\n130\n00:06:15.278 --> 00:06:18.755\nYou click Turn On and\nyou answer our quick question.\n\n131\n00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:23.960\nReally just one question, but that one\nquestion is really super important.\n\n132\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.320\nI mentioned there's a private key that's\ngonna encrypt this entire disk, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.100\nWell that private key, it can get lost.\n\n134\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.016\nAnd if it gets lost and\nyou don't know it, guess what you can do,\n\n135\n00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:37.675\nZach do you know what you do\nif you've forgotten your key?\n\n136\n00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:41.130\n&gt;&gt; There's really not much to do, but\nI suppose you go to the Apple Store.\n\n137\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.330\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou would think you can't even do that,\n\n138\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.130\nApple doesn't have a way to decrypt it,\nthey don't know what the key is, only you.\n\n139\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.100\nThis is the one time\nyou pick a private key.\n\n140\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.170\nSo, they give you two choices\nabout what you want to do.\n\n141\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.430\nStep one is,\nyou can use your iCloud account.\n\n142\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.232\nYou can use your iCloud account\nwhere they take the private key and\n\n143\n00:07:01.232 --> 00:07:02.294\nthey store it in your iCloud account.\n\n144\n00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:03.875\nSo as long as you can get into iCloud,\n\n145\n00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.989\nyou'll be able to unlock your machine\neven if you forget your password.\n\n146\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.889\nThe real solution\n\n147\n00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.420\nis don't forget your password,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n148\n00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.120\n&gt;&gt; So it's not a problem, right.\n\n149\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.142\nBut option number two, if you don't want\nto use iCloud, not everybody likes iCloud,\n\n150\n00:07:17.142 --> 00:07:23.025\nis all right, If I forget my password,\nhow about giving me a backup password.\n\n151\n00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:26.840\nIt's called a recovery key,\nand the recovery key\n\n152\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.640\nis kind of like a fail-safe that says,\neven if you forget your user password,\n\n153\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.960\nyou can still use this key to unlock\nyour machine and get in, all right.\n\n154\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.971\nNow if I choose iCloud, I'm already logged\nin to iCloud so it shows my iCloud ID.\n\n155\n00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:42.040\nI'll hit continue and\nit'll start encrypting the disk.\n\n156\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.080\nBut if I tell it,\nI want to use the recovery key.\n\n157\n00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.450\nWhen I hit continue,\nit's gonna generate my key.\n\n158\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.014\nAnd there's the key, all right?\n\n159\n00:07:51.014 --> 00:07:55.614\nIf I forget my user password, and\nI'm now locked out of my machine,\n\n160\n00:07:55.614 --> 00:07:59.505\nI could punch in this key and\nunlock my machine and get in.\n\n161\n00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:01.178\nThis becomes my fail-safe.\n\n162\n00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:03.815\nThis is a very important key to keep safe.\n\n163\n00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:06.480\nNotice how there's no Save As button here.\n\n164\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.610\nThey don't want you to save it as\na text file on your hard drive because\n\n165\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.180\nyou are about to encrypt your hard drive.\n\n166\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.283\nYou lose access to the hard drive,\nyou lose access to the key,\n\n167\n00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.219\nthat helps no one, right?\n\n168\n00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:15.400\nSo what they want you to do is\nthey want you to write this down.\n\n169\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.550\nWrite it down on a piece of paper, right?\n\n170\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.680\nAnd then lock it away somewhere.\n\n171\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.240\nLock it in a vault, a safety deposit box,\nsomething of that nature.\n\n172\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.425\nBecause if somebody else gets a hold of\nthis key, guess what they can do with it?\n\n173\n00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:29.380\nThey can decrypt your data and\nhave access to all your information, so\n\n174\n00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.660\nthis is a sensitive thing.\n\n175\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.856\n&gt;&gt; What about putting it on a USB or\nsomething?\n\n176\n00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can certainly do that.\n\n177\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.070\nAnd I actually do have some of mine.\n\n178\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.600\nThe thing to worry about there\nis what if somebody gets ahold\n\n179\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.050\nof that USB key, right?\n\n180\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.367\n&gt;&gt; Darn them [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:44.310\n&gt;&gt; I know, [LAUGH] it's always\nsomething to make things so difficult.\n\n182\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.137\nBut you can lock that USB key away, right?\n\n183\n00:08:47.137 --> 00:08:49.580\nHere, I'll reveal all my secrets.\n\n184\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.870\nI have a little fire safe at home which is\nwhere we keep things like passports and\n\n185\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.600\nbirth certificates, right,\ncuz you don't wanna lose those things.\n\n186\n00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.500\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n187\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.814\n&gt;&gt; There's a USB key in there.\n\n188\n00:08:57.814 --> 00:09:00.850\nAnd that's where I put all the encryption\nkeys that I need, stow them away, so\n\n189\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.370\nI've got them if I need them.\n\n190\n00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.054\nIf you don't have access to something\nlike that, there's other places like key\n\n191\n00:09:06.054 --> 00:09:09.950\nbrokerages where you can store these\nthings, or you can memorize them.\n\n192\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.970\nSome people just take\na picture with their phone.\n\n193\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.880\nI know I've done that on the show\nbefore just as a shortcut.\n\n194\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.039\nRemember that if you take\na picture with your phone,\n\n195\n00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:18.721\nsomebody could get a hold of your phone.\n\n196\n00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:19.790\n&gt;&gt; There's a record of it.\n\n197\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.770\n&gt;&gt; If you're using iCloud on your phone,\nit is going to synchronize up and now that\n\n198\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.470\npicture of your key is in iCloud, or\nDropBox, or wherever else you've sent it.\n\n199\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.660\nSo those are all things to be aware of.\n\n200\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.310\nBut the key thing I wanna mention here,\nno pun intended on that.\n\n201\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.050\n&gt;&gt; I gotcha.\n\n202\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.670\n&gt;&gt; Is that this is the only time\nApple's gonna show me this key, right?\n\n203\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.450\nSo I'm lucky because now it's captured in\nthis video forever that I can always go\n\n204\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.020\nback and watch this video and hey,\nhere's my key, woo-hoo, right?\n\n205\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:50.280\nBut the moment I hit Continue,\nI didn't write that key down, so\n\n206\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.990\nI've done a faux pas now because\nI can never see that key again.\n\n207\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.810\nIt'll never show it to me.\n\n208\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.520\nI'll have to go back and\nwatch this episode, right?\n\n209\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.210\nSo if you do what I just did, you'll\nhave to wait for encryption to finish.\n\n210\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.730\nAnd when it's done, you can come back and\n\n211\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.130\nyou can turn off FileVault, and\nit'll decrypt your disk and\n\n212\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.590\nthen you can re-encrypt it again, and\nthen re-encrypt it with all new keys.\n\n213\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.090\nSo that's it.\n\n214\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.830\nBut you'll never see that key again.\n\n215\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.690\nApple doesn't have it.\n\n216\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.080\nThey can't help you with that.\n\n217\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.180\nThey can't decrypt your system.\n\n218\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.130\nSo important that we remember it.\n\n219\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.190\nBut it's going to start encrypting.\n\n220\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.440\nMine's going right now, and\nit tells me I have two hours remaining.\n\n221\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.720\nI can use the computer.\n\n222\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.960\nI can sit here and work, and\ndo things, and browse the Internet,\n\n223\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.100\nall just like normal and it can run.\n\n224\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.850\nThe more data you have on your disk,\nthe longer this will take.\n\n225\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.600\nI know I have a Mac Mini in my office.\n\n226\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.670\nIt took about 12 hours to encrypt.\n\n227\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.560\nCuz that terabyte hard drive had\na bunch of video files on there.\n\n228\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.500\nIt took a while to encrypt that.\n\n229\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.340\nThis one, this is a fresh install so\nit won't take very long at all.\n\n230\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.230\nBut it will turn to encrypt.\n\n231\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.600\nYou can still use your machine, and when\nit's done, now your system is encrypted.\n\n232\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.140\nAnd when you login, things aren't\ngonna be very different for you.\n\n233\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.080\nYou provide your username and\npassword, you login.\n\n234\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.460\nIt's unlocking a private key in\nthe background but you don't see that,\n\n235\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.570\nthat's automatic.\n\n236\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.730\nAnd then you work like normal.\n\n237\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.060\nTo a regular end user,\nit's completely transparent.\n\n238\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.300\nSo there's literally no reason why you\nwouldn't want to turn this feature on.\n\n239\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.950\nThis is going to make sure that your\ndata stays safe, protected, and\n\n240\n00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.860\nthat even if somebody steals\nyour entire computer,\n\n241\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.480\nthey're not going to be\nable to get at your data.\n\n242\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.505\nAnd that is really, really mportant.\n\n243\n00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Is our system still\nprotected once we log in, Don?\n\n244\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.257\n&gt;&gt; So that's a really good point.\n\n245\n00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:29.348\nWe talked a little bit about\nthis in part 3, I think,\n\n246\n00:11:29.348 --> 00:11:32.042\nwe were talking about\nscreensaver timeouts.\n\n247\n00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:35.675\nThat, when I log in, my username and\npassword are being used to unlock\n\n248\n00:11:35.675 --> 00:11:40.500\nthe private key, which is then able to\ndecrypt and access data on the hard drive.\n\n249\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.350\nSo if I log in and\nthen I walk away from my computer,\n\n250\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.480\nI just leave it sitting here on the desk.\n\n251\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.920\nFileVault doesn't really help any more,\ndoes it?\n\n252\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.730\nSomebody could sit right down in front of\nthe computer, it's already been unlocked.\n\n253\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.050\nThey start browsing the hard drive,\nand ooh, here's some sensitive files.\n\n254\n00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.779\nLet me copy these to a USB key,\nand off they go.\n\n255\n00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:01.175\nRight, so FileVault protects us\nif somebody steals the machine,\n\n256\n00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:06.130\nif it's powered off, if we're not\nlogged in, or if the screen is locked.\n\n257\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.330\nBut if the screen is unlocked,\nyour FileVault is unlocked, right?\n\n258\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.500\nIt's like leaving the door\nopen to your house.\n\n259\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.210\nYou can have 12 deadbolts on it, but\n\n260\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.710\nif the door is wide open,\nthose deadbolts don't do any good.\n\n261\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.160\nSo that's what we have here.\n\n262\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.410\nSo we wanna make sure that we couple\nthis with a few other technologies,\n\n263\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.520\nthings like a screen saver timeout, right?\n\n264\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.740\nThat if I walk away from this computer and\nI idle for\n\n265\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.990\na little while,\nI wanna make sure that that screen locks.\n\n266\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.170\nI'm on the FileVault tab here.\n\n267\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.180\nIf I go back to the General tab,\nyou've got where how long to wait for\n\n268\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.850\na password if the computer goes to\nsleep or the screensaver begins.\n\n269\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.130\nAnd then you can go back to your\nsleep settings under Energy Saver and\n\n270\n00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.600\nyou can set how long it\ntakes to go to sleep.\n\n271\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.058\nFind a nice little balance there,\nso that when you walk away,\n\n272\n00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:51.830\nyour computer will lock itself and\nnow you know your data will be safe.\n\n273\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.040\nThe other thing is\napplications that we run.\n\n274\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.060\nIf I log in and I run an application, when\nI log in, I've already unlocked the drive.\n\n275\n00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.460\nAnd so those applications have\naccess to the drive as well.\n\n276\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:05.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n277\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.740\n&gt;&gt; And in an earlier episode we talked\nabout sandboxing, and how applications\n\n278\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.940\nonly have access to so much of the hard\ndrive, try and limit what they can do.\n\n279\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.566\nWell, that's true for\napplications that come from the App Store.\n\n280\n00:13:17.566 --> 00:13:20.284\nFor applications that comes from\nthird-party developer websites,\n\n281\n00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:23.270\nthey don't have that limitation,\nthey don't have that sandbox.\n\n282\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.050\nAnd so in theory,\n\n283\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.570\nI could have a rogue application\nthat's able to access all of my data.\n\n284\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.980\nAnd could then transmit that out over\nthe network and we have compromised data.\n\n285\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.939\nSo another thing you might wanna consider\nis back under our System Preferences,\n\n286\n00:13:38.939 --> 00:13:44.721\nif you go down to, I actually was in\nthe right spot packing preferences and\n\n287\n00:13:44.721 --> 00:13:46.490\nsecurity and privacy.\n\n288\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.778\nAll right, right here on this General tab\nwhere I was talking about the password\n\n289\n00:13:50.778 --> 00:13:54.810\nlock, at the bottom you'll see allow\napps downloaded from the App Store,\n\n290\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.520\nor App Store and\nidentified developers, right?\n\n291\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.336\nRight now,\n\n292\n00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:03.485\nI'm allowing apps from developers\nthat have a registered Apple account.\n\n293\n00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:06.778\nIn other words, they've at least paid\nApple 50 bucks and they've signed\n\n294\n00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:10.130\ntheir application, but their application\nisn't necessarily sandboxed.\n\n295\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.320\nThen they have way more\naccess than we need.\n\n296\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.730\nSo if we're truly concerned about\nsecurity, we might wanna flip that and\n\n297\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.660\nsay we're only going to\nallow apps in the App Store.\n\n298\n00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.889\nThose are all sandboxed.\n\n299\n00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:22.355\nThose are all put inside\nof these boundaries, and\n\n300\n00:14:22.355 --> 00:14:26.160\nthat helps to protect our data there\nfrom those applications as well.\n\n301\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.230\nSo that's another setting\nthat we may wanna consider.\n\n302\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.890\nNow obviously, if you have third party\nsoftware that you depend on, then you're\n\n303\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.940\nnot gonna be able to do that, right,\ncuz you need these other applications.\n\n304\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.500\nBut if everything you want is in the App\nStore you can really improve security by\n\n305\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.970\nbasically blocking any application\nthat didn't come from the App Store.\n\n306\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.120\nThings like ransomware and\nviruses become next to impossible\n\n307\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.040\nonce you have that turned on because\nthey're not coming from the App Store, and\n\n308\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.590\nso now your system is safe and\nyour data is protected.\n\n309\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.840\nAnd so it's like an extra\nstep that you may wanna do.\n\n310\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.660\n&gt;&gt; Don, does FileVault protect\nour network shares as well?\n\n311\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.720\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't.\n\n312\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.700\nSo if my computer is turned on and\nthe hard drive is unlocked, right, so\n\n313\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.240\nI'm logged in, and\nI share a folder on the network,\n\n314\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.060\nsomebody on the network could browse that\nfolder and start accessing the data.\n\n315\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.710\nAnd because they're coming\nin over the network,\n\n316\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.130\nthey don't even see the FileVault stuff.\n\n317\n00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.650\nThey don't know that it's encrypted or\nhave to deal with any of that.\n\n318\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.840\nThat's all transparent in the background.\n\n319\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.600\nDrive is already online.\n\n320\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.680\nSo that data is not secured.\n\n321\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.240\nRight, if you are on an untrusted network,\nlike a hotel network,\n\n322\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.180\nthat can be a real problem.\n\n323\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.970\nSo Apple has a couple of network security\nfeatures that are built in that are not\n\n324\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.950\nturned on by default, but you can.\n\n325\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.870\nLet me show you.\n\n326\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.110\nOne example here is this Firewall tab.\n\n327\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.580\nThe firewall that's built into\nMac OS is turned off by default.\n\n328\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.800\nIn other words, if I share a folder,\n\n329\n00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.650\nit's gonna be visible on my machine no\nmatter what computer network I connect to.\n\n330\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.680\nSo if I'm at home, if I'm at work,\nif I'm at a hotel, if I'm at a conference,\n\n331\n00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.136\nthat shared folder is being advertised\nbecause my firewall is off.\n\n332\n00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:58.572\nNow I might wanna turn that on to\nrestrict who can even see my machine,\n\n333\n00:15:58.572 --> 00:16:02.792\nand then who can even connect to it,\nbetter yet, access my data.\n\n334\n00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:06.614\nAnother option is that if I know I'm\ngonna be using untrusted networks,\n\n335\n00:16:06.614 --> 00:16:09.548\nwe can set up a VPN,\na virtual private network.\n\n336\n00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:14.050\nAnd back under your System Preferences,\nif you go the Network System Preference,\n\n337\n00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.580\nyou'll see a list of your physical\nnetwork adapters and then.\n\n338\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.790\nOops, this is another one,\nit's gonna be off the bottom of my screen,\n\n339\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.620\nlet me resize here.\n\n340\n00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.207\nAnd then down at the bottom\nyou'll see this little +/- and so\n\n341\n00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:30.992\nwe can add to add in\nan additional network adapter.\n\n342\n00:16:30.992 --> 00:16:34.273\nAnd when you do that it's gonna ask what\nkind of network adapter you wanna add.\n\n343\n00:16:34.273 --> 00:16:37.736\nAnd if we look at what's available\nyou'll see you can add a VPN,\n\n344\n00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:39.290\na Virtual Private Network.\n\n345\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:44.090\nNow, VPN isn't build right from your\nMac there has to be a VPN concentrator,\n\n346\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.090\na server basically, a network hardware.\n\n347\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.020\nThat's running in your home office or\n\n348\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.670\nyour business that your Mac is\ngonna reach out and connect to.\n\n349\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.600\nWhen it does that,\nit creates an encrypted tunnel, and\n\n350\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.710\nall of its data is being sent\nover this encrypted tunnel.\n\n351\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.060\nSo if you had a hotel or a conference,\n\n352\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.620\nnow your data that's being transmitted\nover the network is completely safe.\n\n353\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.030\nIn the security world, they call this\ndata at rest and data in motion.\n\n354\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.631\nFileVault protects data at rest,\n\n355\n00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:14.500\ndata that's sitting on your hard\ndrive gets protected by a FileVault.\n\n356\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.855\nBut once it hits the network, it's now\ndata in motion, FileVault doesn't do data\n\n357\n00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:25.380\nin motion, VPN does, VPN protects it\nwhile it's in transit, FileVault doesn't.\n\n358\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.266\nVPNs don't protect your data while it's\nsitting on the hard drive either, so\n\n359\n00:17:29.266 --> 00:17:30.630\nthey don't do the other way around.\n\n360\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.780\nSo if we combine these technologies we can\nend up in a situation where our data's\n\n361\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.820\nencrypted and\nsecured at every step along the journey.\n\n362\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.670\nBut you'll have to get with\nyour network administrators,\n\n363\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.760\nthere's a lot more involved in\ngetting that kind of thing setup.\n\n364\n00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.640\nBut it isn't there by default, and\nit's important to have that expectation,\n\n365\n00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.950\nto understand the limitation.\n\n366\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.900\nOf what FileVault and some of these\nother systems are even capable of doing\n\n367\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.530\ncuz there's only so much they can do.\n\n368\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.090\nBecause Apple doesn't know your network,\nthey don't know your data and\n\n369\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.920\nsome of the things that might\nbe going on behind the scenes.\n\n370\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.350\n&gt;&gt; But you have to have a VPN\nconcentrator available to you, right?\n\n371\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nit used to be dedicated hardware, so\n\n372\n00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.670\nat your business, they would have\nthis appliance that you VPN into.\n\n373\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.230\nThese days, it could just be a server\nthat are running Mac OS or Linux.\n\n374\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:19.510\nAlthough Apple, important caveat here,\nApple just killed of the VPN\n\n375\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:24.960\nserver in the Mac OS server app about\nthree weeks ago when this this filmed.\n\n376\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.910\nDepending on when you watch this\nit could be a year ago now.\n\n377\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.340\n&gt;&gt; It was April 2018.\n\n378\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.531\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\nwith macOS High Sierra 10.13 that was\n\n379\n00:18:32.531 --> 00:18:37.510\nthe first server version that\ncame out before it had VPN's.\n\n380\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:42.553\nI believe it was the server app 5.5 and\nthen starting with 5.6 and higher, the VPN\n\n381\n00:18:42.553 --> 00:18:47.260\nserver was gone, so Apple no longer\nhas a VPN server product of any sort.\n\n382\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.550\nSo you'll need a product from\nsomebody else, Microsoft, Cisco,\n\n383\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.710\nJuniper, there's a bunch of companies\nout there that make VPN concentrators.\n\n384\n00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.830\nIt's built into a lot of firewalls so\n\n385\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.490\nyour firewall hardware might actually\nhave VPN support built into it, or\n\n386\n00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.110\nyou can stand up a Linux server,\nit can create a VPN pretty easily.\n\n387\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:12.800\nOr you can install OpenSSL or\neven OpenSSH on your own Mac and\n\n388\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.530\nbuild up VPN Tunnels that way, so there's\na number of solutions that are out there.\n\n389\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.620\nBut Mac OS as of now just has client\nsoftware not server software for\n\n390\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.770\ndealing with VPNs.\n\n391\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.656\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information, Don well\npresented as usual, security features part\n\n392\n00:19:26.656 --> 00:19:30.940\n4, remember, there's parts 1, 2, and\n3, so make sure you see all of them.\n\n393\n00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.780\nBefore we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n394\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.760\n&gt;&gt; In these four parts, we've talked\nabout a number of security features that\n\n395\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.420\nare stashed away inside a macOS.\n\n396\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.820\nSome are important, some are not,\nit's up to you to look at all of them and\n\n397\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.080\nfigure out which ones you need and\nwhich ones you don't.\n\n398\n00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.580\nSome of them, like the macOS firewall,\nI rarely turn that on, I know it's there,\n\n399\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.870\nbut I don't necessarily need it so\nI don't usually turn that one on.\n\n400\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.858\nIt can cause some problems too, it can\nbe a little too restrictive sometimes.\n\n401\n00:19:55.858 --> 00:19:58.940\nSo you've gotta evaluate whether or\nnot you need each of these, and\n\n402\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.010\nthen if you do need it, figure out how\nyou want to deploy and configure it.\n\n403\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.610\nEverybody's needs are a little different,\nso take into account the software you run,\n\n404\n00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.510\nthe type of people that you work with,\nthe networks that you're on.\n\n405\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.260\nThat's all gonna influence which\nfeatures you need to use and\n\n406\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.470\nwhich ones you [INAUDIBLE].\n\n407\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.050\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Don thank you so much.\n\n408\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.630\nAnd now you know, Apple Certified\nAssociates, a wonderful series Don's put\n\n409\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.460\ntogether for you, make sure you see every\nepisode, you're gonna be so glad you did.\n\n410\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.640\nAnd guess what, it'll be in the course\nlibrary, there's thousands of other videos\n\n411\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.095\nthere designed to do one thing, help you\ngo further, check those out as well.\n\n412\n00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:32.680\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nyou know ITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n413\n00:20:32.680 -->

California.\n\n3\n00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.120\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.880\nempowering the world to engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.620\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of Apple Certified Associate.\n\n7\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.538\nThis episode, printing, that's right.\n\n8\n00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:25.100\nWe're gonna be talking about printing.\n\n9\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.170\nAnd the person that's gonna be helping us\nwith that is the one and only Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.370\nDon, good to see you, Sir.\n\n11\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.472\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:33.140\nAnd yeah, like you said, we're gonna\nbe tackling printing in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.260\nI know it seems like a kind\nof archaic topic to cover and\n\n14\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.120\nwith all of our technologies that\nhave changed so much over the years.\n\n15\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.220\nWhen I look at my MacBook,\nthe keyboard, right?\n\n16\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.040\nI've had a keyboard ever since my\nfirst computer that's been there.\n\n17\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.270\nBut instead of a mouse,\nI've got a touch pad.\n\n18\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.270\nInstead of a CRT, I've got an LCD.\n\n19\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.767\nA screen's changed,\nwireless networking, wired networking.\n\n20\n00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.000\nBut printing seems to be this one\ntechnology that just won't go away.\n\n21\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.980\nPrinting and keyboards, right?\n\n22\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.600\nThose are the two things we're stuck with.\n\n23\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.130\nIf you were in a business,\nthe odds are you need to print documents.\n\n24\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.610\nIt just happens, we need to sign things.\n\n25\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.040\nYou can do it digitally in a lot of cases.\n\n26\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.540\nSome companies have gone all digital,\nbut many,\n\n27\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.050\nmany organizations out there still\nrely very heavily on printers.\n\n28\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.820\nAnd if your printer doesn't work,\nit creates extremely bad experience for\n\n29\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.040\nthat end user.\n\n30\n00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.820\nAs a home user, we don't care so much,\nbut in a business, they are important.\n\n31\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.450\nSo in this episode,\n\n32\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.870\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about how\nprinting is managed inside of macOS and\n\n33\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.970\nhow we get that set up, to make sure that\nwhen we need to use the printer, we can.\n\n34\n00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.360\nThat it's there and\nit's all functioning inside the macOS.\n\n35\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.680\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nhow do we add a printer in macOS?\n\n36\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.100\n&gt;&gt; Fortunately,\nit's gotten a lot easier over the years.\n\n37\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.503\nIn the past,\nas we go way back in the past, right,\n\n38\n00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:47.141\nyou'd get a printer and it had to be\na printer that was made for a Mac.\n\n39\n00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:49.311\nThat a lot of Macs had\na SCSI port on the back so\n\n40\n00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:52.790\nyou had to run a SCSI cable to connect,\na special type of cable.\n\n41\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.778\nEventually, it started doing ones with\nparallel ports so you could do that.\n\n42\n00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:57.950\nAnd then they started moving through\nthese different types of ports.\n\n43\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.760\nIt was super annoying and confusing.\n\n44\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.190\nBut Apple has made some big moves\ninside of the printing world\n\n45\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.240\nto make it a lot more standard, and\nnow we don't really even have to sweat it.\n\n46\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.290\nWhen we go to the store to buy a printer,\nI don't even normally bother to even look\n\n47\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.810\nand see if it has Apple support or\nnot because it's all so common.\n\n48\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.140\nWhat really changed here is in the old\ndays, Apple used different hardware than\n\n49\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.640\neverybody else, so\nwe needed different printers.\n\n50\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.500\nBut now, Apple uses the same ports,\nthe same connectors as everybody else,\n\n51\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.820\nwhich is usually gonna be either USB or\nnetwork.\n\n52\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.630\nWith USB, it's just a USB cable.\n\n53\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.990\nYou get a printer with USB cable,\nyou plug it in and macOS sees this.\n\n54\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.470\nThat was one piece of the puzzle.\n\n55\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.350\nThe other piece of the puzzle\nwas the software, the driver.\n\n56\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.020\nAnd in the olden days, when somebody\ndesigned a printer, so if you were HP or\n\n57\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.560\nCanon, Brother, somebody like that,\nif you manufactured a printer,\n\n58\n00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.520\nyou had to write a driver to allow\nan operating system to talk to it.\n\n59\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.\n\n60\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.038\n&gt;&gt; And they would definitely\nwrite a Windows driver, right,\n\n61\n00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:59.810\nbecause 90% of businesses run\nWindows on their desktop.\n\n62\n00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.060\nSo we definitely want a Windows driver.\n\n63\n00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.430\nAnd then we look at it and\nsay, well, it's Macs,\n\n64\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.540\nthey're less than 5% of the market share,\nmaybe we'll skip that, right?\n\n65\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.679\nNot all of them.\nSome of them are like HP.\n\n66\n00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.948\nHP was famous for really working closely\nwith Apple so that macOS had tons of\n\n67\n00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:18.165\ndrivers for HP printers built right in,\nand they still do today, right?\n\n68\n00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.871\nBut the main problem was most companies\nweren't willing to write a second version\n\n69\n00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:24.810\nof their driver unless\nthere was a bigger gain.\n\n70\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470\nAnd so what Apple did with OS X,\n\n71\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.750\nis they released a system called CUPS,\nwith the common Unix printing system.\n\n72\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.153\nUnix is that operating system that's\nrunning under the hood, underneath OS X or\n\n73\n00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:40.060\nmacOS, right, so it's running BSD Unix.\n\n74\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.580\nWell, the Unix mentality is carried\nover to a lot of operating systems like\n\n75\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.410\nFreeBSD and OpenBSD Linux,\nall the big Linux distributions.\n\n76\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.540\nThey all are able to share this\nCUPS environment that Apple wrote.\n\n77\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.266\nApple wrote it and they gave away for\nfree to all these other companies,\n\n78\n00:03:57.266 --> 00:04:00.093\nall these other organizations said hey,\nuse this in your distribution.\n\n79\n00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:03.701\nIf we all use it,\nnow vendors can write one driver and\n\n80\n00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:08.120\nit works on all these different\nsystems and it's a big win.\n\n81\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.723\nNow they're not looking at us and\nsaying well, Apple's only 5%.\n\n82\n00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:15.820\nThey're saying if I combine Apple\nwith Linux with BSD with Android\n\n83\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.940\nwith all these other platforms,\nnow it's 10, 15, 20% of the market.\n\n84\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.250\nNow it's worthwhile to write that driver.\n\n85\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.830\nAnd so most vendors do write drivers now\nthat directly support the CUPS environment\n\n86\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.460\nwhich directly supports macOS.\n\n87\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.580\nSo the hardware is standard,\nthe drivers are a lot more common.\n\n88\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.010\nAnd that means when it comes\nto hooking up a printer,\n\n89\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.605\nusually we plug in a USB cable and\nwe're done.\n\n90\n00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:46.730\nmacOS automatically finds the printer,\nautomatically sets it up, and\n\n91\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.390\nwe're in business.\n\n92\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.930\nIt's all that it takes.\n\n93\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.330\nWe're connected.\n\n94\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.490\nBut that's if we're just using\nthe printer on one computer.\n\n95\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.122\nI'm plugging into my computer.\n\n96\n00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:56.952\nBut we don't normally\ndo that anymore either.\n\n97\n00:04:56.952 --> 00:04:59.850\nWe wanna share the printer\nbetween more than one computer.\n\n98\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.150\nIn that case,\nwe're gonna have a network, right?\n\n99\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.000\nThe printer might have\na network jack that's on it.\n\n100\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.760\nYou plug in a physical network cable or\nit connects to a wireless network and\n\n101\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.870\nnow it's on that.\n\n102\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.550\nSo in those cases, I have to go to my Mac,\n\n103\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.800\nand it's not gonna\nautomatically see the printer.\n\n104\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.490\nBecause I'm not plugging in a cable,\nI have to tell it, I have to go into my\n\n105\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.350\nconfiguration and tell it, hey, there's\na printer out there on the network.\n\n106\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.690\nAnd it can find it,\nconnect to it and get that put on.\n\n107\n00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.900\nSo for example here,\nif I show you on this machine.\n\n108\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.010\nI'm on a, this is a fresh install\nof high Sierra and if I go into my\n\n109\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.690\nSystem Preferences and I go into Printers\nand Scanners, I'll see my printers.\n\n110\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.595\nI don't have any.\n\n111\n00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:40.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a new system.\n\n112\n00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:42.436\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And I haven't plugged in a printer with\n\n113\n00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:45.070\na USB cable so it's not seeing that.\n\n114\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.550\nBut if I hit the little plus sign,\nit's finding nearby printers.\n\n115\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.370\nIt's looking at the network.\n\n116\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.040\nAnd it's seeing, look,\nthere's an HP Color Laser Jet M553.\n\n117\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.840\nThere is ITProTV Office.\n\n118\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.690\nThat's the printer that I use normally.\n\n119\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.417\nAnd then Tim's Office, ooh,\nthere's a printer in Tim's office.\n\n120\n00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:03.670\nSo we can have some of that.\n\n121\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.190\nSo it's finding these\nprinters on the network.\n\n122\n00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.260\nIt's looking out there.\n\n123\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.900\nIt's finding them.\n\n124\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.010\nIt sees them.\n\n125\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.425\nAnd if I wanna add one in like that\nprinter that I normally use is M506.\n\n126\n00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:13.910\nI can click on it.\n\n127\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.700\nAnd now it's talking to that printer.\n\n128\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.839\nIt's adding it in, and I'm done.\n\n129\n00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.610\nI didn't have to go and download a driver.\n\n130\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.660\nI didn't have to jump through hoops or\nanything.\n\n131\n00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.720\nIt already knew the printer was there,\nrecognized what it was and\n\n132\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.040\ngot it added in.\n\n133\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.117\nSo now, we're in business.\n\n134\n00:06:31.117 --> 00:06:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Are wired and\nwireless printers configured the same way?\n\n135\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.052\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I mentioned we could\nbe plugging in a physical cable or\n\n136\n00:06:38.052 --> 00:06:39.756\nwe could connect via the wireless.\n\n137\n00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:42.830\nA network connection is a network\nconnection to these printers.\n\n138\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.926\nSo when I look at this one,\nI connected to it over the network.\n\n139\n00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:47.190\nI actually don't know.\n\n140\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.840\nIs it wired, or is it wireless?\n\n141\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.360\nI'm not sure.\n\n142\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.551\nLegitimately, I'm not sure.\n\n143\n00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:52.244\nI'd have to go in.\n\n144\n00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:52.839\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n145\n00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.130\n&gt;&gt; And take a look at the front\n\n146\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.017\nof that printer.\n\n147\n00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:56.447\nThis is a business printer, so\n\n148\n00:06:56.447 --> 00:07:00.410\nthe odds are it's got a physical network\ncable plugged into the back of it, right?\n\n149\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; On a home printer,\n\n150\n00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.400\nlike the printer I have at my own house,\nthat one is wireless.\n\n151\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.030\nBut when we communicate,\nwe're using network protocols and\n\n152\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.170\nwe sort of saw that when I hit plus and\nit's showing these printers, right?\n\n153\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.140\nIt's finding them using different\nprotocols, and it might find them\n\n154\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.970\nusing Bonjour, which is a discovery\nprotocol that's built into macOS.\n\n155\n00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.660\nSo it might be using that to find them.\n\n156\n00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.070\nIt might be finding them\nthrough other technologies.\n\n157\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.730\nAnd when it's connecting, it's connecting\nusing another protocol called AirPrint.\n\n158\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.728\nAnd so I can see that's how\nI\"m connected to this printer.\n\n159\n00:07:32.728 --> 00:07:35.805\nBut if I start connecting to the other\nprinters that are here on the list,\n\n160\n00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:39.780\nI'm just gonna add each one in, we might\nsee different protocols show up in there.\n\n161\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.410\nAnd just because it says AirPrint doesn't\nmean that it's wireless, in fact,\n\n162\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.520\nhere let me do Tim's.\n\n163\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.869\nThe one in Tim's office I know is wired.\n\n164\n00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:52.002\nLet me, whoops.\n\n165\n00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:53.200\nShoot.\n\n166\n00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.653\nWell, You know what?\n\n167\n00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:59.240\nI'm trying to pick Tim's printer,\nand it won't let me pick it.\n\n168\n00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.760\nThere it goes.\n\n169\n00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.840\nAll right, I was thinking maybe it was\na duplicate of this other printer.\n\n170\n00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.960\nBut as I look here, see how each one\nof these are listed as Bonjour, right?\n\n171\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.142\nThey're being discovered with Bonjour,\nand I can choose it,\n\n172\n00:08:10.142 --> 00:08:12.252\nand I can connect to it and\nget it added in.\n\n173\n00:08:12.252 --> 00:08:14.990\nAnd once that's in place,\nthen we're up and going.\n\n174\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.940\nBut I don't actually see\nwhether it's wired or wireless.\n\n175\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.070\nThat difference would be\non the printer itself.\n\n176\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.750\nSo when I take that printer out of the box\nand I turn it on, if I'm plugging in\n\n177\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.430\na physical cable, I normally just stick\na cable in and that's it you're done.\n\n178\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.635\nBut if it's wireless on the printer,\nyou'll need to go into its settings and\n\n179\n00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:34.228\nsay here's my wireless network name,\nhere's my private key, and get connected,\n\n180\n00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:36.257\nand now that printer's available.\n\n181\n00:08:36.257 --> 00:08:38.130\nBut otherwise,\nwe're not going to see too much here.\n\n182\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.280\nIf it is a 802.11 A,\nB, G and AC, whatever,\n\n183\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.920\nthere's all these different wireless\nstandards, if it's one of those printers,\n\n184\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.960\nit just shows up like\na wired printer like this.\n\n185\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.490\nIt'll connect it.\n\n186\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.350\nIt'll use AIr print and\nyou're in business.\n\n187\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.920\nThe exception would be\na Bluetooth printer.\n\n188\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.350\nIf it's a Bluetooth printer,\nit won't show up automatically, right?\n\n189\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.370\nThese, it just found them,\nit sees them and they're here.\n\n190\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.530\nIf it's a Bluetooth printer,\n\n191\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.960\nI would actually have to go into my System\nPreferences, and I would have to go into\n\n192\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.080\nBluetooth, which, actually-\n&gt;&gt; You have to enable bluetooth on it.\n\n193\n00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm on a virtual machine\nwhich doesn't have Bluetooth.\n\n194\n00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:16.650\nSo let me go to my actual laptop.\n\n195\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.940\nOn my actual laptop, if I go into\nmy System Preferences here, and\n\n196\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.710\nI go into Bluetooth, here's where\nI can go in and I can scan for and\n\n197\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.430\nconnect any Bluetooth printers.\n\n198\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.440\nSo I would have to do this first,\nto see the printer.\n\n199\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.590\nAnd then,\nwhen I went back to the printer screen,\n\n200\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.960\nit would show up automatically there.\n\n201\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.689\nSo that's a little bit of a difference for\na wireless printer, but\n\n202\n00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:39.230\notherwise, they're set\nup pretty much the same.\n\n203\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.624\n&gt;&gt; What if the network printer we\nshared from a Windows machine, though?\n\n204\n00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:45.410\n&gt;&gt; In this case, it would work just fine.\n\n205\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.676\nAnd when Windows shares a printer,\nthey share it using SMB or\n\n206\n00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:48.980\nServer Message Block.\n\n207\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.950\nWe talked about SMB a little bit in\nthe file sharing episode because that's\n\n208\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.730\nhow we connect to Windows file shares.\n\n209\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.120\nThat's how we connect to\nWindows printer shares, too.\n\n210\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.620\nBut that's not the only protocol.\n\n211\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.340\nThere's other ones like IPP,\nthe Internet Print Protocol,\n\n212\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.730\nwhich is a standard across\nevery operating system.\n\n213\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:09.050\nSo on those Windows printers, they're\nnormally shared out with that identity,\n\n214\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.500\nso you're able to see them and connect.\n\n215\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.570\nAnd it's not really any different\nthan connecting to any other printer,\n\n216\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.730\nit will just show up in here.\n\n217\n00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.890\nIn fact, as I look at this list, again, I\ndon't necessarily know if they're wired or\n\n218\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.960\nwireless, I'd have to go and look.\n\n219\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.630\nI also don't know if they're being shared\nfrom a Windows machine or not, right?\n\n220\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.580\nSome of them I do know.\n\n221\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.200\nFor example, Tim's office, that one,\nthat's actually shared from his iMac, so\n\n222\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.960\nI know that one's attached to a Mac.\n\n223\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.780\nBut it could be attached\nto a Windows machine, and\n\n224\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.830\nI would just see it here by name.\n\n225\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.030\nI probably wouldn't see\nthat it was using AirPrint.\n\n226\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.840\nWhen you connect to a Window's machine\nit would use SMB or net bios or\n\n227\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.742\nsome other protocol like that.\n\n228\n00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:49.880\nTheir IPP would have a different name.\n\n229\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.560\nBut here, it's a Mac, so\nI can use AirPrint to connect.\n\n230\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, once the printer is added, how\ndoes MacOS know what features it supports?\n\n231\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.130\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwhen I connect a printer like this,\n\n232\n00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.040\nit has to figure out what software to use,\nokay?\n\n233\n00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.480\nSo, when I hit that little addition\nbutton, and I come in here and\n\n234\n00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.260\nI look at the printers that are available,\nit's discovering the printers.\n\n235\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.220\nAnd when it talks to them,\ndown here at the bottom,\n\n236\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.550\nsee how it says gathering\nprinter information?\n\n237\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.010\nAnd then, it says what are we\ngonna use to communicate, right?\n\n238\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.850\nSo here, it's trying to figure\nout how to talk to that printer.\n\n239\n00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.510\nAnd when it knows how to talk to the\nprinter, it can then ask the printer, hey,\n\n240\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.190\nwhat features do you support?\n\n241\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.590\nAnd then, it can add that support\nin here so we can see it.\n\n242\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.750\nAnd when I say features,\n\n243\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.853\nI mean things like maybe we've\ngot multiple paper trays, right?\n\n244\n00:11:35.853 --> 00:11:38.879\nA lot of times they'll have where\nthere's a letter or A3 size, and\n\n245\n00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:41.380\nthen there's legal size,\nlike a longer paper.\n\n246\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.940\nMaybe you've got cardstock in one drawer\nand regular paper in another drawer.\n\n247\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.010\nMaybe it has a folding unit in it.\n\n248\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.060\nSome printers are really fancy.\n\n249\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.980\nMaybe it's got a hole puncher or\na stapler built into it,\n\n250\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.810\nor a duplexer so\nit can print on both sides, right?\n\n251\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.990\nThose are all features\nthat the printer has.\n\n252\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.680\nWhen it talks to the printer,\nit tries to figure that out.\n\n253\n00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.270\nWell, if the printer supports AirPrint,\nAirPrint is a Apple protocol that they\n\n254\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.360\ndesigned that lets it talk to the printer\nand figure out exactly what it does.\n\n255\n00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.140\nAnd so, that'll usually take care of that.\n\n256\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.620\nBut if I drop that down,\nI'll see some other entries in here.\n\n257\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.860\nThings like Generic PostScript Printer.\n\n258\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.916\nOr generic PCL Printer,\nwhich is printer control language.\n\n259\n00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:26.520\nPCL and PostScript are two standards\nthat are applied to a lot of printers\n\n260\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.020\nthat are out there.\n\n261\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.990\nAnd if I don't have a driver, I can just\nuse one of those and talk to the printer.\n\n262\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.730\nBut the printer won't be able to tell me,\nhey, I've got three paper trays and\n\n263\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.245\nI've got a hole puncher.\n\n264\n00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:38.940\nIt won't be able to tell me that.\n\n265\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.780\nSo if I have to pick one\nof these generic protocols,\n\n266\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.380\nI'm not going to have all the features.\n\n267\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.100\nAnd sometimes, even with AirPrint,\nI'm not gonna have all the features that\n\n268\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.690\nif there's like a scanner\nthat's built into it,\n\n269\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.180\nif you've got one of those multi-function\nprinters that's got a scanner and\n\n270\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.420\na fax machine, well,\nAirPrint doesn't do scanning and faxing.\n\n271\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.070\nThat's separate software.\n\n272\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.110\nSo in those cases, if we have\nfunctionality that's not showing up here,\n\n273\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.480\nthen we may need to install\nsome additional software.\n\n274\n00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.260\nAnd you can usually tell\nby clicking on the printer.\n\n275\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.220\nAnd see the buttons that I've got here?\n\n276\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.730\nI've got Open Print Queue,\nyou're always gonna have that one.\n\n277\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.480\nBut I've got Options &amp; Supplies.\n\n278\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.130\nAnd if you choose that, I can see\nsome general options that I've got.\n\n279\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.333\nSo here, it's telling me\na little bit about the printer.\n\n280\n00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:24.850\nAnd I can see supply levels for\nits cartridges.\n\n281\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.570\nSo this is a color printer,\nit's a color laser, so\n\n282\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.550\nthese are all toner cartridges here, and I\ncan see what level its toner is at, right?\n\n283\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.610\nWell that's it, that's all I see.\n\n284\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.760\nI don't see anything else, like if\nits got a stapler, a hole puncher, or\n\n285\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.310\nfolding unit or anything like that.\n\n286\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.640\nMaybe it doesn't.\nMaybe it doesn't have those, right?\n\n287\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.200\nOr maybe it does, but the functionality\nthat's being presented via AirPrint or\n\n288\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.130\nthe generic driver is just not seeing it.\n\n289\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.940\nI might be missing something.\n\n290\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.506\nAnd I can click this Show Printer Webpage\nand it'll browse that printer's webpage.\n\n291\n00:13:56.506 --> 00:14:01.910\nAnd come on,\n\n292\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.600\nit's throwing a certificate warning at me,\nso let me get past that.\n\n293\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.070\nThere we go.\nI can get to the printer's webpage.\n\n294\n00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.390\nAnd maybe I look at it,\nand d find out that no,\n\n295\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.190\nit doesn't have any extra functionality.\n\n296\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.390\nIt just has this basic thing.\n\n297\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.710\nBut you may look at it and find out\nthat it does have actually a lot more.\n\n298\n00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:26.600\nSo as we kind of poke around in that\nprinter, eventually, here we go,\n\n299\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.730\nI can come in and I can start to look and\nsee what it actually has inside of it.\n\n300\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.540\nSo if I go to Device Information here,\nwell, not a whole lot of info.\n\n301\n00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.390\nApparently, the contact person is Philip,\nso I can call him and say hey,\n\n302\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:40.995\nPhilip what's up?\n\n303\n00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:43.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as you poke around,\n\n304\n00:14:43.029 --> 00:14:46.409\nyou start to find out what\nthis printer can do, and\n\n305\n00:14:46.409 --> 00:14:50.280\nwhether or\nnot it's got extra features in it, right?\n\n306\n00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.210\nHere.\nActually, down here.\n\n307\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.980\nMy head will cover up some of this.\n\n308\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.060\nThis is what I was looking for,\nis this one has three paper trays.\n\n309\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.980\nTray one, two, and three.\n\n310\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.930\nLooks like we've got tray one is\nsome kind of multi-functioning,\n\n311\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.560\nthat might actually be a loading slot.\n\n312\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.124\nBut then, we've got plain letter paper,\nand double plain letter paper.\n\n313\n00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:08.624\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n\n314\n00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:11.610\nBut either way, we've got a couple\nof different letter trays here.\n\n315\n00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:17.700\nNow, I didn't see the letter trays as\nan option when I was in my configuration,\n\n316\n00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.488\nwhen I was in here, I didn't see\nanything about those letter trays.\n\n317\n00:15:20.488 --> 00:15:26.300\nSo is it supporting those, can I use them?\n\n318\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.639\nWell, maybe not, right?\n\n319\n00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:30.410\nSo I might need to load\nadditional software.\n\n320\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.510\nAnd that additional software is gonna\ncome from the vendor's website.\n\n321\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.780\nSo for example, I can go to HP's website.\n\n322\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.390\nSo here is support.hp.com.\n\n323\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.710\nAnd I can search for that printer.\n\n324\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.132\nThat was a M553, is that what that was?\n\n325\n00:15:43.462 --> 00:15:45.180\nI think that's what that was.\n\n326\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.860\nLet's see, HP Color LaserJet M553, yep.\n\n327\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.162\nSo I'm gonna search for the M553.\n\n328\n00:15:51.162 --> 00:15:55.222\nAnd looks like we turned up two different\nversions of it, an enterprise printer and\n\n329\n00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:56.210\na managed printer.\n\n330\n00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.243\nI'll go with the enterprise one.\n\n331\n00:15:58.243 --> 00:16:01.515\nAnd there's a picture of that printer.\n\n332\n00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:03.440\nSo that's what that printer looks like.\n\n333\n00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.040\n&gt;&gt; A washing machine.\n\n334\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.330\n&gt;&gt; It does kind of look like a washing\nmachine, but you can see where the main\n\n335\n00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.840\nprinter is here and then there's these\ntwo paper trays down here, right?\n\n336\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.080\nMine had three paper trays.\n\n337\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.760\nSo probably a multi slot insert up here,\nor a built in tray, and\n\n338\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.660\nthen these two additional ones, right?\n\n339\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.200\nAnd that's not what it looked\nlike here in my settings.\n\n340\n00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.630\nHere, Apple's just assuming that\nI've got the default version up with\n\n341\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.875\none paper tray, right?\n\n342\n00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:32.290\nAnd so, they don't necessarily know\nthat it's got that second one.\n\n343\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.930\nAnd so back here, as I look at the\nprinter, there may well be drivers for it.\n\n344\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.366\nAnd so, if I tell it,\nI'm running Mac OS, and\n\n345\n00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:45.143\nI'll tell it that I'm running 10.13,\nand we can change.\n\n346\n00:16:45.143 --> 00:16:46.058\nThere we go.\n\n347\n00:16:46.058 --> 00:16:49.685\nThen I can look and there may well be a\ndriver for it, and here I can see I've go\n\n348\n00:16:49.685 --> 00:16:53.700\nHP easy start, some kind of software\nfrom them, I'm not familiar with it.\n\n349\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.640\nBut there's also some firmware and some\nother utilities that are available for\n\n350\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.970\nbeing able to connect and\nuse that printer.\n\n351\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.990\nSo, if we're missing features\nwe may need to download and\n\n352\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.142\ninstall some software like this.\n\n353\n00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:08.450\nI'm gonna go ahead and download this,\nit should download pretty quick.\n\n354\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.470\nAnd then what I like to do is before going\nany further with setting up a printer,\n\n355\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.110\nI've connected to all these.\n\n356\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.040\nI like to remove them, just get them kind\nof out of there, because you don't want\n\n357\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.290\nthe generic driver to take precedence\nover the one that we're about to install.\n\n358\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.319\nSo I'm just gonna remove it, this is\na different printer here, an M506, so\n\n359\n00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.373\nI'll just leave it alone.\n\n360\n00:17:26.373 --> 00:17:30.732\nBut I'm gonna take that file\nthat we just downloaded and\n\n361\n00:17:30.732 --> 00:17:35.810\nI'm gonna fire up whatever\nthis HP Easy start yes, right?\n\n362\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:40.940\nAnd looks like it is a little wizard based\nsystem here that I'm gonna walk through.\n\n363\n00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.850\nAnd it's gonna try and connect.\n\n364\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.600\nNow, it's looking to see is this\na printer that's directly plugged in,\n\n365\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.880\nor is this a printer that\nis on the wireless network?\n\n366\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.360\nSo it's going to look to be able\nto find where that printer is.\n\n367\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.955\nAnd my head's covering it little bit, but\n\n368\n00:17:56.955 --> 00:18:00.300\nthere's a Continue button down here\nat the bottom that I'm gonna hit.\n\n369\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.060\nThis little application is not\nscaling well to my screen.\n\n370\n00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.380\nSo there we go, scanning the network.\n\n371\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.150\nAnd see how this software knows\na lot more about the printers.\n\n372\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.520\nSo they're popping up here.\n\n373\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.917\nHere's a standard Laser Jet M553.\n\n374\n00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:16.606\nThat's a fancy pants printer right there,\nthe M506.\n\n375\n00:18:16.606 --> 00:18:18.646\nAnd then Tim's office.\n\n376\n00:18:18.646 --> 00:18:21.590\nSo each one kind of turning up here.\n\n377\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.290\nI probably want to install the updated\nsoftware for that one, don't I?\n\n378\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.120\nSince it looks so fancy.\n\n379\n00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.390\nBut I don't think that one's color.\n\n380\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.710\nSo let's go with this\none because it's color.\n\n381\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.650\nColor requires a little\nmore logic to work.\n\n382\n00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.700\nSo I'll choose that one.\n\n383\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.770\nIt's now talking to that printer, but it's\nnot saying: what kind of printer are you?\n\n384\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.210\nIt's saying, hey, I know exactly\nwhat kind of printer you are.\n\n385\n00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.850\nLet me just verify what paper\ntrays you have and other things.\n\n386\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.230\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna download the right driver.\n\n387\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.778\nAnd look at this driver, 249 megs in size.\n\n388\n00:18:45.778 --> 00:18:48.916\nThat means there's a lot of software\npacked in there with it .so it's\n\n389\n00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:51.320\ndefinitely adding some\nadditional functionality.\n\n390\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.145\nIf you've got a multi function printer,\none that has a fax or scanner in it, it's\n\n391\n00:18:56.145 --> 00:19:00.430\ngonna have even more software because it's\ngot to power all that additional stuff.\n\n392\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.510\nSo it's gonna get that installed and\n\n393\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.670\nonce it's in place, now I should have all\nof the functionality that printer and\n\n394\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.660\nbe able to take advantage of\neverything that's inside of it.\n\n395\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.280\n&gt;&gt; Can we share the printer for a Mac if\nwe want to make our own printer server?\n\n396\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n397\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.450\nIn fact,\nI keep seeing Tim's printer in the list.\n\n398\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.330\nThat's what he's done is he's got\nthat printer attached to his Mac for\n\n399\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.760\nsome reason, I'm not sure why.\n\n400\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.560\nAnd he's sharing it out on the network.\n\n401\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.541\nIf you take your Mac and you share\na printer out you just became a print\n\n402\n00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.592\nserver, and\npeople could print through you.\n\n403\n00:19:28.592 --> 00:19:31.630\nNow, I say I don't know why Tim did that,\nright?\n\n404\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.410\nWell, there's pros and\ncons to setting up your own print server.\n\n405\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.150\nLet me start with the negatives\nwhy you wouldn't wanna do it.\n\n406\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.776\nIf Tim shuts his computer down,\nnobody can print, right?\n\n407\n00:19:40.776 --> 00:19:43.110\nBecause it is then tied to his computer.\n\n408\n00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.190\n&gt;&gt; It's all tied together, yeah.\n\n409\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.340\n&gt;&gt; If we disconnected the printer\ndirectly over the network,\n\n410\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.620\nthen everybody can print even if\nTim shuts his computer off, right?\n\n411\n00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.550\nSo, that's a reason why you\nwouldn't want to do it.\n\n412\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:55.690\nBut a reason why you would,\nmaybe you have a color printer.\n\n413\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.070\nAnd you don't want people\nwasting the color ink, right?\n\n414\n00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:04.687\nOr you want to charge people for how many\npages they're printing, or you wanna have\n\n415\n00:20:04.687 --> 00:20:10.158\none logical printer that then sends to\na bank of multiple real printers, right?\n\n416\n00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:13.399\nThose are all scenarios where you'd\nwant to set your Mac up as a server,\n\n417\n00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:16.190\nand people would print through\nyou instead of going direct.\n\n418\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.901\nWhile I'm waiting on\nthe software to install,\n\n419\n00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:19.195\nI can kind of show you that process.\n\n420\n00:20:19.195 --> 00:20:21.100\nI can go back into my system preferences.\n\n421\n00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.520\nI'll take this M506 that I have added.\n\n422\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.260\nIf I wanna share that out,\nyou can highlight the printer you want and\n\n423\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.340\nright here you've got share\nthis printer on the network.\n\n424\n00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.854\nYou can check that little tick mark,\nand people start to see it.\n\n425\n00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:31.354\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n426\n00:20:31.354 --> 00:20:32.242\n&gt;&gt; And people start to see it.\n\n427\n00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:35.276\nIf you go in the, yeah,\nif you go into sharing preferences,\n\n428\n00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.370\nyou'll see printer sharing right here.\n\n429\n00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.200\nI could have come this way as well.\n\n430\n00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.530\nWhen you come into this screen this\nis where you can see printer view.\n\n431\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.640\nYou can come in here and\nyou can say who has what access right?\n\n432\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.290\nMaybe I don't want everybody\nto be able to print.\n\n433\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.300\nMaybe I just want me,\njust Don Pezet, I'm selfish.\n\n434\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.360\nSo I'm the only one I can print, so I get\nprint access, everyone else gets nothing.\n\n435\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.780\nNo access, right?\n\n436\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.730\nOr I can give them that print access.\n\n437\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.906\nYou've got that flexibility to dictate\nwho has what access on the printer that's\n\n438\n00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:07.039\nanother reason why you might wanna do it.\n\n439\n00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:09.310\nAll right, now my install on\nthe background must be finishing.\n\n440\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.610\nI just got this pop up saying\nthe system extension has been blocked.\n\n441\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.030\nAnd if I look, it's from HP Incorporated.\n\n442\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.510\nIt's the printer driver trying\nto install itself, right?\n\n443\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.410\nIt has to install a printer driver,\n\n444\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.650\na PPD file, and\na kernel extension for the software.\n\n445\n00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.500\nSo I'll need to go in and allow that.\n\n446\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.320\nIt should automatically\ntake you to the screen.\n\n447\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:29.960\nIf it doesn't,\n\n448\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.060\nyou might need to go to System Preferences\nand then Security and Privacy.\n\n449\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.490\nAnd then I'll see the message right here.\n\n450\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.050\nSystem software for\ndevelopers HP was blocked.\n\n451\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.500\nI need to hit allow.\n\n452\n00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.515\nAnd that's gonna clear\nit to allow it to run.\n\n453\n00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:46.494\nAll right, so it's gonna finish up its\nlittle install, and when it's done,\n\n454\n00:21:46.494 --> 00:21:48.617\nI'll have the full blown driver from HP.\n\n455\n00:21:48.617 --> 00:21:52.090\nNow it will probably take it a moment to\nrealize it's been allowed at this point.\n\n456\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.790\nThis is kind of a new\nthing in High Sierra, and\n\n457\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.090\nsome software vendors are doing\nbetter with recognizing and others.\n\n458\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.260\nBut, in a moment it'll be done.\n\n459\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.180\nBut in the meantime,\nI've now shared out my other printer, and\n\n460\n00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.560\nso people browsing on the network, they're\ngonna see that printer as being shared and\n\n461\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.840\nthey can connect to it,\nand make use of it.\n\n462\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.440\nNow if you're going to do that,\nif you're gonna share a printer like this,\n\n463\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.650\nyou might want to go in and\nchange the printer name, all right?\n\n464\n00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:25.429\nThis one is named really generic,\nITProTV_Office_BW_HP LaserJet M506.\n\n465\n00:22:25.429 --> 00:22:27.078\nSo that's kind of a big,\n\n466\n00:22:27.078 --> 00:22:31.680\nlong name that doesn't really\ndescribe the printer very well.\n\n467\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.695\nSo you might want to rename it to\nsomething a little more friendly, and\n\n468\n00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:35.625\nspecify a location.\n\n469\n00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:37.521\nBecause if somebody's\nprinting over the network,\n\n470\n00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:39.370\nthey might not even know\nwhere this printer is.\n\n471\n00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so you can say this one is located\n\n472\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:49.670\nin the business offices, or\nthird floor second conference room,\n\n473\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.990\nor whatever it is that describes exactly\nwhere that printer can be found.\n\n474\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.580\nAnd that's gonna help people to\nidentify which printer went.\n\n475\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.350\nWhen they see a list, if there's multiple\nprinters that are the same, that'll help\n\n476\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.930\nthem know that's the right printer,\nthey wanna connect to it and where it is.\n\n477\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.690\nAll right,\nlet's see if that driver's done.\n\n478\n00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.460\nIt is.\n\n479\n00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.845\nSo close, 93%.\n\n480\n00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When this driver's done,\n\n481\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.540\none of two things is gonna happen.\n\n482\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.020\nI haven't installed this driver before so\nI don't know which one is gonna happen,\n\n483\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.700\nbut many drivers will automatically\nset up the printer for you.\n\n484\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.280\nI fully expect that to be the case here,\n\n485\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.310\nbecause it asked me to pick the printer\nearlier, so it should add it for me.\n\n486\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.730\nBut if it doesn't, there are some\nprinter drivers where it installs and\n\n487\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.490\nit just installs the driver.\n\n488\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.490\nDoesn't actually set up the printer.\n\n489\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.610\nSo when it's done,\nyou might have an extra step,\n\n490\n00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.150\nwhich is that you need to go\ninto your printing preferences,\n\n491\n00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.310\nchoose to add a printer, and\nthen you'll see it on the network.\n\n492\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.330\nNow if you have to do it that way.\n\n493\n00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.660\nThis is done, so let me hit continue.\n\n494\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.900\nAll right, okay, good.\n\n495\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.658\nThis one is going to add the printer for\nme, so\n\n496\n00:23:47.658 --> 00:23:50.010\nI'll walk you through the other\nscenario in just a moment.\n\n497\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.710\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose to add a device.\n\n498\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.341\nAnd you know actually it already asked me.\n\n499\n00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:57.305\nGood it didn't ask me to pick out.\n\n500\n00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:58.502\nI thought that was odd.\nI was like why is it gonna ask\n\n501\n00:23:58.502 --> 00:23:59.045\nme to pick it again?\n\n502\n00:23:59.045 --> 00:23:59.910\nIt already had me do it once.\n\n503\n00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.797\n&gt;&gt; Because from the office\nof redundancy office.\n\n504\n00:24:01.797 --> 00:24:03.373\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:24:03.373 --> 00:24:04.139\n&gt;&gt; All right I don't need to\n\n506\n00:24:04.139 --> 00:24:04.729\nprint a test page.\n\n507\n00:24:04.729 --> 00:24:06.206\nI'm confident this is gonna work.\n\n508\n00:24:06.206 --> 00:24:08.481\nSo it's done and we are now all set up.\n\n509\n00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.996\nIt wants me to continue online to go and\nregister the printer but\n\n510\n00:24:10.996 --> 00:24:12.998\nI'm actually done so\nI'm gonna quit out of that.\n\n511\n00:24:12.998 --> 00:24:15.774\nAnd right here in my\nprinter settings I can\n\n512\n00:24:15.774 --> 00:24:21.240\nnow see the HP Color Laser Jet M553\nis showing up, that got added in.\n\n513\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.754\nThe icon is here.\n\n514\n00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:23.770\nThe icon's a little bit different.\n\n515\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.182\nIt still doesn't show that\nsecond paper here does it?\n\n516\n00:24:25.182 --> 00:24:25.751\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.\n\n517\n00:24:25.751 --> 00:24:28.340\n&gt;&gt; That just means they didn't\nupdate the icon I suppose.\n\n518\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.200\nBut under the kind,\nit doesn't say air print anymore.\n\n519\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.670\nNow it just says HP Color Laser Jet M553,\ncuz I'm using the official driver.\n\n520\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.510\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; And if I go into options and\n\n521\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.770\nsupplies, there's a lot more on\nthis tab then there was before.\n\n522\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.750\nBefore I had my general screen and\nthen I had supply levels and that was it.\n\n523\n00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now I've got options and\n\n524\n00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.050\nthere's my trays and my duplex unit.\n\n525\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.140\nIt found tray number three, apparently\nit didn't find a duplex unit, so\n\n526\n00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.080\nI don't have that.\n\n527\n00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.428\nTray number 4 and 5 are not present so\nthose aren't checked.\n\n528\n00:24:59.428 --> 00:25:02.650\nSo I could check off those features and\nfunctions if I have them.\n\n529\n00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:07.050\nAnd under utility it's got some link to\na utility which I've never seen before.\n\n530\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.010\nSo I'll fire that up and there we go.\n\n531\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.546\nNow I've got the official HP printer\nutility that let's me see all sorts of\n\n532\n00:25:12.546 --> 00:25:13.220\ncrazy stuff,\n\n533\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.111\nwithout having to go to the lame webpage\nthat was throwing up a certificate error.\n\n534\n00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:17.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is\n\n535\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.850\nthe software I'm supposed to use.\n\n536\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.233\nSee this is the way you're\nsupposed to do things.\n\n537\n00:25:21.233 --> 00:25:23.710\nSo that worked out pretty well and\nthere's my printer.\n\n538\n00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:28.150\nNow let's say that it hadn't\nadded that printer for me right?\n\n539\n00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:33.014\nIf that's the case we would need to add\na printer in, and when we go to add it,\n\n540\n00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:37.360\nit's gonna look across the network and\nfind the printers, right?\n\n541\n00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.938\nBut down here where it's got use, that's\nwhere it's trying to figure out what\n\n542\n00:25:41.938 --> 00:25:46.820\ndriver it wants to use, and see how\nmine is defaulted to secure AirPrint?\n\n543\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.180\nApple made AirPrint, they like it.\n\n544\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But if I expand that out, what you're\n\n545\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:56.550\ngoing to see in here are those generic\nones, as well as the actual driver for\n\n546\n00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:01.480\nthat printer and I've gotta choice between\nSecure AirPrint and the actual driver.\n\n547\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.030\nNow, why would I want Secure AirPrint\nover the actual driver?\n\n548\n00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.880\nSecure AirPrint is encrypted.\n\n549\n00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.384\nA lot of printer drivers\nare not encrypted.\n\n550\n00:26:09.384 --> 00:26:12.436\nAnd if you have HIPPA compliance and\nother things that you've got to meet,\n\n551\n00:26:12.436 --> 00:26:14.231\nit requires data like\nthis to be encrypted,\n\n552\n00:26:14.231 --> 00:26:17.250\nyou might need Secure AirPrint\nto guarantee compliance.\n\n553\n00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.010\nBut I'll tell you the HP printer\ndriver actually does encryption now by\n\n554\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.100\ndefault as well.\n\n555\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.730\nSo in this case I would\nwant to use that one\n\n556\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.960\nto make sure I was using\nthe actual vendor driver.\n\n557\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.600\nAnd then I just add\nthe printer like normal, and\n\n558\n00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.130\nI'll have it, all the functionality and\nfeatures will be there.\n\n559\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.130\nSo kind of a neat process there but\n\n560\n00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.222\nthat makes sure that we unlock all the\npower that's available for our printer.\n\n561\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.410\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job is always done printing.\n\n562\n00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.180\nAnd this is of course\na Apple Certified Associate Series.\n\n563\n00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.910\nYou know before we move on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n564\n00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.970\n&gt;&gt; You know printers are going away,\nright?\n\n565\n00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.060\nBut if you work in the business\nenvironment you are going to\n\n566\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.660\nhave to support them.\n\n567\n00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.310\nSo I know this kinda\nseems a little bit lame,\n\n568\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.730\nbut definitely familiarize\nyourself with the process.\n\n569\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.590\nI used an HP printer here.\n\n570\n00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.620\nCannon, Brother, Lexmark they all work\n\n571\n00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.770\nvery very similar you just go into\na different website to get their software.\n\n572\n00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:07.170\nIt's a good idea to keep the software\nhandy, and also I lucked out in that I\n\n573\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.870\npicked a printer that had a driver\nspecifically for MAC OS High Sierra 10.13.\n\n574\n00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.860\nThe reality is that the driver\ncould be as old as 10.7 and\n\n575\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.830\nit would still work as long\nas it's a 64 bit driver.\n\n576\n00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.310\nSo as long it's 10 point, pretty sure it's\n10.7 when we started the 64 bit stuff.\n\n577\n00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.190\nAs long as it's 10.7 or\nnewer the driver will most likely work.\n\n578\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.103\nYou don't necessarily have to\nhave the latest and greatest but\n\n579\n00:27:28.103 --> 00:27:29.958\nideally you ideally you would\nhave the latest and greatest.\n\n580\n00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:31.043\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Don, great job.\n\n581\n00:27:31.043 --> 00:27:32.620\nAirPrint's, awesome, I love that.\n\n582\n00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.473\nAnd again,\nthis is Apple Certified Associate.\n\n583\n00:27:35.473 --> 00:27:37.603\nIt's a whole series that\nDon's put together for you.\n\n584\n00:27:37.603 --> 00:27:40.553\nHe's worked very hard to make sure\nyou have all kinds of information\n\n585\n00:27:40.553 --> 00:27:42.520\nthat can help you now and in the future.\n\n586\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.400\nAnd by the way, you'll be in the course\nlibrary too, where there's thousands of\n\n587\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.730\nother videos designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n588\n00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.110\nCheck those out as well.\n\n589\n00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.267\nAnd tell us what you know about ITProTV.\n\n590\n00:27:52.267 --> 00:27:54.096\nYou know ITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n591\n00:27:54.096 --> 00:27:55.740\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n592\n00:27:55.740 -->

from\n\n3\n00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.165\nSan Francisco California with [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.470\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.044\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.097\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITPro TV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.390\nempowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.459\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with Apple Certified Associate.\n\n9\n00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.980\nThis episode,\nwe're gonna be moving content.\n\n10\n00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.885\nAnd the mover extraordinaire, the one and\nonly Don Pezet is here to show us the way.\n\n11\n00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:29.940\nDon, good to have you.\n\n12\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.906\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:35.018\nAnd like Zach said, we are gonna be\ntackling moving content, particularly\n\n14\n00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:39.270\nwe're talking about moving our data from\none computer over to a new computer.\n\n15\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.694\nSo for example if I have an old Mac and\nI get a new Mac,\n\n16\n00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:46.229\nhow do I transfer all my user\ndata over to the new Mac?\n\n17\n00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.700\nOr if I'm coming from the Windows world.\n\n18\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.942\nMaybe I'm a Windows machine and I want\nto get my data moved over to my new Mac,\n\n19\n00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:53.547\nhow do I go about doing that?\n\n20\n00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:55.496\nYou can do it manually\nwhich is really hard or\n\n21\n00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:59.186\nthere's some automated processes that we\ncan use that are built right in to Mac OS,\n\n22\n00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:02.260\nand that's were gonna be taking\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.233\n&gt;&gt; So, Don what is the official Apple\nprocedure from migrating our data?\n\n24\n00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:06.995\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n25\n00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:11.130\nwhat Apple wants you do is to use what's\ncalled their Migration Assistant.\n\n26\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.560\nSo they have this tool.\n\n27\n00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.779\nThis tool that can help to gather\nyour data, bring it over and\n\n28\n00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:20.443\nget that stuff moved over\ninto a new system, right?\n\n29\n00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:21.965\nThat's what they want you to do.\n\n30\n00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:26.375\nNow I'm using kind of soft\nwords there because officially-\n\n31\n00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:27.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:27.227 --> 00:01:29.300\n&gt;&gt; What they want you to do is take your\n\n33\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.961\nold computer down to the Genius Bar and\nlet them move the data for you, right?\n\n34\n00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.524\nWhich they can certainly do, right?\n\n35\n00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:39.193\nIf you're talking about one computer and\nyou just go down and you're buying\n\n36\n00:01:39.193 --> 00:01:41.833\ninto the Apple Store anyway, they can\njust knock it out for you right then.\n\n37\n00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.430\n&gt;&gt; And they charge you for\nthat though, yeah?\n\n38\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.257\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're buying a new Mac\nthey don't charge you cuz it's part of\n\n39\n00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:49.522\nthe purchase, right?\n\n40\n00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.520\nAnd that's fine at a small scale, right?\n\n41\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.885\nBut if you work for\nan enterprise, if you work for\n\n42\n00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.656\na company where you're doing\nthese things all the time,\n\n43\n00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:01.948\nwhere you're buying hundreds or thousands\nof machines, it doesn't scale very well.\n\n44\n00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:05.481\nYou'll spend most of you day down at\nthe Apple Store every week and eventually,\n\n45\n00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.895\nI don't know, eventually you'll have\nto type handsome little tiny hand.\n\n46\n00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:09.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we don't\n\n47\n00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.759\nwant that to happen instead.\n\n48\n00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.931\n&gt;&gt; He means that in a nice way.\n\n49\n00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.373\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And a handlebar moustache.\n\n50\n00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:17.092\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n51\n00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:19.583\n&gt;&gt; So instead we wanna be able\nto do this stuff ourselves and\n\n52\n00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:23.190\neven do it at scale if you have a large\nnumber of systems, and fortunately we can.\n\n53\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.849\nSo Apple does provide the same tool they\nuse down at the Genius Bar except you can\n\n54\n00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.258\nuse it yourself, it's built right in.\n\n55\n00:02:30.258 --> 00:02:33.781\nSo we've got that kind of functionality,\nit's right here,\n\n56\n00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:36.030\nit's kind of up to us how we wanna do it.\n\n57\n00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.452\nNow we don't have to go the official way,\nwe could go the unofficial way.\n\n58\n00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:42.069\nUnofficially I can just copy my data,\nright?\n\n59\n00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.562\nI mean if I have a bunch of\npictures on my old computer,\n\n60\n00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:48.059\nI can just copy them over to my new one.\n\n61\n00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:53.188\nAnd I can copy them via the network, I can\ntake a USB key or I can use cloud storage.\n\n62\n00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:57.447\nI can use iCloud or Dropbox or something\nlike that, and put my data there.\n\n63\n00:02:57.447 --> 00:02:58.850\nThen it doesn't matter\nwhat computer I'm on,\n\n64\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.540\nI've always got access to my information.\n\n65\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.357\nSo there's any number of ways to do it.\n\n66\n00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:06.269\nWe're gonna take a look, well,\nmost importantly, the ones that are on\n\n67\n00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.300\nthe exam, but secondly, though,\nthe ones that are officially.\n\n68\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.904\n&gt;&gt; But Don, do we always have to\ndownload the migration software?\n\n69\n00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.272\n&gt;&gt; You don't.\n\n70\n00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:15.609\nShoot, I'm gonna back that up.\n\n71\n00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.113\nYeah, pretty much you do.\n\n72\n00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I mentioned how the migration\n\n73\n00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.249\nsoftware is built into Mac OS, right?\n\n74\n00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:26.000\nSo if I take a Mac, here, I'll take this\none, so here's a fresh, clean computer.\n\n75\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.491\nI've got this running macOS High Sierra.\n\n76\n00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.618\nI haven't done anything to it,\nI haven't even done updates on it, so\n\n77\n00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:33.109\nit's running 10.13.3.\n\n78\n00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.820\n10.13.4 is out, but it's up.\n\n79\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.655\nHere it is,\nthis is my High Sierra machine.\n\n80\n00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:43.795\nDuring the install,\nwhen you're installing Mac OS,\n\n81\n00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:46.536\nit'll launch the migration wizard,\nsort of.\n\n82\n00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:48.582\nIt gives you a little screen, it says,\n\n83\n00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:51.198\ndo you want to move data\nfrom an existing machine?\n\n84\n00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.751\nAnd if you watch the episodes,\nreinstall Mac OS, I skip that, and\n\n85\n00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:56.140\nsay, I don't want to move anything, right?\n\n86\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.528\nWell, that's not your\nonly chance to do that.\n\n87\n00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:00.319\nYou can always go and run it again.\n\n88\n00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.930\nIf you go into your finder,\nand go into Applications,\n\n89\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.112\ninside of applications is a folder called\nUtilities, and inside of Utilities\n\n90\n00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:13.990\nyou'll find the Migration Assistant\nsitting right there, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.885\nSo it's built in.\n\n92\n00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.366\nNow what Zach asked was do I\nalways have to download it?\n\n93\n00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:20.340\nAnd that's because I've said this before,\nlike you need to download it.\n\n94\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.058\n&gt;&gt; It's right here, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:22.058 --> 00:04:26.271\nWell, Apple updates this thing\npretty frequently, right?\n\n96\n00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:29.191\nAnd when you're doing a migration\nthere's actually two systems\n\n97\n00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:30.470\ninvolved in the migration.\n\n98\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.676\nThere's the new machine,\nand the old machine.\n\n99\n00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:37.131\nThe new machine likely has the latest and\ngreatest migration system, or\n\n100\n00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.780\nat least a really new one, right?\n\n101\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.273\nBut your old machine either has\nan old migration assistant or\n\n102\n00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:45.270\nit doesn't have a migration\nassistant at all.\n\n103\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.212\nNow, if I'm migrating from a High Sierra\nmachine to another High Sierra machine,\n\n104\n00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:50.971\nI don't have to download anything.\n\n105\n00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:51.629\nI've got it.\n&gt;&gt; It's there.\n\n106\n00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:52.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's there.\n\n107\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.723\nBut if I'm going from a OS10 Mavericks\nmachine to a High Sierra machine, well,\n\n108\n00:04:58.723 --> 00:05:04.889\nthe migration assistant that's on the OS X\nMaverick machine is gonna be out of date.\n\n109\n00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.090\nI need to update it.\n\n110\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.630\nI need to download it and\nget it up to date.\n\n111\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.646\nIf my old machine is a Windows machine,\n\n112\n00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:13.529\nit definitely doesn't have\nthe migration assistant.\n\n113\n00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.961\nMicrosoft isn't too keen to package\nApple's migration assistant with their\n\n114\n00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:17.847\noperation system.\n\n115\n00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:19.500\nThey don't want you to\nmove over to an Apple.\n\n116\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.357\nSo you'll have to download it there.\n\n117\n00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:24.666\nI pretty much make it a habit of\ndownloading the migration assistant on\n\n118\n00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:28.213\nwhatever my old machine is, even if\nit's already got a migration system.\n\n119\n00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:30.560\nIt's nice to make sure you've\ngot the latest and greatest one.\n\n120\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.086\nSo by and large we're gonna go\nout there and download that.\n\n121\n00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:38.134\n&gt;&gt; Is there anything we need to watch\nout for when we're moving our data?\n\n122\n00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:40.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhen we run this migration assistant,\n\n123\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.292\nthe process is pretty straightforward,\nright?\n\n124\n00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:46.260\nIt asks us just a handful of questions\nabout how we wanna move our data, right?\n\n125\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.113\nAnd what it's gonna offer to do\nis connect to the old computer,\n\n126\n00:05:50.113 --> 00:05:54.565\ngather our information, and\nbring it over to the new computer, right?\n\n127\n00:05:54.565 --> 00:05:55.871\nSounds pretty straightforward.\n\n128\n00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.355\nAnd it's designed to be easy because\nthey want new Mac users to be able to\n\n129\n00:06:00.355 --> 00:06:01.488\nmake use of this.\n\n130\n00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:03.510\nBut there are a few little caveats,\n\n131\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.485\na few little things here\nthat might cause problems.\n\n132\n00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:10.684\nThe first thing, and I wanna state this\nright off the bat, It's not perfect,\n\n133\n00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:12.610\nit's not a perfect utility.\n\n134\n00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.702\nIt doesn't know exactly how\nyou used your old computer.\n\n135\n00:06:15.702 --> 00:06:19.296\nAnd if you did some nonstandard things,\nlike you saved some files in some weird\n\n136\n00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:22.020\nplaces, the migration assistant\nmight not know that, and\n\n137\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.600\nit might not know to backup and\ngrab that data.\n\n138\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.019\nIf you have an extra hard\ndrive attached to your system,\n\n139\n00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.134\nmigration assistant might\nnot know about that.\n\n140\n00:06:29.134 --> 00:06:32.850\nSo we don't want to 100%\ntrust in what it does.\n\n141\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.408\nWe want to, President Reagan said it,\ntrust but verify, right?\n\n142\n00:06:37.408 --> 00:06:39.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We want to trust that it does its job\n\n143\n00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:42.360\nbut we want to verify that all\nour data came across, right?\n\n144\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.351\nThere's also some things\nthat it can't migrate,\n\n145\n00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:46.121\nthings that it doesn't\nknow how to migrate.\n\n146\n00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:48.319\nYou might have custom applications or\n\n147\n00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.140\nsoftware that Apple\ndoesn't even know exists.\n\n148\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.388\nBetter yet, know how to move its data, and\nthat data might not come over properly,\n\n149\n00:06:55.388 --> 00:06:57.341\nthat's another thing to be aware of.\n\n150\n00:06:57.341 --> 00:06:59.729\nAnd then another little caveat,\n\n151\n00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:05.370\nif you run it during the initial\ninstallation, it works really well, right?\n\n152\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.495\nIt works really well.\n\n153\n00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:08.416\nIn my case I'm running it after the fact,\nand\n\n154\n00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.450\nthere's one little problem\nyou can bump into.\n\n155\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.938\nIf I had a user account on my old system\nand its name matches whatever name I've\n\n156\n00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:22.516\nlogged into here on the new system, it\ncan create a bit of a problem, all right?\n\n157\n00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:26.110\nNow, when you first do an install on\nMac OS it doesn't have a user account.\n\n158\n00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.394\nAnd normally it asks you hey,\nwhat's your username going to be, right?\n\n159\n00:07:29.394 --> 00:07:32.360\nBut if you choose to run\nthe Migration Assistant, it doesn't ask.\n\n160\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.436\nIt's gets your username from the old\nmachine and it brings it over.\n\n161\n00:07:35.436 --> 00:07:37.490\nThat's what the migration assistant does.\n\n162\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.536\nBut I skip the migration assistant,\nand I went ahead and did the install.\n\n163\n00:07:41.536 --> 00:07:45.080\nSo when it asked me my username,\nI put it on, I'm Dan Pezet.\n\n164\n00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.827\nWell, my old computer I'm\ncalled Dan Pezet as well.\n\n165\n00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:51.140\nWhen I try and bring that data over, it's\ngonna see that I've got a new account and\n\n166\n00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.920\nit's gonna fail.\n\n167\n00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.628\nIt's not gonna migrate over.\n\n168\n00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:54.719\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So If you've\n\n169\n00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:58.878\nalready created an account,\nmake sure the name doesn't match.\n\n170\n00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.030\nYou can change the name or\nyou can delete it.\n\n171\n00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.020\nYou can create a fake account.\n\n172\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.160\nThat's actually what I did right before\nthe show is I created a fake account\n\n173\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.525\ncalled Christopher Walken.\n\n174\n00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:08.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And made it an administrator and\n\n175\n00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:11.810\ndeleted my account so\nthat mine doesn't exist anymore.\n\n176\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.680\nWe just don't wanna duplicate.\n\n177\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.030\nWe don't wanna butt heads with\na duplicate name like that.\n\n178\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.610\nAnd then it can bring the account over, it\ncan actually bring over multiple accounts.\n\n179\n00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.738\nIf I had ten user accounts\nin my old computer,\n\n180\n00:08:20.738 --> 00:08:23.546\nit can bring all ten of them over and\nbring their data along.\n\n181\n00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:26.340\nBut if there's any duplicates,\nit will fail.\n\n182\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.040\nSo those are kind of little\nthings to think about\n\n183\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.600\nas a part of this migration process.\n\n184\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.545\n&gt;&gt; Well, can you show us\nwhat the process looks like?\n\n185\n00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:34.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n186\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.134\nnow there's two different pieces\nthat are going to occur here, right?\n\n187\n00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:41.360\nAnd one piece happens right\nhere on my new computer.\n\n188\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.610\nAnd the other piece happens\non my old computer, right?\n\n189\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.916\nNow what I'm gonna do here for\nthis example,\n\n190\n00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:48.715\nI've got my new computers\nrunning Mac OS High Sierra.\n\n191\n00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:52.110\nFrom my old computer,\nI'm gonna use a Windows machine.\n\n192\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.093\nSo I've got a machine running Windows\n10 here that is just a basic setup.\n\n193\n00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:01.414\nIt's running Windows,\nit has Internet Explorer on it and\n\n194\n00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:04.333\nI've created a bookmark for ITProTV.\n\n195\n00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:07.697\nI mean, you can create bookmarks for\nanything, right, so\n\n196\n00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:09.997\nmaybe I create a bookmark for cnn.com.\n\n197\n00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:13.870\nJust some basic things to show\nthat I've got some usage here.\n\n198\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.268\nSo I'll go ahead and\nAdd that to My Favorites.\n\n199\n00:09:17.268 --> 00:09:20.850\nThe blazing speed of Internet Explorer.\n\n200\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.080\nThat's things you don't miss from Windows.\n\n201\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.490\nMaybe we wanna be fair and balanced,\n\n202\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:30.680\nwe'll throw in Fox News as well,\nand get some good bookmarks there.\n\n203\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.210\nAnd so this'll be Fox News.\n\n204\n00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.380\nThere, all right.\n\n205\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.333\nSo I've got some bookmarks, these\nare things that people normally have.\n\n206\n00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:38.537\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n207\n00:09:38.537 --> 00:09:43.522\n&gt;&gt; I've got some other documents on here,\nso let me just show you in my\n\n208\n00:09:43.522 --> 00:09:47.900\nDocuments folder,\nI've got a copy of my resume, right?\n\n209\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.740\nSo the resume's sitting right here.\n\n210\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.483\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n211\n00:09:50.483 --> 00:09:52.948\n&gt;&gt; Very important, Don Pezet,\nEdutainer-at-large.\n\n212\n00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:54.170\nSo I've got that available.\n\n213\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.470\nI wanted that to come over.\n\n214\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.010\nMaybe I've got pictures, right?\n\n215\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:57.890\nSo I've got some pictures.\n\n216\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.210\nHere's me, here's Zach, right?\n\n217\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.050\nSo again,\nsome pictures that are available.\n\n218\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.451\nI want all this stuff to be brought\nover to my new computer, right?\n\n219\n00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:07.060\nBut my Windows machine,\nit thinks everything's fine.\n\n220\n00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.330\nLike, hey, I'm Windows.\n\n221\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.640\nWe're gonna run forever, right?\n\n222\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.119\nSo that's what it thinks.\n\n223\n00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:15.441\nIt has no idea that migration's about to\noccur, so I have to do some work here and\n\n224\n00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:18.270\nI also have to do work on my new machine.\n\n225\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.720\nIt's always best to start on\nthe new machine, all right?\n\n226\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.140\nOn the new machine, you're gonna\nlaunch the migration assistant.\n\n227\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.918\nIt's already got it so if you want,\n\n228\n00:10:24.918 --> 00:10:29.030\nyou can go and perform your Apple updates\nfirst to make sure you got the latest one.\n\n229\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.740\nBut it's got the one that's right for\nthat operating system.\n\n230\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.230\nSo I'm on High Sierra so\nit's the High Sierra migration system.\n\n231\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.687\nAnd when I continue forward,\n\n232\n00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:40.740\nit's gonna tell me I need to\nbe an administrator, right?\n\n233\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.000\nAnd I said I created a fake account\ncalled Christopher Walken so\n\n234\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.290\nI'm gonna log in as\nthat fake account here.\n\n235\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.350\nAnd that's gonna start the Migration\nAssistant, now watch what happens.\n\n236\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.550\nSee how my screen kind\nof changed a little bit.\n\n237\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.450\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; The High Sierra wallpaper went away.\n\n238\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.670\nThe migrations assistant just\nstretched and filled the screen.\n\n239\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.570\nAnd it took it a moment but\nmy top bar just went away and\n\n240\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.440\nthe dock went away, right?\n\n241\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.140\nIts effectively logged\nme out of the machine\n\n242\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.760\nto be able to do this import, right?\n\n243\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.869\nSo I'm now kind of locked out of\nthis machine, not permanently.\n\n244\n00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:15.797\nI could always just cancel this and\nhit the quit button down here and\n\n245\n00:11:15.797 --> 00:11:16.848\nthen go back to normal.\n\n246\n00:11:16.848 --> 00:11:21.438\nBut it's effectively kicked me\nout because it can't replace\n\n247\n00:11:21.438 --> 00:11:25.020\nfiles that are in use by\na user on the system.\n\n248\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.990\nSo it's made sure to\nmove everything else so\n\n249\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.410\nthat I'm not really occupying any space,\nright?\n\n250\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.950\nOr occupy any.\n\n251\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.300\nNow, it's asking what I wanna do.\n\n252\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.311\nAnd I've got three choices, all right?\n\n253\n00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:41.200\nThe first choice is,\nam I bringing data from another Mac?\n\n254\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.264\nIf I am, great, cuz the migration\nassistance is probably installed in\n\n255\n00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:46.062\nthe other machine, that's what I want.\n\n256\n00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:50.270\nBut they also say, a Time Machine backup,\nor a startup disk.\n\n257\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.241\nI don't have to have the other computer.\n\n258\n00:11:52.241 --> 00:11:54.838\nIf I have a Time Machine backup\nfrom the other computer,\n\n259\n00:11:54.838 --> 00:11:56.605\nI could hook that hard drive up here and\n\n260\n00:11:56.605 --> 00:12:01.060\nwe could migrate our data from the Time\nMachine backup, our data's there, right?\n\n261\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.940\nThat's really handy, especially\nif you don't have a new computer.\n\n262\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.720\nMaybe it's your old computer, and\nthings are just getting kind of slow or\n\n263\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.840\nwasn't running very well,\nand you say, you know what?\n\n264\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.250\nI'm gonna format this thing.\n\n265\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.420\nDo a fresh clean install of macOS on this\nthat's running nice and fast again, and\n\n266\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.550\nthen I'm gonna migrate my settings back\nin right from the Time Machine backup.\n\n267\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.200\nYou can do the same thing\nwith the startup disk.\n\n268\n00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.759\nStartup disk here normally means\nyou've taken another Mac and\n\n269\n00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:28.264\nyou've booted it into target mode.\n\n270\n00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:31.140\nIf you hold the letter T on your\nkeyboard while you boot up a Mac,\n\n271\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.700\nit boots into target mode.\n\n272\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.779\nNow it basically becomes\na giant external hard drive.\n\n273\n00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:39.141\nIt requires either Thunderbolt or FireWire\nto connect to do that, doesn't work over\n\n274\n00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:42.370\nUSB or network, but you can plug in and\nyou can bring your data in that way.\n\n275\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.550\nSo three different ways we\ncan bring that data in.\n\n276\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.350\nThe first way though, from a Mac.\n\n277\n00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.810\nThat means I've got an old Mac,\nit's turned on and\n\n278\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.300\nit's plugged into the same\nnetwork as my machine.\n\n279\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.260\nSo that's what that first one is saying.\n\n280\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.090\nThe second one is from a Windows PC and\nthat's what I'm doing.\n\n281\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.660\nAnd again, it's assuming I've got\na Windows PC, it's turned on and\n\n282\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.031\nit's connected to the same\nnetwork as my Mac.\n\n283\n00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.252\nThey need to be able to see each other,\nright?\n\n284\n00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:11.460\nBut, migrating from a Mac and migrating\nfrom a Windows PC are basically the same.\n\n285\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.417\nMigrating from Time Machine or\nstartup disk, those are different.\n\n286\n00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:18.299\nThe last option here is to another Mac,\nall right?\n\n287\n00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:21.930\nFrom means that I'm on the new computer.\n\n288\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.580\nTo means I'm on the old computer.\n\n289\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.900\nOn the old computer,\nI want to send my stuff to another Mac.\n\n290\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.020\nAnd I can't send it to a PC.\n\n291\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.810\nApple doesn't want us to convert to a PC.\n\n292\n00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.709\nI can only send to a Mac.\n\n293\n00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:35.720\nSo for this one,\nI wanna do from a Windows PC.\n\n294\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.125\nSo I'm gonna choose that and\nI will move forward.\n\n295\n00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:46.170\nAll right, now what's happening is my\nMac is starting to scan the network.\n\n296\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.775\nIt's scanning the network and\nit's looking for\n\n297\n00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:52.088\nany other machine that's running\nthe migration assistant.\n\n298\n00:13:52.088 --> 00:13:54.010\nAnd it's saying, all right,\nwho's running the migration assistant?\n\n299\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.148\nWho's gonna send me some data?\n\n300\n00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:57.671\nAnd we're just listening.\n\n301\n00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:01.955\nNow if my other machines a Mac, I would\njump over to the Mac and I would fire up\n\n302\n00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:07.270\nthe migration assistant and I would say\nto another PC, right, or to another Mac.\n\n303\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.160\nBut in my case,\n\n304\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.770\nmy other machine is a Windows machine and\nso right down here it gives me a link.\n\n305\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:18.510\nIt says I need to go to\nwww.apple.com/migrate-to-mac.\n\n306\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.490\nSo, I'm gonna go over to my Windows\nmachine, and I'll fire up a web browser.\n\n307\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.261\nAnd we're just gonna browse to\n\n308\n00:14:27.261 --> 00:14:33.700\nwww.apple.com/migrate-to-mac.\n\n309\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.440\nAnd when I get there,\nit's gonna send me to this page.\n\n310\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:42.130\nNow, notice how the URL changed up here,\nit changed to a knowledge base DL1557.\n\n311\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.129\nIt's important when you browse to this\npage that you use the URL that Apple is\n\n312\n00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.892\ntelling you.\n\n313\n00:14:46.892 --> 00:14:47.790\nThis one right here.\n\n314\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.440\nThat's an alias URL that's always going\nto point to the latest version of\n\n315\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.570\nthe migration assistant.\n\n316\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.400\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n317\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.280\n&gt;&gt; If you use the URL\nthat's on my screen here,\n\n318\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.560\nthat's going to take you to\nthe migration assistant 2.0.5.0.\n\n319\n00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.390\nWell, as of the filming of this episode,\nthat's the latest one.\n\n320\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.454\nBut by the time you're watching this,\nthere may be a new one.\n\n321\n00:15:06.454 --> 00:15:09.100\nAll right, so you want to make sure you\nget the latest one using the alias URL to\n\n322\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.350\nmake sure that you get there.\n\n323\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.077\nAnd they do update it from time to time.\n\n324\n00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.849\nSo for example,\nthis is the current migration assistant,\n\n325\n00:15:14.849 --> 00:15:16.408\nthis is the one that I want to run.\n\n326\n00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:19.546\nBut right down here at the bottom,\nyou can see,\n\n327\n00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:24.336\nclick this link to download\nthe migration assistant 1.0.5.7 for\n\n328\n00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:27.478\ntransferring from\nWindows XP Service Pack 3 or\n\n329\n00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:31.290\nlater to macOS 10.7 all\nthe way through 10.11.\n\n330\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.527\nSo if we're doing 10.12 or 13, right?\n\n331\n00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:38.129\nIf we're doing Sierra and\nHigh Sierra, we don't wanna use that,\n\n332\n00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:40.390\nwe wanna make sure we use\nthe newer migration assistant.\n\n333\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.364\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They do release updates to these, so\n\n334\n00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:44.824\nmake sure that you're\ngetting the most recent one.\n\n335\n00:15:44.824 --> 00:15:47.200\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Download on that.\n\n336\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.243\nAnd it's gonna download the assistant.\n\n337\n00:15:48.243 --> 00:15:50.130\nThe assistant is not very big.\n\n338\n00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.424\nSo it's a 5.1 megabytes, I'll go ahead and\nsave that to my hard drive.\n\n339\n00:15:55.424 --> 00:15:58.310\nAnd once it's saved down, I can run it.\n\n340\n00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.677\nAnd running it is a pretty\nstraightforward process,\n\n341\n00:16:00.677 --> 00:16:03.025\nit doesn't ask us a whole\nheck of a lot of questions.\n\n342\n00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.136\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna pop up, and\n\n343\n00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:06.570\nlet me just close all of\nthis other stuff here.\n\n344\n00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.538\nIt's gonna pop up and\nbasically start the wizard,\n\n345\n00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:13.620\nit's gonna ask me to accept a licensing\nagreement because, why not?\n\n346\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.540\nAnd we'll let that software install.\n\n347\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.010\nAnd once it's installed,\n\n348\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.904\nwe'll actually be able to run\nthe actual migration assistant.\n\n349\n00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:22.460\nSo it's gonna install here.\n\n350\n00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.753\nI don't believe it requires a reboot,\nit should just get\n\n351\n00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:29.744\non there after I clear my administrative\nhurdles here, there we go.\n\n352\n00:16:29.744 --> 00:16:31.430\nAnd now I'm ready to run it.\n\n353\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.640\nAnd so it's asking to make changes\nto my device, I'll say yes to that.\n\n354\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.160\nAnd now, now it's gonna tell me\nthat I need the .NET Framework.\n\n355\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.187\nThis is another kind of frustrating\npart about Windows, sometimes.\n\n356\n00:16:42.187 --> 00:16:45.322\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and tell it to\ndownload and install that feature, so\n\n357\n00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:46.750\nthat it has the .NET Framework.\n\n358\n00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.017\nIf you're not familiar\nwith the .NET Framework,\n\n359\n00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:52.719\nit's a collection of libraries and support\nfiles that allow applications to run.\n\n360\n00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:56.559\nWhen you're writing an application, and\nyou wanna stick a button on the screen,\n\n361\n00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:59.580\nyou're not the first person in\nthe world to create buttons.\n\n362\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.661\nSo you can copy a button somebody else has\nalready made, the .NET Framework is packed\n\n363\n00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:05.601\nfull of stuff like that-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n364\n00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:07.840\nthe migration assistant is using it.\n\n365\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.322\nSo it's gonna download and install that.\n\n366\n00:17:10.322 --> 00:17:13.077\nWhile we're waiting on it, let me jump\nback over to the other machine, and\n\n367\n00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:16.120\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n368\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.157\nWhen I run the migration assistant on\nmy Windows machine, it's gonna look at\n\n369\n00:17:21.157 --> 00:17:26.439\nthe network and say hey, I'm here, I' m\ntrying to find somebody to deposit to.\n\n370\n00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:32.460\nAnd my new Mac is gonna find that source,\nit's gonna see it right here, okay?\n\n371\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.165\nBut it doesn't start transferring\nautomatically, and the reason is I might\n\n372\n00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:39.933\nhave more than one computer on the network\nrunning this migration assistant.\n\n373\n00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:42.710\nI might be doing ten different\ncomputers at the same time.\n\n374\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.523\nSo how does it know\nwhich one to send where?\n\n375\n00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:46.240\nIt doesn't, it's up to us to tell it.\n\n376\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.637\nWe have to come and find that spot, right?\n\n377\n00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:52.900\nThe other thing is, what if there's\nan attacker on your network?\n\n378\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.660\nSome malicious user, someone who's just\nwaiting for a chance to come in and\n\n379\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.552\nsteal your data.\n\n380\n00:17:57.552 --> 00:18:01.297\nThey could wait and see when I\nlaunch the migration assistant and\n\n381\n00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:04.290\nstart running it, and\nit's looking to transmit.\n\n382\n00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.001\nAnd they could bring up their own machine\nand say yep, I'm ready to receive,\n\n383\n00:18:07.001 --> 00:18:08.121\nsend it to me.\n\n384\n00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:12.487\n&gt;&gt; And now I transfer all of my documents,\nall of my pictures, all of my other data,\n\n385\n00:18:12.487 --> 00:18:17.080\nall transferred over to this\nattacker's machine, that would be bad.\n\n386\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.638\nSo when the two machines\ndiscover each other,\n\n387\n00:18:19.638 --> 00:18:21.812\nthey're gonna display a code number.\n\n388\n00:18:21.812 --> 00:18:25.320\nA code number that I've got to verify on\nboth machines to make sure it matches.\n\n389\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.499\nAnd that way I know it's my machines,\nand not an attacker,\n\n390\n00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:30.414\nthat's a really important thing.\n\n391\n00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:33.780\nAll right, the migration assistant is\ndone, .NET Framework is installed.\n\n392\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.088\nAnd so on my Windows machine,\nI can run the migration assistant now,\n\n393\n00:18:37.088 --> 00:18:39.263\nit dropped an icon on my desktop for\nme there.\n\n394\n00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:41.080\nSo I'm gonna run that.\n\n395\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.890\nAnd when it runs, now we're actually\nin the migration assistant.\n\n396\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.346\nI'll just hit continue.\n\n397\n00:18:46.346 --> 00:18:50.768\nAnd it's telling me that Windows updates\nare currently configured to install\n\n398\n00:18:50.768 --> 00:18:54.319\nautomatically to avoid interrupting\nthe migration process,\n\n399\n00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:57.060\nI should disable automatic updates.\n\n400\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.878\nSometimes a Windows automatic update\nwill cause the machine to reboot.\n\n401\n00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:02.580\n&gt;&gt; Then if a reboots halfway through\na migration, that's not so good.\n\n402\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.832\nSo it's suggesting that I turn that off.\n\n403\n00:19:04.832 --> 00:19:08.110\nMy machine is currently,\ncompletely up-to-date.\n\n404\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.746\nSo I'm just gonna continue and\nmove past on that one, right?\n\n405\n00:19:10.746 --> 00:19:14.350\nNow see how it says waiting for\na Mac to connect?\n\n406\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.611\nIt's advertising on the network.\n\n407\n00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:19.355\nIt's shouting out on the network using\nthe Bonjour protocol saying hey, I'm here,\n\n408\n00:19:19.355 --> 00:19:21.550\nI'm looking for\na new computer to send my data to.\n\n409\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.492\nBack on my Mac, it's already found it.\n\n410\n00:19:25.492 --> 00:19:30.895\nRight here it just found DESKTOP-CAVNQI8,\napparently is the name of my computer.\n\n411\n00:19:30.895 --> 00:19:32.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it found it.\n\n412\n00:19:32.594 --> 00:19:36.551\nThe migration system is\na packed full of little jokes,\n\n413\n00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:41.550\nlike the Windows logo earlier was\na really old style sliding window.\n\n414\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.006\n&gt;&gt; There's an olden style\nmonitor right there.\n\n415\n00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:43.994\n&gt;&gt; Old style CRT.\n\n416\n00:19:43.994 --> 00:19:45.810\nAnd that screen is\nthe blue screen of death.\n\n417\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's displayed when a Windows\n\n418\n00:19:47.215 --> 00:19:47.980\nmachine crashes.\n\n419\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.746\nSo a lot of little jokes\ntucked away on this one.\n\n420\n00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny.\n\n421\n00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.090\n&gt;&gt; But it found it.\n\n422\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.262\nAnd it might have found ten machines,\nthey would all be displayed here,\n\n423\n00:19:55.262 --> 00:19:56.305\neach as an icon, okay?\n\n424\n00:19:56.305 --> 00:20:00.672\nIf this is the machine I want, I click on\nit so that it knows that's the one I want,\n\n425\n00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:02.840\nand then I can hit continue.\n\n426\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.365\nAnd when I do it, here's the code, okay?\n\n427\n00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:08.616\n&gt;&gt; My code is 769117.\n\n428\n00:20:08.616 --> 00:20:11.560\nIf I go back and move forward,\nI get an all new code.\n\n429\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.210\nSo it's a new code every time, 769117.\n\n430\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.920\nI'll jump over to my Windows machine,\ndo I see the same number?\n\n431\n00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.774\n&gt;&gt; You, do.\n&gt;&gt; If I don't see the same number,\n\n432\n00:20:21.774 --> 00:20:24.020\nI need to cancel, right?\n\n433\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.483\nBecause when I hit continue,\n\n434\n00:20:25.483 --> 00:20:28.301\nI'm gonna start sending my\ndata to this other computer.\n\n435\n00:20:28.301 --> 00:20:31.330\nAnd if the codes don't match,\nI'm sending to an attacker.\n\n436\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.625\nI'm sending to somebody else's computer,\njust the wrong machine.\n\n437\n00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:36.010\nMaybe it's not an attacker, but\nI'm sending it to the wrong place.\n\n438\n00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.069\nSo I need to make sure that code matches,\nin my case, they do.\n\n439\n00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:40.770\nSo I'll go ahead and hit continue.\n\n440\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.144\nAnd now it's telling me we're not actually\ntransferring yet, you need to go and\n\n441\n00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:47.110\nfinish on the new computer.\n\n442\n00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.878\nI've done everything I need\nto here on the old computer.\n\n443\n00:20:49.878 --> 00:20:52.238\nWhen I go over the new computer,\nnow it's asking me,\n\n444\n00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:54.150\nwhat do I wanna bring over, right?\n\n445\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.338\nIt found my Don Pezet user account.\n\n446\n00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.570\nSo hey great, you gotta user account,\nwonderful, let's bring it over, right?\n\n447\n00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.019\nYou might have more than one user.\n\n448\n00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:03.702\nAnd so it would display each user right\nhere in the list, and you can pick\n\n449\n00:21:03.702 --> 00:21:06.600\nthe ones that you wanted to bring over,\nor the ones that you wanted to leave.\n\n450\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.738\nI wanna bring over, Don Pezet, all right?\n\n451\n00:21:08.738 --> 00:21:12.789\nInside of my user account, it's gonna\nbring over music, pictures, movies,\n\n452\n00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:16.430\ndesktop, all these different little items,\nsome of which are empty.\n\n453\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.620\nI don't have any music,\nmy pictures are pretty small, so\n\n454\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.301\nthis is gonna be a pretty\nquick migration for me.\n\n455\n00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:26.270\nIf you've been using this computer for\nyears though, you might have tons of data.\n\n456\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.123\nYou might have a terabyte of data,\nit might take forever to transfer it over,\n\n457\n00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.455\nit's trying to give you\nthat idea right here.\n\n458\n00:21:32.455 --> 00:21:36.480\nAnd then after that, I'm seeing all the\ndifferent settings it's gonna bring over.\n\n459\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.871\nAnd then after that,\nI see other files that it's going to grab.\n\n460\n00:21:39.871 --> 00:21:43.550\nAnd it's looking at the hard drive and\nsaying, what else do I wanna bring over?\n\n461\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.589\nSome of this I may want, some I may not.\n\n462\n00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:49.451\nI've got this Windows.old folders\nleft over from an upgrade,\n\n463\n00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:53.640\nit's 6.44 gigs in size, and\nit's an old copy of Windows.\n\n464\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.544\nI don't wanna bring that over.\n\n465\n00:21:54.544 --> 00:21:55.443\n&gt;&gt; Uh-uh.\n\n466\n00:21:55.443 --> 00:21:58.410\n&gt;&gt; Windows 10 upgrade, I don't want that.\n\n467\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.226\nIn fact, most of these folders,\nlooking down the list here,\n\n468\n00:22:01.226 --> 00:22:02.807\nI don't really need any of these.\n\n469\n00:22:02.807 --> 00:22:06.850\nSo I'm just gonna turn that\nwhole option off, like that.\n\n470\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.979\nI just need the stuff that's\na part of my user profile.\n\n471\n00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:11.946\nBut you can go through and pick, and\nfind the things that you want, and\n\n472\n00:22:11.946 --> 00:22:15.490\nit gives you a little summary down here of\nhow much you're actually bringing over.\n\n473\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.791\nI'm bringing over a whopping\n91 kilobytes of data\n\n474\n00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:18.311\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n475\n00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:20.603\n&gt;&gt; But it was a lot larger when I had that\n\n476\n00:22:20.603 --> 00:22:24.890\nWindows drive selected,\ncuz I added another, what was it, six?\n\n477\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.948\n&gt;&gt; Enough to fill a small\ncloset of a small child\n\n478\n00:22:26.948 --> 00:22:27.594\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n479\n00:22:27.594 --> 00:22:28.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:22:28.143 --> 00:22:31.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm just gonna\npick all the stuff that I want.\n\n481\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.703\nNotice that it's not exactly perfect,\nit doesn't give me the ability to browse\n\n482\n00:22:34.703 --> 00:22:37.118\nthe hard drive and\nfind a whole lot of detailed information.\n\n483\n00:22:37.118 --> 00:22:39.190\nSo these are kind of broad strokes.\n\n484\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.597\nIf there's anything more detailed I need\nto get, I might have to do that manually.\n\n485\n00:22:42.597 --> 00:22:47.301\nBut once I've picked everything that I\nneed, I can go ahead and move forward, and\n\n486\n00:22:47.301 --> 00:22:49.990\nit's going to start the migration.\n\n487\n00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.498\nSo now it's talking to the old machine.\n\n488\n00:22:51.498 --> 00:22:54.419\nIf I look at the old machine,\nit shows less than a minute remaining,\n\n489\n00:22:54.419 --> 00:22:57.950\nit's transferring Don Pezet's information,\nright now.\n\n490\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.468\nAnd back over here, it's receiving,\n\n491\n00:22:59.468 --> 00:23:01.592\nthat information it's copying it over and\nmoving it.\n\n492\n00:23:01.592 --> 00:23:04.515\nNow the more data you have,\nthe longer this will take.\n\n493\n00:23:04.515 --> 00:23:06.656\nI've seen this take six hours before.\n\n494\n00:23:06.656 --> 00:23:07.233\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n495\n00:23:07.233 --> 00:23:08.769\n&gt;&gt; It also depends on your network speed,\n\n496\n00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:11.475\nif you're on a wireless network\nversus wired, that all impacts it.\n\n497\n00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:15.205\nBut if you do a small set of data,\nit's gonna move over pretty darn quick.\n\n498\n00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:15.828\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n499\n00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:20.150\n&gt;&gt; And once it's done,\nthe migration is now complete.\n\n500\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:25.940\nWhen I quit out of the migration wizard,\nit's gonna return me back to my new Mac.\n\n501\n00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.805\nAnd earlier I just had\na Christopher Walken account,\n\n502\n00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:31.065\nthat fake account that I've been using.\n\n503\n00:23:31.065 --> 00:23:32.714\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But now right next next to it,\n\n504\n00:23:32.714 --> 00:23:34.973\nthere's a Don Pezet account, all right?\n\n505\n00:23:34.973 --> 00:23:37.348\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It brought that over from the Windows\n\n506\n00:23:37.348 --> 00:23:40.505\nmachine, and\nnow it's over here, all right?\n\n507\n00:23:40.505 --> 00:23:43.073\nBut my migration isn't over yet,\nthere's still just a little more.\n\n508\n00:23:43.073 --> 00:23:46.039\nIf I click on my user\naccount to get logged in,\n\n509\n00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:49.639\nit's gonna tell me to reset the password,\nall right?\n\n510\n00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:53.228\nApple can't decrypt\nthe password that Windows has.\n\n511\n00:23:53.228 --> 00:23:56.561\nSo when it brings the user over,\nit has no password.\n\n512\n00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.827\nSo if I had just stopped right here and\nwalked away,\n\n513\n00:23:58.827 --> 00:24:01.620\nanybody could walk into my computer,\nclick on my account, and\n\n514\n00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.700\nthen they would get to pick my password,\nwhich would be bad.\n\n515\n00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:10.030\nSo I need to come in and put in what\nI want my password to be, oops.\n\n516\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.584\nI'm going to try to put in\nwhat I want my password to be.\n\n517\n00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:21.780\nAnd once that's done,\nI can reset my password.\n\n518\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.100\nAnd now I've actually got a password on my\naccount that's gonna log in as me, right?\n\n519\n00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.360\nNow, it brought over a lot of stuff,\n\n520\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.370\nbut there's some things\nthat it doesn't bring over.\n\n521\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.740\nSo I think the desktop wallpaper is one.\n\n522\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.040\nSo you'll notice that I had that crazy\nWindows wallpaper on the other side.\n\n523\n00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.650\nI'm not gonna have my fancy\nWindows wallpaper here.\n\n524\n00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.880\nBut my bookmarks, my pictures,\nthose things all should have come over.\n\n525\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.510\nIt's asking if I want to\nsign in with an Apple ID.\n\n526\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.710\nI'm a new Mac user, right?\n\n527\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.650\nSo, I must obviously want a Mac ID.\n\n528\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.670\nI'm going to choose not to sign in for\nnow, but I could if I needed one.\n\n529\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.580\nAnd then, just a couple of little odds and\nends here as\n\n530\n00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.640\nyou this would be the same as if we\ncreated any kind of new user in a Mac.\n\n531\n00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.250\nThe difference would be one side get in,\n\n532\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.115\nI'll actually have some existing\nExisting account data, okay?\n\n533\n00:25:07.115 --> 00:25:08.435\nSo I just got logged in.\n\n534\n00:25:08.435 --> 00:25:11.215\nIt did not bring my Windows\nwallpaper over, right.\n\n535\n00:25:11.215 --> 00:25:14.445\nAnd there's actually a reason for\nthis, I learned this not too long ago.\n\n536\n00:25:15.465 --> 00:25:18.165\nThe Windows wallpapers\nare all copyrighted.\n\n537\n00:25:18.165 --> 00:25:19.975\nAnd they're copyrighted for Windows.\n\n538\n00:25:19.975 --> 00:25:22.770\nAnd so if Apple were to bring those over\nthat would be violating the copyright.\n\n539\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.285\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, infringement.\n\n540\n00:25:23.285 --> 00:25:23.805\nYeah.\n\n541\n00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:26.315\n&gt;&gt; And they don't have a good way to check\nto see whether you're using an official\n\n542\n00:25:26.315 --> 00:25:27.865\nwallpaper or\none that you've gotten yourself, so\n\n543\n00:25:27.865 --> 00:25:28.825\nthey just don't bring it over.\n\n544\n00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:30.120\nSo that gets left out.\n\n545\n00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.730\nBut if I got into My Documents,\nthere's my resume, right?\n\n546\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:41.080\nI can fire that up and I've got Don Pezet,\nEdutainer-at-large, right there.\n\n547\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.490\nIf I go into my pictures, which is not\nin my side bar for whatever reason.\n\n548\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.460\nGo up here to my go Menu.\n\n549\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.060\nAnd I will go to,\nwhere do my pictures end up?\n\n550\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.750\nThis is the hardest part,\nis figuring where everything ends up.\n\n551\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.288\nBut if I go to my home folder,\nand into pictures, there we go.\n\n552\n00:26:01.288 --> 00:26:04.410\nThere's my picture, and\nZach, we both came over.\n\n553\n00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.455\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, but\nyou're infringing my copyright.\n\n554\n00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:07.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's possible.\n\n555\n00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:11.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then if I fire up Safari,\n\n556\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.550\nlet's see if my bookmarks came over.\n\n557\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.300\nAnd I'll take a look.\n\n558\n00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:19.130\nAnd over here in my Bookmarks,\nI've got bookmarks migrated from\n\n559\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.500\nInternet Explorer and\nbookmarks migrated from Microsoft Edge.\n\n560\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.430\nI created mine in Internet Explorer,\nand so there we go, CNN,\n\n561\n00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.920\nFOXNews, ITProTV, all brought over, right?\n\n562\n00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.060\nSo the process of migrating from\na old machine, be it a Mac or\n\n563\n00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.900\na Windows machine, over to a new machine,\nis fairly painless like this, right?\n\n564\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.050\nIt happened a lot faster here cuz\nI had such a small set of data.\n\n565\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:46.880\nBut even if I had a larger set, it just\ncopies it over and it's done, all right?\n\n566\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.460\nSo most of my information is here.\n\n567\n00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.110\nThings that I might be missing,\n\n568\n00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.770\nlet's say I had Microsoft Office\ninstalled on my old machine.\n\n569\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.840\nIt didn't install Microsoft Office for me.\n\n570\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.170\nOr if I had Adobe Photoshop,\nit didn't install that.\n\n571\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.530\nSo it doesn't bring the applications over.\n\n572\n00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.460\nIt brings your documents over.\n\n573\n00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.820\nIt brings your bookmarks for\na web browser.\n\n574\n00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.040\nIt brings that stuff over.\n\n575\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.200\nIt doesn't bring applications over.\n\n576\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.035\nSo I still need to install\napplications and some other things.\n\n577\n00:27:11.035 --> 00:27:15.460\nIt's not totally painless, but it does\ntake care of making sure our data gets\n\n578\n00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.290\nmoved over, and\nnow we are ready to use or new Mac.\n\n579\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful information as usual, Don.\n\n580\n00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.310\nThank you very much, moving content\nexcellent episode before we move on.\n\n581\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.030\nYou need to say something else, don't you?\n\n582\n00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.180\n&gt;&gt; Just the little caveat about how\nwe can run this two different ways.\n\n583\n00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.500\nSo I ran the Migration Assistant\nafter the fact,\n\n584\n00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.910\nit's far easier to run it\nduring the initial install.\n\n585\n00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.340\nWhen you power on a new Mac, or\n\n586\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.000\nwhen you've just installed MacOS,\nit asked if you want to migrate data over?\n\n587\n00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.520\nYou don't have to worry about\nduplicate user accounts,\n\n588\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.430\nthat's a pretty cool way to do it.\n\n589\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.310\nI did it over the network, right?\n\n590\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.580\nSo we were using a wireless network\nhere in between my machines, or\n\n591\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.960\nactually these are two virtual machines\nhere, so it's just internal to my laptop.\n\n592\n00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.660\nBut if you're doing this in real life,\n\n593\n00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.850\nit will be a heck of a lot\nfaster if you use Thunderbolt.\n\n594\n00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.540\nThe problem is Thunderbolt\ncables are expensive, and\n\n595\n00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.910\nif you've got an old Mac and a new Mac,\nthe new Mac probably has USB-C ports.\n\n596\n00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.030\nThe old Mac probably has\nthe display port style Thunderbolt,\n\n597\n00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.770\nThunderbolt 2 versus Thunderbolt 3.\n\n598\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.800\nIt's getting increasingly difficult\nto get cabling like that,\n\n599\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.250\nthat will work in between two machines.\n\n600\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.790\nSo you're better off doing a crossover\nnetwork cable or creating an ad\n\n601\n00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.520\nhoc wireless network between your systems,\nsomething of that nature.\n\n602\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.810\nBut it is gonna slow things down.\n\n603\n00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.710\nIt just takes awhile and\ncopy a lot of data.\n\n604\n00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.520\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, thanks, Don, great stuff.\n\n605\n00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.160\nAnd by the way,\n\n606\n00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.230\nmake sure you see every single\nepisode of Apple Certified Associate.\n\n607\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.370\nYou're going to be very glad you did.\n\n608\n00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.860\nDon's done a wonderful job putting\ntogether this series for you.\n\n609\n00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.320\nEverything you need to move forward and\nmove beyond.\n\n610\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.281\nAnd by the way,\nyou're going to be in that course I bring,\n\n611\n00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:45.653\nthere's thousands of videos in there.\n\n612\n00:28:45.653 --> 00:28:49.800\nThey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further, check those out too.\n\n613\n00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.026\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV,\n\n614\n00:28:52.026 --> 00:28:53.806\nyou know ITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n615\n00:28:53.806 --> 00:28:55.068\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n616\n00:28:55.068 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:11.706\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:12.723\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:16.300\nwatching ITProTV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.980\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with Apple Certified Associate.\n\n7\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.870\nThis episode, hold onto your hats,\nTime Machine.\n\n8\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.900\nWe're gonna go back to 1960, no, I'm not.\n\n9\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.080\nTime Machine is the title of this episode,\nand\n\n10\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.600\nDon Pezet is here to\nhelp us out with that.\n\n11\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.225\nDon, good to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.661\n&gt;&gt; And I am glad to be here,\nI drove up in my DeLorean this morning.\n\n13\n00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:36.439\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n14\n00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.860\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe got the flux capacitor all fired up.\n\n15\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.155\nWe've, I don't know,\nviolated copyright three times now.\n\n16\n00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:42.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A few times.\n\n17\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.105\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna wish we had a time machine.\n\n18\n00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:47.540\n&gt;&gt; I just said 1960,\nI mean I'm in the clear.\n\n19\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.690\n&gt;&gt; So in this episode, we're gonna talk\nabout how important it is to backup\n\n20\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.100\nour data, so that if anything ever\ngoes wrong we can restore and\n\n21\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.720\nget back to, well back to right.\n\n22\n00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.720\nSo, that's where we're gonna be taking a\nlook at and Apple has an amazing product,\n\n23\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.160\nbuilt in the Mac OS called,\nTime Machine that let's us do that.\n\n24\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.345\nSo, we'll see how to implement it.\n\n25\n00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:06.367\nHow it does it's job.\n\n26\n00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:12.730\nWhat it does and how it gives us a super\nmega easy way to backup our data.\n\n27\n00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.250\nSo, the next time you hear somebody say,\nthey lost their information and\n\n28\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.090\ncouldn't store it, you can say well\nwhy didn't you use Time Machine?\n\n29\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.380\nIt was so easy,\nit's right there built in for you.\n\n30\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.440\nSo that's what we're gonna see,\nright here, in this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.730\n&gt;&gt; So Don, first of all,\nhow does Time Machine work?\n\n32\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.950\n&gt;&gt; All right so\nit works on pretty neat system.\n\n33\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.338\nSo the idea with Time Machine\nis that you have a Mac and\n\n34\n00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:32.650\ncuz it's Apple software, right?\n\n35\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.324\nSo it's gonna be a Mac,\nmaybe it's an iMac, a Mac Pro,\n\n36\n00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:41.540\nMac Mini, Macbook, Airbook,\nwhatever or Macbook Air, names, right?\n\n37\n00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.220\nAnd you want to back it up.\n\n38\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.370\nAll right, you need to keep\nan extra copy of the data.\n\n39\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.240\nWell most Macs only have one hard\ndrive and don't have room for more.\n\n40\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.510\nSo like my Macbook for example or\nZach's Macbook Air, there's only room for\n\n41\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.640\none hard drive in there.\n\n42\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.066\nIt's not like you can add\na second hard drive to backup.\n\n43\n00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.202\nYou could partition your hard drive,\nand backup to the same disk, but\n\n44\n00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:02.713\nif your drive fails,\nthen you lose your backup, also.\n\n45\n00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:04.187\nSo that doesn't make any sense.\n\n46\n00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:07.710\n&gt;&gt; You need to backup to some\nkind of external system.\n\n47\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.760\nAnd that's where things got really tricky,\nfor years,\n\n48\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.850\nand years, having that external system\nwas kind of a hard thing to do.\n\n49\n00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.385\nAnd some of the backup technologies\nlike backing up to tape that\n\n50\n00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:20.192\nwasj ust a nightmare but\npeople still do it today.\n\n51\n00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:20.854\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n52\n00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.484\n&gt;&gt; But fortunately for\nus we don't need that,\n\n53\n00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:27.263\nwith Time Machine all you need\nis something like this, right?\n\n54\n00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:31.062\nSo this is a little USB hard drive, or\nthey make thunderbolt hard drives as well\n\n55\n00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:33.550\nthey're just more expensive and\nI'm a tightwad.\n\n56\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.506\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so this is a USB 3.0 hard drive,\n\n57\n00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:42.154\nthey cost less than 100 bucks.\n\n58\n00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:46.698\nYou can get one terabyte ones for\nprobably $60 US, very very inexpensive.\n\n59\n00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:51.480\nAnd you can plug it in your Mac and\nit'll show up as an extra hard drive.\n\n60\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.110\nAnd the system can then set up automated\nbackups to backup your data to the disks.\n\n61\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.660\nThat's what Time Machine is doing.\n\n62\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.854\nTime Machine is saying, here's this hard\ndrive, we're gonna use the store backups\n\n63\n00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:06.590\non and then it is routinely\nreaching out and doing backups.\n\n64\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.400\nIt actually doing a backup once an hour.\n\n65\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.120\nOnce an hour, it's backing up\nyour data to this external disk.\n\n66\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.600\nSo when you have a failure,\nworst case scenario,\n\n67\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.580\nyou might lose 59 minutes of your work.\n\n68\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.310\nBecause a backup definitely happened\nwithin the last 60 minutes, right?\n\n69\n00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.350\nSo that's a great way to jump in there,\nand you don't even have to think about it,\n\n70\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.250\nonce you turn it on, it just runs.\n\n71\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.320\nYou just have to remember to plug the disk\nin, and then your backup occurs, and\n\n72\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.380\nyou're in business.\n\n73\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.600\nBut it's backing up once an hour.\n\n74\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.825\nAnd then it's saving historical\nbackups as many as it can,\n\n75\n00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.470\nuntil the hard drive fills up.\n\n76\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.600\nSo you might be able to say, man,\n\n77\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.170\nI I deleted a file four days ago,\nI wonder if I can get it back?\n\n78\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.240\nOr, here's this document I'm working on\nand I removed one paragraph out of it\n\n79\n00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.860\na week ago,\nI wish I could have that paragraph back.\n\n80\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.680\nAnd you can pull up the version\nfrom a week ago, and copy and\n\n81\n00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.160\npaste that paragraph back\ninto your existing document.\n\n82\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.300\nYou can get that data because\nTime Machine took care of the backup,\n\n83\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.760\ndid it all automated.\n\n84\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.810\nAnd just ran that backup for you, and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n85\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.021\n&gt;&gt; What happens if our Time Machine\ndisk isn't connected though, Don?\n\n86\n00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:10.999\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as I said,\n\n87\n00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.435\nit all works great as long as you\nremember to plug in your disk.\n\n88\n00:04:13.435 --> 00:04:13.992\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:15.316\n&gt;&gt; Here I am, I'm showing you.\n\n90\n00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:18.308\nHey here's this hard drive,\nand full disclosure,\n\n91\n00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:21.237\nthis is my actual Time Machine\ndisk from my laptop.\n\n92\n00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:22.606\nSo this is the one I back up to.\n\n93\n00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:27.420\nI snagged it out of my office right when I\nleft, you might notice it's got a cable.\n\n94\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.457\nAnd thanks to our new USBC overlords,\nI have to have a little dongle on it.\n\n95\n00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:33.235\n&gt;&gt; Gotta have a dongle.\n\n96\n00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:34.593\n&gt;&gt; Mine's a USB 3 disk.\n\n97\n00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:38.278\nI guess I could replace this cable,\nwhatever, and again,\n\n98\n00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.918\nwe just need to plug it in.\n\n99\n00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:42.829\nMine's not plugged in,\nI'm holding it right here in my hands.\n\n100\n00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:47.332\nSo if an hour ticks by, which definitely\nhas since I've unplugged this,\n\n101\n00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:49.455\nthe backup did not occur, did it?\n\n102\n00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.684\nWell it's sort of occurs,\nit actually does make a backup.\n\n103\n00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:59.360\nIt backs up locally to your own system as\nopposed to backing up to a removable disk.\n\n104\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.540\nSo basically it's going to\ncreate a local backup for you.\n\n105\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.400\nAnd the next time you attach your\nphysical disk, then it'll update them and\n\n106\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.910\npump over to that physical disk.\n\n107\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.250\nBut if you go weeks and forget to plug\nit in, that machine doesn't work, and\n\n108\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.340\nyou lose your data.\n\n109\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.720\nSo it's really important\nto settle into a routine.\n\n110\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.130\nI actually have a little\ndocking station at my desk, and\n\n111\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.990\nthis drive stays plugged\ninto that docking station.\n\n112\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.310\nAnd so when I’m done with a show at\nthe end of the day, I take my laptop,\n\n113\n00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.320\nI go back to my office and\nI plug it into the dock.\n\n114\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.040\nAnd when I do that,\nit immediately sees that hard drive and\n\n115\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.890\nit starts to back up, right?\n\n116\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.440\nSo it’s all kind of an automated\nprocess if you remember to do it.\n\n117\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.878\nBut if you forget,\nthen it all starts to break down, okay?\n\n118\n00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:45.867\nNow a neat thing about this is you can\nactually configure Time Machine with more\n\n119\n00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.240\nthan one hard drive.\n\n120\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.005\nBecause you might wanna rotate out.\n\n121\n00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:52.490\nMaybe you have a hard drive at home you\nback up to, and a hard drive at work.\n\n122\n00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.650\nOr maybe you've got a MacOS\nserver running somewhere, and\n\n123\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.860\nyou wanna use it as a Time Machine target,\nall right?\n\n124\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.450\nNow that's another piece of\nfunctionality that Apple is\n\n125\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.920\nkilling off in the server app, so\nyou don't wanna rely on that too long.\n\n126\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.330\nBut they have what\nare called Time Capsules,\n\n127\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.070\nwhich are hardware backup\ndevices that Apple sells.\n\n128\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.770\nAnd when you bring your laptop onto\nthe same network as that time capsule,\n\n129\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.890\nit can immediately start backing up.\n\n130\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.370\nSo there's a number of options there.\n\n131\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.150\nAnd we see this when we\nset up Time Machine.\n\n132\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.590\nLet me show you that process real quick.\n\n133\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.990\nSo I've got a Mac here and\nthis is actually a virtual machine,\n\n134\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.470\nnot my laptop, but\nI've never backed this one up.\n\n135\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.460\nIt doesn't have Time Machine set up.\n\n136\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.880\nI have an extra hard\ndrive stuck in it though.\n\n137\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.920\nAnd if I fire up my disk utility,\nI'll see that extra hard drive,\n\n138\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.360\nhere's this terabyte\nhard drive sitting here.\n\n139\n00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.786\nWhen you plug a brand new hard drive in,\n\n140\n00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:44.290\nmacOS will recognize it and ask if\nyou wanna format it or initialize it.\n\n141\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.140\nAnd if you do, then it'll ask you, hey do\nyou wanna use it for Time Machine, right?\n\n142\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.300\nIt wants to automatically\nset up Time Machine for us.\n\n143\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.757\nSo I'm gonna do that here.\nI'm just gonna choose that disk,\n\n144\n00:06:53.757 --> 00:06:55.028\nI'm gonna erase it.\n\n145\n00:06:55.028 --> 00:06:59.480\nAnd I'm gonna call it Time Machine,\nso I can remember what it is.\n\n146\n00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:05.935\nFor the file system it has to\nbe either macOS Extended or\n\n147\n00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:08.280\nAPFS, so it's gotta be one or the other.\n\n148\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.470\nIf you choose FAT, or\nexFAT Time Machine won't work.\n\n149\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.530\nTime machine depends on the Apple\nfile systems function,.\n\n150\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.140\nIf your disk is an SSD,\nyou should do APFS.\n\n151\n00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.300\nIf it's a spinning disk,\n\n152\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.930\nlike mine is, you'll want to\ndo macOS extended journaled.\n\n153\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.666\nMy internal disk is an SSD,\nso I'm using APFS.\n\n154\n00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:30.350\nBut this backup drive, I'm a tightwad,\nI bought a cheap disk and\n\n155\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.530\nso it's spinning disk,\nI need to make sure I choose that.\n\n156\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.450\nSo I'm gonna choose MacOS Extended\nJournaled and I'll hit erase.\n\n157\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.460\nNow it's gonna erase that disk.\n\n158\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.750\nAnd I named it Time Machine, but\n\n159\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.350\nyou can name it anything,\ncould have called it Bob, right?\n\n160\n00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.950\nBut the moment MacOS sees that new disk,\n\n161\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.370\nit's gonna ask me what I wanna do with it,\nright?\n\n162\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.840\nAnd I say the moment that it sees it,\nit hasn't popped up for me.\n\n163\n00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.060\nAnd normally my pop up box, and it'll say,\nwhat do you want to use this disc for?\n\n164\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.620\nDo you want to use it for Time Machine?\n\n165\n00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.139\nAnd it'll give you that opportunity,\nright?\n\n166\n00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.308\nSo you'll normally see that pop up.\n\n167\n00:07:59.308 --> 00:08:02.164\nIf like me, for some reason you're\nnot seeing that pop up, actually,\n\n168\n00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:04.670\nlet me just make sure that\nit actually did mount.\n\n169\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.645\nAll right, it mounted,\nit just didn't prompt me, interesting.\n\n170\n00:08:08.645 --> 00:08:10.919\nSo let me, I can force it to mount.\n\n171\n00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:13.590\nYou shouldn't have to but I can force it.\n\n172\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.940\nSo if I come in and I unmount that disk,\n\n173\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.031\nso it's gonna basically unplug it,\nthere we go.\n\n174\n00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.170\nAnd then I can just mount it back again\nand the system will see that and connect.\n\n175\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.950\nAnd if it's the first time it sees it,\nIt'll prompt that message.\n\n176\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.480\nI'm just not gonna get that message.\n\n177\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.090\nAll right,\nwell let's do it the manual way then.\n\n178\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.460\nThe manual way is we just\ngo into system preferences.\n\n179\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.560\nAnd inside of system preferences,\nyou'll find preference and\n\n180\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.120\ntherefore time machine.\n\n181\n00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.950\nDown towards the bottom, it's a little\ngreen circle with a clock in it, right?\n\n182\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.425\nAnd notice the arrow\nthat's pointing backwards.\n\n183\n00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:44.030\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n184\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.650\n&gt;&gt; Rolling back the time.\n\n185\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.990\nWe can just go into Time Machine, and\n\n186\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.890\nonce we go there it's saying hey\nyou're not running Time Machine.\n\n187\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.170\nYou really should think about it all\nyou have to do is pick a backup disk.\n\n188\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.910\nNow if it detects me plug the disk\nin then it would've already\n\n189\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.340\nknown which disk I wanted\nin my case it doesn't.\n\n190\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.320\nI can select backup disk and it's gonna\nlet me pick from the available disks.\n\n191\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.070\nAnd there's my Time Machine disk\nright there, I can chose it, right?\n\n192\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.810\nNow, if I have more than one disk,\nI can actually chose more than one.\n\n193\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.030\nIt will back up to each of them and\nI can rotate them.\n\n194\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.940\nSo maybe I want one off-site,\nand one on-site.\n\n195\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.150\nI would just need to come through and just\nselect disk more than once, and add that.\n\n196\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.380\nIn my case I'm seeing my disk but\n\n197\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.780\nI'm also seeing two network\nstorage devices that we have.\n\n198\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.084\nThose are in our server room on\nthe other side of the building.\n\n199\n00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:32.028\nAnd I can backup to those as well.\n\n200\n00:09:32.028 --> 00:09:36.585\nIn fact, I can backup to my local disk and\nto this network disk at the same time.\n\n201\n00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:39.130\nSo you've got a lot of different\ndestinations you can pick from.\n\n202\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.890\nI'm just gonna choose that local one,\nright?\n\n203\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.410\nNow when I choose it I can hit use disk.\n\n204\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.680\nIt's gonna pick that one, and\nit's going to start to use it for backups.\n\n205\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.040\nOkay, now I turned off\nbackup automatically, and\n\n206\n00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.370\nI'll explain why in a moment.\n\n207\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.220\nBut for a brief moment you guys\nsaw that old timer kicked on.\n\n208\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.700\nIt was about to do the first backup, but\nnow that it's got a disk it's saying okay.\n\n209\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.920\nWe're gonna do an hourly backups for\nthe past 24 hours.\n\n210\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.340\nDaily backups for the past month.\n\n211\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.650\nAnd then weekly backups as far back as\nwe can go until the disk becomes full.\n\n212\n00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.360\nIt's ready to rock, and\nnow we've got Time Machine turned on.\n\n213\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Do I have to worry about other\npeople getting into my backups?\n\n214\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.900\nI mean, do I have to worry about that?\n\n215\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes.\n\n216\n00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.040\nSo I'm backing up to this disk.\n\n217\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.300\nThis disk that I was holding up\nin the air a moment ago, right?\n\n218\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.480\nSo I am backing up my\nproduction laptop to this disk.\n\n219\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.650\nWhat happens if somebody\ngets a hold of this?\n\n220\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.582\nIt's just a removable disk\nthat you walk in my office,\n\n221\n00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:34.844\nsnag it right off my desk and leave.\n\n222\n00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:38.069\nI wouldn't so.\n\n223\n00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:40.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So they would have the disk.\n\n224\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.880\nSo what could they do?\n\n225\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.310\nThey could go home, plug it into\ntheir computer, and what's on here?\n\n226\n00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.830\nEverything, all my data.\n\n227\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:46.680\nIt's all right here.\n\n228\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.500\nThey browse into it and get that, right?\n\n229\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.450\nSo we gotta be really\ncareful with the backups.\n\n230\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.830\nAnd the way we're careful\nis by encrypting them.\n\n231\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.620\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say.\n\n232\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.520\n&gt;&gt; You can encrypt your backups just\nlike FileVault does for your backups.\n\n233\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.910\nAnd that way if somebody steals\nthe disk and runs off with it and\n\n234\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.220\nplugs it into their own computer,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n235\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.460\nI don't care.\nIf somebody steals this,\n\n236\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.290\nwell, do care because this\ndisk cost me like $60, right?\n\n237\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's what I care about.\n\n238\n00:11:09.195 --> 00:11:10.720\n&gt;&gt; I figured you did.\n\n239\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.190\n&gt;&gt; But if somebody were to try and get\nat my data, I'm not worried about that.\n\n240\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.380\nThey would have to have my encryption\nkey to be able to unlock the disk and\n\n241\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.730\nget at it, or they'd have to have\nreally sophisticated computers.\n\n242\n00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.245\nStuff that's in SiFi movies\nto be able to break into it.\n\n243\n00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:25.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And honestly my data's is not special\n\n244\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.668\nat all, so they'd be wasting your time.\n\n245\n00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:29.853\nBut if you do have sensitive data, right?\n\n246\n00:11:29.853 --> 00:11:33.456\nMaybe your work for a nuclear\nresearch facility, or you work for\n\n247\n00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:36.780\nKFC and you know the original recipe for\nthat chicken.\n\n248\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.650\nWell then that's important data.\n\n249\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.950\nYou would wanna keep it safe.\n\n250\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.500\nSo I didn't do that, and so\nlet me come back in here.\n\n251\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.010\nAnd I'm gonna go to Select Disk this time.\n\n252\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.580\n&gt;&gt; And\nsee how Time Machine is now listed twice?\n\n253\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.205\nIt's listed as a backup disk, but\nit's also listed as an available disk.\n\n254\n00:11:51.205 --> 00:11:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n255\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.850\nthe reason it's listed twice is that I\nmight wanna add it back in again and\n\n256\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.640\nthis time choose Encrypt Backups,\nwhich I didn't choose last time.\n\n257\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.740\nAnd I can choose the disk as it is\nright now and choose to remove it.\n\n258\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.410\nThose would be unencrypted backups\nif I'd actually let a backup run.\n\n259\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.000\nAnd then I can hit Select Backup Disk,\nI can choose Time Machine, oops, darn it,\n\n260\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.190\nI went to fast.\n\n261\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.630\nNow I've gotta remove it again,\nbut anyhow I can add it again, and\n\n262\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:22.590\nthis time when I add it I can tell it that\nI want to encrypt the backups, right?\n\n263\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.890\nSo I'm gonna tell it that I want to\nencrypt the backup, hit Use Disk and\n\n264\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.130\nnow I have to pick my backup password.\n\n265\n00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.083\nWhat is the password that's\ngonna let me unlock this?\n\n266\n00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.771\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; AFC [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:12:34.771 --> 00:12:37.330\n&gt;&gt; Doing just a really\ngeneric one just because.\n\n268\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.490\nSo anyway I'll choose that and\nI'll choose to encrypt it.\n\n269\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.630\nAnd now it's gonna make sure\nthat that disk is encrypted and\n\n270\n00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.220\nwhen I backup my data it'll be nice and\nsafe.\n\n271\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.450\nI don't have to worry about\nsomebody getting at it.\n\n272\n00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.460\nBut once that's done it's now\nset up to be able to back up and\n\n273\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.440\ndo everything it needs to,\nI'm gonna turn this off.\n\n274\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.680\nSee how it's already encrypting the disk?\n\n275\n00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.870\nWell that encryption process that can\ntake a couple of hours to get done and\n\n276\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.620\nthen your backups are nice and safe, so\nyou need to let it run for the first time.\n\n277\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.811\nBut once it's done,\nthen it's all encrypted.\n\n278\n00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:07.529\nYour backups are safe and\nyou know you're in business.\n\n279\n00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:10.640\nAll built right into time machine.\n\n280\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.460\n&gt;&gt; So how do we restore data if needed?\n\n281\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.820\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nif I was more patient we could wait and\n\n282\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.810\nin about two hours it'll be don encrypting\nand the first backup would be done and\n\n283\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.450\nI'll have data that's on there.\n\n284\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.330\nWhen I'm impatient, so what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna ditch this virtual machine\n\n285\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.700\nand actually let me just\nturn this disk off.\n\n286\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.370\nThat way it's not eating\nup all my disk IO.\n\n287\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.500\nThere we go.\n\n288\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.030\nAnd let me just go to\nmy actually desk top.\n\n289\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.040\nSo here's my actual MacBook.\n\n290\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.905\nAnd I'm running Mac OS High Sierra.\n\n291\n00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:41.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I have time machine running.\n\n292\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.760\nI'm gonna plug this disk in.\n\n293\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.450\nLet me get that plug in here,\nand there we go.\n\n294\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.250\nSo I'm gonna see that appear on\nmy desktop here in a moment.\n\n295\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.130\nThis Time Machine disk will magically\nappear, assuming that it's working.\n\n296\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.380\nAnd once it does,\nnow Time Machine becomes happy again.\n\n297\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.385\nNow I've got a little Time Machine\nicon up here, at the top of my screen.\n\n298\n00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:04.046\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n299\n00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:09.180\n&gt;&gt; And if I click on that, it'll tell me,\nhey, my last backup ran at 8:34 AM.\n\n300\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.210\nThat must be when I unplugged my laptop\nto bring it here into the studio.\n\n301\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.662\nAnd then I can Back Up Now if I want,\nor I can enter into the Time Machine.\n\n302\n00:14:17.662 --> 00:14:20.980\nEntering in Time Machine\nsays show me the past.\n\n303\n00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.330\nShow me what was there, so\nI can get at it, all right?\n\n304\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.260\nAnd if I choose that,\n\n305\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.230\nentering the time machine, my screen\ndoes something a little weird, right?\n\n306\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.450\nWhat I'm looking at here\nis a finder window.\n\n307\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.040\nA finder window is like I'm\nbrowse my system and see files.\n\n308\n00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.420\nAnd right now it's\nshowing me what it looks\n\n309\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.950\nlike-\n&gt;&gt; Zero.\n\n310\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.680\n&gt;&gt; Today, right now.\n\n311\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.990\nBut if I use these up and down arrows,\nthat will start to change and\n\n312\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.760\nI can navigate back and\nstart to see previous times, right?\n\n313\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.390\nAnd that's some pretty neat stuff\nbecause what you can do is you can\n\n314\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.730\ngo back really pretty hard depending\non how much data is on your hard drive.\n\n315\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.100\nNow I've been backing this hard drive for\na couple of months.\n\n316\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.140\nSo I should be able to go back in good\nways unless I've made a lot of changes.\n\n317\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.510\nIf the drive fills up, it starts deleting\nolder backups to make room for newer ones.\n\n318\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.320\nSo I don't actually know\nhow far back I can go.\n\n319\n00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.200\nOn the right side of my screen,\nit's kind of hard to see,\n\n320\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.040\nbut you might notice\nall these little lines.\n\n321\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.900\nLet me show you this in a little more\ndetail because it's actually really,\n\n322\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.570\nreally cool.\n\n323\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.343\nI'm gonna zoom in a good bit here.\n\n324\n00:15:24.343 --> 00:15:27.566\nAll these little tick marks on the side of\nthe screen, as I move my mouse over them,\n\n325\n00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:28.332\nthey kind of grow.\n\n326\n00:15:28.332 --> 00:15:29.188\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n327\n00:15:29.188 --> 00:15:34.450\n&gt;&gt; And what you're seeing are times,\ntimes that these backups occurred.\n\n328\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.550\nAnd look at the times that I scroll\nacross, I've got now, today at 10:59,\n\n329\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.630\n10:54, 10:50 like it's scrolling back and\n\n330\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.580\nnot once in hour, these are like\nonce a a minute in some cases.\n\n331\n00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.570\nAnd then we'll start to see some gaps,\nright?\n\n332\n00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.579\nAs I continue to scroll back,\neventually we'll see gaps, there we go.\n\n333\n00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:57.866\nSo like when I get to the middle of\nthe night where here it is once an hour,\n\n334\n00:15:57.866 --> 00:16:02.160\n4:21 PM, 5:19 PM, 6:21 PM,\nthis is yesterday, right?\n\n335\n00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.536\nEvery hour these are the hourly\nbackups that it's doing.\n\n336\n00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:09.515\nSo if I know I deleted that\nfile at 3 o'clock yesterda,\n\n337\n00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:14.520\nwell if I go back to yesterday at 2:24,\nthe file will be there.\n\n338\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.740\nIf I go to 3:29, it won't be there.\n\n339\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.877\nI can jump back to where I want.\n\n340\n00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:24.950\nAnd as I keep going back further,\nthat was it for April, now I see March.\n\n341\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:29.534\nAnd looking at March, here I've got\nsome daily backups, 25th, 26th,\n\n342\n00:16:29.534 --> 00:16:34.399\n27th, 28th but as I start to go back\na little back further it's going to switch\n\n343\n00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.400\ninto weeklies.\n\n344\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.800\nSee here's March 22nd, and\nthen it goes back to March 15th, right?\n\n345\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.016\nAnd so it's got that gap where it's\nback to weeklies and then it ended.\n\n346\n00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:46.300\nI must have filled up the hard drive.\n\n347\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.740\nOnce the drive is full it's\ngotta delete older things.\n\n348\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:54.410\nI've been using that drive since, really,\nbefore the holidays, so well before March.\n\n349\n00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.640\nBut that's a far back as my backups go,\n\n350\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.590\ncuz the disk is apparently\nfull of changes.\n\n351\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.740\nI work with a lot of virtual\nmachine files that are large and so\n\n352\n00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.660\nit fills up pretty quick.\n\n353\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.600\nBut this lets me navigate easily to\nthat time and get to where I want to.\n\n354\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.430\nIf I'm reliant on these little arrows,\n\n355\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.050\nthe arrows become a bit of a challenge\ncuz you'd have to click back.\n\n356\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.185\nLike if I wanna get all the way\nback to March, I'm gonna be-\n\n357\n00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:16.990\n&gt;&gt; A lot of clicking\n\n358\n00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, clicking for a while, right?\n\n359\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.740\nSo that's how I browse to find\nthese backups, and it's kinda fun.\n\n360\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.240\nBecause if I take a folder like\nmy Virtual Machines folder,\n\n361\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.940\nright, I've got four virtual machines\nright now, a couple of Mac OS clients and\n\n362\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.160\na Windows machine, and\nthey're all just sitting right here.\n\n363\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.640\nBut I've had many, many others.\n\n364\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.856\nIf I scroll back today, I'm just\ngonna see these guys in here, right?\n\n365\n00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:40.526\nWhoops, right, there we go.\n\n366\n00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.670\nI'm just gonna see these guys in here.\n\n367\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.500\nAnd I kinda keep browsing back and\nthat's what I see.\n\n368\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.942\nBut if I go back a few days,\njust let me go back to,\n\n369\n00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:57.450\nLet's go way back like April 8th.\n\n370\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.260\nIf I go back to April\n8th it's scrolling back.\n\n371\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.405\nAnd now I see different machines, right?\n\n372\n00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:06.430\nWhatever I was teaching I needed\na bunch of legacy machines,\n\n373\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.620\nso here's some OS X 10.6, 10.7,\n10.8 that I was using for some other show.\n\n374\n00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.146\nWell they're still here.\n\n375\n00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:13.810\nThey're part of my backups.\n\n376\n00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.800\nI've deleted them from my hard drive but\nI can recover them if I want.\n\n377\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.640\nI can choose any one of these files, and\n\n378\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.680\nmaybe I really want that\nMountain Lion machine, right?\n\n379\n00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.500\nSo I'm gonna choose that Mountain Lion\nmachine and when I click on it,\n\n380\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.482\nI can restore it.\n\n381\n00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:32.720\nAnd that's gonna put it right back to\nwhere it was on my current hard drive.\n\n382\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.690\nOr I could just copy it and\npaste it somewhere.\n\n383\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.453\nI could edit it, whatever,\nkinda work with it as an individual file.\n\n384\n00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:43.110\nBecause I might not want to get\nrid of the current version of it.\n\n385\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.810\nI might wanna have this one in addition.\n\n386\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.600\nSo you've got that functionality to be\nable to quickly work with the data,\n\n387\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.820\nrecover it, and they make it super,\nsuper duper easy.\n\n388\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.885\n&gt;&gt; Can we access the backup data directly?\n\n389\n00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.720\n&gt;&gt; You can, yeah.\n\n390\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.480\nThe way I'm accessing it here,\n\n391\n00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.940\nthis is being done through\nthe time machine utility, right?\n\n392\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.400\nWhich we get at through, well,\nthe way I did there, through the menu,\n\n393\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.490\nto be able to gain access to our disks and\nsee what's going on.\n\n394\n00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.290\nBut you can get at this manually.\n\n395\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.860\nMy drive, it is showing up now.\n\n396\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.356\nHere's my time machine\ndisk that I plugged in.\n\n397\n00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:17.570\n&gt;&gt; Hey, there it goes.\n\n398\n00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.035\n&gt;&gt; If you browse to your Time Machine\ndisk what you'll find is a folder called\n\n399\n00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:23.020\nBackups.backupdb.\n\n400\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.720\nOne Time Machine disk might have backups\nfor more than one computer on it, so\n\n401\n00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.840\nwhen you expand that folder\nyou'll see your computer's name.\n\n402\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.670\nSo there's Don's MacBook Pro.\n\n403\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:35.510\nIf I was backing up Zach's computer it\nmight also say Zach's MacBook Ai,r right,\n\n404\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.820\nas it has each of these\ndifferent computers.\n\n405\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.490\nBut when you browse inside of that\nfolder you see dates and times.\n\n406\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.750\nThese are all the different backups, okay?\n\n407\n00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.420\nNow when it runs an hourly backup,\n\n408\n00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.410\ntechnically it's only backing up\nwhat changed in the last hour, so\n\n409\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.760\nthat folder might not have a whole\na lot of information in it.\n\n410\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.780\nIf I find my most current\nbackup right down here,\n\n411\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.270\nactually I can see there's\na back up in progress.\n\n412\n00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.790\nBut I can see that most current back up,\nthat folder itself might be pretty small.\n\n413\n00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.310\nBut I wouldn't know it because if I browse\ninside of there I see my hard drive.\n\n414\n00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.840\nI browse in there, and\n\n415\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.860\nnow I can start to see my entire disk\nas if I was browsing through normally.\n\n416\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.070\nAnd every file is going to be in here,\nfiles that have changed and\n\n417\n00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.260\nfiles that haven't changed.\n\n418\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.730\nWhen I browse in here's\nthese virtual machines and\n\n419\n00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.450\nsome of them have not changed\nsince the previous hour.\n\n420\n00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.730\nBut when I look here they are, and\nthey're several gigs in size, right?\n\n421\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.770\nNormally I would see they're\nseveral gigs in size.\n\n422\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.645\nBut when I look over here,\nI see dashes for their size.\n\n423\n00:20:38.645 --> 00:20:41.490\nAnd that's because these didn't change.\n\n424\n00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:46.630\nInstead, these are just links,\nlinks to the unchanged files.\n\n425\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.370\nIf it was a file that actually had changed\nit would have the previous version of that\n\n426\n00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.110\nfile sitting right there.\n\n427\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.120\nBut otherwise they're just links.\n\n428\n00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.010\nAnd so we don't really see that here,\nnavigating via the Finder.\n\n429\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.010\nAnother things is I mentioned I'm\nbacking up to two different places.\n\n430\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.870\nThere's the disk that I'm backing up to,\nbut\n\n431\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.000\nif the disk isn't connected\nit'll make a local backup.\n\n432\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.990\nAnd we can browse and see that too.\n\n433\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.852\nThat one, if we use our Go menu up top and\nbrowse to our Computer,\n\n434\n00:21:13.852 --> 00:21:16.284\nthen browse into Macintosh HD,\n\n435\n00:21:16.284 --> 00:21:20.538\ninside of Mackintosh HD\nyou'll have a volumes folder.\n\n436\n00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:23.682\nAnd shoot, that's right,\nit doesn't show up in the GUI.\n\n437\n00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:28.559\nWe'd have to use Go and Go to Folder,\nand browse to /volumes,\n\n438\n00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:31.238\nthat's where I want to browse to.\n\n439\n00:21:31.238 --> 00:21:37.430\nAnd when I browse to /volumes, here's\nthe Time Machine disk that I plugged in.\n\n440\n00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.133\nHere's my Macintosh HD.\n\n441\n00:21:38.133 --> 00:21:44.050\nAnd here's\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots.\n\n442\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.870\nThat's the folder it backs up to when your\nTime Machine hard drive isn't attached or\n\n443\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.110\nit can't find it.\n\n444\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.155\nIt's a local backup, so it'll save\nyou if you delete a file by accident.\n\n445\n00:21:52.155 --> 00:21:55.490\nBut if your hard drive fails,\nthis will go along with the hard drive.\n\n446\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.670\nSo it doesn't save you\nfrom a hardware failure.\n\n447\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.332\nBut you can browse in here,\n\n448\n00:21:59.332 --> 00:22:03.176\nand you'll see a similar backup\nstructure with backups in it.\n\n449\n00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:06.757\nAnd here is all these minute-by-minute\nbackups that we were seeing a moment ago.\n\n450\n00:22:06.757 --> 00:22:10.071\nThose are stored here in my local cache\nbecause they haven't been backed up\n\n451\n00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:11.590\nto the physical disk yet.\n\n452\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.840\nThey're all just being stored right here.\n\n453\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.780\nNow in High Sierra, and\nactually in Mac OS Sierra as well,\n\n454\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.330\nthis folder is called\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots.\n\n455\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.283\nIn previous versions of Mac OS\nit had a different name, so\n\n456\n00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:28.308\nthat folder name is something\nthat's recently changed.\n\n457\n00:22:28.308 --> 00:22:32.750\nBut it exists here, one way or another.\n\n458\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.890\nThis is that localsnapshots folder.\n\n459\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.810\nSo you can browse and look at these.\n\n460\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.900\nJust be careful.\n\n461\n00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.020\nIf you're using the GUI, it's fine.\n\n462\n00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.860\nIf you're using the Terminal things\ncan get a little bit weird, and\n\n463\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.880\nlet me show you what I mean there.\n\n464\n00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.780\nIf I browse into the Terminal and\nI go into my Volumes folder,\n\n465\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:57.300\nand I go into my Time Machine disk,\nand I start poking around in here,\n\n466\n00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.060\nlet me find a backup that I can look at.\n\n467\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.345\nSo I'll pick one of my older backups.\n\n468\n00:23:05.345 --> 00:23:07.810\nWe'll go all the way back to March 23rd.\n\n469\n00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.752\nAnd I'm gonna browse into my hard drive,\ninto my user account,\n\n470\n00:23:12.752 --> 00:23:15.773\ninto my virtual machine's folder, so\n\n471\n00:23:15.773 --> 00:23:19.537\nkind of a long path here\nthat I'm browsing into.\n\n472\n00:23:19.537 --> 00:23:24.786\nBut when I start to take a look in\nhere some of these will be real files,\n\n473\n00:23:24.786 --> 00:23:27.390\nfiles that have changed.\n\n474\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.640\nOthers will be links, and\nit's not always obvious.\n\n475\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.760\nAnd if I do an ls-l that\ngives me the long output.\n\n476\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.622\nAnd when I look at the long output\nIt makes it easier to spot which\n\n477\n00:23:39.622 --> 00:23:40.384\nones are links.\n\n478\n00:23:40.384 --> 00:23:45.650\nAnd actually, in this case, none of them\nare links, wow, or they're hard links.\n\n479\n00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.865\nA hard link is where you have multiple\nfiles that all point to the same data and\n\n480\n00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:50.635\nthey all think that they're real files.\n\n481\n00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:53.850\nThey don't know that they're a link but\nthey actually are.\n\n482\n00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.634\nAnd those would show up as regular files.\n\n483\n00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:58.508\nBut it does create a little bit of\nconfusion because you don't necessarily\n\n484\n00:23:58.508 --> 00:23:59.720\nknow what you're looking at.\n\n485\n00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.531\nFrom the GUI, Mac OS takes care\nof all that, it sorts it out.\n\n486\n00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:05.083\nBut from the terminal,\nif you start working with these files,\n\n487\n00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:06.488\nthings can get a little bit dicey.\n\n488\n00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:11.388\nSo Apple recommends that you always\nuse the Time Machine GUI when you work\n\n489\n00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:12.203\nwith this.\n\n490\n00:24:12.203 --> 00:24:14.953\nAnd there is one other way that\nwe can access these backups.\n\n491\n00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:18.704\nWhat if our system is so\nmessed up that we can't even boot it up?\n\n492\n00:24:18.704 --> 00:24:20.900\nWhat if our system caught on fire,\nand it just burned up, and\n\n493\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.902\nwe dropped it in the trash?\n\n494\n00:24:21.902 --> 00:24:22.715\n&gt;&gt; Terrible.\n\n495\n00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:25.312\n&gt;&gt; You go and you buy a new Mac.\n\n496\n00:24:25.312 --> 00:24:27.799\n&gt;&gt; You can plug in your\ntime machine disk and\n\n497\n00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:31.832\nyou can restore your entire computer\nfrom the time machine disk.\n\n498\n00:24:31.832 --> 00:24:35.436\nIf you boot to recovery, one of the\noptions is to restore from time machine\n\n499\n00:24:35.436 --> 00:24:37.800\nand you can put all of your data back.\n\n500\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.690\nAnd it's like nothing ever happened.\n\n501\n00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.215\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n502\n00:24:40.215 --> 00:24:41.180\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou're just right back to where you were.\n\n503\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.230\nSome really impressive stuff and\nit's all designed to be super duper easy.\n\n504\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.758\nEven the hardcore Microsoft fanboys\nwhen they see time machine and\n\n505\n00:24:49.758 --> 00:24:52.152\nhow easy it is to use,\nthey get a bit jealous.\n\n506\n00:24:52.152 --> 00:24:56.396\nBecause the backup offerings for other\noperating systems are nowhere near as\n\n507\n00:24:56.396 --> 00:24:58.953\nconvenient as what we\nhave with time machine.\n\n508\n00:24:58.953 --> 00:25:00.741\nIt so simple and easy.\n\n509\n00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:03.391\nAll you have to do is remember to\nplug in your time machine disk.\n\n510\n00:25:03.391 --> 00:25:06.622\nCan't backup if it's not plugged in\nunless you have a network server.\n\n511\n00:25:06.622 --> 00:25:09.645\nOn a network server, you just bring\nyour computer into that network, and\n\n512\n00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:11.570\nnow it'll start backing\nup over the network.\n\n513\n00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.239\nSo you can make it super automated,\nsuper easy, and now your data is safe.\n\n514\n00:25:16.239 --> 00:25:18.025\n[APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; Excellent presentation as always, Don.\n\n515\n00:25:18.025 --> 00:25:19.035\nThank you very much.\n\n516\n00:25:19.035 --> 00:25:21.904\nTime machine, love this episode.\n\n517\n00:25:21.904 --> 00:25:23.960\nBefore we leave though, anything else?\n\n518\n00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.429\n&gt;&gt; Two things that I just thought of\nthat I didn't mention in this show.\n\n519\n00:25:27.429 --> 00:25:30.582\nOne is when you back up to\na network server, you can actually\n\n520\n00:25:30.582 --> 00:25:34.883\nencrypt your backup just like on a local\ndisk, so they both support encryption.\n\n521\n00:25:34.883 --> 00:25:36.431\nThey do it a different way,\nbut they support it.\n\n522\n00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:37.611\nThe wizard looks the same so\n\n523\n00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:40.293\nyou don't actually know that\nit's done two different ways.\n\n524\n00:25:40.293 --> 00:25:44.202\nBut it does support encryption and it's\neven more important on a network share,\n\n525\n00:25:44.202 --> 00:25:46.973\ncuz more people would have\naccess to that network share.\n\n526\n00:25:46.973 --> 00:25:50.720\nThe other thing is if you encrypt\nyour backups you pick a key.\n\n527\n00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.591\nIf you forget that key,\nyou can't unlock your backup.\n\n528\n00:25:55.591 --> 00:25:57.119\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\nApple does not have a way to recover\n\n529\n00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:57.902\nthat backup for you.\n\n530\n00:25:57.902 --> 00:26:01.349\nAnd the only thing worse than having\na failure and not having a backup,\n\n531\n00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:05.392\nis having a backup that you can't use cuz\nyou can't remember the key to unlock it.\n\n532\n00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:06.520\n&gt;&gt; That would be terrible.\n\n533\n00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.794\n&gt;&gt; So absolutely document, write down,\nstore it somewhere safe and secure,\n\n534\n00:26:10.794 --> 00:26:14.752\nbut keep track of what the encryption\nkey is to unlock that hard drive.\n\n535\n00:26:14.752 --> 00:26:18.065\nCuz if you have a failure, you want\nto be able to count on that disk and\n\n536\n00:26:18.065 --> 00:26:21.511\nnot have to say shoot,\nI can't remember the password, what is it.\n\n537\n00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:25.872\nAnd now you can't get at your data and\nnow you're sad.\n\n538\n00:26:25.872 --> 00:26:27.166\n&gt;&gt; It would be a sad thing.\n\n539\n00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:28.802\nYeah.\nBut this isn't a sad thing,\n\n540\n00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:30.613\nthis is a great episode, Time Machine.\n\n541\n00:26:30.613 --> 00:26:34.282\nAnd you know, all the episodes of\nApple Certified Associate are wonderful.\n\n542\n00:26:34.282 --> 00:26:35.944\nSo make sure you see every one of them.\n\n543\n00:26:35.944 --> 00:26:39.069\nDon's done a great job putting together\nall this information for you, and\n\n544\n00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:40.766\nyou'll be in the course library, too.\n\n545\n00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:44.487\nAnd there's thousands of other videos\nthere, and they're there for one reason,\n\n546\n00:26:44.487 --> 00:26:45.562\nto help you go further.\n\n547\n00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:49.100\nSo check those out as well, and\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n548\n00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.106\nYou know ITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n549\n00:26:51.106 --> 00:26:52.591\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n550\n00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.483\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n551\n00:26:53.483 --> 00:26:56.551\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again very soon.\n\n552\n00:26:56.551 --> 00:27:02.420\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.882\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

from\n\n3\n00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:05.701\nSan Francisco California.\n\n4\n00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.666\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:12.560\nYou're watching ITPROTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you.\n\n6\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.520\nFor watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.850\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non, with Apple Certified Associate.\n\n8\n00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.780\nThis episode is running\nWindows applications.\n\n9\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.876\nThat's what we're gonna do with Don Pezet,\nDon great to have you here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:28.426\n&gt;&gt; Great to be back Zach, and\n\n11\n00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:30.962\nthis is a really important episode because\n\n12\n00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:34.810\nthere are a lot of people\n&gt;&gt; That are moving over to the whole\n\n13\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.930\nworld, they are coming from\nthe Microsoft Windows world, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.430\nwhen you make that transition there's a\ncouple of things that are really jarring,\n\n15\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.905\nthey make it really challenging,\nif you're brand new to computers and you\n\n16\n00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:46.485\n&gt;&gt; Just starting out with a Mac,\n\n17\n00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:49.015\nit's super intuitive,\nit's super easy, you snap right in.\n\n18\n00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.785\nBut if you've been\nworking with Windows for\n\n19\n00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:54.185\na while, you've got habits,\nkeyboard shortcuts.\n\n20\n00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.355\nYou have applications that you're used to.\n\n21\n00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:59.703\nAnd moving into Mac OS can be really,\nreally challenging.\n\n22\n00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:02.925\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nhow we can bridge the gap,\n\n23\n00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:07.128\nhow we can make it a little easier to\nmake that transition and take some of\n\n24\n00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:11.842\nthe things that we're dependent on in\nWindows, make them work for us in MacOS.\n\n25\n00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:14.561\nAnd that helps with the transition\nto get you moved over, and\n\n26\n00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:18.028\nworking as efficiently, if not more\nefficiently than you did before when you\n\n27\n00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:20.700\nwere on a Windows platform.\n&gt;&gt; What is the easiest way to get up and\n\n28\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.745\nrunning if we depend on\na Windows applicatioin?\n\n29\n00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:25.353\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's the big question,\n\n30\n00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:25.880\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.580\nMost people don't actually care\nwhat operating system they run.\n\n32\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.920\nWhether they're running Windows or\nMacOS or Linux doesn't really matter.\n\n33\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.853\nIt's the applications that matter.\n\n34\n00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:37.941\nNow, if I have some program that\nI've been using all this time, and\n\n35\n00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.882\nnow I move over to a Mac, I want to\nbe able to use that same program or\n\n36\n00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:44.440\nhave that same functionality.\n\n37\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.664\nWell, ideally, whatever application\nyou're running in Windows,\n\n38\n00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:51.880\nwill have a Mac version also.\n\n39\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.910\nNow it didn't used to be like that.\n\n40\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.990\nIf I was filming this show in the 1990's,\nor even the first decade of the 2000's,\n\n41\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.110\nmany, many companies out there, would go\nto write software and they would say,\n\n42\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.010\nwell, you know, like 90 percent\nof computers run Windows so\n\n43\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.250\nwe'll just make a Windows version and\nthat's that.\n\n44\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.362\nSo when you switched over to a Mac, you\nhad to find some pale shadow, some light\n\n45\n00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:15.690\nimitation of the program that you wanted.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n46\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.739\n&gt;&gt; It was never as good and\n\n47\n00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.626\nit was always missing a ton of features.\n\n48\n00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:24.080\nBut in today's world, right now here\nwe are in 2018, it's a lot different.\n\n49\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.930\nAnd many vendors out there when\nthey create an application,\n\n50\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.490\nthey create a Windows version,\nand a MAC OS version.\n\n51\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.690\nSo when you switch from Windows to MAC,\nyou can just go on and\n\n52\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.340\nfind those applications and\nnow you're running the same program.\n\n53\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.149\nSo for example let's say Google Chrome,\nright the Google Chrome web browser,\n\n54\n00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.741\nI like that one, and maybe I'm running\nWindows and Linux and I'm just using\n\n55\n00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:52.070\nGoogle Chrome like crazy, and then I come\nover to a MAC, and what do I get on a MAC?\n\n56\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.670\nI get Safari, right which even if you're\nan Apple fan voice Safari is pretty bad.\n\n57\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.490\nSo I will use the Safari web browser.\n\n58\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.707\nI might hate that experience and then I\nsay, I use the web brower 90% of my day,\n\n59\n00:03:03.707 --> 00:03:06.780\nthis is terrible,\nI'm going back to Windows.\n\n60\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.312\nWell you don't have to right, because\nGoogle makes a version of Chrome for\n\n61\n00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:16.240\nMac OS so\nIf we were to go to Google.com/chrome,\n\n62\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.330\nwe can browse right over, and\nhere I can download Chrome.\n\n63\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.410\nI can go to download it.\n\n64\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.710\nAnd it's Chrome for Mac.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n65\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.060\n&gt;&gt; And now I can install that.\n\n66\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.450\nAnd I've got the same program that I\nused on Windows, running here on Mac.\n\n67\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.280\nSome of the other vendors that\nare out there do something similar.\n\n68\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.630\nSo for example Microsoft Office.\n\n69\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.970\nMost businesses run Windows\nbecause of Microsoft Office.\n\n70\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.710\nMicrosoft Word, Microsoft Excel,\nthose are staple products for businesses.\n\n71\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.968\nWell, Microsoft started to release\nMac versions of Office 15 years ago,\n\n72\n00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:51.280\na long time ago, 20 years ago.\n\n73\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.990\nBut they were pale shadows.\n\n74\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.300\nExcel for Mac was nowhere near as\npowerful as Excel for Windows.\n\n75\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.230\nAnd on the email side, Microsoft Outlook,\nit didn't have a Mac counterpart.\n\n76\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.230\nYou had Entourage, which was horrible.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, Microsoft has made some big\n\n78\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.270\nstrides, and\nnow their versions are much more aligned.\n\n79\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.018\nBut if you're running Microsoft Word for\nMac,\n\n80\n00:04:15.018 --> 00:04:18.324\nit's pretty much the same as\nMicrosoft Word on Windows.\n\n81\n00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:22.370\nMicrosoft Excel on Mac is pretty much\nthe same as Microsoft Excel on Windows.\n\n82\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.660\nIn fact, I've got them installed here,\nif I pull up Excel.\n\n83\n00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.620\nSo I'm on my Mac.\n\n84\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.510\nI'm running Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra, and\nI have an Office 365 subscription with\n\n85\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.530\nMicrosoft, so\nthat gets you access to the apps.\n\n86\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.320\nAnd so, here, I've got Excel, and\nI can fire up a blank workbook.\n\n87\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.335\nAnd I can jump in, and I can start\nworking with a spreadsheet, and\n\n88\n00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:47.940\ndoing all the amazing things\nthat spreadsheets do.\n\n89\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.588\nWe're about to see the limitations of my\nExcel knowledge, which Sum of two cells.\n\n90\n00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:58.730\nWoo hoo 2+2 is 4,\nwe've revolutionized accounting.\n\n91\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.106\n&gt;&gt; You've done it by Jove.\n\n92\n00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:01.849\n&gt;&gt; But the key point here is,\n\n93\n00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.889\nif I love Excel, and\nthat's an important program to me, and\n\n94\n00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.080\nI need Excel for my life to be complete.\n\n95\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.950\nFirst off I need to evaluate\nmy life choices, but\n\n96\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.710\nsecondly I can switch over\nto Mac because I can run.\n\n97\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.930\nExcel, right?\n\n98\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.690\nIf I were to switch over to Linux,\nI can't run Excel.\n\n99\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.240\nI would lose it.\n\n100\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.112\nSo, if I can,\nI wanna find a mac compatible counterpart.\n\n101\n00:05:25.112 --> 00:05:28.570\nA version of that software\nthat runs on macOS.\n\n102\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.000\nBut it's not always possible.\n\n103\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.990\nThere are some programs that don't.\n\n104\n00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.840\nSo, for example back in my Windows days.\n&gt;&gt; There was a day.\n\n105\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.424\n&gt;&gt; There was a program that I used.\n\n106\n00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:40.370\nCalled Notepad++.\n\n107\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.050\nAnd I love Notepad++,\nit just a great little text editor.\n\n108\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.100\nIt's free, you go their website,\n\n109\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.490\nyou download it but, it's Windows only.\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n\n110\n00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.130\n&gt;&gt; they released it just for Windows and\n\n111\n00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.110\nactually a little while ago\nthey announced a Linux version.\n\n112\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.050\nI don't know if they ever released it or\nnot, let's find out.\n\n113\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:07.410\nSo here they've got downloads for Windows\nand actually it looks like just Windows.\n\n114\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.660\nSo if I wanna run Notepad ++ on my Mac,\nI can't.\n\n115\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.590\nThey don't make it for Mac OS, so\nI've got to go and find something similar.\n\n116\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.570\nAnd you might have noticed,\nwhen I was on Google's website and\n\n117\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.445\nI started doing a search, right.\n\n118\n00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.322\nI type notepad++, and\n\n119\n00:06:23.322 --> 00:06:27.440\nlook at the suggestions\n&gt;&gt; The first suggestion is notepad++,\n\n120\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.758\nwhat's the second one?\n\n121\n00:06:28.758 --> 00:06:33.460\nNotepad++ Mac Other people are doing\nthe same search that I am.\n\n122\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.490\nLike can I get to store it on Mac or\nrun on Linux right?\n\n123\n00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.010\nAnd they just don't make one So\n\n124\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.960\nif you do a search what you'll start\nto find, are alternatives to notepad++.\n\n125\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.630\nWhat's something else that you can use?\n\n126\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.050\nAnd I went through this years ago.\n\n127\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.111\nAnd ultimately I found that, there was\nanother program called Sublime Text,\n\n128\n00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:51.163\nthat I switched to.\n\n129\n00:06:51.163 --> 00:06:54.270\nAnd Sublime runs on Windows, Mac,\nand Linux, a multi platform.\n\n130\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.910\nIt did everything I needed.\n\n131\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.660\nI switched over to it.\n\n132\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.630\nThis was probably five years ago.\n\n133\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.550\nI haven't run notepad++ since.\n\n134\n00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.439\nSo sometimes you can find an alternative\nprogram that lines up and\n\n135\n00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.077\ngives you all the features you need.\n\n136\n00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:06.700\nSometimes you can't.\n\n137\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.010\nAnd if you can't,\nnow you've got a really big challenge.\n\n138\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.305\nBut hopefully,\nyou can find that alternative.\n\n139\n00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.740\nYou get the program running, and\nnow you're up and you're going.\n\n140\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.770\nMicrosoft Visio and\nMicrosoft Project are two other examples.\n\n141\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.330\nMicrosoft Portal over\nall these Office apps.\n\n142\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.760\nBut not Visio and Project.\n\n143\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.550\nAnd there's no Mac version of them.\n\n144\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.290\nSo you have to find some\nthird party solution.\n\n145\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.050\nAnd there's a couple out there that\nare okay, but Visio and Project are so\n\n146\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.580\nubiquitous in their space that people,\nexpect you to use those and\n\n147\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.590\nnot some third-party program.\n\n148\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.212\nSo that creates a bit of a challenge\nthere,that we do when bumping it.\n\n149\n00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:40.121\n&gt;&gt; So you've already touched on it, but\n\n150\n00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:43.652\nwhat if there isn't a Mac equivalent?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n151\n00:07:43.652 --> 00:07:48.488\nso let say for example that,\nI have to have Microsoft Visio, right?\n\n152\n00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:52.656\nAnd I look and I can't find\na similar product to Visio, right?\n\n153\n00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:57.244\nOr I can find something that are similar\nbut they don't have all the features that\n\n154\n00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:01.374\nI need, or maybe Maybe I have some\nrequirement where I have to use Vizio.\n\n155\n00:08:01.374 --> 00:08:02.751\nI can't use some alternative, right?\n\n156\n00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.720\nThe Vizio is generating VSD documents,\nand I've got to have VSD documents.\n\n157\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.151\nSo I can't use a third party.\n\n158\n00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.580\nWell, there's a few solutions\nthat are available, right?\n\n159\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.200\nSo the one I'm mentioning is find\na replacement, so that's the first thing.\n\n160\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.720\nBut if that fails, like what Zach said,\nI do have two more choices, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.780\nMy second choice is I can\nuse Virtualization software.\n\n162\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.150\nVirtualization software lets me run\nWindows in a virtual machine on my Mac,\n\n163\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.600\nand I can leverage that to\nrun the programs that I need.\n\n164\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.980\nAnd then there's a third\noption which is Boot Camp.\n\n165\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.510\nAnd Boot Camp is where I can\nactually install Windows on my Mac,\n\n166\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.720\ninstalling it on the hardware to be\nable to run applications there as well.\n\n167\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.010\nAnd they all have their little pros and\ncons, some benefits.\n\n168\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.737\nLet me just show you because I actually\ndo have Windows in a virtual machine in\n\n169\n00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:51.386\nthe background.\n\n170\n00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:54.650\nFor my example,\nlet's use Internet Explorer, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.830\nOr Microsoft Edge, right?\n\n172\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.480\nThat's Microsoft's web browser.\n\n173\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.650\nSo let's pretend for a moment,\nthat I'm a web developer.\n\n174\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.126\nAny of you who've know me,\nare laughing right now.\n\n175\n00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:05.639\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.623\n&gt;&gt; Let's pretend that I'm a web developer.\n\n177\n00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:08.310\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't going to say anything.\n\n178\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so as a web developer,\n\n179\n00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:12.760\nI write a web page, and\nI need to make sure it works for everyone.\n\n180\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.471\nWell I can test it in Google Chrome,\nMozilla Firefox, and\n\n181\n00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.520\nSafari cuz all three of\nthem have Mac versions.\n\n182\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.144\nBut there's no Mac version\nof Microsoft Edge and\n\n183\n00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:24.960\nthere's no Mac version\nof Internet Explorer 11.\n\n184\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.610\nSo how can I test those on my Mac?\n\n185\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.700\nAnd I can't find an alternative cuz\nthe alternative aren't the same.\n\n186\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.520\nI need to test on Internet Explorer,\nso how do I do it?\n\n187\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.252\nWell, I use a product call VMware Fusion.\n\n188\n00:09:37.252 --> 00:09:40.156\nVMware Fusion is a from\na company called VMware which\n\n189\n00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:41.140\nactually-\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n190\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.890\n&gt;&gt; Run by Dell, but anyhow, so\n\n191\n00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.980\nVMware Fusion.\n\n192\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:51.286\nAnd what it lets me do is it lets\nme run other operating systems\n\n193\n00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:56.918\nin the background on my machine,\nit's like a secondary thing.\n\n194\n00:09:56.918 --> 00:09:59.065\nThere's other products that do this,\nParallels,\n\n195\n00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.226\nthis is probably the other\nbig player in this space.\n\n196\n00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.590\nThey're both priced about the same.\n\n197\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.495\nI think it's something like between 50 and\n$70.\n\n198\n00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.592\nI have the pro version which is-\n&gt;&gt; Is that a one time\n\n199\n00:10:08.592 --> 00:10:11.318\npurchase, Don?\n&gt;&gt; Well they do upgrades over the years\n\n200\n00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:15.550\ninstead of you having to renew it,\nlooks like a one time purchase, but\n\n201\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.945\nit really isn't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:10:16.945 --> 00:10:19.618\n&gt;&gt; But it's very powerful software because\n\n203\n00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:23.128\nonce it's installed,\nI can run Windows inside of it,\n\n204\n00:10:23.128 --> 00:10:26.545\nand I've actually got\nthat running right here.\n\n205\n00:10:26.545 --> 00:10:29.227\nHere's Windows 10,\nrunning on a virtual machine.\n\n206\n00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:35.080\nAnd you guys can't see what I did here,\nbut I did a three finger swipe.\n\n207\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.920\nAnd I've got it set up as two\ndifferent desktops on my Mac.\n\n208\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.798\nSo I'm running macOS,\nthis is running on my laptop.\n\n209\n00:10:40.798 --> 00:10:42.820\nAnd then I just three-finger swipe, and\n\n210\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.995\nhere's Windows.\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n211\n00:10:43.995 --> 00:10:46.157\n&gt;&gt; And so if I wanna test something,\n\n212\n00:10:46.157 --> 00:10:50.405\nI can fire up Microsoft Edge, and\nI can go and check out a website or\n\n213\n00:10:50.405 --> 00:10:53.835\nwhatever and\nI'm testing in Microsoft Edge.\n\n214\n00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:55.975\nI wonder if I have\nInternet Explorer even on this?\n\n215\n00:10:55.975 --> 00:10:57.595\nYeah, there, Internet Explorer.\n\n216\n00:10:57.595 --> 00:11:00.833\nSo this is the older Internet Explorer 11,\n\n217\n00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:03.910\nI can fire that up, and\nnow I can test in it.\n\n218\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.341\nSo as a web developer, I come in and\nI say, I've really gotta find another this\n\n219\n00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:12.570\nweb pages compatible works or\nwhatever, and now I can run these.\n\n220\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.301\nThe positive of these,\n\n221\n00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:20.020\nis that because it's the full Windows\noperating system, everything works.\n\n222\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.279\nEverything that I want to test is going\nto work right here, and I can use it cuz\n\n223\n00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:28.090\nthese are the full applications\nrunning on top of Windows, right?\n\n224\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.510\nThe negative side is,\nI have to know Windows, right?\n\n225\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.475\nSo when I do my little three finger swipe,\n\n226\n00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:38.050\nI'm moving from Macland\nover into Windowsland.\n\n227\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.300\nAnd everything is different in Window.\n\n228\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.410\nNow if you're an experienced Windows user,\nthat's fine.\n\n229\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.980\nHey, I'm back in Windows here,\nand now I can do stuff.\n\n230\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.225\nAnd life is great, and so happy, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:50.878\n&gt;&gt; But if you're not a Windows user,\n\n232\n00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.557\nif you're a web developer and\nyou just work on a Mac, and\n\n233\n00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:55.340\nyou just need an Internet Explorer.\n\n234\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.730\nNow you're being confronted with\nthis whole new operating system.\n\n235\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.669\nSo Parallels and\nVMware Fusion, they both have\n\n236\n00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:07.720\na feature that lets you\ncombine the desktops.\n\n237\n00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.620\nAnd VMware they call it a Unity view.\n\n238\n00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.493\nLet me switch this\nmachine into Unity view.\n\n239\n00:12:12.493 --> 00:12:16.651\nSo when I pull up my menu up top,\nyou've got this like View, and\n\n240\n00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:19.250\nright now I'm gonna Full Screen view.\n\n241\n00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.091\nSo I'm seeing a full\nscreen Windows machine.\n\n242\n00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:26.840\nWhen I flip to Unity view,\nthat's gonna change, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.811\nMy other desktop just went away, and\n\n244\n00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:32.703\nthen the screen kind of flickered\na little bit and some things happened.\n\n245\n00:12:32.703 --> 00:12:39.220\nAnd now,\nwhat I'm looking at is Mac desktop, right?\n\n246\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.320\nThere's the star field, right And\nI've got my Apple menu up top.\n\n247\n00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.970\nIf I chose about this Mac,\nI'm running macOS High Sierra, right?\n\n248\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.571\nBut here's Microsoft Edge and\nhere's Internet Explorer 11, and\n\n249\n00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:54.620\nthey're just running in little windows,\njust like any other application.\n\n250\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.848\nIf I look down here at my dock,\nthere's Edge and\n\n251\n00:12:57.848 --> 00:13:02.940\nInternet explorer showing up as\njust regular Mac applications.\n\n252\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.297\nWhen you go into Unity view like this\nthe Windows applications are running in\n\n253\n00:13:07.297 --> 00:13:09.833\nthe Windows VM, but\nI dont' have to see it.\n\n254\n00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:14.480\nI just see the applications, I use them\njust like any other application on my Mac.\n\n255\n00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.667\nIn fact, the only time you notice\nanything weird is when you start dragging\n\n256\n00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:17.300\nthe Windows around.\n\n257\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.210\nWatch when I drag it around.\n\n258\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.400\nSee how it gets a little strange there?\n\n259\n00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.740\nAnd that's because technically it's\noverlaying one monitor on another monitor.\n\n260\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.187\nIf you have a higher end graphics\ncard that won't happen, but\n\n261\n00:13:29.187 --> 00:13:31.450\nmost Macs have the Intel graphics card.\n\n262\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:36.350\nSo we actually see that, but aside from\nthat one screener effect, that rest of it,\n\n263\n00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.720\nit's treated just like a Mac app.\n\n264\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.900\nIf I hit the Maximize window,\nit maximizes it.\n\n265\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.750\nIf I hit the Restore button,\nit goes back to restore mode.\n\n266\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.600\nAnd it's doing it just like I would\non a Mac app and doing it from here.\n\n267\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.273\nIf I go Print, or\nif I go to access the hard drive,\n\n268\n00:13:52.273 --> 00:13:55.814\nit's accessing the Mac hard drive,\nor the printers on the Mac.\n\n269\n00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:59.830\nI don't see the Windows operating systems\nat all, and that's really cool stuff.\n\n270\n00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.411\nAnd in fact, you can even, let's see,\nI don't have it turned on, but\n\n271\n00:14:03.411 --> 00:14:06.515\nthere's a menu you can turn on up\ntop where you can fire it up and\n\n272\n00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:09.650\nyou'll actually see all\nthe Windows applications up there.\n\n273\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:14.430\nAnd you can launch them without ever\ngoing to the operating system at all.\n\n274\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.460\nIt's a really slick system, and\nParallels has this as well.\n\n275\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.498\nVMware Fusion, there's a great way\nto run those Windows applications,\n\n276\n00:14:21.498 --> 00:14:24.310\nbut still have the macOS\nexperience on top of that.\n\n277\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:29.043\nSo virtualization technologies like this\nare really convenient because the end user\n\n278\n00:14:29.043 --> 00:14:31.720\ndoesn't have to retrain themselves.\n\n279\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.570\nIf they know Windows, you can give them\nthe Windows desktop, they flip over to it.\n\n280\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.646\nIf they don't know Windows, you can\nlet them stay on the macOS desktop and\n\n281\n00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:43.939\nyou have the application icons to be able\nto fire up the programs and get at it.\n\n282\n00:14:43.939 --> 00:14:48.051\nI don't think I have it configured,\nbut you can even get it setup so\n\n283\n00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:52.450\nthat when somebody goes to\ntheir applications folder.\n\n284\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.326\nThey'll see Windows\napplications mixed in here.\n\n285\n00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:57.600\nLet's see, I do not have it turned on.\n\n286\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.610\nBut the Windows apps will just show up\nin the regular applications folder.\n\n287\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.384\nSo they don't even realize there's a VM,\nthey double-click on it,\n\n288\n00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:04.378\nit launches something.\n\n289\n00:15:04.378 --> 00:15:06.410\nSo it's really slick stuff.\n\n290\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.832\nOn the exam, Apple doesn't harp on which\nthird party software you use cuz they\n\n291\n00:15:10.832 --> 00:15:13.649\ndon't make one, so\nthey don't make money on it.\n\n292\n00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:17.258\nBut for\nyou just personally the two big leaders,\n\n293\n00:15:17.258 --> 00:15:22.012\nthere's Parallels which is by\na company called Parallels, and\n\n294\n00:15:22.012 --> 00:15:26.645\nthen there is VMware Fusion which is IBM.\n&gt;&gt; So Don how would we go\n\n295\n00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:31.318\nabout finding a replacement?\n&gt;&gt; All right, so in this case, I'm\n\n296\n00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:34.737\nshowing I can run the Windows programs.\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n297\n00:15:34.737 --> 00:15:37.431\n&gt;&gt; Let's say that's just not gonna fly,\n\n298\n00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:42.408\nthat I've got something, maybe I'm\nediting video files, and if I do it\n\n299\n00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:47.244\nin a VM they are to slow, or the screen\nart effects are driving me nuts.\n\n300\n00:15:47.244 --> 00:15:49.960\nOr I just don't want a licenced\nVirtualization software,\n\n301\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.222\nthat's how it is, right?\n\n302\n00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:56.010\nWell, it could be That you\nneed to stay on Windows.\n\n303\n00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.844\nI mean, that could add.\n\n304\n00:15:56.844 --> 00:15:57.913\nThat's not on the test.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:15:57.913 --> 00:15:59.054\n&gt;&gt; In real life, Daniel,\n\n306\n00:15:59.054 --> 00:16:03.046\nthere does come a point where you say, I'm\nso dependent on this software that I just\n\n307\n00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.510\nneed to stay on Windows.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n308\n00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.140\n&gt;&gt; But the odds are,\n\n309\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.720\nyou can find a replacement.\n\n310\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.000\nWhen you find a replacement,\nthe key thing is\n\n311\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.070\nto find something that can work with\nthe documents that you already have.\n\n312\n00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.810\nSo let's use Microsoft Office\nas an example.\n\n313\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.150\nIf I love Microsoft Excel and\nI just want to use Excel, well,\n\n314\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.100\nit's a spreadsheet program.\n\n315\n00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.370\nAnd it generates Excel documents.\n\n316\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.840\nThere's several other spreadsheet programs\nout there that can work with Excel\n\n317\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.745\ndocuments, in fact, Apple makes one,\nthe Apple Numbers App.\n\n318\n00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:33.480\nDo I have that installed, let's see.\n\n319\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.670\nSo if I go into my application,\nlet's see if I have Numbers installed,\n\n320\n00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.750\nI actually have Excel so\nI don't need Numbers.\n\n321\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.670\nHere it is.\n\n322\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.880\nThis is part of the iWorks Suite.\n\n323\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.410\nIt comes free with every Mac.\n\n324\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.510\nIt's not installed by default.\n\n325\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.740\nYou have to go to the app store and\ndownload it.\n\n326\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.000\nBut it is free.\n\n327\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.750\nAnd when you fire up numbers, you can\ntell it, you wanna create a spreadsheet.\n\n328\n00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.470\nI'm gonna create a blank spreadsheet,\nand here we go.\n\n329\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.270\nSo I'm in this spreadsheet.\n\n330\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.310\nAnd I've already said my spreadsheet\nknowledge is extremely limited.\n\n331\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.390\nBut let's see if I can do two plus two.\n\n332\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.091\nAnd I'll say, equals some of this cell and\n\n333\n00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:11.820\nthis cell, and two plus two is four.\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n334\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.170\n&gt;&gt; I typed the same\n\n335\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.250\nformula that I typed in\nMicrosoft Excel into this program.\n\n336\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.050\nIt looks different, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n337\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.780\n&gt;&gt; But it does the same thing.\n\n338\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.590\nAnd when I go to save my file,\nI can save it, but\n\n339\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.950\nI can also choose export to,\nand I can export to Excel.\n\n340\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.430\nI can save it as an Excel file.\n\n341\n00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.010\nSo I can work with other\npeople who are using Excel.\n\n342\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.840\nFinding that cross compatibility\nis really important.\n\n343\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.170\nExcel documents, PDFs, Word documents.\n\n344\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.650\nThose are designed to be opened standard,\n\n345\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.820\nso other people can launch\napplications and read them.\n\n346\n00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.280\nMaybe not the native application that\ncreated it, but some alternative, right.\n\n347\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.540\nI might not run Numbers.\n\n348\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.860\nI might use Open Office,\nright, or Libre Office.\n\n349\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.700\nThose are a couple of open source office\nsuites that are available on the Mac, and\n\n350\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.210\nthey'll work with Excel documents and\nWord documents.\n\n351\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.990\nSo you need to look at the files\nyou're working with, and see, is there\n\n352\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.330\na third party program out there that can\nopen these files and work with them.\n\n353\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.190\nBut still leave them in\nthat native format, so\n\n354\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.400\nthat when other people need access to it,\nthey can have it.\n\n355\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.400\nI mentioned Microsoft Visio, so\nmaybe I need to generate diagrams,\n\n356\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.690\nand whoever I'm generating for has told\nme they've got to be in the Visio format.\n\n357\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.350\nI can't run Visio.\n\n358\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.890\nSo what do I do?\n\n359\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.620\nWell, what I would normally do is\nI would fire up the App store, and\n\n360\n00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.620\nin the App store,\nI'm just gonna search for Vizio, right?\n\n361\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.680\nSo I'm gonna type that in,\nand do a quick search.\n\n362\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.710\nAnd a bunch of stuff comes up,\nhere's a VSD Viewer, all right.\n\n363\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.910\nIf I just need to be able to\nview Vizio diagrams, I can.\n\n364\n00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:43.820\nBut that's not what I need.\n\n365\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.140\nI need to create one.\n\n366\n00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.500\nAnd so I can start looking at a few\nother ones here, viewer, viewer, viewer.\n\n367\n00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.695\nA lot of these seem to be viewers.\n\n368\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.287\nxDiagram, alright, well,\nlets take a look at that one.\n\n369\n00:18:54.287 --> 00:18:57.070\nIt got 27 ratings, four and\na half stars, that's not bad.\n\n370\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.860\nAnd it says, it can help you\nmake a nice diagram graphic.\n\n371\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.710\nIt can use UML documents.\n\n372\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.120\nIt creates lines.\n\n373\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.300\nLines are exciting.\n\n374\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.206\nAnd then, supports Visio formats,\nvsdx, and vsdm.\n\n375\n00:19:09.206 --> 00:19:15.040\nHere's a third-party application\nthat can work with Visio documents.\n\n376\n00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.290\nI can open, and\n\n377\n00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.570\nI can save in the Visio format, and\nmaybe that one will work for me.\n\n378\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.340\nMaybe it won't.\n\n379\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.040\nMaybe this program stinks.\n\n380\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.750\nIt might be the greatest\nprogram on the planet.\n\n381\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.630\nSo you might need to try it out.\n\n382\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.894\nCheck for a demo,\nsometimes they have demos.\n\n383\n00:19:29.894 --> 00:19:32.020\nThis one doesn't, but\nit's $14, it's not much.\n\n384\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.740\nBut if it will serve your need,\nthen that works.\n\n385\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.100\nSo you can go right to the App store,\notherwise you can go into a Google search\n\n386\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.200\nlike I did a few moments ago, and\nthey find applications that way.\n\n387\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.370\nYou'll be surprised what\nyou find that's out there.\n\n388\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:50.030\nThere's typically going to be a way\nto be able to launch into those,\n\n389\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.750\nor to find these applications.\n\n390\n00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.970\nThere's gonna be some third party,\nor some way to deal with it.\n\n391\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.858\nBut sometimes there's a bit,\n\n392\n00:19:55.858 --> 00:19:59.350\nusually there's some kind of way.\n&gt;&gt; So Don, what if I can't find\n\n393\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.409\nan equivalent, and my vendor doesn't\nallow over virtual applications?\n\n394\n00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n395\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.890\nit starts to sound like Zac's\njust giving me a hard time here-\n\n396\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:07.560\n&gt;&gt; I am, I am.\n\n397\n00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.220\n&gt;&gt; But it does happen, right?\n\n398\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.150\nSo here I am, giving you solutions,\nand he's like, well what if I can't do\n\n399\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.410\nany of those, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.690\n&gt;&gt; It could happen.\n\n401\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.280\nIt could happen because of\nlicensing requirements, or\n\n402\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.850\nsome kind of legal thing where they say,\n\n403\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.660\nyou're not allowed to virtualize our\nsoftware, and it has to run on Windows.\n\n404\n00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.060\nThat could happen, and\nthere's just no equivalent.\n\n405\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.730\nIt could be hardware related.\n\n406\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.210\nMaybe there's some specific piece of\nhardware that I need a hardware driver\n\n407\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.180\nfor.\n\n408\n00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.960\nYou'll see this with industrial scanners,\nand 3D printers.\n\n409\n00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.000\nSo I need a driver, and\nthey only make a Windows driver.\n\n410\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.010\nSo even if I had third-party\nsoftware on my Mac,\n\n411\n00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.350\nI won't be able to talk to the hardware.\n\n412\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.960\nIt's effectively useless, all right?\n\n413\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:52.150\nSo in those scenarios,\nthere's no alternative but to run Windows.\n\n414\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.060\nNow, does that mean you throw your Mac\nin the trash, and you go buy an HP?\n\n415\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.400\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.138\n&gt;&gt; We have BootCamp, right?\n\n417\n00:20:59.138 --> 00:21:03.210\nWhat BootCamp does is it allows\nyou to divide your hard drive, and\n\n418\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.830\nset aside a little space for\n\n419\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.780\nthe Windows operating system.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n420\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.240\n&gt;&gt; And when you boot up your Mac,\n\n421\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.070\nwhen you push that power button, you can\npick, do I wanna boot into MacOS, or\n\n422\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.770\ndo I wanna boot into Windows?\n\n423\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.520\nAnd if you boot into Windows,\n\n424\n00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.110\nit actually loads the full Windows\noperating system right on your hardware.\n\n425\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.610\nRemember that Macs have\nan Intel processor in them.\n\n426\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.470\nThe same processor that\nWindows is designed for.\n\n427\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.710\nWindows will run on your Mac hardware.\n\n428\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.070\nAnd so Apple actually has a driver set for\nWindows to be able to do that.\n\n429\n00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.120\nYou can fire it up,\naccess all the resources that you need.\n\n430\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.850\nAnd now you can leverage that program.\n\n431\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.445\nThe problem is you're\nbooting into Windows.\n\n432\n00:21:38.445 --> 00:21:40.180\nSo you won't be able to run\nany your Mac applications.\n\n433\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.210\nBut you can switch back and\n\n434\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.490\nforth as you need, cuz now you\ngot them both on your hardware.\n\n435\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.120\nAnd that's kinda files stuff.\n\n436\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.350\nLike if I absolutely have to, I can still\nhave my Mac, but now I'm running Windows,\n\n437\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.150\nMacOS is still sitting there though,\nso I can flip back and forth.\n\n438\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.550\nNow, quick thing I wanna mention here,\n'cuz I haven't talked about it yet.\n\n439\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.750\nWhen I said licensing,\nit kinda set off a light in my head.\n\n440\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.250\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n441\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm talking about Windows, right?\n\n442\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.080\nIf I run Windows in a virtual machine, or\n\n443\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.570\nif I run Windows in BootCamp,\neither way, I'm installing Windows.\n\n444\n00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.340\nMicrosoft has to get paid for that.\n\n445\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.640\nThat's a paid product.\n\n446\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.890\nThere's no free version of Windows\nthat you can go in and install.\n\n447\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.930\nYou can do demo versions, but there's\nno free long-term one that you can run.\n\n448\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.090\nYou do have to buy a Windows license.\n\n449\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.760\nIf you choose virtualization, you're\npaying for the virtualization software,\n\n450\n00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.970\nwhich there are some free ones,\nlike VirtualBox, that are out there.\n\n451\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.990\nBut I'll tell you VMware Fusion,\nand Parallels.\n\n452\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.000\nThose two are the best.\n\n453\n00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.170\nI like VMware Fusion,\nit's worth the money.\n\n454\n00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.624\nBut then, a Microsoft Windows client\nlicense, it can be upwards to $200.\n\n455\n00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:41.240\nBut you're paying for\nthat operating system.\n\n456\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.940\nWith MacOS, that operating\nsystem comes with your hardware.\n\n457\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.990\nBut, that's not Microsoft, right?\n\n458\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.200\nThey need to get paid for their software,\n\n459\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.630\nneed is the right word there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n460\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.714\n&gt;&gt; But they want to get paid for\n\n461\n00:22:51.714 --> 00:22:53.530\ntheir software.\n&gt;&gt; Have to.\n\n462\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.190\n&gt;&gt; So you do have to make sure that you\n\n463\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.950\ngot a legitimate license,\neven if you're not booted up to it.\n\n464\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.150\nIf you install BootCamp and\nthen you never boot to it,\n\n465\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.990\nit's still an installation of Windows, so\nyou got to make sure you've licensed that.\n\n466\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.870\nSame thing with a virtual machine itself.\n\n467\n00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.470\nThese are all different\nalternatives that give us\n\n468\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.570\naccess to the Windows software\nthat we might be dependent on.\n\n469\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.706\nBut today, so\nmany applications have moved to web-based,\n\n470\n00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:18.800\nthat this argument is\nusually not even necessary.\n\n471\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.730\nYeah, its web-based, whatever,\nI don't care what operating system I'm on.\n\n472\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.590\nAnd that's a good place to be.\n\n473\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.310\nBut there are alternatives, Apple's given\nus a number of different options here.\n\n474\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.820\nSo that we can still access\napplications that we're dependent on.\n\n475\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Well said Sir,\n\n476\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.970\nrunning Windows applications,\ngreat episode as usual, Don.\n\n477\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.890\nAnd before we move on, last word, Sir.\n&gt;&gt; You know, I mentioned BootCamp,\n\n478\n00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:39.940\nbut I didn't actually show it.\n\n479\n00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.750\nAnd the main reason is it\ntakes a long time to set up.\n\n480\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.800\nSo we're gonna do that\nin an extra episode.\n\n481\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.980\nSo if you're frustrated right now,\nsaying he didn't show BootCamp, look for\n\n482\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.730\nthe BootCamp episode.\n\n483\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.370\nWe’re gonna walk through\nthe whole process.\n\n484\n00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.710\nSetting up from start to finish, and\nget Windows running on an actual Mac.\n\n485\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.000\nIt will be a lot of fun.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Don.\n\n486\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.280\nAnd make sure you see every

California.\n\n3\n00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.533\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.648\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.957\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:13.050\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.150\nEmpowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.210\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non, with Apple Certified Associate.\n\n9\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.460\nThe title of this episode,\nget ready for it, Boot Camp.\n\n10\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.630\nAnd our sergeant in arms\nis gonna be Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.970\nDon, thanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.161\nI was really tempted to try the drill\ninstructor voice for this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I thought you might.\n\n15\n00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:37.366\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I can keep it going for\n30 minutes without losing my voice.\n\n16\n00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.575\nSo we'll have to settle for\nmy normal voice,\n\n17\n00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:41.740\nas we jump into the world\nof Apple Boot Camp.\n\n18\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.054\nWhich we'd eluded to in other episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:44.960\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n20\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.962\nWe talked about being able to run\nthe Microsoft Windows operating system,\n\n21\n00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:53.320\non top of our Apple hardware well Boot\nCamp is the system that lets us do that.\n\n22\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.970\nIt is a little bit intimidating,\nespecially for\n\n23\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.420\nusers that have never done it before.\n\n24\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.647\nBut we´re gonna walk through that\nprocess right here in this episode,\n\n25\n00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:02.203\nsee how it works, get a setup, and\n\n26\n00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:05.696\nyou´ll by the end of this episode that\nit´s really not that bad, and it gives\n\n27\n00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:09.435\nsome extra functionality out of your\nhardware that you wouldn't normally have.\n\n28\n00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.550\n&gt;&gt; And Don this is right.\n\n29\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.322\nYou did touch on Boot Camp\nin previous episodes, but\n\n30\n00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.537\nwhat is the scenario where we\nwould actually need Boot Camp?\n\n31\n00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:20.043\n&gt;&gt; All right so the main place that we\nreferred to was in the running Windows\n\n32\n00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:22.793\napplication episode\n&gt;&gt; Where I talk about all these different\n\n33\n00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:25.342\nways to run Windows apps,\nthat were far easier, right?\n\n34\n00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:27.380\n[LAUGH] That we'd normally want.\n\n35\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.440\nFor example, if I'm moving from\nWindows environment to MacOS, and\n\n36\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.215\nI used a program like sublime text.\n\n37\n00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:37.520\nWell, they make a version of that,\nfrom MacOS.\n\n38\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.300\nSo I just go on and\nget a Mac version and that's that.\n\n39\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.940\nProblem solved,\nthe episode's over, you're done.\n\n40\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.500\nBut, there's plenty of programs\nwhere you can't do that.\n\n41\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.436\nSo, for example, NotePad ++ was\nthe example I gave in the other episode,\n\n42\n00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:52.893\nthat they have a Windows version,\nthey don't have a Mac version.\n\n43\n00:01:52.893 --> 00:01:56.290\nSo I could find some alternate\nversion of that software,\n\n44\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.425\nsome other competing text editor.\n\n45\n00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:01.003\nBut if I really love NotePad\n++ I've gotta have it,\n\n46\n00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:02.850\nthen I have to run it on top of Windows.\n\n47\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.817\nSo, in that episode I showed you how\nto do that in a virtual machine,\n\n48\n00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:08.350\nI think I used VMWare Fusion\nif I remember right.\n\n49\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.550\nI fired up the VM in there,\nand now you can run Notepad++.\n\n50\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.812\nBut that involves a virtual machine, and\n\n51\n00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:15.729\nvirtual machines can be\na little dicey in a few areas.\n\n52\n00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:20.348\nOne it's complex right, and most end users\ndon't understand virtual machines, or\n\n53\n00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.330\nwant to have to manage that.\n\n54\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.380\nYou can make it simple, but\nit's a little more than one.\n\n55\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.810\nThe second thing is that, you might\nhave specific hardware requirements.\n\n56\n00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.181\nI might have some Windows software, that\ndepends on a piece of hardware that only\n\n57\n00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.670\nhas Windows driver and\nI can't run it inside a virtual machine.\n\n58\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.878\nI've got to run it on the bare metal,\nand that is where Boot Camp comes in,\n\n59\n00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:49.002\nBoot Camp, lets just install\nthe Microsoft Windows operating system,\n\n60\n00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.102\nright on our Apple hardware.\n\n61\n00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:55.439\nMicrosoft Windows operating system\nruns on Intel and AMD processors,\n\n62\n00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.645\nwell, every Mac that's all these\ndays has an Intel processor in it.\n\n63\n00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.482\nSo it's standard PC hardware.\n\n64\n00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:05.475\nAll right, Apple made a lot of it, but\nthe technology itself comes from Intel and\n\n65\n00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:06.709\nWindows supports it, so\n\n66\n00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.196\nthere's really no reason why we\ncan't just install Windows on here.\n\n67\n00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:12.070\nWell, there's a little reason.\n\n68\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.192\nThe bios that manages your entire Mac,\nis built by Apple and\n\n69\n00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:21.646\nis closed-source to Apple, and so\nthey control what can run on the hardware.\n\n70\n00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:25.495\nBut they're confident enough in their own\noperating system, they say, hey, look,\n\n71\n00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:28.890\nif you need to run Windows,\nwe'll let you, we'll help you out.\n\n72\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.311\nAnd what Boot Camp let's us do,\nis kind of divide our computer in half,\n\n73\n00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:33.803\ngive it split personalities.\n\n74\n00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:38.140\nSo that it's got one personality of MacOS,\nand another personality of Windows.\n\n75\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.974\nAnd when we push the power button, we then\nget to pick, do I wanna boot to Windows,\n\n76\n00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:44.602\nor do I wanna boot to MacOS?\n\n77\n00:03:44.602 --> 00:03:49.580\nAnd if I boot to MacOS, I'm in regular\nMacOS, just like normal, I'm using my Mac.\n\n78\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.909\nIf I boot to Windows though, Windows fires\nup, and now I've got my applications, and\n\n79\n00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.069\nwe can get up and running with\nwhatever it is that we need there.\n\n80\n00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.960\nBut it's not running\nthem at the same time.\n\n81\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.750\nWhen I showed virtualization like VMWare\nFusion, that let me run, Windows and\n\n82\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.894\nMac OS at the same time, and\neven mix them together so\n\n83\n00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.196\nthe apps from one show up in the other.\n\n84\n00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:14.101\nThat's really cool stuff and\nit's super convenient.\n\n85\n00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:15.944\nYou get the best of both worlds.\n\n86\n00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:17.784\nWith Boot Camp, you don't.\n\n87\n00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:20.730\nYou boot-up and you boot to one world,\nor you boot to the other.\n\n88\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.335\nYou can't be in both at the same time.\n\n89\n00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:26.010\nSo, if you're in the Windows world,\nyou're just seeing Windows.\n\n90\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.330\nAnd if you're go into the MacOS\nworld you're just seeing MacOS, and\n\n91\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.830\nthat the apps that are associated with it.\n\n92\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.454\nSo, keep that in mind as you try and\n\n93\n00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:34.978\nfigure out which of these\nsolutions is right for you.\n\n94\n00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:40.140\nShould I use of VM, should I use Boot\nCamp, should I find some other software?\n\n95\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.890\nThe sure answer is yes, right?\n\n96\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.358\nAll of those work, but\n\n97\n00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:48.933\nfind the one that does matches up to\nyour scenario to pick the you need.\n\n98\n00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:49.793\n&gt;&gt; Split personality.\n\n99\n00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:51.862\nDoes Boot Camp work on every Mac?\n\n100\n00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:52.770\nYou know it does.\n\n101\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.940\nAt least, as of this episode being filmed,\nthe main requirements for Boot Camp.\n\n102\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.390\nYou have to have an Intel processor,\nwhich all of the Macs do, not iPads or\n\n103\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.010\niPhones, right?\n\n104\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.430\nThey use ARM processors.\n\n105\n00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.180\nNot ARMs, Cortex processors.\n\n106\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.420\nThey're different, and\nthey're not the same.\n\n107\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.770\nSo, that's not gonna work.\n\n108\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.617\nBut, as far as Macs go.\n\n109\n00:05:11.617 --> 00:05:16.049\nAll the MacBooks, the iMacs,\nMac Minis, Mac Pros MacBook Airs,\n\n110\n00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.120\nall of them support Boot Camp.\n\n111\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.644\nThe main thing that you have to\nwatch out for is disk space.\n\n112\n00:05:21.644 --> 00:05:23.574\nYou do need a bit of disk space,\n\n113\n00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:29.093\nMicrosoft's requirement is 40 gigs of hard\ndrive space, and at least 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n114\n00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:32.080\nWell, pretty much every\nMac has 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n115\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.990\nYou can actually do 1 gig,\neven though they tell you 2 gigs.\n\n116\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.374\n2 GB of RAM is the requirement, 1 GB is\nenough to get it going, but it'll be slow.\n\n117\n00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:40.430\nYou really want two or more.\n\n118\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.757\nPretty much every Mac has that these days.\n\n119\n00:05:42.757 --> 00:05:47.000\nSo, the hard drive space,\nwe need 40 gigs of hard drive space.\n\n120\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.840\nWell, every Mac comes with a hard\ndrive bigger than 40 gigs.\n\n121\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.750\nIn fact, I think if you do\nthe cheapest MacBook Air,\n\n122\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.260\nI think you can get a 128 gig drive.\n\n123\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.707\nThat would be the smallest, right?\n\n124\n00:05:57.707 --> 00:06:00.368\nSo you might look at that and say,\nI definitely got tons of space.\n\n125\n00:06:00.368 --> 00:06:04.415\nWell, we need 40 gigs of free hard\ndrive space, it needs to be empty.\n\n126\n00:06:04.415 --> 00:06:07.989\nBecause what's gonna happen is the hard\ndrive has to get divided, right?\n\n127\n00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:12.964\nMAC OS uses either the MAC OS\nextended journal file system, or\n\n128\n00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:15.463\nAPFS, the Apple file system.\n\n129\n00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:17.345\nWindows can't read those.\n\n130\n00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:20.254\nWell that's not entirely true,\nit can read it but it can't write to it.\n\n131\n00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:23.242\nBut Windows can't use that file system.\n\n132\n00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:26.790\nWindows, is the NTFS file system.\n\n133\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.823\nApple can read the NTFS file system,\nbut it can't write to it.\n\n134\n00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:34.971\nSo they can't write to each other's file\nsystem, so they can't share a file system.\n\n135\n00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.174\nThat means I'm gonna have to divide\nmy hard drive up into volumes.\n\n136\n00:06:38.174 --> 00:06:40.820\nOne volume for Windows,\none volume for Mac OS.\n\n137\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.086\nAnd when they boot,\nthey boot to their own volume.\n\n138\n00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:46.130\nSo I need 40 gigs of free space.\n\n139\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.307\nTo be able to set aside for Windows.\n\n140\n00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:50.932\nNow, I'll tell you,\n40 gigs is not a lot of space.\n\n141\n00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:53.820\nYou're usually going to want 100 gigs or\nmore, because,\n\n142\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.830\nyou need the operating system installed.\n\n143\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.907\nBut then all of the other applications and\ndocuments that you're gonna install, too.\n\n144\n00:06:58.907 --> 00:07:01.080\nSo disk space is your big limiting factor.\n\n145\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.668\nOtherwise the hardware on\npretty much every modern\n\n146\n00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:05.905\nMac supports running Bootcamp if you want.\n\n147\n00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:08.961\nNow that's gonna change in the future.\n\n148\n00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.167\nBut for right now, every Mac made\nin the last, probably the last,\n\n149\n00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:14.815\nten years can run Boot Camp,\nand get this up and going.\n\n150\n00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:18.251\n&gt;&gt; So can we see a Boot Camp\ninstallation right here on the show?\n\n151\n00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:19.378\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:22.574\nIt's a little bit weird that the way I\nnormally share my video doesn't quite work\n\n153\n00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:24.041\nwhen we start booting into Windows.\n\n154\n00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.154\nSo I have to have things up\na little differently but,\n\n155\n00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.300\nI've got a Mac Mini here on my desk,\nwhat we're looking at right here.\n\n156\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.480\nIt's pretty much just a clean\ninstall of MacOS High Sierra.\n\n157\n00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.397\nI haven't really done anything\non here to customize it.\n\n158\n00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:39.268\nAnd what I can do,\nis I can take this machine, and\n\n159\n00:07:39.268 --> 00:07:42.500\nget it set up for Boot Camp, right?\n\n160\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.520\nSo Apple has a couple of recommended steps\nto go through to get Boot Camp set up and\n\n161\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.530\nput in place.\n\n162\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.640\nAnd one of the first steps that they\nrecommend, is backup your data, right?\n\n163\n00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n164\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.812\n&gt;&gt; I have a fresh install, I don't really\nhave any data on here that I care about,\n\n165\n00:07:56.812 --> 00:08:00.654\nbut if this was a machine that I have been\nusing, and have programs and documents,\n\n166\n00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:04.217\nAny time you resize your hard drive,\nany time you divide up your hard drive,\n\n167\n00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.108\nthere's a chance, a small chance, but\n\n168\n00:08:06.108 --> 00:08:08.147\nthere is a chance you\ncould lose your data.\n\n169\n00:08:08.147 --> 00:08:10.515\nIf you have a time machine\nbackup that's no big deal.\n\n170\n00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:13.845\nYou can just restore from time machine and\nyou're back in business.\n\n171\n00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:16.107\nIf you don't have a time\nmachine backup though,\n\n172\n00:08:16.107 --> 00:08:18.050\nthat's where you can run into problems.\n\n173\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.425\nYou lose some data and now you don't\nhave any operating system, better yet\n\n174\n00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:23.611\nWindows and Mac OS.\n\n175\n00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:26.350\nThe next thing we need to do is we\nneed to do our system updates, right?\n\n176\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.983\nBoot Camp, you'll see it here in a minute,\n\n177\n00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:29.981\nwe gonna use what's called\nthe Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n178\n00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:33.893\nIt's a wizard, a program that's gonna\nwalk us through this whole process, and\n\n179\n00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:35.627\nit gets updated quite frequently.\n\n180\n00:08:35.627 --> 00:08:38.543\nAnd the reason is every time\nMicrosoft does some kind of update,\n\n181\n00:08:38.543 --> 00:08:42.216\nsomething changes, Apple's got to realign\nBoot Camp to be able to handle that.\n\n182\n00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:46.742\nWell, fortunately those updates come right\nalong with our regular macOS updates, so\n\n183\n00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:50.028\nif you just fire up your app store and\ngo to your updates up here,\n\n184\n00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:52.388\nyou can do a quick double check and\nmake sure.\n\n185\n00:08:52.388 --> 00:08:55.094\nIt looks like I've already got\nthe latest ones, I can see that, sweet,\n\n186\n00:08:55.094 --> 00:08:56.856\nI've got the newest version of iTunes,\nwoohoo!\n\n187\n00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:57.960\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n188\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.716\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] anyhow,\njust double check your updates.\n\n189\n00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:03.443\nMake sure that you are up to\ndate before you do Boot Camp.\n\n190\n00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:05.148\nReally good idea to do that.\n\n191\n00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:05.731\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:08.473\n&gt;&gt; Okay, once we've done that, we backed\nup our data, and we've done our updates.\n\n193\n00:09:08.473 --> 00:09:11.689\nAnd those are two things that you're\nprobably already doing, so we didn't\n\n194\n00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.068\nreally have to do, but we wanna make sure\nthat we've got those things in place.\n\n195\n00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:19.075\nAfter that,\nwe need to get a USB key, all right?\n\n196\n00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:23.676\nYou have to have a USB key to do this\ninstall, and the reason is when it goes to\n\n197\n00:09:23.676 --> 00:09:27.490\ninstall Windows, it has to boot\noff of an installable media.\n\n198\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.504\nAnd the USB key is\nthe easiest way to do that so\n\n199\n00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:32.569\nI've got a little USB key right\nhere in my hand that I'm gonna use.\n\n200\n00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:35.999\nIt does need to be at\nleast 8 gigabytes in size.\n\n201\n00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:36.616\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n202\n00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:40.502\n&gt;&gt; The Microsoft Windows Installer is\nabout 5 gigabytes so that's too big for\n\n203\n00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:44.645\na 4-gig USB key which are the free ones\nthey normally give away at conferences So\n\n204\n00:09:44.645 --> 00:09:48.672\nyou need at least an eight gigabyte,\nthey're cheap, so it's no big deal.\n\n205\n00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:52.384\nThe Windows installers are gonna need to\nbe copied to here as well as the Apple\n\n206\n00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:53.196\nsupport files,\n\n207\n00:09:53.196 --> 00:09:56.619\nwhich include a bunch of hardware\ndrivers that match up with your Mac.\n\n208\n00:09:56.619 --> 00:10:00.254\nThose are about 800 megs in size,\nso you're looking at about six and\n\n209\n00:10:00.254 --> 00:10:02.615\na half gigs of data that\nneeds to get copied, so\n\n210\n00:10:02.615 --> 00:10:06.935\nyou've got to have a USB key that can hold\nit, so that's why I say get an 8-gig one.\n\n211\n00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:10.892\nThe other thing is make sure there's no\ndata on this USB key that you care about,\n\n212\n00:10:10.892 --> 00:10:13.862\nbecause the USB key will get\nformatted as part of the setup.\n\n213\n00:10:13.862 --> 00:10:18.543\nThe odds are your USB key is formatted\nMac OS extended journalled anyway, or\n\n214\n00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:19.358\nmaybe APFS.\n\n215\n00:10:19.358 --> 00:10:23.377\nIn order to get Boot Camp running,\nit's gonna format your USB key,\n\n216\n00:10:23.377 --> 00:10:28.047\nas I believe it's FAT32, the different\nfile system that Windows can read.\n\n217\n00:10:28.047 --> 00:10:29.974\nSo it's gonna get\nformatted a different way.\n\n218\n00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:31.151\nYou'll lose your data.\n\n219\n00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:36.027\nI'm going to take my USB key and\nplug it into my Mac Mini here.\n\n220\n00:10:36.027 --> 00:10:38.384\nSo I'll see that pop up\nhere in just a moment.\n\n221\n00:10:38.384 --> 00:10:39.965\nThere it is, all right.\n\n222\n00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:44.519\nSo I've got my USB key present,\nI've done my updates, I've done my backup,\n\n223\n00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.107\nI've moved through that.\n\n224\n00:10:46.107 --> 00:10:52.282\nNext, the only other thing I'm gonna\nhave is a copy of Windows, right?\n\n225\n00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:54.964\nWe're gonna run Microsoft Windows.\n\n226\n00:10:54.964 --> 00:10:57.864\nThat means, I need to go out and\nbuy Microsoft Windows.\n\n227\n00:10:57.864 --> 00:10:59.844\nAnd you can buy in two different ways.\n\n228\n00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:04.576\nThe first method, you can go right down to\nyour local package store, like Best Buy or\n\n229\n00:11:04.576 --> 00:11:05.321\nsomewhere.\n\n230\n00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:06.850\nThere's getting to be fewer and\nfewer of those.\n\n231\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n232\n00:11:07.453 --> 00:11:10.728\n&gt;&gt; And you can buy a copy of\nWindows right off the shelf, and\n\n233\n00:11:10.728 --> 00:11:14.226\nit will have a USB key in it that\nhas Microsoft Windows on it.\n\n234\n00:11:14.226 --> 00:11:17.293\nIn fact, if you've got that key,\nyou can just use that for this process,\n\n235\n00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:18.837\nyou don't have to make another one.\n\n236\n00:11:18.837 --> 00:11:21.320\nBut, most of us these days\nare gonna be buying it online.\n\n237\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.687\nAnd when you buy it online from Microsoft,\n\n238\n00:11:23.687 --> 00:11:26.596\nthey're going to give you\na file that you download.\n\n239\n00:11:26.596 --> 00:11:29.269\nThat file will be an ISO image.\n\n240\n00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:30.596\nAn I-S-O.\n\n241\n00:11:30.596 --> 00:11:33.679\nAnd before the show I went ahead and\ndownloaded one.\n\n242\n00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:36.969\nIt will look something like this here.\n\n243\n00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:41.345\nSo mine says en_windows10_multi\nblah blah blah.\n\n244\n00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:44.304\nIt's actually a longer file name than\nwhat's showing up here on the screen.\n\n245\n00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:48.975\nMultiple addition blah blah blah,\nupdated March 2017.\n\n246\n00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:51.044\nIt's a nice long file name, right?\n\n247\n00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.995\nWhen you download yours, yours might\nhave a completely different file name.\n\n248\n00:11:53.995 --> 00:11:55.384\nThe file name doesn't actually matter.\n\n249\n00:11:55.384 --> 00:12:00.021\nBut basically what it is,\nis an image of an installation DVD.\n\n250\n00:12:00.021 --> 00:12:04.554\nNow they don't sell the DVDs anymore to\nanybody, you can make them if you want.\n\n251\n00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:07.830\nBut most computers don't even\nhave DVD drives on them anymore.\n\n252\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.453\nMy Mac Mini doesn't, my Mac Book doesn't,\nZach yours doesn't I think.\n\n253\n00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:12.036\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n254\n00:12:12.036 --> 00:12:15.662\n&gt;&gt; You don't have that much, so USB keys\nare what we're typically going to use.\n\n255\n00:12:15.662 --> 00:12:17.902\nSo this has to get converted\ninto a USB key, and\n\n256\n00:12:17.902 --> 00:12:20.621\nthe Boot Camp Wizard is gonna do that for\nus, all right?\n\n257\n00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:22.662\nSo this would have been\ndownloaded from Microsoft.\n\n258\n00:12:22.662 --> 00:12:25.735\nEither way, you are also going to\nneed a licence key, all right?\n\n259\n00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:27.330\nNow if you are buy it from Microsoft,\n\n260\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.816\nthey give you the license key\nright there on the website.\n\n261\n00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:33.558\nIf you buy a package store, it will be\ntaped on the inside of that package when\n\n262\n00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:36.319\nyou open it up,\nyou'll have a license key right there.\n\n263\n00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:40.826\nBut you've got to have a license because\nyou're doing an installation of Windows.\n\n264\n00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.138\nYou have to pay for\nthat license, it's not free.\n\n265\n00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.907\nThere's no free version of\nWindows that's available today.\n\n266\n00:12:45.907 --> 00:12:47.224\n&gt;&gt; There are no free rides.\n\n267\n00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:50.118\n&gt;&gt; That's right there's no\nsuch thing as a free lunch.\n\n268\n00:12:50.118 --> 00:12:50.670\n&gt;&gt; That too.\n\n269\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.999\n&gt;&gt; So, I've got that, I've got my key.\n\n270\n00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:57.006\nAnd for this show I'm gonna\nuse a special type of key.\n\n271\n00:12:57.006 --> 00:12:59.606\nThese are called KMS deployment keys.\n\n272\n00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:02.744\nMicrosoft gives these out to enterprises\nto do deployments where it's not\n\n273\n00:13:02.744 --> 00:13:03.253\na real key.\n\n274\n00:13:03.253 --> 00:13:03.996\nIt's a fake key.\n\n275\n00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:05.340\nIn other words, it won't activate.\n\n276\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.129\nSo my version of Windows is going to be\nunactivated, or basically a fake install.\n\n277\n00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:12.515\nIn real life,\nyou need to use your commercial key,\n\n278\n00:13:12.515 --> 00:13:15.523\nthe key that came with your software,\nso that it'll activate.\n\n279\n00:13:15.523 --> 00:13:16.075\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n280\n00:13:16.075 --> 00:13:20.328\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if you follow my\nstep-by-step and you even steal my key,\n\n281\n00:13:20.328 --> 00:13:24.254\njust know that your version of\nWindows won't actually activate.\n\n282\n00:13:24.254 --> 00:13:27.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so honestly, you can run for\n\n283\n00:13:27.257 --> 00:13:28.400\n60 days that way.\n\n284\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.488\nYou get, it's like an eval period.\n\n285\n00:13:30.488 --> 00:13:32.794\nSo if you're just doing this to test out,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n286\n00:13:32.794 --> 00:13:35.882\nYou can try it out, and see if it works,\nor if you just need it short term.\n\n287\n00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:36.875\nYou can get by.\n\n288\n00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:39.440\nBut once you hit that limit,\nif you haven't activated,\n\n289\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.157\nWindows will stop running programs.\n\n290\n00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:41.824\n&gt;&gt; It'll stop, yeah.\n\n291\n00:13:41.824 --> 00:13:43.069\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, that doesn't work out.\n\n292\n00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:44.846\n&gt;&gt; John, I have a question for\nyou as well.\n\n293\n00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:47.719\nSo we can put Windows on a Mac, but\n\n294\n00:13:47.719 --> 00:13:52.247\ncan we put Apple product or\nMac on a Windows product?\n\n295\n00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:55.383\n&gt;&gt; All right, so good question.\n\n296\n00:13:55.383 --> 00:13:56.698\nThe short answer is no.\n\n297\n00:13:56.698 --> 00:13:58.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apple's license,\n\n298\n00:13:58.684 --> 00:14:02.764\nwhen you install MacOS, there's an end\nuser license agreement that comes up.\n\n299\n00:14:02.764 --> 00:14:08.466\nAnd it says this software is only\nlicensed to run on Apple hardware.\n\n300\n00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:08.969\n&gt;&gt; Apple products.\n\n301\n00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:11.075\n&gt;&gt; So you can only run it on\nApple products, not on Windows.\n\n302\n00:14:11.075 --> 00:14:13.323\nNow, that being said, there's a number\nof people who've actually done it.\n\n303\n00:14:13.323 --> 00:14:16.559\nThey've done Mac OS running\non non-Apple hardware.\n\n304\n00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.102\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n305\n00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:20.139\nyou're violating the license agreement,\nso [CROSSTALK]\n\n306\n00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:22.663\n&gt;&gt; Apple doesn't sell macOS by itself.\n\n307\n00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:25.353\nSo you're hearing me telling\nyou guys go in and buy Windows.\n\n308\n00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:26.961\nYou can't just go and buy macOS.\n\n309\n00:14:26.961 --> 00:14:27.554\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n310\n00:14:27.554 --> 00:14:29.174\n&gt;&gt; You buy the hardware,\nand it comes with this set.\n\n311\n00:14:29.174 --> 00:14:30.681\nSo that's why you can't.\n\n312\n00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:33.259\nBut technically it runs\non an intel processor,\n\n313\n00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:37.766\nyou can run it on an intel hardware if\nit wasn't for that whole licensing bit.\n\n314\n00:14:37.766 --> 00:14:38.384\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n315\n00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:39.521\n&gt;&gt; If it wasn't for that whole law part.\n\n316\n00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:41.496\n&gt;&gt; Kinda the legal thing, yeah.\n\n317\n00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:44.708\n&gt;&gt; All right so now we are good\nwith our prerequisites right?\n\n318\n00:14:44.708 --> 00:14:48.382\nBackups done, updates done,\nUSB key, got it.\n\n319\n00:14:48.382 --> 00:14:53.284\nInstallation files got them, now it's time\nfor the actual Boot Camp to begin, right?\n\n320\n00:14:53.284 --> 00:14:58.384\nSo let me just kinda close\nout of this stuff and oops.\n\n321\n00:14:58.384 --> 00:14:59.876\nTiny, there we go.\n\n322\n00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:01.971\nAnd I'm going to launch\nthe Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n323\n00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:05.070\nNow, Boot Camp Assistant is a part Mac OS,\nso if you just hit your Spotlight,\n\n324\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.035\nit'll be right there.\n\n325\n00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:08.543\nIf you wanna browse through it,\nit's in your applications folder,\n\n326\n00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:10.109\ninside another folder called Utilities.\n\n327\n00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:14.761\nSo /application/utilities, and\nyou'll find it the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n328\n00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:18.066\nWhen you run that,\nit's going to launch this wizard, and\n\n329\n00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:22.661\nit's going to start by telling you most\nof the stuff that I just told you, right?\n\n330\n00:15:22.661 --> 00:15:25.219\nLike this first screen is saying,\nhey, we're gonna install and\n\n331\n00:15:25.219 --> 00:15:26.995\nit's really important\nthat you do a backup.\n\n332\n00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:28.435\nOkay, well done, so that's it.\n\n333\n00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:31.085\nSo we'll buy that, all right.\n\n334\n00:15:31.085 --> 00:15:34.655\nThen it's gonna tell us the basic steps\nthat we're gonna go through, right?\n\n335\n00:15:34.655 --> 00:15:36.098\nAnd there's three steps.\n\n336\n00:15:36.098 --> 00:15:39.665\nFirst step is gonna create a Windows\n7 installation disk, right?\n\n337\n00:15:39.665 --> 00:15:42.077\nSo it's gonna make that USB key for me.\n\n338\n00:15:42.077 --> 00:15:47.169\nSecond, it's gonna download the latest\nWindows support software from Apple.\n\n339\n00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:48.201\nI mentioned updates in menu.\n\n340\n00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.291\nThat was updates for the Boot Camp Wizard.\n\n341\n00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:51.796\nIt also has to get drivers.\n\n342\n00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:53.679\nIt pulls them directly from Apple.\n\n343\n00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:56.893\nIt doesn't do those as part of the regular\nupdates because not everybody uses\n\n344\n00:15:56.893 --> 00:15:59.675\nBoot Camp, so it'll be a waste\nof 800 megabytes of disk space.\n\n345\n00:15:59.675 --> 00:16:01.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So they don't wanna do that.\n\n346\n00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.484\nThen lastly install Window 7 or later.\n\n347\n00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:08.844\nNow it says Window 7 or later,\nWindows 7, Windows 8.1, and\n\n348\n00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:11.080\nWindows 10 are all supported.\n\n349\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.767\nWindows 8.0 is not.\n\n350\n00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:16.800\nIt's gonna be 8.1 if you're one of\nthe crazy people that actually used it.\n\n351\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.428\nMost people are doing Windows 7 and\nWindows 10, those are the two.\n\n352\n00:16:19.428 --> 00:16:23.270\nWindows XP is no longer supported so\nwe can't do Windows XP.\n\n353\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.017\nIt's got to be Windows 7 or later.\n\n354\n00:16:26.017 --> 00:16:29.521\nNow I could uncheck that and say I'm\ngonna build the installation media and\n\n355\n00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:30.420\nstop right there.\n\n356\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.035\nThat would be useful if I was\ngonna go to another computer and\n\n357\n00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:34.514\nset up Boot Camp somewhere else.\n\n358\n00:16:34.514 --> 00:16:37.670\nBut I am setting it up on this one, so\nI'm going to leave that checked, okay.\n\n359\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.762\nNow I do want to throw out a quick warning\nhere about a common error that pops up at\n\n360\n00:16:41.762 --> 00:16:42.391\nthis spot.\n\n361\n00:16:42.391 --> 00:16:46.088\nEverything is running smooth for\nme because this is a fresh install but\n\n362\n00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.973\nin the background it actually just did\na check to make sure I met the minimum\n\n363\n00:16:49.973 --> 00:16:53.690\nrequirements, which really just\namounts to looking at disk space.\n\n364\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.341\nSo it said,\ndo I have 40 gigs of disk space available?\n\n365\n00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:59.330\nWell if I look at my Mac.\n\n366\n00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.641\nIf I go up to my Apple menu and\nAbout this Mac.\n\n367\n00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:06.565\nAnd under the About this Mac screen,\nif I go to Storage,\n\n368\n00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:12.090\nI can see I've got a 250 gig drive and\nthat right now I've 228 gigs free.\n\n369\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:16.533\nI've got tons of space for\ndoing a Windows install, right.\n\n370\n00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:19.306\nIt is possible though,\nthat you could get an error saying,\n\n371\n00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:21.910\nyou don't have 40 gigs of free space.\n\n372\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.150\nAnd you come right here to\nthis screen where I'm at and\n\n373\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.608\nyou see where you've got tons\nof disk space, all right.\n\n374\n00:17:28.608 --> 00:17:32.786\nIf you've been using your Mac a while,\nespecially if you're using APFS,\n\n375\n00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:37.316\nthe Apple File System, when you delete\nfiles, it won't actually get deleted.\n\n376\n00:17:37.316 --> 00:17:40.534\nThey just get hidden, and part of\nthat is because of time machine and\n\n377\n00:17:40.534 --> 00:17:42.849\nthen part of that is just\nbecause it's easier for\n\n378\n00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:46.370\nApple to recover them if they were\nhidden as opposed to deleted.\n\n379\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:47.189\nSo they get hidden.\n\n380\n00:17:47.189 --> 00:17:51.520\nAnd what you end up with is what's\ncalled purgeable space, all right?\n\n381\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.265\nAnd you can actually see on mine,\nwell, I guess not.\n\n382\n00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:56.792\nI've got system space.\n\n383\n00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:59.687\nI've got this little bit here,\nthis 5.4 gig container,\n\n384\n00:17:59.687 --> 00:18:02.720\nthat's more than likely\nmy recovery partition.\n\n385\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.916\nBut sometimes you'll see a gray block in\nhere that'll say purgeable space, right?\n\n386\n00:18:06.916 --> 00:18:10.390\nNot always, but sometimes,\nand I'm not seeing it there.\n\n387\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.055\nLet me see if I can find\nit on another screen.\n\n388\n00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:15.767\nIf I pull up my actual computer.\n\n389\n00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:18.966\nThat's my MacBook, in my wrong computer.\n\n390\n00:18:18.966 --> 00:18:24.686\nBut basically what happens with purgeable\nspace is that data is it's gone but\n\n391\n00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:27.861\nit's still occupying space, all right.\n\n392\n00:18:27.861 --> 00:18:34.536\nAnd as long as it's there you might\nactually have less space than you think.\n\n393\n00:18:34.536 --> 00:18:36.345\nAnd the wizard can't cope with that,\nright.\n\n394\n00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:38.600\nSo it really gets upset.\n\n395\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.440\nYeah, is that showing?\n\n396\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.150\nHere I guess I've got a whole\n65 megs of purgeable space.\n\n397\n00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.187\nIt's so\nsmall it wasn't showing up earlier.\n\n398\n00:18:45.187 --> 00:18:48.005\nBut there you guys can kinda\nsee that purgeable space.\n\n399\n00:18:48.005 --> 00:18:48.716\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n400\n00:18:48.716 --> 00:18:52.212\n&gt;&gt; If you run into that problem, right,\nthere's an easy way to fix it but\n\n401\n00:18:52.212 --> 00:18:54.920\nit's a little on the time consuming side.\n\n402\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.902\nWhat you should do is take a time\nmachine backup of your system,\n\n403\n00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:05.740\nboot to recovery, format your hard\ndrive and restore from time machine.\n\n404\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.209\nWhat that does is it puts\nall your files back, but\n\n405\n00:19:08.209 --> 00:19:10.800\nit puts them all at\nthe beginning of the drive.\n\n406\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.478\nAnd so all the empty space\nis at the end of the drive.\n\n407\n00:19:12.478 --> 00:19:14.560\nYou're actually rearranging your files.\n\n408\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.404\nThis happens automatically\nas part of the restore.\n\n409\n00:19:16.404 --> 00:19:18.517\nSo everything's nice and\nneat and in order.\n\n410\n00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:21.660\nAnd then when you launch the Boot Camp\nwizard, it'll run just fine.\n\n411\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.220\nYou won't get any complaints.\n\n412\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.117\nYour free space will actually\nbe free space, all right.\n\n413\n00:19:25.117 --> 00:19:30.120\nBut that error happens more often than not\non Macs that have been used for awhile.\n\n414\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.612\nSo if you've had your Mac for\nsix months, for a couple of years, and\n\n415\n00:19:33.612 --> 00:19:37.717\nyou go to run the Boot Camp installer,\nyou're more likely to see that error than\n\n416\n00:19:37.717 --> 00:19:40.067\nsomebody who just fired\nup a brand-new Mac.\n\n417\n00:19:40.067 --> 00:19:42.768\nOr like me, where mine was\nformatted with a clean install so\n\n418\n00:19:42.768 --> 00:19:44.180\neverything's nice and neat.\n\n419\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.586\nSo I just wanted to point that out cuz\nthat is a really really common type\n\n420\n00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:48.118\nof error.\n\n421\n00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:51.100\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Continue to move forward.\n\n422\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.810\nAnd now it's gonna ask for the ISO image.\n\n423\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.674\nWhere is my Windows installation\ngoing to come from?\n\n424\n00:19:55.674 --> 00:19:58.330\nIf I already had a USB key\nI would've been using that.\n\n425\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:58.877\nI wouldn't need this.\n\n426\n00:19:58.877 --> 00:20:02.860\nBut I don't have a USB key so\nI'm pointing to my ISO image.\n\n427\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.023\nSo I'll browse and find that.\n\n428\n00:20:04.023 --> 00:20:06.320\nI think its tucked away\nin my documents folder.\n\n429\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.054\nSo I'll open that one up.\n\n430\n00:20:09.054 --> 00:20:11.905\nAnd then what disk am I going\nto use to build the installer?\n\n431\n00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:15.110\nSo it sees my little Sandisk USB\nkey that I have plugged in.\n\n432\n00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.481\nAnd it's warning me that it's gonna get\nformatted, and I'm gonna lose my data.\n\n433\n00:20:17.481 --> 00:20:19.350\nSo I'll go ahead hit Continue on that.\n\n434\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.473\nAnd now it's gonna move forward and\n\n435\n00:20:21.473 --> 00:20:24.530\nit's gonna build my\nBoot Camp installation disc.\n\n436\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.530\nNow what's actually\nhappening in the background.\n\n437\n00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.120\nFirst off, it's gonna format the USB key.\n\n438\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.263\nThat doesn't take very long.\n\n439\n00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:35.055\nOnce it's done, it's gonna take that USB\nkey and divide it up into a couple of\n\n440\n00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:39.450\npartitions, one of which will be FAT32 so\nthat Windows can read it.\n\n441\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.495\nWhen that's done it's gonna open up the\nISO image that has my Windows installer.\n\n442\n00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:47.307\nAnd it's gonna extract all the little\nfiles out of it, thousands and\n\n443\n00:20:47.307 --> 00:20:48.500\nthousands of files.\n\n444\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.930\nAnd it's gonna dump them in that\nFAT32 partition, all right?\n\n445\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.960\nSo it's gonna put them all\nright where they need to be.\n\n446\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.888\nWhen that's done it's gonna download\nthe support files from Apple,\n\n447\n00:20:58.888 --> 00:21:00.630\nthat 800 meg support pack.\n\n448\n00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:05.640\nThat has all the hardware drivers for\nthe Apple MacBooks and Mac Mini and so on.\n\n449\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.470\nIt downloads the drivers for\nall of the hardware.\n\n450\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.549\nThey don't actually look at\nwhich model you're running.\n\n451\n00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:15.490\nSo it's gonna download all of that,\nand put that on the USB key as well.\n\n452\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.400\nAnd when that's done, now the USB\nkey will be completely set up for\n\n453\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.660\nus to use for the installation.\n\n454\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.476\nAll that will be left is for\nus to reboot and\n\n455\n00:21:25.476 --> 00:21:30.630\nactually boot from that USB key instead\nof booting from a regular hardware.\n\n456\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.481\nIf we boot from a regular hardware it'll\njust boot right back to MAC OS and\n\n457\n00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:34.010\nthat's it.\n\n458\n00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.810\nBut if we boot from the USB\nkey it'll be ready to install.\n\n459\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.820\nNow I left out one other\nthing that it's going to do.\n\n460\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.820\nIt's gonna take all our hard drive and\nit's gonna divide it up, okay?\n\n461\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.030\nNow, we'll actually see this, is gonna\nask us a question here in a moment.\n\n462\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.775\nAnd it's gonna say all right,\nfrom my example here, it's gonna say,\n\n463\n00:21:52.775 --> 00:21:56.847\nyou got a 250 gig drive, how much space\ndo you wanna set aside for Windows?\n\n464\n00:21:56.847 --> 00:22:01.239\nAnd it'll give me a chance to shrink\nmy Mac partition down to make room for\n\n465\n00:22:01.239 --> 00:22:01.890\nWindows.\n\n466\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.100\nI have to do a minimum of 40 gigabytes.\n\n467\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.463\nThat's the minimum.\n\n468\n00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:11.347\nBut if I want more, I can slide it, and I\ncan assign as much space to it as I want,\n\n469\n00:22:11.347 --> 00:22:13.500\nwell, within limits of my drive.\n\n470\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.530\nI do need to leave room for\nmy existing install.\n\n471\n00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.850\nSo for me,\nmaybe I wanna divide my drive in half.\n\n472\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.177\n125 gigs for Mac OS and\n125 gigs for Windows.\n\n473\n00:22:21.177 --> 00:22:25.046\nOr maybe it's not like that, maybe I\njust need Windows for one program, and\n\n474\n00:22:25.046 --> 00:22:28.750\nI know that 40 gigs of spaces is plenty so\nI just want to leave it at that.\n\n475\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.900\nI'm just going to do the 40 gigs and\nassign that,\n\n476\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.361\nit's up to me to pick, all right.\n\n477\n00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.361\nIt's important to pick correctly\nnow because it's really hard to\n\n478\n00:22:38.361 --> 00:22:40.940\nresize these partitions later on.\n\n479\n00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.516\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n480\n00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:46.197\n&gt;&gt; So if you get it sized right,\nthen you're good for a long time.\n\n481\n00:22:46.197 --> 00:22:49.290\nBut if you get it wrong\nhere's the problem.\n\n482\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:53.580\nTime machine backups,\nthey only backup the Mac partitions,\n\n483\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.820\nthey don't backup the Windows ones.\n\n484\n00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.538\nSo if I decide to change these partitions\nI've got to shrink Windows and\n\n485\n00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:03.693\ngrow MacOS, or\nshrink MacOS and grow Windows.\n\n486\n00:23:03.693 --> 00:23:06.005\nI'm really dealing with two\ndifferent operating systems now and\n\n487\n00:23:06.005 --> 00:23:06.853\nhow they handle files.\n\n488\n00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:11.228\nI'd be better off just formating\nthe machine, redoing the partitions and\n\n489\n00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:13.874\nthen restoring from two different backups.\n\n490\n00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:16.060\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n491\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.610\nIt's hard.\n\n492\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.200\nSo, we want to avoid that if we can.\n\n493\n00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.515\nTry and\nchoose the appropriate amount of space and\n\n494\n00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:23.787\nget it correct on the first\ntry to avoid all that.\n\n495\n00:23:23.787 --> 00:23:26.848\nAll right now, this process to\ncopy my files over to the USB key,\n\n496\n00:23:26.848 --> 00:23:28.340\nit can take a while.\n\n497\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.193\nWe're gonna sit here and\njust kinda let it run.\n\n498\n00:23:30.193 --> 00:23:34.530\nIf you have a USB 3.0 disk,\nthen it usually goes pretty fast.\n\n499\n00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.586\nMine is USB 3, but\nit's still taking a long time.\n\n500\n00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:39.848\nBut we'll let that run.\n\n501\n00:23:39.848 --> 00:23:42.620\nActually, while we're waiting,\nit's copying files, right.\n\n502\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.340\nSo let me bring up the Disk Utility, and\n\n503\n00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.138\nI'll show you that disk\nwhile we're waiting anyway.\n\n504\n00:23:49.138 --> 00:23:50.980\nSo here's my Disk Utility, and\n\n505\n00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.472\nI can see that I've got an external\ndisk called WININSTALL.\n\n506\n00:23:54.472 --> 00:23:55.742\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's my USB key.\n\n507\n00:23:55.742 --> 00:23:59.080\nIt's named it as the Windows\ninstallation key.\n\n508\n00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.353\nAnd if I look at it,\nhere I can see that partition, right?\n\n509\n00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:07.270\nMine's a 16 gig key, and\nit formatted it FAT32 MS-DOS.\n\n510\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.600\nIt's getting it ready to be used for\nWindows.\n\n511\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.100\nAnd it's copying files right now, but\n\n512\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.540\nI can actually browse that disk and\nlook around on it.\n\n513\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.410\nBecause basically what it's doing\nis this making it bootable?\n\n514\n00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:24.070\nSo I see the boot files and efi and\nit's copying the Windows files over,\n\n515\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.860\nthat's the sources folder.\n\n516\n00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.990\nInside the sources,\nhere's where all the Windows files are.\n\n517\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.640\nAnd there's one file in particular\ncalled install.wim, that one?\n\n518\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what actually has the bulk of\n\n519\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.610\nthe Windows installation,\n\n520\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.670\nthat file will be 4 gigs in size,\nI think 3.89 or something.\n\n521\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.080\nSo it's only 1.46 right now,\nso it's still climbing for me.\n\n522\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.240\nBut that's where the bulk of\nthe Windows files will be.\n\n523\n00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.330\nAnd then eventually there will be another\nfolder on here called Support Files, and\n\n524\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.360\nthat's where the Apple\ndrivers will get put in.\n\n525\n00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.590\nIt hasn't downloaded them yet,\nso that file isn't showing up.\n\n526\n00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:58.584\nBut at this point I'm gonna use the magic\nof television to advance us through time\n\n527\n00:24:58.584 --> 00:25:02.267\nand let this installer finish and\nthen we'll pick back up.\n\n528\n00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:07.321\n[MUSIC]\n\n529\n00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:09.750\nAll right,\nwe're gonna move back into regular time.\n\n530\n00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.630\nWe're dropping out of warp.\n\n531\n00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.790\nIf you're watching the fast forward\nreally closely you might have noticed\n\n532\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.740\nhalfway through I had\nto click on something.\n\n533\n00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.475\nMy connection to the internet\ngot interrupted.\n\n534\n00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:20.800\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Somehow so I just had to hit retry for\n\n535\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.670\nit to restart the download.\n\n536\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.590\nIt was downloading\nthe spur files from Apple.\n\n537\n00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.980\nThat can happen you just\nre-download no big deal.\n\n538\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.154\nBut basically once it finishes\npreparing the USB key,\n\n539\n00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:32.707\nit's not quite ready\nto get us started yet,\n\n540\n00:25:32.707 --> 00:25:36.847\nso what you're gonna see is this screen\nwhere the Boot Camp Assistant is\n\n541\n00:25:36.847 --> 00:25:40.452\nstarting to ask for\npermissions to modify your disk, right?\n\n542\n00:25:40.452 --> 00:25:42.829\nSo we need to be an administrator here,\nand\n\n543\n00:25:42.829 --> 00:25:46.005\nthat's because it's about to\ndivide our hard drive up.\n\n544\n00:25:47.135 --> 00:25:48.649\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so here's my 250 gig hard drive.\n\n545\n00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:49.208\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n546\n00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:53.251\n&gt;&gt; And it's wanting to slice\nout 40 gigs from the end of my\n\n547\n00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.155\ndisk-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n548\n00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:55.675\n&gt;&gt; To free up for Windows.\n\n549\n00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:59.662\nNow If I want,\nI can take this slider and I can adjust.\n\n550\n00:25:59.662 --> 00:26:01.961\nAnd I can say well,\nI wanna do 64 gigs or whatever.\n\n551\n00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:03.152\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's impressive.\n\n552\n00:26:03.152 --> 00:26:06.242\n&gt;&gt; You can only go so small though,\ncuz you have to leave room for\n\n553\n00:26:06.242 --> 00:26:09.070\nmacOS in your installed programs and\nso on.\n\n554\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.928\nBut you can adjust it however you want or\n\n555\n00:26:10.928 --> 00:26:13.755\nif you wanna go straight up\nequal you got to divide equally.\n\n556\n00:26:13.755 --> 00:26:18.380\nYou can cut it down the middle and now I'm\ngetting basically 125 gigs for each OS.\n\n557\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n558\n00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.337\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna cut Windows\ndown to just 64 gigs or so.\n\n559\n00:26:22.337 --> 00:26:23.380\nSo it can get right on [INAUDIBLE].\n\n560\n00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.760\nThere we go, so\nthat's what I'm gonna set it.\n\n561\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.500\nSo I've got some space available for\nwindows and now it's ready to rock.\n\n562\n00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.990\nIt's got what it needs and\nI can go ahead just to get install.\n\n563\n00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.970\nAnd we're ready to\nactually do the install.\n\n564\n00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:41.940\nNow, up until this point,\nI haven't really changed my Mac at all.\n\n565\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.690\nI'm still running MacOS.\n\n566\n00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.562\nI still have the whole hard drive for\nMacOS, everything is normal.\n\n567\n00:26:47.562 --> 00:26:50.858\nThe only thing I've really changed is that\nUSB key which has been formatted and now,\n\n568\n00:26:50.858 --> 00:26:52.310\nit's got an installation files on.\n\n569\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.840\nIn fact here now that it's done, I know\nwe took a look at this a moment ago, but\n\n570\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.000\nnow that it's done, I can browse in here.\n\n571\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.050\nAnd I can see that sources file\nthat I mentioned earlier, and\n\n572\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:05.020\nnow there's that support folder,\nand that's where it's dropped\n\n573\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.965\nsome of the Apple files that it downloaded\nsome libraries and some other things.\n\n574\n00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:13.544\nThere is also this Win_PE driver\nfolder that has drivers for\n\n575\n00:27:13.544 --> 00:27:15.460\nApple hardware as well.\n\n576\n00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.435\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n577\n00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:19.370\na lot of that has been added to this\nUSB kit to make ready to support your\n\n578\n00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.335\nApple hardware.\n\n579\n00:27:20.335 --> 00:27:21.479\nSo, that changed a lot,\n\n580\n00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:22.966\nthe USB kit changed a lot-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n581\n00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:24.571\n&gt;&gt; But my system is unchanged.\n\n582\n00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:29.542\nThe moment I hit Install here that's\nwhen it partitions my drive, and\n\n583\n00:27:29.542 --> 00:27:33.667\nwe go to reboot to boot into MacOS,\nsorry, into Windows,\n\n584\n00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:36.830\nto actually get Windows installed.\n\n585\n00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.190\nBut looking at the clock, we are coming\non at the end of this episode, so\n\n586\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.375\nwhy don't we do this,\nwe don't we stop here.\n\n587\n00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:46.715\nAnd we'll kind of label part one here\nas getting prepared for Boot Camp and\n\n588\n00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:50.845\nthen part two, we're gonna do\nthe Windows install, get it fired up,\n\n589\n00:27:50.845 --> 00:27:54.840\nmake sure its working and\nsee boot camp in its final form.\n\n590\n00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.430\n&gt;&gt; Aye aye sir, so Boot Camp part two will\nbe coming our way and before we move on,\n\n591\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.090\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n592\n00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Main thing here, as long as you've\ngot a good time machine backup,\n\n593\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.610\nthis is all a pretty safe operation,\nright?\n\n594\n00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.000\nCuz you can always restore.\n\n595\n00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.470\nI mentioned how you could\npotentially lose data.\n\n596\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:14.010\nI've done this literally hundreds of times\nand I've never had that happen, right?\n\n597\n00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.770\nBut it is a possibility have a backup,\nright?\n\n598\n00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.850\nMake sure you have a backup\nthat's available to you and\n\n599\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.660\nthat you've tested that backup so\nthat it

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.136\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:16.530\nwatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.040\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for this\nepisode of Apple Certified Associates.\n\n8\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.240\nThis is bootcamp, part two.\n\n9\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.600\nAnd our drill sergeant,\nonce again, is Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810\nDon, great to see you again,\nsir, let's move on.\n\n11\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.480\n&gt;&gt; Great to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.580\nReady to drop and give me 20 or-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I will.\n\n13\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.464\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You should drop and\ngive me, no-\n\n14\n00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.710\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow,\n\n16\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.830\nwe're kicking back into boot camp.\n\n17\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.250\nAnd if you watched part one, you know\nwe left off where we're all prepared.\n\n18\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.150\nI mean, our USB key's built up,\nour drive is divided.\n\n19\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.570\nWe are ready to get Windows installed.\n\n20\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.440\nSo that's gonna happen\nright here in this episode.\n\n21\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.390\nWe're gonna take the plunge and make\nactual, significant change to our Mac,\n\n22\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360\nto get both operating systems up and\ngoing so that's-\n\n23\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.460\n&gt;&gt; See that's boot camp.\n\n24\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.130\n&gt;&gt; The adventure we've got\nlined up in this episode.\n\n25\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.040\nAll right, so without further ado, let's\ngo ahead and just dive right back in.\n\n26\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.440\nAnd if we take a look at my system,\nyou'll see where I left it, right,\n\n27\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.530\nwhere we had made that decision of\nhow we were gonna divide the disk.\n\n28\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.960\nAnd now we're left with that\nfinal moment of hesitation, like\n\n29\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.180\n&gt;&gt; Wait, before you push the button,\n\n30\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.020\nI have a question for you.\n\n31\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.459\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So how much or how little room for\n\n32\n00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.879\nthe macOS can you leave, I mean-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n33\n00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.790\nI did kinda glanced over that\nreally briefly in the last episode.\n\n34\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.382\nI said you can shrink the drive\nas much as you want, but\n\n35\n00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:26.190\nyou've gotta leave room for macOS.\n\n36\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.470\nWell, if you notice, or maybe not.\n\n37\n00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.810\nLet me see if I jam it\nall the way across here.\n\n38\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.030\nIt will let you go as small as you can to\ncontain the data that's already in there.\n\n39\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n40\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.610\n&gt;&gt; Plus 8 gigs of free space,\nright, which is not a lot, so.\n\n41\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.790\n&gt;&gt; That's where it stops.\n\n42\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.080\n&gt;&gt; It's whatever space\nyou're already consuming.\n\n43\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.240\nSo I must be consuming 35 gigs of space,\nand then it sticks 8 on there.\n\n44\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.410\nSo if you were only consuming,\nlike on a brand new, fresh install,\n\n45\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.770\nmaybe you're only\nconsuming 15 gigs of space,\n\n46\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.240\nthen this number would be\nable to come down to 23 gigs.\n\n47\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that's how it kinda works out.\n\n48\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.520\nThat's too small,\n8 gigs of space is not a lot.\n\n49\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.560\nIf you install, I don't know,\nAdobe Premier or something like that,\n\n50\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590\nthe application alone will\neat up a lot of that space.\n\n51\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.270\nSo you don't wanna go too small.\n\n52\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.990\nBut like I said in the last episode,\nyou wanna make sure you try and\n\n53\n00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.840\nleave an adequate amount of space for\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n54\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.965\nAll right, so I've got mine set,\nI'm ready to take the plunge.\n\n55\n00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.560\nI'm gonna click Install.\n\n56\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.100\nAnd now comes our moment of truth, right?\n\n57\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.890\nSo right down here,\nyou can see Status: Partitioning disk.\n\n58\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.680\nIt's dividing that disk up,\nit's shrinking the macOS partition.\n\n59\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.960\nAnd once it's shrunk,\n\n60\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.740\nthen it's adding in the new Windows\npartition to the end of it.\n\n61\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.120\nAnd once that's done, now it's got\na place where it can install Windows.\n\n62\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.177\nNow quick word of warning,\n\n63\n00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:42.103\nI made my partitions two different sizes,\n185 and 64 gigs.\n\n64\n00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:46.930\nIf you hit Divide Equally,\nthe two partitions look the same.\n\n65\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.820\nAnd when you boot into Windows,\nit does this super annoying thing\n\n66\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.030\nwhere it asks you to format a drive and\nit doesn't really tell you which is which.\n\n67\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.350\nAnd if they're the same size,\nhow do you know which is which?\n\n68\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.390\nThere's a real moment of just-\n&gt;&gt; Very cringe worthy.\n\n69\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.900\n&gt;&gt; Fear,\nam I about to pick the wrong partition?\n\n70\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.130\nAnd it's certainly possible.\n\n71\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.390\nSo I'll show you that when\nwe get to the Windows side.\n\n72\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.890\nBut a little trick that I like to use is,\neven when I hit Divide Equally,\n\n73\n00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.810\nI'll make one partition at least\none gig bigger than the other.\n\n74\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.820\nAnd that way I now exactly which\none is the macOS partition and\n\n75\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.430\nwhich one is the Windows partition.\n\n76\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.389\nIn my case,\nI know the Windows one is 64 gig.\n\n77\n00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.740\nSo I'll be able to look and\nfind that easy enough.\n\n78\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.560\nBut that's something I\nbumped into in real life.\n\n79\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.500\nYou guys might bump into as well when\nyou use that Divide Equally button.\n\n80\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n81\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Now it is taking a little bit\nlonger to do my partitioning,\n\n82\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.270\ntwo reasons why that might happen.\n\n83\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.300\nOne, if your disk has been heavily used,\n\n84\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.775\nyou might have files\nscattered about on it.\n\n85\n00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:43.430\nIt's having to rearrange\na bit to accommodate that.\n\n86\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.250\nTwo, if you have FileVault\nencryption turned on.\n\n87\n00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.600\nResizing an encrypted disk is\nactually a little bit difficult.\n\n88\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.250\nBecause the empty space is encrypted,\nso it looks like it's full space.\n\n89\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.050\nSo it's gotta kinda\nmanipulate around that.\n\n90\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.180\nSo in my case,\nthat's likely what's going on here.\n\n91\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.440\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you have FileVault?\n\n92\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yep, and so\nit can take a little bit longer.\n\n93\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.150\nIf you don't have FileVault,\nthis process normally is pretty fast.\n\n94\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.540\nThere we go, so it's done.\n\n95\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.900\nAnd I'm gonna punch in my\nadministrative password here.\n\n96\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.680\nAnd now my system reboots, okay.\n\n97\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.710\nNow the system's rebooting.\n\n98\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.867\nAnd when it goes to boot back up,\n\n99\n00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:22.340\nyour Mac has already been set\nto boot from the USB key, right?\n\n100\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.720\nIf something goes wrong and you fail to\nboot, like maybe the system doesn't come\n\n101\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.141\nback up-\n&gt;&gt; And there it is.\n\n102\n00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.810\n&gt;&gt; Then you can hit the power button\nwhile holding the Option key, and\n\n103\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.500\nyou'll see the USB key, and\nyou can pick and you can boot from it.\n\n104\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.740\nIn my case though, I didn't need to\nhit the power while I was doing it.\n\n105\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.870\nSo it's rebooting.\n\n106\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.080\nAnd like Zach pointed out, I'm not seeing\nan Apple with a little bar going across.\n\n107\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.330\nI'm seeing the Microsoft Windows logo.\n\n108\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.434\nI'm doing Windows 10.\n\n109\n00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:46.540\nIf you're doing Windows 7,\nthe logo is a little bit different.\n\n110\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.930\nBut the process is the same, right?\n\n111\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.300\nSo it's gonna boot, and it's gonna\ngo into the Microsoft installer.\n\n112\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.820\nAnd the Microsoft installer,\nfor the most part,\n\n113\n00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.470\ndoesn't have to ask us too many questions.\n\n114\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.781\nBecause Apple has already filled in\na lot of the blanks for us, all right?\n\n115\n00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:04.140\nBut it will ask a few things.\n\n116\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.490\nWe're gonna see a licensing screen\nthat we've got to adhere to.\n\n117\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.680\nBut when it boots up,\nif you've ever installed Windows before,\n\n118\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.510\nyou normally get a bunch of questions\nhere where it's asking things like,\n\n119\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.740\nwhich disk do you want it to install.\n\n120\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.050\nAssuming that it's got all\nthe information it needs,\n\n121\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.810\na lot of that will get answered for us.\n\n122\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.620\nAll right, my first screen here\nis asking about my language.\n\n123\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.070\nLet me zoom in on that a bit.\n\n124\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.140\nAll right, so\nit's just asking me to pick the language.\n\n125\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.710\nAnd this is really talking about\nthe language that your keyboard uses,\n\n126\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.670\nas well as what the system\nis going to use.\n\n127\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.320\nSo it's defaulting to English for me,\nwhich is fine, so I'll stick with that.\n\n128\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.960\nAnd now it’s going to ask for\na product key.\n\n129\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.260\nRemember I said that if we want to install\nWindows, we've got to have a product key.\n\n130\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.670\nWe've gotta type it in.\n\n131\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.400\nIf you don’t have one, you can choose\nthat option down at the bottom.\n\n132\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.570\nSee how it says,\nI don’t have a product key?\n\n133\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.770\nAnd if you choose that option,\nit will actually let you do the install.\n\n134\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.492\nBut you're gonna install as an evaluation.\n\n135\n00:05:57.492 --> 00:05:58.440\nAnd the evaluation,\n\n136\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.520\ndepending on how you got your copy of\nWindows, it's usually 60 days, two months.\n\n137\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.592\nAnd so you can run with the eval copy,\nand it will be all right like that.\n\n138\n00:06:07.592 --> 00:06:12.440\nIf you're just doing this to test and\ntry, then you can go that route.\n\n139\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.920\nIf you actually have bought it,\n\n140\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.250\nthen you'll punch in your\nproduct key right there.\n\n141\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.700\nSince I didn't put in a product key,\n\n142\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.130\non the next screen it's gonna ask\nme which edition I'm installing.\n\n143\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.465\nIf I had put in a product key,\n\n144\n00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:24.470\nit would know whether I had\nbought Home edition or Pro.\n\n145\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.260\nI'll do Pro.\n\n146\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.680\nThere's differences there depending\non what you're trying do.\n\n147\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.810\nOne's cheaper, Home is cheaper.\n\n148\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.480\nBut we'll do Pro, and\nwe'll advance forward.\n\n149\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.120\nOn the next screen, it's gonna start\ndoing the end user license agreement.\n\n150\n00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.460\nThe fun stuff the attorneys all love,\nbecause it keeps them employed.\n\n151\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.238\nAnd it's basically just asking me whether\nor not I am allowed to do what I'm doing,\n\n152\n00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:49.365\nand whether Microsoft can sue me or\nif I can sue them.\n\n153\n00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:52.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, now here's the screen I was\n\n154\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.980\nwarning you about, where you could\npotentially choose the wrong disk.\n\n155\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.480\nWhen you look at your disk,\n\n156\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.320\nit's showing your hard drive\ndivided up into partitions.\n\n157\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.470\nAnd I can see Partition 2 here,\nthat's my Apple partition.\n\n158\n00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.940\nAnd then this next one, Partition 3, and\n\n159\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.120\nsee how they've labeled it BOOTCAMP,\nright?\n\n160\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.950\nThat's the big warning thing for\nyou, use this for BOOTCAMP.\n\n161\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.820\nSo if there's two of them\nthat are the same size,\n\n162\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.570\nthat's the indicator that can kinda\nhelp us figure out which one is which.\n\n163\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.250\nIf it's not labeled though,\nsometimes it's not labeled, and\n\n164\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.950\nif it's not, having a slightly different\nsize is a great way to tell them apart.\n\n165\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.226\nI made it's 64 gigs, so\nI can see there's a difference thing.\n\n166\n00:07:26.226 --> 00:07:27.830\nNotice how the numbers don't quite match.\n\n167\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.486\nI chose 64 gig, but it's actually 60.4.\n\n168\n00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:35.322\nAnd the other one was 185,\nI think, and now it's 172.\n\n169\n00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:39.490\nThat's because Windows measures disks\na little differently than macOS does.\n\n170\n00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.400\nThat's the old Unix style measurement.\n\n171\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.720\nBut basically I'm gonna choose this one.\n\n172\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.670\nNow, here is a sticking point\nthat a lot of people bump into.\n\n173\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.790\nWhen I choose that BOOTCAMP partition,\nlook at the warning.\n\n174\n00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.132\nWindows can't be installed on Drive 0,\nPartition 3.\n\n175\n00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:56.130\nWell, it's labeled BOOTCAMP,\nwhy can't I install?\n\n176\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.260\nAnd if I click some other partitions,\nI get the same thing, right?\n\n177\n00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.718\nSo I can't install in any of these,\nit won't let me move forward.\n\n178\n00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:04.322\nWell the reason is,\nApple didn't license the NT file system,\n\n179\n00:08:04.322 --> 00:08:08.360\nthe file system that Windows uses,\nthey didn't license it.\n\n180\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.930\nSo they couldn't format\nthe disk ahead of time,\n\n181\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.260\nit's formatted with the wrong file system.\n\n182\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.630\nAnd so Windows is saying,\nI can't install on that, right?\n\n183\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.580\nSo all you have to do is choose\nthat boot camp partition and\n\n184\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.250\nhit format, and when you choose format,\nWindows will format it for you.\n\n185\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.320\nI'll just say OK to that, and\nit's gonna format it and now,\n\n186\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.380\nsee how the warning went away?\n\n187\n00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Ran away.\n\n188\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.820\n&gt;&gt; And I can install, but,\nthe label went away too and\n\n189\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.320\nhere's where we could\npotentially mix up again.\n\n190\n00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.460\nIf I had two disks that\nwere the same size,\n\n191\n00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.470\nI could lose track of which one was\nboot camp and which one wasn't.\n\n192\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:44.000\nAll right, so I'm gonna choose that one,\nnow I can hit my next button, and\n\n193\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.320\nnow it's ready to do the install.\n\n194\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.420\nNow on a SSD based system, installing\nWindows 7 takes about 20 minutes,\n\n195\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.230\nall right?\n\n196\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.070\nIt'll say some various\ntimes here in a minute,\n\n197\n00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.090\nthey're all lies,\nit usually takes about 20 minutes.\n\n198\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.110\nOn a slower system it could take as long\nas an hour, but in one way or another,\n\n199\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.055\nyou're gonna be twiddling\nyour thumbs here for a bit.\n\n200\n00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:06.610\n&gt;&gt;

Touchpad.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n\n233\n00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:45.242\nI'll go with United States here and I will\ntell it yes if I can click, there we go.\n\n234\n00:10:45.242 --> 00:10:48.760\nThere's little subtle differences in\nWindows that you don't have in a Mac.\n\n235\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.630\nSo for example it's recognising my\ntouch pad, but the acceleration is off.\n\n236\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.280\nIf I move just a little bit the mouse\nactually going pretty far so\n\n237\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.570\nI'm gonna kind of adjust here.\n\n238\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.500\nNow it says gimme like keyboard layout,\nI got a US keyboard so I'll leave that be.\n\n239\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.620\nAnd if I wanna add a second keyboard,\nI can, I don't, so I will skip.\n\n240\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.130\nAnd now, it's gonna go through and\ncomplete a few little clean-up task and\n\n241\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.940\nget ready for Windows.\n\n242\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.850\nNow, Microsoft is very proactive\non security updates these days so\n\n243\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.930\nit's reaching out for updates.\n\n244\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.290\nIt actually found some, so\nit's gonna be applying some updates and\n\n245\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.890\nthen moving through\nthe rest of the installer.\n\n246\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.431\nNow, this process can\nalso take a bit of time.\n\n247\n00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:27.144\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n248\n00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.674\n&gt;&gt; So you may have to wait a little bit,\n\n249\n00:11:28.674 --> 00:11:31.479\neventually it's gonna go to a big\nblack screen it says welcome and\n\n250\n00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.550\ndoes some other things, but\nit'll just take a little while.\n\n251\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.978\nNow while we was moving to this process,\nI wanna point out a few things,\n\n252\n00:11:37.978 --> 00:11:40.568\nnotice the blue box inside\nof the blackboarder here?\n\n253\n00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:41.380\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n254\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.130\n&gt;&gt; The main thing this is showing\nme is that right now the video\n\n255\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.470\ndriver is not loaded.\n\n256\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.160\nSo, it's not actually\nfilling my whole screen.\n\n257\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.710\nAfter it gets through this initial set up,\nwe'll probably to reboot again for\n\n258\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.480\nall of the drivers to load,\nso we'll keep an eye on that.\n\n259\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.240\nIt's asking if I would like to set\nthis computer up for personal use or\n\n260\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.380\nwork use, I'm just gonna go personal.\n\n261\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.210\nThe difference here,\nif you're in a work environment,\n\n262\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.360\nis you might join\na Microsoft Active directory.\n\n263\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.580\nI don't wanna do that, so\nI'll just say I'm a home user.\n\n264\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.250\nYou can always change your mind on this\nlater too, so it doesn't truly matter.\n\n265\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.360\nI shouldn't say it doesn't matter at all,\nbut anyhow.\n\n266\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.560\nNow it's asking if I wanna sign\nin with a Microsoft Account.\n\n267\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.340\nIf you have Microsoft Live ID,\nyou can log in with it.\n\n268\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.670\nIf you're just trying to get some\nprogram to run, and that's it,\n\n269\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.100\nyou don't need a Microsoft Live ID for\nthat.\n\n270\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.470\nHidden way down here at the bottom, let me\nsee if I can zoom in a little bit on that.\n\n271\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.830\nWay down here at the bottom,\n\n272\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.490\nthere's this little link that\nsays offline account, right?\n\n273\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.350\nWhat that means is, I'm not gonna create\na live ID, I'm just gonna use the user\n\n274\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.610\naccount right here inside of Windows,\nand so that's what I'm going to do.\n\n275\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.270\nAnd so\nI will tell it to use the offline account.\n\n276\n00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.250\nAnd it's gonna ask for\nsome basic account information.\n\n277\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.980\nJust like Apple, when you say I don't\nwanna sign in with my Apple ID and\n\n278\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.140\nit asks you a second time,\nthat's what it's doing here.\n\n279\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.530\nAre you sure you don't wanna\nsign in with the Microsoft ID?\n\n280\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.565\nYou could play Xbox and use Bing,\nit'll be great, I'll pass on both.\n\n281\n00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:03.060\n[LAUGH] And say no, all right.\n\n282\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.380\nNow I given my name, if I can remember it.\n\n283\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:13.440\nAnd I need to choose a memorable\npassword which I will do,\n\n284\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.630\nand I will confirm my password, I know,\nthis is just nail biting excitement.\n\n285\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.990\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; It makes me put a password,\n\n286\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.970\nmy password hint is no hint [LAUGH] and\n\n287\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.270\nthen we'll move forward,\nall right, goodness, Cortana.\n\n288\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:27.872\nNo, well pass over Cortana.\n\n289\n00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll pass up Cortana.\n\n290\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.710\n&gt;&gt; And obviously,\nyou will answer these however you see fit.\n\n291\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:38.040\nYou can let Microsoft be privacy\ninvasive and all that stuff.\n\n292\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.420\nI'm just trying to get through\nthe wizard here as quickly as I can but\n\n293\n00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.280\nanswer these as appropriate for you.\n\n294\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.240\nNow it's actually\nfinishing the install and\n\n295\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.320\nit's gonna say we're getting\neverything ready for you.\n\n296\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.990\nThese screens can actually\ntake a few minutes as well.\n\n297\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.520\nThe first time you log in,\nit's gotta build your desktop, build some\n\n298\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.460\nfavorites that are in the web browser\nby default, and a few other things.\n\n299\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.570\nBut in just a moment,\nit's gonna drop to my desktop, and\n\n300\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.050\nyou probably saw it right there.\n\n301\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.930\nSee how the blue is\nfilling the whole screen?\n\n302\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.586\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; And how the screen flickered a bit?\n\n303\n00:14:04.586 --> 00:14:05.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n304\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.775\n&gt;&gt; That's not my machine malfunctioning,\n\n305\n00:14:06.775 --> 00:14:09.270\nit's just loaded the right\nvideo card driver.\n\n306\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.090\nSo there was probably an update for it or\nit just loaded it off the USBP, and\n\n307\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.370\ngot it put in place.\n\n308\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.340\nNow it fills the screen nicely and,\n\n309\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.902\nwe can wait in 16 by 9\nresolution instead of 4 by 3.\n\n310\n00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:25.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So far better waiting experience and\n\n311\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.870\nwe can sit here and wait.\n\n312\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.680\nSo we'll probably have to use our magic\nof television again here to speed\n\n313\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.265\nthis up a bit.\n\n314\n00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:32.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll pick back up as soon as\n\n315\n00:14:32.148 --> 00:14:32.720\nit's done.\n\n316\n00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.713\n[MUSIC]\n\n317\n00:14:37.713 --> 00:14:40.959\nAll right, at the beginning it told\nme that it found an update, so\n\n318\n00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.623\nhere is the update information.\n\n319\n00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:45.776\nSo little unusualized agreement\ntypes stuff here, I'm just gonna\n\n320\n00:14:45.776 --> 00:14:49.094\nclick the update button tab at the bottom\nand it will apply that update,\n\n321\n00:14:49.094 --> 00:14:52.910\nthen on if you are a whole heck to\ntrace some stuff, so it's gonna apply.\n\n322\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.920\nAnd then this process can take\na little bit as it goes through,\n\n323\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.050\ndepending on how big the update is.\n\n324\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.870\nNow, if you're like me,\nmy Windows installation\n\n325\n00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.625\ndisk didn't include what's\ncalled the Fall Creators Update.\n\n326\n00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:05.490\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And the Fall Creators Update\n\n327\n00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.820\nis a pretty big one.\n\n328\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.850\nSo if that's what you're\ntaking this next update phase,\n\n329\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.980\nwho would actually take upwards of an\nhour, if you're pulling out a full update.\n\n330\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.638\nHere I am, I've been just kind\nof jabbering for a moment,\n\n331\n00:15:17.638 --> 00:15:19.061\nwe're still sitting at 0%.\n\n332\n00:15:19.061 --> 00:15:21.961\nIt's gotta go download the update and\napply it and all that, so\n\n333\n00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:23.560\nthat can take a little bit of time.\n\n334\n00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.270\nBut once that's done,\nwe'll be able to keep working.\n\n335\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.950\nYou'll notice a little option\nhidden down at the bottom,\n\n336\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.750\nthis is kind of our trend these days.\n\n337\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.250\nEverything's hidden down at\nthe bottom of the screen.\n\n338\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.470\nIf you look way down here,\n&gt;&gt; Way down there.\n\n339\n00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.638\n&gt;&gt; Whoops,\nwhy am I not able to zoom in on that?\n\n340\n00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:46.850\nIf I [LAUGH] can get my zoom to work,\nthere we go.\n\n341\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.568\nWay down here, this little option, go to\nmy desktop while my PC updates, okay?\n\n342\n00:15:51.568 --> 00:15:57.554\nSo I can sit here and watch this, and sit\nhere and watch, it hasn't moved at all.\n\n343\n00:15:57.554 --> 00:16:00.461\nOr I can click this little hidden tiny\nupdate down here at the bottom, and\n\n344\n00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.616\nthat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n345\n00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:04.625\nBecause that will at least let me\nget in and kind of get started, so\n\n346\n00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.210\nI'm gonna click that, and there we go.\n\n347\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.870\nThe updates are gonna kinda run\nhere in the background, but\n\n348\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.160\nI can now see my Windows desktop.\n\n349\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.590\nAnd the reason I wanted to pull it up\nwas because of this little window that's\n\n350\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.625\nhidden in the background right here.\n\n351\n00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Let me zoom in on that so\n\n352\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.239\nwe can see it, whoop,\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n353\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.080\nI know how to zoom, I promise,\nthere we go, the Boot Camp installer.\n\n354\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.840\nThe Boot Camp installer contains some\nadditional software that will help your\n\n355\n00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.100\nWindows machine understand\nthat it's on a Mac.\n\n356\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.740\nRight now, Windows doesn't\nactually know we're on a Mac,\n\n357\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.430\nit just thinks we're on some\nkind of standard Intel laptop.\n\n358\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.200\nWell, there's things that Apple doesn't\n\n359\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.770\nlet you do that a standard\nIntel laptop would.\n\n360\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.470\nLike the BIOS is controlled and\nsecured, it isn't in a normal computer.\n\n361\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.820\nSo, Windows needs to know that, and\n\n362\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.270\nthis software is kinda that\nfinal step to let it see that.\n\n363\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.503\nIt's also gonna install\na special driver that will\n\n364\n00:16:57.503 --> 00:17:02.098\nlet your Windows machine read from\nthe Mac partition on your hard drive.\n\n365\n00:17:02.098 --> 00:17:04.440\nYou can't do that unless\nyou install this software.\n\n366\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.310\nSo I'm gonna move forward\nwith the installation for\n\n367\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.700\nthis, and\nit's a pretty straightforward thing.\n\n368\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.874\nOne of those where you just kind of agree\nto a license agreement and click Install,\n\n369\n00:17:11.874 --> 00:17:12.545\nand that's it.\n\n370\n00:17:12.545 --> 00:17:15.570\nSo it's going to install and\nget that put in place.\n\n371\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.960\nYour screen might flicker a few\ntimes as it goes through.\n\n372\n00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.485\nIf it didn't already load the video\ndriver, it's gonna load it now and\n\n373\n00:17:21.485 --> 00:17:22.855\nthen get that put in place.\n\n374\n00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:25.900\nAnd so now I've kinda got two\nthings going on at once, right?\n\n375\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.064\nOne, it's installing the Mac drivers,\nand two, it's installing the update.\n\n376\n00:17:30.064 --> 00:17:30.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n377\n00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:34.812\n&gt;&gt; The update is still sitting\nat a blazing 1%, which is just-\n\n378\n00:17:34.812 --> 00:17:36.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:38.230\n&gt;&gt; That's inspiring right there.\n\n380\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.620\nThe Mac driver is slowly installing.\n\n381\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.930\nNow, the Mac driver looks like it's\nstalled, but it's actually gonna sit here,\n\n382\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.710\nand then it'll jump forward really far,\nand then it'll get installed.\n\n383\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.930\nIf it finishes first and wants to reboot,\n\n384\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.225\nI'll probably reboot the machine without\nthis update being done, but we'll see.\n\n385\n00:17:55.225 --> 00:17:57.546\nThat one's at 2%.\n\n386\n00:17:57.546 --> 00:18:01.485\nSo again, I think we'll have to leverage\nour magic of fast forward to get\n\n387\n00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:05.139\nthrough this one, and continue with our-\n&gt;&gt; Our time machine.\n\n388\n00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:06.183\n&gt;&gt; So, patience.\n\n389\n00:18:06.183 --> 00:18:11.187\n[MUSIC]\n\n390\n00:18:11.187 --> 00:18:13.630\nAll right, so the Apple part is done.\n\n391\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.986\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The Windows update is still 4%,\n\n392\n00:18:15.986 --> 00:18:17.522\n[LAUGH] which is awesome.\n\n393\n00:18:17.522 --> 00:18:20.555\nSo I'm gonna interrupt that\nWindows update, don't sweat it.\n\n394\n00:18:20.555 --> 00:18:23.280\nIt'll fix itself the next time you\nboot it, but I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n395\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.385\nfinish this first part.\n\n396\n00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:27.504\nIt's gonna tell me that I need to\nreboot in the world's smallest font.\n\n397\n00:18:27.504 --> 00:18:28.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n398\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.980\nthis is something I can fix once\nwe're actually back up in business.\n\n399\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.597\nBut if you look,\n\n400\n00:18:34.597 --> 00:18:37.081\nit's just saying I need to restart\nto load the last of the drivers.\n\n401\n00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:38.359\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And once it's done,\n\n402\n00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.340\nthen I'm in good shape.\n\n403\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.320\nBut technically at this point,\nI have Windows and macOS running.\n\n404\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.382\nSo when I restart,\nwhich one is it gonna boot to?\n\n405\n00:18:46.382 --> 00:18:47.320\nIs it gonna boot to Windows?\n\n406\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.020\nOr is it gonna boot to macOS?\n\n407\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.660\nWell, it depends.\n\n408\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.230\nIt's a bit of a crap shoot right now.\n\n409\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.460\nIt's actually gonna boot to\nwhichever one you were in last.\n\n410\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.430\nSo I was in Windows last.\n\n411\n00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.340\n&gt;&gt; That's what you'd think, yeah.\n\n412\n00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.640\n&gt;&gt; So if I say yes,\nthen that's what it's gonna do.\n\n413\n00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.062\nBut I wanna show you guys the process of\nhow we pick which one we're actually going\n\n414\n00:19:02.062 --> 00:19:02.676\nto boot into.\n\n415\n00:19:02.676 --> 00:19:06.130\nSo for right now, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust tell it to reboot.\n\n416\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.635\nAnd once that's done, whoop,\nif I get that mouse under control.\n\n417\n00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:10.550\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n418\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.600\nThere's some little tweaks you wanna do,\nright?\n\n419\n00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.870\nSo one tweak is you'll want\nto change the scaling.\n\n420\n00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.510\nMy Mac has a retina display.\n\n421\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.970\nOr maybe yours doesn't, maybe it does,\nbut that may make things really,\n\n422\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.280\nreally small on your screen.\n\n423\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.980\nAnd if it's really small on the screen,\nyou need to bump up the DPI,\n\n424\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.725\nthe dots per inch.\n\n425\n00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And that makes it visible.\n\n426\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.570\nIf I was running macOS,\nit knows to do that.\n\n427\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.950\nBut when you load Windows,\nit doesn't always know to do that, so\n\n428\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.880\nyou might need to increase that font size.\n\n429\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.830\nAnother little tweak you might need\nto make is to adjust the mouse speed.\n\n430\n00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.140\nMine's way too fast.\n\n431\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.760\nSo these are things that we can tweak\ninside of Windows easy enough if we\n\n432\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.910\nknow to do it.\n\n433\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:50.378\nSo, it's rebooted here, I'm gonna get\nlogged back in, and now I'm in Windows.\n\n434\n00:19:50.378 --> 00:19:51.420\n&gt;&gt; Full Windows experience.\n\n435\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.990\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't quite look the way\nthat I want, but it's close.\n\n436\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.862\nSo, here's where we can\nkinda tweak a few things.\n\n437\n00:19:57.862 --> 00:20:01.730\nFirst thing I'm gonna just\nbring up my Start menu here and\n\n438\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.490\ntype Display and\ngo to Change Display Settings.\n\n439\n00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.684\nAnd inside of Change Display Settings,\nyou'll see Scale and Layout.\n\n440\n00:20:10.684 --> 00:20:14.642\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And right now my scale is at 100%,\n\n441\n00:20:14.642 --> 00:20:18.650\nwhich it says, whoops, is recommended.\n\n442\n00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n443\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.290\nI will 100% recommend you change it\nto something else, because right now,\n\n444\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.240\nit is too small.\n\n445\n00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.971\nI can't read the thing.\n\n446\n00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:26.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna bump that up.\n\n447\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.139\nI know a lot of people like 125%.\n\n448\n00:20:29.139 --> 00:20:31.769\nI'm gonna go to 150%, because of the show,\n\n449\n00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:35.010\nbecause I want it to show up well for\nyou guys on camera.\n\n450\n00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.139\nIn real life land,\nI usually do choose 125%.\n\n451\n00:20:38.139 --> 00:20:39.706\nBut I'm gonna choose 150.\n\n452\n00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:42.852\nAnd when I do that,\nlet me zoom back out here.\n\n453\n00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:45.320\nNow I can actually read\nstuff on my screen.\n\n454\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda nice, okay?\n\n455\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.690\nNow, the other thing I wanna show\nyou is down here at the bottom\n\n456\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.700\nright under my head.\n\n457\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.600\nSo if we go full screen on this one,\nI can see my little status tray down here.\n\n458\n00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.300\nAnd in the status tray, there's an icon.\n\n459\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.390\nIt looks like a black diamond, okay?\n\n460\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.860\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That black diamond, and here,\n\n461\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.990\nI'm gonna zoom a little further.\n\n462\n00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.880\nWe're gonna do the [LAUGH].\n\n463\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.980\n&gt;&gt; That's a big zoom.\n\n464\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n465\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.670\nthe zoom technology's a little bit\noutside of my realm of capabilities.\n\n466\n00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.800\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n467\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.940\n&gt;&gt; So, the black diamond down here,\nthat says Boot Camp, right?\n\n468\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.930\nThis is the Apple software,\nit's running in the background.\n\n469\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.780\nAnd if you right-click on it,\nor two finger click on it,\n\n470\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.720\nyou get this little menu right here.\n\n471\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.700\nAnd you got two options\nthat I wanna highlight.\n\n472\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.590\nOne is Restart into OS X.\n\n473\n00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.560\nThey haven't updated it to say macOS after\nthe Sierra update, I don't know why.\n\n474\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.920\nEventually they'll update it, but\nit still says Restart in OS X.\n\n475\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.560\nThe other option though is\nthe Boot Camp Control Panel.\n\n476\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.820\nAnd if you go into the Boot Camp Control\nPanel, then it's going to ask you,\n\n477\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.894\nwell, I guess we've gotta clear this\nadministrative hurdle here first of\n\n478\n00:21:49.894 --> 00:21:50.660\nclicking Yes.\n\n479\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.230\nThen it's gonna ask you\nabout a couple things.\n\n480\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.640\nYou can come in here, and you can tell\nit hey, here's my Boot Camp for Windows,\n\n481\n00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.550\nI wanna restart and\nrestart into Boot Camp.\n\n482\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.200\nIf you had other Windows installs, you\ncould actually pick them and switch over.\n\n483\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.354\nBut you've also got options up here for\n\n484\n00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:10.280\na remote if you have a Mac mini that\nhas a remote, an infrared receiver.\n\n485\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.847\nYou've got a keyboard options.\n\n486\n00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:15.612\nAnd you've got power options in here that\nyou can tweak to modify how your Mac is\n\n487\n00:22:15.612 --> 00:22:19.250\ngoing to work while you're running\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n488\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.190\nSo, some extra little functionality\ntucked away in here as far\n\n489\n00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.840\nas interaction with the hardware.\n\n490\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.830\nThis is all kinda neat stuff,\nand it's easy to overlook,\n\n491\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.090\ncuz that little black diamond just sits\ndown there in the system tray, right?\n\n492\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.800\nNow my mouse is still going crazy,\nso I'm gonna do one more thing.\n\n493\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.230\nI'm gonna bring up my Start menu\nover here, and I'm gonna type,\n\n494\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.510\nwhoops, I'm gonna type mouse.\n\n495\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.430\nAnd there we go, Change your mouse\nsettings, that's what I wanna do.\n\n496\n00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.975\nAnd I'm gonna slow down my mouse.\n\n497\n00:22:45.975 --> 00:22:47.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As we look here,\n\n498\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.660\nI don't actually see the option\nto slow down the mouse.\n\n499\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.220\nIf I go down here to Additional\nmouse options, I bet it'll turn up.\n\n500\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.238\nAnd here we go, the mouse speed,\nright now, it is way too fast.\n\n501\n00:22:58.238 --> 00:23:00.250\nWait, that's the double-click speed,\ndarn it.\n\n502\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.489\nLet me go over to my Pointers.\n\n503\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.270\nI can click, it's really,\nreally a challenge.\n\n504\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.460\nHere we go, Pointer Options &gt; Motion.\n\n505\n00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.169\nSo here under Motion, right now I'm set\nto what looks middle of the road, and\n\n506\n00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:16.219\nit is just too much, so\nI'm gonna drag that down.\n\n507\n00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:20.860\nI don't wanna go completely slow,\nbut that's so much better.\n\n508\n00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.530\nThere we go.\n\n509\n00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.780\nNow my mouse is moving at a normal speed,\nand it's easier for\n\n510\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.940\nme to control where I'm clicking.\n\n511\n00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.966\nSo, little things like that\nare a symptom of retina displays.\n\n512\n00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:32.305\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Apple's retina displays are so sharp,\n\n513\n00:23:32.305 --> 00:23:34.860\nand they have so many pixels in them.\n\n514\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.635\nFor the mouse to move across it, a lot\nof times, it'll over accelerate to move.\n\n515\n00:23:38.635 --> 00:23:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And the font is too small.\n\n516\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.500\nSo those are two things that I almost\nalways adjust to get the screen looking\n\n517\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.760\nright, and get the mouse moving properly.\n\n518\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.951\nOnce those are set, now I'm having\na good Windows experience, okay?\n\n519\n00:23:49.951 --> 00:23:54.640\nNow, I'm in Windows, I can work,\nI'm running Windows on my Mac mini.\n\n520\n00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.280\nI've got that hardware.\n\n521\n00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.394\nI can come here,\nI can browse my computer, my hard drive,\n\n522\n00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:01.190\nI see my C drive right there.\n\n523\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.221\nThe USB key is still plugged in.\n\n524\n00:24:03.221 --> 00:24:06.100\nI don't see my Mac partition.\n\n525\n00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.256\nWhy is that?\n\n526\n00:24:08.256 --> 00:24:09.650\nWell, a couple of reasons.\n\n527\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.240\nOne mine is formated APFS, the apple\nfile system, Windows can't read that.\n\n528\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.508\nIf it was formatted\nMac Os extended journal,\n\n529\n00:24:16.508 --> 00:24:20.696\nI would have a read only partition, I'd\nactually be able to see it, APFS I can't.\n\n530\n00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:23.240\nProblem number two, file vault.\n\n531\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.894\nMine's encrypted.\n\n532\n00:24:23.894 --> 00:24:27.166\nIf it's encrypted, Windows can't\nsee it either, and it's gone.\n\n533\n00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:28.565\nSo I'm booted into Windows.\n\n534\n00:24:28.565 --> 00:24:32.752\nI'm running Windows on my Mac Mini,\non that hardware, but\n\n535\n00:24:32.752 --> 00:24:35.949\nI can't see Mac OS, it's a separate world.\n\n536\n00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:41.870\nIf I wanna restart into OS 10, I can use\nmy little diamond in my system tray,\n\n537\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.820\nI can choose to restart into OS 10 option.\n\n538\n00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.680\nIn my case actually Mac OS.\n\n539\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.740\nIt'll reboot into Mac OS,\nand it'll come back up.\n\n540\n00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.600\nInside of Mac OS,\nI can go into my system preferences and\n\n541\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.600\nchoose Startup Disk,\nand I can pick Windows,\n\n542\n00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.820\nor Bootcamp is what it's labeled, and then\nhit restart, and it'll restart that way.\n\n543\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.909\nPersonally I don't normally\ndo it either way though.\n\n544\n00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:04.227\nThe way that I like to do\nit is if you shut down, and\n\n545\n00:25:04.227 --> 00:25:06.831\nboot up while holding the option\nkey on your keyboard,\n\n546\n00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:09.455\nthen you can pick what you're\ngonna boot at that time.\n\n547\n00:25:09.455 --> 00:25:11.423\nThat's another way to easily\npick which OS you're gonna boot.\n\n548\n00:25:11.423 --> 00:25:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n549\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.210\n&gt;&gt; So let me show you that real quick.\n\n550\n00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.950\nI'm gonna shut this down,\nand so we'll shut it down.\n\n551\n00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.610\nThe screen's gonna go black here in\njust a moment, and when that's done,\n\n552\n00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.340\nI'm gonna power it back on while\nholding the option key on my keyboard.\n\n553\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.480\nNow, when you shut Windows down,\n\n554\n00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.710\nif you've not worked with a lot, you might\nsee a screen kinda freeze like this.\n\n555\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.060\nIt looks like it didn't\nactually shut down.\n\n556\n00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.510\nDon't always trust it.\n\n557\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.225\nSometimes you need to look at\nthe power light on your computer.\n\n558\n00:25:39.225 --> 00:25:42.791\nWindows is trying to send a command\nto the hardware to turn it off, and\n\n559\n00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:45.384\nsome Macs play nice with that,\nsome Macs don't.\n\n560\n00:25:45.384 --> 00:25:49.550\nUsually, it will actually turn off,\nand mine has.\n\n561\n00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.570\nThe display just hasn't\nquite caught that message.\n\n562\n00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:56.055\nSo I'm gonna hit the power button, and\nI'm gonna hold the option button on my\n\n563\n00:25:56.055 --> 00:26:00.473\nkeyboard, and when I do that it's gonna\nactually reboot, there we go, and\n\n564\n00:26:00.473 --> 00:26:05.124\nthen it's gonna start the boot process,\nand I'm gonna see the disk selector.\n\n565\n00:26:05.124 --> 00:26:07.581\nI'm holding option on the keyboard-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n566\n00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:13.472\n&gt;&gt; And here's my disk selector,\nand if I look at the options\n\n567\n00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:18.910\nin that screen I can see Windows and\nMacintosh HD.\n\n568\n00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.347\nNow, I'm seeing these two other drives\nover here, I left the USB key plugged in.\n\n569\n00:26:23.347 --> 00:26:27.374\nI forgot all about it, so I'm yank the USB\nkey out, and there they went, right?\n\n570\n00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:29.844\n&gt;&gt; There they go.\n&gt;&gt; So, that was my installation disk.\n\n571\n00:26:29.844 --> 00:26:30.684\nI don't need this anymore.\n\n572\n00:26:30.684 --> 00:26:31.851\nI can set it aside.\n\n573\n00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:33.270\nYou can reuse this key.\n\n574\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.607\nI can take it to other Macs and\ninstall Bootcamp from it,\n\n575\n00:26:36.607 --> 00:26:38.171\nsave a little bit of time.\n\n576\n00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:42.670\nBut now, when I boot up holding option,\nI can pick between these two disks, and\n\n577\n00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.374\nif I pick Macintosh HD,\nI'll boot into MacOS.\n\n578\n00:26:45.374 --> 00:26:47.080\nIf I pick Windows, I'll boot into Windows.\n\n579\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.720\nSo easy enough to do it right here at boot\ntime, just by holding that option key.\n\n580\n00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.810\nNow, I'm gonna boot into Mac OS, cuz I\nwanna show you guys something in there.\n\n581\n00:26:57.092 --> 00:27:01.030\nSo that one is going to reboot,\nand once we go to Mac OS,\n\n582\n00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:05.485\ninside of dist utility I'll see\nthat Windows partition, and\n\n583\n00:27:05.485 --> 00:27:09.358\nthat data is there, right,\nbut Mac OS is still here.\n\n584\n00:27:09.358 --> 00:27:12.460\nI can boot in the Mac OS, I can still\ndo all the things that normally do.\n\n585\n00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.600\nMy computer still works\nthe way that it used to work.\n\n586\n00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.290\nAll right, if I browse into,\nactually let me use the go menu up top.\n\n587\n00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:26.280\nI'm gonna go to,\nlet me do this where I can see.\n\n588\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.180\nHere we go, if I go to computer\nthere we go, I see Macintosh HD, and\n\n589\n00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.880\nI see Bootcamp.\n\n590\n00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.451\nMac OS can read the Windows partition.\n\n591\n00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:38.701\nIt can't write to it, it can read.\n\n592\n00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:42.350\nSo I can get my data, I can see my data,\nbut I can't write to it.\n\n593\n00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.150\nSo that makes it like I can\ntransfer files one way if need be.\n\n594\n00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:50.120\nBut it is there, and\nif I go into my system preferences and\n\n595\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.583\nI go to Startup Disk, the Startup Disk\npreference will determine which OS I'm\n\n596\n00:27:55.583 --> 00:28:00.581\ngonna boot the next time that I reboot,\nall right, and it can see both.\n\n597\n00:28:00.581 --> 00:28:05.568\nMacintosh HD and BOOTCAMP, alright, so\nIf I choose BOOTCAMP as my start up disk,\n\n598\n00:28:05.568 --> 00:28:08.990\nthen every time I reboot,\nit's gonna boot to Windows.\n\n599\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.470\nIf I choose Macintosh HD,\nthen it's gonna boot to Mac OS, so\n\n600\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.180\nhere's where I'm kinda picking.\n\n601\n00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.540\nSo, you can do it this way, if you wanna\nmake it permanent, or you can do what I\n\n602\n00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.110\ndid, which is hold that option key when\nbooting, and you'll just boot into Windows\n\n603\n00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.250\nor boot into Mac OS, whichever\none you pick, and run from there.\n\n604\n00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.690\nSo, now I'm running bootcamp.\n\n605\n00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.160\nIt's installed.\n\n606\n00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.242\nI now have a computer with\na split personality, and\n\n607\n00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:35.772\nI can move back and forth between the two\nOSes just by doing a simple reboot.\n\n608\n00:28:35.772 --> 00:28:36.936\n&gt;&gt; It's absolutely wonderful.\n\n609\n00:28:36.936 --> 00:28:37.745\nGreat information.\n\n610\n00:28:37.745 --> 00:28:39.350\nWell delivered, as usual.\n\n611\n00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.089\nThank you Don, and before we leave,\n\n612\n00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:43.967\nyou have that look in your eye\nyou want to say something else.\n\n613\n00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:44.467\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n614\n00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.410\nOne caveat I wanna throw out,\nin this episode I did Windows 10.\n\n615\n00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:54.610\nLet's say I had done Windows 7 instead,\nand then down the road I decide, you know\n\n616\n00:28:54.610 --> 00:29:00.912\nwhat, I think I wanna upgrade to Windows\n10, and I try to do an in-place upgrade.\n\n617\n00:29:00.912 --> 00:29:04.321\nIn-place upgrades are notoriously bad for\nBootcamp.\n\n618\n00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:08.623\nSo when you install one version of\nWindows, it's okay for it to do updates,\n\n619\n00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:13.330\nlike regular system updates, and stuff\nlike that, but if you're gonna upgrade to\n\n620\n00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:17.566\nthe next major OS when you do that it\ntries to overwrite the boot loader, for\n\n621\n00:29:17.566 --> 00:29:20.230\nthe hard drive, and\nthat can mess with Mac OS.\n\n622\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.240\nYou can actually break Mac OS by doing it.\n\n623\n00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.350\nSo Apple recommends that you don't\ndo operating system upgrades.\n\n624\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.910\nNot updates, you should do updates,\nsecurity updates especially,\n\n625\n00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.560\nbut don't do major upgrades,\nfrom Windows 7 to Windows 10,\n\n626\n00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.770\nor Windows 10 to whatever comes out next,\nWindows 11, who knows.\n\n627\n00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.379\nDon't do major updates like that.\n\n628\n00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:45.286\nIf you're going to do that backup your\ndata, format the Bootcamp petition,\n\n629\n00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:50.204\nrerun the Bootcamp Wizard, and then you\ncan reinstall with a newer version.\n\n630\n00:29:50.204 --> 00:29:52.228\nIn fact, let me touch on that real quick.\n\n631\n00:29:52.228 --> 00:29:57.130\nIf you rerun the Bootcamp Wizard it does\nsomething very different the second time\n\n632\n00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:57.860\nyou run it.\n\n633\n00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:03.540\nSo, like on my Mac here, if I bring it up,\nif I fire up my Bootcamp assistant,\n\n634\n00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.000\nwhen I launch it this time instead\nof offering to install Bootcamp,\n\n635\n00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.410\nlike we did a moment ago,\nit's gonna offer to remove Bootcamp.\n\n636\n00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.066\nSee, Remove Windows 7 or later version.\n\n637\n00:30:16.066 --> 00:30:19.298\nLet's say I'm done with that Windows\nmachine, I dont need it anymore, but\n\n638\n00:30:19.298 --> 00:30:22.295\nI do need 64 gigs of space that I'm\nwasting on that Windows install.\n\n639\n00:30:22.295 --> 00:30:26.114\nI could just remove it, it'll undo it,\nit'll remove the Windows partition,\n\n640\n00:30:26.114 --> 00:30:29.876\nexpand out my Mac OS drive, and now I get\nfull access to the hard drive again just\n\n641\n00:30:29.876 --> 00:30:31.718\nby running that Bootcamp Assistant.\n\n642\n00:30:31.718 --> 00:30:35.022\nSo I could do that to remove Windows 7,\nand I could start the process all over\n\n643\n00:30:35.022 --> 00:30:38.433\nagain and load Windows 10, or remove\nWindows 10 and start the process over\n\n644\n00:30:38.433 --> 00:30:41.193\nagain and load Windows 11, or\nwhatever the next version is.\n\n645\n00:30:41.193 --> 00:30:46.170\nSo that's how they recommend you do it,\nnot doing an in-place upgrade.\n\n646\n00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.052\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, thanks Don and that's Bootcamp\npart 2, make sure you see Bootcamp part 1,\n\n647\n00:30:50.052 --> 00:30:53.208\nand make sure you see everything at\nApple Certified Associate Series.\n\n648\n00:30:53.208 --> 00:30:54.390\nYou'll be so glad that you did.\n\n649\n00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.467\nDon's done a great job of putting all\nkinds of information together for you, and\n\n650\n00:30:57.467 --> 00:31:00.544\nit will help you in the long run, and by\nthe way, you're in the course library and\n\n651\n00:31:00.544 --> 00:31:02.961\nthere are thousands of videos\nthere that will help you as well.\n\n652\n00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:06.001\nCheck them out, and\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n653\n00:31:06.001 --> 00:31:07.674\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n654\n00:31:07.674 --> 00:31:08.598\nThanks for watching.\n\n655\n00:31:08.598 --> 00:31:09.584\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n656\n00:31:09.584 --> 00:31:10.432\n&gt;&gt;
