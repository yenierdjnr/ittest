I am doing fantastic Vonne.\n\n8\n00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:29.780\nHow are you today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.700\nI'm pretty good.\n\n10\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.730\nI'm ready to hear what we're\ngoing to be planning out.\n\n11\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.070\nSomething about guessing numbers and\n\n12\n00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.360\nis this like some of our little things\nthat we've done before with Hangman?\n\n13\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very similar and\n\n14\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.460\nactually the- If you're watching these in\norder then well you've seen the Hangman.\n\n15\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.500\nThis is actually a little less\ncomplicated than the Hangman one, but\n\n16\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.780\nit reinforces similar principles.\n\n17\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.160\nNow as you're starting to program,\n\n18\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.840\nthe real goal is to think\nabout the process, right?\n\n19\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.650\nYou're probably not going to\nbuild a project at the beginning\n\n20\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.950\nthat is mind blowing.\n\n21\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.770\nYou know, like wow that's crazy!\n\n22\n00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.950\nAnd that's perfectly okay.\n\n23\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.000\nYou should look for small successes\nthat you can actually attain, and\n\n24\n00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.020\nbuild your confidence.\n\n25\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.330\nBecause the only way you're gonna be\nable to persevere tour frustration is,\n\n26\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.890\nwell, knowing that you've\nbeen successful prior to.\n\n27\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those small victories\nmake you feel really well.\n\n28\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.810\nIt's like, I only ate two pieces\nof pizza instead of three.\n\n29\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.132\nYes, small victory.\n\n30\n00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:21.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We actually have a hashtag between me\n\n31\n00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.090\nand my friends.\n\n32\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.770\nAnd how we text to each other and\nnot on social media,\n\n33\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.040\nas sv18 that carried over from sv17,\nsmall victory.\n\n34\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.114\n&gt;&gt; Small victories are important,\n\n35\n00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:37.720\nthey're kinda like a little islands in\nthe sea of frustration and sadness.\n\n36\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.380\nThat you sometimes climb upon to make\nyour way to the next island right?\n\n37\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.210\nYou're like I recovered,\nI'm jumping back in, this is a long way.\n\n38\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.810\nBut in order to do that,\nwell you have to have a plan right?\n\n39\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.390\nSo our goal in this episode is a very\nbasic plan, I don't know if this will take\n\n40\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.820\na great deal of time, but I do wanna\nemphasize that having a plan even if your\n\n41\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.080\nplan changes is important because you're\nlike, okay, what do I know, what do I need\n\n42\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.820\nto know, let me draw some pictures, let me\nkinda get an idea of what I'm building.\n\n43\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.050\nIf you do that, it's a lot easier to\njust scribble out before you go, man,\n\n44\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.370\nI'm in trouble now.\n\n45\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.360\nI don't know what any of this is and\n\n46\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.700\nI do all want to emphasize\nthat we're planning and\n\n47\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.250\nin the subsequent episodes you may see me\ndeviate from that, that's perfectly okay.\n\n48\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.200\nThe goal is to have an idea,\nit's not set in stone though.\n\n49\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah at least that way you\nhave somewhat of an idea of\n\n50\n00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.650\nmaybe this is something I need to avoid.\n\n51\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.460\nThis might be a little too complicated,\nbecause like you said you wanna try and\n\n52\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.930\nkeep it short and small,\nand small victory.\n\n53\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.900\nSo let's go ahead and not write a novel.\n\n54\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.530\nLet's just write the intro chapter.\n\n55\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n56\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.080\nAnd, well, speaking of that,\n\n57\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.940\nthe only way you can make\na plan is with lots of crayons.\n\n58\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.760\nBut for us, we're actually gonna use a,\nor colored pencils or markers, whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.670\nPick your poison in that deal.\n\n60\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780\nWe're actually gonna use the iPad, so if\nwe can actually take a look at the iPad,\n\n61\n00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.430\nand we're just gonna use this\nto well draw and scribble, and\n\n62\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.100\nmake a plan that well we very well may\ndeviate from, but that's all right.\n\n63\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.320\nSo what I like to start with is\n\n64\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.270\nwell let me get a quick picture of\nwhat I hope to accomplish right?\n\n65\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.510\nSo guess the number.\n\n66\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.620\nWe're gonna build this in the terminal.\n\n67\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.460\nIt's a kinda command line\ninterface if you will.\n\n68\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.840\nSo I'd like to just do a quick scribble\nof what is that gonna look like.\n\n69\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.065\nSo I'm thinking well here's\nour little terminal window,\n\n70\n00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:38.810\nand what's gonna happen with this\nguess the number to set it up.\n\n71\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.570\nThe computer's randomly\ngonna pick a number, and\n\n72\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.310\nthen you're gonna guess to see if\nyou get it right or not, right?\n\n73\n00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.650\nSo you're like,\nwell that doesn't sound crazy.\n\n74\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.990\nYou've played this with your friends.\n\n75\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.650\nFlip a coin, is it heads or tails?\n\n76\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.590\nWhich one is it, right?\n\n77\n00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.590\nYou've done things like that.\n\n78\n00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.580\n&gt;&gt; I was just having flashbacks\nto like kindergarten and\n\n79\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.980\nfirst grade where we were just\nlike what number am I thinking of?\n\n80\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.582\nAnd then they say your number like no.\n\n81\n00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:04.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not the one I was thinking of.\n\n82\n00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:09.600\n&gt;&gt; I always liked to play the part\nof going pick a number between 1 and\n\n83\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.955\n58, just an odd ending range and\npeople got, hold on a second.\n\n84\n00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:18.530\n&gt;&gt; Full disclosure, I usually pick\nthe one right before the end or,\n\n85\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.835\nthe last prime number it's fun.\n\n86\n00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:20.785\nMath nerd.\n\n87\n00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:26.700\nBut, anyway [LAUGH] we have that and\nso, you don't know what that is, right.\n\n88\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.005\nSo, what I'm thinking is this goes\nsomething like what is your guess?\n\n89\n00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:39.260\nAll right, so just ask What is your guess?\n\n90\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.300\nAnd there's a little prompt.\n\n91\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.280\nAnd it's not gonna be quite that large.\n\n92\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.480\nSo, I just can't write really small.\n\n93\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.850\nSo what is your guess?\n\n94\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.430\nAnd there's a little prompt and\nyou go five.\n\n95\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.400\nAnd then well.\n\n96\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.340\nI'm thinking you either get a,\nlet's go with a green.\n\n97\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.290\nYou got a yay, you won.\n\n98\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.590\nOr you get a boo you got it wrong, and\n\n99\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.890\nthen if you get it wrong,\nwhat do I wanna do?\n\n100\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.670\nI wanna come back and\nask for another guess.\n\n101\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.420\nAnd eventually to make\nthis of any sort of game\n\n102\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.100\nyou're probably gonna have a limitation.\n\n103\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.720\nSo what is our limitation here?\n\n104\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.629\nSo limit The guesses.\n\n105\n00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.110\nSo that's our game that I'm thinking of.\n\n106\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.030\nAnd Vonne, it's funny I had not had these\nflashbacks even planning this thing but\n\n107\n00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.310\nI've definitely done what\nnumber am I thinking of?\n\n108\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.400\nSo, how many times do you give your\nfriends a guess, who knows, right?\n\n109\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.420\nIt's till you win effectively.\n\n110\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if this is the right\nplace to ask this question.\n\n111\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.850\nBut, in my brain maybe I'm jumping ahead\ntoo much but, in like the programming or\n\n112\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.350\nwhatever are you going\nto have it like okay,\n\n113\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.660\nyou're gonna randomly generate a number.\n\n114\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.400\nThe computer is gonna do all of this.\n\n115\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.070\nSo it's gonna know the number.\n\n116\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.020\nIt's gonna have it in its storage and its\nbrain while you're guessing this number.\n\n117\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.110\nAnd are you gonna put a limit on that?\n\n118\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.210\n&gt;&gt; In the sense of it's between one and\n58.\n\n119\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\nActually that's a very important thing\n\n120\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.390\nto think about.\n\n121\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.300\nIf I say guess a number, well,\n\n122\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.520\nthere's actually an infinite number\nof numbers that you could guess.\n\n123\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.320\nBut if I say give me a number\nbetween one and 100,\n\n124\n00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.970\ngive me a whole number between one and\n100.\n\n125\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.290\nNow we can get a little loosey\ngoosey with that terminology,\n\n126\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.190\ntypically when someone asks you to\nguess a number, they're not looking for\n\n127\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.900\none point two three seven eight\nnine two eight four, right.\n\n128\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.330\nBecause, well that's kinda ridiculous.\n\n129\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.160\n&gt;&gt; And then just the limited\nknowledge I have about programming or\n\n130\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.120\neven like Excel or whatever like it's\n&gt;&gt; If you say,\n\n131\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.680\nhey computer, give me a random number!\n\n132\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.940\nLike what you just did right there,\nwhole number is between 1 and a 100.\n\n133\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.480\nSo if you're putting that\nin the coding language for\n\n134\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.320\nthe computer to generate\nyour random number.\n\n135\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.850\nWould you want to tell\nthe user in the guessing like,\n\n136\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.120\nhey, it's got to be between 1 and 100.\n\n137\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.940\n&gt;&gt; And we really should.\n\n138\n00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.850\nNow maybe.\n\n139\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.500\nMaybe.\n\n140\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.170\nWe'll kinda just\n\n141\n00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.860\nthrow it out there to add a little bit of\ndifficulty because this is a simple game.\n\n142\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.100\nMaybe we'll just leave it open to\ninterpretation until someone comes there.\n\n143\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.780\nTo keep it kinda loosey,\nlike guess a number.\n\n144\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.400\nNow, part of that is that's just\nadd some directions, right.\n\n145\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.090\nMake sure the number is\nbetween blah blah blah.\n\n146\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.090\nBut also if you leave ambiguous you could\nthen later on maybe add things like,\n\n147\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.910\nmaybe the difficulty level is between\none and 10, it's between one and a 100,\n\n148\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.940\nit's one and a 1000, so I'm gonna leave\nthat be, but you're absolutely correct.\n\n149\n00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.230\nYou should, you have to pick a limit.\n\n150\n00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.080\nComputers are limit in by nature.\n\n151\n00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.269\n&gt;&gt; You're, we're gonna notice\nlike in the programming language,\n\n152\n00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.137\nthe time of the computer, but\n\n153\n00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:55.428\nwe're leaving it to the gamer to\ntry to figure out what's going on.\n\n154\n00:07:55.428 --> 00:08:00.002\nSo that's the fun in this\ntech based guessing game.\n\n155\n00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:05.099\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and to some extent this is\nhorrible game design if we do that, right?\n\n156\n00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:07.382\nIf you don't know what\nyou're supposed to do,\n\n157\n00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:11.152\nI've played games like this where the\nobject of the puzzle is not super clear,\n\n158\n00:08:11.152 --> 00:08:13.800\nbut to some extent that's\npart of the puzzle, right?\n\n159\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.740\nSo we're going to leave it ambiguous, but\n\n160\n00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.850\nyou have a valid point, which actually\nbrings up an interesting thought.\n\n161\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.280\nAfter I draw a picture I'd like\nto say what do I know, right.\n\n162\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.320\nLet me list all the things\nthat I need to consider and\n\n163\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.970\nthen what do I need to know if anything?\n\n164\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.020\nRight, what is my ultimate goal I\nmean other than building the game.\n\n165\n00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.770\nAnd then after that,\n\n166\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.380\nlet me make sure I know how the user\ninteractions are gonna play out.\n\n167\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.197\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's me jumping ahead a little bit?\n\n168\n00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:43.822\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] It's perfectly okay, Vonne,\n\n169\n00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:45.293\nI completely understand.\n\n170\n00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:48.596\nBut these are great questions, and these\nvery well may be questions that you have.\n\n171\n00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:51.240\nAnd to some extent, been doing this for\n\n172\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.140\na little while,\nsometimes I forget those questions, right?\n\n173\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.240\nSo that's perfectly okay.\n\n174\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.070\nBut let's actually make that\nlist of things that we know or\n\n175\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.090\nkind of already have built\nup in our heads, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.210\nSo if we come back to the iPad, so\nto speak, and well what do we know?\n\n177\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.380\nWhat we know, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.810\nSo we need to take user guesses,\nneed to take use.\n\n179\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.290\nWe need to be able to take guesses, right?\n\n180\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.870\nWithout that, there is no game.\n\n181\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.620\nWe need to generate a random number.\n\n182\n00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:37.940\nNumber from, and\nI'm gonna use some math notation here.\n\n183\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.950\nSo, don't get scared from n to m.\n\n184\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.880\nThat's my range.\n\n185\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.600\nN and M can be any pair of numbers.\n\n186\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.640\nAssuming that n is less than m, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.590\nSo 1 to 100, n would be 1, m would be 100.\n\n188\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.120\nI'm just leaving that very open.\n\n189\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.470\nBut I see out of the corner of my eye,\nVonne gave me this stink eye.\n\n190\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.090\nWhat are you talking about Justin?\n\n191\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.690\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know if there was any reason\nfor the n and the m, could we do a and b?\n\n192\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.680\nThis is just a random like math variable?\n\n193\n00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.350\n&gt;&gt; Yep I picked m and\nn just because of previous experience,\n\n194\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.580\nI have an implicit bias based\non my experience for this.\n\n195\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay that's all I was wondering.\n\n196\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.020\nIn that sense that's not scary,\nwe're just saying from a to b, right.\n\n197\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.090\nI use it all the time.\n\n198\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.340\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n199\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.200\nI bring this up because you\nanswering we should do a range,\n\n200\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.700\nbut we need to generate, we need random\nnumber from that interval, right?\n\n201\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.290\nEvery time the game starts.\n\n202\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.970\nI'm further going to clarify\nthis to say you know what?\n\n203\n00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.290\nFor this first iteration let's just\nkeep it between 1 and 100, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.040\nSo we get a random number from 1 to 100,\nwhat else do we need to know?\n\n205\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.670\nSo we can take a guess,\nwe need random number from 1 to 100.\n\n206\n00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.470\nWell we need to print the results.\n\n207\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:07.450\nAnd we also need, well, this is kind\nof what we know we need, right?\n\n208\n00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.570\nLet's see,\nwe also need to be able to determine.\n\n209\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.020\nCorrectness, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.223\nNow, by determining correctness,\nVonne brought up an interesting point,\n\n211\n00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:26.020\ncomputers by nature,\nwell they're very truthful, right?\n\n212\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.388\nHey is this equal to that, yep.\n\n213\n00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:33.230\nIt's not no silly,\nright it doesn't do anything like that,\n\n214\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.200\nso this is actually easier with\na computer than in grade school.\n\n215\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.460\nSo we're good to go.\n\n216\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.910\nNow that's what we need to know\nin order to build the game, or\n\n217\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.400\nexcuse me what we know.\n\n218\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.360\nOkay, we know we need those things.\n\n219\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.084\nWhat are some other things that\nhave propped up from there?\n\n220\n00:11:51.084 --> 00:11:57.700\nAnd it may be nothing, but it looks like\nVonne has something kind of [SOUND].\n\n221\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.922\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nmy facial expressions are always like.\n\n222\n00:11:59.922 --> 00:12:00.766\nWhat?\n\n223\n00:12:00.766 --> 00:12:03.724\nYeah well,\nwhen we're talking about this, well,\n\n224\n00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.155\nwhat about how many times we have guessed.\n\n225\n00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:09.720\nBecause we said like how many times are we\ngoing to let our friends guess the number.\n\n226\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.468\nDo you get three tries?\n\n227\n00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:12.902\nDo you get five tries?\n\n228\n00:12:12.902 --> 00:12:18.020\nSo we would need to determine\nhow many guesses you get.\n\n229\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.936\nAnd then tracking how many of that.\n\n230\n00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:23.190\n&gt;&gt; Good, all right,\nyou're exactly correct,\n\n231\n00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.200\nand to some extent,\nthis is sometimes difficult for\n\n232\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.640\nme cuz I've already done this plan and\nI know all the things we need.\n\n233\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.310\nSo, I'm leaving some ambiguity there\njust to kinda give you an idea for\n\n234\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.840\nproblem solving.\n\n235\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.915\n&gt;&gt; I was listening to one of your\nepisodes then it comes down the way.\n\n236\n00:12:40.915 --> 00:12:43.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No no, this is absolutely not.\n\n237\n00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.400\nWhen preparing for these,\nI have to go through all these steps.\n\n238\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.830\nSo I'm like yeah.\n\n239\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.890\nWe need to be able to take guesses.\n\n240\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.430\nWe need a random number, right,\nbased on our interactions.\n\n241\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:58.960\nBut at the end here, based on this\npicture, we also have what else, right?\n\n242\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.200\nSo this is what we know effectively.\n\n243\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.520\nWe know we need these things.\n\n244\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.760\nWell, during that process,\nthere are some other decisions to make.\n\n245\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.510\nAnd I actually came up with Vonne, so\nI'm glad that Vonne was here, right?\n\n246\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.280\nWhat is the limit?\n\n247\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.892\nSo what is, the limit?\n\n248\n00:13:17.892 --> 00:13:20.574\n[BLANK-AUDIO] Right.\n\n249\n00:13:20.574 --> 00:13:26.020\nHow many guesses are you limited to,\nand what was your other question like?\n\n250\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Keeping track of how many\ntimes the user has guessed,\n\n251\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.480\nare they on their second,\nthird or fourth guess?\n\n252\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.040\nWe only gave them five,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n253\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Yea.\nSo, how do we track?\n\n254\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.340\nI almost went cursive on us there for\na second.\n\n255\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.050\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say, I'm like, we're\ntalking about old school and grade school.\n\n256\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.290\nI learned how to write in cursive.\n\n257\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.880\n&gt;&gt; How do we track the number of guesses?\n\n258\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.760\nSo that's something else we need to know.\n\n259\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.730\nSome of them, I didn't explain up here.\n\n260\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.640\nWhat is your guess?\n\n261\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.550\nDid I just bring that out on the screen?\n\n262\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:06.150\nVonne, I'll go what am I guessing.\n\n263\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.910\nWhat is the best way,\nhow do we convey the rules?\n\n264\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.405\n&gt;&gt; That with the rule Rules about\nsaying too much because we want to keep\n\n265\n00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:18.255\nthe whole,\nyou need to figure out what the 1-100,\n\n266\n00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:21.995\nwhole numbers instead of decimals,\nnot negative, right?\n\n267\n00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:26.395\nWe can't say all that because then that\nkind of gives up too much of the game.\n\n268\n00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:27.045\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n269\n00:14:27.045 --> 00:14:29.745\nAnd to some extent we'll make the\nassumption, since we're the programmer,\n\n270\n00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:31.180\nthat People would know that, right.\n\n271\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.665\nOne to a hundred.\nWe're gonna leave it ambiguous.\n\n272\n00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:37.890\nBut I can show you some tricks\nif you do know the range,\n\n273\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.540\nthat's why I'm trying to use it,\nbe ambiguous.\n\n274\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.820\n&gt;&gt; This is kinda print planning process.\n\n275\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.773\nBecause you now what happens,\nyou never wanna assume,\n\n276\n00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:50.255\nbecause when you assume,\nthings happen [LAUGH].\n\n277\n00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:55.980\nYeah, sometimes those assumptions can be\nfalse and well then well things go bad.\n\n278\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.620\nSo, what is the limit, how do we track\nthe number of guesses, how do we convey\n\n279\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.830\nthe rules without too much,\nthis is how you do it, always do this?\n\n280\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.950\nI think that's a pretty good overview,\nwe may encounter some other things,\n\n281\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.880\nand this a simple game so this is,\nthere's not too much edge case or\n\n282\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.350\ncraziness that can happen,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n283\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.290\nBut then let's think about this.\n\n284\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.760\nWe did an initial kind of mock up drawing.\n\n285\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.720\nBut what does it look like\nnow if I go to play, right?\n\n286\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.430\nSo here I like drawing pictures.\n\n287\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.740\nSo how do I go about playing?\n\n288\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.810\nSo I start here, right?\n\n289\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:41.060\nAnd well right before\nthis I'm gonna say rules.\n\n290\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.160\nSo I'm thinking rules\nare gonna get printed and\n\n291\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.420\nthen you actually start playing.\n\n292\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.700\nThat's typically how games work.\n\n293\n00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.260\nYou explain the rules\nbefore you play the game.\n\n294\n00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.790\nIt would be a horrible disadvantage.\n\n295\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.771\nIf they're like now that you've played\nthe game, let me tell you the rules.\n\n296\n00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:58.705\nSo, we get this started and then that's\nwhere we get this little prompt for\n\n297\n00:15:58.705 --> 00:15:59.338\nthe guess.\n\n298\n00:15:59.338 --> 00:16:01.714\nI'm not going to write,\nthere will actually be something there.\n\n299\n00:16:01.714 --> 00:16:04.338\nJust a little prompt there for the guess.\n\n300\n00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:07.220\nAnd then you guess five, right?\n\n301\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.130\nNow, this is a more delineated\nversion of this diagram.\n\n302\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.780\nSo once you make a guess,\nright, what's gonna happen?\n\n303\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.281\nWell, let's just note that\nbehind the scenes the random\n\n304\n00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:23.912\nnumber has already been chosen.\n\n305\n00:16:25.392 --> 00:16:31.760\nRight, so it's kind of like in this\ntransition period, has been chosen okay?\n\n306\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.860\nAnd then so\nyou make a guess of five right?\n\n307\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.780\nYou know the rules,\nyou know you have to guess a number,\n\n308\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.170\nthere are two possible outcomes\nyou've either got it or you didn't.\n\n309\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.170\nBut let's go even further than that,\nhere's what I'm thinking right?\n\n310\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.980\nSo if we come up here how do\nwe determine correctness?\n\n311\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:17:00.470\nSo part of that is okay let's see here,\nwell we can be too big wow.\n\n312\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.370\nRight, we can be too small.\n\n313\n00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:10.860\nWe don't want to make it too crazy or\nmake it just right.\n\n314\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.389\nOkay, so these are possible states\nthat you can transition in.\n\n315\n00:17:15.389 --> 00:17:20.189\n&gt;&gt; Are you going to be printing on\nthe screen, your number is too large, or\n\n316\n00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:24.189\nyour number is too small to give\nthat range like the higher or\n\n317\n00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:26.113\nlower game, you know that?\n\n318\n00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:26.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n319\n00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:27.585\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking of\nPrice Is Right right now.\n\n320\n00:17:27.585 --> 00:17:29.364\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n321\n00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:30.133\n&gt;&gt; Hey Bob.\n\n322\n00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.147\n&gt;&gt; What was the last bid?\n\n323\n00:17:31.147 --> 00:17:32.216\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right.\n\n324\n00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:34.979\n&gt;&gt; 4,501.\n\n325\n00:17:34.979 --> 00:17:38.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very similar yes so absolutely correct\n\n326\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.590\ncuz this will give you some idea of where\nto go cuz if you went is it negative one?\n\n327\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.380\nNope It's a negative two.\n\n328\n00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.190\nWhat if it's a thousand?\n\n329\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.890\nRight?\n\n330\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.870\nYou need to give some indication\nof where you need to go.\n\n331\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.240\n&gt;&gt; So in the background you're gonna\ntake user input, you know the number and\n\n332\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.910\ncompare, is this value larger\nthen put out this prompt?\n\n333\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.560\nIf it's smaller put out this prompt.\n\n334\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.360\nIt's kind of like an if then situation,\ncorrect?\n\n335\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.200\n&gt;&gt; You're on it.\n\n336\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.870\nSo, Vonne saying, you go,\nit's too high, right?\n\n337\n00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:18.996\nI got real loud there, so I'm very sorry\nif you had to turn your sets down there.\n\n338\n00:18:18.996 --> 00:18:22.100\nYay, right?\n\n339\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.140\nAnd then this one is too low.\n\n340\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.290\nOkay, so these all kinda happen.\n\n341\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.018\nWhat's interesting, though,\nis when this, what that occurs,\n\n342\n00:18:35.018 --> 00:18:36.692\nthen the game stops, right?\n\n343\n00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:38.538\nWe terminate that kind of flow.\n\n344\n00:18:38.538 --> 00:18:45.370\nBut from here, we go okay, well what do we\nwanna do if you're too high or too low?\n\n345\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.210\nThat is an odd error.\n\n346\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.117\n&gt;&gt; You have a ink to shape on right\nnow as an option, so what that means,\n\n347\n00:18:49.117 --> 00:18:51.530\nthat's why you're making\nperfect squares right now.\n\n348\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know, I wanted the\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:18:52.994 --> 00:18:54.991\n&gt;&gt; Perfect squares but I didn't want like\n\n350\n00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:57.560\nodd check marks and meant, so-\n&gt;&gt; It's a line,\n\n351\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.410\nthat's a shape, that's a-\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n352\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:18:59.935\nknow,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:02.210\n&gt;&gt; But the line's cool,\n\n354\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.149\nit's the weird check marks.\n\n355\n00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:05.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, once we get too high or\n\n356\n00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:08.670\ntoo low, we got, we got our next prompt.\n\n357\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.370\nWhat do I wanna do?\n\n358\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:14.280\nWell, I want to go ok,\nwhat's your next guess.\n\n359\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:21.140\nWell, depending on what it is,\na person's going to guess, right.\n\n360\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.730\nIf you said too low, ideally they\nshould guess something higher.\n\n361\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.140\nIf it's too high,\nideally it should be something lower.\n\n362\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.250\n&gt;&gt; But then you're gonna have\nto reevaluate all over again.\n\n363\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:36.070\nSo it's almost like you're just looping\nthat same process like, high, low,\n\n364\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.370\nor did you guess it.\n\n365\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.925\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly correct, Vonne.\n\n366\n00:19:38.925 --> 00:19:40.030\nIt is gonna be a loop.\n\n367\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.980\nSo I'm just gonna say,\nI had to guess some kind of number here.\n\n368\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.040\nRight?\n\n369\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.260\nWell, we're effectively back to here,\nright?\n\n370\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:56.030\nNow I think initially, we can\nactually just say, what is the limit?\n\n371\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.150\nLet's not worry about that.\n\n372\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.771\nWhat about how do we track\nthe number of guess?\n\n373\n00:19:59.771 --> 00:20:02.680\nWell let's not worry about it initially,\nwe can always come back to that.\n\n374\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.040\n&gt;&gt; You just leave it open ended so\n\n375\n00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.780\nyou could guess 1,000 times\nif you really needed to.\n\n376\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.930\nBut I guess with one with 100\nyou could guess 100 times.\n\n377\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but they don't know that right?\n\n378\n00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So they could go one, two, three, four,\n\n379\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.700\nfive\n&gt;&gt; They can do that.\n\n380\n00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.340\nI doubt they're gonna do that but\nif I leave it open ended like that,\n\n381\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.180\nthen the logic becomes very simple and\nyou're absolutely correct, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n382\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.630\nAnd it goes woop, and\nit comes back to the top.\n\n383\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:30.110\nI'm not gonna reprint the rules but I've\nkind of flowed through with this, right?\n\n384\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.820\nSo if I open this up just a little a bit.\n\n385\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.160\nSo I guess, too high, too low,\nif it's yay it's stop.\n\n386\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.420\nNotice that terminates and\nif I get back to here I guess and\n\n387\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.650\neffectively I come back around.\n\n388\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.360\nThis frame and\nthis frame are the same thing.\n\n389\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.020\nNow doing that,\nthis logic becomes very simple.\n\n390\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.560\nBut now initially this is our game, right?\n\n391\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.540\nThat gives our game logic.\n\n392\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.300\nBut how does this get modified if\nwe limit the number of guesses?\n\n393\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:05.080\nWell over here on the right we could say,\nyou've guessed zero times or\n\n394\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.230\nhere you've guessed one time and\nthen you just kinda keep going, right?\n\n395\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:17.300\nSo this would change, maybe some kind of\nreport and then behind the scenes we'll,\n\n396\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.890\ndo I say too high too low or do,\nokay so once you get to here.\n\n397\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.570\n&gt;&gt; The bottom, I know you're pointing.\n\n398\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n399\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.780\n&gt;&gt; If you don't have a mouse pointer.\n\n400\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.550\nThat's actually following where\nyou were going on the screen.\n\n401\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.090\nI followed you so far, but at that point\nI'm like you meant the bottom box.\n\n402\n00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.390\n&gt;&gt; This bottom box right here.\n\n404\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.235\nDrawing is hard.\n\n405\n00:21:40.235 --> 00:21:41.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n406\n00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.880\nSo once you get back to here, right?\n\n407\n00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.320\nLet's say that you've hit the limit.\n\n408\n00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:50.770\nWell at that point I don't want to\nloop anymore I actually want to go\n\n409\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.650\nloser, right?\n\n410\n00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.860\nLike that, right?\n\n411\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.560\nSo you've lost, so this changes more or\n\n412\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.270\nless our flow at this point,\nbut that's an add on.\n\n413\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.010\nNotice how that's an addition\nto our core logic,\n\n414\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.050\nwe just kinda, just add another branch.\n\n415\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.974\n&gt;&gt; Because the wind is\nalready in that loop.\n\n416\n00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:13.598\nYou really only need to break out of it\nif you're going to do the limiting of\n\n417\n00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:15.314\nthe number of guesses, and\n\n418\n00:22:15.314 --> 00:22:20.355\nthen determining you've hit that number\nof guesses, and now you're a loser.\n\n419\n00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:22.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n420\n00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.390\nBut by looking at this very simplified\nversion, we can make progress.\n\n421\n00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.400\nWe have a small victory.\n\n422\n00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.900\nWe've also, okay, we have that down.\n\n423\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.580\nI know how to approach that.\n\n424\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.400\nWhat do I do if I do want to add these?\n\n425\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.960\nNow I'm not saying go crazy with this,\n\n426\n00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.820\nbut what if I want to keep high score\nrecords or, or anything like that.\n\n427\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.600\nDon't get crazy that,\nthat requires a little bit more but\n\n428\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.290\nif we have the score larger we're\ngonna go, o I can just add that here,\n\n429\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.156\nhere, I see blonde looking at me like\n&gt;&gt; Show them where you're at.\n\n430\n00:22:51.156 --> 00:22:52.230\n&gt;&gt; You got a point.\n\n431\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this doesn't have a mouse\ntracker like any other program.\n\n432\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.620\n&gt;&gt; You just got to add that here right,\nand\n\n433\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.430\nthen, okay I can branch off from there.\n\n434\n00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.779\nBut Vonne, I look at this and\nI this is what I want it to look like.\n\n435\n00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:06.444\nAnd what we know and\nthen you had some questions,\n\n436\n00:23:06.444 --> 00:23:09.028\nthat's some more things to consider.\n\n437\n00:23:09.028 --> 00:23:14.040\nWe address those for\nthe most part right here as\n\n438\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.410\nwell as here, so the rules so\nto speak, we have a plan.\n\n439\n00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.090\nA plan is not set stone, we could deviate.\n\n440\n00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.650\nBut I think we have enough at least to get\nstarted with our respective projects so\n\n441\n00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:31.170\nYou're definitely gonna have to come\nback and see how this well plays out.\n\n442\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.030\n&gt;&gt; All right well I love it\nwhen a plan comes together, and\n\n443\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.550\nit looks like we've got all\nthe pieces to make this happen.\n\n444\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.810\nSo in our next episodes we're\ngonna be actually coding it.\n\n445\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.440\nI'm already thinking of some of\nthe coding that I would probably do, but\n\n446\n00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.380\nthen it would probably\nbe completely wrong.\n\n447\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.101\n[LAUGH] So it's good that you're\ngoing to be guiding us through this.\n\n448\n00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:52.720\nSo looking forward to that but for now\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n449\n00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.320\nSigning off for\nDevProTV I've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n450\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n451\n00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.930\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n",

It is good to see you as well, Zach.\n\n7\n00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.161\nHow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; I am great, I'm very excited about this\n\n8\n00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:35.419\nseries, it sounds fantastic.\n&gt;&gt; Well hopefully, I can deliver on\n\n9\n00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:40.294\nyour excitement, and well we kind of\nmade our plan in the previous episode.\n\n10\n00:00:40.294 --> 00:00:42.710\nAnd now it's time to get\nthings kind of set up.\n\n11\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.268\nSo don't know necessarily\nhow long this is gonna take.\n\n12\n00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:49.601\nBut some things that you may have\nquestions about or I wanna make sure that\n\n13\n00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.667\neverybody's on board here and\njust to make sure things are just so.\n\n14\n00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:57.863\nAll right, so we have our plan,\nkind of our game looks like but\n\n15\n00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:03.127\nbefore we can get anything started its\nalways kind of a this process, right?\n\n16\n00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:07.357\nThis repeatable process to set\nup our structure of our project,\n\n17\n00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:13.270\nmake sure we have everything in line and\nbecause this is such a simplistic project.\n\n18\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.084\nIt probably won't take very much to do so,\nbut\n\n19\n00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:20.920\nI always like to employ some testing,\nget some things just kind of rolling, and\n\n20\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.842\nwe'll be good to go.\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna be working exclusively\n\n21\n00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:27.168\nin Python, is that right, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is all Python, so\n\n22\n00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:30.190\nwe're just doing a little\nmore of the same.\n\n23\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.856\nThere's something that you're gonna\nhave to keep an eye out for me Zach,\n\n24\n00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:33.888\nI'm really bad about this.\n\n25\n00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:36.883\nOf course,\nlooking at Python 3 in particular.\n\n26\n00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:42.110\nSometimes I type Python,\nwhich on my machine is actually Python 2.\n\n27\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.597\nSo we could get a little twisted there.\n&gt;&gt; That's a bit wonky.\n\n28\n00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:47.271\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n29\n00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.385\nthat could end up being some issues.\n\n30\n00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:51.912\nSo you're gonna have to\nlike flick me in the ear or\n\n31\n00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:52.626\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n32\n00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.516\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure of those things.\n\n33\n00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:54.529\n&gt;&gt; We need to avoid shenanagans.\n\n34\n00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:55.635\n&gt;&gt; We do, we do.\n\n35\n00:01:55.635 --> 00:02:00.332\nSo I think there's no better time than\nnow to employ someof the skills that\n\n36\n00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:03.459\nwe've picked up over this course,\nof courses.\n\n37\n00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.636\nThis series of courses-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:07.770\n&gt;&gt; In order to set up our project, right?\n\n39\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.086\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n40\n00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:14.397\nAnd I have a blank desktop,\nteskdop, that is not even a word.\n\n41\n00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:15.514\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say Tesla.\n\n42\n00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:16.930\nI have a blank Tesla.\n\n43\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.287\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would be a totally different\n\n44\n00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:19.892\nshow, Zach.\n\n45\n00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:25.218\nSo beautiful mountain landscape, but\nthere's nothing else here, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:29.649\nSo now, this is gonna be a little bit\ndifferent if you're following along on\n\n47\n00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.043\na different platform.\n\n48\n00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:33.160\nBut I'm going to open up\na terminal environment.\n\n49\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.060\nNow I could do everything I'm about\nto show you, graphical point and\n\n50\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.008\nclick, right?\n\n51\n00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.174\nBut we want to reinforce the skills\nthat we've acquired thus\n\n52\n00:02:41.174 --> 00:02:42.222\nfar.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n53\n00:02:42.222 --> 00:02:43.181\n&gt;&gt; In addition to,\n\n54\n00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:47.090\ndoing things through the terminal\nwill make things faster for you.\n\n55\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.749\nAll right, so I'm going to open\nthe spotlight, that's Cmd+Spacebar, and\n\n56\n00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.830\nI'm gonna type terminal.\n\n57\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.247\nAnd there's my terminal uk?\n\n58\n00:02:56.247 --> 00:03:01.972\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and full screen\nthis and bring up the text size.\n\n59\n00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:07.638\nI swear I set that to be a very\nlarge font size upon open,\n\n60\n00:03:07.638 --> 00:03:11.590\nbut sometimes oversight is a killer.\n\n61\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.700\nSo if I ls, this is where I am,\nI'm in my home directory.\n\n62\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.865\nI wanna put this on a desktop,\nso let's cd into the desktop,\n\n63\n00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.760\nso we're changing\ndirectory into the desktop.\n\n64\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.632\nAnd then what we're gonna be,\njust clearing that out there,\n\n65\n00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:28.573\nwe're gonna be building guess the number,\nvery simple game.\n\n66\n00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:29.474\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n67\n00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:30.164\n&gt;&gt; However,\n\n68\n00:03:30.164 --> 00:03:34.622\nit's important to pick a folder name,\nso it's nothing ambiguous.\n\n69\n00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:39.074\nI've seen people this is test,\ntest one, test a, test a1, and\n\n70\n00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:41.877\nI'm like that's a lot of testing going on.\n\n71\n00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:45.203\nSo I'm just going to mkdir\n\n72\n00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:50.860\nguess-the-number like so.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n73\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, unambiguous, pretty simple.\n\n74\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.147\nAnd if I ever come back to it,\nI'm like ha-ha.\n\n75\n00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:58.020\nSo I'm gonna hop back over\ninto guess the number.\n\n76\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.010\nAnd well we're inside of that folder.\n\n77\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.200\nIf I ls, there's nothing there.\n\n78\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.300\nBut if I think about it, I kind of need\na main Python file, and eventually\n\n79\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.755\nit may end up being a lot of Python files,\nbut for now, it's just a single one.\n\n80\n00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:17.006\nAnd then I like to have a read muse\nto keep things kind of notated for\n\n81\n00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.738\nmyself, all right?\n\n82\n00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:21.323\nAnd if nothing else, for someone else.\n\n83\n00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:23.499\nSo I'm gonna call this, you know what?\n\n84\n00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.170\nLet's call this main.py cuz\nit's the main Python file.\n\n85\n00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.344\nThere's some other things we could\nkinda trick Python into doing here and\n\n86\n00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:36.112\nthen let's create readme.txt like so,\nall right?\n\n87\n00:04:36.112 --> 00:04:40.520\nSo if I ls, those are my two files.\n\n88\n00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.327\nNow I have those kind of created,\nwe're good to go, and\n\n89\n00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:46.922\nyou're like our project set up.\n\n90\n00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:50.883\nI like to think of set up as making\nsure that everything's just so,\n\n91\n00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:54.390\nwe have kind of the very\nbasics squared away.\n\n92\n00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.676\nThis is almost there,\nbut not quite finished.\n\n93\n00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:04.150\nSo if we come over here and\nwe open Visual Studio Code, right?\n\n94\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.857\nSo we're gonna open that, and there we go.\n\n95\n00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:11.870\nSo I'm going to make\nthis full screen as well.\n\n96\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.131\nAnd I'm gonna come over here to File,\nand then Open, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:21.500\nSo I'm gonna Open, and\nit's already on my desktop.\n\n98\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.691\nThere's guess-the-number, and\n\n99\n00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:27.089\nthis may vary a little bit\ndifferently on your platform.\n\n100\n00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:31.688\nSometimes it's open or open folder,\nbut I'm not gonna select any one file,\n\n101\n00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:33.490\nI have the folder selected.\n\n102\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.951\nI'm gonna click Open, and there we go.\n\n103\n00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:41.493\nSo it's now open over here on the left.\n\n104\n00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:45.530\nSo I have the folder here, and\nthen I have the two respective files.\n\n105\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.878\nNow before I forget, I'm just going to\nmake it a notation of what did we do?\n\n106\n00:05:52.878 --> 00:05:56.519\nWell, I need to increase that font size,\n\n107\n00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:01.008\nI'm kinda zooming, but\nwe'll go with it for now.\n\n108\n00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:02.345\nSo what did we do?\n\n109\n00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:07.627\nWell what is today, Zach?\n&gt;&gt; 4/3rd.\n\n110\n00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:10.283\n&gt;&gt; 4/3/2018, it is 2018,\n\n111\n00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:11.601\nI do believe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.989\n&gt;&gt; So setting up the project,\n\n113\n00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:18.088\nthe project structure.\n\n114\n00:06:21.608 --> 00:06:27.844\nAdditionally, made sure to stub out,\n\n115\n00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:39.265\nThe python file structure, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:42.425\nSo let's main.py and\n\n117\n00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:47.420\nreadme.txt, just like that.\n\n118\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.121\nSo there we go, let's rearrange that and\nthat's what we've done in this first part,\n\n119\n00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.534\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n120\n00:06:54.534 --> 00:06:59.174\n&gt;&gt; So this further clarify number 1, so\n\n121\n00:06:59.174 --> 00:07:01.936\nthis is the number 1.\n\n122\n00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:04.970\nThis way if you keep track\nof this over the same day,\n\n123\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.010\nyou're like I did this number 1,\nthis number 2, this number 3.\n\n124\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.367\nAnd we're doing this retroactively,\ntypically,\n\n125\n00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:16.115\nwe would do this at the beginning\nof the respective chunk.\n\n126\n00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:20.050\nThat way, we have kind of a checklist or\nwhat are planning to do, right?\n\n127\n00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.108\nWe need to make sure we\nhave a goal in mind and\n\n128\n00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.975\nyou're not just wrecking your\nhands across the keyboard.\n\n129\n00:07:24.975 --> 00:07:28.653\nSo there's our READ ME,\nand if I hover .main.py,\n\n130\n00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:32.760\nit's funny because you will\nprobably get the same thing.\n\n131\n00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.794\nIt's kinda behind my head here,\nif we could just blow this up full screen,\n\n132\n00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:38.088\nso we can talk about it.\n\n133\n00:07:38.088 --> 00:07:40.630\nUser Studio Code tries to be helpful.\n\n134\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.550\nIt says hey, it's recommended file type.\n\n135\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.270\nDo you wanna install this?\n\n136\n00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.180\nFor now,\nwe're gonna go a little old school here.\n\n137\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.419\nAnd you know you may have\nalready installed this before.\n\n138\n00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:56.922\nIt is perfectly okay, if you have, but\nour editor is pretty helpful, we're\n\n139\n00:07:56.922 --> 00:08:02.610\nnot gonna make it so helpful that maybe it\nleads us to be a little more confident.\n\n140\n00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.180\nOr we make mistakes, because we don't\nunderstand how the editor is trying to be\n\n141\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.334\nhelpful cuz I have had that happen,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:08:08.334 --> 00:08:11.577\nSo one thing I do every time I\nset up a new Python project,\n\n143\n00:08:11.577 --> 00:08:16.420\nespecially if I have something really\nsimple that's in a single file.\n\n144\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.510\nI'm going to set up a function, so\ndef, and I'm just gonna call it game,\n\n145\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.640\nall right?\n\n146\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.608\nYou may have seen this called main, start,\n\n147\n00:08:25.608 --> 00:08:30.445\nbeginning or\npretty much anything you wanna call it.\n\n148\n00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:34.060\nBut you have one function that\nis the entry point to your file.\n\n149\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.719\nIf you leave it as a flat file,\nthen things can get weird.\n\n150\n00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.260\nI recommend always nesting all\nof your logic in a function.\n\n151\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:46.240\nNow, I could do this like so,\nand make sure that it runs.\n\n152\n00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.486\nAnd we're gonna do that, so we're good.\n\n153\n00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:53.457\nAnd I'm gonna clear out and\nI'm gonna say, python3 main.py.\n\n154\n00:08:53.457 --> 00:08:57.820\nAnd notice it runs, it's kind of a no\nnews is good news kind of thing, right?\n\n155\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.800\nIf we come back over here,\nif you do this, this is fine.\n\n156\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.279\nHowever, there are times maybe\nI have other functions in this\n\n157\n00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.043\nfile that I wanna use in another file.\n\n158\n00:09:12.043 --> 00:09:17.793\nNumber one, you should probably think\nabout restructuring if that's the case,\n\n159\n00:09:17.793 --> 00:09:20.554\nbut you probably don't wanna do that.\n\n160\n00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:26.382\nWhat I recommend is always\nsaying if __name__ = __main__,\n\n161\n00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:33.520\nand that means this is the main running\nfile then run the game function, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.410\nAnd I still hit Save As there.\n\n163\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.860\nNow, this will only run if I type Python\nblah, blah, blah in the filename.\n\n164\n00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.010\nNot when I'm importing from this file.\n\n165\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.568\nSo this a nice little, kinda like\na guard or a gateway, so to speak.\n\n166\n00:09:48.568 --> 00:09:55.260\nSo python3 main.py, boom,\nit's good to go, all right?\n\n167\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.083\nNow, all I have here is a pass and\n\n168\n00:09:57.083 --> 00:10:00.200\nthat means I haven't decided\nto write anything here.\n\n169\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.743\nA lot of times people will stop\nright there and go, it's good.\n\n170\n00:10:05.743 --> 00:10:10.070\nI do recommend just in case, we were\nactually talking about the Python 2,\n\n171\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.524\nPython 3 thing.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n172\n00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:13.880\n&gt;&gt; I recommend that,\n\n173\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.981\nwell you take a moment and you just\nhave a little bit of nonsense in here.\n\n174\n00:10:18.981 --> 00:10:20.976\nSo yayyy.\n\n175\n00:10:20.976 --> 00:10:22.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n176\n00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:22.605\nworks.\n\n177\n00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:23.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n178\n00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:28.448\nI always like to have this nice confidence\nboost when I start a project to get Yayyy,\n\n179\n00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:29.080\nIt works.\n\n180\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.861\nCuz it might be the last time it works for\na little while.\n\n181\n00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:33.410\nSo Yayyy, It works.\n\n182\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.737\nSo I'm just flipping my cover,\nyou don't have to use multiple desktops,\n\n183\n00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.908\nthis is to help you see things\na little better, right?\n\n184\n00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:44.160\nSo boom, Yayyy, It works, all right?\n\n185\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.887\nAnd then likewise, just make sure that\nthe things either import or whatever.\n\n186\n00:10:49.887 --> 00:10:52.042\nI'm just going to, let's import math,\n\n187\n00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.820\nwe're not actually going\nto need math here.\n\n188\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.670\nBut let's import math and\nmake sure that it still runs, and\n\n189\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.485\neverything seems to be good to go.\n\n190\n00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:06.830\nWe kind of have our general\nproject set up, right?\n\n191\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.243\nBut I want it to really emphasize\nthe same pattern like a read me,\n\n192\n00:11:12.243 --> 00:11:13.959\nwhat are you doing?\n\n193\n00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:18.200\nMake a main.py, or\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n194\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.521\nAnd then also have a function nested\nthat will be all of your main logic.\n\n195\n00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:27.245\nIf you make sure all of these\nrun before you do anything else,\n\n196\n00:11:27.245 --> 00:11:31.950\nthen it will keep you from kind\nof having a more difficult time.\n\n197\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.676\nAnd I'd like to keep this separate, the\nactual project setup because over time,\n\n198\n00:11:35.676 --> 00:11:37.633\nthis will look more and more complicated.\n\n199\n00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:40.820\nAt this early juncture,\nit's pretty simple.\n\n200\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.337\nBut if you have all of this, then we\nshould be getting ready to go to actually\n\n201\n00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:50.296\nstart building our respective game.\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n202\n00:11:50.296 --> 00:11:53.520\nthat was a pretty quick episode then,\nset up the project.\n\n203\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.955\nAnd I know you have something else to say,\n\n204\n00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:56.262\ncuz I can see it in your eye.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n205\n00:11:56.262 --> 00:12:00.360\nlet's just really focus on these small\nlittle chunks and you're right, Zach.\n\n206\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.573\nIt is a pretty quick episode and\n\n207\n00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:06.666\nthis is to emphasize we think\nabout it in chunks, right?\n\n208\n00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:11.051\nIt's not necessarily always about,\nI spent 30 minutes on this or\n\n209\n00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:12.550\nI spent an hour on this.\n\n210\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.730\nI had a plan, I got that chunk done,\nand now I'm successful.\n\n211\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:23.010\nThose small successes will help you move\nforward instead of becoming frustrated.\n\n212\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.558\nNotice I'm calling this a done point or\na check point because I\n\n213\n00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:30.396\nhaven't written plethora of code\nbefore I ever tested anything.\n\n214\n00:12:30.396 --> 00:12:33.645\nI actually ran my file I think\nfive times in this episode, and\n\n215\n00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:37.260\nthere's not actually\nanything meaningful in it.\n\n216\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.921\nThat way I make sure that I haven't\neverything kind of squared away and\n\n217\n00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:43.837\nas I start to implement logic\nfrom our respective game,\n\n218\n00:12:43.837 --> 00:12:47.208\nI'm not going well that's broke\nthat's weird that's broke.\n\n219\n00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:50.560\nI make sure I know\nthe individual small pieces.\n\n220\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.569\nRemember the small successes will keep you\nmoving forward instead of quitting due to\n\n221\n00:12:54.569 --> 00:12:56.741\nfrustration.\n&gt;&gt; Yayyy, It works.\n\n222\n00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:59.792\nSo applied fundamentals,\nguess the number is a wonderful series,\n\n223\n00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:01.300\nmake sure you see every episode.\n\n224\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.394\nJustin's doing a great job putting\nthat all together for you.\n\n225\n00:13:03.394 --> 00:13:06.963\nAnd you know you're gonna be in the course\nlibrary too, where there's thousands\n\n226\n00:13:06.963 --> 00:13:10.120\nof other videos designed to do\none thing to help you go further.\n\n227\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.924\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about Dev Pro TV,\n\n228\n00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:13.643\nyou know a good Dev Pro\nis always learning.\n\n229\n00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:15.771\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n230\n00:13:15.771 --> 00:13:17.457\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n231\n00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:21.922\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

helping\n\n4\n00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:16.931\nyou learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.370\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with applied fundamentals guess\n\n6\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.400\nthe number.\n\n7\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.640\nAnd right now we're gonna take a guess.\n\n8\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550\nThat's the episode title, Take a Guess.\n\n9\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.950\nAnd who's gonna take a guess with us,\nbut the one and only Justin Dennison.\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.150\nJustin, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.470\n&gt;&gt; It is good to be back, Zack.\n\n12\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.440\nBut hopefully, we're not guessing what\nthe ultimate impetus for this episode is.\n\n13\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200\nI think it's always good\nto give a run-down.\n\n14\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.690\nTitlings hard, Take a Guess?\n\n15\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.400\nAm I supposed to guess\nwhat the episode's about?\n\n16\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.910\nNo, no, no.\n\n17\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.680\nRight, kind of the entire\npoint of guess the number is\n\n18\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.120\nI need to be able to take a guess.\n\n19\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.330\nAs the programmer,\nfrom the user in order to go okay.\n\n20\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.540\nI see what you're doing here.\n\n21\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.230\n&gt;&gt; I like the whole mystery\nthat's involved here.\n\n22\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.860\nI like it.\n\n23\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.260\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm just gonna start\nepisodes like, titling these shows.\n\n24\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230\nTitle one, title two or-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.210\n&gt;&gt; Title just like random character.\n\n26\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.530\nNo, no, adjust and it's not too horribly\ndifficult but part of building a game.\n\n27\n00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.670\nAs we end up in this kind of weired loop.\n\n28\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.770\nSo there is gonna be a little more to it.\n\n29\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.890\nBut if you are used to python you've\nbuilt anything with python before.\n\n30\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.250\nA lot of mechanisms we're\nlooking very similar.\n\n31\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.210\nBut before we actually\nstart writing any code.\n\n32\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.450\nIt's always good to kind of\nflesh out what is your plan for\n\n33\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.380\nthis respective session, all right?\n\n34\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.100\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n35\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.830\nAnd yeah, there's some code on the screen,\nbut that's not where we're going.\n\n36\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.839\nWe're going to the readme.txt here, yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.770\nSo it is through\nthe illusion of television,\n\n38\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.290\nit looks like there\nmight be multiple days.\n\n39\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290\nBut we're gonna break the fourth\nwall here a little bit Zach.\n\n40\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.470\nAnd say it is exactly, well, the same day.\n\n41\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.430\nSo, here we go.\n\n42\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.900\nWe're on coding session number two, right?\n\n43\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.112\nWe took a drink, we got some,\nWindings and milk and now we're back.\n\n44\n00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:08.343\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] I gotta have some.\n\n45\n00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:09.410\n&gt;&gt; And milk.\n\n46\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.965\n&gt;&gt; And milk.\n\n47\n00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't foget it.\n\n48\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.003\nThat's a nice, I don't know I\nthink there was a movie with\n\n49\n00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:20.078\nDiana cleftomaniac [CROSSTALK].\n\n50\n00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:23.510\nBut anyway, that was a fun little woo.\n\n51\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Sidebar.\n&gt;&gt; So what are we gonna do?\n\n52\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.600\nAll right, so we're gonna be\ntaking a guess from the user.\n\n53\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.040\nSo taking a guess from the user.\n\n54\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.770\nNow, [COUGH] what does that entail?\n\n55\n00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.015\nI'm gonna further refine this statement,\nI'm gonna take it away.\n\n56\n00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:42.840\n[COUGH] So take multiple guesses\n\n57\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.928\nFrom the user.\n\n58\n00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:53.200\nAnd well, let's see here,\npart of taking a guess is making sure.\n\n59\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.590\nWe know what kind of guesses are.\n\n60\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.707\nAfter each guess, Then we\n\n61\n00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:05.861\nshould Be able to determine\n\n62\n00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:11.022\nless than, greater than.\n\n63\n00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:18.064\nAnd equal to [INAUDIBLE] conditions for\n\n64\n00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:22.030\nthe guessed number.\n\n65\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.622\nWow, that is not a sentence, Justin.\n\n66\n00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:31.816\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n67\n00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:36.460\ntake multiple guesses from the user until\n\n68\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Some equality or some condition is met.\n\n69\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.180\nAll right.\n\n70\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.320\nSo this is a little ambiguous.\n\n71\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.580\nThis is based on our plan.\n\n72\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.330\nBut sometimes,\n\n73\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.610\nyou have to just build things that\naren't necessarily completely correct.\n\n74\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.220\nJust to get your head\naround the problem space.\n\n75\n00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.330\nNow it's funny I read a lot, I listen\nto and I speak to other programmers.\n\n76\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.400\nAnd part of learning is sometimes\nyou just write throwaway code.\n\n77\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.550\nTo fully understand what\nyou're trying to build, right?\n\n78\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.150\nNow on small things like this,\nmaybe it's not too bad.\n\n79\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.620\nBut maybe if you're just starting out.\n\n80\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.380\nYou're like, I don't really\nknow all the machinations here.\n\n81\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.220\nDon't be afraid to write code\nthat you're fully aware.\n\n82\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.400\nProbably gonna throw away.\n\n83\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.250\nYou have a better understanding of the\nproblem and it sounds really inefficient.\n\n84\n00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.270\nBut in the longterm, if you do that a lot.\n\n85\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.550\nThen you got well wait a minute,\nI already done this before.\n\n86\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.170\nI know I had this toolbox of stuff\nthat I'm just gonna reach in and go.\n\n87\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.260\nThere we go,\nthat is that adjustable wrench I need.\n\n88\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.310\nInstead of going at a hammer,\neverything looks like a nail, right?\n\n89\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.180\nSo don't be afraid to write code\nthat you may have to modify,\n\n90\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.990\nchange, throw away at some point,\nall right.\n\n91\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.620\nSo at this point, this makes sense to me.\n\n92\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.430\nBut Zack, I'm gonna turn it over to you.\n\n93\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.030\nI'm gonna make you shoulder\nthe burden here a little bit.\n\n94\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Do these two points make sense as far\nas what we are trying to accomplish?\n\n95\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.040\n&gt;&gt; They actaully do.\n\n96\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.200\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n97\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.650\nAs long as Zack's on board.\n\n98\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.320\n&gt;&gt; I'm on board.\n\n99\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.930\n&gt;&gt; I think we're good to go.\n\n100\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.180\nNow what that means is we're\ngonna come over here to main.pui.\n\n101\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.970\nAnd well, we're, speaking of routing\ncode we're not going to use,\n\n102\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.830\nwe're going to take that out.\n\n103\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.700\nAnd this print.\n\n104\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.050\nYay, that is perfectly fine.\n\n105\n00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.070\nNow, here's what I'm going to do.\n\n106\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.230\nReady?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n\n107\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.598\n&gt;&gt; So,\nI need to take a guess from the user.\n\n108\n00:05:36.598 --> 00:05:41.480\nI;m going to give a Guess, and\n\n109\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.700\nthat's an input.\n\n110\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.330\nWhat is your guess?\n\n111\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.510\nI'm going to put a /in there,\nthat will give me a new character.\n\n112\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.370\nSo /in- new line character.\n\n113\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.970\nGuess what Zack.\n\n114\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.850\nEpisode's done.\n\n115\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.460\nWe actually took a user's guess.\n\n116\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.060\nI'm joking, I'm joking.\n\n117\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.050\nSo let's see what gets printed out here.\n\n118\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.340\nSo let's print guess, just like this.\n\n119\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.110\nAnd notice I'm already testing.\n\n120\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.230\nI just wrote a single line of code and\nI'm already testing.\n\n121\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.960\nI've watched so many people go.\n\n122\n00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.679\nWell I wrote a hundred lines of code and\nnow I'm testing and it's all broke.\n\n123\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.760\nThat's cool.\n\n124\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.640\nNow you've got 100 lines\nof code to divide.\n\n125\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.200\nWhat about a syntax error and\njust this line of code.\n\n126\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.940\nThis is going to be an easy fix.\n\n127\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.720\nSmall little steps, all right?\n\n128\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.760\nSmall steps.\n\n129\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.930\nSo Python 3 named PUI.\n\n130\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.540\nWhat is your guess?\n\n131\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.810\nZack, I'm going to give you the honor.\n\n132\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.720\nWhat is your guess?\n\n133\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.452\n14 all right 14.\n\n134\n00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:41.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what Zach,\n\n135\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.140\nthat was an oddly long pause there.\n\n136\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.012\nBecause you're like I\ndon't wanna be wrong.\n\n137\n00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:50.670\n[LAUGH] There was no wrong\nanswer at this point.\n\n138\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.130\nBut notice it gives me 14\nback immediately, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.480\nSo you know what, Zach?\n\n140\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.040\nWe're gonna stay with 14 because we\nneed to think about our logic, right?\n\n141\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.160\nWe need to think about our logic here,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.930\nSo what is your guess?\n\n143\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.330\nWell I said over here we need to\nbe able to take multiple guesses.\n\n144\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.900\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n145\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.480\nRight, even though we wrote\nthem in this particular order.\n\n146\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.770\nIt doesn't mean that we have to\nthem in this particular order.\n\n147\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.940\nThis is our ultimate outcome,\nthis is our ultimate goal.\n\n148\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.130\nAll right, so after each guess,\nthen after each guess.\n\n149\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.305\nLet's get rid of this thing.\n\n150\n00:07:27.305 --> 00:07:29.590\n[LAUGH] That doesn't make sense,\n\n151\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.160\nwe should be able to determine less than,\ngreater than.\n\n152\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.980\nAnd equal to conditions for\nthe guess number.\n\n153\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now what that means is I'm\n\n154\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.740\ngonna take in a guess.\n\n155\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.170\nAnd then there's gonna be\nsome other number, right?\n\n156\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.940\nThat we should be able to use, all right?\n\n157\n00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.660\nSo if we come over here.\n\n158\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.240\nI don't know where I'm going now.\n\n159\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:54.250\nLet's say the number 2 guess,\njust like that.\n\n160\n00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.352\nAnd Zach we're gonna stay with 14.\n\n161\n00:07:55.352 --> 00:07:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n162\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.260\n&gt;&gt; All right?\nSo we know that your guess is going to be\n\n163\n00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.110\nthe right one.\n\n164\n00:08:00.152 --> 00:08:02.149\nBut let's see if that actually plays out.\n\n165\n00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:07.383\nSo notice this as a number and\n\n166\n00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:12.618\nif guess equals the number to\n\n167\n00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:19.824\nguess then print, well, yay you win.\n\n168\n00:08:19.824 --> 00:08:22.420\nAll right just like that\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful\n\n169\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.920\n&gt;&gt; So let's see, I just hit up there.\n\n170\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.220\nAll right, so\nsometimes I get a little crazy.\n\n171\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.590\nI just hit UP.\n\n172\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:34.630\nSo we're gonna say 14 and\nthat's kinda odd.\n\n173\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.310\nIs that what you expected, Zach?\n\n174\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.720\n&gt;&gt; No, it isn't.\n\n175\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.690\n&gt;&gt; What did you expect?\n\n176\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.225\n&gt;&gt; I expected, yay!\n\n177\n00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:44.407\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and when we're taking guesses,\n\n178\n00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:47.963\nwhen we're taking input\nfrom the console like this,\n\n179\n00:08:47.963 --> 00:08:52.190\nfrom the terminal environment,\nfrom the standard in right?\n\n180\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.150\nI'm typing and I'm giving input.\n\n181\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.530\nIt actually comes in not as a number,\n\n182\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:02.320\neven if I type numbers and this is\nwhere Python can be a little tricky.\n\n183\n00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.981\nActually all programming languages can\nbe a little tricky with this because if\n\n184\n00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:10.523\nyou're not t thinking about\nhow the data's represented.\n\n185\n00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:13.650\nThen you get weird comparisons sometimes,\nall right?\n\n186\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.722\nAnd here's what I'm gonna\ndo to show you what I mean.\n\n187\n00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.368\nI'm gonna say whoa, capital print.\n\n188\n00:09:19.368 --> 00:09:25.035\nI'm gonna say print the type,\nI apparently like capital numbers.\n\n189\n00:09:25.035 --> 00:09:28.070\nCapital numbers, [LAUGH] capital letters.\n\n190\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.390\nThe number to guess, all right.\n\n191\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:36.240\nAnd then I'm going to print\nthe type of guess, okay?\n\n192\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.740\nJust like that.\n\n193\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.270\nAnd then I'm gonna re-run this.\n\n194\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.408\nWhat is your guess?\n\n195\n00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:43.656\n14, and notice we have an int,\n\n196\n00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:48.187\nthat means it's an integer, it's a number.\n\n197\n00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:53.590\nBut what we type in, right, this is the\ntype of the guess, it's actually a string.\n\n198\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:01.070\nAn integer and a string, maybe they\nhave the same inherent value, right?\n\n199\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:08.840\nEffectively what's happening here\nis we're doing 14 equals 14,\n\n200\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.720\nand it goes, I don't know,\nnot really, they're not the same.\n\n201\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.370\nIt's not doing kind of a loose typing.\n\n202\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.940\nIt's trying to determine,\nare they the same type?\n\n203\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.652\nAre they both strings or both integers?\n\n204\n00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:26.740\nAnd if they are,\ndo they have the same value, all right?\n\n205\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.830\nSo this is a gotcha, so be careful there.\n\n206\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.250\nSo what do I have to do?\n\n207\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.590\nWell, guess_as_number.\n\n208\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.900\nWe want to say, I want the integer\nversion of the guess, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.420\nBecause that's what we're comparing too.\n\n210\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.618\nAnd then I'm gonna change\nthis to guess_as_number and\n\n211\n00:10:50.618 --> 00:10:53.440\nthen the number_to_ guess.\n\n212\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.052\nThis should work, full disclosure,\nthis puts kind of the,\n\n213\n00:10:58.052 --> 00:11:00.330\nthis doesn't have any error handling.\n\n214\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.512\nThis puts all of the requirements\non this respective user.\n\n215\n00:11:04.512 --> 00:11:10.875\nAll right, if Zach types in one cheese,\nthen it's gonna break.\n\n216\n00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:15.785\nAll right soo just so\nwe're clear, it's broke.\n\n217\n00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:18.675\nSo we're assuming that\nthe user plays nice.\n\n218\n00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:21.745\nThis is a bad assumption in the long term,\nbut we're going to go with it for\n\n219\n00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:23.022\nnow, all right?\n\n220\n00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:25.812\nSo if I come over here,\nI'm gonna clear this out.\n\n221\n00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:28.673\nI'm gonna rerun and here we go, 14.\n\n222\n00:11:28.673 --> 00:11:30.772\nYay you win, Zach.\n\n223\n00:11:30.772 --> 00:11:32.042\n&gt;&gt; I am a happy man.\n\n224\n00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:33.702\n&gt;&gt; There we go, see.\n\n225\n00:11:33.702 --> 00:11:36.802\nHe's that's what I expected\nthe first time, but this is a trick.\n\n226\n00:11:36.802 --> 00:11:41.772\nNotice though, think about what I've\nbeen telling you the entire time.\n\n227\n00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:45.640\nI've actually say that you're probably,\nI'm sick of you saying this, Justin.\n\n228\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.800\nBy doing small little steps,\nI saw this initially.\n\n229\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.930\nCan you imagine if you wrote\neverything beginning to end, right?\n\n230\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.950\nYou're like, my game is complete\nbefore you ever ran it.\n\n231\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.660\nAnd now you're like,\nit's not working like I thought it was.\n\n232\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.200\n&gt;&gt; It broke.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n233\n00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.550\nit didn't even break, it wasn't even\nlike oops, stuff is bad, right?\n\n234\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.440\nIt was just not behaving\nlike you intended it to.\n\n235\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.670\nYou had some runtime issues,\nthose are really hard to track down.\n\n236\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.650\nBut because we check often,\nrun often, our service area,\n\n237\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.010\nthe respective amount of code that we\nhad to reason about was very small and\n\n238\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.090\nwas easier to find that issue, right?\n\n239\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.360\nNow full disclosure I set you up,\nI knew this was gonna happen.\n\n240\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.245\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew you knew that.\n\n241\n00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:33.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Zach, it's like you don't trust me.\n\n242\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.330\nI don't know, it might be bad for\nour working relationship.\n\n243\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.670\nBut that's completely okay, but\nnow Zach you've won, right?\n\n244\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n245\n00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.950\n&gt;&gt; All right now what happens\nnow though if I rerun this and\n\n246\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.640\nI say uh-oh 15 We're back to nothing.\n\n247\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.190\nWhat we haven't actually made, should be\nless than, greater than, or equal to.\n\n248\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.120\nOur equal to conditions\nare kind of like we won, right?\n\n249\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.210\nOur equal to is won.\n\n250\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.390\nAll right,\nlet's take it a chunk at a time.\n\n251\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.730\nLet's say I just typed 15,\nthat is actually greater than 14, right?\n\n252\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n253\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:14.926\n&gt;&gt; So if guess_as_number,\nwe always have to use that,\n\n254\n00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:20.026\nis greater than THE_NUMBER_TO_GUESS,\n\n255\n00:13:20.026 --> 00:13:25.829\nthen you know what,\nmaybe we just say, too high.\n\n256\n00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:30.976\nAll right, let's check it out,\nlet's make sure that it works so\n\n257\n00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:38.960\nthere we go, 15 too high all right there\nwe go, okay, okay we're good, we're good.\n\n258\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.388\nAnd then well if we've\ndone greater than we need,\n\n259\n00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:51.250\nif guess as number is less than\nthe number I guess print too low.\n\n260\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.712\nOkay, let's see if it works.\n\n261\n00:13:55.712 --> 00:13:58.169\nThere we go, let's clear it out first.\n\n262\n00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:05.102\nSo here we go and then a number\nless than 14 I'm gonna write 10,\n\n263\n00:14:05.102 --> 00:14:07.490\nwell prints too low.\n\n264\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.100\nWe've actually hit all\nthree of our pieces, right?\n\n265\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.723\nOur second ones.\n\n266\n00:14:12.723 --> 00:14:16.854\nBut I am gonna to take a moment before\nwe address take multiple user guesses.\n\n267\n00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:21.778\nI'm gonna take a moment and\nshow you something that will\n\n268\n00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:26.198\nhappen if you keep it written just so,\nall right.\n\n269\n00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:32.450\nSo I'm gonna look at this and\nsome people will go, well, greater than or\n\n270\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.390\nequal to, less than or\nequal to, that's fine, right?\n\n271\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:45.130\nAnd if we come back and we test these,\npython3 main, what is your guess?\n\n272\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.360\nWell, I'm actually going to say 12.\n\n273\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.729\nOkay, too low, that looks like it's fine.\n\n274\n00:14:49.729 --> 00:14:52.040\nI'm gonna say 16, too high, that's fine.\n\n275\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.405\nWhat if I say 14?\n\n276\n00:14:55.405 --> 00:14:57.813\nHmm, high, too low, yay, you win.\n\n277\n00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.341\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n278\n00:14:59.341 --> 00:15:02.401\n&gt;&gt; So you've gotta be careful,\nespecially if you're comparing numbers or\n\n279\n00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.720\nanything like that.\n\n280\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.840\nIf you have an overlap, and you don't\nstretch your logic quite correctly\n\n281\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.770\nthen things can behave again,\nnot as you've anticipated.\n\n282\n00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.120\nSo, let's fix that, all right?\n\n283\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.573\nNumber one, let's get rid of that.\n\n284\n00:15:19.573 --> 00:15:21.641\nLet's get rid of that.\n\n285\n00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:27.150\nNumber two, if I know that\nthese are mutually exclusive\n\n286\n00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.270\nmaybe it's in my best interest\nto say if is this then do this.\n\n287\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.890\nElse if, this is a case, so\n\n288\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:40.221\nit's not greater than\ncheck this [NOISE] see.\n\n289\n00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:46.730\nThat is less than, if its less than\nthen do this otherwise, right?\n\n290\n00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.730\nWhat is the otherwise?\n\n291\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:52.097\nWell I'm just gonna put an elif here,\nokay?\n\n292\n00:15:52.097 --> 00:15:57.788\nSo this is, we're gonna see this work but\nwe're gonna further refine this.\n\n293\n00:15:57.788 --> 00:16:03.590\nLet's go back and check Fourteen,\nyeah you win, still works.\n\n294\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.390\nLet's do 12, too low.\n\n295\n00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.760\nLet's do 17, too high.\n\n296\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.050\nLooks good.\n\n297\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:16.050\nBut if you see if Lif Lif in your code and\nyou know that all possible\n\n298\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.530\nthings have been covered,\nthat last Lif should just be an L, okay.\n\n299\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.040\nI don't need this.\n\n300\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.630\nIf it's not greater than and it's not\nless than then it has to be equal to.\n\n301\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.570\nIf it's not above and it's not below,\nthen it has to be that thing, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:33.850\nSo I'm gonna take out this\nexplicit comparison and say else.\n\n303\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.870\nSo if the number is greater than\nthe number to guess, too high.\n\n304\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.800\nIf the number is less than\nthe number to guess, too low.\n\n305\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.260\nOtherwise, yay, you won, okay.\n\n306\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:53.400\nSo we're good there, lets make\nsure that everything still works.\n\n307\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.740\nNotice there's a lot of testing all right,\nyay, you win and 17 too high.\n\n308\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.140\nSo we're back to the exact same thing,\nbut we've addressed some\n\n309\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.430\ninherent difficulties that you may\nencounter if you're not careful.\n\n310\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.560\nAll right, so\nat this point looks good, right?\n\n311\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.160\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n312\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.110\nIf we come back to our read me,\nwe've hit this second part.\n\n313\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:24.200\nBut take multiple guesses from the user\nuntil some condition is met, okay.\n\n314\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.570\nSo lets come back over\nhere to our main.py, and\n\n315\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:35.670\na lot of times in games you're just going\nto enter what's called a game loop, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:40.480\nYou're entering an infinite loop\nwhere the game is going, all right,\n\n317\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.250\nI'm waiting for user input,\nI'm waiting for user interaction.\n\n318\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.810\nI'm just I'm hanging out.\n\n319\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.730\nWe technically have that right here.\n\n320\n00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.730\nWhat is your guess?\n\n321\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.330\nWe're just waiting.\n\n322\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.840\nSo while true,\nthis is an easy one in Python.\n\n323\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.840\nJust say while true.\n\n324\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.320\nBoom, I have an infinite loop.\n\n325\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.210\nBe very, very careful.\n\n326\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.040\nYou don't have a blocking thing?\n\n327\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040\nWhat do I mean by blocking?\n\n328\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.660\nYour command line stops until\nyou hit enter at this point.\n\n329\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.770\nIf you don't have this then you\njust entered an infinite loop and\n\n330\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.880\nit goes weeeeeeeeee and it just runs\nas hard as it can run, all right?\n\n331\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.830\nAnd then I'm gonna take all of this and\nhigh light it,\n\n332\n00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.650\nif you're in Visual Studio Code you're\ngonna hit tab and it's gonna tab it over.\n\n333\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.320\nAnd now what's gonna happen is when I run\ngame while true I'm gonna take a guess,\n\n334\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.410\nwe're all good right?\n\n335\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.780\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna make that guess into a number.\n\n336\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.310\nAnd I'm just going to\ntest all of these things.\n\n337\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.890\nSo let's see if we've done that.\n\n338\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.291\nSo boom, what is your guess?\n\n339\n00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.768\n12, too low.\n18, too high.\n\n340\n00:18:41.768 --> 00:18:46.040\n14, yay, you win, but\nit asks me what is my guess again.\n\n341\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.780\nRight and you're like well Dustin you just\nsaid we're gonna be taking out a guess,\n\n342\n00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.630\nwell that's actually most\nof the game logic, right?\n\n343\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.130\nWe're gonna refine this at later stages.\n\n344\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.000\nSo what is your guess?\n\n345\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.640\nWe really should just\nkinda stop at this point.\n\n346\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.847\nRight you should just [SOUND]\nyeah you win you're done.\n\n347\n00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:05.822\n&gt;&gt; It sounds good.\n\n348\n00:19:05.822 --> 00:19:07.354\n&gt;&gt; Right so how do I fix that?\n\n349\n00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:09.236\nWell number one come over here.\n\n350\n00:19:09.236 --> 00:19:10.908\nWe're in an infinite loop.\n\n351\n00:19:10.908 --> 00:19:14.670\nIf you do end up in one of those\ninfinite loops that are a run away.\n\n352\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.458\nControl c keyboard interrupt, stop, broke.\n\n353\n00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:18.992\nNot break your computer.\n\n354\n00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:21.120\nIt just breaks the loop right?\n\n355\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.480\nSo what I'm thinking is right now while\ntrue take input, change it to a number.\n\n356\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.610\nIf it's higher tell them it's too high,\nand then what will happen is it will get\n\n357\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.110\nto the end of this loop and\nit'll take another guess.\n\n358\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.800\nIt's too low,\nit'll do the exact same thing.\n\n359\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.470\nAt the end though if you win right,\n\n360\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.840\nwin you've guessed the number,\nThen what do you wanna do?\n\n361\n00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.910\nI'm gonna break.\n\n362\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.848\nJust wanna break out of the loop, right?\n\n363\n00:19:49.134 --> 00:19:51.064\nVery common pattern, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:55.940\nLet's see here, python3 main, 18.\n\n365\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:02.960\n12, 14, yay, you win and we're done, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.140\nSo that's pretty good, not too bad.\n\n367\n00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.602\nYou know Zach I was thinking\n14 is a pretty good number.\n\n368\n00:20:11.602 --> 00:20:15.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; However, however,\n\n369\n00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.750\nthis game would get really boring\nif it was already 14, right?\n\n370\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.820\n&gt;&gt; How about 42?\n\n371\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.870\n&gt;&gt; It could be 42.\n\n372\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.070\nThat is the meaning of life.\n\n373\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.830\nBut it'd almost be nice if it was\nsomething different each time.\n\n374\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.580\nAnd maybe something\ndifferent between 1 and 100.\n\n375\n00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.590\nOkay.\n\n376\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nWe could implement it ourselves and\n\n377\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.810\ngo, we'll just do stuff, some mathematics.\n\n378\n00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.640\nThat sounds hard.\n\n379\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.600\nInstead, we're gonna lean\non the standard library.\n\n380\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.400\nBecause abstractly,\nwe know what we want to happen.\n\n381\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.309\nWe want a random number\nbetween in some range or\n\n382\n00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:53.825\njust some random number, effectively.\n\n383\n00:20:53.825 --> 00:20:58.721\nSo what I'm gonna do is say,\n\n384\n00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:04.231\nfrom random import, randint.\n\n385\n00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:07.660\nThis is part of python,\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n386\n00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.849\nAnd what randint gives me\nis the ability to say,\n\n387\n00:21:11.849 --> 00:21:16.800\nI want a random integer\nfrom 1 to something else.\n\n388\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.150\nWhat's the upper bound on this?\n\n389\n00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.840\n1 to 100, 1 to 50?\n\n390\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1 to 100.\n&gt;&gt; 1 to 100,\n\n391\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.830\nall right, we're gonna go with Zach.\n\n392\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.760\nZach's making decisions here.\n\n393\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.900\nAll right, now at this point,\nwhen we start the game,\n\n394\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.764\nwe're gonna get a random\nnumber between 1 and 100.\n\n395\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.760\nHm, and this is globally scoped, so\nwe could use this, but you know what?\n\n396\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.110\nI may have been thinking,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n397\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.090\nLet's grab this cuz we only want\nto set this once the game starts.\n\n398\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.730\n&gt;&gt; And this will become\n&gt;&gt; Nice work.\n\n399\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:52.080\nSo, when we start the game, when this\nfunction runs, set the number to guess to\n\n400\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.040\nrandom integer between 1 and 100,\nand then while true, take the guess.\n\n401\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.030\nAnd pretty much that's our game logic,\n\n402\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.830\nbecause if we're taking a guess,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n403\n00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.806\nNow we wanna refine this,\nbut let's see if this works.\n\n404\n00:22:05.806 --> 00:22:10.204\nAnd full disclosure,\nif you're the one building this game,\n\n405\n00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:13.756\nyou wanna know how to exploit it,\nhow to break it.\n\n406\n00:22:13.756 --> 00:22:16.884\nThere's a nice strategy that will crop up,\n\n407\n00:22:16.884 --> 00:22:20.436\nthat will let you kind of\nalways win very quickly.\n\n408\n00:22:20.436 --> 00:22:23.320\nAnd I'll show you that right now.\n\n409\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.220\nright?\nWhat is your guess?\n\n410\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.380\nWell, if you know that the bounds\nare between one and a 100, say 50.\n\n411\n00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.830\nIt's too low, cool.\n\n412\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.920\nNow I know it's from 50 to 100.\n\n413\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.040\nSo I'm gonna go to the middle.\n\n414\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.390\n75, too low.\n\n415\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.700\nI know it's 75 to 100.\n\n416\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.300\nI'm gonna go to the middle,\nlet's go to 90.\n\n417\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:46.160\nToo high, right, 90 to 75,\nI'm gonna come to the middle of those,\n\n418\n00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.542\nright, which is like 82.\n\n419\n00:22:48.542 --> 00:22:52.160\n&gt;&gt; So whoa, not 823,\n\n420\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.375\n82, see, I broke it.\n\n421\n00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:58.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So be careful there,\n\n422\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.538\nI told you it was broke,\nso let's try that again,\n\n423\n00:23:02.538 --> 00:23:06.400\n50 too high, that's the opposite so\n\n424\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.400\nI'm gonna copme to 25, too low, so 50, 25\n&gt;&gt; So 38, too high.\n\n425\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:18.480\nI want to come in the middle of 25 and\n38, which is roughly 31.\n\n426\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.340\nYep, roughly 31.\n\n427\n00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.540\nToo high, so 31 and 25.\n\n428\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:29.460\nRight, so I'm just kind of bouncing and\nsqueezing it.\n\n429\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.270\nLet's do 27, too low.\n\n430\n00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.170\n29, too high, 28.\n\n431\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:40.320\n&gt;&gt; All right so if I do that, if I have 1\nto 100 I can usually win in about 8 turns.\n\n432\n00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:47.650\nAlways, that's different than\nif you started going 35, 29.\n\n433\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.360\nEssentially, you're just cutting it\nin half, so you know where to guess.\n\n434\n00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.170\nDon't tell the people who\nare playing this game.\n\n435\n00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.711\nRight just let them guess.\n\n436\n00:23:55.711 --> 00:23:59.062\nThat assumes that you know where\nthe beginning and end are.\n\n437\n00:23:59.062 --> 00:24:02.413\nYou really wanted to make it\ndifficult you can change that.\n\n438\n00:24:02.413 --> 00:24:04.825\n&gt;&gt; So\nyour program here is choosing a number?\n\n439\n00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:05.830\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n440\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.448\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so it's choosing our\nrandom number between 1 and 100.\n\n441\n00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:11.123\nAnd then you have to guess it.\n\n442\n00:24:11.123 --> 00:24:11.793\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n443\n00:24:11.793 --> 00:24:13.602\n&gt;&gt; And to some extent Zac I think for\n\n444\n00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:18.150\nthis read me take mulitple user guesses\n&gt;&gt; Take multiple guesses from a user until\n\n445\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:18.980\na condition is met.\n\n446\n00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.890\nThat is true, right?\n\n447\n00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.270\nAfter each guess we should be able to\ndetermine less than, greater than, or\n\n448\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.140\nequal to conditions.\n\n449\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.170\nThat is exactly true as well, all right?\n\n450\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.250\nThere are a few things that\nare a little odd to me.\n\n451\n00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.080\nWhat is your guess?\n\n452\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.870\nWell, this is a lot of explanation for\na game.\n\n453\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.310\nUsually there's instructions and\nother stuff, so it's not quite refined,\n\n454\n00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:46.260\nbut ultimately, the core of our\nlogic was taking user guesses and\n\n455\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.430\nbeing able to compare those.\n\n456\n00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:50.840\nWe've accomplished that, but I don't\nknow if I would call this game done.\n\n457\n00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.030\nWe definitely don't have time in this\nepisode to kind of polish it up and\n\n458\n00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.220\nfinish it, so to speak.\n\n459\n00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.920\n&gt;&gt; So there will be more, and this is take\na guess, this episode is take a guess.\n\n460\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.850\nAnd Justin, anything else you'd\nlike to say before we move on?\n\n461\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, I just wanna reiterate,\nremember, small steps,\n\n462\n00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.300\nit'll help you keep things moving forward,\ninstead of keep you frustrated and\n\n463\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.320\nkinda looking at your computer screen\nlike, why are you not working?\n\n464\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.740\nSo do take that to heart\nif you learn nothing else\n\n465\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.960\nfrom these series of episodes.\n\n466\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.420\n&gt;&gt; And they're great episodes applied\nfundamentals, guess the number.\n\n467\n00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.730\nMake sure you watch every episode and\n\n468\n00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.140\nyou'll be in the course library too\nwhere there's lots of other videos that\n\n469\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.610\nare designed to do one thing, help you\ngo further, so check those out too.\n\n470\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.920\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevProTV,\n\n471\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.470\na good dev pro is always learning.\n\n472\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.010\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach memos.\n\n473\n00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n474\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.347\n&gt;&gt; We will see you again soon.\n\n475\n00:25:40.347 -->

It is good to see you as well Zach, and\n\n10\n00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:38.302\nI tell you what, I'm gonna need\nyou to tell that to my girlfriend.\n\n11\n00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:40.824\nBut how are you today?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm doing great and I'm really\n\n12\n00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:44.468\nenjoying this series, it's fabulous.\n&gt;&gt; Well hopefully I can continue to\n\n13\n00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:48.330\ndeliver and you know it's kind of\nbeen repetitive up to this point.\n\n14\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.300\nSmall little steps.\n\n15\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.410\nWe're moving forward, and to some\nextent we hit a done state of our game.\n\n16\n00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.130\nIf we wanted to,\n\n17\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.890\nwe could have people play this as long\nas we provide appropriate explanation.\n\n18\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.320\nBut if, let's say that Zach,\nyou were not part of this series, right?\n\n19\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.610\nIf I handed this over to you and\nI started the game.\n\n20\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.110\nIf it just said, what's the guess?\n\n21\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.850\nYou'd go, what am I guessing?\n\n22\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.720\nI don't know what I'm doing, right?\n&gt;&gt; That is\n\n23\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.321\ncorrect.\n&gt;&gt; Most games either have some kind\n\n24\n00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:18.380\nof leaflet.\n\n25\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.230\nI'm not big on actually publishing\nphysical print outs and going,\n\n26\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.230\nwell Zach I'm gonna to\nhave you play a game, but\n\n27\n00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.687\nhere's a little pamphlet to\ntell you how to play the game.\n\n28\n00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:31.380\nIt would be nice that, when the game\nstarts, it says hey, here's what's up.\n\n29\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.090\nHere's how you play and\nit gives you a chance to read.\n\n30\n00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.020\nSomething that bothers me,\nI'm not saying I'm opposed to this,\n\n31\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.810\nI've seen scrolling screens?\n\n32\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.248\nIt's cool if they're slow enough for\nyou to actually read them.\n\n33\n00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:50.410\nBut I've seen some screens that\nmaybe they're not scrolling but\n\n34\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.810\nthey like flip or they change.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n35\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.440\n&gt;&gt; Without any input from me.\n\n36\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.910\nWell, you're making an assumption\nabout the reading and\n\n37\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.790\ncomprehension of your respective user.\n\n38\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.670\nIt bothers me.\n\n39\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.070\nMaybe I'm totally off base,\n\n40\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.870\nbut this is some of my implicit\nbias that I'm gonna put into here.\n\n41\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.980\nNow, this is not necessarily a have-to,\nas we just said.\n\n42\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.420\nBut it is very helpful for\nlooking for a more polished state.\n\n43\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.940\nAnd will be helpful to see, okay,\nwell how do I put these together?\n\n44\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.130\nHow do I separate these?\n\n45\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.141\nHow do I wait for the user to be finished\nand then we're good to go, right?\n\n46\n00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:33.136\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe screen, make our plan of action, and\n\n47\n00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.490\nthen actually impliment it.\n\n48\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.339\nAgain we're gonna be\nbreaking our law here.\n\n49\n00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.306\nI couldn't, I guess I could,\nmake up all these dates, and maybe I am.\n\n50\n00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:47.604\nSo we're going to add instructions.\n\n51\n00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:57.422\nWoah, to the game, When the game starts.\n\n52\n00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:02.330\nThese instructions, Will\n\n53\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.850\nprovide the user some basic information.\n\n54\n00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:12.910\nAs follows.\n\n55\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.730\nNumber one, the title of the game.\n\n56\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.737\nRight, what am I playing?\n\n57\n00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:25.610\nNumber two, rules of engagement, I guess.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n58\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.320\n&gt;&gt; And then a prompt to continue\n\n59\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.470\nto the actual game start.\n\n60\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.934\nTo actual game start.\n\n61\n00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:43.120\nAnd I think that'll actually\ngive us our three pieces.\n\n62\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.500\nWhat's the title, what are we playing,\nhow do we play it?\n\n63\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.470\nAnd then allow me elect.\n\n64\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.640\nOkay, I'm ready to play now,\n\n65\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.940\nlet's do this.\n&gt;&gt; I like it!\n\n66\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.898\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so\n\n67\n00:03:56.898 --> 00:03:59.775\nprompt to continue to the actual game.\n\n68\n00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:03.325\nWe're gonna do these one at a time,\nmake sure, and\n\n69\n00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:07.150\nwe may have to tweak this\nas things come along.\n\n70\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.550\nBut if we come back over to our code here,\nwe look at our game function.\n\n71\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.297\nIt's game, we said the number,\nwhen things get started, and\n\n72\n00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.845\nthen we go into the loop\nalmost immediately.\n\n73\n00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.900\nThe question is, where do I place this?\n\n74\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.140\nWhere does it make most sense\nto place these instructions.\n\n75\n00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.470\nWhere does the game actually start?\n\n76\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.550\nSo if I look through this,\nwell, while True,\n\n77\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.700\nthis is where all the game's\nactually happening.\n\n78\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.524\nThis is like I've hit the start button,\nif you're an old school gamer.\n\n79\n00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:43.343\nOr maybe you've put in your quarter or\nwhatever it may be, you've hit the OK.\n\n80\n00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:47.450\nI think the instructions\nare probably best up here.\n\n81\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.049\nCuz they should print one time and\nnot every time you take a guess.\n\n82\n00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:53.400\nCuz that would be,\nnumber one, kind of annoying.\n\n83\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.040\nAnd number two, kinda pointless.\n\n84\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.760\nHopefully, you don't forget what game\nyou're playing between the guesses\n\n85\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.300\nof the number.\n\n86\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.933\nSo all we're gonna do is\n\n87\n00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:11.230\nprint('Welcom to a simple\n\n88\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:20.198\ngame: Guess The Number!') I know it was.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:21.076\n&gt;&gt; I was putting a lot of\n\n90\n00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:22.450\nemphasis on that.\n\n91\n00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.605\nAll right so\nif I come over here in our python3 main.\n\n92\n00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:27.580\nWelcom to a simple game: Guess The Number!\n\n93\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.680\nBut notice that it immediately\nhops into the game.\n\n94\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.990\nYou go okay, well that's cool.\n\n95\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.805\nIn addition to with this text, I find it\na little bit difficult to reason about.\n\n96\n00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:43.330\nTo go well, what am I doing here.\n\n97\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.710\nAll right, so if I now come here,\nhow do I stop it?\n\n98\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.280\nHow do I get that prompt?\n\n99\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.650\nBecause I think that prompt\nis actually gonna allow me to\n\n100\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.630\nreason about this a little more\nabout what's the separation.\n\n101\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.470\nSo technically I've given\nthe title of the game.\n\n102\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.770\nI need a prompt to continue\nto the actual game start.\n\n103\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo if we come back over here,\n\n104\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:18.496\nwell, how about we say,\n\n105\n00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:23.047\nWhen you are ready...\n\n106\n00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.900\nPress any key to continue.\n\n107\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.660\nAnd you've probably seen things like this.\n\n108\n00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.690\nSo notice this input is the same input,\nI'm taking user input from the terminal.\n\n109\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.290\nI had this not being\nassigned to a variable,\n\n110\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.620\nI don't actually care what\nkey they press at this point.\n\n111\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.130\nI could, maybe in the future.\n\n112\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.731\nBut right now, I don't care.\n\n113\n00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:57.920\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n114\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.111\nBut now, let's go see how that\nchanges the dynamic of the game.\n\n115\n00:07:01.111 --> 00:07:05.360\nAll right, so I'm gonna Ctrl+C,\nclear, python3 main.\n\n116\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.920\nAnd, Welcom to a simple\ngame: Guess the number!\n\n117\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.597\nWhen you are ready...\n\n118\n00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:11.000\nPress any key to continue.\n\n119\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.100\nEnter and now I'm good to go.\n\n120\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.550\nSo these first two things are actually\npretty easy to implement.\n\n121\n00:07:19.945 --> 00:07:23.310\nThe other one's fairly easy,\ntakes a little bit of time,\n\n122\n00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.090\nand I wanna show you some things\nthat are going to be helpful.\n\n123\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.940\nSo we're close, but really what should\nhappen, I think, is we print the title,\n\n124\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.790\nwe print the rules and\nthen you say are you ready to continue?\n\n125\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.660\nYep, looks good to me.\n\n126\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.500\nAll right, so let's come back here and\nwe say you know what?\n\n127\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.000\nPrint.\n\n128\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.531\nWow, that is a welcom,\nthere's an e there on welcome.\n\n129\n00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:55.530\nHere are the rules.\n\n130\n00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.548\nAll right, so I have a print.\n\n131\n00:07:58.548 --> 00:08:01.070\nI want to print the next line.\n\n132\n00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.164\nAnd then I'm going to print.\n\n133\n00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:05.114\nAnd I'm gonna put a set\nof parenthesis here.\n\n134\n00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:09.668\nBecause I'm going to use a helpful\ntrick when you have multi line\n\n135\n00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:13.310\nstrings that maybe you want\nto format in your code.\n\n136\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:19.120\nSo they actually print out some reasonable\nfacsimile of what you have in your code.\n\n137\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.340\nBy doing this I can do multiple strings,\nand\n\n138\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.900\nthey'll be continued, they're, I think\nthey are called line continuations.\n\n139\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.040\nThen kind of just squeeze them together,\nokay?\n\n140\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.375\nSo let's see here,\n\n141\n00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:41.673\nI'm thinking of a number, all right, and\n\n142\n00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:49.909\nthen I'm gonna come to the next line,\nAnd quotes, all right.\n\n143\n00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:53.055\nI will ask for a guess.\n\n144\n00:08:56.793 --> 00:08:59.540\nAnd then next line and quotes.\n\n145\n00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:07.271\nFor each guess, I\n\n146\n00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:13.466\nwill let you know the following.\n\n147\n00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:18.610\nAnd next line, quotes and\nthen I'm gonna indent over and\n\n148\n00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.800\nsay if the guess is too low\n\n149\n00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:32.910\nEnd quotes.\n\n150\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:41.404\nIf the guess is too high, Quotes.\n\n151\n00:09:41.404 --> 00:09:44.888\nIf the guess is correct.\n\n152\n00:09:48.802 --> 00:09:49.821\nAll right?\n\n153\n00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:55.003\nAnd then you will win $1 million,\n\n154\n00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:58.200\nno, not a promise.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.750\n&gt;&gt; Easy there.\n\n156\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.073\nNumber one, I don't know,\nmaybe Zach, you have $1 million.\n\n157\n00:10:03.073 --> 00:10:03.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:05.070\n&gt;&gt; To go with this.\n\n159\n00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:11.371\nYou will win upon a correct guess, right?\n\n160\n00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:12.779\nThat's kind of self-explanatory, but\n\n161\n00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.400\nlet's make it explicit, right?\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n162\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.660\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; Just like that.\n\n163\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.130\nNow what this should do,\nnotice this quotes, quotes, quotes.\n\n164\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.410\nThis is a whole block of text.\n\n165\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.030\nLet's see, these are our rules.\n\n166\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.993\nThis looks good, right?\n\n167\n00:10:25.993 --> 00:10:30.950\nTo some extent we're done, but\nthere's a few other things.\n\n168\n00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.470\nNumber one,\n\n169\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.680\nI forgot to put, I think these are best\nwith spaces here instead of nestled.\n\n170\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.110\nThere we go!\nAll right, so let's come back.\n\n171\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.570\nLet's kill it, let's clear python3, main.\n\n172\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.048\nThat is really hard to read.\n\n173\n00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:45.071\n[LAUGH].\n\n174\n00:10:45.071 --> 00:10:48.260\nAll right, you're like\n&gt;&gt; It's a little fragmented.\n\n175\n00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to a simple game.\n\n176\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.970\nGuess, you're like all right I'm good.\n\n177\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.341\nHere are the rules,\nI'm thinking of a number, I will ask for\n\n178\n00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:57.417\na guess for okay, I don't.\n\n179\n00:10:57.417 --> 00:11:00.097\nAnd here's the problem,\nthe string continuations are great, but\n\n180\n00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:01.090\nthey're very literal.\n\n181\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.020\nWhat they do is they actually\nsquish it all together and\n\n182\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.120\nthey just keep the spaces.\n&gt;&gt; What we really want are new lines.\n\n183\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.470\nSo we could do print, print, print, print,\nprint, or alternatively, let's kill this.\n\n184\n00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:19.000\nAlternatively, we could come over here and\nsay, here are the rules, that's fine.\n\n185\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.941\nBut then \\n, \\n,\nthat is now gonna give me a new line.\n\n186\n00:11:27.648 --> 00:11:32.760\n\\n, \\n, \\n, \\n and /n.\n\n187\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.660\nLooks fine.\n\n188\n00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.940\nAnd I think we're good.\n\n189\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.560\nOkay, so I added a /n.\n\n190\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.060\nIf you put individual prints,\nyou actually get those by default.\n\n191\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.060\nBut because I have a single print but\na bunch of, I only get one at the end.\n\n192\n00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.640\nSo technically, if I'm not mistaken,\nI don't need this one, but eh,\n\n193\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.710\nit'll be all right.\n\n194\n00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.580\nSo let's get head in\npython3 about messsed up.\n\n195\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.932\nZach is about to let me mess up.\n\n196\n00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:01.730\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n197\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.760\na lot nicer.\n\n198\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.704\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n199\n00:12:04.704 --> 00:12:07.500\nSo here we go I'm thinking of a number.\n\n200\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.235\nI will ask for a guess, for each guess\nI will let you know the following if\n\n201\n00:12:11.235 --> 00:12:12.927\nthe guess is too high, too low.\n\n202\n00:12:12.927 --> 00:12:15.950\nAnd if the guess is correct,\nyou will win upon a correct guess.\n\n203\n00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.938\nWhen you're ready,\npress any key to continue.\n\n204\n00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:22.840\nAt this point I'm gonna go yep, and\nthen it starts right into the game.\n\n205\n00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.570\nI think this is a nicer experience, right?\n\n206\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.660\nYou know what, but\nas the perfectionist that I am.\n\n207\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes you are.\n\n208\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.340\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I necessarily\n\n209\n00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.720\nlike all of this.\n\n210\n00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.450\nI start the game down below right,\nthe instructions are still on the screen,\n\n211\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:47.120\nthat's fine but maybe it'd be better\nto bring the game back up top right?\n\n212\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.130\nSo what does that do?\n\n213\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.651\nIf you've watched a previous\nset of episodes, right?\n\n214\n00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.283\nWhere we've built hangman,\nthen you're going, wait a minute,\n\n215\n00:12:58.283 --> 00:12:59.930\nwe've already done this.\n\n216\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.550\nRight, we shouldn't be\nreinventing the wheel.\n\n217\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.960\nWe're gonna go look at a previous project.\n&gt;&gt; If you're watching these out of order,\n\n218\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.808\nthen you'll go,\n\n219\n00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.280\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n220\n00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.044\n&gt;&gt; This is a little bit of a preview.\n\n221\n00:13:12.044 --> 00:13:15.490\nBut I wanna emphasize refer to\nprevious code that you've written\n\n222\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.550\nthat already solves a problem.\n\n223\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.540\nDon't try to necessarily\nmemorize everything,right?\n\n224\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.570\nUse previous experience to build upon and\n\n225\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.490\nmake things that are nicer\nyou already know, okay.\n\n226\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.340\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're going exploring.\n\n227\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.769\nIs that supposed to rhyme,\nthat was going and\n\n228\n00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:34.770\nexploring?\n&gt;&gt; Going and exploring.\n\n229\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.155\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it rhymes,\n\n230\n00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:40.330\nthere was some ing things there.\n\n231\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.660\nSo if I come back over here I know that\nif I come into my documents, hangman.\n\n232\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.040\nThere's main.py we made\na lot of changes to this.\n\n233\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.643\nWe're gonna open this and\nnotice in my editor is says, hey,\n\n234\n00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:54.100\nyou have two things named main.\n\n235\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.690\nBut really all I care about\nis this part right here.\n\n236\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.770\nSo the subprocess call\n\n237\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.790\ncls if the platform system is Windows,\notherwise call clear, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.930\nSo we're not gonna keep this\nin a function, that's fine.\n\n239\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:19.000\nBut what I'm thinking is we\ncan just put this right here.\n\n240\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.030\nSo I copied and pasted,\nyou're like [NOISE], blasphemy Justin.\n\n241\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.160\nI know, I know.\n\n242\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:32.040\nSo call, and for now I'm just gonna\nput a little clear the screen.\n\n243\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.869\nAnd I'm gonna get rid of this over here,\nclear the screen.\n\n244\n00:14:34.108 --> 00:14:38.002\nAnd I'm gonna show you something that\npeople do upon copying and pasting, and\n\n245\n00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.900\nyou're like, ahh, it's good,\neverything's great.\n\n246\n00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.190\nLet's go over and try to run it.\n\n247\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:50.470\nQue, python3, main, and, name\n\"subprocess\" is not defined, NameError.\n\n248\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.280\nNameError?\nThat's kinda odd, right?\n\n249\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.580\nNameError, name subprocess is not defined.\n\n250\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.828\nThat means not really have something\ncalled subprocess in the scope\n\n251\n00:14:59.828 --> 00:15:00.930\nof this file.\n\n252\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.850\nThis file doesn't know anything and\nthat's because I forgot to import it.\n\n253\n00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.428\nSo I'm gonna go back and\nI'm gonna import subprocess.\n\n254\n00:15:07.428 --> 00:15:13.830\nImport subprocess, okay.\n\n255\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.520\nAnd if you haven't watched this,\n\n256\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.360\nsubprocess allows me to create\nsystem level function calls.\n\n257\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.551\nLike the things we do on the terminal,\n\n258\n00:15:23.551 --> 00:15:26.900\nI can programmatically do\nthose through sub process.\n\n259\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.750\nThat's the easiest way to explain it.\n\n260\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:33.204\nSo I type ls, subprocess lets me type ls,\nprogrammatically,\n\n261\n00:15:33.204 --> 00:15:35.648\nI don't actually have to type ls.\n\n262\n00:15:35.648 --> 00:15:38.390\nSo input, you're like, all right, cool.\n\n263\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.760\nIt's all good to go now,\nwe're good, we're good, we're good.\n\n264\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.665\nPlatform is not defined, this single\nline has platform inside of it,\n\n265\n00:15:47.665 --> 00:15:50.126\nplatform.system.\n\n266\n00:15:50.126 --> 00:15:55.298\nNotice it's also a NameError,\nI forgot to import platform.\n\n267\n00:15:55.298 --> 00:16:00.193\nAnd if you've ever heard me say be very\ncareful about copying and pasting,\n\n268\n00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:04.870\nit's because of things like this that\nI say be very careful about them.\n\n269\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.204\nIf you're not, you're like aw man.\n\n270\n00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:11.990\nHere's also the rub.\n\n271\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.860\nI know this works in this other project.\n\n272\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.519\nI copy and paste.\n\n273\n00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.600\nI start writing a bunch of other code.\n\n274\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.460\nAnd then, hey, I test it.\n\n275\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.350\nAnd now it's hard for me to determine\nif it's the new code that I wrote, or\n\n276\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.880\nif it's the copy pasted code that I wrote.\n\n277\n00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.240\nSo it makes it harder to debug.\n\n278\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.840\nNotice I did copy and paste.\n\n279\n00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.481\nNot necessarily the greatest strategy.\n\n280\n00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:35.585\nBut I know that this works,\nor should've worked.\n\n281\n00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:38.204\nBut I tested it to make sure,\ndid I forget anything?\n\n282\n00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:43.350\nIs there some assumptions from my\nprevious code that works for this one?\n\n283\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.330\nSo import subprocess, import platform.\n\n284\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.690\nI think this should work.\n\n285\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.160\nAnd now, did I save?\n\n286\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.430\nMake sure you save, right?\n\n287\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.940\nIf you have a little white dot up here,\nright there.\n\n288\n00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.850\nSo if I, notice it turns white.\n\n289\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.989\nIf it's white, you haven't saved,\nso you may get unexpected results.\n\n290\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.080\nSo here we go.\n\n291\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.010\nCross your fingers, Zach.\n\n292\n00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:11.126\nAll right, notice my prompt at the top,\nright, with my name and stuff,\n\n293\n00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:11.933\nit went away.\n\n294\n00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:13.559\nIt's a subtle difference.\n&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.\n\n295\n00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:15.027\n&gt;&gt; But welcome to a simple game.\n\n296\n00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:16.410\nGuess the number.\nHere are the rules.\n\n297\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.040\nAnd then I hit Enter.\n\n298\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:25.570\nIt's better, but I would like to\nstart the game at the top, right?\n\n299\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.470\nSo now I'm going against my own rules.\n\n300\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.467\nI'm going to copy, and I'm gonna paste.\n\n301\n00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:34.755\nBecause after someone hits Let's Go,\n\n302\n00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:38.163\nI'm gonna clear the screen\nagain before the game starts.\n\n303\n00:17:38.163 --> 00:17:39.322\nOkay, so.\n\n304\n00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:42.910\nHere we go.\n\n305\n00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.710\nI think we got it.\n\n306\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.210\nSo I'm gonna clear the screen.\n\n307\n00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.419\nPrint the rules.\nWhen they're ready we're gonna continue.\n\n308\n00:17:47.419 --> 00:17:49.170\nThen I'm gonna clear the screen again.\n\n309\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.415\nGrab the random number.\n\n310\n00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:55.100\nAnd now we're ready to play, right?\n\n311\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.420\nSo if we come over here, we kill.\n\n312\n00:17:58.459 --> 00:18:02.270\nAnd main.py,\nwe cleared the screen, looks good.\n\n313\n00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.244\nI read all the instructions.\n\n314\n00:18:03.244 --> 00:18:06.112\nI'm like, all right,\nI know what we're doing.\n\n315\n00:18:06.112 --> 00:18:09.291\nHit enter and then now I've started.\n&gt;&gt; Bang.\n\n316\n00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:10.227\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n317\n00:18:10.227 --> 00:18:13.309\nAnd now it gives a more\ngame like experience and\n\n318\n00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:17.206\nit's not just a top to bottom\nkind of experience, right?\n\n319\n00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:18.322\nSo [SOUND].\n\n320\n00:18:18.322 --> 00:18:24.310\nNow, I could make the argument that\nafter each guess, I could clear again.\n\n321\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.104\nBut [SOUND], it gets a little iffy.\n\n322\n00:18:28.104 --> 00:18:31.320\nSo for now, I'm going to say,\nyou know what?\n\n323\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.737\nIt is 50, too low.\n\n324\n00:18:34.737 --> 00:18:36.566\n75, too low.\n\n325\n00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:38.433\n87, too high.\n\n326\n00:18:38.433 --> 00:18:40.650\n85, too high.\n\n327\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.823\n82, too low.\n\n328\n00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:45.817\n84, yay, I've won.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n329\n00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:46.403\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n330\n00:18:46.403 --> 00:18:47.508\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Well,\n\n331\n00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:51.071\nyou are good at this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, it's cuz I know\n\n332\n00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:53.980\nthe appropriate strategies.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.045\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like hangman, always guess R, S,\n\n334\n00:18:56.045 --> 00:18:57.050\nT, L and E, right?\n\n335\n00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.180\nThose are the most common\nletters in the English language,\n\n336\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.570\nassuming that you're playing in English.\n\n337\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.324\nSo, technically,\nour game is at a done point.\n\n338\n00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:07.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.100\n&gt;&gt; We have a nicer experience.\n\n340\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.250\nNow if I hand this over to Zach, and\nhe was not part of these episodes,\n\n341\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.916\nhe would go, okay, I know what I'm doing.\n\n342\n00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:17.990\nAll right, let me play.\n\n343\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.350\nIs it like blow your mind game dynamics?\n\n344\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.270\nNo.\n\n345\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:26.130\nBut we have actually employed\na fair amount of the concepts that\n\n346\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.160\nwe've learned in order to achieve this.\n&gt;&gt; What if we wanted to add a graphic?\n\n347\n00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.480\nLet's say like a platypus\nholding a ruler or something?\n\n348\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.920\nI mean, is that something we could do?\n\n349\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.426\nCan we add graphics?\n&gt;&gt; We could add graphics, but\n\n350\n00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.430\nwe could graphics maybe using ASCII Art.\n&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.\n\n351\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.460\n&gt;&gt; If we had a different terminal\n\n352\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:47.160\nenvironment that would allow us\nto add images, then we could.\n\n353\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.638\nBut a lot of times our\nparticular environment here,\n\n354\n00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:54.812\nwhich is Bash, not really.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no.\n\n355\n00:19:54.812 --> 00:19:58.814\nIf you wanted a purely\ngraphical user interface,\n\n356\n00:19:58.814 --> 00:20:01.873\nthat gets a little more complicated.\n\n357\n00:20:01.873 --> 00:20:05.228\nBecause you actually have to\nprogramatically determine what the window\n\n358\n00:20:05.228 --> 00:20:06.936\nis, and what's inside the window.\n\n359\n00:20:06.936 --> 00:20:11.882\nAnd though it would be interesting, and\na little off-putting, to have a platypus\n\n360\n00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:14.969\nholding a tennis racket.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:16.496\n&gt;&gt; It would bring some attention,\n\n362\n00:20:16.496 --> 00:20:19.020\nmaybe distract from the game respectively.\n\n363\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.120\nBut that is a little more complicated,\nbut that's a common question.\n\n364\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.190\nPeople are like, I want graphics.\n\n365\n00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.923\nWell, let's worry about logic first.\n&gt;&gt; Worry\n\n366\n00:20:25.923 --> 00:20:28.480\nabout logic first.\n&gt;&gt; Graphics actually require you to have\n\n367\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.390\na fair amount of, okay,\nI need to set up the window.\n\n368\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.970\nI need to set up the window size.\n\n369\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.520\nWhat are things on the screen?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n370\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.140\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot at play when you start\n\n371\n00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.345\nbuilding graphical user interfaces.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n372\n00:20:38.345 --> 00:20:39.681\nwell this has been a great episode.\n\n373\n00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:40.707\nI've thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n374\n00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.710\nAdd user instructions.\n\n375\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.300\nAdam, before we move on,\nwhat else would you like to say?\n\n376\n00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Well you know we are at a done state,\n\n377\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.250\nbut all good software is never done.\n\n378\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.550\nI don't know if I would\nleave it at this point.\n\n379\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.690\nAs like I'm finished, hands off.\n\n380\n00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.550\nYou could, right?\n\n381\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.060\nIt is done.\n\n382\n00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.110\nBut I think it's good to think about\nhow do we make our code better?\n\n383\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.028\nI have big mantra of,\nmake it work, then make it better.\n\n384\n00:21:05.028 --> 00:21:08.620\nWell we've made it work,\nand it's pretty good.\n\n385\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.489\nBut we wanna make it better.\n\n386\n00:21:09.489 --> 00:21:14.534\nMake a little more readable, because as it\nstands, it's not too horribly complicated.\n\n387\n00:21:14.534 --> 00:21:18.060\nBut there's things like, why are you\nmaking that a number again, right?\n\n388\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.326\nThat guess as a number.\n\n389\n00:21:19.326 --> 00:21:23.750\nMaybe we could abstract that away so\nwe have a little bit of refactoring to do.\n\n390\n00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.842\nAnd technically I get to play as\nlong as I want to until I win.\n\n391\n00:21:28.842 --> 00:21:31.940\nThat's kind of horrible for\ngame dynamics, right?\n\n392\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.690\nIf you get to play if you're invincible,\nthen games quickly become boring.\n\n393\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.680\nBut if you can make them difficult,\nright, then you have to apply skill.\n\n394\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.920\nSo, we're gonna do some changing\naround to make it more readable.\n\n395\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.010\nAnd then maybe we'll start\nadding a few more features.\n\n396\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.070\n&gt;&gt; You're doing a great job,\n\n397\n00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.970\nJustin, wonderful.\n\n398\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.910\nApplied Fundamentals, guess the number.\n\n399\n00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.190\nSee all the episodes.\n\n400\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.230\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n401\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.590\nAnd you'll be in the course library, too,\n\n402\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.800\nwhere there's thousands of other\nvideos designed to do one thing.\n\n403\n00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.770\nHelp you go further.\n\n404\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.940\nCheck those out, too.\n\n405\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.360\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DEVPROTV.\n\n406\n00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.510\nYou know,\na good Dev Pro is always learning.\n\n407\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.762\nThanks for watching.\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n408\n00:22:03.762 --> 00:22:04.510\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n409\n00:22:04.510 -->

go.\n\n3\n00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:21.560\nI'm your host Zach Memos with this episode\nof Applied Fundamentals, Guess The Number.\n\n4\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.350\nThe title of this episode\nis Re-factor to functions.\n\n5\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.140\nNow who's gonna help us?\n\n6\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.190\nWe have to find someone who can help,\n\n7\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.760\nthere he is Justin Dennison right here,\ngood to see you.\n\n8\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Well good thing I walked in the frame\nright [LAUGH] before you said anything cuz\n\n9\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.460\nit would've been awkward,\nhow are you today Zack?\n\n10\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.670\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great and I really am\nenjoying this series you do a great job.\n\n11\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, I definitely do try and\nhopefully we're refactoring the function.\n\n12\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.850\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n13\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.249\nWell, in a previous episode I was like,\n\n14\n00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.580\nmaybe there's some other\nfeatures that we want right?\n\n15\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.432\nWe think about our plan,\nit's not quite what we envision but\n\n16\n00:00:54.432 --> 00:00:56.200\nwe do have a done state.\n\n17\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.960\nSo maybe we take a little bit of\na time out, and clean some things up.\n\n18\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.398\nMake them a little more readable.\n\n19\n00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:05.940\nMaybe, maybe we abstract away some of the,\n\n20\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.650\nall this stuff that's just\nin our main game function.\n\n21\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.910\nAnd ultimately that's what we're gonna do\nand we're gonna use functions to do that.\n\n22\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.290\nSo, Zach, it's gonna be interesting\nto see your perspective on how\n\n23\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.620\nit is now versus when we're, when we're\ndone with this little bit of refactoring.\n\n24\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.760\nSo, you know I think there's\nno better time than now to\n\n25\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.270\nactually get started on this.\n\n26\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.540\nSo let's take a look at the screen here.\n\n27\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n28\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's just the terminal.\n\n29\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.460\nLooks good, but\nlet's flip over to the code.\n\n30\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.380\nAnd here's what I mean,\nnotice everything is in a single function,\n\n31\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.530\nwhich there's nothing wrong with.\n\n32\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.140\nWe could technically leave this and\nto Zach, Zach could play it,\n\n33\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.380\nwe could have a grand old time.\n\n34\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.810\nMaybe get some Cheetos and Dr. Pepper.\n\n35\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.050\nIt'll be all great.\n\n36\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.470\nI don't know why we picked\nthose snack foods but we did.\n\n37\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.960\nAll right then.\n\n38\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.550\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n39\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.150\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n40\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou like cheese.\n\n41\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.190\nAnything with cheese in it you like that.\n\n42\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.620\n&gt;&gt; I do like cheese.\n\n43\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.980\nIt is gouda.\n\n44\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.700\n&gt;&gt; See what I did there.\n\n45\n00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I see what you did there.\n\n46\n00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.030\n&gt;&gt; Anyway.\n\n47\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.890\nSo if we look here, we have all of\nthe stuff but it's kind of hard.\n\n48\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.460\nI could take some time and go, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930\nWell this print function is kind of\nthe header or maybe it's the title.\n\n50\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.850\nHere, these are all the rules.\n\n51\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.550\nAnd then what is this doing?\n\n52\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.660\nWell this is the wait for user.\n\n53\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.510\nAnd then here's another clear screen.\n\n54\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.710\nAnd then okay, well there's guess and\nthen guess as a number.\n\n55\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.277\nThat's kind of a weird thing there, right.\n\n56\n00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, hm.\n&gt;&gt; I'm taking a user guess.\n\n57\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.220\nI'm taking user input,\n\n58\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.540\nthen I have to cast it to an int in\norder to do appropriate comparisons.\n\n59\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.175\nWe've seen that in a previous episode.\n\n60\n00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:36.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n61\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Having that right there,\n\n62\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.040\nit, really I would just like to say,\nhere's a guess, right.\n\n63\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.110\nGet user guess.\n\n64\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.040\nAnd then extract a way the whole\nconversions energized and\n\n65\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.820\nthe whole of that and\nthen we can reduce hang out, right?\n\n66\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.900\nSo, as we had that,\nwe should do a little bit to clean up.\n\n67\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.340\nSo, let's think about what we can do.\n\n68\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.430\nWell, first off, I think that\nprocess.com is the easiest one,\n\n69\n00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.390\nyou've watched the Hangman series and\nyou go but that's just clear screen.\n\n70\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.010\nIt is, it's actually clear screen\nthat is platform-fluid I guess.\n\n71\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.840\nSo it's like you on these platforms, do\nthis, you're on Windows, do the sub thing.\n\n72\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.280\nSo let's go to make a function\ncalled clear_screen and\n\n73\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.740\nall that's going to do is right here,\ngrab this, paste.\n\n74\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.860\nAnd then let's clear this out.\n\n75\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.570\nExcuse me.\n\n76\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.900\nLet's replace this with clear screen.\n\n77\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.660\nAnd then we're going to clear screen.\n\n78\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.910\nAnd now, before I go any further, Zach, if\nyou were to come along as someone who is\n\n79\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.160\nmaybe not necessarily deeply\nentrenched into programming.\n\n80\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.980\nIf you saw only this,\n\n81\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.280\nwould you have to guess what\nthey clear screen function does?\n\n82\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.502\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask you what does\nthe clear screen function do?\n\n83\n00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:57.676\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What does it do?\n\n84\n00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:03.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's see, python3 main.py,\nwe're trying to make sure.\n\n85\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.400\nSo that clear screen actually clears\nthe screen just like I'm typing on in\n\n86\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.230\ntemiral\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n87\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.050\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n88\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.130\nBut if I know that, that's a little\neasier to reason about than going what\n\n89\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.260\nis subprocess.call cls if platform.system\nis windows otherwise clear?\n\n90\n00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.100\nThere is a lot of logic in there.\n\n91\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.625\nYeah, but if I look at just here,\nI'm gonna clear the screen, right?\n\n92\n00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.157\n[SOUND] Clear the screen and\n\n93\n00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:30.505\nthen I'm gonna do some other\nstuff I do all of this print.\n\n94\n00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:35.470\nBut notice I changed one function and\nI made sure that it still worked.\n\n95\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.380\nNow as soon as I hit Enter, it clears\nthe screen again after that input, right?\n\n96\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.530\nWaiting for user input, and\nnow it's asking me for my guess.\n\n97\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.400\nAnd well I haven't changed anything else\nafter this, so I should be good, okay?\n\n98\n00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.530\nSo if I come back over here,\nactually let's stop this and\n\n99\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.505\nnow I look here,\nright now it's a single line.\n\n100\n00:04:58.505 --> 00:04:59.630\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n101\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.030\n&gt;&gt; But long term I may have other thing.\n\n102\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.099\nMaybe I wanna get a little creative,\nmaybe I have some art,\n\n103\n00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.910\nmaybe I do something really crazy and\nwhat is?\n\n104\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.300\nThis is printing the title, right?\n\n105\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.540\nOr we can call this print splash_screen.\n\n106\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.985\nSo let's create another\nfunction called print_title.\n\n107\n00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:26.420\nUh-oh, I accidentally hit the wrong\nkey and copied over that.\n\n108\n00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.098\nThere we go, let's try that again.\n\n109\n00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:31.456\nPrint_title.\n\n110\n00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:37.960\nAnd now, instead of this I'm\ngonna say print title, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.730\nAnd don't hit save as as I did.\n\n112\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.530\nSo now I've printed the title\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n113\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.210\n&gt;&gt; Everything looks good.\n\n114\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.130\nI always recommend when you're doing this,\n\n115\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.330\nwe're not doing any kind automated\ntesting or anything like that.\n\n116\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.470\nThere are ways to accomplish that but\n\n117\n00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.340\nthat's way outside the scope\nof where we are now.\n\n118\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.230\nWhen we come back we're\ngonna manually test this.\n\n119\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.840\nLooks good, looks good, everything still\nworks, nothing's broken, good to go.\n\n120\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.090\nSo let's kill that,\nclear and then come back.\n\n121\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.520\nNow if I look here, both of these prints\nare technically about printing the rules.\n\n122\n00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.460\nRight?\nSo we're gonna print the rules.\n\n123\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.680\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n124\n00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.481\nI'm gonna copy these, I'm gonna come here\nand make another function on print rules,\n\n125\n00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:25.500\nall right?\n\n126\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.130\nAnd you know what,\nI disobeyed my own recommendations.\n\n127\n00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.880\nWe forgot something, Zach.\n\n128\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.670\nSo we're gonna take a quick detour here.\n\n129\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.230\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n[CROSSTALK] paste these.\n\n130\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.592\nAnd I'm gonna come over to my readme,\nbecause we should make sure that,\n\n131\n00:06:43.592 --> 00:06:45.030\neven if we get started.\n\n132\n00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.850\nAnd it's perfectly okay if you do this.\n\n133\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.110\nYou're like I don't really know.\n\n134\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.340\nAm I doing everything I need to?\n\n135\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.430\nLet's go ahead and make our plan.\n\n136\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.235\nThese are some of the things\nthat we've already done.\n\n137\n00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:56.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That we're gonna make a list to\n\n138\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.660\nmake sure we catch everything, alright?\n\n139\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.094\nSo this is number four.\n\n140\n00:07:02.094 --> 00:07:03.252\n&gt;&gt; And then on the fourth.\n\n141\n00:07:03.252 --> 00:07:10.561\n&gt;&gt; And then we are going to refactor the\nfollowing areas into functions, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:13.370\nSo, well, what are we going to?\n\n143\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.232\nClearing the screen, Printing the title.\n\n144\n00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:23.865\nPrinting the rules.\n\n145\n00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:30.901\nAnd then, before we can do anything,\nlet's come back over here and\n\n146\n00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:32.701\nlook real quick before I save.\n\n147\n00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:37.450\nWith this input we're only\ndoing a very simple thing.\n\n148\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.260\nWe're effectively waiting on\nthe user to provide user input.\n\n149\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.130\nI would say maybe wait for user.\n\n150\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.060\nThat would be a little easier\nto reason about the intention,\n\n151\n00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.160\neven if we don't change anything,\nit conveys my intention.\n\n152\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.524\nSo I would say, another thing we're gonna\n\n153\n00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:59.598\ndo is waiting for user to start the game.\n\n154\n00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:04.818\nAnd then one last thing is abstract\nthe way this taking a user guess and\n\n155\n00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.799\nchanging it to an integer, all right?\n\n156\n00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:13.311\nSo taking the user guess and casting, or\n\n157\n00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:20.350\nlet's just call it changing to integer,\nokay?\n\n158\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.730\nSo we're gonna refactor\nthese following areas.\n\n159\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.650\nNow we've already done some of them.\n\n160\n00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.351\nI got ahead of myself.\n\n161\n00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:26.336\nI got a little excited, Zach.\n\n162\n00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:26.906\n&gt;&gt; You got excited.\n\n163\n00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:30.490\n&gt;&gt; I started too fast and\nthat's perfectly okay.\n\n164\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.320\nSometimes that's gonna happen.\n\n165\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.480\nBut if you remember,\nright, if you remember,\n\n166\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.090\nthen always come back,\nmake a list, make a plan.\n\n167\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.064\nThe review of what you're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n168\n00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:45.544\nBecause even if you already done some\nof them, being able to kind of plan,\n\n169\n00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:48.583\nthink about what you're\ntrying to accomplish for\n\n170\n00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:54.260\nthis particular kind of set time, is going\nto help you stay on task, all right?\n\n171\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.950\nSo Save, and\nnow I'm gonna come back over here.\n\n172\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.680\nAnd well,\nwe we're in the middle of printing rules.\n\n173\n00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.250\nAnd so I'm gonna take this out, and\n\n174\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.424\nI'm going to print_rules, all right?\n\n175\n00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.040\nSo I keep holding Shift and saving as.\n\n176\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So be careful there.\n\n177\n00:09:13.312 --> 00:09:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n178\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.301\n&gt;&gt; But notice our main game,\nbecause of our functions,\n\n179\n00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:21.220\nwe've kind of abstracted away\nthe implementation details.\n\n180\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.320\nAnd we're clearing the screen,\nwe're printing the title,\n\n181\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.290\nwe're printing the rules.\n\n182\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.460\nThose are the things that\nI'm trying to accomplish.\n\n183\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.000\nAll right, let's make sure\nthat we didn't break anything.\n\n184\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.490\nWe did, look at that.\n\n185\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.980\nSee, and that's why you test frequently.\n\n186\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.380\nSo where did that happen?\n\n187\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:48.090\nSo if we come here and look,\nit actually says we have an error here.\n\n188\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.170\nNow because of the way Python works,\nthe error may be there.\n\n189\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.150\nNotice it says def game.\n\n190\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.486\nIt may be there, says it's a syntax error.\n\n191\n00:09:57.486 --> 00:10:02.866\nThat means we haven't abided\nby the language rules, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:07.792\nKind of like the I before E except after\nC, or in sounding A in neighbor and weigh,\n\n193\n00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:08.382\nanyway.\n\n194\n00:10:08.382 --> 00:10:12.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I would tell you to be careful.\n\n195\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.740\nAny time you see a syntax error,\n\n196\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.320\ndefinitely look at the line\nthat it points you to.\n\n197\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.060\nBut then you should look probably\ntwo to three lines above, right?\n\n198\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.970\nSo this is an effective\ndebugging practice.\n\n199\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.470\nThis line is blank.\n\n200\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.340\nProbably not that one.\n\n201\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.980\nBut if I come up to this line,\nand you go, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.660\nAll right, it looks fine.\n\n203\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.380\nOkay, well,\nhow could there be a syntax error here?\n\n204\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.174\nBut if you look,\nsee these two parentheses?\n\n205\n00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:41.837\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n206\n00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:45.510\n&gt;&gt; If I have left ones,\nit's just like your shoe.\n\n207\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.040\nYou got a left one,\n\n208\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.060\nyou should probably have a right one,\notherwise it looks ridiculous, right?\n\n209\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.760\nSo if you come over here, boom boom,\nwe accidentally cut those parentheses off.\n\n210\n00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.689\nAnd that's okay, but,\nby testing early and often and\n\n211\n00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:03.950\nutilizing the fact that if\nyou get a syntax error.\n\n212\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.763\nLook at that line and\nkind of look a little bit above it.\n\n213\n00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:09.274\nA lot of times the error\npropagates down a little bit, and\n\n214\n00:11:09.274 --> 00:11:11.275\nthat is just by the nature\nof how Python runs.\n\n215\n00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:14.361\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin, you created this\nteachable moment, didn't you?\n\n216\n00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:17.769\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\nthis totally happened by accident.\n\n217\n00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:21.688\nBut, I'm glad it did happen because\nit's not all rainbows and unicorns.\n\n218\n00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:22.289\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n219\n00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:24.270\n&gt;&gt; And you need to be able to figure\nout these problems for yourself.\n\n220\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.398\n&gt;&gt; Right, perfect.\n\n221\n00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:29.158\n&gt;&gt; Revealing my magic.\n\n222\n00:11:29.158 --> 00:11:31.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I, in fact,\n\n223\n00:11:31.076 --> 00:11:32.959\ndid that on complete accident.\n\n224\n00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.485\n&gt;&gt; And we know that you\nare a very honest man as well.\n\n225\n00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:37.847\n&gt;&gt; I am, so let's try it again.\n\n226\n00:11:37.847 --> 00:11:39.117\nHere's hoping.\n\n227\n00:11:39.117 --> 00:11:42.606\nAnd it looks good,\nit looks like we're back to what we had.\n\n228\n00:11:42.606 --> 00:11:43.253\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n229\n00:11:43.253 --> 00:11:46.145\n&gt;&gt; Now notice, I just hit Enter,\nand I immediately, okay,\n\n230\n00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:47.570\nkilled the system, right?\n\n231\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.580\nSo what, we'll have to deal with that,\nwe'll add some error checking later.\n\n232\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.850\nBut let's not worry,\nwe're worried about cleaning up.\n\n233\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.200\nIf we come back to my readme,\nwe're waiting for the user to start.\n\n234\n00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.070\nWe've actually accomplished these\nthree goals in two functions.\n\n235\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.810\nThis is the wait for user.\n\n236\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.080\nRight now it's very simple.\n\n237\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.170\nBut maybe it's not.\n\n238\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.667\nMaybe eventually while you're waiting for\nthe user, you have some kinda just like.\n\n239\n00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:18.585\nMaybe there's another loop here\nthat's like creating some kinda like,\n\n240\n00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:19.961\nI don't know, crazy animation.\n\n241\n00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:20.497\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n242\n00:12:20.497 --> 00:12:24.005\n&gt;&gt; Starburst,\nit still will wait for a user.\n\n243\n00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:25.852\nSo you can abstract that away.\n\n244\n00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:32.931\nI'll come up here and I say wait_for-user.\n\n245\n00:12:32.931 --> 00:12:38.240\nAnd a little there and grab this here.\n\n246\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:47.075\nPaste, and then, [SOUND] wait_for_user.\n\n247\n00:12:47.075 --> 00:12:54.040\nAll right, now I feel compelled\nto be very explicit about this.\n\n248\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.832\nI'm doing this to show you kinda the\nrefactoring process, how to think about\n\n249\n00:12:58.832 --> 00:13:01.760\nthis, and the fact that functions\ncan be used to hide away details.\n\n250\n00:13:03.607 --> 00:13:08.063\nI'm doing a hyper-version of it, right?\n\n251\n00:13:08.063 --> 00:13:10.120\nYou don't have to do this for everything.\n\n252\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.890\nIf you wanna leave the print_rules(),\nthat's perfectly fine, if you wanna leave\n\n253\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.460\nthe clear_screen() and only remove\nthe print_rules(), that's perfectly fines,\n\n254\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:24.020\nkinda comes with a give and take, so\nI was like, let's just be explicit.\n\n255\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.922\nSo wait_for_user.\n\n256\n00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:28.842\nWe should probably test, as always.\n\n257\n00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:32.997\nSo python3 main.py.\n\n258\n00:13:32.997 --> 00:13:35.450\nWait_for_user.\n\n259\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.420\nThat's syntax error.\n\n260\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.410\nHave another syntax error.\n\n261\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.320\nInvalid syntax and\n\n262\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.930\nit says, this line what_for_user, and\nnotice the points at the parenthesis.\n\n263\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.820\nLet's scroll up and we look, and\n\n264\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.400\nanytime you have two functions\nother than the name,\n\n265\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.560\ncompare an existing function that you know\nthat works, and the one you just wrote.\n\n266\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.040\nSo if I look for\ndev wait_for_users(), dev game():.\n\n267\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.757\nI forgot the colon.\n\n268\n00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:08.900\nNow, if those look exactly the same,\nyou apply the same rules.\n\n269\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.550\nGo look at the lines above, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.793\nSo then now, let's try it again.\n\n271\n00:14:14.793 --> 00:14:15.647\nLooks good.\n\n272\n00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:18.136\nAnd my guess is 50, too low.\n\n273\n00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:19.936\n75, too low.\n\n274\n00:14:19.936 --> 00:14:21.920\n87, too low.\n\n275\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.360\n95, too low, 98, too low.\n\n276\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.476\n99, too low.\n\n277\n00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:28.610\n100, yay.\n\n278\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.750\nSo come on, that is like a worst\npossible scenario, right?\n\n279\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.740\nFor the given strategy.\n\n280\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.510\nBut everything still works.\n\n281\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.510\nNow we come to this last little bit.\n\n282\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.450\nSee this guess?\n\n283\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.170\nSo let's think about what's\nhappening in these two lines.\n\n284\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.870\nWe take in a guess from a user and\n\n285\n00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:53.500\nthen we change it to guess as a number or\nwe say make it an integer.\n\n286\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.488\nThat failure that we saw is actually\na result of this thing, all right, so\n\n287\n00:14:58.488 --> 00:15:01.750\nguess is a number equals int guess.\n\n288\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.305\nOkay, well, what does that mean?\n\n289\n00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:09.225\nThat means that if I put anything\nin here that is not changeable and\n\n290\n00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:14.159\ncastable, convertible to an integer\nthen it fails, all right?\n\n291\n00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:19.002\nI would rather have it explicitly fail so\nI know about it then kinda go well you put\n\n292\n00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:22.272\nan A in there, so\nwe assume that you mean an I, right?\n\n293\n00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:23.640\nSo that would be kinda weird.\n\n294\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.735\nBut I wanna abstract this away because I\nhad to make up a new variable name and\n\n295\n00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:29.685\nreally it should just be the guess,\n\n296\n00:15:29.685 --> 00:15:34.506\nI shouldn't have to worry about what's\nthe guess, then it's a guess is a number.\n\n297\n00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:37.722\nSo we're gonna make\na couple of changes here.\n\n298\n00:15:37.722 --> 00:15:43.860\nAnd I'm going to make a function\ncalled \"get_guess();\" and\n\n299\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:50.560\nwhat we're doing is we're going to\ngrab this and we're going to paste.\n\n300\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.818\nAnd all I did there was hold Shift and\nhit Tab, I will Tab left.\n\n301\n00:15:56.818 --> 00:15:57.850\nI'm gonna \"return\".\n\n302\n00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.200\nGuess as a number.\n\n303\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.270\nNow, what that means is instead of\nhaving guess_as_number here, I'm going\n\n304\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.980\nto say that guess is gonna be whatever\ncomes from the get_guess function.\n\n305\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.590\nOkay, so I'm gonna say call and get_guess.\n\n306\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.930\nIt's going to ask for user input.\n\n307\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.990\nIt's gonna transform it to a number and\n\n308\n00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.310\nthen it's going to give\nme that value back.\n\n309\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.720\nBut now,\nI don't have to worry about those details.\n\n310\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.710\nIn addition to I could add some error\nhandling if I needed to, right?\n\n311\n00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.520\nI would probably have to put some more\nlogic here that handle that appropriately,\n\n312\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.650\nbut that's okay.\n\n313\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.050\nWhat that also means is I\ndon't need guess_as_number.\n\n314\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.890\nI need guess and guess.\n\n315\n00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.450\nThat's a little easier to, and I go, well\nwhy do we have guess_as_number and guess.\n\n316\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.610\nWe just have a guess, all right?\n\n317\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:52.699\nYou made a guess and there's some stuff\nthat happens in order to accomplish that.\n\n318\n00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:56.000\nI say if the guess is greater\nthan the number, too high.\n\n319\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.280\nIf the guess is less than the number to\nguess, too low, otherwise you win, right?\n\n320\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.590\nSo if we come back through here and\n\n321\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.560\nwe look, we had all of this\ninternal to this game function, but\n\n322\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.410\nnow we get clear screen, print the title,\nprint the rules, wait for user, right?\n\n323\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.345\nLet me clear this screen again and\n\n324\n00:17:15.345 --> 00:17:20.194\nthen we assign the number to guess to some\nwhere in he integer between 1 and 100.\n\n325\n00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:22.628\nAnd then we go into the loop.\n\n326\n00:17:22.628 --> 00:17:26.460\nAnd then for each low,\nwe get a new guess, right?\n\n327\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.537\nSo using get guess, and after guess\nis greater than the number to get,\n\n328\n00:17:30.537 --> 00:17:35.370\ntoo high, if the guess is less than the\nnumber to guess, too low, and then, well,\n\n329\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.570\notherwise you win.\n\n330\n00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.730\nNow by doing this,\nI could, if I wanted to,\n\n331\n00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.198\nI could do things like clear\nscreen after each guess.\n\n332\n00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:50.410\nOr I could wait_for_user.\n\n333\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.630\nNow, as it stands,\nthis wait_for_user is very specific.\n\n334\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.950\nRight, so\nwe would have to change that a little bit.\n\n335\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.820\nBut using these functions, I argue,\n\n336\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.500\nthat there's a little nicer readability\nif I come back to this a month from now.\n\n337\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.730\nOkay so the game I'm going to clear the\nscreen, print the title, print the rules.\n\n338\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.480\nAnd now my intentions\nare a little more explicit.\n\n339\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.370\nAgain, as you continue your journey,\n\n340\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:24.000\nyou may find that it's a very hyper\nversion of this creating functions.\n\n341\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.790\nYou don't always have to do this.\n\n342\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.324\nBut you should be aware that it can\nmake things a great deal more readable,\n\n343\n00:18:29.324 --> 00:18:31.060\na lot more maintainable.\n\n344\n00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.300\nSome of our functions are very specific.\n\n345\n00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.610\nI can just print the rules,\nprint the title.\n\n346\n00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:44.000\nOne could argue that maybe it's just\nas good to keep those, right, in line.\n\n347\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.429\nSo tomato, tomato.\n\n348\n00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:49.939\n&gt;&gt; So if we come over here,\nlet's make sure our final little bit.\n\n349\n00:18:49.939 --> 00:18:50.750\nHere are the numbers.\n\n350\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm ready.\n\n351\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.209\nAll right, so we're gonna guess 50.\n\n352\n00:18:53.209 --> 00:18:54.231\nThat's too low.\n\n353\n00:18:54.231 --> 00:18:56.046\n75, too low.\n\n354\n00:18:56.046 --> 00:18:57.822\n87, too low.\n\n355\n00:18:57.822 --> 00:18:59.862\n95, too high.\n\n356\n00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:01.148\n92, too low.\n\n357\n00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:03.901\n93, too low.\n\n358\n00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:07.300\n94, so it was 94.\n\n359\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.140\nKind of interesting however, everything\nis a little nicer, a little prettier.\n\n360\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.527\nBut I kind of get to play till I win.\n\n361\n00:19:15.527 --> 00:19:19.540\n[LAUGH] Maybe long term that's\nnot an actual game dynamic.\n\n362\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.660\n&gt;&gt; I see where you're going with this.\n\n363\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.630\n&gt;&gt; What's the purpose in playing\na game if you can't lose?\n\n364\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n365\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.690\n&gt;&gt; And some people would argue,\n\n366\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.520\nwell the best kind of games\nare the ones you always win at.\n\n367\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.920\nI would argue that it's not\nreally a game if you can't lose.\n\n368\n00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.600\n&gt;&gt; There has to be a challenge, Justin.\n\n369\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.570\nWe have to put a challenge in here.\n\n370\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.690\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly right, Zach.\n\n371\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.210\nBut now that we have\nsome things cleaned up,\n\n372\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.200\nwe have a little nicer pallete to look at.\n\n373\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.040\nI think we should probably move forward\nand add a little bit of those features\n\n374\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.810\nthat we saw during our planning\nphase Where we think about, okay?\n\n375\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.460\nWell, we have maximum guesses and\nwe want to stop because we\n\n376\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.220\nhave convinced that code adding those\nfeatures should be a little easier.\n\n377\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.430\nYou may find that refactoring to\na function was a little premature and\n\n378\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.280\nthat happens sometimes.\n\n379\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.020\nAnd what I mean by premature is you'd\nplot an abstraction prematurely.\n\n380\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.460\nAnd it makes adding\nfeatures more difficult.\n\n381\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.430\nSo that's another thing you always\nhave to be worried about when you\n\n382\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.480\njust start putting functions\neverywhere and pulling things out.\n\n383\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.670\nIs you may end up finding that, I gotta\nundo that in order to do this thing.\n\n384\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.370\nAnd then really the function changes.\n\n385\n00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.220\nBut that's where we are,\nwe refactored the functions.\n\n386\n00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.650\nBut we have a few features to add,\nso that's where we are, Zach.\n\n387\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Well this has been a wonderful episode.\n\n388\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.010\nWe factored a funtion.\n\n389\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.100\nJustin, well done.\n\n390\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.590\nBefore we move on,\n\n391\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.710\nyou have this look in your eye that\nyou would like to say something else.\n\n392\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.829\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that look is,\nI have a craving for cheese now.\n\n393\n00:20:41.829 --> 00:20:43.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I jest.\n\n394\n00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:46.840\nIt is always keep things in context.\n\n395\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.290\nThe goal here is to\n\n396\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.055\nhelp you get more comfortable in\napplying new skills that you've learned.\n\n397\n00:20:53.055 --> 00:20:54.906\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but keep in mind,\n\n398\n00:20:54.906 --> 00:20:59.470\ndifferent themes, different individuals\nmay have different perspectives.\n\n399\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.270\nYou may find things that\nwork a little better for\n\n400\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:06.170\nyou and as long they're maintable and\nreproducable.\n\n401\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:10.510\nAnd they're not like convoluted, then\nyou may find your own approach, right?\n\n402\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.250\nProgramming is a written language.\n\n403\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:17.130\nAnd we all end up with our own\nlittle voices, so to speak.\n\n404\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:22.570\nAs long as everybody can agree\nthat your voice is approachable,\n\n405\n00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.530\nthen don't be afraid to do that.\n\n406\n00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.970\nSo that's kind of the takeaway here,\nand this is how I would do things.\n\n407\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.340\nAnd then six months from now,\n\n408\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.850\nI may do things a little bit\ndifferent because I've learned more.\n\n409\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.040\nAnd ultimately, that's a goal.\n\n410\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.890\nKeep learning so you are always getting\nbetter than you were yesterday.\n\n411\n00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.796\n&gt;&gt; Very well said sir.\n\n412\n00:21:40.796 --> 00:21:42.350\nSo applied fundementals.\n\n413\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.910\nGuess the number will continue.\n\n414\n00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.200\nThere is a lot of episodes.\n\n415\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.488\nMake sure you see them all.\n\n416\n00:21:46.488 --> 00:21:47.413\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n417\n00:21:47.413 --> 00:21:50.190\nAnd while you are in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos and\n\n418\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.570\nthey're all designed to do one thing.\n\n419\n00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.620\nTo help you go further, so\ncheck those out, as well.\n\n420\n00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.380\nAnd thank you for watching

I'm gonna try my best and hopefully we\ncan make this an expeditious endeavor.\n\n8\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.750\n&gt;&gt; Expeditious.\n&gt;&gt; Is that technically, yeah,\n\n9\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.050\nI think that's alliteration.\n\n10\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.700\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n11\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, right?\n\n12\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.075\nThat means we're gonna\ntry to do it quickly.\n\n13\n00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:46.430\n[LAUGH] So let's think about\nwhere we kind of are, right?\n\n14\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.290\nAs it stands I can always play\nthis respective game until I win.\n\n15\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.335\nNow the choice of the loosing\nconditions can be,\n\n16\n00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:58.280\nyou can make a game too hard, right?\n\n17\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.215\nAnd if you don't believe me,\nthen go to, Mega Man 2.\n\n18\n00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:05.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go play Mega Man 2.\n\n19\n00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:10.920\n[LAUGH] And you, it's too hard,\ncan I throw it back there.\n\n20\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.330\n&gt;&gt; Retroback.\n\n21\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.150\n&gt;&gt; Now, the only way that we\ncan kind of figure that out is,\n\n22\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.990\nif we have a capability of limiting\nthe guesses to where we lose.\n\n23\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.080\nOr to some extent, if we quit, we\n\n24\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.810\nmay not get to all of that, we'll get to\na starting point, because there's a little\n\n25\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.600\nbit of set up that we're going to have\nto do as we think about these futures.\n\n26\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.620\nAnd I'm going to take you through those.\n\n27\n00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.900\nThen we're going to kind of think\nabout what we need to accomplish.\n\n28\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.720\nAnd see kind of what needs to happen,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.890\nAnd we may have to add a couple\nof features kind of in set up for\n\n30\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.410\nthis restructuring of our application.\n\n31\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.740\nSo I'm talking in grandiose manners,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.650\nYeah, Justin, that sounds amazing,\nwhatever you're talking about.\n\n33\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.140\nI think it's better to have a discussion,\nlook at the code,\n\n34\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.470\nand see how that plays out.\n\n35\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n36\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.960\nlook at the screen here.\n\n37\n00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.390\nAnd if we come over here,\nand I look, right?\n\n38\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.370\nRight now as while true,\nIf I look through here,\n\n39\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.550\nI'm just getting the guesses and\nI'm going forever.\n\n40\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.340\nNumber one, we don't have any way for\nsomeone to quit, right?\n\n41\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.929\nRather than hitting CTRL+C.\n\n42\n00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.740\n&gt;&gt; So technically,\nthat should end the game.\n\n44\n00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.310\nIn addition too, this is always running,\nhow do I end the game?\n\n45\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.910\nThat's interesting.\n\n46\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.760\nWe'll have to deal with that.\n\n47\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.080\nNumber two, the only thing that\nends the game is this break.\n\n48\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.480\nThere's no way, as it stands, other than\njust, I'm gonna have breaks everywhere.\n\n49\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.573\nWhenever you have this, it may be better\nto have that piece of information,\n\n50\n00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:55.949\nthat piece of data, that piece\nof state about your application.\n\n51\n00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.494\nIt is saved in a variable of some sort.\n\n52\n00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:03.450\nOr maybe it's a function call\nthat evaluates some criteria.\n\n53\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.670\nSo what I'm thinking is\ninstead of while true,\n\n54\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.070\nthis should be running as long\nas something is true, right?\n\n55\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.740\nLike maybe we are running.\n\n56\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.350\nMaybe we are still playing.\n\n57\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.500\nSomething of that nature.\n\n58\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.680\nAnd the reason that I wanna do that,\nis if we have the ability for\n\n59\n00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.390\nthe user to quit,\nto determine whether they're not running,\n\n60\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.100\nthen it sets us up to also modify that\nsame thing for a losing condition.\n\n61\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.630\nWe've exceeded max guesses, all right?\n\n62\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.060\nSo, we're, this is a kind of\nan organic kind of feel, right?\n\n63\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.510\nNow, we're going to take a look and\n\n64\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.790\nI'm going to take a little\nbit different bent here.\n\n65\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.580\nBecause we could use global variables and\n\n66\n00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.620\nyou have to do some weirdness unless you\norganize them in a particular manner.\n\n67\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.900\nAnd I'm going to show you that.\n\n68\n00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.600\nSo I think the first thing\nthat we need to do is\n\n69\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.600\nwhat are we going to try to accomplish?\n\n70\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.460\nRight?\n\n71\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.770\nAnd this may be in preparation for,\nlet's see.\n\n72\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.870\nSo this is number five and\nwe're going to add the following features\n\n73\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.810\nin order to limit the number of maximum or\nthe maximum number of guesses.\n\n74\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.558\nThe maximum number of guesses,\nnumber of guesses.\n\n75\n00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:34.024\nAnd this is, I thought about this so\n\n76\n00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:38.230\nit's gonna take a little bit\nlonger than these two minutes.\n\n77\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.490\nWe're [INAUDIBLE] things\nthat we're gonna do.\n\n78\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.690\nSo if you're trying to build something,\n\n79\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.380\nthis is gonna take you a little longer,\nright, magic of television so to speak.\n\n80\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n81\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.960\n&gt;&gt; So I want, so we're going to\n\n82\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.340\nallow the user to press q to quit.\n\n83\n00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:01.707\nOkay, so if we can quit,\nwe can modify that same state, and\n\n84\n00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:03.520\nkinda cut things off, right?\n\n85\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.320\n&gt;&gt; And because we're adding something,\nwhere's this gonna live?\n\n87\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.060\nHere's what I'm thinking, the get_guess,\nwhoa, that glitched on me a little bit.\n\n88\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.680\nThis good guess is very simple.\n\n89\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.840\nBut we've talked about error handling, and\nI put a cue in right now, this breaks.\n\n90\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.070\nSo I might have to put it there.\n\n91\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.230\nThis is where I was talking about some of\nthat premature factoring or abstraction.\n\n92\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.170\nIf I waited until later to go, well, wait\na minute, I might keep these separate.\n\n93\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.540\nBut we've already made,\nwe've committed to this path.\n\n94\n00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.330\nIt's okay to see it to the end.\n\n95\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.960\nWe can always come back and redo it.\n\n96\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.260\nIt's not a large scope.\n\n97\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.374\nSo add some error handling, To\n\n98\n00:05:46.374 --> 00:05:52.570\nthe get_guess function, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.670\nAnd, let's see,\nwe need to change the game loop.\n\n100\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.220\nNow, what game loop am I talking about?\n\n101\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.416\nI'm talking about that while\nloop to use shared state to\n\n102\n00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:14.880\ndetermine, If it is still running.\n\n103\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.570\n&gt;&gt; So Justin, are you going to\nchoose the number of tries or\n\n104\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.240\nguesses or is it going to create\nits own number of guesses?\n\n105\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Here's what I'm thinking.\n\n106\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.600\nI think, for now,\nwe're just gonna hard code.\n\n107\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.270\nWe're going to choose what\nthe guesses are, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna save those in\n\n109\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.090\na global variable, and\n\n110\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.500\nuse a name convention, and we're\nprobably going to keep things grouped.\n\n111\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.590\nSo as it stands,\nI don't have any global variables.\n\n112\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.610\nNow, what do I mean by global?\n\n113\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.700\nI mean global to this module.\n\n114\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.230\nI don't know where I'm going.\n\n115\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.530\nSo I have all these functions,\nI have these imports.\n\n116\n00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.880\nBut I don't have any variables that live\noutside the functions that can be used in\n\n117\n00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.010\nvarious other functions.\n\n118\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.100\nYou've watched the hangman series,\nI've done that.\n\n119\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.730\nNow what I'm gonna do is use a pattern.\n\n120\n00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.370\nLike this number to guess, really,\nI could make that a global variable.\n\n121\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.640\nSo I may kind of pull those together,\n\n122\n00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.630\nbecause max number of guesses should\nalso be a constant based on difficulty.\n\n123\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.250\nI'm gonna hard code it initially, but a\npossible feature we could implement after\n\n124\n00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.380\nthis, is have the user\nchoose a difficulty.\n\n125\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.090\n&gt;&gt; A level of difficulty.\n\n126\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.682\n&gt;&gt; Where you go like max number of\nguesses is based on do you want easy,\n\n127\n00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:24.590\nmedium, yeah.\n\n128\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.300\n&gt;&gt; Hard, medium.\n\n129\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if it's hard, you get three\nguesses which actually if it's a 1 to 100,\n\n130\n00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.470\nit's pretty much impossible,\nit's just by chance in all honesty,\n\n131\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.260\nunless you create some kind\nof optimized strategy or\n\n132\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.510\nyou can figure out how the computers\nare assigning random numbers.\n\n133\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.625\nAnd then may be easy is\nyou get 20 guesses, right?\n\n134\n00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:50.110\n20 guesses, you probably, you should\nbe able to win, eventually, right?\n\n135\n00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.350\nThere may be some flukes.\n\n136\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.250\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking more like ten.\n\n137\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.894\n&gt;&gt; Ten?\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n\n138\n00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:57.094\n&gt;&gt; You could probably still win there so\nthat could be easy, but\n\n139\n00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.000\nbefore we worry about any\nof that difficulty picking.\n\n140\n00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.700\nWe need just to be able\nto set a limitation.\n\n141\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.390\nRight on, right?\n\n142\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.060\nSo in order to do that, so we need to\nchange the game loop to use shear state\n\n143\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.950\ndetermine if it is still running.\n\n144\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:17.290\nAnd then we need to reorganize the,\n\n145\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.850\nand I wanna call these\nthe variables that are reused\n\n146\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.140\nto kinda global in nature.\n\n147\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.800\nI mean,\nglobal in the sense of this main.py file.\n\n148\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.140\nAll right, so how am I gonna do that?\n\n149\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.640\nI say right now we just kinda,\nwe start with this,\n\n150\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.090\nbecause in order to quit,\nwe're probably gonna have to modify state.\n\n151\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.810\nRight, if we want to add\nsome error handling,\n\n152\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.750\nokay, well,\nwe're gonna be in that same place.\n\n153\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.579\nSo let's change the state.\n\n154\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.730\nAnd I'm gonna use a trick\nto keep us from having\n\n155\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.380\nto add all these weird keywords and stuff.\n\n156\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.300\nAll right, so I'm gonna come to the top,\nand I'm gonna add a comment and\n\n157\n00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.840\nsay shared state (BE CAREFUL).\n\n158\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.430\nRight, now, what do I mean by be careful?\n\n159\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.750\nYou can actually do things that,\ndo not make a whole lot of sense.\n\n160\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.230\nBut I'm actually just gonna call it\nstate and it's gonna be a dictionary.\n\n161\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.700\nAnd I'm gonna add\na running property as such.\n\n162\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.790\nAnd by default, I'm gonna set it to true.\n\n163\n00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.335\nAll right, so state running is true.\n\n164\n00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:36.317\nNow, what's going to happen is long term,\nI think,\n\n165\n00:09:36.317 --> 00:09:39.515\nas certain things happen I'm\ngoing to set that to false.\n\n166\n00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:42.100\nAnd then,\nthat kind of just takes care of itself.\n\n167\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n168\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n169\n00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:49.790\nNow, [COUGH] after I get that,\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n170\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:56.040\nAnd this while true, I'm just going\nto say state running like that.\n\n171\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.350\nSo I changed that true to state running.\n\n172\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.960\nNow this is a shared piece of information\n\n173\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.660\nthat I can modify that will affect\nwhether the while loop is running or not.\n\n174\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.910\nOkay so we probably have to add a little\nbit of logic, but that's all right.\n\n175\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.270\nAnd we're good to go, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:22.425\nNow, let's test it and\nsee if everything is good to go here.\n\n177\n00:10:22.425 --> 00:10:24.213\nSo looks good.\n\n178\n00:10:24.213 --> 00:10:25.367\nWhat's your guess?\n\n179\n00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:27.563\n50.\n\n180\n00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:31.947\nOkay, so now we've modified\nto use that shared state.\n\n181\n00:10:31.947 --> 00:10:35.050\nWe're gonna see that this is, just gonna\nchange a little bit as I continue.\n\n182\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.127\nBut I'm gonna kill this.\n\n183\n00:10:38.127 --> 00:10:39.564\nToo far, too far.\n\n184\n00:10:39.564 --> 00:10:42.120\nSo I've just changed this\nto have state running.\n\n185\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.632\nSo it's the state of the game.\n\n186\n00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:46.126\nWhen I start the game, this is running.\n\n187\n00:10:46.126 --> 00:10:51.189\nNow, before I go too much further,\nI've kind of achieved this.\n\n188\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.240\nI'm gonna reorganize the variables.\n\n189\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.810\nI'm gonna go ahead and pull this number\nto guess out to a global variable.\n\n190\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.612\nTechnically state is global but let's call\nthese global configuration variables.\n\n191\n00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:11.410\nAnd I'm gonna grab this, cut it.\n\n192\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.800\nAnd there we go.\n\n193\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.020\nSo, as it stands, I've just moved\nthat outside of that function, and\n\n194\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.970\nthen the number to guess is still\navailable inside that function.\n\n195\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.750\nIt's not gonna be easy\nto change it though.\n\n196\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.910\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n197\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.960\nLet's double check.\n\n198\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.890\nUltimately there is gonna be another\nglobal configuration variable,\n\n199\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.290\na max number of guesses.\n\n200\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.397\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n201\n00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:38.743\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here, looks good.\n\n202\n00:11:38.743 --> 00:11:43.431\n50, too low, 75 looks like our rand int\n\n203\n00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:48.762\nfunction has a bent towards\nnear the upper range.\n\n204\n00:11:48.762 --> 00:11:52.573\nI know there'd be something that\nwe would have to figure out right.\n\n205\n00:11:52.573 --> 00:11:58.840\nSo too low, 87, too high,\n84, too high, 83.\n\n206\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.370\nSo notice, I did that in five tracks.\n\n207\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.160\nRight.\n\n208\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.410\nSo maybe, five, you would have to have the\noptimum strategy to win in five or six.\n\n209\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So just by playing the game we\n\n210\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.890\nkind of understand\nthe difficulty that can crop up.\n\n211\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.740\nSo I have this while state running.\n\n212\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.960\nI get_guess.\n\n213\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.050\nI've extracted these to globals.\n\n214\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:24.825\nAnd now I think we should have the ability\nto allow the user to press q to quit.\n\n215\n00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:28.160\nAdd some error handling, and\n\n216\n00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.490\nto some extent that´s gonna\ngive us some validation there.\n\n217\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.911\nSo inside of this get_guess, so\n\n218\n00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:40.610\nour get_guess function is called\nevery time we're looping.\n\n219\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.110\nSo here we go.\n\n220\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.470\nAnd we'll probably gonna\nhave to modify this logic.\n\n221\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:53.560\nBut let say that get_guess,\nwe have, what is your guess.\n\n222\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.630\nAnd then if guess lower\n\n223\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.190\nequals q, then what do I wanna do?\n\n224\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:10.840\nI wanna say state running equals false,\n\n225\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.790\nI'm gonna modify the running state okay?\n\n226\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.700\nSo let's see how that plays out okay?\n\n227\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.204\nI think we're gonna end up with\nsome interesting issues here.\n\n228\n00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:27.840\nSo python3 main.py.\n\n229\n00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.260\nAnd it say when you're ready\npress any key to continue okay.\n\n230\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.380\nI'm ready and I'm gonna hit Q and\ninvalid literal for int.\n\n231\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.878\nNow, did that happen?\n\n232\n00:13:37.878 --> 00:13:44.200\nBecause I said, allow users to quit, but\nwe're gonna have to add some air handling.\n\n233\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.940\nWell, if I put q into this int,\nstuff is broke.\n\n234\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.807\n&gt;&gt; So we need to go ahead and\nadd a little bit of air handling here.\n\n235\n00:13:52.807 --> 00:13:54.785\nSo I'm gonna try this.\n\n236\n00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:03.135\nExcept, and I always forget the exception.\n\n237\n00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:03.635\nValue, yeah.\n\n238\n00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:06.285\nSo see this value here?\n\n239\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.385\nI want to catch, right?\n\n240\n00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:11.840\nLook for a particular value here.\n\n241\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.220\nAs the E I may end up logging that.\n\n242\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.000\nAnd all I'm going to do is say print.\n\n243\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:24.228\nPlease make sure that you\nare typing a value number or\n\n244\n00:14:24.228 --> 00:14:28.290\n[Q] to quit.\n\n245\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.370\nOkay, and\nthen I'm gonna do something slick here.\n\n246\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.050\nI'm gonna return get_gas.\n\n247\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.370\nEffectively, I'm gonna\nstart back at the top.\n\n248\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.900\n&gt;&gt; So what this is gonna do is I call\na function in of itself, inside of itself.\n\n249\n00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:50.020\nIf they do something they're not supposed\nto, I'm gonna say, hey, you shouldn't.\n\n250\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:54.770\nShouldn't be doing that return\nget_guest because up here\n\n251\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.280\ngrabs the guest and\nthen it comes back through.\n\n252\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.580\nSo it will kind of loop,\nso to speak until either,\n\n253\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.470\nuntil this actually works, okay?\n\n254\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.948\nSo let's come back,\nsee how that plays out.\n\n255\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.380\nAbout messed up there.\n\n256\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.270\nSo good, let's hit Q.\n\n257\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.886\nOkay, please make sure that you,\n\n258\n00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:26.584\nwell, that you are typing.\n\n259\n00:15:29.953 --> 00:15:31.123\nA valid number?\n\n260\n00:15:31.123 --> 00:15:32.807\nWow Zach.\n\n261\n00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:38.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n262\n00:15:38.382 --> 00:15:40.033\nWhy won't that work?\n\n263\n00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:46.169\nWe're not quite getting what we want,\nand that's because,\n\n264\n00:15:46.169 --> 00:15:52.671\ndo I really want to I really want\nto try this if someone has typed q?\n\n265\n00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:55.355\nActually, I wanna return.\n\n266\n00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:59.009\nAnd let's just return none or\nwe can just leave it as return so\n\n267\n00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:00.809\nit implicitly returns none.\n\n268\n00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:03.028\nSo I'm gonna return from this function.\n\n269\n00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:07.610\nSo this get gas function down here,\nit's still just get gas.\n\n270\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.136\nUp here though,\nit has increased in complexity.\n\n271\n00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:14.860\nIf gas.lower = q, state running false.\n\n272\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.770\nAnd then I'm just gonna return.\n\n273\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.580\nSo I'm gonna stop.\n\n274\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.870\nI don't wanna try to\ncast it to an integer.\n\n275\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.309\nIf that's not true, then I'm gonna try\nto get it as a number and return it.\n\n276\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.040\nMaybe someone types a or\nhit enter or something like that, so\n\n277\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.750\nwe're gonna say please make sure\nthat you're typing a valid number or\n\n278\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.220\nQ to quit and then it's gonna ask them for\na guess again.\n\n279\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.205\nNow, we're gonna get into some issues here\nbecause I don't think this should count\n\n280\n00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:41.979\nagainst them, as part of their\nmaximum number of guesses.\n\n281\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.570\nOnly if the successfully type in\na guess should account against them.\n\n282\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.040\nSo yeah, that's my assumption here.\n\n283\n00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.440\nLet's go see if this actually works Zack.\n\n284\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.676\nSo there we go,\nkeyboard interrupt, beautiful.\n\n285\n00:16:55.676 --> 00:16:59.242\nAll right, done, q\n\n286\n00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:06.147\nGreater than not supported between\ninstances of none type and int.\n\n287\n00:17:07.734 --> 00:17:12.240\nSo trying to fix another error\ncaused this error, all right?\n\n288\n00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.300\nWhere did that come from?\n\n289\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.340\nWell, this looks like it's working, right?\n\n290\n00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.120\nWe still have some other\nthings to test there.\n\n291\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.980\nBut if we come here, if guess is\ngreater than the number of guess,\n\n292\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.390\nwell I can't compare a none and\nthe number to guess.\n\n293\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.410\nSo what I'm thinking is right here, if\n\n294\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.950\nguess is none,\nwhat does that imply based on our logic?\n\n295\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:49.210\nWell, we actually wanna skip,\nright, to the next one.\n\n296\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.070\nSo we just wanna continue.\n\n297\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.270\nI'm gonna continue the loop but\nI don't wanna do any of the rest of this.\n\n298\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.100\nI wanna go, okay, hop back up here.\n\n299\n00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.790\nBut ideally and this is where this\nmutable shared state gets weird.\n\n300\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.130\nYou have to think of a couple\nplaces at the same time.\n\n301\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:11.491\nI've set this state running to false,\nso now this wild loop should stop.\n\n302\n00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:15.218\nAll right and just quit, all right?\n\n303\n00:18:15.218 --> 00:18:18.130\nSo, that's kind of this\nintermingled logic.\n\n304\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.920\nLet's see if places out\nlike we anticipated to.\n\n305\n00:18:21.998 --> 00:18:26.840\nBoom, q and\nnow we have the ability to quit.\n\n306\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.890\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n307\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.200\n&gt;&gt; And now if we come here and\nwe say are you ready to play?\n\n308\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.860\nSure, I hit an a, please make sure you\nare typing a valid number q to quit and\n\n309\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.956\nthen I ask for my guess.\n\n310\n00:18:36.956 --> 00:18:40.208\nOkay, awesome.\n\n311\n00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:42.640\nWhat is your guess?\n\n312\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.470\nWell, what I'm thinking is maybe 50.\n\n313\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.252\nToo low.\n\n314\n00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:48.432\n75, too high.\n\n315\n00:18:48.432 --> 00:18:50.991\n63, too low.\n\n316\n00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:53.386\n69, too low.\n\n317\n00:18:53.386 --> 00:18:55.716\n72, too low.\n\n318\n00:18:55.716 --> 00:18:59.915\n73, 74, and notice I got it\nin five times last time but\n\n319\n00:18:59.915 --> 00:19:02.680\nthis time it took a little bit longer.\n\n320\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.870\nSo we have kind of all\nthese pieces in place,\n\n321\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.290\nnow we can actually talk\nabout limiting the guesses.\n\n322\n00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.250\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n323\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.272\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's get that set up and\n\n324\n00:19:12.272 --> 00:19:15.040\nour modification of logic\nmay actually have to wait.\n\n325\n00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.370\nBut what have we changed thus far?\n\n326\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.460\nThis get_guess has gotten\na lot more complicated.\n\n327\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.350\nIf it's a queue and\nI compare lowercase to lowercase,\n\n328\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.780\nthat way I don't have to worry\nabout them typing uppercase or\n\n329\n00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.780\nwhatever it may be, set the state\nrunning to false and a return.\n\n330\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.800\nTry, set it as a number.\n\n331\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.550\nReturn it.\n\n332\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.300\nIf that doesn't work,\nprint out a message to them and\n\n333\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.520\nsay, hey, you need to make\nsure you do this correctly.\n\n334\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.000\nAnd then ask them for the next guess.\n\n335\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:47.249\nSince this function never returns\nuntil this kind of loop finishes,\n\n336\n00:19:47.249 --> 00:19:53.021\nI will never get to this logic until I\nget something back from get guess, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:58.635\nIf the guess is none, that means they\ntyped Q and this running state, well\n\n338\n00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:05.082\nit doesn't seem like it's necessary here\nbecause technically I could just break.\n\n339\n00:20:05.082 --> 00:20:09.096\nBut if I continue, I wanted to test to\nsee if that state running false if that\n\n340\n00:20:09.096 --> 00:20:10.520\nactually quits the loop.\n\n341\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.960\nIt does.\n\n342\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.240\nAnd so this just short circuits\nthe rest of this logic\n\n343\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.820\ncuz I can't compare none to numbers.\n\n344\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.700\nOtherwise, the guess still works,\n\n345\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.550\nas we've just seen and\neverything else stays in place.\n\n346\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.630\nBut now, now, let's see here.\n\n347\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.970\nWhat do we have?\n\n348\n00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:36.270\nWe can get a guess and well,\nwe need another piece of state.\n\n349\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:42.170\nWe need to know how many guesses\nhave been, well, guessed, right?\n\n350\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.090\nSo, let's see here.\n\n351\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.590\nWait for it.\n\n352\n00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.440\nLet's say total guesses.\n\n353\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.790\nAnd I can technically put these in\nvariables and not in a dictionary but\n\n354\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.370\nI'm putting all of these together\nbecause I'm saying that knowing if it's\n\n355\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.650\nin a running state and knowing\nthe total number of guesses are both\n\n356\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.980\npieces of information that I need to know\nabout whether to continue the game, right?\n\n357\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.920\nSo, total guess,\nit starts at 0 cuz you have guess 0 times.\n\n358\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.610\nAnd then here, let's call this\n\n359\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:27.500\nMAX_GUESSES = let's go with 10.\n\n360\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.160\nWe'll go with Zach's recommendation.\n\n361\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.550\nBut now the question is and\n\n362\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.810\nI just put this there because I\nknow we need to set a limitation.\n\n363\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.540\nWe may not use this right now.\n\n364\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.410\nThe total guest list,\nlet's look at some error handling.\n\n365\n00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:48.210\nWait, notice that this doesn't, we haven't\nactually talked about this part, right?\n\n366\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:54.173\nSo, let's come back and add to our list\n\n367\n00:21:54.173 --> 00:21:59.416\ncuz these are sometimes fluent and\n\n368\n00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:05.021\ndetermine or create total guesses,\n\n369\n00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:12.433\nshare state and\ndetermine when a guess counts and\n\n370\n00:22:12.433 --> 00:22:16.440\na little sub-note here.\n\n371\n00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.846\nIncrement the total guesses,\n\n372\n00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:30.487\nstate, when a user successfully guesses.\n\n373\n00:22:30.487 --> 00:22:33.933\nNow, Zack, I'm writing this,\nso I know what I mean, but I'm\n\n374\n00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:38.573\ngonna rely on you to tell me if, are there\nany parts of that that doesn't make sense?\n\n375\n00:22:38.573 --> 00:22:44.673\n&gt;&gt; Why would you put an underscore\nbefore guesses on the last line?\n\n376\n00:22:44.673 --> 00:22:45.614\n&gt;&gt; Here?\n\n377\n00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, total_guesses.\n\n378\n00:22:47.862 --> 00:22:51.930\n&gt;&gt; So, increment the total_guesses.\n\n379\n00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:57.689\nActually, that should be\ntotal_guesses shared state and\n\n380\n00:22:57.689 --> 00:23:02.123\nI'm just picking a variable name-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n381\n00:23:02.123 --> 00:23:04.050\n&gt;&gt; For this attribute property.\n\n382\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n383\n00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.689\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\nname attribute [CROSSTALK]\n\n384\n00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:06.686\n&gt;&gt; But great question.\n\n385\n00:23:06.686 --> 00:23:07.509\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n386\n00:23:07.509 --> 00:23:10.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's just see if this works.\n\n387\n00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:17.878\nWhat I'm thinking is, let's just print\nstate every time we run through and\n\n388\n00:23:17.878 --> 00:23:23.030\nin all honesty,\n\n389\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:29.590\nwe should increment the guess\nevery time we go through the loop.\n\n390\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.925\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.\n\n391\n00:23:30.925 --> 00:23:35.492\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's say state total_guesses += 1, so\n\n392\n00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:41.465\nI'm gonna increment the total\nnumber of guesses every time.\n\n393\n00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:43.090\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n394\n00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:49.496\n&gt;&gt; Let's go see, python3 main.py,\nyep, what is your guess?\n\n395\n00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:50.416\n&gt;&gt; 50.\n\n396\n00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:55.460\n&gt;&gt; So running right at that point,\nI hadn't guessed anything.\n\n397\n00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.590\nI hadn't guessed anything.\n\n398\n00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.205\nIt says too low but it has this\nrunning true total guesses, all right?\n\n399\n00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:05.629\nLet's just say 75 Notice this is 1,\nnow you have to be careful,\n\n400\n00:24:05.629 --> 00:24:07.842\nwe're a little out of sync here.\n\n401\n00:24:07.842 --> 00:24:11.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because this is printing before I\n\n402\n00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:14.315\ntechnically am comparing my guesses.\n\n403\n00:24:14.315 --> 00:24:16.823\nSo at that point in time\nI have guessed 0 times,\n\n404\n00:24:16.823 --> 00:24:19.620\ncuz I haven't completed that first loop.\n\n405\n00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.260\nSo be careful about that count.\n\n406\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I was wondering why it was 0.\n\n407\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:29.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and then 2, and\nthen that is too low, let's go to 68 and\n\n408\n00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:34.888\nI won, and\nnotice the total number of guesses is 3.\n\n409\n00:24:34.888 --> 00:24:38.061\nWell 50, 75, 63, 68.\n\n410\n00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:44.190\nNow what we don't see is when this\ncompares, that's actually my fourth guess.\n\n411\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.914\nOkay 0, 1, 2, 3, so it's my fourth guess.\n\n412\n00:24:48.914 --> 00:24:51.790\nSo I think you're on to something here,\nZach.\n\n413\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.300\nBefore we move on, if we do that,\n\n414\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.610\nshould we start at 1 or\nshould we start at 0?\n\n415\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.819\nIs really what Zach's driving at,\nand that's a valid question.\n\n416\n00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:08.063\nHow that plays out depends on\nthe logic built around determining,\n\n417\n00:25:08.063 --> 00:25:11.110\nare we still playing or did we lose?\n\n418\n00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:16.390\nAll right, and we're not gonna know\nthat until we implement that logic.\n\n419\n00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.383\nSo Zach, that might take a little\nbit more time than we have.\n\n420\n00:25:19.383 --> 00:25:23.860\nAnd maybe we need to reflect about all the\nchanges we've made and kind of this setup.\n\n421\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.820\nWe have kind of our limitation of guesses,\nbut really to fully implement the limit,\n\n422\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.570\nwe need to determine whether we win or\nlose based on that limit, right?\n\n423\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.147\nSo we have a max guesses and\n\n424\n00:25:36.147 --> 00:25:41.114\nwe have a total number of guesses that\nwe've made as the application was running.\n\n425\n00:25:41.114 --> 00:25:44.890\nAnd the question is, that little bit\nof logic, where do we increment?\n\n426\n00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.140\nWhere do we create this logic?\n\n427\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:51.890\nWhat else can we do to kind of\nmake sure that limitation works?\n\n428\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.228\nAnd I can see, did we start at 0 or 1?\n\n429\n00:25:54.228 --> 00:25:57.136\nThat may take a little bit to figure out,\na little bit of trial and error.\n\n430\n00:25:57.136 --> 00:26:02.110\nSo maybe we come back for\nthat last little bit where we determine,\n\n431\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.970\nare we winning, are we losing,\nand how does this all play out?\n\n432\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.620\n&gt;&gt; Another awesome episode,\nlimit the guesses.\n\n433\n00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.494\nBy golly, rewatch it, it's awesome.\n\n434\n00:26:09.494 --> 00:26:13.182\n[LAUGH] Before we move on,\nanything else you wanna say?\n\n435\n00:26:13.182 --> 00:26:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're getting to\nalmost our final stages here.\n\n436\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.887\nAnd even though we are going to\nbe determining win and lose,\n\n437\n00:26:18.887 --> 00:26:21.186\nwe're probably gonna do\na little bit of polishing.\n\n438\n00:26:21.186 --> 00:26:24.280\nBecause I don't know if\nit'll take a full episode.\n\n439\n00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.600\nWe're probably doing\na little bit of polishing,\n\n440\n00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.930\nbecause we need to tell the user,\nyo, this is the limit you have.\n\n441\n00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.659\nAnd we need to do something where hey,\n\n442\n00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:38.538\nlet me just show you this is how\nmany times you've guessed thus far.\n\n443\n00:26:38.538 --> 00:26:39.830\nWhat's your next guess?\n\n444\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.232\nSo probably have to\nmake some tweaks there.\n\n445\n00:26:42.232 --> 00:26:44.791\nBut then we'll have our kind of\npolished finished product, so\n\n446\n00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:45.861\ndefinitely join us back.\n\n447\n00:26:45.861 --> 00:26:47.888\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Justin.\n\n448\n00:26:47.888 --> 00:26:49.392\nApplied fundamentals, guess the number.\n\n449\n00:26:49.392 --> 00:26:52.775\nMake sure you watch every single episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n450\n00:26:52.775 --> 00:26:54.075\nAnd you'll be in the course library too,\n\n451\n00:26:54.075 --> 00:26:57.295\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\nthere, designed to help you go further.\n\n452\n00:26:57.295 --> 00:26:58.469\nCheck those out as well, yeah.\n\n453\n00:26:58.469 --> 00:27:00.861\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevPro.TV,\n\n454\n00:27:00.861 --> 00:27:02.625\na good dev pro is always learning.\n\n455\n00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:03.706\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n456\n00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:04.795\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.771\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.900\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue with applied fundamentals,\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.980\nguess the number.\n\n6\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.390\nAnd in this episode,\ndetermine win or lose, [LAUGH].\n\n7\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.480\nAnd Justin Dennison's gonna\nshow us how that all works.\n\n8\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.310\nJustin, good to see you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm hoping to, I mean,\nyou've definitely promised to,\n\n10\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.510\nso I guess I'm gonna have to\nfigure out after I deliver it.\n\n11\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.360\nAnd it may not be quite as hard,\n\n12\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.168\nbut there's a few kind of edge\ncases where we have to think about.\n\n13\n00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:47.270\nLike, okay, well if we start with\nzero guesses, where do we end up?\n\n14\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.920\nAnd then, how do we determine?\n\n15\n00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.010\nThere's a few edge cases.\n\n16\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.360\nIn addition to we need to\ndo a final little polish.\n\n17\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.284\nSo, if you haven't watched the last\nepisode definitely go check that out where\n\n18\n00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:58.780\nit kinda do some setup for this one.\n\n19\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.970\nAnd in this one, well,\nwe're gonna tidy it up, put a bow on it,\n\n20\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.945\nput a stamp on it, wrap it up and\nhand it over for some festive occasion.\n\n21\n00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna do any of those things,\n\n22\n00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.760\nwe're just gonna get it done.\n\n23\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.350\nAnd well, with all good software,\nwith anything you build,\n\n24\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.650\nwe're just determining it's\ndone by some arbitrary means.\n\n25\n00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.450\nWe could probably always\ncontinue working on it.\n\n26\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.970\nAnd well, I have some things\nthat maybe you wanna try out.\n\n27\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.680\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe screen and see where we left off.\n\n28\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.500\nWe're still gonna make a plan, but\nour plan may not be too horribly detailed,\n\n29\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.370\nbecause to some extent there are times\nwhen your plan is very abstract,\n\n30\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.980\nkind of overarching but\nyou gotta do a little bit of R&amp;D.\n\n31\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.700\nDon't be afraid of writing code and\ntrying things that, well,\n\n32\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.420\nyou may end up throwing away.\n\n33\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.920\nThat's perfectly okay,\nbecause there are times when\n\n34\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.080\nwe don't really know how to solve\nthe problem we're trying to solve.\n\n35\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.530\nAnd so you were like I had a plan\nthat I want to solve this problem,\n\n36\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.820\nbut then maybe all you did too\nis probably okay, all right.\n\n37\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.760\nSo if you look here, we did some things\nwhen we at this state, when we had total\n\n38\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.000\nnumber of gases and we have running as\npart of our application state, right?\n\n39\n00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.180\nOur running app.\n\n40\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.440\nWe could have done this a bunch of ways.\n\n41\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.490\nI actually did this a different\nway in the hangman series.\n\n42\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.480\nAnd so this is to show you different\nviewpoints of thinking, right?\n\n43\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.650\nAnd then we have these global\nconfiguration variables, or\n\n44\n00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.509\nthese global constants more or less.\n\n45\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.240\nConstants as the application is running.\n\n46\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.050\nWe can always change\nthem in the source code.\n\n47\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.520\nBut as the app is running,\nthey should not be modified.\n\n48\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.010\nTechnically in Python, there's always\na way to re-assign variable names.\n\n49\n00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.120\nSo we're using naming conventions to\n\n50\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.090\ntrying to abide by a few rules that\nwe put in place for ourselves, right?\n\n51\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.970\nAnd then we have our functions,\nwe know about that,\n\n52\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.790\nthe only function we really messed\nwith a great deal was this guess.\n\n53\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.170\nWe're gonna grab a guess from the user,\nand\n\n54\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.360\nif it was a lowercase q we set the state\nof running to false, and then we returned.\n\n55\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.730\nAnd then, well, we kind of did as\nexpected, changed it to a number and\n\n56\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.390\nreturned it.\n\n57\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.090\nIf they tried to get one in over on us,\nthey type an A.\n\n58\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.060\nMaybe they did it on accident.\n\n59\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.000\nThey accidentally hit Enter.\n\n60\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.700\nWe just print out, hey, make sure you're\ntyping a valid number or Q to quit.\n\n61\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.393\nAnd then we're just asking them for\na guess, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:20.310\nWe could modify total guesses here, right?\n\n63\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.541\nHowever, I think it's better to put that\nin the main application level because it's\n\n64\n00:03:24.541 --> 00:03:28.316\na little easier to reason about if\nyou're modifying that in one place only.\n\n65\n00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:31.465\nThat's not saying there aren't times\nwhere you won't have to modify things in\n\n66\n00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:32.358\nmultiple places, but\n\n67\n00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.940\none place only makes it a little\neasier to reason about and debug.\n\n68\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.640\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n69\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.530\n&gt;&gt; So while we're running, get guesses and\nthen we're printing the state.\n\n70\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.700\nWhen we start out we have zero guesses.\n\n71\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.610\nI think this will actually make a little\nmore sense if we move this up here.\n\n72\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.930\nAnd we're still kind of reviewing.\n\n73\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.200\nSo, we're going to print\nwhat the state is.\n\n74\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.420\nAre we running and\nhow many guesses do we have?\n\n75\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.770\nAnd then give the guess,\nif the guess is none.\n\n76\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.600\nSee this construct.\n\n77\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.660\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n78\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.630\nI feel like there might\nbe a better way for that.\n\n79\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.840\nIt it's none, go back.\n\n80\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.830\nThe implication is a state not running\n\n81\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.570\nis false,\nbecause that means someone's quit.\n\n82\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.470\nAnd guess is not none,\nwe're going to continue, come to here and\n\n83\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.290\nthen the while loop terminates and\nthe game's over.\n\n84\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.180\nAnd then, if the guess is greater than\nthe number to guess, print too high.\n\n85\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.088\nIf it's less than number of guess,\nprint too low.\n\n86\n00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:29.210\nOtherwise, you win.\n\n87\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.430\nAnd at the very end, increment\nthe number of guesses, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.710\nSo that's where we are.\n\n89\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.900\nLet's take a look, and\nthen that way we can create a plan.\n\n90\n00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.340\nOr hopefully create a plan.\n\n91\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.660\nAnd then, cool.\n\n92\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.460\nSo, we had zero number of guesses.\n\n93\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.430\nWe now are guessing for the first time.\n\n94\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.804\nI'm gonna say 50.\n\n95\n00:04:46.804 --> 00:04:47.914\nToo low.\n\n96\n00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:49.680\nThat means,\nhow many times have we guessed?\n\n97\n00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.820\nWell, 50.\n\n98\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.610\nSo now this actually syncs up, it's\na little easier to reason about than in\n\n99\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.110\nthe previous episode where we\nprinted it out of order, so\n\n100\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.330\nwe were printing out the previous,\nit was weird because you would guess and\n\n101\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.370\nthen it said you'd still\nguessed zero times.\n\n102\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.710\nWell here, you've guessed zero times, then\nyou guess, then you've guessed one time.\n\n103\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.817\nThis actually makes a little more sense,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:11.425\nWhat is your guess?\n\n105\n00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:12.308\nThat's too low.\n\n106\n00:05:12.308 --> 00:05:14.524\nSo 75, too high.\n\n107\n00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:17.451\n63, too high.\n\n108\n00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:20.000\n59, too low.\n\n109\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.435\n60, yay.\n\n110\n00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.269\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n111\n00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:28.883\n&gt;&gt; So notice, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:33.342\nNow, really, we are keeping\nan accurate track of how many\n\n113\n00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:37.790\nguesses we've made at the time, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.539\nThe question is, we've got to be careful\nabout how we build logic around this.\n\n115\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.240\nIf we come here we increment this.\n\n116\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.620\nAnd then we come to the top.\n\n117\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.510\nIf I'd have guessed and\nI increment and I come to the top.\n\n118\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.065\nLet's say that's past our\nnumber of guesses, right?\n\n119\n00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:55.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n120\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.430\n&gt;&gt; So really, we should have\na little bit of logic that says hey.\n\n121\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.233\nIf you've already surpassed the number of\nguesses at this point, you've lost, right?\n\n122\n00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:06.440\nSo we have to be careful here.\n\n123\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.300\nAnd then,\nwe also need to add a little bit of\n\n124\n00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.320\npolish like here,\nwhere they have some rules.\n\n125\n00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.750\nYou should probably inform the user, hey,\n\n126\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.550\nyou only have like five times to win,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.350\nOtherwise you lose.\n\n128\n00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.570\nAll right, so\nlet's make a plan as best we can.\n\n129\n00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:36.010\nSo 4/4 breaking all illusions here,\nit's not 2016, this is #6.\n\n130\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we've gone back in time,\nall right, it's 2016 now.\n\n131\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.250\n&gt;&gt; So let's see here.\n\n132\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:49.232\nAnd we're going to determine the win and\n\n133\n00:06:49.232 --> 00:06:56.988\nlose by accomplishing the following.\n\n134\n00:06:56.988 --> 00:07:02.731\nAdd logic to quit the game at\nthe beginning of the loop.\n\n135\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.766\nIf total guesses\n\n136\n00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:18.311\nIs greater than the allowable guesses.\n\n137\n00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.548\nAll right, so I'm kind just\nthinking through this a little bit.\n\n138\n00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:30.133\nAnd then we're gonna\nclean up the quit logic.\n\n139\n00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:38.278\nAnd then clean up user prompts.\n\n140\n00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:43.707\nActually, we're gonna say add to rules\n\n141\n00:07:46.772 --> 00:07:52.287\nTo let users know they only\n\n142\n00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:58.308\nhave MAX_GUESSES, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:58.308 --> 00:07:59.510\nSo those are our three things.\n\n144\n00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.358\nWe may find out that there's few other\nthings that we can do some cleanup.\n\n145\n00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:04.940\nAnd that's perfectly fine,\nbut we have a plan in action.\n\n146\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.640\nSo let's go ahead and come down here.\n\n147\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.340\nAnd instead of printing state,\nwhat I'm thinking is, if\n\n148\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.563\nState total guesses is greater than,\n\n149\n00:08:22.563 --> 00:08:28.200\nso we're going to get an [INAUDIBLE],\nwe're going to have to think this.\n\n150\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.750\nThis is what I was talking about,\nthose edge cases.\n\n151\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.303\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Max guesses,\n\n152\n00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:40.430\nThen print You lose.\n\n153\n00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.035\nYou could really make that nice,\nbut that's nice, so great.\n\n154\n00:08:45.035 --> 00:08:45.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n155\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.380\n&gt;&gt; So there we go, so we could\nbreak there, we're perfectly fine.\n\n156\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.420\nAnd we've put it at the top of the loop,\nbut\n\n157\n00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.700\nwe may find that it's easier\nto kind of move this around.\n\n158\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.170\nOkay, so here we go lets clear,\nand I'm gonna intentionally lose,\n\n159\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.000\nseven, seven, seven, seven, seven,\nseven, seven, seven, seven, seven.\n\n160\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.830\nAll right finally, maybe we'll\nturn that max guess down from ten.\n\n161\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.530\n&gt;&gt; To five.\n&gt;&gt; For a little bit.\n\n162\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:23.630\nBut I noticed it looks like we\nmight actually got one more guess,\n\n163\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:29.790\nlet's go back and, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\n7, 8, 9, 10, 11, we've got 11 guesses.\n\n164\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.940\nThat's weird, yeah, so\nit's because of this boundary condition.\n\n165\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.120\nWe actually let you go one more time,\nand if you already hit the MAX_GUESSES.\n\n166\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.240\nSo I'm gonna put an equal to there\n,and we're going to retest and\n\n167\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.910\nsee if that works out, all right?\n\n168\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.449\nSo let's come back, And 4,\n\n169\n00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:55.000\n4, 4, all right, so I lose.\n\n170\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.751\nNow if we come back here,\nwe've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\n\n171\n00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:03.790\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, all right.\n\n172\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n173\n00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Now we actually know\nthe number of guesses.\n\n174\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.599\nAnd before I forget,\nI'm gonna turn that down, just for\n\n175\n00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:11.450\nnow during this testing phase.\n\n176\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.254\n&gt;&gt; Five.\n\n177\n00:10:12.254 --> 00:10:13.572\nI'm thinking 3.\n\n178\n00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Really, how awesome.\n\n179\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.876\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll go back and\nchange that cuz winning in 3 tryouts,\n\n180\n00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:19.589\nfrom 1 to 100 is actually very hard.\n\n181\n00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:20.846\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I bet you it is.\n\n182\n00:10:20.846 --> 00:10:22.304\n&gt;&gt; It's actually total luck.\n\n183\n00:10:22.304 --> 00:10:27.679\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking if we get to here,\n\n184\n00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:31.550\nshould this be at the top?\n\n185\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.710\nWhat if we bring this down, and\n\n186\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.030\nwe've run through all of this and\nwe haven't hit any of these.\n\n187\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.664\nAnd right after here\nwe got boop like that.\n\n188\n00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:48.965\nNotice that little boop, so we do our\nguess, we have our main guess logic,\n\n189\n00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:53.110\nall right, and\nthen we increment the total guesses.\n\n190\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.840\nIf the total guesses at this point,\n\n191\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.550\nthis would be kinda like\ncoming back to the top.\n\n192\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.690\nIf it's greater than the max\nnumber of guesses, greater than or\n\n193\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.400\nequal to the max number of guesses,\nyou lose.\n\n194\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.827\nSo it still should be the same, let's\ngo check it out, and so python3 main.\n\n195\n00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:17.150\nAnd it is, all right, so I think this\nflow makes a little more sense to me.\n\n196\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.230\nAs soon as we increment total guesses,\nlet's check to see if you've lost,\n\n197\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.160\ncuz if you have, there's no point\nin coming back up to here, right?\n\n198\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.521\nNow instead of breaking,\nwe could do something like,\n\n199\n00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:34.264\ninstead of breaking and\nalso having this state,\n\n200\n00:11:34.264 --> 00:11:39.021\nwhat I'm thinking is\nwe'll say state running,\n\n201\n00:11:41.856 --> 00:11:43.959\n= false.\n\n202\n00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:51.810\nAnd state['running'] = false, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.850\nNow, why did I do that?\n\n204\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.540\nWell instead of using break and\n\n205\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.870\nthen this other variable, I kind of\nunified that to be more consistent.\n\n206\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.580\nI'm always going to use state running,\n\n207\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.760\nto determine whether the game\nis still running or not.\n\n208\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.130\nLet's try that out, python3 main,\n\n209\n00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:17.680\nthat's good, and then 3, 3, 3 Still works.\n\n210\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.900\nThe trick is I gotta actually win, so\n\n211\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:25.660\nI'm gonna have to turn this back up\nto probably 10 to test that out.\n\n212\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.930\nAnd when you come to kind of the end of\na project, you find yourself doing these,\n\n213\n00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.110\na lot of testing and\na little bit of tweaking and fine tuning.\n\n214\n00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.242\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So let's do 50, too low.\n\n215\n00:12:36.242 --> 00:12:40.250\n75 too high, 63 too high,\n\n216\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:46.118\n59 too high, 55 too low, 57 yay I won.\n\n217\n00:12:46.118 --> 00:12:50.130\nAnd that still works and it ends, so\nnow I don't have these weird breaks.\n\n218\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.753\nI've actually said,\nokay, well, there we go,\n\n219\n00:12:54.753 --> 00:13:00.010\nit's You're running, right?\n\n220\n00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.820\nYour running has become false, and\nthen it just loops back to the top.\n\n221\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:12.530\nNow, where it gets a little\niffy is this last little bit,\n\n222\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.150\nif we come back over here,\nclean out the quit logic, what do I mean?\n\n223\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.140\nGuess is none.\n\n224\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:26.860\nYou know, that return there may be\n\n225\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.060\nreally, we're returning none, which is a\nbyproduct of setting this to false, right?\n\n226\n00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:38.407\nI'm thinking that really\nwhat we should do is\n\n227\n00:13:38.407 --> 00:13:44.930\nchange this to maybe be like,\nif should quit.\n\n228\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:50.210\nOr if state is still running, or something\n\n229\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.710\nof that nature to where it's a little\nclearer, and there's nothing perfect here.\n\n230\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.330\nIn addition to, the reason we\ndid this continue is because,\n\n231\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.480\nwell, we don't wanna check this\nbecause that breaks stuff.\n\n232\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.810\nSo one of the solutions that we could\ndo is say l if If guess is none,\n\n233\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.640\ncontinue, otherwise do these checks.\n\n234\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.870\nAnd then we still always do this,\nefectively,\n\n235\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.380\nwhat we've done is skip what's going on.\n\n236\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.730\nLikewise, this guess is none,\nI really wanna know if state is running,\n\n237\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.920\nand I'm just gonna write\na little helper method.\n\n238\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.800\nOr excuse me helper function,\nI'm letting my programmer show through.\n\n239\n00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.580\nLet's call it should quit, and really it's\njust an alias to help with readability.\n\n240\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:44.290\nI'm gonna return state running, and you'll\nsee why I'm doing that in just a moment.\n\n241\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.584\nSo if\n\n242\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:58.720\nIf we should quit,\nthen what do we want to do?\n\n243\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.940\nWell we kind of don't want to do anything,\nso we're just gonna continue, so\n\n244\n00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.450\nI'm gonna leave that.\n\n245\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.009\nBut the reason I clean this logic up is\nI'm gonna change this out a little bit,\n\n246\n00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:12.986\nand say while we not should quit,\n\n247\n00:15:20.297 --> 00:15:25.020\nI gotta quit holding that shift key,\nwhile we not should quit.\n\n248\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.030\nSo while we're not quitting run,\n\n249\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:33.580\nif we should quit return and then this\nwill kind of execute there in the loop.\n\n250\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.195\nNot the most elegant, but\n\n251\n00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:40.205\nwhat that does is it allows me\nto modify kinda this state.\n\n252\n00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:46.512\nNow, I could further change this logic and\nsay well you know if the guest,\n\n253\n00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:50.400\nthe guess is not none,\nI can add some guards.\n\n254\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.761\nBut I like this solution cuz it's\none level deeper in logic, and\n\n255\n00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:56.197\nit's probably a little\nbit easier to manage.\n\n256\n00:15:56.197 --> 00:15:58.992\nAs it stands, I think we've\ndone a little bit of clean up.\n\n257\n00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.340\nIt's not perfect.\n\n258\n00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.170\nIt's okay to use this continue.\n\n259\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.300\nMaybe we could find another way, right?\n\n260\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.284\nWe could do some reorganization here.\n\n261\n00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:14.755\nBut it would require\nan if with another if.\n\n262\n00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:18.968\nAnd let's just keep it flat and\nlevel, all right?\n\n263\n00:16:18.968 --> 00:16:20.820\nSo, here we go.\n\n264\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.810\nLet's see if it actually still works.\n\n265\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.333\nThat's important.\n\n266\n00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:27.259\nInteresting.\n\n267\n00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:33.231\nSo And.\n\n268\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.540\nNotice it immediately\nquit a runtime logic.\n\n269\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.390\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n270\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.660\nNow, it actually works.\n\n271\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.660\nSo, by doing that, I have a not and\nthen I have a not here, right?\n\n272\n00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:53.681\nYou have to be careful cuz of not not.\n\n273\n00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:58.030\nRight, double negative.\n\n274\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.570\nSo maybe, maybe see how I\nadded that helper function.\n\n275\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.880\nThis is a time where, I'm gonna add\na function, it's gonna help me.\n\n276\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.440\nBut now I have this weird indirection.\n\n277\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.787\nSo I'm actually gonna go backwards, and\n\n278\n00:17:09.787 --> 00:17:12.180\nI wanted to show you this because this\nis something that you're gonna do.\n\n279\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:18.050\nI'm gonna get rid of this, because I\ndon't think it adds to readability.\n\n280\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.870\nFunctions do not always\nadd to readability.\n\n281\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.660\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n282\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:28.260\nAnd I'm gonna say while ['running'].\n\n283\n00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.550\nAnd if not running ['running'].\n\n284\n00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:40.320\nI don't have now not nots,\nI don't have this weird indirection.\n\n285\n00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.490\nWhile state is running do this,\nif not state running continue okay?\n\n286\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.290\nTechnically I could break here, but\nI wanted to get rid of using the breaks.\n\n287\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.110\nSo I have a continue, and that's okay.\n\n288\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.290\nSo, we're good to go, but\nI wanted to show you.\n\n289\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.900\nYeah, cuz I've said in\na couple of episodes,\n\n290\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.110\nbe careful about getting\ncrazy with functions.\n\n291\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.280\nCuz sometimes they are not helpful, they\nwill actually lead to, well wait a minute,\n\n292\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.810\nhow does that work?\n\n293\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.840\nThat's a not not running.\n\n294\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.842\nSo that means it is running, or is it not?\n\n295\n00:18:05.842 --> 00:18:06.452\nWho knows.\n\n296\n00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:09.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we come back over here, and\n\n297\n00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:12.000\nwe kill it,\nlet's make sure it's still works.\n\n298\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.540\n&gt;&gt; It's like saying irregardless.\n\n299\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.\n\n300\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.680\n&gt;&gt; Irregardless, please don't say that.\n\n301\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.705\n&gt;&gt; Don't say that, no.\n\n302\n00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:22.675\n&gt;&gt; So 50, too low, 75, too high,\n63, too high, and 59, too high, 55,\n\n303\n00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:25.373\ntoo high [LAUGH] 52, too low, 53, 54.\n\n304\n00:18:25.373 --> 00:18:28.805\nI'm glad that was a ten,\notherwise, I wouldn't have won.\n\n305\n00:18:28.805 --> 00:18:32.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, what is your guess?\n\n306\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.405\nAll right, 54, you win, cool.\n\n307\n00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:41.958\nNow it does seem like we have a weird\ndistribution on the upper end.\n\n308\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.700\ni'm gonna leave that be for now, okay?\n\n309\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.626\nBut there is one thing that I've noticed.\n\n310\n00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:50.910\nThere is no, there's really nothing here\n\n311\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:56.941\nthat tells me I have\na limited number of guesses.\n\n312\n00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:59.140\nAll right, these are the rules.\n\n313\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.338\nSo as I'm thinking of a number\nI'll ask for a guess, for\n\n314\n00:19:01.338 --> 00:19:06.960\neach guess I'll let you know if it's too\nhigh, too low, or if you get it correct.\n\n315\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.290\nHowever, what happens if you've guessed\nmore then the maximum number of guesses?\n\n316\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.510\nSo I need to add that to the rule and I\nthink that'll be kind of our final polish,\n\n317\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.680\nand then I'll have some challenges for\nyou to go and extend this.\n\n318\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:27.220\nAll right, so wait for it,\nwhere'd you go, where'd you go?\n\n319\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.411\nSo here's our MAX_GUESSES,\nhere's our rules.\n\n320\n00:19:29.411 --> 00:19:30.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\nsay, There is a catch.\n\n322\n00:19:40.588 --> 00:19:46.460\nIf you guess more,\nif you guess incorrectly.\n\n323\n00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:58.290\nCurly braces, times or\nmore, then you lose.\n\n324\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:06.440\nAll right, and I'm gonna to make this\na little line continuation here.\n\n325\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.010\nAnd this should be single\nquote curly brace.\n\n326\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.580\nAnd I'm gonna make this a single quote.\n\n327\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.650\nNot a curly brace, parenthesis.\n\n328\n00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.000\nThere we go, and\n\n329\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.650\nthen I'm going to say I'll sign,\nnotice I'm between these two parenthesis.\n\n330\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:26.540\nI'm gonna say format, wait for it.\n\n331\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.800\nMAX_GUESSES.\n\n332\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.482\nSo that should replace that name.\n\n333\n00:20:31.482 --> 00:20:33.070\nLet's go check it out, see if it works.\n\n334\n00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:38.920\nAll caps.\n\n335\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.590\nBeautiful.\n\n336\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.620\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.480\nThere is a catch.\n\n338\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.193\nIf you guess incorrectly ten times or\nmore, you lose.\n\n339\n00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:48.503\nSo now we've added that little bit-\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n340\n00:20:48.503 --> 00:20:51.086\n&gt;&gt; To some extent I think our game works.\n\n341\n00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:54.799\nNot exactly sold on how this\nplays out in the long term,\n\n342\n00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:57.300\nbecause I know I was going to ask you.\n\n343\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.013\nThink about some of the things\nyou can add to this game.\n\n344\n00:21:01.013 --> 00:21:04.450\nActually Zach's already\nbrought up a great one.\n\n345\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.580\nChoose a difficulty level.\n\n346\n00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.300\nMaybe you add another menu item,\nand before the game starts,\n\n347\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.820\nthey choose a difficult,\nwhich sets the max number of guesses.\n\n348\n00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:21.400\nIn addition to this randint from 1 to 100,\nwe've seen that it has some bias.\n\n349\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.302\nRandom integers Are not necessarily,\nhow do you say random when it actually\n\n350\n00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:30.572\ncomes to computers because computers\nis doing some pseudo random\n\n351\n00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:35.385\nthings.So see if you can get it to where\nyou have a better distribution and\n\n352\n00:21:35.385 --> 00:21:38.644\nmaybe if you played long enough,\nyou do get that.\n\n353\n00:21:38.644 --> 00:21:44.720\nThen finally, it's not so much this game,\nthis is guess the number, right.\n\n354\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.190\nYou could make a simpler version\ninstead of having 1 to 100.\n\n355\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.656\nYou could have just guess a letter,\nright, same logic, but\n\n356\n00:21:52.656 --> 00:21:57.315\ninstead of using numbers you\nhave to have respective letters.\n\n357\n00:21:57.315 --> 00:22:01.610\nIt's the same general idea, but\nit does require a little bit of tweaking,\n\n358\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.980\nbecause I need to grab a random letter,\nright?\n\n359\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:10.080\nAnd when I grab a random letter,\nI now have to,\n\n360\n00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.730\nwas it this letter or is it this letter?\n\n361\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.360\nSo this is essentially the same project,\nbut different.\n\n362\n00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.510\nSo those are three things.\n\n363\n00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.367\nOr dream up you own set of features that\nyou wanna add to this and go out and\n\n364\n00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:23.018\nmake them.\n\n365\n00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:25.527\nI would be interested to\nsee kind of what ideas\n\n366\n00:22:25.527 --> 00:22:28.710\ncome to mind when you're\nbuilding something like this.\n\n367\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:33.020\nBut Zach, as far as it is, we kind of\nhit a done state, where we're nice and\n\n368\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.190\npolished, and\nI'm gonna wipe my hands and leave it be.\n\n369\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.800\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, well played,\nwell played, pun intended.\n\n370\n00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.100\n[LAUGH] Determine win or lose, anything\nelse you'd like to say Justin, before we-\n\n371\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.050\n&gt;&gt; Well definitely just\n\n372\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.770\ngo build something.\n\n373\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.280\nAlways be building something if\nyou want to perfect your craft.\n\n374\n00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.693\nAnd realize that, and I try to emulate\nthis when we build these things.\n\n375\n00:22:51.693 --> 00:22:53.248\nNot everything has to be perfect.\n\n376\n00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:55.450\nNot everything has to be just so.\n\n377\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.760\nYou will find sometimes that\nyou've went down the wrong path.\n\n378\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.770\nDon't be afraid to back up.\n\n379\n00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.810\nRemember, frustration a little\nbit is the name of the game.\n\n380\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.626\nLook at the.\n\n381\n00:23:04.626 --> 00:23:09.000\nSet small, short-term goals, get to those,\nand that way you can have a longer\n\n382\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.320\nterm goal that is achievable, and\nyou don't quit because of frustration.\n\n383\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.241\nSo, let's go build things,\nget better at what you do.\n\n384\n00:23:15.241 --> 00:23:18.695\nAnd, well, as long as you're better than\nyou were yesterday, we're all good to go.\n\n385\n00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:22.228\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, applied fundamentals,\nguess the number, it's a wonderful series\n\n386\n00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:25.785\ncreated by Justin, and he's done perfect\njob putting it all together for you.\n\n387\n00:23:25.785 --> 00:23:28.925\nMake sure you watch all the episodes and\nyou'll be in the course library anyway,\n\n388\n00:23:28.925 --> 00:23:32.495\nand there's thousands of other videos\nthere all designed to help you go further,\n\n389\n00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:33.275\ncheck those out too.\n\n390\n00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:35.530\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevProTV,\n\n391\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.261\na good DevPro is always learning.\n\n392\n00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:40.180\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n393\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:46.517\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you again soon.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
