I'm doing fantastic, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:30.305\nHow are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:31.185\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty good.\n\n11\n00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:32.563\nI'm looking forward to this new show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:36.075\nIt sounds like we're gonna\nbe planning out a project.\n\n13\n00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:38.821\n&gt;&gt; We are, and that's a very\nimportant part of problem solving.\n\n14\n00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.710\nAnd well, building anything\nis actually problem solving.\n\n15\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.020\nSo let's think about it..\n\n16\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.740\nWhat are we gonna build?\n\n17\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.940\nWe're gonna build Hangman.\n\n18\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.010\nNow, I was kinda on the fence about saying\nthat, but it was a childhood game that I\n\n19\n00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.295\nplayed, that we all played, but it does\nhave kind of a morbid nature to it.\n\n20\n00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:55.583\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna go with it because\n\n21\n00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:56.270\nit's familiar.\n\n22\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.415\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny,\nwhen you said something to me too,\n\n23\n00:00:58.415 --> 00:00:59.840\nlike, what do you think about that?\n\n24\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.540\nI'm like, I played that all the time.\n\n25\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.763\nI think i'ts just like a regular\nchildhood game, but then like, yeah,\n\n26\n00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:06.952\nthat is pretty bad.\n\n27\n00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n28\n00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.786\nit's a spelling bee that\nends in a gallow's walk.\n\n29\n00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:12.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n30\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.410\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n31\n00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.255\nAnd well,\nit's very important to plan your project.\n\n32\n00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.800\nThen, we're going to follow\na set of steps, right?\n\n33\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.810\nFirst off,\n\n34\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.980\nwe're gonna make sure that we're all\non the same page with certain dynamics.\n\n35\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.677\nMaybe you've played it with house rules\nwhere things are a little bit different.\n\n36\n00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:34.008\nAnd I am gonna make some modifications\njust to keep things simple, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.350\nThen, we're gonna follow, what do I know?\n\n38\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.345\nWhat do I need to know?\nI'm gonna draw a picture of what I want to\n\n39\n00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:45.287\nbuild and kinda label it out, and\nthen I'm gonna make the consideration,\n\n40\n00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:50.300\nhave I made things too complicated and\nshould I simplify the problem?\n\n41\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.500\nSo when you go to solve a problem,\nthose are really\n\n42\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500\nkey steps that you should always\nengage in during your planning phase.\n\n43\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.050\nAnd if you don't, well,\nthings can get a little awry.\n\n44\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.280\n&gt;&gt; I feel that last one is\nsomething that I'm kind of bad at.\n\n45\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.550\nPeople ask me like,\nhey how do you do this in program x?\n\n46\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.140\nAnd I'm like, you do this, this,\nthis, this, this, this, this, this.\n\n47\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.689\nAnd then it's like someone else\ncomes along and says, well,\n\n48\n00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.320\nwhat if you just went from here to here?\n\n49\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.027\nAnd I'm like, yeah that would have\nbeen easier if I would have just maybe\n\n50\n00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:21.237\nthought about it for\na little bit, planned it out,\n\n51\n00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:26.290\nand realized there was a much simpler\nanswer to my question or my problem.\n\n52\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.500\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right, Vonne.\n\n53\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.850\nSometimes I tend to\nover-complicate things as well.\n\n54\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.340\nBut in addition to that,\nsomething about problem solving, and\n\n55\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.996\nI learned this through my background, if\nthe problem you're approaching is getting\n\n56\n00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:41.920\nyou frustrated, a little too difficult,\nthen you know what you do?\n\n57\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.560\nYou change the problem.\n\n58\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.820\nYou make sacrifices and you pare down\nyour scope, essentially, and say, well,\n\n59\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.120\nI could build all these things or I could\nsolve all these problems which are part of\n\n60\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.850\nthe grander problem, but really, all I\ncare about is maybe this first subset.\n\n61\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.820\nI want to have these small successes,\nand if I have those,\n\n62\n00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.472\nthen I don't get frustrated and I continue\nto move forward and I continue learning.\n\n63\n00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:09.690\nYou'd build a whole lot of like just\nall kinds of big stuff, then you're\n\n64\n00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.570\nprobably just going to be gnashing your\nteeth and kinda clenching your fists.\n\n65\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nsmall victories are always nice, yes.\n\n66\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.752\nA group of my friends and I,\nwe have a #sv18, small victory 18.\n\n67\n00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:24.374\nIt's like, I only ate two pieces\nof pizza instead of three.\n\n68\n00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:25.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; sv18.\n\n69\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.124\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n70\n00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:26.628\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:28.392\nAnd I eat a lot more than that, but\n\n72\n00:03:28.392 --> 00:03:30.403\nthat's all right.\nThat's all right.\n\n73\n00:03:30.403 --> 00:03:31.670\nBut I think the first thing to do\n\n74\n00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.560\nis always make sure we're all on the same\npage with what we're building, right?\n\n75\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.500\nWhat is the problem we're\ntrying to accomplish?\n\n76\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.360\nAnd well, we're gonna be building\nsomething with software, so\n\n77\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.850\nwe need to know the dynamics of\nwhat you would normally make.\n\n78\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.960\nAnd games are a great way because we enjoy\nplaying them and they're very simple.\n\n79\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.880\nWhat you'd find out is even simple\ngames can sometimes lead to\n\n80\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.760\ncomplex solutions when you're\nbuilding them on a computer.\n\n81\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.030\nSo, let's start by playing a game.\n\n82\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.394\nYou ready to play a game, Vonne?\n\n83\n00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:01.040\n&gt;&gt; I love games.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna play a game.\n\n84\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.790\n&gt;&gt; Let's go.\n\n85\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.460\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen.\n\n86\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.710\nAnd well, I have the ability to draw.\n\n87\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.330\nIt makes me so happy.\n\n88\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.410\nSo let's play Hangman.\n\n89\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.042\nBut instead of actually drawing\nthe gallows and stuff like that, I'm just\n\n90\n00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:19.310\ngonna say, you get five guesses and I'm\njust gonna keep track of the five guesses.\n\n91\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.000\nSo that's an immediate alteration\nto the game, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.190\nAnd I've done that because I know that\n\n93\n00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.870\ndrawing the little person is\nprobably a little more complicated.\n\n94\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.194\nSo I've already simplified\nthe problem upfront a little bit, and\n\n95\n00:04:34.194 --> 00:04:35.328\nthat's okay with me.\n\n96\n00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:38.040\nIf it's not with you,\nthen we can worry about that later.\n\n97\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.450\n&gt;&gt; I just realized you're\nplanning out the game.\n\n98\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.770\nI'm like, okay, I'm ready.\n\n99\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.670\nWhat are the letters?\n\n100\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.320\nHow many?\n\n101\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.132\nI'm like, no, you're already\nplanning what we're building,\n\n102\n00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:47.640\nnot just playing the game right now.\n\n103\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.013\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna play the game now.\n\n104\n00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:50.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yep.\n\n105\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.140\nSo let's see here.\n\n106\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.300\nWe got, wait a minute.\n\n107\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.590\nAll right, cool.\n\n108\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.680\nThere's the letters, Vonne.\n\n109\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.190\nWhat's our first letter\nthat you're gonna guess?\n\n110\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.030\n&gt;&gt; S.\n\n111\n00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's an s there, right there.\n\n112\n00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:07.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n113\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.420\n&gt;&gt; What's the next letter?\n&gt;&gt; T.\n\n114\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.300\n&gt;&gt; And there's strike 1.\n\n115\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.017\n&gt;&gt; E?\n&gt;&gt; All right, here's an e,\n\n116\n00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:19.020\nhere's an e, here's an e.\n\n117\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.590\n&gt;&gt; What's your next letter, Vonne?\n\n118\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.280\n&gt;&gt; I know what this is.\n\n119\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.140\n&gt;&gt; What is it?\n\n120\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Cheese.\n\n121\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.424\n&gt;&gt; It is cheese.\n\n122\n00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:28.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n123\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.270\nmaybe we have something like,\nYou Win, right?\n\n124\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.920\nSo, like that.\n\n125\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.380\nNow, to further clarify the dynamics,\nthank you so\n\n126\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.970\nmuch, Vonne, we could play this all day.\n\n127\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.730\nIt is kinda fun cuz I like\nmaking up a bunch of words and\n\n128\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.870\nsee if you can get them.\n\n129\n00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.062\nBut it is something just to know,\nwhat are we building?\n\n130\n00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:52.500\nIt's fairly simple, but now, how do we\ngo about all these individual pieces?\n\n131\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.835\n&gt;&gt; And I like cheese.\n\n132\n00:05:53.835 --> 00:05:54.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.740\n&gt;&gt; I do enjoy cheese as well.\n\n134\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.660\nSo I'm gonna scroll\ndown here a little bit.\n\n135\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.430\nAnd let's think about this.\n\n136\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.110\nSo what do I know?\n\n137\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:12.026\nI know that I want to determine wins,\nright?\n\n138\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.841\nRight, so you either win or you lose.\n\n139\n00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:22.600\nLet's further clarify that\nwith this little subsection.\n\n140\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.130\nIf you have more than 5 guesses, right?\n\n141\n00:06:29.462 --> 00:06:30.670\nThen you lose.\n\n142\n00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:37.813\nOtherwise, if you have all the letters,\nand\n\n143\n00:06:37.813 --> 00:06:44.658\nI'm gonna say all letters just to simplify\nwhat we're writing here, you win!\n\n144\n00:06:47.644 --> 00:06:49.050\nAll right?\n\n145\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.250\nSo there's our win.\n\n146\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.450\nSo I want to determine wins.\n\n147\n00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:56.460\nWhat else?\n\n148\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.520\nI want to just randomly select.\n\n149\n00:07:02.597 --> 00:07:04.360\nWell, I can't write Vonne.\n\n150\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Select words, all right?\n\n151\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.130\nWell let's-\n&gt;&gt; To ll's?\n\n152\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.910\n[LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing to see here.\n\n154\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.980\nSelect words, all right?\n\n155\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.580\nSo, this is from a list of words.\n\n156\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.470\nSo I have like a word bank, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.510\nAnd I'll just randomly select one.\n\n158\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.300\n&gt;&gt; So maybe you have a list of 50 words\nand you want to just pick one and\n\n159\n00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.440\nthat becomes the word that\nthe person is going to try to guess.\n\n160\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.960\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n161\n00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.450\nAnd then, what else do I want?\n\n162\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.460\nI want to draw blanks Right?\n\n163\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.460\nTo draw blanks.\n\n164\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.480\n&gt;&gt; Draw blanks?\n\n165\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like the blanks right\nup here before I filled in cheese.\n\n166\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.870\nSo I want to draw the blanks-\n&gt;&gt; All the little lines for\n\n167\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.360\nwhat were holding the letter values\nof what we're going to guess?\n\n168\n00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.629\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSo blanks are placeholders.\n\n169\n00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:58.913\nAnd then, I want to reveal when\n\n170\n00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:03.593\ncorrect guesses are made.\n\n171\n00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:04.307\nOf each letter.\n\n172\n00:08:04.307 --> 00:08:05.782\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So like what you said,\n\n173\n00:08:05.782 --> 00:08:07.661\nlike guess a letter, and I said, E.\n\n174\n00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:12.880\nAnd so that was like, yes, there is\nan E at this particular placeholder?\n\n175\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n176\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n177\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.890\nwe're gonna reveal when\nwe make correct guesses.\n\n178\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.298\n&gt;&gt; It's funny when you like,\nkinda slow it down like this.\n\n179\n00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:23.942\nOkay, that's what that particular\npart of what we just did, and\n\n180\n00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:25.610\njust kind of identifying it.\n\n181\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.740\nReally going through like every\nsingle step that we're gonna take.\n\n182\n00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n183\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.800\nSo this is part of our I know, right?\n\n184\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.870\nWhat else can we determine?\n\n185\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.990\nMm, well, I know how many blanks, right?\n\n186\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.570\nSo something else I know,\nhow many blanks I need for each word.\n\n187\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.070\nAnd we could keep going.\n\n188\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.998\nWhoa, look at that, that was, how many\nblanks I need for each word, right?\n\n189\n00:08:57.998 --> 00:09:01.898\nAnd really, that's kind of what we know,\nif go back up here and we think, and\n\n190\n00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:03.900\nthis is not always perfect.\n\n191\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.660\nSo I pick a word, right?\n\n192\n00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.410\nI picked a word when Vonne said, let's\nplay, and then I drew out the blanks.\n\n193\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.327\nAnd then more than five guesses.\n\n194\n00:09:14.327 --> 00:09:16.567\nSomething else.\n\n195\n00:09:18.943 --> 00:09:20.298\nKeep a mark.\n\n196\n00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:23.800\nFor wrong guess.\n\n197\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.114\n&gt;&gt; That was where like, I guessed, I can't\nremember what letter, it was a T, right?\n\n198\n00:09:30.114 --> 00:09:30.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a T.\n\n199\n00:09:30.734 --> 00:09:33.633\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and you said nope,\ncuz that was the whole like,\n\n200\n00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:37.048\nif you're making a wrong guess,\nyou get the head and the body,\n\n201\n00:09:37.048 --> 00:09:40.560\nand all that kind of stuff when\nyou're drawing out the hangman.\n\n202\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSo, I'm looking at this and\n\n203\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.560\nthe way that I've played this is,\nyou draw, you pick a word.\n\n204\n00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.735\nI picked a word in my mind, but\n\n205\n00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:49.851\nwe're gonna have to tell\nthe computer how to do that.\n\n206\n00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:53.670\nAnd when you've made a wrong guess,\nI keep trying.\n\n207\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.498\nIf you were to get to five,\nI'm gonna say, you lose.\n\n208\n00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:59.272\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; If you guess all the letters,\n\n209\n00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:00.940\nthen you win, right?\n\n210\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.990\nAnd then, I think that's fairly simple.\n\n211\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.805\nNow, you may find that this morphs\nthroughout but that's all right.\n\n212\n00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:09.870\nBut that's kind of like what I know.\n\n213\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:17.210\nLike what I need, what I know, what are\nsome things that I need to know, right?\n\n214\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.970\nSo let's actually change this,\nsome things I need to figure out.\n\n215\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.380\nAnd that's how to draw blanks, right?\n\n216\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.750\nHow do I draw these blanks?\n\n217\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.510\nSo I know I need to do those but\nhow do I do that?\n\n218\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.223\nHow do I draw blanks?\n\n219\n00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:45.300\nHow do I get random words?\n\n220\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Could we move that up a little bit?\n\n221\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n\n222\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.030\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n223\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.830\nThank you.\n&gt;&gt; Random words.\n\n224\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.560\nSo I'm just gonna put\na question mark there, right?\n\n225\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.510\nAnd then how am I going to\nreport this to the user?\n\n226\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.810\nLike how am I gonna show this?\n\n227\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.410\nBecause if I go back up here and\nI think back through this.\n\n228\n00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.500\nThis was a static image, but\nif a computer needs to update,\n\n229\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.820\nI don't know if we're gonna be creating\nlike, PNGs or JPGs, or anything.\n\n230\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.950\nHow am I going to do that?\n\n231\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.780\nSo how do I update what the user sees?\n\n232\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:23.770\nSo how to update the UI.\n\n233\n00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.270\nAnd what do I mean by UI?\n\n234\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.030\nThat's some jargon, right?\n\n235\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.674\nUser interface, how am I,\nthe thing that you're interacting with,\n\n236\n00:11:30.674 --> 00:11:33.473\nand this isn't gonna be like,\nblow your mind crazy.\n\n237\n00:11:33.473 --> 00:11:37.560\nBut it does need to update and\nI can do some tricks here.\n\n238\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.170\nSo how do I update this user interface?\n\n239\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.912\nNow there may be a few other things,\nbut sometimes what you need to find out\n\n240\n00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:53.203\nisn't as clear until you start planning\nout, okay, how do I need to build this?\n\n241\n00:11:53.203 --> 00:11:57.304\nLike, what do I want as far as the UI and\nuser interactions?\n\n242\n00:11:57.304 --> 00:12:02.137\nSo let's do a little\nbit of draw a picture.\n\n243\n00:12:02.137 --> 00:12:06.780\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna build this on the terminal and\n\n244\n00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.740\nwhat I'm thinking is you have\nyour terminal here, right?\n\n245\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.665\nThat was sleek.\n\n246\n00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:14.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.310\n&gt;&gt; Out of completes there.\n\n248\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.960\nAnd let's say behind the scenes you start,\nright?\n\n249\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.250\nSo the user starts.\n\n250\n00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:30.655\nAnd then when the game starts,\nthis clears out, so I'm gonna clear.\n\n251\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.843\nAnd behind the scenes,\nwe're gonna pick a word, and\n\n252\n00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:37.846\nthen that word is just gonna go,\nwhoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.\n\n253\n00:12:37.846 --> 00:12:40.920\nLike that, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.678\nAnd then from there, I think, whoop,\n\n255\n00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:48.570\neasy there from there.\n\n256\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:55.510\nI'm thinking, what's the interactions,\nthe user types to guess.\n\n257\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.350\nSo types a letter.\n\n258\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.610\nAnd let's say that the user\nguesses correctly.\n\n259\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.630\nThen, whoop, and they guessed O.\n\n260\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.070\nSo they typed the letter O.\n\n261\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.550\n&gt;&gt; Can I maybe ask a question?\n\n262\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.510\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.\n\n263\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:14.090\n&gt;&gt; Where would they be typing,\nI guess it's just an input, right?\n\n264\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:19.042\nIf they click the letter E,\nI guess, O on a keyboard.\n\n265\n00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:23.880\nIt's gonna recognize that input,\ncuz it's basically kind of like, hey,\n\n266\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.522\nguess, so it's waiting for\nthe keyboard to input the O.\n\n267\n00:13:27.522 --> 00:13:31.713\nSo we don't have to like, put it down,\nyou know what I'm trying to say?\n\n268\n00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:33.427\n&gt;&gt; No, it is not a point-and-click.\n\n269\n00:13:33.427 --> 00:13:35.745\nWe're gonna to stay with\nother input types, but\n\n270\n00:13:35.745 --> 00:13:37.990\nthose are valid considerations to make.\n\n271\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.809\nAnd there's kind of assumptions going on,\ndraw a picture, so\n\n272\n00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:42.080\nwhat are the assumptions?\n\n273\n00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.370\nThey have access to a keyboard, right?\n\n274\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.590\nAnd they've started something, right?\n\n275\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.180\n&gt;&gt; I guess I was thinking it was like a\nform field or like a box they type in, but\n\n276\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.070\nno, I don't, that was like me over\ncomplicating it already of just no.\n\n277\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.765\nIt's waiting for them to type in\na letter and then you're gonna,\n\n278\n00:13:57.765 --> 00:13:59.043\nmaybe I'm going to far ahead.\n\n279\n00:13:59.043 --> 00:14:01.862\nBut now we have to verify\nif that letter exists,\n\n280\n00:14:01.862 --> 00:14:06.250\nand then where it goes within those\nblanks, those spaces that we create.\n\n281\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:11.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what they're gonna type on\nthe keyboard, the letter either pops up.\n\n282\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.010\nSo they type O, which is correct, right?\n\n283\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.790\nSo there's a correct one.\n\n284\n00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.000\nAnd it displays that.\n\n285\n00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.490\nAnd then they type the letter S, so\n\n286\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:28.980\nit types S, which is incorrect.\n\n287\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.650\nSo I'm just gonna put bad,\nall right, just to keep it simple.\n\n288\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.040\nAnd so now,\nthis is where drawing the picture,\n\n289\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.580\nI just realized when I started up here,\nI didn't consider something else.\n\n290\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.730\nHow many guesses do you have left?\n\n291\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.870\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that.\n\n292\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.460\nShould we put something in a place\nthat says guesses equals zero, and\n\n293\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.000\nthen every time that they guess\nthen it's like an iteration, right?\n\n294\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.179\nOkay, now there's like a one and a two,\nand that has to kinda keep constant,\n\n295\n00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:03.460\nwhether you guessed correctly or\nincorrectly.\n\n296\n00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.320\n&gt;&gt; So yes, yes, exactly.\n\n297\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.938\n&gt;&gt; Or do we get five,\nI guess, there's, sorry,\n\n298\n00:15:10.938 --> 00:15:13.104\nthey're all on a little loop in there.\n\n299\n00:15:13.104 --> 00:15:13.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n300\n00:15:13.707 --> 00:15:16.234\nyou're bringing to light some of the\nthings that are very difficult when you\n\n301\n00:15:16.234 --> 00:15:17.230\nfirst start these projects.\n\n302\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.040\nAnd I like drawing the picture,\nbecause we get down here and\n\n303\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.840\nwe go, well, you typed S,\nwhich was incorrect.\n\n304\n00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.800\nWell, what should I do?\n\n305\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.040\nWell that's a gap.\n\n306\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.360\nWait a minute, I forgot the guess part.\n\n307\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.842\nSo now because you've drawn a picture,\n\n308\n00:15:32.842 --> 00:15:35.624\nI was getting ready to\nsay written a picture.\n\n309\n00:15:35.624 --> 00:15:37.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Drawn a picture,\n\n310\n00:15:37.673 --> 00:15:41.090\nyou can move back through and replan.\n\n311\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.150\nIt's not gonna be perfect, right?\n\n312\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.774\nSo if I'm like well, down here,\nI want like a guesses.\n\n313\n00:15:46.774 --> 00:15:49.636\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like how it's like, guesses.\n\n314\n00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:54.454\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a visual,\nyou're visualizing what you want to see,\n\n315\n00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:58.941\nbut you said, whoops,\nI don't see this so I need to put that.\n\n316\n00:15:58.941 --> 00:15:59.732\nAnd.\n\n317\n00:15:59.732 --> 00:16:00.837\nOne more question.\n\n318\n00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:03.887\n[LAUGH] Are we saying\nif you guess correct,\n\n319\n00:16:03.887 --> 00:16:08.260\nthat doesn't count towards\nyour total number of guesses?\n\n320\n00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.270\nOr is it you only get five incorrect,\nor five total?\n\n321\n00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.640\n&gt;&gt; So that came to light,\ncuz we made some assumptions up here.\n\n322\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.610\nIf we scroll back up.\n\n323\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.890\nMore than five guesses you lose.\n\n324\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:27.340\nWell, that means that you're limited to\nthe number of words, but being specific.\n\n325\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Number of letters.\n\n326\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Number of letters, excuse me.\n\n327\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.230\nThe number of characters\nin a particular word.\n\n328\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.820\nBut being specific is important.\n\n329\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.220\nAnd you get more than five.\n\n330\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.168\nAnd let's come in here and put, incorrect.\n\n331\n00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:42.080\n&gt;&gt; Bad [LAUGH].\n\n332\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.220\n&gt;&gt; Incorrect guesses.\n\n333\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.960\nSo more than five incorrect guesses,\nso that's what we need to count.\n\n334\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.680\nAll right, but\nwe further refined our plan.\n\n335\n00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.950\nSo if we come back down here,\nwe have guesses.\n\n336\n00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.880\nAnd then here, to follow that same thing,\nwe guess correctly.\n\n337\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.500\nSo Guesses.\n\n338\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.140\n&gt;&gt; Would still equal zero.\n\n339\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n340\n00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.620\n&gt;&gt; And I mean, I know I'm not\na programmer or anything like that.\n\n341\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.652\nBut I'm thinking it's an if this happens,\nthen, I'm thinking almost like Excel or\n\n342\n00:17:11.652 --> 00:17:12.495\nother programs.\n\n343\n00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:14.572\nBut I know there's,\nif statements, and loops, and\n\n344\n00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:15.922\nall that kind of checking things.\n\n345\n00:17:15.922 --> 00:17:17.759\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna bring all of this together.\n\n346\n00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:20.227\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right, so\n\n347\n00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:21.364\nthey type that.\n\n348\n00:17:21.364 --> 00:17:26.086\nAnd this O is still here, but\nat this point, they did something bad, so\n\n349\n00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:27.130\nnow this part.\n\n350\n00:17:28.933 --> 00:17:30.150\nThat's not how you spell guesses.\n\n351\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Updates to one, just like that.\n\n352\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:39.160\nNow, we could continue drawing out these,\nbut for the sake of brevity and so\n\n353\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.380\nyou're not just watching me draw.\n\n354\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.140\nLet's say there's some\ntime that has passed, and\n\n355\n00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.280\nI'm gonna say Some time has passed.\n\n356\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.460\nAnd now we're at a frame\nthat looks like this.\n\n357\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.390\nSome number of Guesses.\n\n358\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.594\nI cannot spell Guesses.\n\n359\n00:17:57.594 --> 00:18:00.087\nLet me scroll that up for\nyou just a little bit.\n\n360\n00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:04.351\nI have two incorrect guesses but\nthey have a w, they have an o,\n\n361\n00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:06.650\nthere's an empty letter and a d.\n\n362\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.570\nAnd just to make this\na little more nerve wrecking,\n\n363\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.890\nlet's say they're at five,\nthey're at their upper limit.\n\n364\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.500\nMore than five.\n\n365\n00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.330\n&gt;&gt;

Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Not greater than or equal too.\n\n369\n00:18:29.323 --> 00:18:33.264\n&gt;&gt; Now that was part of my assumptions,\nmore than.\n\n370\n00:18:33.264 --> 00:18:37.720\nBut I couldn't come back and change that,\nbut let's just keep it standard.\n\n371\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.160\nSo I'm here, and now, there's a decision\npoint, there's an end, right?\n\n372\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:50.460\nSo I'm either correct, and let's just say,\nI'm either correct or I'm wrong.\n\n373\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.350\nWhen I do that, then what do I want?\n\n374\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.920\nI'm thinking something like this,\nthere's actually a little more real state,\n\n375\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.920\nI'm drawing this smaller.\n\n376\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.954\nLike I'm here, then I have w, o, r,\n\n377\n00:19:05.954 --> 00:19:11.552\nd and Guesses, something in there.\n\n378\n00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:16.678\nAnd them I'm thinking maybe, a WIN.\n\n379\n00:19:16.678 --> 00:19:18.640\nJust, yay, something like that.\n\n380\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.560\nOr you can have something like,\n\n381\n00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.340\nI made that very small,\nlet's actually try that one more time.\n\n382\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.560\nSo you come here and\nyou have w, o, r, uh-oh.\n\n383\n00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.350\nYou didn't guess the r correctly, right?\n\n384\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:47.350\nBlank, blank, blank, there's d, blank,\nand then you have some Guesses here.\n\n385\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.570\nAnd notice I'm not taking a lot of time\nto necessarily make these perfect.\n\n386\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.960\nI'm not opening Illustrator or anything.\n\n387\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.630\nI'm just trying to plan, what am I doing?\n\n388\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.742\nWhat are the interactions\nthat are occurring?\n\n389\n00:19:55.742 --> 00:20:00.073\nAnd then you go, Loser, like that.\n\n390\n00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:03.540\nOr maybe you're like, well try again.\n\n391\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.990\nDepending on your messaging.\n\n392\n00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.930\nSo these are kind of the endpoints here,\nand\n\n393\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.700\nat this I think that maybe\nthe game should just end.\n\n394\n00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.450\n&gt;&gt; So we just don't give them the answer.\n\n395\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.590\nIf you didn't guess it,\nwe're not gonna tell you the correct word.\n\n396\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.650\nWe're not gonna fill it in,\njust leave it open-ended.\n\n397\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and just see what happens\non your next iteration, so.\n\n398\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.980\n&gt;&gt; But we could always,\n\n399\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.430\nif we were thinking,\ndo I want them to see the correct answer.\n\n400\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.430\nThat could be part of our storyboard,\nif you wanna say.\n\n401\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.270\nWe're just choosing it, and that's\nsomething you just make your choice.\n\n402\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.060\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\nthis is very similar to a storyboard,\n\n403\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.220\nor I guess it technically\nis an exact storyboard.\n\n404\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.280\nBut it's an important\nproblem solving tool.\n\n405\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.360\nDraw a picture, what am I expecting?\n\n406\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.110\nWhat should I do?\n\n407\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.690\nBecause we actually highlighted\nsome ambiguities in our original\n\n408\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.720\nwhat do I know, and what do I need\nto know in order to accomplish that.\n\n409\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:06.620\nAnd this does change a little bit for\nother problems versus programming.\n\n410\n00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:12.300\nBut now I come down here and I have to\nask myself, do I need a simpler problem?\n\n411\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.390\nDo I reduce the complexity to get started?\n\n412\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.690\nIf I come back and I look,\nwell, what do I need to know?\n\n413\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.260\nI need to know the word.\n\n414\n00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.670\nI need to know guesses at the start.\n\n415\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:37.412\nI need to know how many blanks\nI'm gonna have on there.\n\n416\n00:21:37.412 --> 00:21:43.332\nAnd then as you interact, I need to\ndetermine correctness and make decisions.\n\n417\n00:21:44.757 --> 00:21:48.486\nIt doesn't seem too complicated but\nmy recommendation is,\n\n418\n00:21:48.486 --> 00:21:53.050\nif you try to build all of this at once,\nyou may go, well hold on a second.\n\n419\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.570\nAm I handling just guesses, or\nam I handling drawing the word?\n\n420\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.770\nThe ultimate goal is to\nget this finished product.\n\n421\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.580\nBut what is the simpler version?\n\n422\n00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.300\nWhat is the simpler problem?\n\n423\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.030\nWhat if in order to get here,\ninstead of worrying about guesses,\n\n424\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.680\nI just leave those out?\n\n425\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.150\nJust get rid of them.\n\n426\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.500\nDon't just put them out of your mind, and\n\n427\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.830\nfocus on drawing blanks and\ntaking guesses.\n\n428\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.110\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen seeing if they are correct, yeah.\n\n429\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So infinite number of guesses,\n\n430\n00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.380\nyou can sit there and\n\n431\n00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.018\ngo through every single letter of\nthe alphabet if you really wanted to.\n\n432\n00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:36.420\nCuz, well, if you go through all\nof them you're gonna get it right.\n\n433\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.040\n&gt;&gt; So we'll just take this out.\n\n434\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.200\nAnd you know what, because we're\nnot gonna determine win or lose,\n\n435\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.950\nbecause we've removed guesses.\n\n436\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.440\nSo we're gonna take this out, and\n\n437\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.690\neffectively all you have to\nworry about now is the word.\n\n438\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.017\nAnd not the number of guesses,\nbut just determining the letter,\n\n439\n00:22:55.017 --> 00:22:56.754\nwhether it's there or not.\n\n440\n00:22:56.754 --> 00:22:59.204\nAnd that's enough, and\ndrawing these respective blanks.\n\n441\n00:22:59.204 --> 00:23:01.403\n&gt;&gt; So yeah the blanks, the word and\n\n442\n00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:06.670\nputting the letters in their proper space,\nwhen people make their guess.\n\n443\n00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.150\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly.\n\n444\n00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.170\nAnd by approaching this simpler problem,\n\n445\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.990\nif we get this down,\nthen we can come back and go, cool.\n\n446\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.380\nNow that I know how that works,\nlet me add every time you guess a letter,\n\n447\n00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.500\nif it is in there, do nothing else,\nif it's not, add two guesses.\n\n448\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.220\nAnd now you take these simpler problems,\nand you compose them together, and\n\n449\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.540\nyou end up with a finished product.\n\n450\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.690\nNow again, it's not gonna be blow\nyour mind awesome at the very end.\n\n451\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:40.620\nBut it's about the mythology,\nnot mythology, methodology.\n\n452\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.260\nWow, mythology's something different.\n\n453\n00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.390\nBut, hopefully that reveals what our\nplan is, and over the next few episodes,\n\n454\n00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.230\nwe're going to implement this plan.\n\n455\n00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.650\nIf you make a plan you\nneed to implement it, and\n\n456\n00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.030\nbuild our very first version of Hangman.\n\n457\n00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.870\nAnd then I'm gonna show you,\nafter your initial concept comes to life,\n\n458\n00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.500\nmaybe you'll start adding a little more,\na little more, a little more.\n\n459\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.810\nAnd this is how you should\napproach problems, or\n\n460\n00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.530\nwhen you want to build something using\nyour newly found programming skills.\n\n461\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was a lot of fun.\n\n462\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.170\nI mean cuz we played a game right?\n\n463\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.150\nI guessed cheese.\n\n464\n00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:20.590\nI'm happy that I won and everything, but I\nmean planning a project, problem solving.\n\n465\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.340\nIt is a little bit of a game.\n\n466\n00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.160\nYou have to kind of just play it and not\nget too frustrated when you play it, so\n\n467\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.910\nthat way you'll win.\n\n468\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.970\nYay, well I'm looking forward to some\nmore episodes in this little series.\n\n469\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:33.960\nAnd I hope you are too.\n\n470\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.060\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n471\n00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.630\nSigning off for DEVPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n472\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n473\n00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.143\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n474\n00:24:41.143 --> 00:24:50.999\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

All right,\n\n13\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.110\nwell I'm trying to take a very\nmethodical approach, so\n\n14\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.400\nhopefully I can deliver on\nthe promises that you have made.\n\n15\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.700\nI make no guarantees, so we'll just\nhave to wait and see what happens.\n\n16\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.840\nSo trying to keep this kind of chunked\nto how I would approach, these episodes\n\n17\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.620\nshould follow, more or less how would\nI approach building something, right?\n\n18\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.050\nWe're gonna be building a game, but maybe\nit's something more complex than that.\n\n19\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.300\nAfter I do the initial plan, I'm then\ngonna set up my project structure.\n\n20\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.090\nThat may change over time,\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n21\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.290\nI'm gonna set up my\ninitial project structure.\n\n22\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.733\nI'm gonna make sure that all of my tools\nare working and that everything's running.\n\n23\n00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.326\nSo it's kinda like clearing off your desk,\n\n24\n00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.550\nbefore you really dive in and\nfocus on one thing.\n\n25\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.060\nSo just to make sure things\nare just solved, all right?\n\n26\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.350\nSo I wanna help you accomplish that,\n\n27\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.400\nget everything ready to move on to\nactual implementation, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.570\nSo let's go and\ntake a look at the screen here and well,\n\n29\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.330\nwe have a beautiful background.\n\n30\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.840\nIt kind of makes me miss\nmy home a little bit, but\n\n31\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.450\nthat's all right, that's all right.\n\n32\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.920\nSo what is the first\nthing that we wanna do?\n\n33\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.104\nMy first thing is,\nI'm gonna create a folder.\n\n34\n00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:48.044\nAnd within that folder I wanna create\na couple of things that will help\n\n35\n00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:50.440\nme at this initial stage, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.681\nAnd they're not going to blow your mind,\n\n37\n00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:59.220\nbut I think it would be helpful, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.830\nSo what are we going to do?\n\n39\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.140\nWe are going to hold Cmd, hit Space and\nwe're going to hop into the Terminal.\n\n40\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.820\nWe could do this in Finder, but\nwe have those newly acquired skills\n\n41\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.570\nthat we should be applying\nas soon as possible, right?\n\n42\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.190\nPractice makes permanence,\nbut only does it make\n\n43\n00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.720\nperfection if you practice perfectly, so-\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I like that.\n\n44\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.850\nI don't think I've heard that\nsaying before, I like that.\n\n45\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a matter of fact.\n\n46\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.720\nIf you practice something incorrectly,\nthen you'll learn it incorrectly.\n\n47\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.550\nSo practice makes permanence.\n\n48\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.340\nSo practice perfectly, for\nperfection, there we go.\n\n49\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.472\nAnd there's a lot of Ps in there,\nalliteration, it's your friend.\n\n50\n00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:42.490\nSo I'm gonna zoom in a little bit and\nwe're in my home folder.\n\n51\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.820\nBut just to keep things during these\nprojects, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.270\nmove inside of the Desktop folder,\nand I look around, right with LS.\n\n53\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.580\nNothing there, that's okay.\n\n54\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.640\nNow we have to decide something\nmeaningful for our project folder, so\n\n55\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.709\nI don't get mixed up, all right?\n\n56\n00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.350\nJust don't overthink it at this point.\n\n57\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.180\nIf you know what you're\ngoing to be building,\n\n58\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.370\nlike a game,\njust mkdir hangman, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.080\nSo there's our hangman directory,\nwe come over here, looks good.\n\n60\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.640\nAnd we hop inside of hangman, and\nthere's nothing inside of there.\n\n61\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.550\nNow what do we need for\nthis project at this state?\n\n62\n00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.918\nWell I'm thinking that to start off,\n\n63\n00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:34.218\nwe're going to be simplifying our\napproach and doing small pieces.\n\n64\n00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:36.540\nSo we probably only need\na single Python file.\n\n65\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.541\nAnd there are some specifics to Python in\nthis case, but if you're approaching any\n\n66\n00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:47.058\nother language in any other problem,\nit's going to be something similar.\n\n67\n00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:51.970\nThe complexity might be a little higher\nbecause of certain project requirements.\n\n68\n00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.840\nBut you're gonna name your project,\nyou're gonna go in and\n\n69\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.290\nset up your base level files and\nkinda get things working.\n\n70\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.710\nAll right, so\nI'm going to touch to create that file,\n\n71\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.300\nand I'm gonna call it main.py, why main?\n\n72\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.300\nThat's the main file for this project.\n\n73\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.060\nWhat other things could I call it?\n\n74\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.906\nI could call it game.py,\nI could be calling it hangman.py.\n\n75\n00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:20.982\nI choose main because if I ever have any\nother py files, .py files for Python.\n\n76\n00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:24.762\nI know while the main logic\nis contained within main,\n\n77\n00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:30.818\nthat's the convention that I use, and\nI recommend that you adopt it early on.\n\n78\n00:04:30.818 --> 00:04:34.495\nDoesn't hold for very large projects\nlike enterprise applications,\n\n79\n00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:38.630\n[SOUND] gets a little iffy but\nit will work for us for\n\n80\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.611\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; And you said this is your naming\n\n81\n00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:47.850\nconvention or is this kind of a, maybe\nit's more adopted by most developers?\n\n82\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.677\nOr is it very specific to just you?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n83\n00:04:50.677 --> 00:04:54.860\nthese first projects are going\nto be very simplifying.\n\n84\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.898\nIf you are building something of\nlarger scale, there are platforms or\n\n85\n00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:03.910\ntemplates that people say, build it\nthis way, make these folders and files.\n\n86\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.600\nAnd those are more prescriptive, but\nthey're a little bit overkill for now.\n\n87\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.230\nI like to pick names when I'm\nbuilding something simple, like this,\n\n88\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.260\nthat make make sense to me.\n\n89\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.440\nNow if I come inside the hangman folder\nand I see a main.py, then I go there's\n\n90\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.990\nwhere the main stuff is, all right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n91\n00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.241\n&gt;&gt; And then over time you may reorganize\n\n92\n00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:24.370\nthat, and put in subfolders and\nthings like that.\n\n93\n00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.628\n&gt;&gt; I know by talking to a lot of\n\n94\n00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:29.065\npeople around here, especially Mike,\nthis is what like all people and\n\n95\n00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:31.029\ndatabases pretty much, they adopt it.\n\n96\n00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.476\nSo I'm adopting it, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and do it too.\n\n97\n00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:38.886\nI didn't know how far the scope of\nthe naming conventions went within\n\n98\n00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:44.020\nthe developer world.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some recommendations.\n\n99\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.490\nThey tend to be recommendations\nbased on the scale of your project.\n\n100\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.990\nIn other languages, it may be enforced,\nit says, you have to have this name.\n\n101\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.560\nThat is not the case with Python, per se.\n\n102\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.140\nSo this is kind of a Python leniency that\nwe're afforded because we've chosen Python\n\n103\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.280\nas our first language here.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha,\n\n104\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.210\nin HTML you have to have an index\npage cuz that's your home page where,\n\n105\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.800\nall that kinda fun stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n106\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.450\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n107\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.410\n&gt;&gt; So we're just starting here, and\n\n108\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.480\nthen who knows, it may change over\ntime as projects get more complicated.\n\n109\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.780\nAnd we'll just take it as it goes.\n\n110\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.820\nNow, that may make you uncomfortable\nbecause there's not a single answer.\n\n111\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.190\nThose are good questions to ask.\n\n112\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.080\nBut sometimes there not a cut and dry\nanswer to the question, and that's okay.\n\n113\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.520\nThat's part of software actually.\n\n114\n00:06:29.778 --> 00:06:32.100\nThere may be a right answer,\nthere may not be a right answer,\n\n115\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.420\nis there a best right answer?\n\n116\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.610\nWho knows,\nwe're just doing some exploration.\n\n117\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.039\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always just nod and keep going,\n\n118\n00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:43.090\nbecause otherwise you're going to make\nyour brain hurt if you try to solve it.\n\n119\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.618\nJust accept it and move on.\n\n120\n00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:47.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we're going to accept it.\n\n121\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.906\nWe're gonna make our couple of files here,\nand to some extent,\n\n122\n00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:51.380\nwe're just gonna leave them blank.\n\n123\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.940\nAll right, so we're gonna touch main.py,\nand here's an additional recommendation.\n\n124\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.290\nFor any project,\nI would probably create a readme.txt.\n\n125\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.270\nNow in the long term you may find\nthis takes different formats,\n\n126\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.540\ndifferent versions.\n\n127\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.300\nThink of it as these are the abbreviated\nnotes to describe it to someone else.\n\n128\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.670\nNow we're going to just\nuse that very simply.\n\n129\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.972\nBut for you, you can further expand this,\ndo some planning and\n\n130\n00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.230\nthings of that nature.\n\n131\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.390\nSo there's our two files,\nthat's all we need for now.\n\n132\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.020\nDon't go crazy when you're first\nstarting to build something new.\n\n133\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.107\nI'm gonna zoom out and\nnow I want to open this folder,\n\n134\n00:07:32.107 --> 00:07:36.040\nmake sure that, yeah looks good here.\n\n135\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.290\nI'm gonna open this folder and well,\nwe're gonna open it in our editor.\n\n136\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.920\nSo I'm going back to the Spotlight.\n\n137\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.211\nAnd I'm gonna look up Visual Studio Code\nand I'm going to open it all right?\n\n138\n00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.400\nSo here we are,\nwe're in Visual Studio Code and\n\n139\n00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.510\nat this point I want to File &gt; Open.\n\n140\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.080\nSo I'm gonna open the folder and\nwhere is my Desktop, there we go.\n\n141\n00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.270\nI'm going to click this folder, and\nI'm not going to click any of these files.\n\n142\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.540\nI don't want to open the individual file.\n\n143\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.550\nI want to open the folder, and then\nhave the folder kind of listed for me.\n\n144\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.330\nBe careful about that, and\nI'm going to open here.\n\n145\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.837\nJust going to refresh the page, and\nnow I have these files as such, all right?\n\n146\n00:08:16.837 --> 00:08:20.969\nNow, at this point readme,\nwhat is our readme?\n\n147\n00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:25.380\nAnd I'm just going to make this a little\nbit bigger for us so we can see.\n\n148\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:34.270\nThe readme, well, this is the first pass,\nAt a hangman game, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.150\nWe are going to keep this simple.\n\n150\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.022\nAnd it's important to remind yourself,\n\n151\n00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.240\nbecause if you don't you'll start\nto make things complicated again.\n\n152\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.541\nIn addition to what I would do,\nis I would put a date like today,\n\n153\n00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:52.360\nit's 3/2/18 at 3:04pm.\n\n154\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.048\nI would keep a journal,\nevery time you work on it,\n\n155\n00:08:57.048 --> 00:09:01.800\nwhat are you working on,\nwhat are you doing?\n\n156\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.810\nAnd in particular this is a general thing,\nwe set up the project.\n\n157\n00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:13.090\nRight, that's what we did at this point.\n\n158\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.480\nNow, if you're watching\nthis at a later date,\n\n159\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.520\nyou don't necessarily have\nto type that day and time.\n\n160\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.040\nType your day and time, keep a journal so\nyou can see how you progress.\n\n161\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.320\nKeep track of what your motivation is for\nthat respective setting.\n\n162\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.670\nYou've sat down, remember,\nhave a plan, work the plan, all right?\n\n163\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.580\nSo that's what we're gonna do, and\n\n164\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.930\npart of that is making sure\nthat our Python file is set up.\n\n165\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.260\nAnd sometimes my stuff doesn't load right,\nand I get recommendations,\n\n166\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.560\nand that's alright.\n\n167\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.300\nWe don't really care about any plugins or\nadditions to our editor.\n\n168\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.980\nRight now,\nwe're just going to keep it very simple.\n\n169\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.690\n&gt;&gt; But that was part of this particular\n\n170\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.780\nprogram, that was just saying it wasn't\nliking what you did because you haven't\n\n171\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.760\ndone all of this stuff.\n\n172\n00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.340\nWow, that was a really\nprofound statement wasn't it?\n\n173\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.950\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what.\n\n174\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.860\nI think we're just gonna go ahead and\nshut it down now after that one.\n\n175\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.856\nBut yeah, Visual Studio Code will\ntypically give you recommendations.\n\n176\n00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:09.700\nHey, you should check this out,\nyou should check this out.\n\n177\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.260\nWe're gonna leave it be for\nnow because we don't need it.\n\n178\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.200\nAnd that's all right,\nbut what am I gonna do?\n\n179\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.730\nThere's a couple of things that\nI always put in a Python file,\n\n180\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.880\nespecially if it's going to\nbe the main running file.\n\n181\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.542\nI create a main, that's tiny, tiny.\n\n182\n00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.290\nI create a main function, all right?\n\n183\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:34.472\nAnd I type pass, and I'm gonna say\n\n184\n00:10:34.472 --> 00:10:39.500\n__main__ = __name__.\n\n185\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.230\nNow what is this doing?\n\n186\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.120\nThis is making sure that only if\nthis is the actual running file that\n\n187\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.810\nyou mean to run,\ndoes it run this function.\n\n188\n00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.580\nWhen I type this, I need to check it out.\n\n189\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.940\nI need to make sure that it works.\n\n190\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.989\nI'm gonna come over here\nback to the Terminal.\n\n191\n00:10:59.989 --> 00:11:06.625\nAnd let me zoom in and\nwe're gonna type python3 main.py, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:11.456\nBoom, and if main, actually,\nI got things a little\n\n193\n00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:16.400\nbackwards on us, that's all right,\nthese things happen.\n\n194\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.932\nAnd if then happens to you,\nit's important to note these errors,\n\n195\n00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:23.690\nNameError: name ' __main\n__' is not defined.\n\n196\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.660\nWhy is it not defined?\n\n197\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.410\nCuz it's not done __main__.\n\n198\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.970\nNotice how it hits that blue,\nthat light blue in your editor.\n\n199\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.730\nRich text editors are handy for that.\n\n200\n00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.600\nBut now we're gonna come back over here,\nand we're gonna rerun this file.\n\n201\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.230\nAnd this is a no news is good news.\n\n202\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.830\nWe have no error, we're good to go.\n\n203\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.689\nNow, there is nothing that prints out so\n\n204\n00:11:45.689 --> 00:11:49.230\nI know that the file\nisn't broken syntax-wise.\n\n205\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.594\nBut does it actually do\nanything if I wanted it to?\n\n206\n00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:58.690\nThis is my second check when I'm setting\nup a project that's necessary to make\n\n207\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:04.170\nsure when I start my implementation phase,\nthat I don't end up with an unexpected,\n\n208\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.060\nhm, this isn't working kind of things,\nright?\n\n209\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.200\nI am working, I actually like that phrase\nbecause it's kind of a confirmation\n\n210\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.560\nthat it actually is working,\nand everything's good to go.\n\n211\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.669\nAll right, so I'm gonna hop back\nover here to the Terminal and\n\n212\n00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:21.290\nI'm going to type python3 main.py.\n\n213\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.740\nAll right, I am working.\n\n214\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.820\nI have my main function which\nis the main portion of our game.\n\n215\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.340\nI've used the word main a great deal.\n\n216\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.150\nAnd this is again, one of those,\nI've seen this convention,\n\n217\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.130\nI've adopted this convention.\n\n218\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.815\nSo I have a main.py file,\nI have a main function in it.\n\n219\n00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:47.346\nAnd that main function\nonly runs if the file is\n\n220\n00:12:47.346 --> 00:12:51.170\nthe one listed like this, all right.\n\n221\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:58.650\nSo main.py runs the main function only\nif I type this on the Terminal, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.160\nSo that's our set up.\n\n223\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.150\nWe have everything ready to go, let's\ncheck our readme, that's what we did.\n\n224\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.320\nAnd now you make sure that the file runs,\nthat there is no errors.\n\n225\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.051\nAnd we can kinda create a check point for\nourselves and go, all right,\n\n226\n00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:15.780\nwe got a small victory here.\n\n227\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.950\nWe're good to go, we can now start\nworking on our simplified implementation\n\n228\n00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.491\nof hangman.\n&gt;&gt; And that last whole thing you were\n\n229\n00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:24.886\ntalking about, the test,\nit's almost a hello world.\n\n230\n00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:30.562\nI'm testing the broadcast and making\nsure that the Terminal finds it and it's\n\n231\n00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:33.690\nkind of a, was it loopbacks or finder?\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n232\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.040\nlike a feedback loop.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n233\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so it's funny when people\n\n234\n00:13:37.897 --> 00:13:42.700\nare like, you do the same thing\nevery time you start something new.\n\n235\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.270\nI'm like, yeah.\n\n236\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.970\nBecause I know if I can't get it to\nrun something simple like print,\n\n237\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.902\nI am working,\nthen it's not gonna run anything else.\n\n238\n00:13:51.902 --> 00:13:54.630\nIf I accidentally make a typo,\nI wanna catch it early and\n\n239\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.800\noften, instead of later, and\nthen it just makes me angry.\n\n240\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.380\nAnd I also make sure that none of\nmy tooling has breakages, right?\n\n241\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.960\nComputers are not necessarily perfect.\n\n242\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.270\nMaybe you installed something\nthat affected something else.\n\n243\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.060\nSo I always check this\nvery simple example.\n\n244\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.170\nAnd that way,\nyou don't have to worry about, okay,\n\n245\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.020\nI know it works at this point,\nlet's move forward.\n\n246\n00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.950\nYou don't have to go,\nwell I just wrote code for six days, and\n\n247\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.250\nthen I tested it out at the end of\nthe sixth day and it didn't work.\n\n248\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.780\nAnd I spent the last nine days trying\nto figure out why it doesn't work.\n\n249\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.110\nSo small little checkpoints,\nsmall victories.\n\n250\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.471\nWell, and we have one here, so I think\nnow is a good time to [SOUND] celebrate.\n\n251\n00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:37.180\nAnd we'll come start and\nstart our implementation\n\n252\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.250\nof our basic hangman game.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n253\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.050\nwell I definitely like those\nsmall victories, for sure.\n\n254\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.890\nOkay, we set it up,\nthat's all we need to do.\n\n255\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.090\nOkay, perfect, well then,\nwe're gonna hop on out of there.\n\n256\n00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.115\nAll right, thank you so\nmuch, wrapping it up.\n\n257\n00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:51.426\nThis has been DevPro.TV,\n\n258\n00:14:51.426 --> 00:14:56.157\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt;

today?\n\n11\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.740\nI'm doing pretty good,\nI guess you're gonna tell us\n\n12\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.110\nhow we're going to set up our game,\nand we went through kinda planning it,\n\n13\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.370\nand what we want them to do them,\nwhen were they gonna input things.\n\n14\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.390\nSo I thought that was a really\nnice way to get it started.\n\n15\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.550\nWe've started our implementation, so\nnow we need to figure out our guesses.\n\n16\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.280\nYou would be guessing right.\n\n17\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.510\nAnd well, our guesses are gonna\nbe a little simpler than that.\n\n18\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.750\nWe're actually going to just\ntrying to grab a single letter\n\n19\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.530\nfrom an individual and\njust get it on the screen, right?\n\n20\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.190\nNow, there are some other things that\nmay occur, we're not gonna look for\n\n21\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.120\ncorrectness or anything just yet.\n\n22\n00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.420\nBut I wanna be able to say, hey give me\na guess, and then give it back, too, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.470\nSo part of this will morph as we\ncontinue creating this project,\n\n24\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.652\nbut that's our first step.\n\n25\n00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:24.780\nWe're gonna focus just on that,\nand that way, we don't get kind\n\n26\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.600\nof overwhelmed with, I also need to do x,\ny, and z, and all these other things.\n\n27\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.110\nSo even though this may change,\nthat's our ultimate goal in this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.442\nSee, I was already going,\nthis is on the bottom,\n\n29\n00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:40.437\nwhere we're going to tell them\nhow many guesses they have guess.\n\n30\n00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:43.620\nNo, this is just,\nthey're guessing a letter.\n\n31\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.710\nThey're going to click the letter A on\nthe keyboard, and we want A to show up.\n\n32\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.060\nBut don't worry,\nwe're not doing if it's correct yet.\n\n33\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.250\nNope, we're just kinda putting\nthings on the board, right?\n\n34\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.230\nSo taking a guess and\nkind of regurgitating it out.\n\n35\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.130\nIt's almost like an echo chamber so\nto speak, but what we're gonna learn is\n\n36\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.750\na few little bits about the game dynamics,\nbut also taking user input using Python.\n\n37\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.260\nSee, I'm already overcomplicating things,\nI always do this, so I'm so\n\n38\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.630\nglad you're here to help me keep focus,\nand let's take one step at a time.\n\n39\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.120\nSo let's go, [LAUGH].\n\n40\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.000\nWell hopefully I can deliver on that,\nand I agree with you, I think we should,\n\n41\n00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.720\nthere's no better time\nthan now to get started.\n\n42\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.740\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here And\n\n43\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.250\nremind ourselves quickly\nwhere we left off.\n\n44\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.720\nI'm inside of the hangman folder,\nwhich is on my desktop.\n\n45\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.030\nAnd we have a main.py.\n\n46\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.430\nLet's zoom in just a little bit here.\n\n47\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.800\nA main.py and a readme.txt.\n\n48\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.035\nNow I'm gonna try to keep journal.\n\n49\n00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:45.082\nRight now, I want to do as I'm asking\nyou to do, or suggest that you do,\n\n50\n00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:47.410\nin order to keep track of things.\n\n51\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.190\nAnd then, inside of this are these two\nfiles are inside of the hangman folder\n\n52\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.930\nwhich is on our desktop.\n\n53\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.160\nNow, grand scheme I'll probably move\nthis somewhere else, but that's just so\n\n54\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.780\nwe have quick access to\nit here on the show.\n\n55\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.660\nAll right, so we're gonna zoom back\nout and we're going to hop over.\n\n56\n00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.720\nI'm using a different desktop so\nI can have full screen for this.\n\n57\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.450\nSo if you have them side by side,\n\n58\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.870\nthat's perfectly okay, as far as your\nterminal and your Visual Studio code.\n\n59\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.410\nBut, I'm just doing it so that you\ncan see when they're a little nicer.\n\n60\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.270\nSo we have this def main(),\nthat's our main function.\n\n61\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.840\nAnd it's running if the name\nof the file is main.\n\n62\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.230\nSo that's if I type Python main.py.\n\n63\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.760\nTotally different in different contexts,\nbut that's all we need to know for now.\n\n64\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.440\nNow inside of this readme,\nwhat are we doing today?\n\n65\n00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.240\nWell, let's see, what is today, Vonne?\n\n66\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.020\nIt's the 5th, isn't it, I think?\n\n67\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.870\nYes, I had to look at my computer.\n\n68\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.030\nGlad I had my little calendar icon right\ndown there, know what day it is [LAUGH].\n\n69\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.860\nAnd we are on the fifth.\n\n70\n00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.070\nWe are going to start taking user guesses.\n\n71\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.160\nAnd echoing them back out, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.890\nSo let's actually break that onto a new\nline, and then there we go, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.510\nShould we, just for my purposes,\nI would be guessing a letter.\n\n74\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.190\nIn the sense of, we're not tracking our\nguesses right now, the user will guess\n\n75\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.140\na letter of the word that is what\nthey're playing for [LAUGH].\n\n76\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.470\nAnd actually,\nbeing clear is a very, right.\n\n77\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.690\nI'm bad about that,\nbecause I know what I mean.\n\n78\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.060\nBut you should try to be clear, so\nwe're gonna take user letter guesses, and\n\n79\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.980\nechoing the single letter\nback to the screen, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.040\nJust like that, just like that,\nand we're all good to go, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.740\nNow this may seem very simplistic,\n\n82\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.370\nbut there's probably gonna be a little\nmore to it than one would think.\n\n83\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.720\nBecause you have to think,\nhow am I going to elicit user guesses,\n\n84\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.430\nhow am I going to kinda\nkeep these things going.\n\n85\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.510\nSo here we go, we're gonna come\nin to main.py and well first off\n\n86\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.410\nwe're gonna do everything that our main\nfunction is more less our game, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.870\nSo how do I grab user input?\n\n88\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.610\nAnd so let's just call it a letter,\nand we're gonna say input, and\n\n89\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.460\nwe're gonna give a prompt,\nplease enter the letter\n\n90\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.210\nthat you wish to guess, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.120\nAnd I'm gonna move that out of\nthe way there, there we go.\n\n92\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.883\nSo boom, all right we're good to go.\n\n93\n00:05:29.883 --> 00:05:35.357\nNow, let's see how this behaves and\nPython main.py,\n\n94\n00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:42.485\nand all I'm gonna have is this little\nprompt here and I can type A letter.\n\n95\n00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:45.460\nAnd the name A is not defined.\n\n96\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.100\nWell that's kind of interesting.\n\n97\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.280\nSo, let's go check this out because I\nmay have typed something a little odd.\n\n98\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.030\nSo, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.930\nSo letter equals input, and\n\n100\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.640\neverything looks good to go\nexcept name A is not defined.\n\n101\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.650\nThat is kind of an hard thing here.\n\n102\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.730\nSo let's fix this up a little bit.\n\n103\n00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.890\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n104\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.480\nLet's try that again,\ntrusting it a little bit different.\n\n105\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.040\nAnd there we go, an A.\n\n106\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.490\nOkay, A is not defines.\n\n107\n00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.420\nAll right.\n\n108\n00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.280\nSo, if we- Was this\nsupposed to be working?\n\n109\n00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.960\nYeah.\nBecause I'm just gonna say,\n\n110\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.810\nI'm thinking all you're asking for\nis the input, so\n\n111\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.470\nit's just asking for the prompt which\njust goes like this is all I need to do.\n\n112\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.792\nI kind of assumed that there\nneeded to be more code for\n\n113\n00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:39.294\nit to accept you typing in the letter\nA and doing something with it,\n\n114\n00:06:39.294 --> 00:06:43.240\nor maybe I'm just not\nfamiliar with it as much.\n\n115\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.740\n[LAUGH] This is one of the strong points\nof Python, it abstracts away things.\n\n116\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.408\nAnd ultimately what it's doing,\nit's reading in for this input.\n\n117\n00:06:54.408 --> 00:06:57.290\nNow, I will tell you because\nwe're using Python 3, but\n\n118\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.150\nsometimes a lot of systems\ncome with Python 2.\n\n119\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.640\nI suspect I know what's going on,\nall right?\n\n120\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.330\nAnd this is my fault.\n\n121\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.200\nBut I do want to take a moment and\nsay, well input.\n\n122\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.600\nThis is how you take command\nline input from a user.\n\n123\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.250\nIt should take that input and\nreturn it here.\n\n124\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.110\nExcept we're getting an error, right?\n\n125\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.180\nWe're getting weird errors.\n\n126\n00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.500\nAnd lets go see if my\nthought process is correct.\n\n127\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.300\nIf I look here, right, Python main.py.\n\n128\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.190\nWell, if you ever run into this and\nthis is important.\n\n129\n00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.970\nSo, we're gonna leave this here.\n\n130\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.460\nI'll type python --version, like this and\nknows how that this is 2.7.\n\n131\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.660\nHere's a little bit of a difference.\n\n132\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.540\nIn some of these things for Python 2, and\nPython 3 we mean to use python three.\n\n133\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.310\nSo, we're getting errors,\nwhoopsy daisy, and there we go.\n\n134\n00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.310\nLet's try it, and if I'm correct,\nthen this should work without error.\n\n135\n00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.810\nIf I'm incorrect, well, then we may go\nahead and pack it up and go to the house.\n\n136\n00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.870\nSo boom, and please enter a letter,\nA and notice there's no longer an error,\n\n137\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.000\nbecause all it did was it slurped up\nwhat I typed in until I hit enter.\n\n138\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.290\nAnd then,\nI'm just kind of into the program.\n\n139\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.700\nOkay, so that was the function, or\n\n140\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.050\nthe functionality of that,\nwould we call it a keyword?\n\n141\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.860\nOr input, the command,\n\n142\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.550\nor- Input is a built-in function that\ntakes input from a command line.\n\n143\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.620\nOkay.\nAnd then until you hit Enter,\n\n144\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.490\nit's just kind of waiting for\nyou to fill out this line.\n\n145\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.250\nAnd then you go, click, enter and\nit slurps that up and it returns it.\n\n146\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.950\nOkay, so you wanted to emphasize the whole\nidea that you have to make sure that\n\n147\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.285\nyou're running the right version of\nPython When you're running the command and\n\n148\n00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:45.989\nthat was the lesson here and\nyou did that on purpose.\n\n149\n00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:49.077\nWe're gonna go with I did it on purpose.\n\n150\n00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:51.098\nOkay [LAUGH] But\nit gets me all the time too and\n\n151\n00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:54.502\nit may get you as well, especially\nif you're working in Macs or Linux\n\n152\n00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:59.332\nland where there are probably already\npre-built-in Pythons that may be running.\n\n153\n00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:04.362\nBut we're trying to use Python 3, keeping\nup to date, so if you run into errors and\n\n154\n00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:05.882\nyou're like wow that should work,\n\n155\n00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:08.652\nmake sure you're using\nthe right Python executable.\n\n156\n00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:10.352\nYes, we've turned this\ninto a teachable moment,\n\n157\n00:09:10.352 --> 00:09:15.152\nwhen it's one of those like,\noops I forgot about that, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n158\n00:09:15.152 --> 00:09:17.830\nBut really I will remember this one.\n\n159\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.000\nSo- Yeah, so that's the key purpose.\n\n160\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.080\nAll right, so\nI think we have an input here.\n\n161\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.780\nI said we had an input,\nI made an assertion.\n\n162\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.860\nBut if we come back and we look,\nhow do I print this out to the screen?\n\n163\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.480\nHow do I echo this back?\n\n164\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.130\nWell, I can print letter,\njust like that, all right?\n\n165\n00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.990\nSo if I come back and I rerun this, and\n\n166\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.850\nlet's zoom in just a little bit, and\nI rerun this, A and it prints out A.\n\n167\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.020\nLet's rerun it, B and it prints out B.\n\n168\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.170\nIf I rerun it and put lowercase\na it prints out lowercase a, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.300\nThere is one thing I want\nyou to be aware of, and\n\n170\n00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.940\nsometimes you have to make sacrifices.\n\n171\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.990\nIf I say abcd, it's what?\n\n172\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.370\nIt's abcd.\n\n173\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.440\nSo we have to keep that in mind as we\nfurther developing taking user input.\n\n174\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.990\nIt's like you read my mind, because I'm\nlike well, there must be something that,\n\n175\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.450\nokay, you could probably type\nin more than just one letter, so\n\n176\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.110\nthere'd be something down\nthe road that you're limiting\n\n177\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.500\nit to a single character that they can\ninput, and maybe you're going too far.\n\n178\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.880\nTest to make sure it's an actual letter\nand not a number or something like that,\n\n179\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.140\nvalidation of these things.\n\n180\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.760\nWe could, but you know what?\n\n181\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.224\nI think there's certain- I'm\ngoing overboard, aren't I?\n\n182\n00:10:30.224 --> 00:10:32.576\n[LAUGH] Vonne, you'll be like,\nwe're doing so much.\n\n183\n00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:33.460\nI don't know what's going on!\n\n184\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.870\nBut, we now have a very\ncore functionality.\n\n185\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.830\nBut there is still one problem that I see.\n\n186\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.980\nIf you have a five-letter word\nthat you're guessing, all right.\n\n187\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.160\nWhat happens as soon as I\nguess anything right now,\n\n188\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.860\nit goes, okay there's a guess and\nprogram exit, program's done.\n\n189\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.840\nSo this is where in game,\nyou kind of have this going over, and\n\n190\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.990\nover, and over until you win,\nor until you loss.\n\n191\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.400\nUnless I use the until word,\nwhen you hear until,\n\n192\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.190\nwhen you think of until,\nyou should think of iteration, all right?\n\n193\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:14.840\nSo I think Vonne, what might be better is,\nif I take the ability to collect a lot of\n\n194\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.920\nuser's guesses, and then print those\nout when the user is done, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.130\nOr until we win, right?\n\n196\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.880\nSo how does one do that?\n\n197\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.450\nWell you make a game loop.\n\n198\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.970\nAnd typically a game loop\nis just an infinite loop.\n\n199\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.930\nTypically, we discourage this.\n\n200\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:34.430\nBut guess what?\n\n201\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.910\nIn games, essentially what you're\nwaiting for is user input, and\n\n202\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.900\nthen you respond to them.\n\n203\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.540\nAnd guess what?\n\n204\n00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.870\nThis letter equals input,\nthis is called a blocking function.\n\n205\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.510\nIt will actually stop on that line\nuntil the user provides input.\n\n206\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.610\nAnd because of that,\nthen I can come here, and\n\n207\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:03.270\nthat was command-shift-right arrow\nto select everything and command-x.\n\n208\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.090\nSo if I come here and\n\n209\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.060\nput this here, this infinite while\nloop will not run away with me.\n\n210\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.590\nNow, there's some other\nprogramming languages where\n\n211\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.900\nthis will still do weird stuff.\n\n212\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.780\nBut in Python, this is typically how\na gain loop works while true, or\n\n213\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.750\nwhile running.\n\n214\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.070\nWe'll, eventually abstract this away.\n\n215\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:27.050\nBut now I can take a bunch of user inputs,\nand as a matter of fact, let's just try\n\n216\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:33.030\nto visualize, I want to take user inputs\nand kind of collect those together, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:38.066\nSo how about, let's call an output,\nwe'll get rid of this\n\n218\n00:12:38.066 --> 00:12:42.801\neventually, we're gonna\nstart it as an empty string,\n\n219\n00:12:42.801 --> 00:12:47.655\nand then all we're gonna do is say,\noutput += letter.\n\n220\n00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:50.620\nAnd let's go through this,\nwe're gonna start with nothing, right?\n\n221\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.960\nAn empty string.\n\n222\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.030\nAnd for every letter that the user inputs,\nwe're gonna add that to the output, so\n\n223\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.168\nwe can kind of keep a tally\nof what they've said.\n\n224\n00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:03.190\nThis isn't gonna serve our purposes\nin the long term, I don't think.\n\n225\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.590\nBut this will give us\nan idea of what's going on.\n\n226\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:13.840\nSo if we print, not letter,\nbut output, just like that,\n\n227\n00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.750\nat the end of every loop, we're gonna see,\nwhat have you guessed thus far?\n\n228\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.170\nWhat have you guessed thus far?\n\n229\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:25.140\nAnd if we come back, and Python 3,\nand let's zoom in just a little bit so\n\n230\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.970\nwe can make sure everybody sees,\nand Vonne will trigger letter.\n\n231\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:29.614\nV.\n\n232\n00:13:29.614 --> 00:13:34.600\nAll right, V for Vonne, and notice\nwe're now directly back to the prompt.\n\n233\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.120\nIf we weren't back to the prompt\nthe program would exit, so\n\n234\n00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.430\nnow our game is running.\n\n235\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.110\nWe are playing until\nsomething stops the play.\n\n236\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.400\nSo I typed a V, and let's put a J and\nnotice it's printing.\n\n237\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.850\nWell it started out as we accumulated\nall V, we accumulated all J,\n\n238\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.410\nwe accumulated all anything else.\n\n239\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.150\nLet's just say abd, and\nthen we could even do 1, 2,\n\n240\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.140\n3, but as Vonne alluded to,\nlong term that may not work out for\n\n241\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.210\nus, but\nwe have an infinite kind of loop here.\n\n242\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.497\nAnd an infinite loop that's always taking\nusers' guesses until we're done, okay?\n\n243\n00:14:14.497 --> 00:14:20.090\nNow, I don't know if we want this\nto run around like this, right?\n\n244\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.170\nLet's see here.\n\n245\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.860\nLet's scroll back out and\ninstead of while True.\n\n246\n00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.850\nHow would one set up a break point?\n\n247\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.760\nWhile I'm thinking, we started the game.\n\n248\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.760\nHow would I determine the end to the game?\n\n249\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.240\nLet's just create something artificial, so\nwe can kinda get a feel for the dynamics.\n\n250\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:50.470\nLet's say, if the length of\noutput is &gt; 10 then break.\n\n251\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.102\nAnd now, after the game has ended,\nso after the game has ended.\n\n252\n00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:04.550\nThen print out a message,\nright just like that.\n\n253\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.510\nSo print, and\nwe're just gonna print the output, and\n\n254\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:13.760\nmaybe because we don't have a limitation,\nfor now we can say congratulations,\n\n255\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.130\nthat was a horrible\ncongratulations wasn't it.\n\n256\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:25.990\nYou won with the word and just like that.\n\n257\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.800\nThere we go.\n\n258\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.270\nNope, let's try that one more time.\n\n259\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.890\nThere we go, there we go.\n\n260\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.400\nSo this will actually print a couple,\nbut we'll stay here for now.\n\n261\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.370\nAll right, so I now have the very basics\nof being able to take a game, right?\n\n262\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:46.650\nTake user guesses, and at some point\nstop taking user guesses with logic.\n\n263\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.750\nBut I only focused on that,\nI know it's just a few lines of code.\n\n264\n00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.590\nAnd part of that is an artifact of Python,\n\n265\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.950\npart of it is our games a little\nsimpler now because we just said,\n\n266\n00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.530\nlets just just focus on these things,\nbut now I can test this.\n\n267\n00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.300\nInstead of writing a whole\nbunch of code before I test,\n\n268\n00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.750\nnotice I've already re-ran\nmy code several times.\n\n269\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.060\nAnd that's what you should do\nas you're starting building.\n\n270\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.970\nSo how do I get out of here, because\noriginally, I have no way of stopping?\n\n271\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.682\nWell, when in doubt,\nif you're running this, Ctrl+C.\n\n272\n00:16:18.682 --> 00:16:23.080\nCtrl + C will kind of just, panic,\nrun away, get out of there.\n\n273\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.655\nIt's actually called a keyboard interrupt,\njust like we have here.\n\n274\n00:16:26.655 --> 00:16:31.620\nSo ctrl+C, Mac whatever, ctrl+C is\na keyboard interrupt and will actually get\n\n275\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.870\nyou out of that infinite loop, because\nthere was no other termination conditions.\n\n276\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.110\nSo that's something,\na key point to remember.\n\n277\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.590\nThat's not command C\nfrom Mac Controls it's\n\n278\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.730\nall across the board you're saying,\ncontrol.\n\n279\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.710\nYes, ctrl + C.\n\n280\n00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.530\nCtrl + C for keyboard interact.\n\n281\n00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.450\nNow, for disclosure there are times where\nyou may get into a very intensive loop\n\n282\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.890\nthat's running really fast, or\n\n283\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.460\nthere's some other things going\non that that doesn't work.\n\n284\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.140\nAt that point you probably\nhave to open task manager or\n\n285\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.700\nsomething like that, or worse comes\nto worse you may want to reboot.\n\n286\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.880\nBut I'm not gonna lead you astray.\n\n287\n00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.440\nBut I'm just letting you\nknow if that doesn't work,\n\n288\n00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.036\nthen that means there's a whole lot\nof things running out of control.\n\n289\n00:17:08.036 --> 00:17:11.540\nOf course, ctrl+C, I'm always thinking\ncopy, but if you can think like close.\n\n290\n00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.065\nLike close it,\nlet's start anew close it down,\n\n291\n00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:18.160\nctrl+C Yeah, close it down, shut her down.\n\n292\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.770\nAlright, so what I'm gonna do\nis actually clear this out.\n\n293\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.425\nRight, and say python main .py, and\n\n294\n00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:31.955\nplease enter the letter you wish to guess.\n\n295\n00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:34.505\nSo I'm gonna say A, and A is not defined.\n\n296\n00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:36.475\nWhat happened, I did the same thing again.\n\n297\n00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:37.785\nI was gonna catch you Justin, but\n\n298\n00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:40.705\nI was like maybe he's doing\nthis on purpose again.\n\n299\n00:17:40.705 --> 00:17:41.755\nI'm like you forgot the three.\n\n300\n00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:47.055\nNo, no that's one of those things where\na lot of times when I update a version I\n\n301\n00:17:47.055 --> 00:17:47.735\nswitch it around.\n\n302\n00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:51.550\nBut I'm leaving that here because these\nare things that you may encounter.\n\n303\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.260\nSo let's Python 3, let's try the letter a,\nthe letter A, letter B, C.\n\n304\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.436\nAnd now, we know when it gets to\nten that it will, congratulations,\n\n305\n00:18:01.436 --> 00:18:05.275\nyou won with the word abcd,\nnumber one that would be\n\n306\n00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:09.920\na horrible Hangman or- [INAUDIBLE]\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] But,\n\n307\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.616\nwe essentially have the dynamics of\ntaking a guess, aggregating the guesses\n\n308\n00:18:14.616 --> 00:18:19.500\nin some manner, and then terminating\nour game based on, well there it is.\n\n309\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.610\nLittle disclosure, the logic in\nthe longterm, may become a little more\n\n310\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:30.250\ncomplex as far as determining what letters\nare what, and so on and so forth, okay?\n\n311\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.930\nSo, that's important to know.\n\n312\n00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.430\nBut we have been able to take guesses from\nsingle letter guesses, we haven't tested\n\n313\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.580\nsingle letter, so we're kind of\noffloading that to the user for now.\n\n314\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.280\nWe take guesses,\nwe're in an infinite game loop, and\n\n315\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.250\nat some point there's\na termination condition.\n\n316\n00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.860\nWe have the core, kind of the kernel,\nof our game ready to go and\n\n317\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.180\nwell, we just have to\nbuild on it from here.\n\n318\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.590\nBut I think we're gonna\nhave to come back for\n\n319\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.850\nanother episode in order\nto further explore that.\n\n320\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.060\nNice, well this is really\nemphasizing the point of, hey,\n\n321\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.610\nyou really need to take\nthis like one little piece.\n\n322\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.450\nI'm already going,\nyou need to do this, this.\n\n323\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.120\nNo, keep it simple.\n\n324\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.240\nStart from little pieces that you can do,\nand then build upon it.\n\n325\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.720\nSo that's the biggest lesson for\nme right now, watching all this,\n\n326\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.610\nlike don't get ahead of yourself.\n\n327\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.700\nTry and\nmake sure you can get something to run and\n\n328\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.870\nmake sure you do Python 3 and ctrl+C.\n\n329\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.420\nI've learned quite a few little things,\nso I'm excited for\n\n330\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.840\nour next episodes where\nwe're gonna move on.\n\n331\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.230\nBut we're going to wrap this one up.\n\n332\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.030\nSigning off for DevPro TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n333\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.790\nAnd I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n334\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.956\nAnd we'll see you soon.\n\n335\n00:19:34.956 --> 00:19:41.226\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting edition of DevProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:19.137\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n5\n00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:23.130\nwe're moving through our applied\nfundamentals series with our hangman game.\n\n6\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.900\nAnd in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.940\nwe're gonna determine if our letter\nguesses are actually correct.\n\n8\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.130\nAnd here to be all correct about\neverything is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n9\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.830\nHow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.560\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic,\nVonne, how are you today?\n\n11\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.570\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\nI put a lot of pressure on you saying that\n\n12\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.931\neverything you say, out of your mouth,\nis going to be correct.\n\n13\n00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:42.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know about that,\nyou might be over selling it and\n\n14\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.190\nI could under deliver on that.\n\n15\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.910\nWell sometimes that's just how we roll.\n\n16\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.710\nBut yeah, ultimately on this episode\nwe're trying to determine whether we have\n\n17\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470\ncorrect guesses, right?\n\n18\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.910\nIn the last episode,\nwe were able to grab letter guesses.\n\n19\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.150\nWe hadn't quite figured out the way to\nkeep people guessing more than one letter.\n\n20\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.390\nWell, we'll figure that out later, right?\n\n21\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.760\nBut we were able to take guesses.\n\n22\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.980\nWe went into our implemented game loop.\n\n23\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.290\nBut now, we don't really know\nwhether it's contained or not.\n\n24\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.010\nAnd we're gonna take this piecemeal, so\ncould be a little more code than we had in\n\n25\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.720\nthe last episode, because number one,\nthe only way we can determine if we have\n\n26\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.180\ncorrect guesses is first,\nby checking that we have a word, right?\n\n27\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nwe're going to need to establish that\n\n28\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520\nthis is the word that they\nare guessing against or for I guess.\n\n29\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\nSo just a randomingly grab a word.\n\n30\n00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.450\nNow if you were running this,\n\n31\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.530\nhad a two player, maybe someone was\nrunning it and could check the work.\n\n32\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.440\nBut that's not real fun.\n\n33\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.650\nThe entire purpose of computer\nprograms is to automate some of that.\n\n34\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.460\nTo remove that need for another player.\n\n35\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.990\nAnd well, that's probably our first\nimportant step is hey, is this the word?\n\n36\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.110\nIs that letter in the word?\n\n37\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.240\nAnd we'll figure that in just a moment.\n\n38\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.270\nAll right, so let's actually\ncome down to the screen here,\n\n39\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.150\nand let's go to our readme.\n\n40\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.640\nAnd this is kind of breaking the illusion\nof television I suppose, and\n\n41\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.010\nI'm not gonna put the time just\nto keep that illusion going.\n\n42\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:16.300\nBut we are going to accomplish the\nfollowing, because I know this is a list,\n\n43\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.310\nand we're going to select a random letter,\nor select a random word, right?\n\n44\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.310\nBecause we have to have that\nin order to determine, hey,\n\n45\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.610\nis the letter correct, right?\n\n46\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.630\nIs the letter contained within the word?\n\n47\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.844\nAnd then we're going to determine\nif the user's guess letter\n\n48\n00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:42.615\nIs in the word, and then, finally, maybe,\n\n49\n00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:49.350\nit's best if we, I don't know,\nmake the screen snazzy.\n\n50\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.510\nScreen snazzification.\n\n51\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.380\nIs that word?\n\n52\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.460\nWe're gong to go with it.\n\n53\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.930\n&gt;&gt; It's a word in my book,\nso I say, let's snazz it up.\n\n54\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Snazz it up.\n\n55\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.880\nNow, let me further clarify\nwhat I mean by snazzification.\n\n56\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.510\nRight now, we're just taking one right\nafter the other right after the other\n\n57\n00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.280\nright after the other.\n\n58\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.950\nAnd that's all right, but it would almost\nbe nice that after I take a letter, right?\n\n59\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.070\nAnd some decisions are made, I just\nclear the screen and start over again.\n\n60\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.550\nAnd we can actually do that with Python.\n\n61\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.570\nWe don't have to do that by ourselves.\n\n62\n00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.950\nWe can just clear the terminal,\nand then boom.\n\n63\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.610\nOkay, so, let's actually figure out how\nwe're going to select this random word.\n\n64\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.850\nNow I'm going to start small and\n\n65\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.990\nthen you can expand this to\nhowever large you want it.\n\n66\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.050\nFull disclosure when I say random\nbecause a computer is involved\n\n67\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.130\nit's not really random.\n\n68\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.940\nIt's pseudo random, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.560\nSo let's create something\ncalled a word list.\n\n70\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.400\nBecause in order to select a random word.\n\n71\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.060\nProbably best if we have a set\nof words to select from, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.900\nSo I'm just going to say cheese.\n\n73\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.125\nOne of my favorites.\n\n74\n00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.220\nVonne, would you like to\nhave a word in this list?\n\n75\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.950\n&gt;&gt; I would go with apple.\n\n76\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.230\n&gt;&gt; Apple, we're gonna go with it.\n\n77\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.020\nThat's all right.\n\n78\n00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.800\nAnd then.\n\n79\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.080\n&gt;&gt; And then I go orange.\n\n80\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.643\n&gt;&gt; Orange.\n\n81\n00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:59.974\n&gt;&gt; Those are the passwords that I always\nset when we're doing document security.\n\n82\n00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:01.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n83\n00:04:01.638 --> 00:04:04.022\n&gt;&gt; Apple and orange so I can remember.\n\n84\n00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:05.238\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n85\n00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:08.180\nI was going to say pomegranate but\nI can't spell pomegranate.\n\n86\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.220\nSo let's go banana all right so\ncheese, apple, orange, and banana.\n\n87\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.030\nThose are our words.\n\n88\n00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.780\nThose are the words we can select from.\n\n89\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.190\nNotice those are not in the main function,\nthose are just up at the top and\n\n90\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.510\nto follow a convention, whoa,\ninstead of deleting that I'm actually\n\n91\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.390\ngoing to make this all caps with undercase\nto say hey, this is like a constant.\n\n92\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.920\nThis is something we're going to be\nusing that you shouldn't just read from.\n\n93\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.130\nAnd Python doesn't allow you to\nmake that quite as unmutable.\n\n94\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.790\nUnless I made it a tuple.\n\n95\n00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.140\nA tuple, I cannot change.\n\n96\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.220\nI just change those to parenthesis, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.830\nWhat do I have?\n\n98\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.900\nI have a word list that is cheese,\napple, orange, and banana, okay.\n\n99\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.570\nNow Vonne, you're kind of giving\nme the stink eye off camera there.\n\n100\n00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.020\nIs there something that I missed?\n\n101\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.020\nDefinitely, hit me up.\n\n102\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.070\n&gt;&gt; I was just curious, when you talk\nabout when making it all uppper case,\n\n103\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.570\nis that just kind of like your\nown way of like a kind of\n\n104\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.590\nconvention that you're using to say\nthis is I want to say a global variable?\n\n105\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.510\nI don't know if I'm using\nthe wrong terminology here but?\n\n106\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.750\n&gt;&gt; So, uppercase with underscores\nlike this are typically constants.\n\n107\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.990\nNow, you may find some people who\ndo not adopt this convention but\n\n108\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.570\nit's a pretty common convention.\n\n109\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.940\nUppercase with underscores\nbetween them are constant values.\n\n110\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.400\nThat means if you're in languages that\ncan keep it from being over-written,\n\n111\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.300\nyou would, but\nin Python the best you can do is a tuple.\n\n112\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.510\nThat doesn't mean I can't\nreassign that variable,\n\n113\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.400\nbut I can't change like\ncheese to chocolate.\n\n114\n00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.500\nSo I can't make those changes internal,\nand\n\n115\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.140\nthat's by using a tuple instead of list.\n\n116\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.290\nThey're immutable.\n\n117\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.660\nThat means they cannot be changed.\n\n118\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.210\nThey cannot be mutated.\n\n119\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.030\n&gt;&gt; And that's just by the capitalization?\n\n120\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.030\nIt's because of where it is in the code,\nand you're just kind of making it like\n\n121\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.650\na visual of a more visual representation\nof this is your constant,\n\n122\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.280\ntry not to change it, cuz it's like\nreally loud and it's not gonna change.\n\n123\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n124\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.210\nThe only reason that it has some\nimmutability is because of the tupple\n\n125\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.100\nwhich is indicative of the parantheses.\n\n126\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.190\nInstead of the square brackets that\nI can't change the internals of this,\n\n127\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.580\nI can technically reassign this to\nthe number six if I wanted to, but\n\n128\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.460\nI'm trying to convey hey this\nis a constant, don't do that.\n\n129\n00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay and the internals meaning like\nbetween the parentheses okay, all right.\n\n130\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.805\nYou know what I feel like I understand\nwhat you're talking about, thank you.\n\n131\n00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:40.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n132\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.590\nAll right, so, now,\n\n133\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.880\npart of the Python standard library,\nyou get all this stuff for free, right?\n\n134\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.250\nI could write my own random\nfunction that takes a list and\n\n135\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.370\ngives me a random thing out of it.\n\n136\n00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.650\nRandom.\n\n137\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.270\nHowever, I'm lazy as most programmers are.\n\n138\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.610\nAnd gonna say from random import choice.\n\n139\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.560\nNow what choice, does is it takes a\ncollection, a tuple, a list, or a string.\n\n140\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.370\nAnd it will randomly grab a piece\nof it and hand it back to you.\n\n141\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.630\nFor a strand it gives you a letter, for\na tup or a list it gives you and element.\n\n142\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.610\nSo it will give me either cheese,\napple, orange, or banana.\n\n143\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.260\nIt'll give me one of those, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.180\nNow what that means is,\nI have from random, and per choice.\n\n145\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.450\nAnd I have a word list that\nI'm going to chose from.\n\n146\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.960\nIt's kinda like a bag of words,\nI'm just gonna.\n\n147\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.240\nAnd then pull those out, and\nthen the game's going to start.\n\n148\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.610\n&gt;&gt; But you have to write that in the game.\n\n149\n00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.530\nCuz I was like, wait,\nthere needs to be more.\n\n150\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.910\nWait, you're just setting it up, and\n\n151\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.770\nthen telling it where to grab from in this\nlittle block that you have to adapt, okay.\n\n152\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.374\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and as a matter of fact,\nlet's do that right now.\n\n153\n00:07:52.374 --> 00:07:57.513\nLet's say selected_word = choice\n\n154\n00:07:57.513 --> 00:08:03.328\nFrom the word list just like that, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:03.328 --> 00:08:05.834\nSo let's just print out, whoa,\n\n156\n00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:11.751\nthat does not mean you get to yell\nthe selected_word, just like that, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:14.053\nSo now, if we come back over here,\nand notice,\n\n158\n00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:16.020\nI've just written a little bit of code.\n\n159\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.755\nAnd it's probably a little more\nthan I feel comfortable with, but\n\n160\n00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:23.557\nyou have to have all those pieces\nreally for this to make any sense and\n\n161\n00:08:23.557 --> 00:08:25.440\nI'm gonna run and it's banana.\n\n162\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.685\nI'm gonna Ctrl+C, get out of there,\nand I'm gonna re-run it again, and\n\n163\n00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:29.660\nnotice it's orange.\n\n164\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.141\nSo I'm just randomly reaching\ninto that word list bag and\n\n165\n00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:34.964\nha, there's a random word.\n\n166\n00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:38.511\nAnd yeah, could you look at the source\ncode and figure this out and say,\n\n167\n00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:40.125\nI know it's one of these words.\n\n168\n00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:44.547\nYou could, but long term, you might\nbe able to find a word list from,\n\n169\n00:08:44.547 --> 00:08:49.610\nthat's a gigabyte in size, it's a text\nfile that you just read in at runtime.\n\n170\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.506\nAnd then there's no way that someone\nis gonna go, well I don't know.\n\n171\n00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:58.852\nSo we have that, and well,\nwe have our random word.\n\n172\n00:08:58.852 --> 00:09:04.775\nSo if we looked at our kind of our task,\nwe have selected a random word.\n\n173\n00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:07.980\nNow here's what I'm going to do.\n\n174\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:14.774\nI'm gonna keep this, but let's think\nabout this, I've got to think here.\n\n175\n00:09:14.774 --> 00:09:17.991\nI have a selected word, I'm gonna take\nout this print because that would kind of\n\n176\n00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:19.299\ndefeat the purpose of the game.\n\n177\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.394\nBecause orange, I bet it starts with an O.\n\n178\n00:09:23.394 --> 00:09:24.610\nSo I have an output,\n\n179\n00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.484\nwhich is just collecting all\nthe guesses that the user has made.\n\n180\n00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:31.893\nAnd then I've selected a word\nthat I should be guessing and\n\n181\n00:09:31.893 --> 00:09:35.249\nthen immediately I go into the game,\nlike things start.\n\n182\n00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:38.333\nAnd then I say, please enter\na letter you wish to guess, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:43.041\nAnd then when they guess,\nI just accumulate that, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:47.343\nAnd then well,\nif I've maintained guesses effectively or\n\n185\n00:09:47.343 --> 00:09:51.989\nhave typed in ten letters,\nnot necessarily individual guess,\n\n186\n00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:55.445\ncuz someone could type\nin more than one letter.\n\n187\n00:09:55.445 --> 00:10:00.312\nBut now how do I determine if a,\nb, c, d, or\n\n188\n00:10:00.312 --> 00:10:06.121\nwhatever, are inside of\nthe actual selected word.\n\n189\n00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:08.307\nSo let's do this, so\nwe're gonna come out to here and\n\n190\n00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:09.972\nwe're gonna add another if statement.\n\n191\n00:10:09.972 --> 00:10:15.289\nAnd if, let's see here,\n\n192\n00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:21.585\nif letter in selected_word,\n\n193\n00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:29.916\nThen print, let's do this, letter or\n\n194\n00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:33.810\nsomething in the word, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.015\nSo I'm gonna format and\nI'm just gonna put a letter there.\n\n196\n00:10:36.015 --> 00:10:39.793\nSo what that'll do is that'll replace\nthat curly brace with the actual letter\n\n197\n00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:43.530\nvalue and it'll just tell you if you got\nit right that hey, it's in the word.\n\n198\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.830\nNow we're not finished, this is\ntechnically determining whether our\n\n199\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.630\nguesses are correct, but there's probably\na little more that we should do here.\n\n200\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:58.189\nSo I'm gonna kick this off and we're\ngonna see, hey, do we win or do we lose?\n\n201\n00:10:58.189 --> 00:11:00.213\nSo I'm gonna try o, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:00.213 --> 00:11:02.672\nHow about b?\n\n203\n00:11:02.672 --> 00:11:05.913\nHow about e?\n\n204\n00:11:05.913 --> 00:11:11.440\ne, [LAUGH] e, let's put an is in there.\n\n205\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.730\nWell, e in word is in the word.\n\n206\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.559\nSo e is in there, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.250\nAnd that was a little bit of\ngrammar shenanigans on that part.\n\n208\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm trying to remember our words.\n\n209\n00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.240\nWe had banana, orange, apple, and cheese.\n\n210\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.522\nOkay, so it could be orange.\n\n211\n00:11:26.522 --> 00:11:29.118\n&gt;&gt; Except I tried o and o's not in there.\n\n212\n00:11:29.118 --> 00:11:30.523\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it can't be o.\n\n213\n00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.582\nOkay, we'll it's not banana.\n\n214\n00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:36.910\nOkay, so we know it's either cheese or-\n&gt;&gt; It's not cheese.\n\n215\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.506\n&gt;&gt; Wait, no?\n\n216\n00:11:37.506 --> 00:11:39.590\n&gt;&gt; It is apple, because a is there.\n\n217\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH] I'm bad at this game.\n\n218\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There is a wonderful strategy\n\n219\n00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:47.793\nif you're using english, rstlme.\n\n220\n00:11:47.793 --> 00:11:51.585\nThose are actually very common constants\nand one of the most common vowels.\n\n221\n00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:54.500\nSo you always guess this first,\ncuz of the high probability.\n\n222\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.220\nSorry, I just kind of gamed the game, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.773\n&gt;&gt; We know that it's apple, so\n\n224\n00:11:58.773 --> 00:12:00.205\nwe are able to catch that.\n\n225\n00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:04.121\nOkay, all right, all right,\nwe're good, we're good.\n\n226\n00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:08.138\nSo we still have this\nkind of printing out, and\n\n227\n00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:15.250\nI think we have the ability to determine\nwhether our guest was in the word, right?\n\n228\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.678\nSo we come back over here, and\nwe say, if letter in selected word,\n\n229\n00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:20.161\nthen just do this print out.\n\n230\n00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:24.639\nSo our logic kind of already exists,\n\n231\n00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:28.976\nwe're not quite finished though.\n\n232\n00:12:28.976 --> 00:12:32.195\nHere's what I'm thinking,\nhere's what I'm thinking.\n\n233\n00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:33.043\nYou ready?\n\n234\n00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:37.821\nHow about let's say at\nthe beginning of every one,\n\n235\n00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:41.943\nwe just clear the actual terminal, right?\n\n236\n00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:43.213\nWe just clear it out.\n\n237\n00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.962\nLet's do our snazzification,\nlet's take a quick detour.\n\n238\n00:12:45.962 --> 00:12:51.282\nSo here's our snazify, because in\nall honesty, we're gonna further\n\n239\n00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:56.970\nexpand on this, Python makes it so\neasy to go, yeah, it's kinda there.\n\n240\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.170\nOur logic's finished, there's some\nmore things that we need to do.\n\n241\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.266\nBut let's clear out the terminal window,\n\n242\n00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:09.310\nbefore taking another guess, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.478\nAnd we're gonna run into some issues and\n\n244\n00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:14.550\nI'll show you how to fix those\nwhen we actually get here.\n\n245\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.680\nBut in order to do this we\nhave to call a utility.\n\n246\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.070\nIf you come back over here, and\nyou remember, I'm gonna clear out of this.\n\n247\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.264\nI'm gonna type clear, right?\n\n248\n00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:29.550\nIf I could some way get Python to call\nclear for me that's what would happen.\n\n249\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.411\nSo clear, and we're all good.\n\n250\n00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:36.259\nThis is gonna be a little more\ncomplicated than just something simple.\n\n251\n00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:40.644\nBecause on Windows machines,\nit's not clear, it's CLS.\n\n252\n00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:44.353\nSo I need to determine, am I on windows or\nI am on something else?\n\n253\n00:13:44.353 --> 00:13:47.320\nIn order to determine what\ncommand I need to clear.\n\n254\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.772\nSo what I am gonna do,\nis I'm gonna come back here and\n\n255\n00:13:50.772 --> 00:13:54.542\nI am gonna reach out on\nthe standard library, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:54.542 --> 00:14:00.203\nSo I'm gonna import subprocess,\nAnd what a process does is,\n\n257\n00:14:00.203 --> 00:14:05.570\nis it allows me to call other programs\nthat are installed on my system.\n\n258\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.010\nThere are some caveats, and\nyou've gotta be careful kinda things.\n\n259\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.127\nBut the subprocess module says, okay,\n\n260\n00:14:14.127 --> 00:14:19.061\nI'll call some kind of downloader,\nor I'll call clear screen, or\n\n261\n00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:24.533\nI can call mkdir, or I can call touch,\nany of those that are on your system.\n\n262\n00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:30.102\nSo what we're gonna do is\nsubprocess has a function,\n\n263\n00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:34.074\nwow, if I can spell it, called call.\n\n264\n00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:37.540\nHey, subprocess call\nthe following function.\n\n265\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.704\nAnd what we're gonna do is say cls\n\n266\n00:14:42.704 --> 00:14:47.872\nif we wanna know if it is Windows.\n\n267\n00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:52.643\nI don't have any way to determine\nif I'm on a Windows machine or\n\n268\n00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:54.811\nif I'm on a something else.\n\n269\n00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:58.843\nSo we're gonna reach back up into\nthe standard library, and yes, people,\n\n270\n00:14:58.843 --> 00:15:00.678\nI'm lazy, I'm not going to lie.\n\n271\n00:15:00.678 --> 00:15:03.948\nAnd we're gonna bring in\nthe platform module, what\n\n272\n00:15:03.948 --> 00:15:08.946\nthe platform does is allow me to query\nthings based on the computer that I'm on.\n\n273\n00:15:08.946 --> 00:15:11.400\nSo what platform am I on?\n\n274\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.896\nI'm gonna say platform.system = Windows,\n\n275\n00:15:18.896 --> 00:15:24.256\nso call cls if the platform is on Windows,\n\n276\n00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:27.333\notherwise call clear.\n\n277\n00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:32.382\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and in the platform\nlibrary that you're calling in,\n\n278\n00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:34.960\nlike it understands Windows.\n\n279\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.220\nIt's not like, PC?\n\n280\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.152\nThe word Windows is like the key word of\nwhat it's, okay, yep, you're on Windows,\n\n281\n00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.510\nit's not PC or-\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n282\n00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.570\n&gt;&gt; Windows 10 or what have you.\n\n283\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.606\n&gt;&gt; And part of that is, I go lurking\naround in the documentation and\n\n284\n00:15:50.606 --> 00:15:51.815\nthings like that.\n\n285\n00:15:51.815 --> 00:15:55.000\nBut right now, I'm just telling you,\nbecause we wanna get things done.\n\n286\n00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you know this, but this is\nsomething that you would need to look into\n\n287\n00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.713\nthat particular library,\nto know what to type in.\n\n288\n00:16:01.713 --> 00:16:03.594\nFor that operating system.\n\n289\n00:16:03.594 --> 00:16:04.955\n&gt;&gt; But it does bring up a good point.\n\n290\n00:16:04.955 --> 00:16:06.930\nWhat if I don't have the Internet?\n\n291\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.780\nI know it's the platform, but\nI don't know those options, right?\n\n292\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.150\nI know platform.system will give me\nsomething that I can make decisions on.\n\n293\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.823\nSo what I do is I hop into Python 3,\nthe repl, and\n\n294\n00:16:16.823 --> 00:16:20.900\nI'm gonna import platorm.\n\n295\n00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.000\nAnd the whole purpose of this\nenvironment is to play around.\n\n296\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.710\nSo I'm gonna say platform.system,\nand mine says Darwin.\n\n297\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.550\nThe reason that mine says Darwin\nis underlying MacOS is based on\n\n298\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.290\nthe Darwin kernel I think,\nwhich is based on Unix.\n\n299\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.760\nSo that's why I say else.\n\n300\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:47.060\nWhen you do this on a Windows platform,\nit says capital W, Windows.\n\n301\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.350\nAnd you can go look in the dots,\nyou can do that.\n\n302\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.374\nBut you can at least get an idea of,\n\n303\n00:16:53.374 --> 00:16:58.798\nif you really wanna read more into it,\nyou can say platform.system.\n\n304\n00:16:58.798 --> 00:17:05.980\nNotice I put help(platform.system),\nand there you go.\n\n305\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.697\n&gt;&gt; So it's the internal\nhelp files of the library.\n\n306\n00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:11.590\nIs that what you keep calling it?\n\n307\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:12.880\n&gt;&gt; It's a library or it's a module.\n\n308\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.090\nIt's part of the standard library.\n\n309\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Standard library,\nthat's what you were using.\n\n310\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.330\nOkay, and the module within that library\nthat it will tell you what it is.\n\n311\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.990\nAnd that's what we're looking for\nthe Linux, Windows, Java.\n\n312\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.320\nBut it doesn't say anything about Darwin.\n\n313\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so eg,\nit gives you a finite list.\n\n314\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.870\nSo on your particular platform,\nyou would check it out.\n\n315\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.610\nBut notice more than likely\non a Linux platform,\n\n316\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.540\nit's gonna tell you\nLinux with a capital L.\n\n317\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.444\nOn a Windows platform it's\ngonna tell you Windows, Java.\n\n318\n00:17:39.444 --> 00:17:41.518\nI don't know when that would happen, but\n\n319\n00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:45.500\nthere may be a time when you're in a\nparticular run time, then it returns Java.\n\n320\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.980\nSo, those are helpful if you don't know.\n\n321\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.760\nSo thanks for bringing those up,\nand from there, I hit Ctrl+D.\n\n322\n00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.180\nJust as a reminder, Ctrl+D, and\ntrust me, I completely understand.\n\n323\n00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.657\nWhy is it not Ctrl+C like other times?\n\n324\n00:18:01.657 --> 00:18:05.263\nCtrl+C is keyboard interrupt for\nthe current process, but\n\n325\n00:18:05.263 --> 00:18:07.181\nthis is a more persistent loop.\n\n326\n00:18:07.181 --> 00:18:11.630\nSo when in doubt, Ctrl+C doesn't work,\ntry Ctrl+D, which is typically an exit.\n\n327\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.460\nIt's a harder exit than Ctrl+C.\n\n328\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.930\n&gt;&gt; Was that because we\nwere in the help file and\n\n329\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.550\nwe were kind of pullng from stuff,\nor it just is?\n\n330\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.410\n&gt;&gt; No that's just the Python repl,\nand that's just how it works.\n\n331\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.563\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can take that.\n\n332\n00:18:23.563 --> 00:18:24.856\nIt's just Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D.\n\n333\n00:18:24.856 --> 00:18:29.210\n&gt;&gt; I'll allow it, I'll allow it, when in\ndoubt just run away with your hands up.\n\n334\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.250\nI'm joking, I'm joking.\n\n335\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.670\nSo subprocess.call cls if platform\nis windows, otherwise clear.\n\n336\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.290\nAnd what this will do is\nsome processors will go,\n\n337\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.990\nokay I know how to call clear, I gotcha.\n\n338\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.680\nSo this is a string that determines\nthe command that you want to be called.\n\n339\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.730\nLet's go check it out.\n\n340\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.320\nSo I'm gonna hop over here, and I'm just\ngonna type stuff, and just type stuff,\n\n341\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.200\nand type stuff.\n\n342\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.350\nAnd I'm doing that, I'm just raking\nmy hands across the keyboard,\n\n343\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.780\nbe careful doing that,\nbecause I want you to see.\n\n344\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.430\nAnd now I've cleared out, and\nnow I have removed all the distractions.\n\n345\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.840\nWe're gonna have a hiccup here, all right?\n\n346\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.846\nSo I'm gonna say a, and notice just for\na moment it said a isn't a word.\n\n347\n00:19:08.846 --> 00:19:12.310\np and it flashes, it's real fast.\n\n348\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.240\nAnd the reason being, this infinite\nloop is running, and running, and\n\n349\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.520\nrunning until it hits this input.\n\n350\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.904\nIt never stops anywhere else\nuntil it gets to break,\n\n351\n00:19:21.904 --> 00:19:24.217\nwhich will actually break out of it.\n\n352\n00:19:24.217 --> 00:19:26.645\nIf it gets here and prints,\nit comes to the top and\n\n353\n00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:28.610\nimmediately clears the screen again.\n\n354\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.197\nSo what we will do,\nthis is a little bit of a hack for now.\n\n355\n00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:36.345\nI'm just going to put input there and\nwhat that will do is that will stop until\n\n356\n00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:38.819\nthe next keyboard entry,\njust so we can see, all right?.\n\n357\n00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:42.370\nI'm going to Ctrl+C and\npython, clear the screen.\n\n358\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:49.813\nA little snazzification there, a, b,\nokay, it's not banana, it's not apple.\n\n359\n00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:53.769\nMaybe it's orange, hm,\nwhat was our other one, e?\n\n360\n00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:56.310\ne is in the word,\nnotice my cursor stopped.\n\n361\n00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.430\nAnd it's just hanging out until I hit\nEnter again and now it's ready for\n\n362\n00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.150\nthe next guess.\n\n363\n00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.587\n&gt;&gt; Okay, at first I was like,\nwait it's broken.\n\n364\n00:20:02.587 --> 00:20:08.342\nWait, it's what you have to choose,\nthe right letter for it to print.\n\n365\n00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:09.910\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And those were wrong letters.\n\n366\n00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.380\nSo [LAUGH] that's why it didn't,\nand so it worked.\n\n367\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.050\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, it works, right?\n\n368\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.471\nSo we've done our little snazification and\nnow there's one final thing.\n\n369\n00:20:18.471 --> 00:20:22.000\nAnd you're like well Justin,\nseems like that might be complicated.\n\n370\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.890\nAnd it actually, we're gonna come back,\n\n371\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.210\nif we look at our readme, to determine if\nthe user's guessed letter is in the word.\n\n372\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.130\nI actually wanna keep track of that, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:36.140\nI wanna keep track of did you guess and\nit's in the word, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.760\nSo let's see here, I've selected a word.\n\n375\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.100\nI really want to also\ncreate a number of blanks.\n\n376\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.297\nA list that it has the same\nnumber of letters as the word but\n\n377\n00:20:53.297 --> 00:20:55.966\nthey're essentially blanks, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:55.966 --> 00:21:01.210\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say,\nhow about blanks?\n\n379\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.820\nLet's go-\n&gt;&gt; That's the spaces that the letters,\n\n380\n00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.980\nwhen we were talking about drawing\nthe little underlines for,\n\n381\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.080\nthis is how many letters are in the word?\n\n382\n00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.340\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're doing.\n\n383\n00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.650\nWe're essentially building the data\nstructure that will allow us to do that.\n\n384\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:24.654\nBut for now, all I want is I want\na list that has Nones in them.\n\n385\n00:21:24.654 --> 00:21:29.460\nBlank is like None, right,\ntimes the len of the selected word.\n\n386\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:36.340\nSo I'm gonna get a None for every one of\nthe letters from the random word, okay?\n\n387\n00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.390\nSo just to show this,\nI'm actually gonna come right here and\n\n388\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:46.090\nadd a print(selected_word) and\nprint(letters).\n\n389\n00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.720\nYou know what, I actually need to do\n\n390\n00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.510\nthat right here, because otherwise\nthings are gonna get a little weird.\n\n391\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.620\nIt would clear out the screen.\n\n392\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.257\nSo I'm gonna say letters.\n\n393\n00:22:01.213 --> 00:22:07.510\nLet's make this of_selected_word,\nprobably end up changing that name.\n\n394\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.610\nIt's a very long name.\n\n395\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.250\nSo let's go back over here,\nlet's clear this out.\n\n396\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.814\nOkay, python3, main, and\n\n397\n00:22:15.814 --> 00:22:20.550\nnotice I have Apple, A-P-P-L-E.\n\n398\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.630\nAnd I have a None, None, None, None, None.\n\n399\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:28.160\nOkay, when I guess a,\nit says a is in the word.\n\n400\n00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.310\nI'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n401\n00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:34.096\nWhat I want is everywhere there's an A,\nI want that None to be replaced.\n\n402\n00:22:34.096 --> 00:22:37.580\nThis is essentially me\ngetting something right.\n\n403\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.190\nAll right, otherwise,\nI'm gonna be getting it wrong.\n\n404\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.350\nSo how does one do that?\n\n405\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.560\nOkay, this is gonna be a little more\ncomplicated than I would like to, but\n\n406\n00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.950\nwe'll clean this up at a later time.\n\n407\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.330\nI'm gonna leave this here for now.\n\n408\n00:22:55.330 --> 00:23:00.020\nIf the letter's in the selected word,\nhere's what I want to do, okay?\n\n409\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.970\nI want to run through the selected\nword for each letter, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.410\nSo just like that,\nI'm gonna take this out.\n\n411\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:15.380\nAnd I'm gonna say, for char in.\n\n412\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.910\nSo for each character in\nthe selected word, then if\n\n413\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:25.275\nchar == the letter that I guessed.\n\n414\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.230\nSo I guessed a letter and if the letter's\nin the selected word, I wanna run through.\n\n415\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.330\nWhy am I making a loop?\n\n416\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.370\nBecause, Vonne,\nit looks like you got something.\n\n417\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.912\n&gt;&gt; Just really quick, the character, the\nchar, that's a thing within the program.\n\n418\n00:23:41.912 --> 00:23:46.220\nWe didn't set that as a variable,\nor did we?\n\n419\n00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.170\n&gt;&gt; So right here, for char n, this will\ncreate a temporary variable called char.\n\n420\n00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.083\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And it will say,\n\n421\n00:23:51.083 --> 00:23:53.477\nwell the first time through,\nlet's say it was apple.\n\n422\n00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:58.139\nChar would be a, and then it would be p,\nand then it would be p again, and l, and\n\n423\n00:23:58.139 --> 00:23:58.657\nthen e.\n\n424\n00:23:58.657 --> 00:24:00.350\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n425\n00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.938\nthat's like an internal variable or-\n&gt;&gt; It's a temporary loop variable.\n\n426\n00:24:04.938 --> 00:24:05.930\n&gt;&gt; Temp, okay.\n\n427\n00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.992\n&gt;&gt; So, if char is the letter,\nthen what do I wanna do?\n\n428\n00:24:09.992 --> 00:24:16.820\nWell, I actually need to replace that\nnone in the corresponding position.\n\n429\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.790\nIf I come back over here and I run.\n\n430\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.120\nLet's say I say b.\n\n431\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.160\nThat I'm gonna replace this none with a b.\n\n432\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.399\nWell if I guess a I actually have a,\na and a.\n\n433\n00:24:26.399 --> 00:24:27.540\nI need a three places.\n\n434\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.330\nWell I need to keep track of the position,\n\n435\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.850\nand there's a few\ndifferent ways to do that.\n\n436\n00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.140\nBut I want to do that Pythonically.\n\n437\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.930\nSo I'm gonna say the index of the char,\nin selected_word.\n\n438\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.660\nAnd I want you to enumerate.\n\n439\n00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.504\nAll right, enumerate.\n\n440\n00:24:43.504 --> 00:24:48.280\nWhat enumerate's gonna do, is it's gonna\ngive me the position and the character for\n\n441\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:48.887\na string.\n\n442\n00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:53.020\nSo I'm gonna get 0b, 1a.\n\n443\n00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.626\nAnd if I do this and\nif that char is the letter,\n\n444\n00:24:57.626 --> 00:25:04.930\nthen I'm gonna say\nletters_of_selected_word[index] = char.\n\n445\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.510\nThere's some, whew,\nnosebleed logic there, it's all right.\n\n446\n00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.960\nWe're always gonna come back here, so\nwe're gonna get to see this in action.\n\n447\n00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.960\nBut effectively, we're keeping\ntrack of correct guesses, and\n\n448\n00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.505\nwe're updating the letters\nof the selected word.\n\n449\n00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:23.355\nHere we go, are you ready Yvonne?\n\n450\n00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n&gt;&gt; This might make a little more\n\n451\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.460\nsense when we actually run this.\n\n452\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.340\nSo we know that it's Apple, and I'm gonna\nguess a wrong letter to make sure that it\n\n453\n00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.850\ndoesn't, I didn't change anything.\n\n454\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.650\nBut what if I say a?\n\n455\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.480\nNotice it puts an a in there, in its spot.\n\n456\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.548\nI was thinking of this like the blanks\nare like a list of nothings, and\n\n457\n00:25:43.548 --> 00:25:47.545\nthen when you get them right,\nI replace that nothing with the letter,\n\n458\n00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:49.470\nif you refer back to our drawing.\n\n459\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.687\nWhat if I do a p?\n\n460\n00:25:51.687 --> 00:25:53.649\nIt replaces both of them.\n\n461\n00:25:53.649 --> 00:25:59.130\nAnd the reason it replaces both of them,\nis because of this iteration here.\n\n462\n00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:04.570\nSo I make sure to run through the entire\nselected word to see, hey, you guessed p.\n\n463\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.690\nSo I'm gonna keep track of\nevery p that's in there.\n\n464\n00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.130\n&gt;&gt; And that's with the index and\nthe enumerate?\n\n465\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.031\nIs that what's kicking\nthe internal loop I'll call it?\n\n466\n00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:20.024\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so for index char and\nenumerate, I'm gonna get the position,\n\n467\n00:26:20.024 --> 00:26:23.410\nwhich I need to update\nthis associated array.\n\n468\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:29.470\nAnd then the Char is each character\nin this case, when it runs through\n\n469\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.560\nit will say A, P, P, L, E that's what\nchar will be through each of the loop.\n\n470\n00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.450\nIf the letter that we have guessed\nis equal to whatever the current\n\n471\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.480\ncharacter is that we're testing.\n\n472\n00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.540\nThen I'm gonna say, okay, well update\nfrom a none which is right here,\n\n473\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.410\nto whatever the character\nthat you guessed.\n\n474\n00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.880\nAnd by looping through every character,\nI also get duplicates.\n\n475\n00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.562\nIf you try this without a loop,\nyou'll only get one.\n\n476\n00:26:55.562 --> 00:26:58.430\nSo you would only get\nto see one of the p's.\n\n477\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.680\nBecause they'll say, well there's the\nfirst p, and you update that single one.\n\n478\n00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.820\n&gt;&gt; And\njust to make sure I've got the basics.\n\n479\n00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.700\nThat word index and char,\nI mean we could have made up\n\n480\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.170\nfan and light,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n481\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.820\nBut, I mean you made those words up,\nthose were not\n\n482\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.710\nspecific Python functions, or\ncommands, or anything like that.\n\n483\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're absolutely correct.\n\n484\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.660\nI made those up because they\nhave semantic meaning to me, and\n\n485\n00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.790\nthey should have semantic meaning to you.\n\n486\n00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:31.220\nI could make these pickle and\ncheeseburger.\n\n487\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:40.110\nAnd just to show you, let's see,\ncheeseburger, and this is pickle.\n\n488\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.370\nand cheeseburger.\n\n489\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.851\nThere's nothing special\nabout the plain light text.\n\n490\n00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:52.758\nBut if I come back over here, and\nI kill it, and I run back through it, and\n\n491\n00:27:52.758 --> 00:27:55.828\nI say a, p,\nit still works exactly the same.\n\n492\n00:27:55.828 --> 00:27:58.684\nExcept now if you come down,\nyou come back a month later and you go,\n\n493\n00:27:58.684 --> 00:28:00.170\nwhat is pickle and cheeseburger?\n\n494\n00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I undo these, and\n\n495\n00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.430\nI pick things that have meaning to me.\n\n496\n00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.670\n&gt;&gt; And will also have meaning to other\npeople who are looking at my code.\n\n497\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.670\n&gt;&gt; That's the biggest thing\nwhen I'm looking at code.\n\n498\n00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.530\nIt's like, when you have letter equals,\nlike okay, I understand that you're\n\n499\n00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.190\ndetermining that particular\nvariable's value if you wanna say.\n\n500\n00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.160\nWhen it's internal within these things,\nthat's where it gets me confused.\n\n501\n00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:28.130\nLike wait, the language is that the user\nor the developer like making that up.\n\n502\n00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:32.360\nThat's the biggest thing that\ntrips me up on some of this stuff.\n\n503\n00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.140\n&gt;&gt; There are some hiccups here\nlike the subprocess.call.\n\n504\n00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.720\nThis is all white, so you're like I\ndidn't know that was built into Python.\n\n505\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.620\nBut if you're asking about keywords,\n\n506\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.250\nanything that is colored differently in\na rich text editor like this, are gonna\n\n507\n00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.560\nbe reserved keywords that you should not\nuse except in their particular context.\n\n508\n00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.190\nIf I did not import subprocess right here,\n\n509\n00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.250\nI could actually use the word\nsubprocess in a different context.\n\n510\n00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.000\nI could just say, blah, blah,\nblah, and it would work.\n\n511\n00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.790\nBut I'm making it up.\n\n512\n00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.250\nSo make sure you pick variable\nnames that are important to you.\n\n513\n00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.190\n&gt;&gt; And that's the other thing\nabout the rich text editor,\n\n514\n00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.060\nshowing the different colors.\n\n515\n00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.820\nI'm like, but that's white text.\n\n516\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.020\nBut it's up there.\n\n517\n00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.436\nThat is Python specific.\n\n518\n00:29:12.436 --> 00:29:16.952\nSo that's the part that gets\na little wavy for me in it.\n\n519\n00:29:16.952 --> 00:29:19.565\nAnd that's why I was kind of [SOUND] what?\n\n520\n00:29:19.565 --> 00:29:23.883\nBut when you explain it,\nI'm like yeah, it makes perfect sense.\n\n521\n00:29:23.883 --> 00:29:26.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know how you get permanence?\n\n522\n00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.160\nThrough practice,\npractice makes permanence.\n\n523\n00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.786\nSo, you have to practice this to\nsee those little nuance behaviors.\n\n524\n00:29:32.786 --> 00:29:38.136\nBut, you know Vonne, we set out to\ndetermine whether we got this right.\n\n525\n00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:41.180\nLike correct guesses?\n\n526\n00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.530\nI know it doesn't seem like it, but\n\n527\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.510\nwe've kind of been able to determine\nwhether we have correct guesses.\n\n528\n00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.030\nIs it reported or\nis it shown appropriately on the screen?\n\n529\n00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.230\nMaybe not, maybe it's not a full game yet,\n\n530\n00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:57.860\nbut if I type a,\nI can now see that I have all these a's.\n\n531\n00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.740\nWe need to snazzy this up, but I know for\na fact we don't have time in this episode,\n\n532\n00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.282\nso we're going to have to come back.\n\n533\n00:30:03.282 --> 00:30:06.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz I'm over here going,\nwe're having so much fun, but hey,\n\n534\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.510\nwe kind of need to wrap this one up,\nso we'll be coming back.\n\n535\n00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.070\nAre we coming back with a part two, or\n\n536\n00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.968\nare we going into another episode that\nwe're gonna be talking about this?\n\n537\n00:30:13.968 --> 00:30:15.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's gonna be some\nother things going on, so\n\n538\n00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.980\nI wouldn't call it a part two.\n\n539\n00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.040\nThese are all kind of continuations of\neach other, but just for your benefit and\n\n540\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.150\nmy benefit, we're trying to\nstay away from part ones, twos,\n\n541\n00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.930\nthrees, fours if possible.\n\n542\n00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.350\nAnd keep them more appropriately titled.\n\n543\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.530\nSo, it'll have a different title, but\nit will be a continuation of this project.\n\n544\n00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, just wanted to make sure.\n\n545\n00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.010\nAnd that's great.\n\n546\n00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.900\nAll right, wonderful.\n\n547\n00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.320\nWell yes, out of time,\nwe gotta wrap this one up.\n\n548\n00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.870\nSo, signing off for\nDevProTV I've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n549\n00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:41.590\nAnd I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n550\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.392\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n551\n00:30:42.392 --> 00:30:48.449\n[SOUND]\n\n",

DevPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:18.635\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:22.545\nwe are moving on in our applied\nfundamentals, hangman series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.115\nIn this episode,\nwe're going to be adding a presentation,\n\n6\n00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:27.867\nor presentation in my world.\n\n7\n00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.540\nThat means PowerPoint, but I'm pretty\nsure that's not the right channel.\n\n8\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.780\nWe're in DevPro, and\nI know we've been working the terminal.\n\n9\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.030\nAnd luckily, we have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.340\nJustin Dennison with us to help\nclarify exactly what is presentation.\n\n11\n00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.920\nHello, Justin, welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Vonne.\n\n12\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.010\nHow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n13\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.447\nI'm curious to know about\nwhat this presentation.\n\n14\n00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.720\nIt's all about what you\nassociate words with.\n\n15\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.260\nAnd, to me, I'm thinking like,\nI'm having a presentation right now.\n\n16\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.610\nI'm presenting this show to you.\n\n17\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.610\nWhich I don't know how we're\ngoing to correlate this into.\n\n18\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll take it over.\n\n19\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.460\nHopefully, we'll bring some.\n\n20\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.120\nI try to think of\na better descriptor word,\n\n21\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.160\nbut really all we're going to do is,\nhow is it presented?\n\n22\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.425\nIf you've ever watched a cooking show,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:15.376\nTo some extent, it is like PowerPoint, but\n\n24\n00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:18.150\nI think of it more of\na cooking show type thing.\n\n25\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020\nWell, it taste really nice,\nbut the presentation's off.\n\n26\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.650\nIt's sloppily done.\n\n27\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.850\nAnd really, that's where we are at\nthe point in our application.\n\n28\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.990\nIt works, but it's not nice to look at.\n\n29\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960\nNow one could argue,\nit's gonna be in a terminal, so\n\n30\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.870\nmaybe it's never nice to look at.\n\n31\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.785\nBut maybe we can work on its plating, and\n\n32\n00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.065\nnot necessarily get all kinds of crazy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n33\n00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:43.435\nthey do say in a presentation\nis everything, and\n\n34\n00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:47.085\nyes, it's all those cooking shows I\nlike to watch and the competitions.\n\n35\n00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:49.275\nYeah, it's all about,\nyour presentation is beautiful.\n\n36\n00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.205\nAnd so now, as soon as you said,\nit's like, okay.\n\n37\n00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:55.977\nSo we are talking about the terminal so\nthere's only so\n\n38\n00:01:55.977 --> 00:02:00.815\nmuch gussying up we can really do in\nthere but getting back to our game,\n\n39\n00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:03.538\nare we talking about maybe the blanks?\n\n40\n00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:05.190\nThe little underlines?\n\n41\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.910\nOr how it's being presented to\nthe user of how it's gonna be,\n\n42\n00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.620\nhow we're gonna look at the game?\n\n43\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.620\nIs that what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n44\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.790\nto some extent, it's a little bit of both.\n\n45\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.840\nAnd I think it's probably easiest to see\nwhere we are, and then talk about, and\n\n46\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.630\nmake a plan of what we're going\nto implement in this episode.\n\n47\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.860\nSo let's come down to the computer screen\nhere and well, I just have this open.\n\n48\n00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.200\nI'm gonna flip back over.\n\n49\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.670\nRight now I have this in full screen mode.\n\n50\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.920\nWe haven't done that up into this point.\n\n51\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.400\nBut I wanna make sure that we have\nas much real estate as possible.\n\n52\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.980\nI'm using multiple desktops.\n\n53\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.640\nSo if you're like what,\nhow did he do that?\n\n54\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.590\nWell, this is kind of a Mac specific.\n\n55\n00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860\nLinux also has multiple desktops.\n\n56\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.670\nWindows as of Windows 10 also has\nmultiple desktops that you can enable.\n\n57\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.290\nSo you can get similar things.\n\n58\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.890\nBut it is system specific.\n&gt;&gt; And we're getting a little more code.\n\n59\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.034\nSo we're writing more lines cuz\nnow what I'm thinking, ooh,\n\n60\n00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:56.794\nwe're going full screen, we're gonna be\nwriting some long big blocks of code.\n\n61\n00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:00.795\nBut I know you're gonna help explain it so\nI'm feeling good so far.\n\n62\n00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:03.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, fingers crossed.\n\n63\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.730\nWe're gonna give it a try.\n\n64\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.679\nSo let's see where we are and\nremember Python 3, that's where we are,\n\n65\n00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:09.862\npython3main.py.\n\n66\n00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:14.181\nAnd notice I right now have this printed\nout, and this is our presentation.\n\n67\n00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:18.101\nNumber one, we should not be\ntelling the user what the word is.\n\n68\n00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.990\nThat's important, so we'll remove that.\n\n69\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.330\nBut also right now it's just, well if you\nscroll up like that, that's what it does.\n\n70\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.438\nBut right here, None,\nNone, None, None, None.\n\n71\n00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:30.664\nThat means it's how many blanks I have.\n\n72\n00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:35.048\nThat's probably not a great way\nto give that to the user, right?\n\n73\n00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:39.732\nWhen we drew our hangman in the very\nfirst episode, it was blank,\n\n74\n00:03:39.732 --> 00:03:41.840\nblank, blank, blank.\n\n75\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.100\nThey need to know how many\nletters there are to guess.\n\n76\n00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.890\nShouldn't see none, right?\n\n77\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.100\nSo that's important.\n\n78\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.140\nBut if I type a and hit Enter,\nnotice it gets replaced.\n\n79\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.548\nNow, because of the terminal, and\nnot to make this too complicated,\n\n80\n00:03:58.548 --> 00:04:02.335\nwe are gonna have to sacrifice\nsome of this a little bit, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:03.550\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n82\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.650\nSo there's p.\n\n83\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.590\nThere's l, and there's e,\nand everything looks good.\n\n84\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.150\nAnd right now I can just\ncontinue guessing, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.065\nSo that guesses and there's still some\nother things that are going on there\n\n86\n00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:19.837\nthat we're actually gonna remove.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\n\n87\n00:04:19.837 --> 00:04:21.900\nI just had the cuz we set it to ten,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.826\nCuz you just hit ten letters.\n\n89\n00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:25.770\nSo I got a little confused, and like wait,\n\n90\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.064\nI don't remember us saying congratulations\nwhen the word was guessed,\n\n91\n00:04:29.064 --> 00:04:31.500\ntotally separate thing though.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally separate thing,\n\n92\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.950\nand to some extent,\nthat is a presentation matter, right?\n\n93\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.670\nWe're gonna remove some code,\nwe're gonna add a little bit of code,\n\n94\n00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.690\nand hopefully make how the user\ninteracts with it a little nicer,\n\n95\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.670\na little more intuitive, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.800\nSo that's where we are now.\n\n97\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.500\nAnd that's not what we want.\n\n98\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.960\nSo let's go ahead and make a plan.\n\n99\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.380\nAnd what is today, Vonne?\n\n100\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.794\nI think it's the 7th, right?\n&gt;&gt; It is the 7th.\n\n101\n00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:55.430\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; So we are going to accomplish.\n\n102\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.020\nWe are going in.\n\n103\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.040\nLet's get some overscroll here.\n\n104\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.903\nAnd we are going to\naccomplish the following.\n\n105\n00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:05.844\nTo accomplish the following and first,\n\n106\n00:05:05.844 --> 00:05:10.920\nactually make the win condition.\n\n107\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.265\nWin, let me put that in quote because\nwe're always going to be able to win\n\n108\n00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:16.800\neffectively.\n\n109\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.224\nMake the win condition based\non the number of Nones, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:27.640\nSo the number of Nones that\nare still on that list as we guess.\n\n111\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.290\nAnd then and remove extraneous prints,\n\n112\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.034\nextraneous print statements, and\n\n113\n00:05:41.034 --> 00:05:49.276\ndisplay blanks if the letter\nhas not been guessed.\n\n114\n00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:56.430\nAnd finally, display the letter,\nIf the letter has been guessed.\n\n115\n00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:03.324\nAnd if you're like, man, I always get a.\n\n116\n00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:06.618\nIf at any point, Vonne, if I'm talking\nreally fast and I start switching around,\n\n117\n00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:09.270\nI'm gonna need you to say, hey Justin,\nI need you to slow it down.\n\n118\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.360\nYou're doing all kinds of crazy stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.520\nI don't think that's the case here but\nit just made me think of that so\n\n120\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.370\nkeep that in mind.\n\n121\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.730\nBut we're gonna come over here,\nand let's actually go through it.\n\n122\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.310\nLet's remove these extraneous prints.\n\n123\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.790\nThose are gone.\n\n124\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.620\nAnd before we do anything else, this\nis actually our break condition, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.170\nYou won with the output.\n\n126\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.230\nWe don't wanna keep\ntrack of output anymore.\n\n127\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.010\nWe want to actually not print the output,\n\n128\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.950\nbut let's take this and remove that.\n\n129\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.540\nAnd let's actually remove that.\n\n130\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.300\nAnd the reason I'm doing that is I don't\nneed to collect every letter that I'm\n\n131\n00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.510\nnow typing.\n\n132\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.927\nJust to review the process,\nI clear the screen, I take input.\n\n133\n00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:56.600\nWhere does that input?\n\n134\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.664\nIf the letter is in the selected word,\nif the letter is in that word, then for\n\n135\n00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:06.651\nevery character in the selected word,\nif the character matches the letter\n\n136\n00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.267\nthat I guessed then change\nthe letters_of_selected_word list.\n\n137\n00:07:11.267 --> 00:07:14.730\nInstead of a none,\nput the letter in its place, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.490\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n139\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.680\nIf we got rid of input,\nwe can no longer use this condition.\n\n140\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:29.640\nSo what I'm going to do is\nsay if None is not in, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.150\nAnd actually, let's say if, wait for it.\n\n142\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.880\nletters, if None,\nI don't wanna say is not.\n\n143\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.091\nIf not, None in, there we go.\n\n144\n00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:52.273\nletters_of_selected_word.\n\n145\n00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:55.964\nSo effectively I'm changing this\nevery time I guess a letter.\n\n146\n00:07:55.964 --> 00:08:00.364\nAnd if I scroll up, this part is\nreplacing the None with the letter.\n\n147\n00:08:00.364 --> 00:08:04.857\nAnd as soon as I have no nones left,\nas soon as I've guessed all the letters,\n\n148\n00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:07.120\nthen this will go, you've won.\n\n149\n00:08:08.894 --> 00:08:14.400\nAnd now I'm just gonna grab this\nprint statement, cut it and\n\n150\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.595\nsay print, but I can't use output\nanymore cuz output doesn't work.\n\n151\n00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:23.240\nI'm gonna move this comment,\nI'll put doesn't exist anymore.\n\n152\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.440\nIt is more about,\nwhat word did you guessed?\n\n153\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.340\nThe selected word.\n\n154\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.420\nSo let's just say, you guessed the word.\n\n155\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.790\nSo that gets a little weird like, wait a\nminute, you just deleted a bunch of code.\n\n156\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.002\nWhy would you do that?\n\n157\n00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:43.450\nWell, there's two ways\nto make a program work.\n\n158\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.930\nWrite more code or delete code.\n\n159\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.340\nSo we deleted things then\na little bit of re arranging and\n\n160\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.790\nnow this is a little simpler than it was.\n\n161\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.164\nWe had to be careful because there\nwas fair amount of thought processes\n\n162\n00:08:56.164 --> 00:08:59.899\ninvolved with making the decisions of\nwhere to move things, how to do those.\n\n163\n00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:03.545\nSo just be careful there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, how you simplify is like\n\n164\n00:09:03.545 --> 00:09:07.130\nyou either win or you lose,\n[LAUGH] you either type or you delete.\n\n165\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.350\nBut my question and maybe I just need\nto hear you explain a little bit more,\n\n166\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.750\nbut to me it's like In logical talk\nif I'm like, just keep guessing.\n\n167\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.450\nAnd then you go, it's weird the order\nthat you put the congratulations\n\n168\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.320\nyou've won before the guessing.\n\n169\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.040\nDoes that make any sense?\n\n170\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.200\nI don't know if I'm saying it clearly.\n\n171\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.080\nBut it just seems to me, in my head,\n\n172\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.860\nit seems out of order.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n173\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.650\nyou're absolutely correct,\nin the case of how does the game play out?\n\n174\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.390\nYou keep in mind,\nwe may have to rearrange this.\n\n175\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.910\nBut what I did is I\nkept that if statement,\n\n176\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.060\nwhich is our original termination\ncondition, and kinda consolidated things.\n\n177\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.830\nThat does not mean that\nit's in the correct\n\n178\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.990\nplace.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n179\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.040\ndo you mind if I try to explain this back?\n\n180\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.790\nCuz if not none, so if not none,\nso all the letters are selected.\n\n181\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.880\nThen go ahead and print it out.\n\n182\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.460\nBut if it hasn't done that, it's kinda\nlike the break is like the else,\n\n183\n00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.450\ngo ahead and\njust do this whole character replacing.\n\n184\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.930\nSo does that make sense now?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're absolutely correct.\n\n185\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.250\nBecause what is gonna happen is\nyou're gonna guess a letter and\n\n186\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.110\nthen it's gonna check to see if you've won\n\n187\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.952\nat this current time.\n&gt;&gt; First, that's the first thing it\n\n188\n00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:26.380\nchecks and if it hasn't met that, then\nmove down onto the next block of code.\n\n189\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.580\n&gt;&gt; And I agree with you.\n\n190\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.923\nThis is out of order as far as logic,\n\n191\n00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:34.235\nbecause really what should happen\nis I should grab this, cut it.\n\n192\n00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:38.360\nSo that's Cmd+X or\nCtrl+X on other systems.\n\n193\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.037\nAnd now I'm just gonna\nremove that to the bottom,\n\n194\n00:10:41.037 --> 00:10:43.950\nbecause I think this is\na more intuitive flow.\n\n195\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.050\nI guessed a letter,\nif the letter's in the word then check it.\n\n196\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.700\nAnd now if you have\nguessed all the letters,\n\n197\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.560\nthe game ends and you'll have won.\n\n198\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.960\nThe wincheck is at the very end.\n\n199\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.490\nDoes that make a little\nmore sense in this context?\n\n200\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it doesn't matter which,\n\n201\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.750\neither way would work or no?\n&gt;&gt; Work is such a relative term.\n\n202\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.510\nWhat may happen is you may go,\nwell I've already won, but\n\n203\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.490\nI have to guess another letter before\nthe game quit, so it does matter.\n\n204\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.750\nThe flow of logic does matter.\n\n205\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.380\nWhat happened there in kind of the\nreorganization part to trim down things.\n\n206\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.684\nOrder, you have to reevaluate\ndoes your logic still fall within\n\n207\n00:11:27.684 --> 00:11:29.540\nthe appropriate order.\n\n208\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.028\nVonne's like, hold up,\nJustin, you're lying,\n\n209\n00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:33.290\nthat's not right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.040\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely correct,\n\n211\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.940\nthe part of that is removing things.\n\n212\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:42.260\nSo at this point I deleted,\nI have moved, I haven't actually added\n\n213\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.600\nany additional code other than this little\nbit right here that was replacement.\n\n214\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.930\nAnd yes, I changed this to get rid\nof output to use selected word.\n\n215\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:57.100\nLet's see how that behaves in\nterminal as far as our game.\n\n216\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.020\nAnd I would argue that this\nis part of presentation.\n\n217\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.854\nHow things are presented is\nalso part of presentation.\n\n218\n00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:10.650\nSo main.py, enter a letter, A-B-A-N.\n\n219\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.060\nCongratulations, you won a banana.\n\n220\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.630\nThat's actually how it should\nplay out to some extent.\n\n221\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.498\nI didn't know what letters\nI was getting right, so\n\n222\n00:12:20.498 --> 00:12:23.552\nthat part of the presentation is bad.\n&gt;&gt; I was a little like,\n\n223\n00:12:23.552 --> 00:12:25.025\nhow did you know it was banana?\n\n224\n00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:26.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n225\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.950\nI know most of my words have an a and\npossibly one with a b.\n\n226\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.945\n&gt;&gt; You were going down through the, yeah.\n\n227\n00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:33.232\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gaming the system,\n\n228\n00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:33.860\nVonne.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.250\n&gt;&gt; I was gaming the system.\n\n230\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.770\nBut now that I know that logic works,\nI've simplified my code.\n\n231\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.310\nNow I can focus.\n\n232\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.250\nIf we come back to our list, well, make\nthe one condition based on the number.\n\n233\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.510\nWe've done that.\n\n234\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.360\nCheck mark.\n\n235\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.930\nRemove extraneous print statements.\n\n236\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.290\nWe've done that.\n\n237\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.270\nDisplay blanks if a letter\nhas not been guessed.\n\n238\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.770\nWe need to do that.\n\n239\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.590\nDisplay the letter if\nthe letter has been guessed.\n\n240\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.870\nAnd to some extent, these are the same.\n\n241\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.060\nSo where am I going?\n\n242\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.110\nI don't know where I'm going.\n\n243\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.650\n[LAUGH] We're gonna come back here.\n\n244\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.390\nSo let's go through this, actually, Vonne,\n\n245\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.920\nhow you said, while through,\nclear the screen, letter.\n\n246\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.380\nTake an input, and then where should\n\n247\n00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.710\nthe print out of what you guessed and\nwhat you have not guessed occur?\n\n248\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.990\nShould it occur before you take a guess?\n\n249\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.080\nAbove it in this context?\n\n250\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:38.800\nSo if I say python3 main, should it\nbe above or below or what's going on?\n\n251\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.210\nI would argue that it would\nbe nice to be below, but\n\n252\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.690\nit's kinda hard to paint that if\nyou're taking guesses like this.\n\n253\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.940\nSo we may have to put it above and\nactually push that prompt to the bottom.\n\n254\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.240\nJust because, well, that's the nature\nof how the program's executing.\n\n255\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.650\nAnd there's nothing we can change\nabout that because that's Python\n\n256\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.180\nitself.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n257\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.730\nI kinda go either way on that one,\nhonestly.\n\n258\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.273\nSince we saw it above before, when we had\nwhere it was printing out the word and\n\n259\n00:14:06.273 --> 00:14:09.967\nthen none, none, none, it's like,\nwell, that was above it,\n\n260\n00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:11.187\nwasn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n261\n00:14:11.187 --> 00:14:12.336\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n262\n00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:15.098\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm inclined to put it above it so\n\n263\n00:14:15.098 --> 00:14:19.610\nI can print out white so you can see and\nthen make a guess at the end.\n\n264\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:26.725\nSo, with that said,\nwhat I'm thinking is maybe to say,\n\n265\n00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:31.170\nprint, what do we wanna print?\n\n266\n00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.390\nWell, we want to now take\nthe letters of a selected word, and\n\n267\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.260\nhere's my logic, let's do this.\n\n268\n00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.220\nWe're gonna use since this is a list,\nwe're going to print and let's just say\n\n269\n00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.780\njoin like that, so\nthis is a string method.\n\n270\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.480\nI'm going to join with a space\nbetween each letter, and\n\n271\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.750\nnow, I'm gonna use a list comprehension.\n\n272\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.280\nAnd that gives me kind of a for loop\ninside instead of having to do if's and\n\n273\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.990\nelse's and things.\n\n274\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.040\nThis is a very pythonic.\n\n275\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.370\nNot all languages have this accessible.\n\n276\n00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.690\nBut I think it's a little easier\nto read and reason about,\n\n277\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.610\njust kind of in one line.\n\n278\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:18.070\nVonne may have a different opinion and\nso we'll take that into consideration.\n\n279\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.120\nI'm probably not gonna change it.\n\n280\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.160\nBut we'll take it into consideration.\n\n281\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:27.570\nSo what I'm gonna say is\ngive me the letter if letter\n\n282\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:33.580\nis not none, else give me.\n\n283\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.620\nWell, let's just do this, a blank.\n\n284\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.220\nSo print the letter if it's there.\n\n285\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.860\nFor the letter n,\nletters of selected work.\n\n286\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.620\nSo let me zoom out just a little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n287\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.110\nAnd I'm gonna break this line and\ntab it over.\n\n288\n00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.638\nSo if I read this,\nrun through every letter,\n\n289\n00:15:55.638 --> 00:15:59.507\nif the letter is not none-\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, do you mind zooming in just\n\n290\n00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:02.921\na little bit, just cuz I feel\nlike I got it the first time and\n\n291\n00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.220\nthen as soon as you\nkept going I lost it so\n\n292\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.481\nI wanna Watch as you explain it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n293\n00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:11.900\nso these are either gonna be\nthe letters that I've guessed or nones.\n\n294\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.440\nGive me the letter if\nthe letter is not none.\n\n295\n00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:20.010\nOtherwise instead of giving me the none,\ngive me a blank for\n\n296\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.710\nevery letter in the letters_of_the_word,\nokay?\n\n297\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.370\nAnd that join, all that does is go,\nsmash them together with spaces between\n\n298\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:33.180\neach of those pieces.\n&gt;&gt; And join is a Pythonic word, or\n\n299\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.050\na keyword, it's one of those.\n&gt;&gt; It's a method on a string.\n\n300\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.540\nSo string, what do I wanna join them with?\n\n301\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.490\nWell, I wanna join them with a space and\nthen join all of these things.\n\n302\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.770\nBe very careful,\nyou have to have strings inside of these.\n\n303\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.673\nSo a letter and this other thing\nare also in quotes behind the scenes.\n\n304\n00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:55.030\nIf they're not, then this will\nactually fail, so keep that in mind.\n\n305\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.100\nSo if we do that,\nlet's see what our output is,\n\n306\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.230\nwe've typed a single line of code,\nis it a little denser?\n\n307\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.300\nSure.\n\n308\n00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.940\nIs there another way to do this?\n\n309\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.872\nAbsolutely, all right?\n\n310\n00:17:07.872 --> 00:17:12.500\nBut if I'm now coming, give me the letter\nfor every letter if it's not none,\n\n311\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.820\notherwise give me a blank for every\nletter in the letters of selected word.\n\n312\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.380\nWhich is just these things.\n\n313\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:26.010\nLet's go look, so I'm gonna\nCtrl+C,.look at that, clear that out.\n\n314\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.420\nPython3main.py, and\nnow there's all of our blanks.\n\n315\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.580\nSo that's handy.\n\n316\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.710\nVonne, I'm gonna give you the honor\nof guessing the first letter.\n\n317\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.825\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, I forgot our words.\n\n318\n00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:40.712\n[LAUGH] O.\n&gt;&gt; O, nope.\n\n319\n00:17:40.712 --> 00:17:41.582\n&gt;&gt; A.\n\n320\n00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:44.668\n&gt;&gt; A, yep.\n\n321\n00:17:44.668 --> 00:17:46.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I know it now.\n\n322\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.310\n&gt;&gt; And so we can guess a P, an l, and\n\n323\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.040\nan E.\n\n324\n00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:57.300\nSo we got kind of a weird\nruntime bug though.\n\n325\n00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.700\n&gt;&gt; We get, we didn't actually put the E\n\n326\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.120\nin the space, but\nit did what we told it to do.\n\n327\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.710\nIt was like hey did we\nfill all the blanks?\n\n328\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.300\nThat if statement,\n\n329\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.010\ndisplay the congratulations.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n330\n00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.742\n&gt;&gt; So that worked.\n\n331\n00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:12.775\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we got to,\n\n332\n00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:14.470\nwe need to track down that bug.\n\n333\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.270\nAnd this is a very realistic,\nbut it more or less works.\n\n334\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.050\nLet's go look at our,\nother than the bug, right?\n\n335\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.000\nAnd if I, you know what I just realized?\n\n336\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.313\nThat did not have a save on it, so\nI may have changed one thing so\n\n337\n00:18:31.313 --> 00:18:35.265\na, b, o, r, n, g, e\n&gt;&gt; There's our word.\n\n338\n00:18:35.265 --> 00:18:37.577\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now there we go so\n\n339\n00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:39.920\nlooks like a save.\n\n340\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.820\nThis gets a little weird, right?\n\n341\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.810\nSo it still shows this\neven though the win.\n\n342\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.400\nAnd that's actually due to what Vonne\nbrought up earlier in the episode.\n\n343\n00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.270\nI'm gonna clear the screen.\n\n344\n00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.590\nI'm gonna print out all of the things,\nright?\n\n345\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.650\nAnd then I'm gonna ask for a guess.\n\n346\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.700\nWell if the guess is there, I'm gonna\nreplace that, so I'm collecting those.\n\n347\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.720\nAnd if there's no nones in there, then\nit will break, it will print and break.\n\n348\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.371\nHere's the trick,\nit never re-clears the screen.\n\n349\n00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:13.619\nSo when you do win like here,\n\n350\n00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:18.418\nwhen I guess E it says stop it\ndoesn't re-clear the screen.\n\n351\n00:19:18.418 --> 00:19:21.810\nSo you're always gonna have\nthat left-over one final blank.\n\n352\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.950\nSo we should probably fix that.\n\n353\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.450\nBut let's go look at our task display\nblanks, the letter's not been guessed.\n\n354\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.650\nDid we accomplish that?\n\n355\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.700\nWe sure did.\n\n356\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.710\nDisplay the letter if they\nletter has been guessed.\n\n357\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.830\nWe accomplished that as well.\n\n358\n00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.670\nThere is one final thing, Vonne,\nthat I think would be a little nicer\n\n359\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.500\nif we could push this down a little\nbit from the top of the screen.\n\n360\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:50.256\nAnd if we could clear the screen when\nwe actually get the final letter,\n\n361\n00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:56.256\nbefore displaying, hey you win.\n&gt;&gt; Are you saying the physical space?\n\n362\n00:19:56.256 --> 00:20:00.470\nWe want almost like a top margin to\nhave it so it's a little different,\n\n363\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.340\nit's not all the way up\nat the top of the screen.\n\n364\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.541\nThat's what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about.\n\n365\n00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:05.345\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n366\n00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:06.695\nI was hoping you were gonna do that,\n\n367\n00:20:06.695 --> 00:20:08.502\nbecause it's kinda\nbothering me a little bit.\n\n368\n00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:12.718\nI'm a crazy OCD about like vertical\nalignment and like spacing and\n\n369\n00:20:12.718 --> 00:20:14.360\neverything, so.\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\n\n370\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.700\nlet me temper your temper you,\njust a little bit.\n\n371\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.748\nI'm not guaranteeing that it's going\nto be perfectly vertically aligned.\n\n372\n00:20:20.748 --> 00:20:23.493\nBut I don't like the fact that it's\nlike everything's up in the left,\n\n373\n00:20:23.493 --> 00:20:24.790\nupper left hand corner, right?\n\n374\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.650\nSo, let's do that, and how do we do that?\n\n375\n00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:33.210\nWell, here's what I'm thinking:\nlet's address that if we win\n\n376\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.960\nthis is our clear screen.\n\n377\n00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.880\nSo all I did was select that\nentire line and I copied it, and\n\n378\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.000\nwhat I'm gonna say is, well,\njust clear the screen again.\n\n379\n00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.970\nIf you win, this is win, if you win,\nclear the screen again and\n\n380\n00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.580\nthen print congratulations, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:57.520\nSo if we come here and\nwe look at that, maybe, if we can.\n\n382\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.239\nA?\nNope.\n\n383\n00:20:58.239 --> 00:20:58.924\nO?\n\n384\n00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.038\nNope.\nB?\n\n385\n00:21:00.038 --> 00:21:00.769\nNope.\n\n386\n00:21:00.769 --> 00:21:01.780\n&gt;&gt; E.\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n387\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.506\n&gt;&gt; It's cheese.\n\n388\n00:21:02.506 --> 00:21:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Cheese, C-H-E-S.\n\n389\n00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.590\nCongratulations, you won\nwith the word cheese.\n\n390\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.890\nSo that's a little nicer in and of itself.\n\n391\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.964\nAnd now if we could just\n[SOUND] push it down, right?\n\n392\n00:21:15.964 --> 00:21:17.820\nGive it a top margin, right?\n\n393\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.620\nSo let's think about how to do this.\n\n394\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.230\nIf I could just effectively,\nprogrammatically\n\n395\n00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:26.960\nhit enter a bunch of times,\nthen that would allow me to do that.\n\n396\n00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.090\nAll right, here we go, I got it.\n\n397\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.090\nI think I got it.\n\n398\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.825\nI'm gonna come up here and\nadd another constant and call it new_line.\n\n399\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.850\nAnd this is a special character,\nthat on the terminal,\n\n400\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.460\nwill give us a new line character.\n\n401\n00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.400\nSo /n that's the slash above, backslash?\n\n402\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.450\nThat's a backslash.\n\n403\n00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.739\nAlways get those reversed\nthat are lean back.\n\n404\n00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:47.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's a backslash.\n\n406\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.580\n&gt;&gt; I did the same thing.\n\n407\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.570\nI always have to kinda think okay,\nit's leaning backwards at the left,\n\n408\n00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.470\ngoes to the right, forward.\n&gt;&gt; But then that's based on\n\n409\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.660\nperspective of which way it faces, what\ndirection you're facing at the beginning.\n\n410\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.350\nBut I'm gonna give a new line and\n\n411\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:06.700\nthen if I can put a new line a bunch of\ntimes before I turn in everything else.\n\n412\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.426\nThen I got it, all right.\n\n413\n00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:13.232\nSo here is what I'm thinking about doing,\nlet's clear the screen and\n\n414\n00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:17.793\nbefore we print these letters out,\nlet's just print new_line,\n\n415\n00:22:17.793 --> 00:22:20.494\nlet's just say ten times, all right?\n\n416\n00:22:20.494 --> 00:22:27.234\nI come back here and wow,\nthat's giant and main.py.\n\n417\n00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:30.480\nThere we go, I'm liking this better.\n\n418\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.400\nSo this is not perfectly vertically\naligned, but it is a little bit better.\n\n419\n00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.113\nBut I see Vonne kinda giving me this\ntwisted look like it's better, Justin,\n\n420\n00:22:40.113 --> 00:22:42.650\nbut I think you could make it even better,\n\n421\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.469\nbetter.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like it's like a dog where it's\n\n422\n00:22:45.469 --> 00:22:46.620\nlike, hm, what?\n\n423\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.120\nWait, but I have another question.\n\n424\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.048\nMy question is after you\nguess the word is the,\n\n425\n00:22:53.048 --> 00:22:58.706\ncongratulations you've won,\nis that going to go back to the top?\n\n426\n00:22:58.706 --> 00:23:05.480\nBecause the new line is only in that\nfirst part of the code of okay, start.\n\n427\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.024\nWouldn't it need to be back in\nthe whole once you display the, so\n\n428\n00:23:10.024 --> 00:23:14.756\nwould it go right between the print\ncongratulations you've won.\n\n429\n00:23:14.756 --> 00:23:17.550\nYou want to, hit Enter right there and\nput it right there again.\n\n430\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.510\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly correct\n\n431\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.160\n&gt;&gt; My gosh!\n\n432\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.543\n&gt;&gt; Yay you're learning stuff!\n\n433\n00:23:21.543 --> 00:23:24.273\nWe're actually gonna Ctrl+C out of\nthat because that's our old version,\n\n434\n00:23:24.273 --> 00:23:25.260\nit's not our new version.\n\n435\n00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.660\nLet's start a new version.\n\n436\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.597\nLet's see if we can do that.\n\n437\n00:23:29.597 --> 00:23:31.590\nAll right, A,O,B,C,H,E,S.\n\n438\n00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.510\nCongratulations, you won\nwith the word cheese.\n\n439\n00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:41.042\nInteresting enough, other than that\nlittle bit of presentation portion,\n\n440\n00:23:41.042 --> 00:23:45.030\nwe're kinda, we're good, right?\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say, like.\n\n441\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.750\n&gt;&gt; We're done.\n\n442\n00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:46.346\n&gt;&gt; This is,\n\n443\n00:23:46.346 --> 00:23:49.034\nI wanna put more words in our list and\nplay.\n\n444\n00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:52.790\nCuz I, we only had four words and\nI [LAUGH] forgot which ones we even had.\n\n445\n00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.852\nI was like wait, I know there's an apple\nand orange but I don't [LAUGH] remember\n\n446\n00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.179\nthe rest of them, so.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n447\n00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:01.831\nnotice that over the last few episodes\nwe made a plan, we worked the plan.\n\n448\n00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:06.444\nWe addressed individual pieces at\na time Our code isn't super clean.\n\n449\n00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:09.321\nNow, granted I've been programming\nin Python for awhile, so\n\n450\n00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:13.070\nthe way you would have accomplished this\nis probably different than the way I would\n\n451\n00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.670\nhave accomplished this.\n\n452\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.590\nBut I have chosen portions of the language\nthat I find to be more readable and\n\n453\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.230\neasier to reason about as you're starting.\n\n454\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.370\nLike this join portion,\nI find this readable.\n\n455\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.830\nIf you don't, then well,\n\n456\n00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.270\nyou can just do a for loop and kind of\ngrab all those things together, all right?\n\n457\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.110\nI'm not gonna show you that, because\nit actually ends up being really messy.\n\n458\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.480\nBut there are a few things.\n\n459\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.124\nSee this hard coded ten,\nand this hard coded ten?\n\n460\n00:24:41.124 --> 00:24:43.320\nAnd this hard coded blank?\n\n461\n00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.990\nIf I need to reuse those,\nthose actually have semantic meaning.\n\n462\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.040\nRight, what is ten?\n\n463\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.380\nWell, that's actually the top margin,\nright, effectively.\n\n464\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.795\nSo let's go grab this.\n\n465\n00:24:54.795 --> 00:24:56.100\nLet's cut this out.\n\n466\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.362\nLet's create a TOP_MARGIN =, and\n\n467\n00:25:00.362 --> 00:25:07.320\nI'm being a little loose\nwith the terminology here.\n\n468\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:14.065\nBut let's see, by the TOP_MARGIN,\nand then here, by TOP_MARGIN.\n\n469\n00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:17.600\nMaybe, by TOP_MARGIN, okay?\n\n470\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.850\nNow, if I wanted to replace it instead\nof ten, I just come up here and\n\n471\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.460\nchange it one place.\n\n472\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:30.810\nAdditionally, let's say this is\ncalled a blank, a word blank, okay?\n\n473\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.668\nSo I come up here, and I say blank.\n\n474\n00:25:33.668 --> 00:25:36.913\nAnd now if I ever wanted to change\nthe style of that, anywhere I use it,\n\n475\n00:25:36.913 --> 00:25:38.407\nit kind of propagates through.\n\n476\n00:25:38.407 --> 00:25:39.533\nLet's check it out.\n\n477\n00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:43.291\nLet's see if it works, and there we go.\n\n478\n00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:49.700\nSo A, with orange, yeah,\nI forget the words, too, Vonne.\n\n479\n00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.236\nAnd now everything still works,\nbut I have no hard coded values.\n\n480\n00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:56.373\nThese actually have meaning to me.\n\n481\n00:25:56.373 --> 00:25:58.230\nDo they necessarily have\nthe same meaning to everybody?\n\n482\n00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.170\nNo, but\nthis helps me remember what my code does.\n\n483\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.600\nWe've accomplished all of our tasks for\nthe subset.\n\n484\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.120\nWe have kind of a working game.\n\n485\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.240\nWe always win, and\nwe have a short word list.\n\n486\n00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.290\nSo those are things we can improve on,\nbut I would almost call this done.\n\n487\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:20.050\nAnd, well, if you know anything\nabout anything, we're never done.\n\n488\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.700\nBut think we're done for this episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about y'all, but\n\n489\n00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.660\nI feel like I've scored a win just\nbeing able to understand this.\n\n490\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.728\nI've followed the code, and I see it.\n\n491\n00:26:31.728 --> 00:26:36.708\nSo I'm feeling pretty proud of myself,\nyeah, so yay, victory.\n\n492\n00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:37.242\n[LAUGH] But\n\n493\n00:26:37.242 --> 00:26:41.750\nI know, like you said, we have a little\nbit more to go through in our game.\n\n494\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.890\nAnd so we'll be moving on to some more\nepisodes, and I can't wait for those.\n\n495\n00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.050\nSo thank you very much Justin.\n\n496\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.380\nThank you for joining us, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n497\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.832\nSigning off for DEVPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n498\n00:26:51.832 --> 00:26:52.644\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n499\n00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.165\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n500\n00:26:54.165 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.190\nHello, everyone, and welcome back to\nanother exciting edition of DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.370\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n4\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.750\nAnd we're moving on in our\nApplied Fundamentals Episode, yes,\n\n5\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.467\nit is the applied fundamentals day.\n\n6\n00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.900\n[LAUGH] I got a little bit confused for\na minute but that's okay.\n\n7\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.410\nIt's good because I have Justin Dennison\nhere to explain to us what this version\n\n8\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.410\ntwo hangman that we're move into is.\n\n9\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.981\nSo, hi Justin, welcome back and\ntake it away cuz I can't seem to talk.\n\n10\n00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:39.866\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n11\n00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.143\nwell I will definitely do that.\n\n12\n00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:45.008\nAnd yeah, I'm dubbing this\nversion two because technically,\n\n13\n00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.020\nwe have a game that we always win.\n\n14\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.570\nThose are best kind of games.\n\n15\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.430\nI wish the game of life was like that but\nsometimes it's not,\n\n16\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.390\nbut our hangman game is.\n\n17\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.150\nWe always win because we just kinda rake\nour hands across the keyboard until we\n\n18\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.754\nfinally get the word.\n\n19\n00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.595\nBut we do have a few things that\nmight make it a little more readable.\n\n20\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.287\nIt's a back and\nforth what we are gonna ready to do.\n\n21\n00:01:06.287 --> 00:01:08.895\nI wanna show you this because I\nwant you to have this thought\n\n22\n00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:11.555\nprocess in your mind\nas your building code.\n\n23\n00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:16.545\nIf it was me, it depends on,\na little bit on my mood and\n\n24\n00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:20.315\nalso what the future is planned for the\nfeature set that I am going to implement,\n\n25\n00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.260\nwhether I do all of this or not.\n\n26\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.530\nSo I'm gonna try to be very explicit\nabout that in this episode,\n\n27\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.710\nwhy am I doing it and\nkind of would you always do this or\n\n28\n00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.490\nnot.\n&gt;&gt; And since I went ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.840\nlooked back down at the episode notes, I\nrealized that the title of this episode is\n\n30\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.170\nRefactor Two Functions, and I know where\nwe are in the topic two for a version two.\n\n31\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.710\nWe talked about this off camera.\n\n32\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.130\nI've seen you do refactoring before.\n\n33\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.430\nLike you said, it's just kind of taking\nit and changing it around a little bit,\n\n34\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.390\nmaking it readable,\nmaking it a little cleaner.\n\n35\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.150\nAnd like you said, based on your mood it\ncould change, cuz I know there's a whole\n\n36\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.920\nbunch of ways you could do this.\n&gt;&gt; And you're absolutely correct,\n\n37\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.320\nthere's There's a bunch of patterns for\nrefactoring.\n\n38\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.790\nSo what do I mean by refactoring?\n\n39\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.530\nYou're changing it either to\nincrease maintainability, right?\n\n40\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.970\nI wanna come back and make changes and\nit's more maintainable.\n\n41\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.960\nOr to increase readability, or both,\nor to make it more performant.\n\n42\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.800\nOr to add what's called\nan abstraction layer,\n\n43\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.480\nwhere you're like,\nI see this being repeated a lot.\n\n44\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.740\nIs there some way that I can change it to\nwhere I've reduced repetitiveness, but\n\n45\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.340\nstill have clarity?\n\n46\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.840\nNow there's a bunch of these techniques,\nall we're doing is using\n\n47\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.810\npull up to functions,\nin order to improve readability.\n\n48\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.010\nNo guarantees about maintainability\ndepending on what features or\n\n49\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.590\nwhat additional things\nyou want your game to do.\n\n50\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I use my own words,\n\n51\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.950\nI like globalizing it.\n\n52\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.600\nLike you're saying,\nkinda taking repetitive code, and\n\n53\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.050\nyou kinda take that and\nmake it a global variable.\n\n54\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.085\nI keep saying I know that as\na specific term and language but\n\n55\n00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:00.510\nlike it's up here and then you can just\nlike keep on calling it throughout.\n\n56\n00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.075\nWe did a little bit of that in the last\nepisode where we took the blank,\n\n57\n00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:07.710\nmade it like a keyword if you wanna say.\n\n58\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.810\nAnd then use that throughout,\nso I mean that is.\n\n59\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.620\nThat was like a slight bit of refactoring.\n&gt;&gt; It was a slight bit of refactoring and,\n\n60\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.980\nwell, it was kind of a nice little\ntemptation, an intro if you will.\n\n61\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.770\nBut I think what's gonna make\nmost sense is if we do it, not,\n\n62\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.700\nwe're gonna weigh our options.\n\n63\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.890\nThere are some things that you may do or\nmay find that someone else may do.\n\n64\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.940\nBut I just wanna show you this and try to\nbe explicit about the thought process.\n\n65\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.810\nAnd then show you how you would\ngo about doing this thing.\n\n66\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.870\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n67\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.180\nAnd let's before we do anything else and\nI want to really emphasize this.\n\n68\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.010\nLet's go 372018.\n\n69\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.180\nWe are going to extract repeated.\n\n70\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.810\nActually rextract portions of\ncode to functions to increase.\n\n71\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.850\nWow, cannot spell Vonne, readability.\n\n72\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.610\nAll right, so that's our only goal.\n\n73\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880\nAnd let me scroll up here behind my head.\n\n74\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.130\nAnd I guess let's zoom in so\nyou can see that.\n\n75\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.210\nThat's our main goal right now,\nis to extract pieces of code\n\n76\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.900\nto improve readability so people aren't,\nif you're unfamiliar with what it does,\n\n77\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.140\nI'm hiding the implementation details so\nVonne can go.\n\n78\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.600\nThat's what that does without a care of,\nnow what does that do again?\n\n79\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.588\nSo I think that the most important one\nare kind of a foremost one that becomes\n\n80\n00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:32.540\nevident.\n\n81\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.803\nThis subprocess.call actually in\nprevious episode Vonne is like that.\n\n82\n00:04:36.803 --> 00:04:39.350\nThere is a lot going on here.\n\n83\n00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.465\nLet's actually extract this to a function\nto where we don't care if it's\n\n84\n00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:49.940\nsubprocess.call or something else clearing\nthe screen for us, what does this do?\n\n85\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.040\nIt clears the screen,\nit clears the terminal window.\n\n86\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.480\nRight, call cls, blah blah blah.\n\n87\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.870\nIt would be a lot nicer if I said\nclear_screen, like that, right?\n\n88\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.710\nSo if I did that instead\nof having this in my code,\n\n89\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.760\nthen that would make a lot more\nsense I think to someone else who is\n\n90\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.210\nreading my code.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n91\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.210\nthen what I call like the globalization.\n\n92\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.752\nLike making your key words,\nyour writing functions.\n\n93\n00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:24.272\nNow clear_screen will become a function\nthat does that line that's on top it and\n\n94\n00:05:24.272 --> 00:05:27.057\nthat's gonna go up to the top.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's exactly what we're\n\n95\n00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:32.496\ngonna do, we're gonna grab this\n&gt;&gt; Cut it, and then we're gonna come\n\n96\n00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:38.330\nabove main, and\nsay def clear_screen, and then boop.\n\n97\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.340\nAnd then, be careful when\nyou copy in paste in Python,\n\n98\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.644\nsometimes the tab gets all kinds of weird.\n&gt;&gt; What was that last thing you,\n\n99\n00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:45.968\nthe tab?\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n100\n00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:47.790\nright here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n101\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.924\n&gt;&gt; I had my indentation was off for\n\n102\n00:05:49.924 --> 00:05:53.670\nthe function, so\nall I did was hold Shift and hit Tab.\n\n103\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.670\nShift, Tab actually goes to the left and\nthen Tab is to the right.\n\n104\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.820\nSo there I have a clear screen.\n\n105\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.770\nAnd now what that means\nis everywhere that I had\n\n106\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.040\nthat really complicated line, guess what?\n\n107\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.620\nI'm going to say clear_screen, okay,\nso I have clear_screen, clear_screen.\n\n108\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.340\nNow if all Vonne saw,\n\n109\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.090\nthe logic is sometimes still a little\nlike, now what is he doing there?\n\n110\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.790\nThe logic is still a little more involved.\n\n111\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.280\nBut she's not gonna get bogged down, or\n\n112\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.200\nyou're not gonna get bogged down,\nor even you,\n\n113\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.430\nif you wrote it three months from now,\nyou're gonna go, what does that do again?\n\n114\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.585\nYou may have to look at what is\nsubprocess.cobble, but if you look at\n\n115\n00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.520\nclear_screen you'll go yeah,\nthat's gonna clear the screen for me.\n\n116\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.090\nI remember now.\n\n117\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.885\nSo that's our first refactor.\n\n118\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.570\nOkay, now, this print NEWLINE TOP_MARGIN,\nthat's a little better.\n\n119\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.130\nWe did that in the previous episode,\nthat's a little better.\n\n120\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.319\nI would almost say this\ncould be a function in and\n\n121\n00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.960\nof itself called print heading or print.\n\n122\n00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.150\nVonne, I'm gonna ask you for\na better verbage there.\n\n123\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.070\nThe top portion of a page,\nI don't, print top\n\n124\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.770\nsomething, any thoughts on that?\n&gt;&gt; It's a top\n\n125\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.660\nmargin.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.160\n&gt;&gt; In my world that's because I work in\n\n127\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.660\npage layout and everything like that.\n\n128\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.494\nSo, you got me there.\n\n129\n00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:18.025\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n130\n00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:23.675\nlet's just call it print_top_margin, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.315\nAnd you could name these different things.\n\n132\n00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:28.165\nPrint-\n&gt;&gt; Move on down, I mean,\n\n133\n00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:31.650\nI guess you can make this up however\nit makes sense in your brain of like\n\n134\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.100\nmove it on down, top margin.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n135\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.170\n&gt;&gt; Do that.\n\n136\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.440\n&gt;&gt; So print_top_margin and\n\n137\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.090\nI'm also gonna replace this\nwith print_top_margin.\n\n138\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.530\nOkay, I've made small changes\nthat I'm pretty confident about.\n\n139\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.766\nBut the remaining ones,\nthey might be a little more involved.\n\n140\n00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:54.480\nSo before I do anything else,\nif you're doing this, we need to test it.\n\n141\n00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.336\nWe need to make sure that we haven't\nchanged anything about our code.\n\n142\n00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.146\nThat will change the dynamics of the game.\n\n143\n00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:04.299\nThe goal of refactoring is\nto make the code better,\n\n144\n00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:08.940\nnot to ultimately change\nhow the code works, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.096\nSo if we come over here and\nwe clear out and we Python3 Main.\n\n146\n00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:17.140\nThat's good, we've printed the top margin,\nwe've cleared the screen.\n\n147\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.965\nLet's make sure that we didn't\naccidentally break anything else.\n\n148\n00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:25.500\nA-P-L-E, congratulations,\neverything's still working.\n\n149\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.770\nSo score, chalk it up for a win.\n\n150\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.910\nNow if we come back and\nwe look through here.\n\n151\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:37.790\nWhat are some other things that\nare a little unclear, right?\n\n152\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.150\nAnd this is very much person to person.\n\n153\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.560\nIf I look down through here, I would say,\nsee this like if letter in or blah blah.\n\n154\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.550\nThis could read a little bit,\n\n155\n00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.530\nwhat's the intention of this\nentire nested portion, right?\n\n156\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.650\nI've shown it a couple of episodes and\n\n157\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.090\nevery once in a while I'm like well,\nthis is what it's doing.\n\n158\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.240\nAnd I do that because this may not\nnecessarily be clear every time\n\n159\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.990\nyou read through it.\n\n160\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:10.290\nBut if I look through this chunk of code,\nright, it is a selected\n\n161\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:16.920\nword and we're looking at\nthe letter that you've chosen.\n\n162\n00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.950\nThose are the two pieces of information\nthat we need in order to run through this.\n\n163\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.600\nAs well as the letter, not that,\n\n164\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.310\nthe letters of the selected word\nwe're gonna bring back, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:39.660\nSo if it was like update, wait for it,\n\n166\n00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:46.780\ncorrect_letters or\nsomething of that nature, right?\n\n167\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:54.530\nWhat I would want is\nletters_of_selected_word.\n\n168\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.980\nAnd this is where it gets, I'm reassigning\na variable that I've assigned before.\n\n169\n00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.390\nI can do that in Python.\n\n170\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.893\nSo here, as soon as it hits here it\nwould be a something new, all right?\n\n171\n00:10:04.893 --> 00:10:08.449\nWhat I'm thinking is if I\nupdate correct_letters,\n\n172\n00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:12.920\nthen I'm going to give it\nthe letter that I guessed.\n\n173\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:19.530\nI'm going to give it the selected\nword that we chose as the game began.\n\n174\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:26.010\nAnd then we're going to say well,\ndo I need to say anything I guess?\n\n175\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.910\nWe'll see.\n\n176\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.460\nLet's just go ahead and pass in the old\nletters of selected_word, all right?\n\n177\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.224\nSo I've passed in three parameters,\nthe letter,\n\n178\n00:10:36.224 --> 00:10:40.870\nthe selected word and\nthe letters of the selected word, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.020\nWhat I want is to be able to go,\nbloop, cut that.\n\n180\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.415\nAnd hide that behind and\nupdate correct_letters.\n\n181\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.960\nNaming's hard, but let's try to do this.\n\n182\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:01.250\nAnd sometimes you have to change\nthe logic a little bit when you do these.\n\n183\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.490\nSo, this is the guessed letter.\n\n184\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.950\nNo, sometimes your editor\nalso tries to install things.\n\n185\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:10.730\n&gt;&gt; Not now.\n\n186\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Guessed letter, right?\n\n187\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.360\nI'm renaming these just to let\nyou know this is my intention\n\n188\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.260\ninternal to the function.\n\n189\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.880\nAnd then the selected word\nI'm keeping that the same,\n\n190\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.290\nbecause I think that\nintention is still clear.\n\n191\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:32.894\nAnd then, I guess previous state\n\n192\n00:11:32.894 --> 00:11:38.065\nof guesses, like that.\n\n193\n00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:39.780\nNow, why am I doing that?\n\n194\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.420\nBecause this function, if I look at\nthis function, what does it take?\n\n195\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.310\nIt takes the letter that you've guessed,\nit takes the word that was\n\n196\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.630\nselected on game run and then it\ntakes the previous state of guesses.\n\n197\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.640\nWhat do I mean?\n\n198\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.070\nWhen we start out,\nyou have guessed no letters, so\n\n199\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.600\nall of the blanks are none, right?\n\n200\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.910\nAll of those spaces are known.\n\n201\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.490\nI want to take this in to account and\nkind of pull this back out.\n\n202\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:07.446\nIt may be that I don't need\nthis every time, all right?\n\n203\n00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:15.518\nSo if I now paste this, right?\n\n204\n00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:18.510\nThen these don't match.\n\n205\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:23.737\nSo where I see letter,\nI should see guessed_letter,\n\n206\n00:12:23.737 --> 00:12:26.814\nlike that, guessed_letter.\n\n207\n00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:29.931\nSelected_word is the same, and\n\n208\n00:12:29.931 --> 00:12:35.030\nthen previous_state_of_guesses, all right?\n\n209\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.840\nAnd then at the very end I'm going\nto return previous_state_of_guesses.\n\n210\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.970\nSo I'm gonna take it,\nupdate it and spit it back out.\n\n211\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.310\nThe one thing I don't like about this is,\nI'm actually changing something that I'm\n\n212\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.740\npassing into the function,\nwhich is kind of hard to reason about.\n\n213\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:58.390\nSo I'm gonna create a variable and\nsay new state equals,\n\n214\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.770\nand I'm just gonna create a list\nfrom the previous guesses.\n\n215\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.740\nSo I'm essentially making a copy, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.010\nAnd now, I'm gonna say new_state,\n\n217\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.870\nNew_state and then, new_state, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.060\nI will forewarn you, this is probably\ngoing to do some weird stuff,\n\n219\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.880\nbut that's all right.\n\n220\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.920\nSo we're good here.\n\n221\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.136\nWe're gonna update correct_letters and\n\n222\n00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:32.838\nwe're t gonna get back the next set\nof blanks effectively, all right.\n\n223\n00:13:32.838 --> 00:13:36.970\nSo letters_of_selected_word\nare actually used to draw the blanks.\n\n224\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.735\nI've done a great deal of changes,\nwe should probably test.\n\n225\n00:13:41.735 --> 00:13:43.130\nVonne, I'm going to ask you to cross your\n\n226\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.030\nfingers.\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n227\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:51.069\n&gt;&gt; So boom, A,B,O,R ,N,G,E.\n\n228\n00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:55.367\nEverything still works,\nit's good but now guess what?\n\n229\n00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:56.931\nI take out these spaces.\n\n230\n00:13:59.424 --> 00:14:02.990\nIt's a little easier to read,\nthe naming could be better.\n\n231\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.650\nI'm trying to be a little\nmore transparent.\n\n232\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.550\nI would probably name this a little\nmore concisely for me personally.\n\n233\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.310\nBut what do we do?\n\n234\n00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.930\nWell we clear the screen,\nprint the top margin.\n\n235\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:16.830\nAnd then we're gonna deal with that\nbecause that's kind of nestled and\n\n236\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.690\nwe take a guess.\n\n237\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.230\nAnd then the letters of selected\nwords is now, well we're gonna update\n\n238\n00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.928\nbased on the letter and the selected\nword and what we previously selected.\n\n239\n00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:33.160\nOkay, all right, if we look at two,\nwe got this line we haven't touched.\n\n240\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.420\nWe've got this line we haven't touched.\n\n241\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.640\nAnd we have this line that we\nhaven't touched, well this block.\n\n242\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.740\nI think is block is a little more of\na low hanging fruit, what does this do?\n\n243\n00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:54.130\nWell this actually checks\nto see if we win, right?\n\n244\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.480\nSo let's see here.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're gonna change some\n\n245\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.840\nthese words around to say like if win and\n\n246\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.890\nthen win equals that whole block in\nthe simplest way that I could say it.\n\n247\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.260\n&gt;&gt;

The sideways glance was more of\n\n292\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:02.140\nthe like, I'm following,\nit's like okay yeah, you're just I'd also\n\n293\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.280\nlike to refracture what I said before.\n&gt;&gt;

String\n\n395\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.514\nthings-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n396\n00:24:30.514 --> 00:24:31.934\n&gt;&gt; Is what you're trying,\n\n397\n00:24:31.934 --> 00:24:34.560\n.lower can happen with string things.\n\n398\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.120\nIt may happen on other ones.\n\n399\n00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.110\nBut it is not guaranteed,\nit's guaranteed on string things.\n\n400\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.970\nOkay, so\nwithout getting to deep in terminology.\n\n401\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.866\nBut if I were to hide away all these\nother little functions that I've written,\n\n402\n00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:48.810\nyou'd go, okay,\n\n403\n00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.569\nI get a selected word, I created a bunch\nof letters, right, the place holders.\n\n404\n00:24:53.569 --> 00:24:58.897\nAnd I could probably even change this to\nguesses, and then say wow, you've not won,\n\n405\n00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:03.125\nclear the screen, print the top margin,\nprint letters or blanks.\n\n406\n00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:06.292\nAnd then take a letter guess, and I've\nhidden away the fact that if you give me\n\n407\n00:25:06.292 --> 00:25:09.390\na bunch of letters,\nI'll only take the first one.\n\n408\n00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.530\nAnd then we'll update correct letters,\nreturn that and\n\n409\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.150\nthen that gets checked here.\n\n410\n00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.306\nAnd it just [SOUND] and\neverything is easy peasy lemon squeezy.\n\n411\n00:25:18.306 --> 00:25:22.436\nLet's see if it still works\nafter adding that to lower and\n\n412\n00:25:22.436 --> 00:25:25.460\nactually it should work better, right?\n\n413\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:32.049\nSo, no b, no, okay, c, H,\nnotice there's a capital H there.\n\n414\n00:25:32.049 --> 00:25:34.390\nIt still detects it.\n\n415\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.930\nAnd that is a, I think, a better\nexperience when you're playing a game\n\n416\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.830\nwithout being nit-picky about upper case,\nlower case.\n\n417\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.500\nAnd, well,\nwe have now refactored to functions,\n\n418\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.570\nI think it's made it\na great deal more readable.\n\n419\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:52.370\nBut, you may have done it a different way,\nsomeone else may do it a third way,\n\n420\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.330\nthere's not a whole lot of hard and\nfast rules other than just be aware,\n\n421\n00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.490\nrepetition is a,\nI see this being repeated a lot.\n\n422\n00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.580\nIt's a good chance to refactor.\n\n423\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.200\nIf it's hard to reason about, or hard for\nsomeone else to read it and reason about,\n\n424\n00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.104\nmaybe putting in a function\nthat is more relatable or\n\n425\n00:26:10.104 --> 00:26:13.088\nat least conveys your intention,\n[SOUND] it's good.\n\n426\n00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:15.580\nYour function should also be fairly small.\n\n427\n00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.200\nNotice that none of these\nfunctions are too long.\n\n428\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.930\nOur game wasn't too long, but\n\n429\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.970\nI'm not saying a function should be 700\nlines that does a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n430\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.945\nSmall individual pieces of\nlogic that just run and\n\n431\n00:26:28.945 --> 00:26:32.315\nnow we're good to go.\n&gt;&gt; Very modular, yes, and\n\n432\n00:26:32.315 --> 00:26:35.865\nthis is also the thing that\nlike messes me up about code.\n\n433\n00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:39.526\nIs because it's down here but\nit's up here and so\n\n434\n00:26:39.526 --> 00:26:44.275\nit kinda starts to become this\nlike line of strings as I call it.\n\n435\n00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:48.856\nStrings as in making lines of yarn\ntrying to connect everything.\n\n436\n00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:51.590\nBut you just have to read it logically.\n\n437\n00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.884\nBut I guess that's why coders are so much\nof write it one way and then go back and\n\n438\n00:26:55.884 --> 00:26:56.622\nclean it up.\n\n439\n00:26:56.622 --> 00:27:00.150\nRefactoring is a big thing and I know\nit's a big thing in the coding world.\n\n440\n00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.470\nSo I'm glad that was a nice little\nkind of tutorial on that and\n\n441\n00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.770\nI'm feeling okay about this.\n\n442\n00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:06.700\nI really am.\n\n443\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.940\nSo thank you so\nmuch about showing all that to us, Justin.\n\n444\n00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.990\nAnd thank you all for watching.\n\n445\n00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.900\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n446\n00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.690\nSigning off for DEVPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n447\n00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.525\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n448\n00:27:16.525 --> 00:27:18.886\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n449\n00:27:18.886 --> 00:27:20.724\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Vonne Smith, and\n\n3\n00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:21.508\nwe're moving through our apply\nfundamentals hangman series.\n\n4\n00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:25.676\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about adding a scoreboard, and\n\n5\n00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:29.591\nhere to keep a score on what we're\nlearning is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:30.400\nHow are you?\n\n7\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Vonne.\n\n8\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.100\nHow are you today?\n\n9\n00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.068\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n10\n00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:36.120\nWe've talked through our game, and\nwe've added a whole bunch of things.\n\n11\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.570\nDone some refactoring,\nputting the puzzle pieces and nicknames,\n\n12\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.640\nI was calling it, and now,\nwe're moving on into another topic and\n\n13\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.100\nwe're gonna Add some more pizzazz,.\n\n14\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.800\n&gt;&gt; It's a little bit of pizzazz,\n\n15\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.740\nbut really I'm thinking this is\nthe beginning of a new feature set,\n\n16\n00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.830\nbecause as it stands, our game,\nwell, you're always a winner.\n\n17\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.980\nAnd as much as those games are fun to\nplay, they're not really realistic.\n\n18\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.090\nReally realistic, that is redundant.\n\n19\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.928\nBut that'll be all right.\n\n20\n00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:12.014\nSo what I'm thinking is over the next few\nepisodes, we're gonna to add a scoreboard.\n\n21\n00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:16.083\nWe're gonna keep track of how\nmany times you've guessed, and\n\n22\n00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:21.071\nwe have to be careful there because back\nin our previous episode, Ron and I had\n\n23\n00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:27.190\na discussion about this, it's not just\nguesses, it's incorrect guesses, right?\n\n24\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.940\nSo I want to keep track of how\nmany incorrect guesses you've had.\n\n25\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.500\nAnd if you have an incorrect guess,\nI want to increment that and\n\n26\n00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.430\nkind of show you at the bottom.\n\n27\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.380\nSo that's ultimately what we're\ngonna do in this episode, but\n\n28\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.270\nthat's in preparation for, hey,\nyou have a certain number of guesses and\n\n29\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.370\nif you don't get in those guesses,\nyou lose which is unfortunate.\n\n30\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.402\n&gt;&gt; Aw, I don't like to lose.\n\n31\n00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:46.922\n[LAUGH] But\n\n32\n00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:50.769\nI do remember talking about this even\nlike when we were playing it out.\n\n33\n00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:52.054\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And drawing things right.\n\n34\n00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:56.370\nAnd I was just having so much fun\nthroughout this whole thing that I forgot\n\n35\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.735\nabout that part and so I guess we have\nto have some reality back into this.\n\n36\n00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:01.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n37\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.530\nWell, we can always win but\nwe can at least learn and\n\n38\n00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.150\nbe better that we were yesterday.\n\n39\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.150\nSo that's important.\n\n40\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.250\n&gt;&gt; And I call that a win.\n\n41\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Then,\n\n42\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.710\nI would also call that a win.\n\n43\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.840\nSo let's go ahead and get started, come\ndown into your computer screen here and\n\n44\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.740\nyou were like, wow, it's just blank text.\n\n45\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.070\nI'm actually going to zoom\nthis in just a little bit, so\n\n46\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.410\nyou can see a little better.\n\n47\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.859\nIt's not great, and\nthat's just because of real estate, right?\n\n48\n00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.857\nSo there we go, we have our hangman and\n\n49\n00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:35.560\nif we look at current time,\nthis is the dynamic of our game.\n\n50\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.512\nAre we clear?\nAll right, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:39.670\nI got, I got you, it's looking good.\n\n52\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.090\nThis is way better than where we started.\n\n53\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.710\nI was trying the A,\nI think it's orange, and there, we go.\n\n54\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.960\nCongratulations, orange.\n\n55\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.378\nSo we win.\n\n56\n00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:57.477\nBut if I, just to give you some in\ndepth of this of why we're doing this.\n\n57\n00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:02.205\nIf I just keep guessing the same, I can\ndo this forever and ever and ever and\n\n58\n00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:05.550\never and ever and ever and\nI will never lose.\n\n59\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.866\nI don't know if you've ever\nactually played Hangman or\n\n60\n00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:11.381\nsomeone in real life if they'd guessed the\nsame letter over and over and over again.\n\n61\n00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.640\nNumber one, it's annoying.\n\n62\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.286\nNumber two, I'm not sure they\nunderstand how to play the game so\n\n63\n00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:16.903\nyou should probably review the rules.\n\n64\n00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:19.970\nAnd number three,\nthat game would go on forever.\n\n65\n00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.140\nThere has to be a limitation.\n\n66\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.120\nAnd to some extent, for Hangman,\nthat's we're gonna stay away from the or\n\n67\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.940\njust gonna keep it as number when play\nchildhood, kind of a childhood game.\n\n68\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.423\nIt was you're doing the Gallo walk and\n[SOUND] well,\n\n69\n00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.996\nthen things got a little weird.\n\n70\n00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:41.460\n&gt;&gt; I remember playing where anybody that\nguessed you write down the letter off to\n\n71\n00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.040\nthe side so that way you know no,\nyou already guessed the J.\n\n72\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.825\nSo you would keep track of it.\n\n73\n00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:50.125\nYes, that had already been chosen.\n\n74\n00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.995\nWe're not doing that in this particular.\n\n75\n00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:53.655\nI'm like, that's outside of the scope.\n\n76\n00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:55.355\nI'm making things more complicated,\naren't I?\n\n77\n00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:56.775\n&gt;&gt; Vonne and her scope creep.\n\n78\n00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:57.695\nI'll tell you what.\n\n79\n00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:01.425\nIt is something that I'm gonna\nhave to keep a tight hold on.\n\n80\n00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:03.925\nBut that would actually be\na very interesting feature that,\n\n81\n00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:07.025\nwhen we get finished together,\nthat could be an expansion.\n\n82\n00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:11.640\nLet me just make a list of letters\nthat I've already guessed, right, and\n\n83\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.290\nmaybe add an additional block.\n\n84\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.310\n&gt;&gt; Just thinking it through cuz that\nwas like the whole index of where it is\n\n85\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.840\nin the letter.\n\n86\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.340\nSo if you had a, when we were guessing an,\na, well, that's in the word.\n\n87\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.790\nSo well, I know that that's part of it.\n\n88\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.430\nIt's like if I have the alphabet,\nyou pick that.\n\n89\n00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.430\nIt's the same context or\nthe same concept, right?\n\n90\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.270\n&gt;&gt; You're not and there's probably three\nother ways that you can accomplish\n\n91\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.290\nthe same task, but\nthat's not what we're after.\n\n92\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.190\nWe're actually here to\nbuild a score board.\n\n93\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.020\nAnd I bring this up in addition\nto because I'm thinking\n\n94\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.170\nmaybe the score board is just,\nwe'll start here with maybe.\n\n95\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.170\nRight below, but\nbefore we take another guess,\n\n96\n00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.380\nwe just print how many guesses they made,\nhow many incorrect guesses.\n\n97\n00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.310\nSo we'll have an additional\nprint scoreboard, I think.\n\n98\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.970\nAnd because we re-factored\nthis into functions,\n\n99\n00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.330\nwe'll probably do that as we go along,\nbecause we're at our working state, and\n\n100\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.420\nwe want to keep things clean and readable.\n\n101\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.130\nSo I'm going to go ahead and get out\nof this, clear and we're good to go.\n\n102\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.290\nIf we come back,\nwe got a lot of functions now.\n\n103\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.640\nAnd it's really odd because you're,\nlike, this is a simple game.\n\n104\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.560\nAnd we see that it actually gets more,\nand more not simple as we go.\n\n105\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.455\nBut for a Read Me, we always gotta\nkeep track of what we're doing.\n\n106\n00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:32.150\nAnd so 3/8/2018,\nwe are going to add a scoreboard\n\n107\n00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.830\nthat tracks the number of\nincorrect guesses, all right?\n\n108\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.270\nNow, if I wanted to further clarify that,\nthen I want to print the scoreboard.\n\n109\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.880\nIn order to do this, we need\nthe ability to print the scoreboard.\n\n110\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:58.128\nWe need to keep track of\nthe number of incorrect guesses,\n\n111\n00:05:58.128 --> 00:06:03.790\nand well, we're keeping track of a number,\n\n112\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.100\nwe need to modify that when we\ndo have an incorrect guess.\n\n113\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.080\nSo need to modify when\na guess is incorrect,\n\n114\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.250\nso need to modify guesses\nwhen a guess is incorrect.\n\n115\n00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.100\n&gt;&gt; We need to update.\n\n116\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.820\nWe need to update the current\nnumber of wrongs.\n\n117\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\nExactly.\n\n118\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.980\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n119\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.660\nAnd, for me, when the features are small,\n\n120\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.970\nI'm trying to simulate what I would do\nif something was very large, right?\n\n121\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.570\nThis isn't huge a feature so\nif you're like, what?\n\n122\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.820\nI probably wouldn't do the bullet points.\n\n123\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.770\nThat's fine.\n\n124\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.180\nBut if you have something\nthat's a little more complex,\n\n125\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.190\nthe subdivision of tasks\nis incredibly helpful.\n\n126\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.090\nBecause then you go,\nI just need to print the scoreboard.\n\n127\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.310\nThat's all I need.\n\n128\n00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.420\nAlso, do keep in mind, these are not\nordered by nature so in my mind I'm like,\n\n129\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.120\nwell, I know that I can do this other\nthing easier before I do the one.\n\n130\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.980\nSo for me, the keeping track and\nmodifying,\n\n131\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.720\nthose are actually linked together.\n\n132\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.860\nI'm gonna do that first because then,\nwe can always go back and print.\n\n133\n00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.420\nOkay, so here's what I'm thinking.\n\n134\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.110\nWe come over here to main.py,\nand we looked and to some extent,\n\n135\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.980\nour game loop is here,\nbut the initial state, and\n\n136\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.870\nhow it transforms over time,\nand what do I mean by state?\n\n137\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.310\nThink of it as a Polaroid.\n\n138\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.370\nClick, so\nwhen the game starts I take a picture.\n\n139\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.060\nBut then things are moving around.\n\n140\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.860\nPeople are making guesses on things.\n\n141\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.700\nYou take another picture and\nthat's how these are modified or updated.\n\n142\n00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.110\nSelected word will not\nchange during the game.\n\n143\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.970\nLetters of a selected\nword will though right.\n\n144\n00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.030\nWe have some state that is just starts,\nand that's what it is for the entire game.\n\n145\n00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.535\nBut the letters of a select word that\nactually updates as people make guesses.\n\n146\n00:07:51.535 --> 00:07:56.045\nSo and I'm thinking about this keeping\ncount of the number of incorrect\n\n147\n00:07:56.045 --> 00:08:00.490\nguesses is actually along the same\nlines as what is the selected word.\n\n148\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.423\nWhat are the starting states?\n\n149\n00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:06.283\nSo, I'm gonna say number\nof incorrect guesses and\n\n150\n00:08:06.283 --> 00:08:11.150\nyou're like, I wouldn't have\nnamed that variable that long.\n\n151\n00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.830\nYeah, but\nI don't have to think about this.\n\n152\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.540\nWhat does this mean?\n\n153\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.460\nNumber of incorrect guesses.\n\n154\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.790\nI'm gonna say zero.\n\n155\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.480\nThat makes sense.\n\n156\n00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.210\nWhen the game starts,\nyou have zero incorrect guesses.\n\n157\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.010\nThat would be a horrible game,\nif right off the bat,\n\n158\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.090\nyou're like I'm gonna ding you,\nyou get one.\n\n159\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.330\nSo, we will start with zero, and\nthen if our thinking through this and\n\n160\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.635\nif I'm referring be here, we need to keep\ntrack of number of incorrect guesses.\n\n161\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.070\nAnd that's for to clarify then.\n\n162\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.960\nWell, I'm kinda doing that now.\n\n163\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.084\nThis is how I'm going to track it,\nit's just with the simple variable and\n\n164\n00:08:43.084 --> 00:08:43.691\na number.\n\n165\n00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:47.668\nAll right,\nbefore we add any additional logic,\n\n166\n00:08:47.668 --> 00:08:51.470\nwhat I'm gonna do is just say,\nyou know what?\n\n167\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.280\nI'm thinking every time we make a guess,\nso take a letter guess,\n\n168\n00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.136\nevery time we make a guess, we're gonna\nsay number_of_incorrect_guesses and\n\n169\n00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:01.128\nplus equals 1.\n\n170\n00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:03.460\nAll right, so I've guessed, and\nI've guessed, and I've guessed.\n\n171\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.860\nThe larger it's run on this, because this\nwill actually increment that every time.\n\n172\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.980\n&gt;&gt; Regardless if they\nchose a correct letter, so\n\n173\n00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.670\nwe're not doing that kind of verification\nof it it's actually incorrect, or not.\n\n174\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so yeah,\nyou have to see it there, right.\n\n175\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.880\n&gt;&gt; But it is going to increase\nonce we put that parameter,\n\n176\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.670\nI think it's some type of If,\nor some checking thing [LAUGH].\n\n177\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.180\n&gt;&gt; You're on the right track, Vonne,\n\n178\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.820\nbut let's see if we've kind of broken\nanything, because we may have to\n\n179\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.780\nchange some preexisting code to\naccommodate our logic, all right?\n\n180\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.947\nMaybe not, maybe, but let's just see if\nwe've broken anything up until this point.\n\n181\n00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:49.920\nAll right, looks good.\n\n182\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.020\nThat has to be cheese then.\n\n183\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.030\nES, yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.260\nI won to a cheese.\n\n185\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.500\nI'm not putting that now, so\nit doesn't look like anything's happening.\n\n186\n00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.050\nSo, temporarily what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm going to come above\n\n187\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.630\nthis prompt, take letter guess,\nand I'm just gonna say,\n\n188\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.238\nprint number of incorrect\nguesses like that.\n\n189\n00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:15.970\nJust like so.\n\n190\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:24.236\nSo, it's gonna be a random word and\nso zero A, B.\n\n191\n00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:25.150\nMust be cheese again.\n\n192\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.720\nSo, now, okay, that's not bad.\n\n193\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.770\nYou have cheese, but notice I\ndidn't pass the number of guesses.\n\n194\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.710\nSo, it kind of went away.\n\n195\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.500\nSo, that's something to keep in mind.\n\n196\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.370\nBut it was counting up every\ntime we made a guess, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.050\nSo, we have keeping track,\nwe have updating, but\n\n198\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.570\nthere is a little more logic involved in\nmaking this workable as a score board.\n\n199\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.060\nSo, if I come over here, I mean to some\nextent, this is a score board, but\n\n200\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.580\nlet's create a function to,\nlet's call it print scoreboard,\n\n201\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.600\nand it's gonna take the number\nof incorrect guesses.\n\n202\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.980\nOkay.\n\n203\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.330\nNow, this scoreboard\nis negative in nature.\n\n204\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.560\nSome scoreboards are positive in nature.\n\n205\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.970\nBut these kind of games,\nit's kind of like golf.\n\n206\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.490\nThat bigger number's not good.\n\n207\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.800\nBut that's all right.\n\n208\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.270\nSo, we wanna print score board, so\nwe're gonna come here and say dev print\n\n209\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.590\nscoreboard, and it's gonna take the score.\n\n210\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.360\nOr what is the score?\n\n211\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.810\nWhat's the number of incorrect\nguesses in this case?\n\n212\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:38.640\nAll right, so all that's going to do,\nyou have guessed, you\n\n213\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.980\nhave incorrectly guessed,\nincorrectly guessed.\n\n214\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.246\n[BLANK AUDIO] Blank times.\n\n215\n00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:56.850\nYou have blank guesses left.\n\n216\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.310\nOkay, so that's what I'm thinking.\n\n217\n00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.170\nYou tell them how many\ntimes you've got them.\n\n218\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.100\nYou have this many left.\n\n219\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.220\nNow, this blank I'm going\nto temporarily just\n\n220\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.390\nkind of I'm just going to\nput a number there, okay.\n\n221\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.150\nBecause this will come back.\n\n222\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.180\nSo, this will never change.\n\n223\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:15.900\nThat's broke.\n\n224\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.470\nYou're like you just keep\nshowing us broke stuff, Justin.\n\n225\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.510\nI do.\n\n226\n00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.200\nBut it is important to think about\nall these little nuanced behaviors.\n\n227\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.820\nAnd this is gonna be\na format to the score.\n\n228\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.560\nSo, what that will do is whatever is\npassed in as score here will actually\n\n229\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.160\nreplace this open close curly brackets.\n\n230\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.630\nAll right, so we print the scoreboard,\nand I go to the Launchpad for\n\n231\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.120\nsome reason, and\nthen I'm gonna clear out Python 3 main.\n\n232\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.516\nOkay, so let's see here.\n\n233\n00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:49.044\nC, okay, c, c, c, c, c,\n\n234\n00:12:49.044 --> 00:12:53.340\nso we are actually keeping track.\n\n235\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.750\nWe are giving feedback to the user,\nbut we are still not using this for\n\n236\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.390\nkind of logic.\n\n237\n00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:04.115\nBut we have printed our scoreboard,\nall right.\n\n238\n00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:08.320\nNow, we do only want to\nincrement this now if\n\n239\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.750\nwe're not actually getting\na letter that's in there, okay.\n\n240\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.460\nSo, here's a letter.\n\n241\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.660\nLetters of selective word.\n\n242\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.140\nWe're updating.\n\n243\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.830\nBut really we just need, if letter not in\n\n244\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.710\nselected word, then I want to update.\n\n245\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.610\nNumber of incorrect guesses, all right?\n\n246\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.780\nSo, I was making sure all of my dynamics\nwere there, and then I came back and\n\n247\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.070\nI added logic around that, so\nthat it only conditionally updates.\n\n248\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.670\nSo, I think we're good.\n\n249\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.589\nAnd here we go.\n\n250\n00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:45.681\nYou're ready?\n\n251\n00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:50.763\nSo, I'm gonna [INAUDIBLE] this our and\nsay python 3 main, and\n\n252\n00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:56.220\nthen a, okay, a works,\nI'm gonna hit a again, it works.\n\n253\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.920\nBut I know this is Apple now, so I'm gonna\npick f, cuz I know that f is not in there.\n\n254\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.200\nI've guessed, incorrect guessed one time.\n\n255\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.270\nAnd really that should be not plural,\n\n256\n00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.630\nbut we're gonna act like\nnothing happened there.\n\n257\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.337\nAnd then, I'm gonna guess f again,\nbecause I know we're not,\n\n258\n00:14:16.337 --> 00:14:19.825\nmaking sure there's no duplicates there,\nbut\n\n259\n00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:24.204\nit's just incrementing over,\nand over, and over again.\n\n260\n00:14:24.204 --> 00:14:28.566\nThis isn't updating, but we'll get there,\nso our kind of dynamic, our feedback for\n\n261\n00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:31.160\nour user is actually working\nat this point in time.\n\n262\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.610\n&gt;&gt; And there you go.\n\n264\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.336\nIt is, sorry about that, Von.\n\n265\n00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thought you had a question.\n\n266\n00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:42.370\nI think Von start camera going.\n\n267\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:42.870\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n268\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.810\n&gt;&gt; I got you, I got you and\n\n269\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.020\nI was like, okay.\n\n270\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.924\n&gt;&gt; I am quite animated over here\nwhen you're going through stuff,\n\n271\n00:14:47.924 --> 00:14:49.549\nbecause I'm like Is that all good?\n\n272\n00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:51.798\nMh-hm, yeah, uh-huh, yeah!\n\n273\n00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:52.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.918\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what's going in my mind, and\n\n275\n00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:58.510\nI'm like, yeah,\nthat makes sense now, it's good!\n\n276\n00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.849\nThe other thing is that I attend\nwhen I wanna ask him a question,\n\n277\n00:15:01.849 --> 00:15:06.009\nI do something like this, and I got\na little too excited about understanding.\n\n278\n00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:09.248\nSo, I put my hand off and\n[LAUGH] you though I had a question.\n\n279\n00:15:09.248 --> 00:15:10.230\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n280\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.560\nIt happens.\nA little bit if that.\n\n281\n00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.600\nNow, Von, while we're here though,\nI do have a question.\n\n282\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.180\nIf I come back and I look,\nright now I have a hard coded file here.\n\n283\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.940\nRight?\n\n284\n00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.794\nAnd really this should\nstart at some number.\n\n285\n00:15:24.794 --> 00:15:30.090\nAnd then, kinda just decrement as\nthe number of incorrect scores go.\n\n286\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.290\nBut, if you think about it,\nin the traditional hangman game,\n\n287\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.730\nyou only got a finite number\nof guesses to begin with.\n\n288\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.580\nRight?\nSo, once you incorrectly guess so\n\n289\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.500\nmany times, you've lost.\n\n290\n00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.120\nSo, you have to kind of fit that limit,\nright?\n\n291\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.455\nBut, you think we're gonna use\nthat number only right here, or\n\n292\n00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:58.153\nwould I also need to have access in other\nfunctions, or other areas of this code?\n\n293\n00:15:58.153 --> 00:16:02.248\nKind of thinking toward the future, so\ncan I put it in just that function and\n\n294\n00:16:02.248 --> 00:16:02.903\nI'm good.\n\n295\n00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:05.315\nOr do I need put in other places?\n\n296\n00:16:05.315 --> 00:16:10.277\n&gt;&gt; I feel you're hinting to me that you\nneed to make it a global, you need to make\n\n297\n00:16:10.277 --> 00:16:14.639\nit to where, I'm gonna use like,\nit needs to go up in top up there.\n\n298\n00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.783\nOr you need to define it as a function,\nyou need that refactoring things so\n\n299\n00:16:17.783 --> 00:16:18.910\nyou could reuse it again.\n\n300\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Give it a nickname.\n\n301\n00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:22.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna give it a nickname,\nand it's actually a constant.\n\n302\n00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.365\nSo we're gonna say,\nlet's think of a good word that would, so\n\n303\n00:16:26.365 --> 00:16:28.940\nTOTAL_GUESSES_ALLOWED, right?\n\n304\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:35.150\nLet's call it TOTAL_GUESSES_ALLOWED,\nI think that makes sense.\n\n305\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.811\nAnd for now,\nlet's just say there are five.\n\n306\n00:16:36.811 --> 00:16:41.020\nI can't remember how many parts there\nare to that figure that you draw.\n\n307\n00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:46.000\nFive might be a little optimistic for\npeople getting it right, but remember,\n\n308\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.710\nI've already told you that optimal\nstrategy for this game, RSTLNE.\n\n309\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.013\nAnd then you can just look at word letter\nfrequencies in the English language,\n\n310\n00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:57.180\nif you know it's based on English, and\nthen just start guessing those in order.\n\n311\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.170\nAnd then you can figure out\nan output pretty easily.\n\n312\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, we also only have four words.\n\n313\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.210\nIf you play it enough it's like, okay,\nguess what, it's cheese, apple, orange,\n\n314\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.830\nand banana, so then they'll get the idea.\n\n315\n00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:12.002\nIf we had, like you said, some huge\nlist of words, then it'd be different.\n\n316\n00:17:12.002 --> 00:17:12.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n317\n00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:18.043\n&gt;&gt; In the scope of our project,\nlook at me I'm staying on scope for once.\n\n318\n00:17:18.043 --> 00:17:18.747\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n319\n00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:24.544\nnow that we have TOTAL_GUESSES_ALLOWED,\nwe can actually come back and\n\n320\n00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:28.200\nsay boop, right here and\nhere for our format.\n\n321\n00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:33.410\nSo our format when we do\nordered formatting, so\n\n322\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.960\nscore will go in the first blank.\n\n323\n00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.610\nWhat do I want to go in the second blank?\n\n324\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:44.650\nI actually want TOTAL_GUESSES_ALLOWED\nminus the score,\n\n325\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.260\ncuz as that goes up, then\nthe subtraction removes that remaining.\n\n326\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.380\nSo this is a computed value, again, that\nallows us to be a little more dynamic.\n\n327\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.455\nNow, it's kinda hard to read, so\nI'm gonna break this to the next line.\n\n328\n00:17:56.455 --> 00:18:01.414\nAnd I'm pretty sure, yup,\nmy string ends on that one line,\n\n329\n00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:05.028\nso I can do .format and\nsay score goes here.\n\n330\n00:18:05.028 --> 00:18:08.606\nAnd then you take\nthe TOTAL_GUESSES_ALLOWED minus how many\n\n331\n00:18:08.606 --> 00:18:12.389\nguesses you've made incorrectly thus far,\nand put that there,\n\n332\n00:18:12.389 --> 00:18:14.500\nand we should be good to go.\n\n333\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:20.769\n&gt;&gt; And it's okay to put it right\nthere in the format method?\n\n334\n00:18:20.769 --> 00:18:23.528\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, and we can put it here, but\n\n335\n00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:27.560\nsometimes that a little less readable,\nright?\n\n336\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:35.660\nHere's what I would probably do,\nguesses_left, is a calculated value.\n\n337\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.330\nAnd then I just say, guesses_left like so,\nevery time I that function runs.\n\n338\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:45.977\n&gt;&gt; I guess that's what I was wondering,\ncuz it seems like I'm used to, I'm very\n\n339\n00:18:45.977 --> 00:18:51.820\ngreen at this, but I'm used to just seeing\nit as just one word or variable there.\n\n340\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.890\nAnd so\nthen that's mapped to something else.\n\n341\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.660\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That's defined somewhere else.\n\n342\n00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.175\nWell, yeah.\n\n343\n00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:00.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And within a format we can actually,\n\n344\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.710\nas long as the expression can be\nsimplified, so something minus something.\n\n345\n00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.460\nIf those are both defined, the left and\n\n346\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.040\nthe right, then behind the scenes what\nwill happen is it will evaluate that and\n\n347\n00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.620\nsay, well, really it's these two numbers,\nlet's say it's five and\n\n348\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.190\none, subtract those, and I'm just gonna\nreplace that with a single number, four.\n\n349\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.420\nSo it would be like me hard\ncoding four inside of that.\n\n350\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:27.210\nSo that is allowed, but I agree,\nmaybe not the most readable all the time.\n\n351\n00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.400\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nthey're both correct, technically, and\n\n352\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.860\nit's really more of a stylistic thing.\n\n353\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.610\nIt's not going to hurt your processing or\npower of\n\n354\n00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.500\nhow it's gonna read it, optimization\nthat's what I'm trying to get to.\n\n355\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and if you're ever concerned\nabout that, at this stage in the game,\n\n356\n00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.350\nI would not concern\nourselves with that at all.\n\n357\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.210\nUnless you're like, well, I went to\nrun this thing and took five hours.\n\n358\n00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.550\nI thought it was gonna take 20 seconds.\n\n359\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.170\nThen you might have to address that.\n\n360\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.470\nBut otherwise, do not worry about it.\n\n361\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:02.630\nSo let's see how then we should have\na constantly updating guesses_left.\n\n362\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.678\nSo python3 main.py.\n\n363\n00:20:04.678 --> 00:20:09.850\nSo I've guessed 0 times incorrectly and\nI have 5 guesses left.\n\n364\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.069\nAn remember, that's a dynamic value,\nthat's actually a constant at top and\n\n365\n00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:14.740\nthen it's computed, all right?\n\n366\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.110\nSo if i say a, well, that's all right.\n\n367\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.170\nSo that's orange,\nthis is why you start with a limited set.\n\n368\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.468\nSo if it's orange, I'm gonna put b, and\nI'm gonna put b again, and then I'm\n\n369\n00:20:27.468 --> 00:20:31.795\ngonna put b again, and then I'm gonna put\nb again, and then I'm gonna put b again.\n\n370\n00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:34.526\nAnd at this point I should lose, but\n\n371\n00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:40.548\nthe main goal of this was to give you\nsome kind of scoreboard feedback, right?\n\n372\n00:20:40.548 --> 00:20:44.005\nThe feedback's there and\nnow the pressure's on, but before\n\n373\n00:20:44.005 --> 00:20:48.527\nwe worry about any of the logic, I think\nit's probably best just to let that veg,\n\n374\n00:20:48.527 --> 00:20:51.910\nthink about the thought\nprocess that I went through.\n\n375\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.640\nCuz I didn't actually add\na great deal of code,\n\n376\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.520\nit was more about how do I implement this?\n\n377\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.640\nAnd okay, where does this go?\n\n378\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.160\nHow do I do this?\n\n379\n00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.640\nI can put this here.\n\n380\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.670\nAnd then we're all good to go.\n\n381\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.560\nBut we're not gonna mess\nwith the logic now.\n\n382\n00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.280\n&gt;&gt; And it goes back to your\nreadme notes where you're saying,\n\n383\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.850\nhey, okay this is the order.\n\n384\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.030\nThis is why I did it.\n\n385\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.044\nWe haven't done the first bullet point yet\nnecessarily, or did we?\n\n386\n00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:22.104\n&gt;&gt; I think we might, well, that's not\nthe bullet point we're talking about,\n\n387\n00:21:22.104 --> 00:21:23.373\nprint the scoreboard.\n\n388\n00:21:23.373 --> 00:21:24.875\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We didn't do that first.\n\n389\n00:21:24.875 --> 00:21:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n390\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.290\n&gt;&gt; We did end up doing it.\n\n391\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.510\nBut I actually went here and\nsaid, I need to keep track.\n\n392\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.841\nWell, how am I gonna keep track,\n\n393\n00:21:30.841 --> 00:21:33.329\nbecause I can't print the scoreboard\nif I can't keep track.\n\n394\n00:21:33.329 --> 00:21:35.454\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, okay, and\nI realized that's the next episode.\n\n395\n00:21:35.454 --> 00:21:36.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.815\n&gt;&gt; I'm like I know we're gonna talk about\n\n397\n00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:44.598\ndoing something about losing, but I'm\ngetting ahead of us, so I was like damn.\n\n398\n00:21:44.598 --> 00:21:48.680\n&gt;&gt; I know Vonne, you were so\nexcited and I do appreciate that.\n\n399\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.470\nIt makes me feel good.\n\n400\n00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.180\nMakes my heart warm and fuzzy.\n\n401\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.830\nBut we're not gonna worry about winning or\nlosing,\n\n402\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.200\nbecause as it stands,\nthis is almost like a stop point.\n\n403\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.380\nIf we left this up,\n\n404\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.450\nwho decides who wins and\nlooses if we are playing this on paper?\n\n405\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.635\nYou and I, right?\n\n406\n00:22:02.635 --> 00:22:04.660\nWe go, you lost.\n\n407\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.607\nSo this is now greater feedback.\n\n408\n00:22:06.607 --> 00:22:10.245\nAnd you'll know if you lose,\neven if the program doesn't stop, right?\n\n409\n00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:14.122\nAnd we probably want to stop it and\n\n410\n00:22:14.122 --> 00:22:19.050\nshow that you lost or show that you won.\n\n411\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.420\nWe already actually did show that you win.\n\n412\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.190\nBut well we'll get there,\nwe'll probably have to tweak that,\n\n413\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.050\nbut we're not gonna do\nthat in this episode.\n\n414\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.644\n&gt;&gt; It's like you methodically think about\nhow to present this information and\n\n415\n00:22:31.644 --> 00:22:33.374\ngive us nice little chunks.\n\n416\n00:22:33.374 --> 00:22:37.615\nAnd do like, okay, so now we did this,\nokay let's marinate on this and think\n\n417\n00:22:37.615 --> 00:22:42.260\nabout it, and then move on to another\nfeature, which will be another episode.\n\n418\n00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.590\nAnd I just need to just cool,\nhold my horses back and\n\n419\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.370\ncool my jets and just wait for it.\n\n420\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.390\nBut again, I'm just having so\nmuch fun learning from this, so.\n\n421\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.240\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this up like you said.\n\n422\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.650\nAnd we'll be back with another episode.\n\n423\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.860\nSo signing off for DevPro.TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n424\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.770\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n425\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.621\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n426\n00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:05.836\n[SOUND]\n\n",

DEVPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:21.117\nI'm your show host, Vonne Smith, and we\nare moving through our applied fundamental\n\n4\n00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:22.790\nseries and with our hangman game.\n\n5\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.851\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ndetermining whether we win or\n\n6\n00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:29.373\nlose, which is something I really\nwanted to put in the last episode, but\n\n7\n00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:32.070\nluckily, to keep us on track is Mr.\nJustin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.317\nHow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic Vonne,\n\n9\n00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:36.240\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n10\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.738\nI'm trying to keep everything and\nthe scope of everything.\n\n11\n00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:41.100\nBut we did talk about,\nwe talked about this off camera.\n\n12\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.040\nWe did mention the whole,\nthe winning and the losing,\n\n13\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.570\nand we have to bring\nthe reality back into this.\n\n14\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.360\nI feel like it was just\nnaturally inclined,\n\n15\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.790\nthat I wanted to put it all together.\n\n16\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.506\nBut luckily, you keep us on track.\n\n17\n00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:54.901\nI know I'm supposed to\nbe keeping you on track.\n\n18\n00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:55.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:55.997 --> 00:00:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n20\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's nothing better than\n\n21\n00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.510\ntalking about the crushing reality of\nwinning and losing, and I can see how\n\n22\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.240\nyou want to make that reality of part\nof the game as soon as possible.\n\n23\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.940\nBut a little bit of preparation does make\nour life easier, well, here's hoping.\n\n24\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.720\nAnd what you may find during this\nseries is we have to backtrack some.\n\n25\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.670\nAnd I know in this episode, we're\nactually gonna backtrack some because of\n\n26\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.610\nsome naming choices that we've\nmade thus far, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.961\nSo in the last episode,\nwe keep track of incorrect guesses, and\n\n28\n00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.077\nwe report that to the user, and\nwhat I call the scoreboard.\n\n29\n00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:29.230\nNow, it's not flashy.\n\n30\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.434\nIt's not lit up.\n\n31\n00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:35.448\nIt's not a jumbotron or anything like\nthat, but it does give some feedback.\n\n32\n00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:38.807\nWe were actually talking about\nthis off camera as well.\n\n33\n00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:44.350\nThere's no worse game to lose at than\nthe game you don't know you're losing.\n\n34\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.970\nSo you're like, yeah, I'm doom.\n\n35\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.140\nLose, what a loser.\n\n36\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.690\nHe's been losing the whole time.\n\n37\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.750\nSo that's not what we wanted to do,\nthat's why we added that last part.\n\n38\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.940\nBut now, we need to figure out.\n\n39\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.880\nDid you win?\n\n40\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.890\nOr did you lose?\n\n41\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.710\nSo let's go and take a look at\nthe screen here, and I actually,\n\n42\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.970\nI have tried to reproduce as much as\npossible from the previous episode.\n\n43\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.710\nNot code wise, but\nI'm talking about positioning.\n\n44\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.730\nAll right, so if we go through here,\nI just wanna make a little bit of a plan.\n\n45\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.370\nWe are gonna make our little journal\nentry about what we're accomplishing for\n\n46\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.880\nthis respective piece.\n\n47\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.880\nBut if I look through here, there was\nsomething that we made a choice early on.\n\n48\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.710\nAnd by we, I did, and\ntold you to go along with it.\n\n49\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.530\nWe said has one right?\n\n50\n00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.382\nWell, that was when we\nwere winning all the time.\n\n51\n00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:35.960\nThat doesn't actually apply now.\n\n52\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.405\nHas won,\nwell actually while we're not done, right,\n\n53\n00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:44.536\nwhile we're not finished, is what we're\ndoing so we're either going to finish,\n\n54\n00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:48.307\nand we probably need to change\nthe logic here, a little bit.\n\n55\n00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:55.317\nSo we're probably gonna need to rename\nthat, but also if that's going to cut out,\n\n56\n00:02:55.317 --> 00:03:01.040\nwe're going to kinda repurpose has_won for\nadditional decision making.\n\n57\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.300\nCuz as this loop is running.\n\n58\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.700\nWhat we're doing is we're making\nguesses either to win or to lose right.\n\n59\n00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.600\nSo there we go, and here,\nwe've kinda hidden away some things.\n\n60\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.990\nThe computer has won wait for it.\n\n61\n00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.660\nSo this actually does some printing, which\nis a little bit harder to think about,\n\n62\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.290\na little harder to reason about\nbecause it is doing a couple of things\n\n63\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.150\nbecause it also returns true or\nturns false and does some printing.\n\n64\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.550\nSo we're gonna do some\nrestructuring there.\n\n65\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.700\nSo here's my thought.\n\n66\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.400\nWe need to make this a little clearer\nbecause it's now for win or lose.\n\n67\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.720\nWe need to run this while we're not done.\n\n68\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.026\nWell, one of the decisions we need to\nmake to determine whether the game is\n\n69\n00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:49.072\nfinished or not.\n\n70\n00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:52.269\nWhen the game does finish,\nwhen this main loop finishes,\n\n71\n00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.364\nthen one of two things have happened.\n\n72\n00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:57.820\nYou've either won or you'd lost.\n\n73\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.730\nRight?\n\n74\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.240\nSo if you've either won or lost, then we\nneed to make a quick couple of decisions\n\n75\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.140\nto either say hey,\nyou won, or hey, you lost.\n\n76\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.620\nSo we have to do some reorganization,\nand you're going to run into this.\n\n77\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.350\nI purposefully do these things and\n\n78\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.500\nI've actually made a comment about making\nsure a function doesn't do to many things.\n\n79\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.840\nSo this function actually\ndoes too many things.\n\n80\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.950\nIt not only does some print including the\nscreen and altering portions of our gain,\n\n81\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.480\nit also lets us know, hey,\nyou're either still running or you're not.\n\n82\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.550\nSo we need to tease that apart.\n\n83\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.210\nSo before we go that route let's\nmake a quick little entry here.\n\n84\n00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.360\nThis is 3/8/2017.\n\n85\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.690\nWe are going to determine.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n86\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.600\n&gt;&gt; What year are we in?\n\n87\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.870\n&gt;&gt; You know what we are doing Vonne.\n\n88\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.010\nYou know what I mean.\n\n89\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.548\nFlashback [LAUGH] I feel like\nwe should do here we go.\n\n90\n00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:55.335\nAnd then so we are good.\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n\n91\n00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:57.439\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE] Wayne's world.\n\n92\n00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.232\n&gt;&gt; So good.\n\n93\n00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:00.223\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we are going to, thank you so\n\n94\n00:05:00.223 --> 00:05:01.220\nmuch Vonne.\n\n95\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.920\nThere would have been egg on my face.\n\n96\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.276\nWe're going to determine\nwhether a player has\n\n97\n00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:13.083\nsuccessfully guessed\n\n98\n00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:17.536\nthe word in the Allotted.\n\n99\n00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:20.160\nI don't know if that spell it correctly.\n\n100\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.760\nRoll of text we'll see.\n\n101\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.863\nAllotted amount of guesses, so here we go.\n\n102\n00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:31.823\nAnd in order to do that we need to change\n\n103\n00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:36.473\nthe logic for the loop running, and\n\n104\n00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:41.901\nI'm gonna put in parenthesis, has won.\n\n105\n00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:43.418\nThat's not going to work.\n\n106\n00:05:44.746 --> 00:05:50.076\nAnd then,\nwe need to after the game has ended,\n\n107\n00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:58.167\nThen if you won, yay.\n\n108\n00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:01.107\nIf you lost,\n&gt;&gt; Boo\n\n109\n00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:02.848\n&gt;&gt; Boo right.\n\n110\n00:06:02.848 --> 00:06:04.062\n&gt;&gt; So there we go.\n\n111\n00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:08.895\nNow, this is a little bit pseudo-codish\nbecause there's a lot more to do then to\n\n112\n00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:10.770\nget this to work.\n\n113\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.130\nThis first one,\nI think we need to address this one, and\n\n114\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.190\nI did say in the previous episode\nsometimes these are not necessarily\n\n115\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.750\nalways addressed in the order\nthat they're listed.\n\n116\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.940\nBut looking at this, in order to determine\nwhether we're done or not, right?\n\n117\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.180\nWhether the game is still running.\n\n118\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.970\nWe probably need to\nchange this logic okay?\n\n119\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.310\nSo we're going to hijack that, and I'm\nthinking we're going to leave this alone\n\n120\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.030\nand I'm going to write a new function and\nwe may end up deleting things.\n\n121\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.310\nSo I'm going to call it done, and I'm\ngoing to say return false just for now.\n\n122\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.650\nSo we are going to change this out.\n\n123\n00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.940\nI am going to cut this and\nsay while not done like that.\n\n124\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.630\nOkay, so this is going to call\nthat function every time.\n\n125\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.914\nAnd let's see if that's still working.\n\n126\n00:07:01.914 --> 00:07:07.435\nAnd, Yeah, yeah.\n\n127\n00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:09.191\nSo we're good to go, right?\n\n128\n00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:13.670\nNow, ok, we're going negative.\n\n129\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.820\nAnd I actually just, yeah, there we go.\n\n130\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.880\nI was like wait a minute,\nthere was, it glitched out on me.\n\n131\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.970\nIt was my mind playing tricks on me.\n\n132\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.280\nThe not done or the done function\nis actually serving its purpose.\n\n133\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.580\nWhat I am thinking is this done it's\ngoing to take state of our application,\n\n134\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.390\nand return true or\nfalse depending on, well,\n\n135\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.240\nwhether the game is finished, alright.\n\n136\n00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:47.200\nThat has won we're leaving that\nbecause that maybe helpful so\n\n137\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200\nhere is what I'm thinking.\n\n138\n00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.499\nSo done.\n\n139\n00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:52.865\nWell, if you take the selected word and\n\n140\n00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:58.893\nthe letters of the selected word and\nthe number of incorrect guesses.\n\n141\n00:07:58.893 --> 00:08:02.888\nThose are all the determined whether our\ngame is still running or not, right?\n\n142\n00:08:02.888 --> 00:08:06.680\nSo we're gonna come back up here and\nchange that, and say selected_word,\n\n143\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.302\nletters_of_selected_word, just reason as\nvariable names in the context to function,\n\n144\n00:08:11.302 --> 00:08:12.670\nI don't have to do that.\n\n145\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.289\nI do that because to me it\nreduces the cognitive load.\n\n146\n00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:18.234\nWell, what does this do?\n\n147\n00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:19.670\nI don't have to do mappings.\n\n148\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.460\nI don't always do this,\nas you've seen in other functions, but\n\n149\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.650\na lot of times I will,\nespecially if they're meaningful.\n\n150\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.230\nAnd then a number_of_incorrect_guesses.\n\n151\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.390\nSo what determines done?\n\n152\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.242\nWell, if selected_word, or wait a minute.\n\n153\n00:08:37.242 --> 00:08:39.000\nWait for it.\n\n154\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.760\nIf None is not in\nletters_of_selected_word: Right?\n\n155\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:53.048\nSo if none's not there,\nthen we're done, return True, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:54.305\nLet's think about that.\n\n157\n00:08:54.305 --> 00:09:00.143\nIf I no longer have nones\nin this list then I'm done,\n\n158\n00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:04.400\nand I actually need to remove that is.\n\n159\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.612\nThat was a typo on my part.\n\n160\n00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:09.820\nAll right, but\nwhat if there are nones there?\n\n161\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.030\nWhat's the next check?\n\n162\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:17.155\nIf the number_of_Incorrect_guesses &gt;==\n\n163\n00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:22.780\nTOTAL_GUESSES_ALLOWED: then\nwe're also done.\n\n164\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.500\nAll right, so\n\n165\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.210\nif I eclipsed the number of guesses\nthat I can have, then I'm finished.\n\n166\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.763\nAll right,\nare there any other ones that I need?\n\n167\n00:09:33.763 --> 00:09:34.792\nWell, let's see here.\n\n168\n00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:39.072\nReturn, actually, I don't think there is.\n\n169\n00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:40.300\nThose are our two end conditions.\n\n170\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.496\nYou either went past your number of\nguesses, or you've guessed the word.\n\n171\n00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:44.540\nIt's kind of a binary thing.\n\n172\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.130\nSo, I'm gonna return False as the default.\n\n173\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.430\nBut you'll notice here, I made a plan and\n\n174\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.950\nI thought I needed something\nthat I don't actually need.\n\n175\n00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.362\nThis one right here.\n\n176\n00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.220\nI don't need selected_word.\n\n177\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.050\nI didn't use it anywhere in here.\n\n178\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.160\nSo don't pass arguments to\nfunctions you don't need.\n\n179\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.040\nSo we're just gonna take that out, and as\na result we're gonna come down here, and\n\n180\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.796\nremove it from done right here.\n\n181\n00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:14.986\nSo done(letter_of_selected_word,\nnumber_of_incorrect_guesses):,\n\n182\n00:10:14.986 --> 00:10:19.163\nand makes a determination of whether\nwe're still playing the game or\n\n183\n00:10:19.163 --> 00:10:22.906\nan end condition has been reached.\n&gt;&gt; Now you did say that,\n\n184\n00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:28.950\ndon't put variables that don't need to be\npassed, but is it really bad if you do?\n\n185\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.806\nWill it make a huge,\nis it gonna break the game?\n\n186\n00:10:33.806 --> 00:10:35.133\n&gt;&gt; It will not break the game, but\n\n187\n00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:38.403\nwhat'll happen is you'll come back\nto this months later, and you'll go,\n\n188\n00:10:38.403 --> 00:10:40.055\nwhy did I pass that variable in there?\n\n189\n00:10:40.055 --> 00:10:45.136\nIt actually makes it more difficult\nto reason about, because you're like,\n\n190\n00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:49.044\nwell, why is that parameter\nbeing passed to the function,\n\n191\n00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:54.205\nwhen it's not being used, and\nI've actually seen functions that have 30,\n\n192\n00:10:54.205 --> 00:10:59.000\n40, 50 parameters, and then you go,\nwe only used like six of them.\n\n193\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.276\nSo I'm like searching out what\nare these other 36 parameters doing?\n\n194\n00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:07.050\nAnd they're like, well that was\njust in case I needed them later.\n\n195\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.590\nDon't do that.\n\n196\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.447\nOnly pass what you need at the time.\n\n197\n00:11:11.447 --> 00:11:14.983\nIt keeps things cleaner,\nit makes it easier to reason about, and\n\n198\n00:11:14.983 --> 00:11:18.216\nit will keep you from like\ncreating bad habits, all right.\n\n199\n00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:20.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's not a make or\n\n200\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.128\nbreak in the language itself,\nit's just like you said,\n\n201\n00:11:24.128 --> 00:11:25.679\ngood practice,-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n202\n00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:27.061\n&gt;&gt; And you wanna be a good coder,\n\n203\n00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.730\nyou don't wanna be a sloppy coder.\n\n204\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.440\nSo you don't do that.\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that and\n\n205\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.760\nit'll just make your life easier as well.\n\n206\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.320\nI tend to be a lazy individual as much as\nI can, and if I don't have to think too\n\n207\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.460\nhard, I'm not going to.\n&gt;&gt; We call that efficiency,\n\n208\n00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.490\nnot lazy, efficiency.\n&gt;&gt; You know, tomato, tomato,\n\n209\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.860\nbut, let's see if,\nwe've actually changed a function.\n\n210\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.512\nWe've re, kind of redone our logic there.\n\n211\n00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:55.130\nLet's see if that changes\nthe dynamic of the game.\n\n212\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.730\nIt should, because now we have\ntwo different done states.\n\n213\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.399\nWe're not gonna see win or lose,\ncuz we haven't addressed that yet, but\n\n214\n00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:05.959\nwe come back here and\nwe say python3 main.py, right?\n\n215\n00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:10.530\nI'm gonna say a, a, a,\na and then that's it.\n\n216\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.627\nI lost, I had zero guess left.\n\n217\n00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:18.687\nI did five incorrect guesses.\n&gt;&gt; It did the return,\n\n218\n00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:20.790\nwell,-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n219\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.311\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did it.\n\n220\n00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:21.986\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n221\n00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:26.055\nit had the correct logic if I guessed\nincorrectly, so I guessed incorrectly\n\n222\n00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:29.355\nintentionally five times.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it met one of those if statements.\n\n223\n00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:31.454\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and so it returned true for don,\n\n224\n00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:33.290\nand then that loop finished, and\n\n225\n00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.240\nthe game ended.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz return false was if these weren't\n\n226\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.917\nmet.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n227\n00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:37.921\n&gt;&gt; Okay, got it.\n\n228\n00:12:37.921 --> 00:12:39.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's see if I can win.\n\n229\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:45.305\nWin, so a, so if there's no,\nthat has be to cheese,\n\n230\n00:12:45.305 --> 00:12:52.500\nand that also terminates,\nwhich is actually our win condition.\n\n231\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.820\nThat's good.\n\n232\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.070\nSo we're breaking out of the loop, and\nnow we have the capability of going,\n\n233\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.480\nokay, well now if I've won, do this.\n\n234\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.441\nNow if I've lost, do this other thing,\n\n235\n00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:09.198\nand that's the end of the game,\nand the game ends.\n\n236\n00:13:09.198 --> 00:13:13.117\nSo, this is a refactor.\n\n237\n00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:14.230\nWe changed the logic here.\n\n238\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.731\nWe actually made it simpler because\ndone is doing less than has_won,\n\n239\n00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:25.112\nhas_won is also printing out stuff and\nall these other things.\n\n240\n00:13:25.112 --> 00:13:28.400\nSo has_won,\n\n241\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.950\nnotice I passed in selected_word,\nbecause I used it here as a print?\n\n242\n00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.800\nYou know what?\n\n243\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.971\nI don't think has_won actually needs that,\nbecause what I'm thinking,\n\n244\n00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:42.624\nwe're originally using this for\nalso loop control.\n\n245\n00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:45.615\nI'm going to commandeer this.\n\n246\n00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:48.123\nI'm gonna commandeer this\nto say if I have_won,\n\n247\n00:13:48.123 --> 00:13:52.200\nI'm actually gonna change it to have_won\nsince saying has makes me feel weird.\n\n248\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.011\nIf I have_won the only thing I need\nto determine to see if I've won is\n\n249\n00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:58.810\nthe letters_of_select_word.\n\n250\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.650\nI'm also gong to have have_lost, right, so\n\n251\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.530\nI'm changing this around, and\nhow do I know if I've lost?\n\n252\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.430\nWell, a termination is completed by done,\n\n253\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.440\nthis should actually be skipped\nif there are nones in there.\n\n254\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.172\nSo then I'm thinking we'll\ncheck to see if I've lost.\n\n255\n00:14:23.172 --> 00:14:29.164\nWell have_lost, all I need is\nthe number_of_incorrect_guesses.\n\n256\n00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:33.369\nSo if I come here we're just gonna put\na pass there, and what pass does is say,\n\n257\n00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:37.270\nwell you have a function, but\nthere's nothing inside of it right now.\n\n258\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.461\nWe're just gonna pass on\nthe implementation details.\n\n259\n00:14:40.461 --> 00:14:45.970\nOkay, so I can see Vonne kind of going,\nall right, I get what you're doing here.\n\n260\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.526\nI'm not real sure how this is gonna\ncome together, but if we go back,\n\n261\n00:14:50.526 --> 00:14:54.546\nI'm essentially addressing\nthese last two bullet points.\n\n262\n00:14:54.546 --> 00:14:56.650\nSo we change the logic for\nthe loop running.\n\n263\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.070\nThe loop now terminates based\non whether the game's over or\n\n264\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.810\nnot, and then we're gonna say,\nwell, if you won, yay.\n\n265\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.875\nIf you've lost, boo.\n\n266\n00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:07.893\nSo that's the point\nwe're working with now.\n\n267\n00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm following,\n\n268\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:14.104\nand I'm like, okay, and I'm just gonna\nwait for it to be the like, yep,\n\n269\n00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:16.382\nthat's what you mean, cuz I'm like,\n\n270\n00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:21.103\nI know you're gonna kinda pull something\nout of there, and put something down.\n\n271\n00:15:21.103 --> 00:15:25.070\nI'm gonna let you try.\n&gt;&gt; It's about to be a grand reveal Vonne.\n\n272\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:30.157\nSo if you stay with me when this\nloop terminates then we have either,\n\n273\n00:15:30.157 --> 00:15:35.430\nso if we have_won and\nthat takes the letters_of_selected_word,\n\n274\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.136\nif we have_won, then something.\n\n275\n00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:43.627\nSo print('win') and if we have_lost and\n\n276\n00:15:43.627 --> 00:15:50.564\nthat takes\nthe (number_of_incorrect_guesses),\n\n277\n00:15:50.564 --> 00:15:53.894\nthen print('lose').\n\n278\n00:15:53.894 --> 00:15:57.314\nRight, so I'm gonna come back and\naddress those shortly.\n\n279\n00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:00.390\nBut this is different on every game,\neverything you make.\n\n280\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.549\nThis works for this particular case and\nthat's the logic rounded.\n\n281\n00:16:03.549 --> 00:16:07.572\nWhen the game ends, there's one of\ntwo possible things that will happen.\n\n282\n00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:12.556\nYou either guessed the letters and\nthat's what determines if you win, and\n\n283\n00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:15.103\nif that is not true then you have lost.\n\n284\n00:16:15.103 --> 00:16:21.519\nOne could argue that I could just make\nthis an else, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n285\n00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:24.841\nSo, if you haven't won,\nthen you have lost.\n\n286\n00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:28.391\nBut I'm gonna put some explicit\nbehavior here just to say,\n\n287\n00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:31.454\nwell losing is dependent\non the number of guesses.\n\n288\n00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:37.258\nAnd I only check if you've lost if\nthe have one doesn't get down there,\n\n289\n00:16:37.258 --> 00:16:38.238\nall right?\n\n290\n00:16:38.238 --> 00:16:43.861\nSo let's actually implement these,\nand these actually become very simple.\n\n291\n00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:45.761\nI'm going to cut that out.\n\n292\n00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:48.665\nI'm gonna delete that, and\n\n293\n00:16:48.665 --> 00:16:53.508\nI'm just gonna return here,\nand delete that.\n\n294\n00:16:53.508 --> 00:16:57.874\nThat function got way simpler,\nand a lot easier to reason about.\n\n295\n00:16:57.874 --> 00:17:00.555\nSo I'm essentially making an alias.\n\n296\n00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:06.004\nBut before I forget I am\ngoing to paste that there and\n\n297\n00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:09.053\nput a hashtag or an.\n\n298\n00:17:09.053 --> 00:17:10.511\nThose are fun to say.\n\n299\n00:17:10.511 --> 00:17:14.836\nIn front so it's not executed but\nI am going to keep that code for,\n\n300\n00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:17.208\ncuz I know it's going to come back.\n\n301\n00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:18.626\nSo here we go.\n\n302\n00:17:18.626 --> 00:17:21.760\nWe come back up here,\nI need to implement has lost.\n\n303\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.201\nHow do I determine if you've lost?\n\n304\n00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:32.212\nWell, return that the number of incorrect\nguesses is greater than or equal to, well,\n\n305\n00:17:32.212 --> 00:17:37.327\nwhat is it the total of guesses allowed?\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that,\n\n306\n00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:40.510\nbut I was scared I was gonna be wrong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.840\n&gt;&gt; But no, that's the total number\n\n308\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.368\nof guesses.\n\n309\n00:17:42.368 --> 00:17:46.329\nWe've talked about that.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is what we have done here.\n\n310\n00:17:46.329 --> 00:17:49.482\nAnd you'll notice this done.\n\n311\n00:17:49.482 --> 00:17:51.208\nLook at that.\n\n312\n00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:51.855\nNot none.\n\n313\n00:17:51.855 --> 00:17:53.902\nSee how that's repeated?\n\n314\n00:17:53.902 --> 00:17:56.149\nSee how that is repeated as well?\n\n315\n00:17:56.149 --> 00:18:00.326\nWell, when are we done,\nwe either won or lost, so-\n\n316\n00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:02.748\n&gt;&gt; Now you're gonna put that has won and\n\n317\n00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:06.357\nhas lost in there because\nyou've already defined it.\n\n318\n00:18:06.357 --> 00:18:06.879\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\n\n319\n00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:10.013\nI'm actually gonna go ahead and\nchange this to have won,\n\n320\n00:18:10.013 --> 00:18:13.624\nhave won because I said I was gonna\ndo that and I will try to do that.\n\n321\n00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:15.419\nSo letters of a selected word.\n\n322\n00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:18.766\nAnd you have to be careful here, don't get\ncrazy with calling functions inside of\n\n323\n00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:22.423\nfunctions inside of functions because now\nyou're adding another layer of complexity.\n\n324\n00:18:22.423 --> 00:18:26.676\nIf this isn't really simple I have to now\ngo to have one reason about what have one\n\n325\n00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:29.677\nis doing, then come back and\nfinish this function out.\n\n326\n00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:35.860\nSo this is a little dash as long as\nthe functions are small, you're all right.\n\n327\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.107\nIf they're not, then just be explicit,\nkeep it like it was, all right?\n\n328\n00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:47.056\nSo have lost and\nthe number of incorrect guesses.\n\n329\n00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:50.037\nSo we're done when one of these is true,\nright?\n\n330\n00:18:50.037 --> 00:18:52.595\nOtherwise we're not.\n\n331\n00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:53.951\nSo, I have all of these.\n\n332\n00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:55.418\nI'm gonna come down here and change these.\n\n333\n00:18:55.418 --> 00:18:57.712\nWell, I've already changed the have one.\n\n334\n00:18:57.712 --> 00:18:59.171\nI changed a few things.\n\n335\n00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:01.704\nLet's see if this plays out for me.\n\n336\n00:19:01.704 --> 00:19:02.472\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:04.904\nPython three main.\n\n338\n00:19:04.904 --> 00:19:05.950\nAll right, so A.\n\n339\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.393\nAh-ah, I know what that is.\n\n340\n00:19:08.393 --> 00:19:11.473\nLet's go ahead and try our win condition.\n\n341\n00:19:11.473 --> 00:19:13.579\nI won, yay!\n\n342\n00:19:13.579 --> 00:19:15.370\nAll right?\n\n343\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.636\nWell we got some weird UI stuff,\nbut that's all right.\n\n344\n00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:24.872\nPython 3 main, and\nI'm gonna say a, so that's orange,\n\n345\n00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:29.727\nso I'm going to say f,\nf, f, f, and I lose.\n\n346\n00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:33.014\nA game has a winner and\na loser, it works now.\n\n347\n00:19:33.014 --> 00:19:35.960\nI don't like how this gonna plays in.\n\n348\n00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.342\nDuring the simplification of [have\none I lost some of the pretty,\n\n349\n00:19:41.342 --> 00:19:45.102\nbut I'm just going to\ngrab my pretty red here.\n\n350\n00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:51.013\nThat was definitely a wizard of Oz moment,\nso I'm gonna do that.\n\n351\n00:19:51.013 --> 00:19:54.181\nI'm gonna say, clear screen,\nprint to top margin and print.\n\n352\n00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:55.856\nYou have won.\n\n353\n00:19:55.856 --> 00:20:00.297\nLikewise, I'm going to clear the screen,\n\n354\n00:20:00.297 --> 00:20:04.267\nprint to top margin and print you lose.\n\n355\n00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:10.656\nUnfortunately, You have not guessed.\n\n356\n00:20:10.656 --> 00:20:13.627\nWow, guessed the word and\n\n357\n00:20:13.627 --> 00:20:19.717\nlet's just put this as selected_word,\nall right?\n\n358\n00:20:19.717 --> 00:20:21.360\nSo, we're good.\n&gt;&gt; You're so very nice on that-\n\n359\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:20:23.147 --> 00:20:24.140\n&gt;&gt; Lose statement, like nope.\n\n361\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:24.994\n&gt;&gt; Well you know,\n\n362\n00:20:24.994 --> 00:20:27.779\nthis is family-oriented television.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:29.917\n&gt;&gt; So, let's play our game now.\n\n364\n00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:34.399\nAnd if I say a,\nthat's orange, so f, f, f, f.\n\n365\n00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:37.872\nUnfortunately, you have not\nguessed the word, orange.\n\n366\n00:20:37.872 --> 00:20:39.585\nThat's not good.\n\n367\n00:20:39.585 --> 00:20:42.342\nAnd then, let's try to win it.\n\n368\n00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:43.794\nLet's say, a.\n\n369\n00:20:43.794 --> 00:20:44.690\nWell, that's apple.\n\n370\n00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:50.726\nAnd congratulations,\nyou won with the word apple.\n\n371\n00:20:50.726 --> 00:20:53.403\nJust a quick aside,\nI'm actually putting commas here so\n\n372\n00:20:53.403 --> 00:20:54.811\nit kind of just puts a string.\n\n373\n00:20:54.811 --> 00:20:58.395\nI could do the same thing that I've\ndone and use a four-match string.\n\n374\n00:20:58.395 --> 00:21:01.454\nThis is just to demonstrate a couple\nof different aspects to the language.\n\n375\n00:21:01.454 --> 00:21:04.249\nMany ways to do the same thing.\n\n376\n00:21:04.249 --> 00:21:08.361\nAnd most of you,\nme included on first pass I would say we,\n\n377\n00:21:08.361 --> 00:21:10.346\nthis is I am gonna leave it.\n\n378\n00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:11.750\nI am gonna let it marinate.\n\n379\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.238\nThere is one final thing.\n\n380\n00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:16.966\nI have an if statement and\nI have a if statement, and\n\n381\n00:21:16.966 --> 00:21:19.409\nthere's nothing else after it.\n\n382\n00:21:19.409 --> 00:21:21.645\nIf I look here,\nclear screen, clear screen.\n\n383\n00:21:21.645 --> 00:21:23.109\nPrint top margin, print top margin.\n\n384\n00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:24.867\nThose are repeated.\n\n385\n00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.510\nSo I'm gonna pull these out.\n\n386\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.402\nThese should always happen\nwhether I've won or lost.\n\n387\n00:21:31.402 --> 00:21:34.832\nSo I'm gonna pull those out,\nand pull that out,\n\n388\n00:21:34.832 --> 00:21:38.859\nto above because those\nare the first things that happen.\n\n389\n00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:44.463\nSo I pulled them above and\nI reduced the duplicate lines of code.\n\n390\n00:21:44.463 --> 00:21:47.195\nIf you didn't catch that,\nthat's perfectly okay.\n\n391\n00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:50.594\nLet's see, here we go Vonne,\ncross your fingers.\n\n392\n00:21:50.594 --> 00:21:56.624\nAnd a and b, and n, and congratulations\nyou won with the word banana.\n\n393\n00:21:56.624 --> 00:21:58.282\nOne more time for us.\n\n394\n00:21:58.282 --> 00:22:03.923\nAnd that's, let's see, a,\nthat's orange so f, f, f, f, f.\n\n395\n00:22:03.923 --> 00:22:06.980\nUnfortunately you have not\nguessed the word orange.\n\n396\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.792\nSo our game actually has a winner and\na loser scoreboard.\n\n397\n00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:14.863\nI think now is a good time to think\nabout the changes we've made because\n\n398\n00:22:14.863 --> 00:22:18.244\nwe didn't add a lot of code but\nwe did take away some code and\n\n399\n00:22:18.244 --> 00:22:21.852\ndid some additional refactoring like here,\nI'll have won.\n\n400\n00:22:21.852 --> 00:22:26.183\nWhen I'm I done, I either won or\nI lost otherwise I'm not done.\n\n401\n00:22:26.183 --> 00:22:28.687\nWell, these functions are small and\n\n402\n00:22:28.687 --> 00:22:32.982\nthen I use them to print messages\nafter the game loop has ended.\n\n403\n00:22:32.982 --> 00:22:39.403\nAnd well, think about this, let this veg,\nsee if all of this logic makes sense.\n\n404\n00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:44.010\nAnd well, there's one final thing we need\na little snasification for this, but\n\n405\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.091\nwe're not gonna do that in this episode.\n&gt;&gt; You're leaving\n\n406\n00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:50.505\nus with a cliffhanger again because I'm\nfeeling this is a pretty fun little game.\n\n407\n00:22:50.505 --> 00:22:54.731\nYou extend out our word list to\nwhere I don't know it's cheese,\n\n408\n00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:56.620\napple, orange and banana.\n\n409\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.188\n[LAUGH] Can't even remember\nthose four anyways.\n\n410\n00:22:59.188 --> 00:22:59.960\nBut that's fun.\n\n411\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.741\nSo we do have a little bit more.\n\n412\n00:23:01.741 --> 00:23:05.799\nAnd okay, well then I will stay here and\nbe very patient,\n\n413\n00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:09.874\neven though I'm very excited\nof what's coming up next.\n\n414\n00:23:09.874 --> 00:23:10.761\nAll right, well, that's cool.\n\n415\n00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:12.229\nLet's go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n416\n00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:13.949\nSigning off at DevPro TV.\n\n417\n00:23:13.949 --> 00:23:16.247\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n418\n00:23:16.247 --> 00:23:18.162\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

exciting\nexciting edition of DevProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.147\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n5\n00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:22.095\nAnd we're moving through our\nLive Fundamentals Hangman Series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.195\nAnd in this episode we're\ngoing to be printing banners.\n\n7\n00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:29.145\nAnd here to print all sorts of knowledge\non my brain is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:30.905\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Vonne,\n\n9\n00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.435\nhow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing very good.\n\n10\n00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.645\nI'm kind of excited to\nsee where we're going.\n\n11\n00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:40.410\nI mean I feel that this is the last one,\nour last step to kind of finalize and\n\n12\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.990\nput just the bow on the present.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n13\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.380\nI have an ulterior motive here as well.\n\n14\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.900\nYou're right.\nThis is the last one.\n\n15\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.779\nAnd if someone was like,\nthat's kind of underwhelming,\n\n16\n00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.025\nyou'd just say congratulations or uh-oh.\n\n17\n00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:55.460\nIt should be a little more, right?\n\n18\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.572\nSo we're actually gonna do that.\n\n19\n00:00:56.572 --> 00:01:01.580\nBut at the end of that I have a few\nchallenges to issue about how to add onto\n\n20\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.720\nthis that will help you really cement\nwhat we built during this series.\n\n21\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so like when we win,\n\n22\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.754\nwe want something like rainbows and\nsome dancing bears happening there or\n\n23\n00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:10.999\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n24\n00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.345\nI'm gonna need you to\ntemper your expectations.\n\n25\n00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:17.868\nI'm thinking instead of a single sentence,\nmaybe some ASCII art or just like\n\n26\n00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:22.480\nan actual banner that is outlined that\nsays, hey winner, congratulations.\n\n27\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.600\nIt would be awesome, to have like\nfireworks, and maybe pyrotechnics and\n\n28\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.570\nthings like that.\n\n29\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.590\nYou know what?\nI was thinking,\n\n30\n00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.843\nit would take an exorbitant\namount of time.\n\n31\n00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:37.523\nBut I think I could probably get an ASCII\nart explosion to animate on the terminal.\n\n32\n00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:39.560\nBut maybe that's another project.\n\n33\n00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.250\nSo that is all right.\n\n34\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.350\nSo let's go out and\ntake a look at the screen, and\n\n35\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.570\nsee what I'm talking about here.\n\n36\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.121\nWe have all of this code.\n\n37\n00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:52.776\nIt actually over the last few episodes it\nended up being a whole bunch code, right?\n\n38\n00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:58.203\nAnd well, we are more less finished\nexcept here if you've won,\n\n39\n00:01:58.203 --> 00:02:01.980\nit says congratulations, you won.\n\n40\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.957\nI mean there is an exclamation\npoint there but, I don't know.\n\n41\n00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:09.427\nIt just, kind of and it says unfortunately\nyou have not guessed the word and\n\n42\n00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:10.710\nthen the word.\n\n43\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.518\nAnd if we come back over here and\nlook, python3 main.py.\n\n44\n00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.193\nAnd let's see, a?\n\n45\n00:02:17.193 --> 00:02:21.884\nNo, there's no a there so\nit has to be cheese.\n\n46\n00:02:21.884 --> 00:02:24.150\nAnd it says, congratulations, you won.\n\n47\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.660\nThis seems really underwhelming.\n\n48\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.160\nI got called out on it, Vonne.\n\n49\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.969\nSo I decided to maybe\njust add a few tweaks.\n\n50\n00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:36.480\nBut I'm also here to\nchallenge you as well.\n\n51\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.520\nNow let's see here, an A.\n\n52\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.470\nOkay, we know that's Apple so\nI'm gonna say r r r r r.\n\n53\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.260\nAnd you have not guessed the word apple.\n\n54\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.460\nWhat I'm thinking is instead\nof immediately ending\n\n55\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.625\nis clear the screen and\nmaybe just print like a big old\n\n56\n00:02:54.625 --> 00:03:00.810\nASCII border that's like win with the\nappropriate amount of exclamation points,\n\n57\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.590\nlike, I don't know, four,\nor something like that.\n\n58\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.550\nAnd then you have guessed the word,\nApple, and in addition to for lose.\n\n59\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.770\nUnfortunately, you did not\nguess the word blah blah blah.\n\n60\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.680\nWe are probably going to put\na lose in there somewhere.\n\n61\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.350\nYou really got to drive at home.\n\n62\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.360\nSo, that's what I'm planning on doing for\nthis last final feature push.\n\n63\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're still a little too nice,\n\n64\n00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:28.540\nunfortunately, I'm so sorry.\n\n65\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.642\nNo, we wanna say, loser.\n&gt;&gt; Loser.\n\n66\n00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:32.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, bye, not today.\n\n67\n00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:34.709\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go with loser.\n\n68\n00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.148\nWe'll go with loser.\n\n69\n00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:38.638\nBut let's think about\nwhere this needs to go.\n\n70\n00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:44.000\nAnd let's just make sure that we have\na plan that we can enact, right?\n\n71\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.929\nSo 2018 [LAUGH].\n\n72\n00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:54.315\nCreate a more I don't know,\n\n73\n00:03:55.691 --> 00:04:00.410\nA more substantial banner,\na more substantial win message.\n\n74\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.920\nAnd let everyone actually\nwe'll just stay with it.\n\n75\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.007\nCreate a more substantial, Lose message,\n\n76\n00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:12.731\nright?\n&gt;&gt; You gonna say let everyone know that\n\n77\n00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.401\nyou lost horribly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n78\n00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:18.120\n[LAUGH] yeah,\nlet everybody know that you were a loser.\n\n79\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.870\nSo those are our two tasks.\n\n80\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.280\nIf we come back here and we think\nabout where we could put these, well,\n\n81\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.770\nit really makes sense to\nhave these print here.\n\n82\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.500\nBut instead of them merely exiting\nthe game, I'm also thinking about saying\n\n83\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.660\npress any key to finish or\nsomething of that nature, right?\n\n84\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.587\nSo, here is what I'm thinking.\n\n85\n00:04:36.587 --> 00:04:42.640\nReally all of our logic needs to\ngo here and then let's see here.\n\n86\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.410\nLet's get that wait, that wait, right?\n\n87\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.296\nSo how about we just say an input Press\n\n88\n00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:58.040\nany key to end the game.\n\n89\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.795\nAnd then we'll do\nthe exact same thing here.\n\n90\n00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:02.650\nAnd you'll notice I'm copying and pasting.\n\n91\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.860\nThat should throw up a red flag for you.\n\n92\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.620\nBut if we come back and we see how\nthis works out, then A, wait for it.\n\n93\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.881\nThen it has to be cheese.\n\n94\n00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.460\nAnd then it just kinda hangs out.\n\n95\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.948\nIt doesn't bring our prompt back.\n\n96\n00:05:19.948 --> 00:05:23.110\nAnd then [NOISE], and\nnow the game is finished.\n\n97\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.060\nSo that adds a little bit nicer portion.\n\n98\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.590\nWe'll probably go above and\n\n99\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.776\nbeyond with that.\n&gt;&gt; This reminds me of one of those silly\n\n100\n00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:35.168\ncomputer jokes about like,\nwhere's the Any key?\n\n101\n00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Aw.\n\n102\n00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:36.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:36.644 --> 00:05:38.530\n&gt;&gt; You are silly.\n\n104\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.847\nYou are silly.\nBut I guess I shouldn't say that,\n\n105\n00:05:40.847 --> 00:05:43.910\ncuz who knows what kinda\nsilliness I'm gonna do here.\n\n106\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.900\nAll right, so we have that.\n\n107\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.560\nAnd I'm thinking that maybe\nwe can clear the screen again\n\n108\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.680\nbefore exiting the game, right?\n\n109\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.560\nSo clear the screen.\n\n110\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.450\nAnd that way it actually comes back\nto the top, clears everything out.\n\n111\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.104\nAnd then I'm gonna clear\nthe screen here as well.\n\n112\n00:06:03.104 --> 00:06:08.745\nSo clear_screen, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:10.600\nPut a semicolon in there.\n\n114\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.934\nSo here we go, a is banana, all right?\n\n115\n00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:18.230\nAnd then it all kind of\ncleans up after itself.\n\n116\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.760\nThese are minor changes, but it is a\nlittle nicer experience, at least for me.\n\n117\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.890\nAs nice as you can get in the Terminal.\n\n118\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.260\nYou'll notice I got some repetition here.\n\n119\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.800\nWe'll address that shortly,\nso don't worry.\n\n120\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.110\nBut for now,\nwe're gonna leave those there.\n\n121\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.754\nNow instead of saying, print,\ncongratulations, you won the word,\n\n122\n00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:38.430\nI think those are probably\nbetter to be functions.\n\n123\n00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.830\nAnd I'm gonna build these as functions.\n\n124\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.860\nPrint the win banner.\n\n125\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.170\nAnd what information do I need to know?\n\n126\n00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.081\nI just need to know a selected\nword that goes in there.\n\n127\n00:06:52.081 --> 00:06:55.890\nI like my editor,\nit's sometimes too helpful.\n\n128\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.700\nThere we go.\n\n129\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.075\nThen I'm going to print the lose banner.\n\n130\n00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:04.460\nAnd that's going to a pass as well.\n\n131\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.593\nSo I know I'm going to tell\nthem what the word is.\n\n132\n00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.042\nSo I'm putting the word in as an argument.\n\n133\n00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:14.060\nAnd for now we are just going to go cut.\n\n134\n00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.200\nAnd that was Cmd+Shift.\n\n135\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.690\nAnd I hit the right key.\n\n136\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.857\nAnd that will actually go to\nthe end of the line and highlight.\n\n137\n00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:26.870\nAnd then Cmd+X will cut it.\n\n138\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:34.774\nAnd then here I am going to grab this and\ncut.\n\n139\n00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:37.222\nAnd there we are.\n\n140\n00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:47.190\nAnd now we can say print_win_banner.\n\n141\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.491\nAnd we pass in selected_word.\n\n142\n00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:54.878\nAnd then we're gonna print the win or\nthe lose banner or letters or blanks.\n\n143\n00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:56.372\nThat will also work as well.\n\n144\n00:07:56.372 --> 00:07:57.246\nNo, it will not.\n\n145\n00:07:57.246 --> 00:08:00.381\nThere we go, selected_word, okay.\n\n146\n00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.238\nSo, we're waiting here.\n\n147\n00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:03.109\nWe're good.\n\n148\n00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:04.212\nAnd that's all nice.\n\n149\n00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:05.790\nAnd, you know what?\n\n150\n00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.354\nI'm thinking that we'll probably\nstill print a top margin.\n\n151\n00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:17.030\nI think we've already\ngot the top margin here.\n\n152\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.970\nWe're gonna keep that.\n\n153\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.220\nSo, let's see if everything\nstill works all right,\n\n154\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.790\nbecause then we can actually get\na little down to business here.\n\n155\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:31.054\nSo a, that's an orange, that messed up.\n\n156\n00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:33.900\nAnd congratulations you\nwon with the word orange.\n\n157\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.915\nEverything still works the same I've\njust extracted those to a function.\n\n158\n00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.950\nLets play one more time and lose.\n\n159\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.220\nAll right, unfortunately you have\nnot guessed the word, orange, again.\n\n160\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.640\nSo hit enter and it all still works.\n\n161\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.810\nSo now I could come up here and\nsay, instead of congratulations,\n\n162\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.728\nI'm thinking something like this.\n\n163\n00:08:56.728 --> 00:09:01.600\nWhen you have lots of these words whoa.\n\n164\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.142\nThen I'm gonna use these\ntriple quotes like so.\n\n165\n00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:06.140\nAll right?\n\n166\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.013\nAnd then, asterisk.\n&gt;&gt; Is that like a block of\n\n167\n00:09:09.013 --> 00:09:09.987\ncode?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a-\n\n168\n00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:11.200\n&gt;&gt; For the triple quotes.\n\n169\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.707\n&gt;&gt; Its a block of strings.\n\n170\n00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:13.388\nSo I can do multi-line strings.\n\n171\n00:09:13.388 --> 00:09:18.200\nWe may get some weirdness as far as\nindentation, but we'll deal with that\n\n172\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.110\nbecause technically the beginning of\nthis is also part of that string.\n\n173\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.671\nBut now that I have these, I can paste,\n\n174\n00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:33.201\nI can paste and\nthen I can add this, come over and\n\n175\n00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:38.467\nthese are final little finesses so\nto speak.\n\n176\n00:09:38.467 --> 00:09:41.664\nThey're not like blow your mind or\n\n177\n00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.071\nanything.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n178\n00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:47.338\nwhere you're putting the line breaks or\nwhere you hit enter and\n\n179\n00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:51.703\ndid all that space,\nit's going to read it, is it the pre-tag?\n\n180\n00:09:51.703 --> 00:09:54.342\nI know it's old, but where it's reading it\n\n181\n00:09:54.342 --> 00:09:56.940\nas exactly as you type it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is going to\n\n182\n00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.990\npreserve this as an entire string.\n\n183\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.940\nSo that's what I'm gonna do here,\nand I'm just making sure.\n\n184\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.910\nThis why I didn't wanna go crazy\nwith ASCII art because it bothers me\n\n185\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.880\nwhen it's not exact.\n\n186\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.180\nBut I'm gonna have to let it go and\n\n187\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.936\ngo to another screen apparently.\n&gt;&gt; You've\n\n188\n00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:16.577\nbeen hanging out with me too long.\n\n189\n00:10:16.577 --> 00:10:17.861\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know Vaughn.\n\n190\n00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:19.674\nSome days are rough.\n\n191\n00:10:19.674 --> 00:10:23.401\nAll right, so there we have it, right?\n\n192\n00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:29.296\nAnd I think I'm gonna add\none more of these lines, and\n\n193\n00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:35.460\ncopy and paste so\nI can have apparently nothing.\n\n194\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.310\nThere we go Vaughn.\n\n195\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.020\nMan.\n\n196\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.903\nSo, I have an odd number and\nthat way I can say, you win.\n\n197\n00:10:41.903 --> 00:10:44.160\nAll right?\n\n198\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:51.204\nSo how about win, right?\n\n199\n00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:53.990\nAnd if you wanted to go real crazy,\n\n200\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.842\nyou could build ASCII art letters.\n&gt;&gt; Like the lines where for each,\n\n201\n00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:01.100\nyou know, space it in and make the w.\n\n202\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.520\nYeah, that would take\na little bit of time, but\n\n203\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.760\nI see where you're going.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.036\n&gt;&gt; I would probably spend a lot of time on\n\n205\n00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:11.166\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you can spend a lot of time on it.\n\n206\n00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:16.983\nAnd you guessed, and\nI actually am prepping for\n\n207\n00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:20.478\nprepping for this episode.\n\n208\n00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:25.624\nAnd full disclosure, this is always\ngonna be a little messed up, because\n\n209\n00:11:25.624 --> 00:11:31.000\nwe don't know how many letters are in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's variable length of text,\n\n210\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.102\nand so that's gonna push it over\nfive letters versus ten letters.\n\n211\n00:11:35.102 --> 00:11:37.870\nSo you gotta let this one go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n212\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.000\nI'm gonna let it go, I'm gonna let it go.\n\n213\n00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.251\nBut now we can just say format.\n\n214\n00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:47.777\nActually I've spent like three hours\ntrying to make an ASCII art by hand just\n\n215\n00:11:47.777 --> 00:11:49.120\nto see if I could.\n\n216\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.080\nAnd I got some of them to work but\nI didn't like it, in preparations for\n\n217\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.710\nthis show, so I didn't use it.\n\n218\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.750\nSo we're just gonna go with\nsomething simpler, and\n\n219\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.090\nI'm just gonna say print\nthe banner like so, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.610\nAnd then accidentally hit save as.\n\n221\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.750\nSo what it's going to do?\n\n222\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.470\nYou guessed, you win, all right.\n\n223\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.410\nSo, this is a little more substantial,\nI think.\n\n224\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.547\nLet's see if we can win.\n\n225\n00:12:16.253 --> 00:12:21.390\nSo, notice, this is a little off.\n\n226\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:26.520\nActually, I can't scroll up behind my\nhead if we could just throw it up.\n\n227\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.374\nSee how it's all, man,\nthat would bug me, but you know\n\n228\n00:12:31.374 --> 00:12:35.067\nit's not gonna bug me enough to fix it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n229\n00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:38.977\nthis may be beyond the scope,\nbut could you fix it?\n\n230\n00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:42.605\nI mean could you do this kind\nof weird if so many letters,\n\n231\n00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:46.866\nand count the spaces, and\nsubtract it, and all that craziness?\n\n232\n00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:50.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could, but I'm not going to,\n\n233\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.210\nand well you might have an inkling\nof where this is going.\n\n234\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.183\nThis might be something that you\ntake on as one of those challenges.\n\n235\n00:12:58.183 --> 00:12:58.717\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n236\n00:12:58.717 --> 00:13:02.070\nI just want to make sure it is possible.\n\n237\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.430\nJust not in this series.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it is possible.\n\n238\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.530\nBut it's possible for you,\nnot necessarily for me.\n\n239\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.090\nSo we have our win banner and\nif we come back and we look,\n\n240\n00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.990\nyou know it's got that offset,\nand actually Vaughn used it.\n\n241\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.950\nWe got some conditional statements,\nwe had to do some subtracting,\n\n242\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.240\ncounting number of spaces, absolutely.\n\n243\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.050\nI hard coded these and that can happen.\n\n244\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.430\nThat can be just so, right?\n\n245\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.050\nHowever, I could generate\nthis programmatically.\n\n246\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:33.864\nSo I could say, print a line and\nthen print another line.\n\n247\n00:13:33.864 --> 00:13:37.816\nAnd then I could always make sure that\nthese have the same width regardless of\n\n248\n00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:41.230\nthe number of characters for\nwhat's being passed in.\n\n249\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.001\nBut what about this loser one?\n\n250\n00:13:44.001 --> 00:13:48.120\nI think I'm actually gonna copy and\npaste this as well.\n\n251\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.903\nAnd then say instead of win,\n\n252\n00:13:52.903 --> 00:13:58.290\nyou lose.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.180\n&gt;&gt; Notice there is more exclamation\n\n254\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:01.700\npoints.\n\n255\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.950\nYou did not guess.\n\n256\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.292\nAnd you know, if we're going to\nalways kind of have that off shoot,\n\n257\n00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:15.300\nwe're gonna at least make\nit look nice in the code.\n\n258\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.540\nAnd now when we lose,\n\n259\n00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.240\nyou should get, hey you lose, right?\n&gt;&gt; And it's okay that banner and\n\n260\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.970\nbanner, they're different functions.\n\n261\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:29.540\nSo you can call them differently, yes?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can reuse these variables.\n\n262\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.940\nIt's perfectly okay,\nbecause they're scoped to\n\n263\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.430\nthe inside of that function.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n264\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.580\n&gt;&gt; So this banner variable only exists,\n\n265\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.750\nas long as this function is running.\n\n266\n00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.706\nAnd then it kinda [NOISE]\nfloats away into the ether.\n\n267\n00:14:39.706 --> 00:14:41.850\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you could change that.\n\n268\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.950\nYou could do banner lose and banner win,\njust to kind of help your brain,\n\n269\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.200\nbut is it better, or worse, or against\nstylistic preferences on how you code?\n\n270\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.850\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n271\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.863\nthinking of a bunch of unique\nnames is sometimes difficult.\n\n272\n00:14:54.863 --> 00:15:00.742\nSo print_win_banner, I know that when I'm\nworking on this function I go all right,\n\n273\n00:15:00.742 --> 00:15:05.654\nI need to disregard everything around\nit unless I'm reaching into one of\n\n274\n00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:07.282\nthese things, right?\n\n275\n00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:10.620\nSo I'm pulling those into\nthe function from outside.\n\n276\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.020\nThe opposite way though is,\nwell it's not really going to happen.\n\n277\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:22.040\nSo as long as I'm only coding on banner,\nor print lose banner, then banner\n\n278\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.720\nmeans this thing in the context function,\nso I don't have to worry about it.\n\n279\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.020\nBut do be careful,\nit is good to think about this.\n\n280\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.610\nI don't think like a bunch of\nunique names, because I don't\n\n281\n00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.890\nspend a bunch of time thinking about\nunique names that are meaningful.\n\n282\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.307\nAnd then if I get really stressed out\nabout everything having a different name,\n\n283\n00:15:39.307 --> 00:15:42.571\nI've seen people start doing stuff like,\nwell, this is the x variable,\n\n284\n00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:45.736\nthis is the y variable, this is the x\nx variable, this is the y y variable.\n\n285\n00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:49.084\nYou know, like they are unique,\nbut they're no longer meaningful,\n\n286\n00:15:49.084 --> 00:15:52.715\nboth of those things are a banner,\nand they're in different functions, so\n\n287\n00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:55.653\nit's perfectly okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's like do file names, like one,\n\n288\n00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:57.975\ntwo, three, four, five and\nthen you come back and\n\n289\n00:15:57.975 --> 00:16:00.361\nyou have no idea what\nthe difference is between two.\n\n290\n00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:02.648\nThree, four and five.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n291\n00:16:02.648 --> 00:16:07.600\nSo let's go ahead and see if our lose\nbanner actually shows us that we lose.\n\n292\n00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.080\nAnd then I have a few challenges for\nyou as we get out of here.\n\n293\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.523\nAll right, so here we go,\nwe're gonna intentionally lose.\n\n294\n00:16:14.523 --> 00:16:18.778\nSo I guessed an a an it's it's banana,\nso I'm gonna guess anything but b.\n\n295\n00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:25.580\nSo p, w, e, m, and o.\n\n296\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.826\n[SOUND] You lose.\n\n297\n00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:28.570\nYou did not guess banana.\n\n298\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.460\nPress any key to end the game.\n\n299\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.670\nAnd boom, it clears out, and\nit's like the game was never there.\n\n300\n00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.946\nSo we've now added a nice\nlittle printed banner, right?\n\n301\n00:16:38.946 --> 00:16:41.670\nPeople were calling me out on it.\n\n302\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:46.238\nIf I'm actually being honest,\nI would probably change how that\n\n303\n00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:50.828\nprint_top_margin works.\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking the same thing in my\n\n304\n00:16:50.828 --> 00:16:51.450\nbrain.\n\n305\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.443\nI'm like, okay, well, you could kinda\nmake a, well, it's a top banner, but\n\n306\n00:16:54.443 --> 00:16:57.370\nif you change the whole top banner,\nthen that's gonna change when it starts.\n\n307\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.940\nAnd you don't wanna change that one.\n\n308\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.510\nYou only wanna change this\ntop after you've won or lost.\n\n309\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:09.460\nSo am I on the right thought process?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and we'll talk about that.\n\n310\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.510\nThere's one final thing that,\n\n311\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.548\ndon't let me forget that, Vonne.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n312\n00:17:12.548 --> 00:17:14.210\n&gt;&gt; See this repetition here?\n\n313\n00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.920\nPreviously we had clear_screen and\nprint_top_margin, right?\n\n314\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.640\nAnd we pulled those up to the top because\nthose came first in both of these ifs.\n\n315\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.430\nThis actually appears afterwards\nin both of these ifs.\n\n316\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.090\nSo I'm actually going to pull it down.\n\n317\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.970\nAnd now I can actually get rid of this.\n\n318\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.976\nInstead of having that repetition\nI can say okay, now clear_screen,\n\n319\n00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:37.323\nprint_top_margin.\n\n320\n00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:42.380\nIf you've won, print the win banner,\nif you've lost, print the lost banner.\n\n321\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.711\nThen wait, this is just,\nI'm just hijacking this for a wait, and\n\n322\n00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:47.740\nthen clear the screen and the game ends.\n\n323\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.521\nBut Vonne, you're on to something,\nthis print_top_margin currently,\n\n324\n00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:57.610\nprint_top_margin, if we come up here,\nit always prints a particular number.\n\n325\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.310\nWe could make this function\ntake an argument, and\n\n326\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.970\nthen we have an adjustable amount\nof lines of top margin, all right?\n\n327\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.830\nThat could be something you could extend.\n\n328\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.520\nI'm going to issue a few extensions\nto this that you should try out.\n\n329\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.880\nThis word list,\nyou could make it bigger, but\n\n330\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.930\nit would be handy if maybe there was\nanother file that would just a bunch of\n\n331\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.330\nwords that got read in\nas the game started.\n\n332\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.500\nThat way you couldn't go that one's\nbanana, that's our only B word, right?\n\n333\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.390\nSo add words either through just typing\nand typing and coping and pasting.\n\n334\n00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.020\nOr it would be better to read them in\nat the start of the game from a file.\n\n335\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.860\nMake it to where the top margin\nis actually adjustable, so\n\n336\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.790\nyou can print the banner at\na different level than the prompt.\n\n337\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.290\nAnd then figure out how to make\nthis to where it's always nice,\n\n338\n00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.420\nright, this actually requires\na little bit of logic.\n\n339\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.480\nSo if I put a different\nsize word in there,\n\n340\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.690\nthe banner borders are always the same,\nand they don't do that stair step.\n\n341\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:12.299\nAnd then finally, if you really want, if\nyou really want a challenge, right now we\n\n342\n00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:17.845\nget to play one time, and we never get to\nplay again until we type python main.py.\n\n343\n00:19:17.845 --> 00:19:22.457\nThe final one is ask the user\nif they want to play again or\n\n344\n00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:26.969\nnot, and if they do,\nrestart the game from the top and\n\n345\n00:19:26.969 --> 00:19:30.500\njust let them play as\nlong as they want to.\n\n346\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.110\nAnd then after that,\nif you've accomplished all of those,\n\n347\n00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.700\nthen you probably have a pretty good\ngrasp of what we've built together and\n\n348\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.842\nwhat you've built.\n\n349\n00:19:38.842 --> 00:19:42.830\nAnd well, the entire intention\nof this was to learn more and\n\n350\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.520\napply what you have learned\nup until this point.\n\n351\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.830\nSo those are my challenges to you.\n\n352\n00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:53.440\nI would be interested to see how those\ncome out for you, and you, and you also.\n\n353\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.170\nSo definitely let me know.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm challenged, and\n\n354\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.537\nI'm thinking, I need to ask you for help.\n\n355\n00:19:59.537 --> 00:20:00.037\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:20:00.037 --> 00:20:02.680\n&gt;&gt; But that's also because I would need\n\n357\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.687\nthat at my point in learning.\nBut so far, I mean,\n\n358\n00:20:05.687 --> 00:20:09.610\nthis has been a great series,\nI've leaned a ton, honestly.\n\n359\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.830\nAnd especially watching some of\nyour other shows, that were maybe\n\n360\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.770\na little bit more advanced for me,\nit's kind of explaining all of this.\n\n361\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.819\nSo I'm almost going backwards, I know\nyou all starting, hopefully here and\n\n362\n00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:21.706\nthen moving on.\n\n363\n00:20:21.706 --> 00:20:25.380\nSo hopefully you'll have that kind of\npre-cursor knowledge to get you started,\n\n364\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.350\nbut it is making a lot more things\nyou've done further down the road,\n\n365\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.360\nmake lot more sense to me.\n\n366\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.279\nSo thank you so much for\nthat, I really enjoyed it.\n\n367\n00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:34.736\nI hope you guys enjoyed it too,\n\n368\n00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:37.340\nbut we are gonna go ahead and\nwrap this whole series up.\n\n369\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.242\nSo signing off for DEVProTV,\nI've been your host,\n\n370\n00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:39.964\nVonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n371\n00:20:39.964 --> 00:20:41.582\nI'm Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n372\n00:20:41.582 -->
