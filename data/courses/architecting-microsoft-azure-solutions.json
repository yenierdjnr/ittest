the 70-535 series.\n\n4\n00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.280\nThat's right,\nArchitecting Microsoft Azure Solutions.\n\n5\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.523\nWe'd like to take a moment here and\ntell you what you can expect in some of\n\n6\n00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:17.701\nthe topics in the videos\nthat are gonna follow.\n\n7\n00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.635\nHere to help us with that is Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:20.685\nAdam, how we doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:21.445\n&gt;&gt; Doing well, how about you?\n\n10\n00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:21.985\n&gt;&gt; Doing good.\n\n11\n00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:22.603\nSo what kind of\n\n12\n00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:25.916\ntopics can we expect in the Architecting\nMicrosoft Azure Solution series?\n\n13\n00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:28.931\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna cover, actually,\nquite a bit of ground in this show.\n\n14\n00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:31.686\nWe've got six main topic\nareas we're gonna cover.\n\n15\n00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:34.227\nWe're actually throwing\nin a bonus seventh area.\n\n16\n00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.317\nNot part of the exam\nobjectives overall but\n\n17\n00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:39.660\nvery important from a foundational\nknowledge perspective.\n\n18\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.336\nJoin me here and let's take a quick\nlook at what we are gonna do and\n\n19\n00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:43.710\nhow we're gonna do it.\n\n20\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.984\nArchitecting Microsoft Azure Solutions\n70-535 exam went live in November 30th,\n\n21\n00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:55.448\nvery end of November 2017, depending\non when you're watching this show.\n\n22\n00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:59.817\nIt's still available, certainly,\navailable in, as you can see,\n\n23\n00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:02.240\nEnglish and other languages as well.\n\n24\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.202\nAnd it's gonna give you credit\ntowards the MCP, the MCSA Cloud and\n\n25\n00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:11.897\nMCSE Cloud, along with MCSD if\nyou are doing the complete Azure\n\n26\n00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:15.723\ntrack including\nthe Developing Azure Solutions.\n\n27\n00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:19.466\nWe're just focusing right now\non the architecture exam.\n\n28\n00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.090\nWhen we scroll down here,\nwe will see the skills measured.\n\n29\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.410\nYou can see the main objective varies,\neach of these has substantial\n\n30\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.250\nnumbers of sub-objective\ncategories associated with them.\n\n31\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.616\nRest assured, we will be going through\nevery one of them in painstaking and\n\n32\n00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:38.054\nexcruciating detail, as you will see\nbased on the overall episode count and\n\n33\n00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:40.776\namount of time we devote\nto discussions here.\n\n34\n00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:44.732\nBut the six main areas, Design and\nCompute Infrastructure,\n\n35\n00:01:44.732 --> 00:01:49.309\nwe'll take a look at everything and\nall things Azure VM and VM related.\n\n36\n00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:54.575\nUp to 25% of the overall exam objective\nquestions come from this one category,\n\n37\n00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:57.642\nand one of the main areas for\nexam preparation.\n\n38\n00:01:57.642 --> 00:02:01.020\nDesigning Data Implementation,\nall things data.\n\n39\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.570\nWe'll be talking about storage and all the\ndifferent types of storage solutions we\n\n40\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.350\nuse to create manage and\nultimately maintain data in our systems.\n\n41\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.030\nWe'll take a look at storage accounts.\n\n42\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.988\nWe'll talk about relational and\nnon-relational database types and\n\n43\n00:02:14.988 --> 00:02:16.204\nhow we manage those.\n\n44\n00:02:16.204 --> 00:02:19.150\nSome really interesting and\nfascinating stuff going on there.\n\n45\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.384\nDesigning Networking Implementations.\n\n46\n00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:25.451\nWe'll be taking a look at all of the\nconnectivity that we need to create and\n\n47\n00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:28.206\nthe systems associated\nwith that connectivity to\n\n48\n00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:30.829\nbe able to work with\ncompute infrastructure and\n\n49\n00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.521\nmanage data by accessing it once\nwe have infrastructure enabled.\n\n50\n00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.249\nWe'll take a look at subnetting,\nnot subnetting overall but subnets,\n\n51\n00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.220\nI should say.\n\n52\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.430\nWe'll throw a little bit of\nsubnetting in there as well.\n\n53\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.520\nWe'll talk about VNets, so\nvirtual networks and subnets within them.\n\n54\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.938\nWe'll talk about public and\nprivate IP address.\n\n55\n00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:52.515\nWe'll talk about NATting, we'll talk\nabout WAFs, web application firewalls.\n\n56\n00:02:52.515 --> 00:02:55.063\nWe'll talk about VPNs, point-to-site,\n\n57\n00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:57.953\nsite-to-site and\nExpressRoute connectivity.\n\n58\n00:02:57.953 --> 00:03:00.994\nWe'll take a look at UDRs,\nUser Defined Routes, and\n\n59\n00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:04.386\nall sorts of other implementation\nsolutions in that area.\n\n60\n00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:07.067\nDesign and Security and\nIdentity Solutions.\n\n61\n00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:11.080\nWe'll take a look at everything security\nand everything identity related.\n\n62\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.659\nMeaning, the Security Center and all\nthe solutions that we have associated with\n\n63\n00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.650\nsecuring and managing our infrastructure,\nrole-based access control, RBAC.\n\n64\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.007\nWe'll take a look at IAM,\nIdentity and Access Management.\n\n65\n00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:28.003\nThe ability to assign users, groups,\nand/or applications and service principal\n\n66\n00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:32.220\nidentities, rights to be able to interact\nwith manage and user infrastructure.\n\n67\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.066\nWe'll talk about and we'll take a look\nat the different Active directory\n\n68\n00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:40.470\nimplementation options that we have\navailable to us, both on-prem, cloud only,\n\n69\n00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.725\nand a hybrid solution.\n\n70\n00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:43.996\nAnd we'll take a look at Azure AD Connect,\n\n71\n00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:48.542\nwhich is the newest iteration of Directory\nSync and earlier versions of the directory\n\n72\n00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:52.290\nreplication and management tool\nsets that we need to work with.\n\n73\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050\nWe'll implement that solution and\n\n74\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.560\nshow you how to manage on-prem\nhybrid infrastructure.\n\n75\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.335\nDesigning Solutions by\nusing Platform Services.\n\n76\n00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:04.776\nThis is where we get into a lot of\nthe very specific interesting but\n\n77\n00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:08.897\nsiloed solutions that are available\non the Azure platform,\n\n78\n00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:13.666\nmachine learning, Microsoft's\nartificial intelligence, or AI,\n\n79\n00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:17.610\ncapabilities overall with\nCognitive Services APIs.\n\n80\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.590\nWe'll take a look at IoT,\nInternet of Things capabilities.\n\n81\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.864\nReally, extending broadly and\nwidely and deeply our management and\n\n82\n00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:27.936\nour data capabilities overall.\n\n83\n00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:31.138\nWe'll take a look at things\nlike Stream Analytics,\n\n84\n00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:33.440\nthe Azure IoT Hub, the Event Hub.\n\n85\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.790\nWe'll take a look at Event Grid,\nwe'll take a look at notification hubs.\n\n86\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.780\nWe'll talk about the Data Lake Factory.\n\n87\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.550\nThe Data Lake analytics solutions between\nthis area and data implementation.\n\n88\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.487\nLots of very, very big, very broad,\nglobal spanning infrastructures solutions\n\n89\n00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:54.012\nthat allow us to measure,\nmanage, and maintain data, and\n\n90\n00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:58.472\nimplement infrastructure, and\nthen manage it across the entire fabric.\n\n91\n00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:00.700\nAnd, finally, Design for Operations.\n\n92\n00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.390\nWe'll take a look at how we monitor,\noversee, and maintain infrastructure.\n\n93\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.090\nWe'll talk about and look at log analytics\nand the OMS, the Ops Management workspace,\n\n94\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.860\nwhich is an extension of\nthe Systems Center Ops Manager platform\n\n95\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.660\nbrought into Azure and\ncreated for our use inline.\n\n96\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.340\nWe'll be able to look at data\nfrom a variety of perspectives,\n\n97\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.395\nincluding automation and configuration\nmanagement capabilities using both\n\n98\n00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:31.010\nbuilt-in solutions, like Desired State\nConfiguration built right into Azure, as\n\n99\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.910\nwell as the ability to manage both Linux\nand Windows-based systems as a result.\n\n100\n00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.317\nWe'll look at third-party solutions,\nChef and Puppet and\n\n101\n00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:40.254\na variety of other interactive and\n\n102\n00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:45.226\noversight capabilities that we have with\nthese configuration management platforms.\n\n103\n00:05:45.226 --> 00:05:48.341\nAll of that are the exam objective\ncategories that are there.\n\n104\n00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.500\nI promised you a seventh bonus one,\nwhich is not listed.\n\n105\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.447\nBut if you take a look right below the\noverview that we're going through right\n\n106\n00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:58.421\nnow in the library, and\nstart going in order in this area,\n\n107\n00:05:58.421 --> 00:06:00.744\nyou will see that we\nhave a seventh category.\n\n108\n00:06:00.744 --> 00:06:04.844\nIt's the very first one we've created,\nand it's gonna be all about cloud design\n\n109\n00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:07.519\npatterns and\nour ability to be able to walk through and\n\n110\n00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:11.104\nexamine the eight categories of\ncloud design architecture patterns.\n\n111\n00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.208\nAnd put them into perspective for you,\n\n112\n00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:17.355\nwith regards to how they form the baseline\nand the foundational knowledge for\n\n113\n00:06:17.355 --> 00:06:21.499\nall these other areas in order to fully\nprepare you and in order to fully center\n\n114\n00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.871\nyou in the middle of our conversations\naround how we architect Azure solutions.\n\n115\n00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.915\nLook forward to walking\nthrough all that with you.\n\n116\n00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:30.729\nHopefully you're gonna be able to spend\ntime with us going through each and\n\n117\n00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.540\nevery one of those\nepisodes in the library.\n\n118\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.310\nBut whether you pick and\nchoose selectively to fill in the gaps or\n\n119\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.390\nyou go through it end to end,\nlot of exciting content.\n\n120\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.815\nAnd all you have to is shut this overview\noff and jump right into the library and\n\n121\n00:06:41.815 --> 00:06:43.245\nstart going through it with us.\n\n122\n00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:44.395\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n123\n00:06:44.395 -->
