          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.629\n[SOUND] In this video\nwe're gonna take a look at\n\n2\n00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.774\nthe AWS Certified Solutions\nArchitect: Associate\n\n3\n00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.275\ncertification content here on ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:15.435\nNow for those of you that are looking to\nget certified in AWS or just learn about\n\n5\n00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:19.870\nAmazon Web Services in general,\nthe ACSA is the starting point for you.\n\n6\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.130\nIn this certification we run\nthough basically an overview of\n\n7\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.650\nall of the different\nsolutions that make up AWS.\n\n8\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.250\nAmazon Web Services is actually\na really massive product,\n\n9\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.860\na collection of a number of\ndifferent utilities and services\n\n10\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.670\nthat when you put them all together create\nan amazing solutions infrastructure.\n\n11\n00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.420\nNow, who is this targeted towards?\n\n12\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.970\nWell, really anybody who wants\nto learn more about AWS and\n\n13\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.740\ncloud infrastructure, this is a great\nstarting point to jump in and get working.\n\n14\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.130\nBut it's really targeted toward SysOps and\nDevOps, people who are responsible for\n\n15\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.560\nmaintaining systems, and are looking\nto deploy them in the cloud, and\n\n16\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.730\nare entertaining using\nAWS as that solution.\n\n17\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.560\nSo, if you fit that mold,\nthis is the certification for you.\n\n18\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.250\nBut why is it that it targets\nthat kind of audience so well?\n\n19\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.670\nAnd the reason is, this certification's\na little bit different than some of\n\n20\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.490\nthe other ones that we do.\n\n21\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.190\nA lot of times we focus\nreally on the how to side.\n\n22\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.800\nHow to perform a certain activity.\n\n23\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.440\nHow to perform some certain job, or\n\n24\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.910\naction that needs to be\ndone to provide a service.\n\n25\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.680\nBut in this certification,\nit's more of a higher level overview of\n\n26\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.890\nhere's what this product is and\nwhat it does.\n\n27\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.990\nHere's what this other product is,\nand what it does.\n\n28\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.660\nAnd it gives you kind of the run of the\nwhole show, and that's really important.\n\n29\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.820\nBecause when you design a solution,\nwhen you architect a solution that's gonna\n\n30\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750\nbe running up in AWS, you need to\nunderstand what all your options are, and\n\n31\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.670\nhow to make sure that you\npick the best option.\n\n32\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.660\nHow do you know that your design is\nrunning as efficiently as it could?\n\n33\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.700\nMeanwhile there might be other services\navailable inside of the AWS suite that you\n\n34\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.510\ncan be leveraging to make your web server\nor database or whatever your solution is,\n\n35\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.390\nyour web application,\ncould be running that much faster.\n\n36\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.306\nThat's where the certified\nsolutions architect comes in.\n\n37\n00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:58.310\nLet me show you some of\nthe things that are on the exam.\n\n38\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.560\nI've got the web page pulled up here so\nwe can take a look at it.\n\n39\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.823\nAnd if you haven't been to this website,\nit's actually very valuable.\n\n40\n00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:06.520\nIt's right on Amazon's web page.\n\n41\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.390\nThey've got everything dialed down for\nyou.\n\n42\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.600\nBut they've got a little link over on\nthe side to download the exam guide.\n\n43\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.650\nAnd in the exam guide, they give\nyou a rundown of what prerequisite\n\n44\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.510\nknowledge is expected for you to have,\nas well as what is covered on the exam.\n\n45\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.330\nAnd that's really what I\nwanna highlight right here,\n\n46\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.500\nis what to expect on the exam itself.\n\n47\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.310\nAnd what you'll see is that the exam\nis divided up into four domains.\n\n48\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.730\nWe've got designing a highly available,\ncost-efficient, fault-tolerant,\n\n49\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.270\nscalable system.\n\n50\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.450\nNow that is a lot, right?\n\n51\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.510\nWe're not just saying hey, I wanna run\nWordPress in the cloud, that's not it.\n\n52\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.230\nI wanna run WordPress, but I want it\nto be fast, I want it to scale large,\n\n53\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.210\nI want it to be redundant and\nfault-tolerant.\n\n54\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.930\nI want all these other pieces.\n\n55\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.900\nAnd so, we take a look at all the\ndifferent resources in AWS that can make\n\n56\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.840\nthat happen.\n\n57\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.610\nAnd you'll notice that\nthat 60% of the exam,\n\n58\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.420\nover half the exam is right\nthere in that one domain.\n\n59\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.200\nThat's the main part, the main focus\nof this exam is not how to do it but\n\n60\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.550\nwhy to do it, right?\n\n61\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.490\nWhat do I choose?\n\n62\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.860\nHow do I create that design?\n\n63\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.675\nAnd then in the follow up certifications\nin these sys ops administrator, or\n\n64\n00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:17.810\nthe dev ops administrator exams.\n\n65\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.700\nThose focus on the actually how to do it,\nright?\n\n66\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.580\nHere's how we go in and\nwe set up multi AZ replication.\n\n67\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.880\nHere, we learn that we should\nset up multi AZ replication,\n\n68\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.310\nwhat benefit that provides us, right?\n\n69\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.477\nSo this is kind of the why\nthat leads to the how.\n\n70\n00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.155\nThe other three domains are important also\nthough, so we shouldn't neglect those.\n\n71\n00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:38.925\nThe second one is implementing deployment\nright, or implementing and applying.\n\n72\n00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:41.965\nSo actually putting our\npractices into action.\n\n73\n00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:45.020\nAnd you'll see that's\nonly 10% of the exam.\n\n74\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.480\nData security is next.\n\n75\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.880\nSecurity is very important.\n\n76\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.810\nWe need to make sure that our\nsolutions are protected, and\n\n77\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.280\nthat we don't have an unexpected release\nof customer information to the public.\n\n78\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.020\nThat's not something we wanna have happen.\n\n79\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.729\nAnd that makes up 20% of the exam.\n\n80\n00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.765\nAnd then lastly, we have troubleshooting.\n\n81\n00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:02.815\nSometimes things don't go quite\nthe way we hoped they should go.\n\n82\n00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:05.265\nAnd we need to be able to identify and\nresolve that.\n\n83\n00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.575\nAnd that makes up another 10% of the exam.\n\n84\n00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.425\nSo, you'll notice that those last\nthree domains really account for\n\n85\n00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:13.565\nless than half of what we're\ngonna be learning about.\n\n86\n00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:17.775\nAnd it shows how big of a stress this exam\nis putting on actually creating a design.\n\n87\n00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:20.930\nUnderstanding why you would use\ncertain solutions versus others\n\n88\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.940\nto meet the needs of a customer or\nmeet the needs of your company.\n\n89\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.703\nSo that's all kind of critical\ninformation to be thinking about.\n\n90\n00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:29.898\nIf you have a chance to look at this guide\nthough, it does break down even further\n\n91\n00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:33.049\ninto the domains and talk about the\nindividual components you're expected to\n\n92\n00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:36.520\nknow, and what you really should\nhave kind of going into the exam.\n\n93\n00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.170\nNow let's talk about\nthat exam a little bit.\n\n94\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.240\nThe exam itself,\nthey post the information right here.\n\n95\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.510\nIt's 80 minutes so\nit's not a terribly long exam,\n\n96\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.020\njust under an a hour and a half.\n\n97\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.890\nAnd basically you can jump in and\ntake it, it is computer based.\n\n98\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.770\nThere's a few places you\ncan take it in person but\n\n99\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.840\nmost of us are gonna take it online\nthrough the Web Assessor system.\n\n100\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.460\nIt’s $150 and once you sign up, you use\nthe, there’s a link over here that says,\n\n101\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.560\nschedule an exam and\nthat will take you to Web Assessor.\n\n102\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.810\nAnd from here, you can create a free\naccount and then you sign up for\n\n103\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.300\nthe exam which is a $150.\n\n104\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.980\nThe free account allows you to track all\nof your certifications that you do through\n\n105\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.760\nWeb Assessor.\n\n106\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.530\nSo as you continue on through\nAmazon’s other certifications,\n\n107\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.810\nyou’ll be able to track their completion,\n\n108\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.220\nemployer certificate, and other\ninformation all right from one place.\n\n109\n00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.010\nYou sign up from here,\n\n110\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.210\nand then you're able to take the exam\nfrom the comfort of your own home.\n\n111\n00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.000\nYou can take it from the office,\nor wherever.\n\n112\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.660\nAnd you'll be able to get certified, and\n\n113\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.660\nthen jump out there and\nput everything you learned into practice.\n\n114\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.700\nAnd hopefully continue on with the other\nAWS certifications that are available.\n\n115\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.190\nAll right well that's a pretty good\nrun down of what's on the exam.\n\n116\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.120\nI hope it all sounded interesting to you.\n\n117\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.040\nIf it's what you're excited to learn about\nthen stay tuned because we've got episodes\n\n118\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.370\nof AWS Certified Solutions\nArchitect Associate coming up next.\n\n119\n00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.030\nNow if that didn't sound\nquite exciting for you or\n\n120\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.470\nyou're worried about not knowing enough\nabout cloud infrastructure before diving\n\n121\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.600\nin, be sure to check out a lot of the\nother certifications we have on IT Pro TV.\n\n122\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.370\nThere's some certifications like Network+\nthat are really beneficial to have already\n\n123\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.640\ngotten under your belt before\njumping into cloud technology.\n\n124\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.520\nCuz networking is so important.\n\n125\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.830\nThat's base knowledge that\nyou're really expected to have.\n\n126\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.460\nSo if you find yourself struggling\nwith the ACSA just jump over and\n\n127\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.250\ncheck out Network+ for a little while,\nand then come back when you're ready.\n\n128\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.054\nAll of that's available as part\nof your ITPro.TV subscription.\n\n129\n00:06:20.054 --> 00:06:23.505\nAll right, I hope you guys enjoyed it and\nI'll see you in the episodes.\n\n130\n00:06:23.505 --> 00:06:27.934\n[SOUND]\n\n",
