that\n\n3\n00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.583\nwe have lined up for you here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:16.703\nAnd joining me today to\nhelp us guide through that,\n\n5\n00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:18.488\nwell it's none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:19.393\nHow's it going today Don?\n\n7\n00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:20.990\n>> It's going great Daniel, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.885\njust excited to kick off\nanother new series on ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:27.337\nNow, if you haven't heard about Microsoft\nAzure SQL, let's start there, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:28.757\nwe'll talk about what it is, and\n\n11\n00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:31.379\nwe'll get a chance to see what\nwe're going to be doing here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.304\nMicrosoft Azure SQL is\na hosted database service, or\n\n13\n00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:37.099\nrelational database service\nfrom Microsoft, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:41.330\nit's really cool because databases\nhave become so important to companies.\n\n15\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.539\nYou put your data in, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.350\nyou expect to get your data back out when\nyou need it and you expect it to be fast.\n\n17\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.525\nSo a lot of organizations have to worry\nabout when they build the database making\n\n18\n00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.826\nit reliable, making it available,\nmaking it nice and fast and\n\n19\n00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:55.156\nkeeping it maintained.\n\n20\n00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:57.852\nAnd thatâ€™s a lot of work and\ncan be quite expensive.\n\n21\n00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:01.602\nWith Azure SQL, we can get\nMicrosoft to do the work for us.\n\n22\n00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.850\nThey'll host the database on\ntheir servers up in Azure cloud.\n\n23\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.289\nThey'll maintain the servers.\n\n24\n00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.091\nIf there's a fault,\nlike a hard drive fails or something,\n\n25\n00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.695\ntheir network operations center catches\nit, gets in there and repairs it.\n\n26\n00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:17.117\nThey do all the leg work for us,\nand we get to focus on our data.\n\n27\n00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:18.997\nI need a table with some data in it.\n\n28\n00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:20.356\nI don't care about\nthe underlying database.\n\n29\n00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.213\nMicrosoft's already dealt with that for\nme.\n\n30\n00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:24.094\nI can throw that in there,\nget it up and going.\n\n31\n00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:27.614\nNow you can actually get a lot of control\non the database if you want it, or\n\n32\n00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:29.659\nyou can let Microsoft have that control.\n\n33\n00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.578\nIt's up to you, but if you're one of those\npeople that just needs a database and\n\n34\n00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:36.211\nwants it to be as reliable and\navailable as possible,\n\n35\n00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.450\nMicrosoft Azure SQL is\na great way to do that.\n\n36\n00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.506\n>> Yeah, sounds awesome, Don.\n\n37\n00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:44.357\nNow who exactly would be the demographic\nthat we're focusing here with Azure SQL?\n\n38\n00:01:44.357 --> 00:01:46.917\n>> So, there's actually a few\ndifferent types of people.\n\n39\n00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:50.027\nBack in the day, we used to just say,\nwell DBA is database administrators.\n\n40\n00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:54.528\nBut the whole point of Azure SQL is\nthat you don't have to be a DBA anymore.\n\n41\n00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:59.011\nSo the Azure SQL product is great for\npeople like system admins, right?\n\n42\n00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:02.131\nIn the past, you might have been\nresponsible for building up a physical\n\n43\n00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.260\nserver to be able to put SQL on there and\nthen turn it over to the dev team.\n\n44\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.617\nNow, you can just reach out and\nprovision it in Azure.\n\n45\n00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:09.938\nAnd so\nsys admins can really benefit from this.\n\n46\n00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:13.853\nBut developers can benefit from it also,\nbecause you might need a SQL database and\n\n47\n00:02:13.853 --> 00:02:17.843\nyou don't want to mess around the Windows\nserver operating system under the hood.\n\n48\n00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:19.515\nYou don't want to do updates.\n\n49\n00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.036\nYou don't want to be saddled with that.\n\n50\n00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:21.755\nYou're a developer.\n\n51\n00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:22.812\nYou want to write your product.\n\n52\n00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:23.766\nYou need a database, but\n\n53\n00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:26.459\nyou don't want to be involved in\nthe interworkings of that database.\n\n54\n00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.514\nYou just need a place to put your data.\n\n55\n00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.391\nAzure SQL works out great for you too.\n\n56\n00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.107\nSo it starts to fall into\nwhat we call dev ops, right?\n\n57\n00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:37.147\nWhere you might be a developer,\nyou might be operations, or\n\n58\n00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:38.708\nyou might be tasked with both.\n\n59\n00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:42.273\nThen this show's really gonna work out\nwell for you, cuz we can show how you can\n\n60\n00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:45.315\nuse Azure SQL and not have to worry\nabout the nitty gritty details.\n\n61\n00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:49.631\nJust let it be done with, and as your\norganization grows, if you're an internet\n\n62\n00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:53.945\nstartup and you're getting rapid growth,\nyou can dial up these databases to get\n\n63\n00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:58.283\nhigher performance and far exceed what\nyou can do with on-premises equipment.\n\n64\n00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:02.355\nSo, really, any of those types of roles,\nthis show is gonna work out well for you.\n\n65\n00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:04.319\n>> Excellent.\nNow that we know who should be watching\n\n66\n00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.121\nthis show or\nmight be interested in this show,\n\n67\n00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:07.843\nwhat is it exactly that we're gonna cover.\n\n68\n00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:11.437\nGive us some idea of what we're\ngonna see in the upcoming shows.\n\n69\n00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:14.480\nRight, I've kind of structured the\nepisodes to be broken up into five parts,\n\n70\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.494\nand in the beginning we're just going\nto talk about implementing Azure SQL.\n\n71\n00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:19.583\nHow do I create that database server.\n\n72\n00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.031\nHow do I create the database on it.\n\n73\n00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.247\nHow do I get connected to that data\nbase so I can use the darn thing?\n\n74\n00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:25.268\nWe're gonna start out there.\n\n75\n00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:29.110\nSo if you know absolutely zero\nabout Azure SQL you'll be fine..\n\n76\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.526\nThat's where we're gonna start.\n\n77\n00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:35.463\nBut after that, creating the database\nis one part, using it is another.\n\n78\n00:03:35.463 --> 00:03:36.879\nAnd that's where we're gonna\nbreak into other things.\n\n79\n00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.364\nWe'll take a look at how\nto maintain the databases,\n\n80\n00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:41.630\nwhich actually is really\neasy inside of Azure.\n\n81\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.230\nBut there's some things we can\ndo to help improve performance.\n\n82\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.642\nWe're gonna see how to optimize and\n\n83\n00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.430\ntroubleshoot our database in\nthe event that we're having problems.\n\n84\n00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.924\nIf we're running queries and they're\njust not running fast, we can try and\n\n85\n00:03:51.924 --> 00:03:52.588\nfind out why.\n\n86\n00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:55.388\nWe're gonna take a look at\nhow we manage our data,\n\n87\n00:03:55.388 --> 00:03:59.457\nwhich is going to include things like\nbacking up and restoring the data,\n\n88\n00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:03.948\nas well as doing bulk imports or exports\nof data, all sorts of good stuff there.\n\n89\n00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:05.863\nAnd then lastly we're\ngonna talk about security.\n\n90\n00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:10.028\nHow we secure our Azure databases to make\nsure that they are not a weak point,\n\n91\n00:04:10.028 --> 00:04:14.585\nbecause it's a rare week that goes by that\nwe don't worry about some company having\n\n92\n00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:15.452\na data breach.\n\n93\n00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:16.683\nYou don't wanna be that company.\n\n94\n00:04:16.683 --> 00:04:19.167\nSo we'll talk a little bit\nhow to lock those down.\n\n95\n00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:19.783\n>> Awesome.\n\n96\n00:04:19.783 --> 00:04:24.071\nNow Don, I know that a lot, well I know\nfor certain that Microsoft has a SQL exam.\n\n97\n00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:28.007\nIs this show going to map toward that\nexam, or is it something different?\n\n98\n00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:29.790\n>> This one is going to be a little\nsomething different, right?\n\n99\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.862\nMost of the shows here on ITPro TV\ndo focus on kind of working\n\n100\n00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:36.638\ntowards a certification, but\nthis one's more of a technical skills.\n\n101\n00:04:36.638 --> 00:04:39.241\nWe want to show you guys\nthe really important parts,\n\n102\n00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:42.033\nthe stuff in Azure SQL that\nyou're gonna use everyday.\n\n103\n00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:44.758\nWhen you study for a certification,\nyou learn a lot of great stuff.\n\n104\n00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:47.023\nA lot of great technologies that\nsometimes you don't implement, right?\n\n105\n00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:48.822\nThat just aren't used by a lot of people.\n\n106\n00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.865\nWe're gonna focus on the details, right?\n\n107\n00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:53.816\nThe stuff that you know you're\ngoing to use every single day.\n\n108\n00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:55.233\nSo it's all great content.\n\n109\n00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.855\nI'm always excited about\nthe tech skills shows that we do.\n\n110\n00:04:57.855 --> 00:05:01.523\nI know they don't lead to a certification\nbut what they do lead to is job success.\n\n111\n00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:04.659\nYou really learn that skill, and\nyou're ready to get out there and\n\n112\n00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.861\nimplement it and it's not some\nfringe topic that you may never see.\n\n113\n00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:10.692\n>> Awesome, well it sounds like\na really practical course, so\n\n114\n00:05:10.692 --> 00:05:13.808\nanybody that's interested in Azure SQL,\nthis is the place to be.\n\n115\n00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:15.419\nThese upcoming episodes\nare going to be awesome.\n\n116\n00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.358\nWeâ€™re really working hard to\ncreate great content with that, so\n\n117\n00:05:19.358 --> 00:05:21.803\nhopefully we'll see you in the future.\n\n118\n00:05:21.803 --> 00:05:22.303\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
