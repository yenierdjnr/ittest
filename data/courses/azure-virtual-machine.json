that\n\n3\n00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:14.901\nwe're gonna make available\nhere from ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.401\nAnd Don, you're here to help us walk\nthrough what we should actually come to\n\n5\n00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:19.500\nexpect from this show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.930\nThere's a lot of cool stuff coming up.\n\n7\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.590\n>> Yeah, it's a neat one.\n\n8\n00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.880\nIn the world of cloud services,\na lot of people have heard of Amazon and\n\n9\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.970\nEC2 and\neven Google Compute to a lesser extent,\n\n10\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700\nsome of the other vendors\nthat are out there.\n\n11\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.460\nBut Microsoft's Azure has\nreally been gaining steam,\n\n12\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.780\nand you can do a lot of stuff in Azure,\na lot of database hosting and\n\n13\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.750\ninstance hosting,\nall sorts of crazy things.\n\n14\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.773\nBut in this show we're gonna focus\nspecifically on virtual machines.\n\n15\n00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:48.718\nTaking your servers, that in the past\nmight have been physical servers, or even\n\n16\n00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:52.663\nvirtual servers in your own environment,\nand moving them up into the Azure cloud\n\n17\n00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:56.380\nwhere you can start to take advantage\nof a lot of really cool features.\n\n18\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.840\nAnd just the efficiencies of scale that\nyou get by running in a world-class\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.500\ndata center like one of Microsoft's.\n\n20\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.860\nAnd I mean it's a really powerful tool.\n\n21\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.660\nA lot of people are nervous or\n\n22\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.680\njust don't necessary trust\nmaking that jump into the cloud.\n\n23\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.360\nAnd so, what we hope to do with this\nshow is take away that nervousness,\n\n24\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.670\nthat trepidation and\nmake you recognize that, boy,\n\n25\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.030\nthere's some really good\nstuff to be found there.\n\n26\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.220\nAnd it's really inexpensive,\nwhich is kind of a benefit in most books.\n\n27\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.500\nBut we'll get a chance to see that, see\nsome of the cool features, and really just\n\n28\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.990\njump in there and tackle using Windows\nAzure to support our virtual machines.\n\n29\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.834\n>> Now Don you're using a lot\nof big words there, and\n\n30\n00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:36.968\nobviously this is probably not for\nthe intro [LAUGH] into IT kinda person,\n\n31\n00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:40.053\nwho is the target audience for\nthis specific course?\n\n32\n00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:42.483\n>> All right, so who we're giving this\ntowards are really gonna be system\n\n33\n00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:43.100\nadmins, right?\n\n34\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.690\nSo, these are people who either currently\nalready have some systems in Azure.\n\n35\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.160\nOr support local servers and\nwanna make that jump to Azure.\n\n36\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.860\nBut the key point is that you're\nalready working with servers.\n\n37\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.610\nNow, I'm leaving clients out of this.\n\n38\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.816\nYou can put Windows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows 10 clients in Azure.\n\n39\n00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:01.060\nBut it's not really what it's made for.\n\n40\n00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.560\nIt's really made for servers.\n\n41\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.160\nSo, you need to have some experience\nwith either Linux or Windows as a server\n\n42\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.730\ndeployed in the environment and kinda be\nsupporting that before you jump into this.\n\n43\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.110\nIf you don't understand those concepts,\nif you don't have that foundational\n\n44\n00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.780\nknowledge, it's really hard to view\nthe difference between virtualizing versus\n\n45\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.955\nphysical, and it really just\nkind of falls to pieces there.\n\n46\n00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:23.462\nSo,you really should have already kind of\nmade some steps as far as getting your\n\n47\n00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:25.966\nMCSA, or\nat least an MCP in Windows Server.\n\n48\n00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.120\nYou've kind of worked\nwith that technology.\n\n49\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.790\nYou've implemented it out\nthere in the field, and\n\n50\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.770\nnow you're looking at how you can benefit\nby putting it into a virtual environment.\n\n51\n00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.540\nSo, yeah, definitely not the starting\nout type show for somebody.\n\n52\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.617\nStarting out, if you've never even\ngone to the Microsoft Azure web page,\n\n53\n00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:42.246\nyou'll be fine, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.070\nBut you gotta have some server experience.\n\n55\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.130\nYou gotta to understand what that's\nlike to host your own system.\n\n56\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.160\nTo see about moving that into a virtual\nworld, that's the big difference.\n\n57\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.992\nBut if you've never even heard of Azure,\nif you've never even heard of AWS,\n\n58\n00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:55.274\nor Google Computer, or whatever,\nyou'll be fine, right?\n\n59\n00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:59.056\nWe are gonna cover it all from the\nbeginning to advanced as we move through\n\n60\n00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:02.020\nusing your virtual machines\nin Microsoft Azure.\n\n61\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.540\n>> All right Don.\n\n62\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.600\nNow it's time to dangle\nthe really good bait out there.\n\n63\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.480\nTell these good folks,\n\n64\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.710\nwhat are we going to cover, what should\nthey expect to learn in this class?\n\n65\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.341\n>> All right, so\n\n66\n00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.613\nwe're gonna tackle some things that\nI consider really need-to-know.\n\n67\n00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:19.050\nWe're gonna start off with just\na broad introduction to Azure.\n\n68\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.899\nSo if you have never heard of it,\nwe'll give you that intro.\n\n69\n00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:25.375\nAnd in that one we're gonna talk about\nthings like pricing, which is important.\n\n70\n00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.723\nYou gotta understand how this is\nbilled and determine whether or\n\n71\n00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:29.297\nnot you're actually saving money or not.\n\n72\n00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:32.515\nWe're gonna talk about some of\nthe advanced features we get by being\n\n73\n00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:33.030\nin Azure.\n\n74\n00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.980\nThe stuff like the heavy redundancy, and\ninfrastructure, network operation center,\n\n75\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.040\npeople that are super talented.\n\n76\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.620\nJust tons of advantages of being there.\n\n77\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.380\nSo we'll get a chance to see those.\n\n78\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.680\nWe're also gonna take a look at how to\ndeploy virtual machines, be they Linux or\n\n79\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.370\nWindows, into the Windows Azure.\n\n80\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.340\nWe'll talk about how to convert a physical\nsystem to move it into a virtual system.\n\n81\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.380\nIf you've already got servers locally and\nyou wanna move them into Azure,\n\n82\n00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.280\nwe'll get a chance to see how to do that,\nand that process.\n\n83\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.640\nWe'll talk about some of the different\nconfigurations for those servers,\n\n84\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.220\nthe different ways that we can\nspec them out for performance.\n\n85\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.520\nAnd once they're up and running,\nwe'll talk about how we can manage them.\n\n86\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.846\nHow we can make sure they're running just\nfine, staying up, staying in business, and\n\n87\n00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:14.419\nreally leveraging some of\nthe high availability and\n\n88\n00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.280\nredundancy features that\nare available in Azure.\n\n89\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.170\nIt's a very complex network, and\n\n90\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.430\nit's up to you to make sure\nyou take advantage of it.\n\n91\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.000\nWe're also gonna talk about\nhow to backup and restore.\n\n92\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.130\nCuz this is really weird, right?\n\n93\n00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.929\nWhen you got a physical server,\nI need to back up that physical server.\n\n94\n00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:30.540\nAnd when it's time to restore I go and\ngrab those tapes.\n\n95\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.560\nBut when it's all virtual, and\n\n96\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.420\nit's all up there in the cloud you\ndon't even know the physical server.\n\n97\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.810\nYou don't even know what it looks like.\n\n98\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.360\nBut you've got to backup it and\nrestore it, that's just really weird.\n\n99\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.300\nSo, we're gonna talk about\nhow that process works too.\n\n100\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.860\nAnd throughout all of that, which sounds\nlike good stuff, but throughout all of\n\n101\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.660\nthat, we're also gonna be talking about\nsome of the other features in Azure\n\n102\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.770\nthat we can use to supplement the virtual\nmachines to make them even more robust.\n\n103\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.040\nSo there's a couple of neat little things,\nlike DNS, that we'll get into.\n\n104\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.420\nYou can build VM's all day long and\nnot worry about DNS at all.\n\n105\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.770\nBut sooner or later you're gonna wanna\nattach a host name to a virtual machine,\n\n106\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.776\nand you'll need to know\na little bit about DNS.\n\n107\n00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:09.030\nSo we'll cover some of that too all\nthroughout the course of the series.\n\n108\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.300\n>> Sounds very, very cool so far.\n\n109\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.340\nNow, I know a lot of the shows\nthat we do here at ITProTV,\n\n110\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.880\nthey're exam oriented, right?\n\n111\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.620\nThey're working you toward an exam.\n\n112\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.440\nIs there an exam associated with this?\n\n113\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.770\n>> Not really, not yet.\n\n114\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.119\nSo Microsoft is working on several\ndifferent Azure certifications, and\n\n115\n00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.613\nthey've got a few of\nthe MCSE-level stuff that does.\n\n116\n00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:30.994\nBut at the lower level, the kinda getting\nstarted like we're gonna be doing, and\n\n117\n00:05:30.994 --> 00:05:32.808\neven some of the advanced\nstuff we get into,\n\n118\n00:05:32.808 --> 00:05:35.180\nthey really don't have an exam\nthat's catered to this.\n\n119\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.680\nSo this is more of a technical skills\nshow, one that's done for your benefit.\n\n120\n00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.760\nJust the knowledge that you\nwant to gain from it, not so\n\n121\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.590\nmuch based on getting\na certification out of it.\n\n122\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.910\nStill very valuable knowledge.\n\n123\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.920\n>> Well awesome stuff Don.\n\n124\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.770\nI know it sounds like\na really awesome show.\n\n125\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.918\nI'm looking forward to\ndoing the show with you.\n\n126\n00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:50.530\nAnd hopefully we'll see you guys there.\n\n127\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.160\nA lot of great content coming up.\n\n128\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.640\nSo stay tuned and\n\n129\n00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.380\njoin us with these new Azure from\nMicrosoft and their virtual machines.\n\n130\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.470\nAnd we'll see you then.\n\n131\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.319\n[SOUND]\n\n",
