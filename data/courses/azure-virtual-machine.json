The course is geared toward system administrators, who currently have systems in Azure or support local servers and want to transition over to Azure. One should expect to learn how to deploy virtual machines into Windows Azure, different configurations of those servers and how to manage them, the process of how to back up and restore a server and other features in Azure that can be used to supplement a virtual machine.",
