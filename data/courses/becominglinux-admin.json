All right, so Becoming a Linux\nSystem Administrator is a course that's\n\n6\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.370\ndesigned to really take your skills with\nLinux and move them up to the next level.\n\n7\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.580\nA lot of people use Linux as an operating\nsystem, and it's used on servers across\n\n8\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720\nthe world, a lot of the Internet\nservices we access use Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.070\nBut even on the desktop,\nthere's plenty of people like me,\n\n10\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.986\nwhere I'm running Linux right here\non my own desktop, and that's great.\n\n11\n00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:38.230\nIf you're just an individual,\nit works really well.\n\n12\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.563\nBut when you move into the business world,\nand now you're managing desktops and\n\n13\n00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.067\nlaptops for hundreds, thousands,\ntens of thousands of users,\n\n14\n00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.438\nthings are a little bit different, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.629\nIf I just wanna install software for\nmyself, that's no big deal, but\n\n16\n00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.985\nif I wanna install software for\n100 people, that's much different,\n\n17\n00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:57.170\nit's a different type of experience.\n\n18\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.663\nAnd so in the Becoming\na Linux System Administrator series.\n\n19\n00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:03.582\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's tough.\n\n20\n00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:06.120\n[LAUGH] In this series,\n\n21\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.180\nwe take a look at what those skills are,\nhow things are different.\n\n22\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.010\nReally, we can almost call this\nseries Linux in the Business, right?\n\n23\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.800\nInstead of using it for\na personal computer or\n\n24\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.170\njust as a hobbyist type thing,\nhow is it used in a business?\n\n25\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.000\nAnd how is that different than\nadministering a system just for ourselves?\n\n26\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.093\nAnd that's really what we'll get a chance\nto see right here in this series.\n\n27\n00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:28.946\n&gt;&gt; And Don, who would benefit\nmost from watching the Becoming\n\n28\n00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:31.280\na Linux System Administrator series?\n\n29\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, really, anybody who uses Linux\nwould benefit from it, but really,\n\n30\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.260\nit's gonna be people using\nLinux in the workplace.\n\n31\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.930\nThere's some of the things we learn,\n\n32\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.030\nlike configuring multiple\nuser accounts on a system.\n\n33\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.950\nWell, if it's your home computer, you're\nprobably the only person who uses it,\n\n34\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.940\nyou're not gonna need\nmultiple user accounts.\n\n35\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.430\nBut in a workplace,\nit's very common to have shared computers,\n\n36\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.940\nwhere you might have ten different\nemployees that could sit down and\n\n37\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.700\nuse a computer at a particular time.\n\n38\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.420\nAnd that's something we have to support.\n\n39\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.478\nSo if you're using Linux in the workplace,\nthis series is really gonna benefit you.\n\n40\n00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:05.950\nNow, if you're a home user, but you're\nthinking about getting a job supporting\n\n41\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.390\nLinux in the workplace, then again, this\nis gonna be a great skill set to have,\n\n42\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.080\nthat you'll be able to use when you\nget out there in the workforce.\n\n43\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.510\nSo either side can benefit,\n\n44\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780\nbut really, it is geared towards people\nsupporting Linux in the workplace.\n\n45\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.797\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nis there a certification that you can get?\n\n46\n00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:21.449\n&gt;&gt; There are a number of\ncertifications that are out there, but\n\n47\n00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.940\nthis particular series\nisn't built around them.\n\n48\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.540\nWe wanted to focus specifically on the\nskills that you needed to support Linux\n\n49\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.800\nfrom that system administrator type role.\n\n50\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.217\nThere are certifications, like the CompTIA\nLinux+ and the LPIC-1 certification,\n\n51\n00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:37.710\nthat both cover everything I'm\ngonna cover here in this series.\n\n52\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.820\nBut they cover a lot more, also,\nthey go well beyond it, and so\n\n53\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.410\nthey're really designed for\nmore advanced Linux users.\n\n54\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.027\nIf you're just getting started\nin system administration,\n\n55\n00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:45.828\nthat can be really daunting.\n\n56\n00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:49.174\nSo we wanted to focus on the core\ntasks that were really important,\n\n57\n00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:53.150\nthe things that, really, you need\nto know out there in the workplace.\n\n58\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.710\nAnd then once you've got a grasp of that\nand a firm understanding, then you can\n\n59\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.520\nstart studying the more advanced things\nand move on to those other certifications.\n\n60\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.000\nWe've already got those courses\non the ITProTV site, so for\n\n61\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.910\nthose of you who are ready for\nthat, you can jump right to it.\n\n62\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.380\nBut for everybody else,\nthis is where we'll want to start.\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.760\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhat topics are covered in this series?\n\n64\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we cover a lot of neat\nthings, and this is an evolving course, so\n\n65\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.170\nwe can always add more things to it later.\n\n66\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.360\nBut the core things that\nwe're gonna cover are,\n\n67\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.990\nfirst off, learning system administration.\n\n68\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.620\nSo what do we mean by\nsystem administration, and\n\n69\n00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.720\nwhy is that different than\non a personal computer?\n\n70\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.060\nThen we'll take a look\nat installing Linux.\n\n71\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.250\nI know it seems like installing Linux is\npretty easy, you boot the computer up and\n\n72\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.407\nyou press next 15 times.\n\n73\n00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:32.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n74\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.443\nthere's a lot of choices you can\nmanipulate in there that change the way\n\n75\n00:03:35.443 --> 00:03:38.840\nthe computer behaves, and so we're gonna\ntake a look at how that gets installed.\n\n76\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.260\nThen we'll take a look at getting and\n\n77\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.770\nmanaging software, how we load software on\nthe system, how we keep it up to date, and\n\n78\n00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.830\nhow we can manage that and\ncontrol people's access to it.\n\n79\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.560\nThen we take a look at\nmanaging user accounts.\n\n80\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.068\nI mentioned in the workplace,\nit's not uncommon to have shared systems.\n\n81\n00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:56.097\nSo how do we control user access, and\nrestrict access to some people and\n\n82\n00:03:56.097 --> 00:03:57.780\nallow access to others?\n\n83\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.305\nWe'll get a chance to see that.\nAnd then finally,\n\n84\n00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:03.837\nwe'll talk about managing disks and file\nsystems, how we control the way that our\n\n85\n00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:08.236\nhard drives are presented to the operating\nsystem, who has access to what, and\n\n86\n00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:11.080\nthe other resources that\nare found inside of that.\n\n87\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.312\nSo all of this is kinda pertaining to\nkeeping our system up and running, and\n\n88\n00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:17.543\nhealthy, and the things that we do in\nthe workplace, things like adding or\n\n89\n00:04:17.543 --> 00:04:20.555\nreplacing a hard drive, and\nhow that's reflected inside of the OS.\n\n90\n00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:24.370\nThose are things we need to know if we're\ngoing to be a system administrator.\n\n91\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.630\n&gt;&gt; So if Becoming a Linux System\nAdministrator sounds interesting to you,\n\n92\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.850\nmake sure you check out all the videos,\nall the lessons in the series.\n\n93\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.172\nThank you for watching.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:12.178\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.867\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to Becoming\na Linux System Admin series,\n\n5\n00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.280\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.590\nIn this episode we're going to be\ntaking a look at how we can utilize\n\n7\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.160\ngraphical tools within a Linux\nenvironment for management purposes.\n\n8\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.690\nBack in studio, with us today, we have Mr.\nDon Pezet, how's it going, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it is going great, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.210\nReady to jump right back\ninto the world of Linux.\n\n11\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.955\nAnd this is gonna be a fun episode\nbecause we're gonna learn about system\n\n12\n00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.662\nadministration, which, you know,\ncan be a little bit challenging.\n\n13\n00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:41.584\nBut we're gonna learn about the graphical\nuser interface tools that are available to\n\n14\n00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.700\nhelp us do that, so it's not such\na nightmare like a lot of us think.\n\n15\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.520\nSo we got all that lined up,\nright here in this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.420\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, because there are so\nmany variants or flavors of\n\n17\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.560\nLinux distributions, the tools that\nwere gonna be looking at in this show.\n\n18\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.710\nAre they applicable to all those different\nflavors, or what are we talking about?\n\n19\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.230\n&gt;&gt; I have to be noncommittal on that one.\n\n20\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.090\nBecause some of the stuff that\nwe see in this episode, yes,\n\n21\n00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.800\nis available on every distro.\n\n22\n00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.820\nBut one of the big bonuses or one of the,\nit's a positive and it's a negative\n\n23\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.420\nof Linux is that every distribution can\nchoose to do whatever the heck they want.\n\n24\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.190\nAnd so a lot of them have a standard set\nof administration tools that you can\n\n25\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.990\nexpect to find.\n\n26\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.420\nAnd you'll see them everywhere.\n\n27\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.870\nOther's don't, other's choose to\nhave their own management suite or\n\n28\n00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.914\neven proprietary software in some cases.\n\n29\n00:01:23.914 --> 00:01:28.439\nAnd so now you end up in the situation\nwhere you don't know what to expect, and\n\n30\n00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.420\nthat's why a lot of businesses will choose\none distribution and stick with it.\n\n31\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.670\nThey'll say we're gonna\nbe an Ubuntu shop or\n\n32\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.200\nwe're gonna be a Red Hat\nenterprise Linux shop.\n\n33\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.130\nAnd by doing that you have a consistent\nexperience with what you're\n\n34\n00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.320\ngoing to run into.\n\n35\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.100\nNow for a home user we don't\nthink about things like that,\n\n36\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.590\nif it's my own laptop I can put\nwhatever distro I want on here.\n\n37\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.770\nIt can be some crazy fly by night\ndistro that nobody's ever heard of,\n\n38\n00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.390\nit's not a big deal, but in a business,\nin an enterprise, that is a big concern.\n\n39\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.140\nSo we're gonna try and pick a consistent\ndesktop and learn the tools that\n\n40\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.080\nare available in it to be able to\nuse them to manage our systems.\n\n41\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, that makes sense.\n\n42\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.070\nIf you're just troubleshooting one\nsystem as that end user at home,\n\n43\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.330\nit's a lot easier than troubleshooting\nmultiple systems, right?\n\n44\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.110\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n45\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.250\nif you're trying to run commands on one\ncomputer to troubleshoot another one.\n\n46\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.850\nSo now you're working with\nmore than one system.\n\n47\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.040\nIt's nice to have it\nconsistent if you can.\n\n48\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.180\nSo that's where we end up on this one and\n\n49\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.030\nwe'll take a look at some of the different\nutilities that are available.\n\n50\n00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.730\nMost of them are pretty common sense.\n\n51\n00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.560\nYou'll stumble across them.\n\n52\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.390\nSome of them are hidden away.\n\n53\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.470\nSome of them for example are in the GUI,\nor have a GUI but don't have an icon so\n\n54\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.680\nwe don't have a way to go in and launch\nunless we absolutely know they're there,\n\n55\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.150\nthat makes those kind of tricky too.\n\n56\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.610\n&gt;&gt; How do we even know they're\nthere if the icon isn't present,\n\n57\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.370\nI mean, are we just going to be assuming\nor are they integrated into the system,\n\n58\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.105\nhow does that work?\n\n59\n00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:46.630\n&gt;&gt; So there's two answers to this one.\n\n60\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.565\n&gt;&gt; There's the smarmy answer,\nwhich is, you read the book, right?\n\n61\n00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:52.890\n[LAUGH] Every operating system\nthat they've got manuals.\n\n62\n00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.440\nThey've got documents that RTFM.\n\n63\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.820\nYou go and you read the manual.\n\n64\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.580\nBut some of them you can stumble through,\nand you can find.\n\n65\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.300\nSome of them are really consistent.\n\n66\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.330\nSo for example,\nI'm on a Red Hat machine here.\n\n67\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.540\nSo my laptop is running\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n68\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.140\nAnd if you're running Red Hat or\nCentOS or Fedora, those are all\n\n69\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.090\nbuilt off a common core, and they're very,\nvery common in the enterprise.\n\n70\n00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.190\nAnd Red Hat tries to make\ntheir systems easy to support,\n\n71\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.550\nwhether you've got a GUI or not.\n\n72\n00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.413\nAnd so one of the things they do, is they\nmake a lot of their configuration commands\n\n73\n00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.823\nall start with the same kind of verbage.\n\n74\n00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:31.380\nSo if I bring up a terminal,\nlet me fire up a terminal on my laptop.\n\n75\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.430\nSo here I am on my system and\nI've got this one and it says server but\n\n76\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.750\nserver workstation is all the same\nwhen it comes to this stuff.\n\n77\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.970\nThat I can run system-config and\njust hit tab a couple of times for\n\n78\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.740\nthe tab auto complete and I will\nstart to see some of these utilities.\n\n79\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.200\nNow, I can configure printers\nfrom the command line.\n\n80\n00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.528\nThat's not a big deal but\nthere's a GUI utility included right here,\n\n81\n00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:57.522\nsystem-config-printer.\n\n82\n00:03:57.522 --> 00:04:02.870\nAnd so that utility is there, it's\navailable for me and I can fire that up\n\n83\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.320\nand if I do, if I say, system- can,\nsorry, I've already got it on my screen.\n\n84\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.790\nI could save some time typing and\njust type printer.\n\n85\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.342\nSo system-config-printer and\nwhen I run that, up comes a GUI.\n\n86\n00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:17.869\nAnd now I'm able to see the printers\nthat I'm connected to and\n\n87\n00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.970\nI can manage them right\nhere in a graphical method.\n\n88\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.400\nSo I don't have to be some crazy command\nline wizard or remember a ton of things.\n\n89\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.030\nI can just type system-config,\nhit Tab a couple of times and\n\n90\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.480\nit'll show me all the ones that start.\n\n91\n00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.270\nNow, the list that I'm showing you\nhere is not terribly impressive.\n\n92\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.560\nIt's just printer and-\n&gt;&gt; I think it does help though,\n\n93\n00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.677\nit's not so intimidating.\n\n94\n00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:42.800\nIt's a good segway getting into\nthat command line interface there.\n\n95\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, but the other thing\nis that there's a lot more of these\n\n96\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.850\nutilities that just aren't\ninstalled by default.\n\n97\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.660\nYou may not have the graphical utility for\nsomething,\n\n98\n00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.730\nso I could actually\ninstall quite a few more.\n\n99\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.518\nIf I do a sudo yum install and\nthen specify some of\n\n100\n00:04:57.518 --> 00:05:03.164\nthe other GUI utilities\nlike system-config-users.\n\n101\n00:05:03.164 --> 00:05:07.750\nIf I fire that one up, it's gonna install\nthat and it's not installed by default,\n\n102\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.030\nbut it is available.\n\n103\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.570\nNow I can manage user accounts right here\nfrom the command line by using useradd,\n\n104\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.990\nusermod, those commands that if\nyou know the CLI, are available.\n\n105\n00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.850\nBut now that I've got this one\ninstalled I can do system-config, and\n\n106\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.980\nthere's that users showing up.\n\n107\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.065\nSo I can just type users.\n\n108\n00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:26.847\nSystem-config-users.\n\n109\n00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:30.133\nAnd now, whoop, I've gotta be\nan administrator to use this utility, so\n\n110\n00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.090\nit's prompting me.\n\n111\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.970\nSo that's nice,\nI didn't even have to remember that.\n\n112\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.980\nI can just run it, and there we go.\n\n113\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.940\nNow I'm able to come in here and\nmanage my user account.\n\n114\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.300\nI see that deep is the user account I'm\nlogged in with, and I can come in and\n\n115\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.150\ni can add more users and groups.\n\n116\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.780\nAll done right through a GUI.\n\n117\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.110\nAnd the list of utilities that are\navailable this way is really impressive.\n\n118\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.470\nWe could do a search\nthrough the repositories,\n\n119\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.010\nand you'll find where\nthere's tons of tools.\n\n120\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.950\nBut some of the more common ones, let's\nsay that I wanted to get this system set\n\n121\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.030\nup to be managed for the more common ones.\n\n122\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.455\nI might say sudo yum\ninstall system-config-*.\n\n123\n00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:08.440\nAnd when I do that I’m\nsaying install everyone.\n\n124\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.420\nNow I don’t want to install everyone,\n\n125\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.950\nit going to muck up the system with\nutilities that I don’t necessarily need.\n\n126\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.550\nThere are GUI utilities for managing\nresources that you might not be using.\n\n127\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.300\nFor example, if I don’t have a web server\ninstalled I don't need the GUI utility for\n\n128\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.010\nmanaging a web server.\n\n129\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.746\nBut when I run this command here it's\ngoing to give me a list of some of\n\n130\n00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:27.569\nthe ones out there.\n\n131\n00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.409\nAnd you'll see like system config for\nmanaging keyboard, for\n\n132\n00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.336\nmanaging your languages, if I scroll up\nwe'll see date for configuring the date\n\n133\n00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:41.130\non the system, for configuring\nthe firewall, that's kind of a nice one.\n\n134\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.030\nAnd this one's showing firewall base which\nmakes me think that I've got the main\n\n135\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.750\nfirewall one already installed.\n\n136\n00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.700\nBut each of these are just ways for\n\n137\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.800\nconfiguring various other\nresources in my system.\n\n138\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.970\nAnd If I install them, we can make\nuse of it, or here, I'll go ahead and\n\n139\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.500\ninstall them all.\n\n140\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.775\nWe'll throw caution to the wind.\n\n141\n00:06:57.775 --> 00:06:58.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n142\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.040\nonce that's installed, now I can start to\nwork with some of these other utilities.\n\n143\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.650\n&gt;&gt; And Don, the reason one\nof the main reasons would be\n\n144\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.653\nnot to install all of these, like you\nsaid to well, muck up your system.\n\n145\n00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:10.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you're also adding\n\n146\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.580\nadditional components.\n\n147\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.480\nAnd with the graphical user interface,\nwe're adding that additional coding.\n\n148\n00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.810\nAnd similarly to what we see in\nMicrosoft based operating systems,\n\n149\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.440\nwhere they offer that features on demand.\n\n150\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.550\nSo we're really just picking and\n\n151\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.400\nchoosing based on your\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n152\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.720\nHey, I'm only gonna be installing\nwhat's needed to run this system.\n\n153\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.500\nI don't want that extra coding because\nmaybe it'll slow down my system or\n\n154\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.430\nit could provide additional\nvulnerabilities.\n\n155\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.910\nSo those might be some of the reasons\nI would choose not to go ahead and\n\n156\n00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.830\ninstall all of these?\n\n157\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.949\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, all of the above,\nthat's all correct.\n\n158\n00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:44.130\nFor me I like to run a lean system.\n\n159\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.610\nI like to keep it with as little software\non it as necessary so I know it'll run\n\n160\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.650\nfast, and it'll run reliably, and\nthere's less for me to troubleshoot.\n\n161\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.649\nBut if I start installing\na ton of things on there,\n\n162\n00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:54.323\nit's probably not gonna hurt my system.\n\n163\n00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:59.653\nModern systems, they've got great CPUs,\nlots of memory, fast disk.\n\n164\n00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:03.850\nI've got tons of hard drive space on here,\nso I'm not hurting for disk space.\n\n165\n00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.765\nI could throw all these tools on here,\nit wouldn't be a big deal.\n\n166\n00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:09.038\nBut it does get a little confusing,\nsometimes when we go to troubleshoot.\n\n167\n00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.241\nAnd we go to look at things and\nother resources, so\n\n168\n00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.822\nit does become a bit of a challenge.\n\n169\n00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:18.550\nWhen it comes to these the other thing\nis you saw how fast it was to install.\n\n170\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.050\nI can always install the utility,\nuse it, and\n\n171\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.970\nthen remove it when I was done with it,\nif I don't need it laying around anymore.\n\n172\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.630\nSo you can do that.\n\n173\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.387\ntoo.\nThere's a few different options for\n\n174\n00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:29.170\nhow you wanna go about that.\n\n175\n00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.360\nAll right now, what I've showed you so\n\n176\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.750\nfar, are tools that start\nwith System-config.\n\n177\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.020\nAnd that's nice, especially in the Red Hat\nworld, there's a lot of utilities to do.\n\n178\n00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.970\nBut there's plenty of utilities that\ndon't start with system-config.\n\n179\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.740\nAnd if you're in the Ubuntu world,\nthe Debian based Operating Systems,\n\n180\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.860\nthey have a lot of utilities that aren't\nprefaced with that system-config.\n\n181\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.378\nThey have some that are, right, so\nthey follow it with some utilities.\n\n182\n00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:55.026\nBut other ones don't,\nlike the Network Manager, for example,\n\n183\n00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:57.250\ndoesn't start with system-config.\n\n184\n00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.510\nSo, for those utilities,\nyou will need to read the manual.\n\n185\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.401\nYou'll need to look at\nthe documentation for\n\n186\n00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.351\nthat distro to find what\ntools are available.\n\n187\n00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.310\nAnd fortunately, most of them,\nwe can find with an icon, right?\n\n188\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.840\nWhen you install the utility,\nan icon is added to the screen, and\n\n189\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.250\nso you just go up to\nyour application menu.\n\n190\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.040\nLike, if I go up here to my top left and\ngo to Applications, and\n\n191\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.820\nI come down here to System Tools.\n\n192\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.710\nThere is all of this stuff\nhere in System Tools, okay?\n\n193\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.339\nWhere do these come from?\n\n194\n00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:25.663\nWell, here's Kickstart,\nthat's actually system-config-kickstart.\n\n195\n00:09:25.663 --> 00:09:29.319\nSo if I run it from here in the icon,\nor if I go to my command prompt.\n\n196\n00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.797\nAnd run system/config/kickstart,\nthey're both gonna go the same place.\n\n197\n00:09:32.797 --> 00:09:37.400\nSo, I don't have to remember where it is\nin the CLI, I can just go right here.\n\n198\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.430\nAnd now the utility doesn't\nstart with system-config.\n\n199\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.700\nI'm okay with that.\n\n200\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.370\nThe boxes management utility does\nnot start with system-config.\n\n201\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.239\nBut I don't know that, I just see an icon,\nthis is boxes, I know what it is and\n\n202\n00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:49.350\nI can run it.\n\n203\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.880\n&gt;&gt; So this may be a silly question, but\nif we do decide to remove those utilities,\n\n204\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.153\nwill the icons be removed\nfrom that menu as well?\n\n205\n00:09:55.153 --> 00:09:58.342\n&gt;&gt; They're supposed to be, yes [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:09:58.342 --> 00:09:58.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n207\n00:09:58.922 --> 00:10:02.838\nmy experience has been that if you are\nrunning the default window interphase of\n\n208\n00:10:02.838 --> 00:10:05.406\nWindow Manager, then yes,\nthey'll be removed.\n\n209\n00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:09.498\nBut if you've changed from the default\nWindow Manager, which I do all the time,\n\n210\n00:10:09.498 --> 00:10:11.074\nthen it is a bit of a crap shoot.\n\n211\n00:10:11.074 --> 00:10:13.943\nThere is a Window Manager called XFCE-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was about to ask,\n\n212\n00:10:13.943 --> 00:10:15.490\nI don't know what Windows Manager is.\n\n213\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.741\nYou might have to break that down for me.\n\n214\n00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so when I logged into\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n215\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.403\nif you've never used\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux before.\n\n216\n00:10:23.403 --> 00:10:26.579\nBut you've used some other Linux, you\nmight have looked at this and said, wow,\n\n217\n00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:27.850\nthat's a little bit familiar.\n\n218\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.529\nThat looks like something\nthat I'm used to.\n\n219\n00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.500\nFor example,\nif I pull up my little super button there.\n\n220\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.630\nAnd I get my application\nlauncher on the left, and\n\n221\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.420\nmy virtual desktop manager on the right,\nthat's the Window Manager doing that.\n\n222\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.430\nAnd the Window Manager is separate\nfrom Linux, right, so in this case,\n\n223\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.070\nI'm running the Gnome Window Manager.\n\n224\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.420\nAnd I can run Gnome on Debian,\non Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n225\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.450\nI can run it on whatever.\n\n226\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.530\nAnd so now I've got these different\ndistros that all look the same.\n\n227\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.530\nBut, the underlying OS,\nthe underlying distro is different,\n\n228\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.650\nwhich means they may include some\nutilities and not include others.\n\n229\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.410\nAnd that can lead to\na little bit of confusion.\n\n230\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.627\nSo, some things are the same,\nsome things are different.\n\n231\n00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:07.840\nAnd if I change this Window Manager\nto something different like XFCE.\n\n232\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.590\nWhere it looks a little more like,\nalmost like Windows 95,\n\n233\n00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.515\nyou get your Start Button, and your little\nmenus like in the old Windows days.\n\n234\n00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:18.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which business is actually appreciate,\n\n235\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.390\nbecause it's less training for\ntheir users on the user interface.\n\n236\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.326\nI appreciate it because\nthere's less flash, right?\n\n237\n00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:25.969\nIt's less load it on the CPU,\nand all that,\n\n238\n00:11:25.969 --> 00:11:28.490\nso you get a faster response out of it.\n\n239\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.660\nBut now, when you install or\nremove an application,\n\n240\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.530\nit may not know to remove the icon\nfrom that particular Window Manager.\n\n241\n00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.980\nSo you do have to be careful with that.\n\n242\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.900\nBut as long as you're sticking with\nthe default, like Gnome, or Unity, or\n\n243\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.990\nwhatever, those icons, they'll come and\ngo with the administration tools.\n\n244\n00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.830\nAll right, another thing\nabout Window Managers though,\n\n245\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.450\nI guess it's worth mentioning here.\n\n246\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.760\nIs that a lot of Windows Managers will\ninclude their own management utilities.\n\n247\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.074\nAnd these might look like official\nutilities, but they actually aren't.\n\n248\n00:11:59.074 --> 00:12:03.800\nSo for example, Gnome has a Discs Manager\nthat's a part of it, right?\n\n249\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.630\nIf I go into my Applications up here,\nand I go into Utilities,\n\n250\n00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.820\nI can find a Utility called Discs.\n\n251\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.491\nAnd if I launch that up, I get,\na nice graphical disk management utility,\n\n252\n00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:17.765\nwhere I can see all of my\nhard drives on the left side.\n\n253\n00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:19.900\nI can see the partitioning\nscheme that I got laid out,\n\n254\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.243\nthe disk space I've available.\n\n255\n00:12:21.243 --> 00:12:25.070\nThis is a great utility,\nit's not a part of Red Hat.\n\n256\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.820\nIt's a part of Gnome.\n\n257\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.340\nAnd so, if I go to an Ubuntu system with\nthe Gnome UI, right, or I go to a Red Hat\n\n258\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.920\nsystem with the Gnome UI, or\nI go to Fedora, and I'm running Gnome.\n\n259\n00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.709\nThey'll all have this disk utility,\nand that's a great resource to have,\n\n260\n00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:42.501\nbecause now it's common\nacross the multiple distros.\n\n261\n00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:46.952\nIt's not the most powerful utility in the\nworld, right, it's actually kind of basic.\n\n262\n00:12:46.952 --> 00:12:50.648\nI can do things like format a hard drive,\nI can do some basic partitioning, but\n\n263\n00:12:50.648 --> 00:12:53.896\nI can't do things like LVM, and\nmanage the logical volume manager,\n\n264\n00:12:53.896 --> 00:12:55.301\nwhich you'll see down here.\n\n265\n00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:59.397\nI'm actually using the LVM, and this UI\ndoesn't really work all that well with it.\n\n266\n00:12:59.397 --> 00:13:02.500\nSo you'll bump into problems\nlike that from time to time.\n\n267\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.070\n&gt;&gt; It seems like it would be kind\nof convenient though if you're not\n\n268\n00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.550\nfamiliar with the different\nLinux distributions.\n\n269\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.260\nMaybe you just are familiar\nwith one particular version.\n\n270\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:17.380\nBut, having this utility,\nbeing able to use with different versions.\n\n271\n00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.210\nYou can say look,\nat least I know this utility.\n\n272\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.920\nAnd so I'm still able to go ahead and\nmanage this system, even\n\n273\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.330\nthough I might not be a hundred percent\nfamiliar with that Operating System.\n\n274\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nanything that makes it easier for\n\n275\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.860\nyou to transition from one to another.\n\n276\n00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.870\nAnd I do this stuff all the time,\n\n277\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.560\nwhere I'll go to somebody's system, and\nI don't know what distro they're running.\n\n278\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.450\nOr they're running some\ncrazy blacked out thing,\n\n279\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.270\njust because they thought\nit looked pretty.\n\n280\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.149\nAnd I want to go in and\nmess with the user account, and\n\n281\n00:13:40.149 --> 00:13:44.082\nI'll just bring up like I hit the super\nbutton, and type user, right?\n\n282\n00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:48.490\n[LAUGH] And hope it turns up something,\n[LAUGH] and if it does great.\n\n283\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.370\nAnd I can go into users and\ngroups or whatever.\n\n284\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.990\nNow, notice here I've actually\ngot two entries turning up.\n\n285\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.328\nOne that says users and groups,\nand one that says users.\n\n286\n00:13:56.328 --> 00:13:58.390\nThis is the challenge we bump into.\n\n287\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.791\nIs that if you have both the distros\nutility installed, and the Window Managers\n\n288\n00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:07.005\nutility installed, now you can have\nmore than one way to configure things.\n\n289\n00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:11.450\nSo when I go into Users, well,\nthat's the one that's a part of Gnome.\n\n290\n00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.417\nSo I'm saying Gnome's user\nmanagement right here.\n\n291\n00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:16.820\nOr actually, no, I've got that backwards,\nthat's the Red Hat one.\n\n292\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.915\nThe Gnome one actually shows the group,\nso if I go back into the other one.\n\n293\n00:14:21.915 --> 00:14:22.954\nSee how, now I'm getting confused.\n\n294\n00:14:22.954 --> 00:14:25.525\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, I wonder, so\nwould these conflict at all?\n\n295\n00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:27.415\nOr would one override\nthe other's settings?\n\n296\n00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:28.085\nOr how does that work?\n\n297\n00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:31.145\n&gt;&gt; They don't really conflict,\nbecause at the end of the day,\n\n298\n00:14:31.145 --> 00:14:35.215\nall the graphical user interface utilities\nwe have, are really just front-ending for\n\n299\n00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:36.975\ncommand line utilities in the background.\n\n300\n00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:40.455\nAnd so, they're accessing the same user\ndatabase, and the same password database,\n\n301\n00:14:40.455 --> 00:14:42.005\nand the same areas on the backend.\n\n302\n00:14:42.005 --> 00:14:44.390\nSo, that's really all the same.\n\n303\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.700\nAll that's different\nreally are the features.\n\n304\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.790\nIf you look at these two utilities,\nthey're both available for managing users.\n\n305\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.920\nThe one on the left is the one\nfrom Red Hat, and the one,\n\n306\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.782\nor actually I do have it backwards, shoot.\n\n307\n00:14:54.782 --> 00:14:56.365\n[LAUGH] The one on the left\nis the one from Gnome, and\n\n308\n00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:57.780\nthe one on the right is from Red Hat.\n\n309\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.188\nI'm getting them mixed up.\n\n310\n00:14:59.188 --> 00:15:03.870\nBut in the Red Hat one, notice how I\ncan add users, and I can add groups.\n\n311\n00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.110\nI see my user account right here,\nI can also manage the groups from here.\n\n312\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.040\nI can delete them, and\nchange them on the left,\n\n313\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.550\nI'm just seeing the user accounts, and\nmanaging that, not managing groups.\n\n314\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.353\nAnd that's because for a Window Manager,\nWindow Managers don't care about groups.\n\n315\n00:15:18.353 --> 00:15:22.919\nWindow Managers wanna make sure that\nuser A has their desktop background, and\n\n316\n00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.170\ntheir screen saver.\n\n317\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.900\nAnd user B has their own desktop\nbackground, and their own home folder.\n\n318\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.597\nThat's what Window Managers care about.\n\n319\n00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:32.472\nVersus your Operating System that\ncares about permissions, and\n\n320\n00:15:32.472 --> 00:15:34.130\nthings natural groups come in.\n\n321\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.312\nSo really seeing two different views.\n\n322\n00:15:35.312 --> 00:15:39.740\nAnd one is more complex than the other,\nbut they both have a similar feature set.\n\n323\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.530\nBecause the one on the left\nis geared toward users,\n\n324\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.560\nI'll see things like the ability to go in\nand reset their password, or whatever.\n\n325\n00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.770\nAnd on the right, I actually have to edit\nthat user before I start to see those\n\n326\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.630\noptions, and then I can see it here.\n\n327\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.460\nIt's a little less user friendly,\nbut it's way more powerful.\n\n328\n00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.630\nSo you'll find, you develop a preference\nfor certain utilities over other ones.\n\n329\n00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.165\nAnd you won't just stay married to\njust what's in the Gnome UI, or\n\n330\n00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:05.141\nwhat's in the The Red Hat Distro, you\nwill kind of find a mixture of both and\n\n331\n00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:06.233\nwhat works for you.\n\n332\n00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:11.114\nNow, there are plenty of these utilities\nthat are kind of spread throughout\n\n333\n00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:11.960\nthe system.\n\n334\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.130\nAnd again some of them are installed\nby default and some of them are not.\n\n335\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.260\nSo you may have to\nexperiment around a bit.\n\n336\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.820\nI showed with the Red Hat ones\nwhere I might drop to a shell and\n\n337\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:29.900\ndo a yum install system-config-* to\nget a list of what it was all there.\n\n338\n00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.350\nI could even do a yum list and\nfind them that way.\n\n339\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.575\nThe Gnome utilities and on the other\nutilities that don't start with\n\n340\n00:16:37.575 --> 00:16:40.200\nsystem-config, they're much,\nmuch harder to find.\n\n341\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.530\nYou really have to know\nthat they're there.\n\n342\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.060\nSo let me just highlight\na few that are kind of handy.\n\n343\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.130\nIn the Gnome world,\nthere's the Gnome-utils and\n\n344\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.060\nthe Gnome Tweak utility and\nthe Gnome configuration editor.\n\n345\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.930\nThose are the three really handy ones for\n\n346\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.850\nconfiguring the way that\na desktop is presented to users.\n\n347\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.240\nAnd in the business world,\nthe Gnome desktop is king.\n\n348\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.910\nThat is what you're gonna see\non every business desktop.\n\n349\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.450\nA lot of home users run Ubuntu and\nUbuntu defaults to the Unity interface.\n\n350\n00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.130\nWell even Canonical,\nthe people who make Ubuntu, came out and\n\n351\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.400\nannounced they're killing off Unity.\n\n352\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.273\nSo you don't see that in the business\nworld because Gnome has been around\n\n353\n00:17:14.273 --> 00:17:14.800\na long time.\n\n354\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.902\nAnd so it's stable.\n\n355\n00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:19.852\nThey know it's gonna be there and\nthey're not ready to take chances so\n\n356\n00:17:19.852 --> 00:17:21.550\nit's a good idea to learn this one.\n\n357\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.490\nIf you bring up your application menu.\n\n358\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.230\nAnd you go down and take a look through\nthe tools, you can stumble upon some of\n\n359\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.490\nthese, just kind of buried in the settings\nsoftware, if I go into there.\n\n360\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.110\nBut most of them don't\nshow up very obviously,\n\n361\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.887\nthey make it kind of hard to see.\n\n362\n00:17:36.887 --> 00:17:40.359\nSo if you just use your super button,\n\n363\n00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:45.680\nyour Windows key and\nyou can type conf in the search.\n\n364\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.890\nYou'll pull up a few different\nutilities that come up,\n\n365\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.730\nand the dconf editor is one\nthat I wanted to highlight.\n\n366\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.060\nThe dconf editor shows\na lot of hidden settings.\n\n367\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.000\nWhen you go to the regular settings\nutility, you're seeing settings\n\n368\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.400\nthat every user is expected to use,\nand they're somewhat limited.\n\n369\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.670\nBut when you go into dconf\neditor you're actually seeing\n\n370\n00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.620\nthe entire configuration database.\n\n371\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.640\nLet me show you the difference.\n\n372\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.320\nAnd when I go into settings, so I'm just\ngonna fire up the normal settings utility.\n\n373\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.540\nI get a nice selection of icons.\n\n374\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.650\nI can pick what I wanna configure.\n\n375\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.340\nI can go in, I wanna see displays.\n\n376\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.740\nAnd here's my display settings and\nI can pull those up.\n\n377\n00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.918\nAnd I can start to work with them.\nSo that's typical average, regular user\n\n378\n00:18:23.918 --> 00:18:29.010\ntype stuff or maybe power user\na little bit, but mostly regular user.\n\n379\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.129\nBut if we go into that dconf editor,\n\n380\n00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:34.953\nwhen we go in there,what we see\nis the configuration database.\n\n381\n00:18:34.953 --> 00:18:37.995\nAnd I actually don't have it installed so\nit is offering to install it for me so\n\n382\n00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:39.350\nI'll do that real quick.\n\n383\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.660\nBut what you'll see is this little,\nthe screen shot here is showing it,\n\n384\n00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:49.020\nis a navigable menu tree on the left side\nand every option laid out on the right.\n\n385\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.450\nIf you are coming from the Windows world,\n\n386\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.395\nthis will be equivalent of going\ninto the registry in Windows.\n\n387\n00:18:53.395 --> 00:18:54.585\n&gt;&gt; I was just about to ask that.\n\n388\n00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:58.010\nYou looked at the other screen, and it\nlooks very similar to Control Panel, but\n\n389\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.941\nthen, taking it a step further,\nwhat would be comparable to that?\n\n390\n00:19:00.941 --> 00:19:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's kind of what\nwe're seeing here, is the registry.\n\n391\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.700\nThe difference between the Unix and\nLinux configurations and\n\n392\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.290\nthe Windows Registry is,\nthe Windows Registry is one big database.\n\n393\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.570\nBut in the Unix and\n\n394\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.880\nLinux world, your configuration is\nactually spread out across hundreds and\n\n395\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.730\neven thousands of configuration files,\nthese individual text files.\n\n396\n00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.800\nAnd they're just text.\n\n397\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.300\nI could drop to a command line editor and\nedit them.\n\n398\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.860\nIf I can find the right one and\n\n399\n00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.450\nknew what to type it becomes really,\nreally challenging.\n\n400\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.430\nBut with a GUI like the dconf editor,\nI can fire it up, which will\n\n401\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.440\nactually launch this time since it's\ninstalled, that does make a difference.\n\n402\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.859\nAnd then I can navigate in here and\n\n403\n00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.809\nI can configure things like the desktop,\nor the system or whatever.\n\n404\n00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:44.192\nAnd I can start to see a lot of more\nsettings in here that dictate how this\n\n405\n00:19:44.192 --> 00:19:49.390\ncomputer works and what it does and\nall the different functions inside of it.\n\n406\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:54.560\nAll kind of spread throughout here as\nI dig into some of these settings.\n\n407\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.600\nWe'll find some different things,\nlike here for Boxes utility.\n\n408\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.410\nLet me zoom in on that a little bit,\nthere.\n\n409\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.930\nSo we can see the screen shot interval.\n\n410\n00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.350\nOr whether the window is maximize.\n\n411\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.340\nThe window position,\nthese kind of settings.\n\n412\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.010\nAnd this is stuff that's very difficult to\nfind in the configuration file, but for\n\n413\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.540\nme, it's right here.\n\n414\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.400\nI can get out, I can change it, and\n\n415\n00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.290\nthere's some basic syntax verification\nto make sure I don't do mistakes.\n\n416\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.210\nBut you can make mistakes in here,\n\n417\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.120\nthat's the other challenge with these\nadministrative utilities, is that the more\n\n418\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.940\npower they give you, the more ability\nthey give you to screw things up.\n\n419\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of times in a Windows\nenvironment you'll get a notification kind\n\n420\n00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.340\nof like, hey,\nyou're about to ruin everything.\n\n421\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.383\nDo you wanna proceed, yes or no?\n\n422\n00:20:32.383 --> 00:20:34.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do we get those kind of notifications\n\n423\n00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:34.940\nhere, or no?\n\n424\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.863\n&gt;&gt; No, no you don't.\n\n425\n00:20:35.863 --> 00:20:37.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n426\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.840\n&gt;&gt; When you launch it you are in there and\nstarting to really mess with things.\n\n427\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.150\nAnd you can cause some problems.\n\n428\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.410\nYou can get into a situation where\nyou've managed to lock yourself out or\n\n429\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.370\nyou break it.\n\n430\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.042\nSo if you've got backups you can restore,\nyou can roll back to sometimes, but\n\n431\n00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:52.109\nit can be really challenging.\n\n432\n00:20:52.109 --> 00:20:55.102\nI usually recommend having a second\nuser account on your computer so\n\n433\n00:20:55.102 --> 00:20:57.411\nif you mess something up\nreally bad on the first one,\n\n434\n00:20:57.411 --> 00:21:00.562\nthe second user account will have\ntheir own configuration settings for\n\n435\n00:21:00.562 --> 00:21:04.000\nthe Window manager at least, and\nyou can get in and go that way.\n\n436\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.170\nThere are some other utilities,\nlike the Gnome Tweak Tool, which again,\n\n437\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.320\nif you just hit your super key and\n\n438\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.730\ntype tweak, it'll turn up that\nGnome Tweak Tool, if it's installed.\n\n439\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.840\nAnd these are additional tweaks.\n\n440\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.980\nThese are a lot safer.\n\n441\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.610\nThis is really just tweaking\nthe appearance and behavior of Gnome.\n\n442\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.440\nWhen Gnome 3 came out,\na lot of people didn't like it.\n\n443\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.140\nThey liked Gnome 2 better.\n\n444\n00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.880\nAnd you can actually come in\nhere to the Gnome Tweak Tool and\n\n445\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.660\nturn off all the Gnome3 features and\nit looks exactly like Gnome 2.\n\n446\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.610\nExcept you get all the security fixes and\nperformance improvements, and\n\n447\n00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.520\nall that of Gnome 3.\n\n448\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.420\nSo you can customize\nthis to match your needs.\n\n449\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.573\nAnd that's another handy thing to be able\nto do, especially when you're supporting\n\n450\n00:21:40.573 --> 00:21:42.734\nusers that might not be ready for\nthe latest and greatest.\n\n451\n00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:45.384\nAs IT people,\nwe love to run the latest and greatest.\n\n452\n00:21:45.384 --> 00:21:50.230\nWe run betas, we wanna run alphas, and\ndo that just as a matter of course.\n\n453\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.450\nBut for our regular end user?\n\n454\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.682\nMaybe you work at a bank and\nyou're supporting tellers.\n\n455\n00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:58.620\nThey wanna be able to sit down and\ntake deposits and\n\n456\n00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.430\nallow people to withdraw funds.\n\n457\n00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.410\nThat's what they wanna do.\n\n458\n00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.300\nThat's what a teller needs\nto do throughout the day.\n\n459\n00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.930\nThey don't need the latest and\n\n460\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.650\ngreatest feature out of the Fedora Alpha\nor whatever, they need stability.\n\n461\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.620\nAnd so being able to create that kind\nof environment with tools like these\n\n462\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.090\nare really handy as well.\n\n463\n00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.180\nThese are not part of\nthe operating system,\n\n464\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.240\nthe core distro,\nthese are part of the window manager.\n\n465\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.950\nIf I were to switch window managers\nI wouldn't have the Gnome tweak tool.\n\n466\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.040\nOr I might have it, it just wouldn't\ndo anything right because I'm not\n\n467\n00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.920\nrunning Gnome anymore.\n\n468\n00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.839\nSo always be aware that these tools\nreally start to vary quite a bit.\n\n469\n00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:33.885\n&gt;&gt; So aside from our operating\nsystem integrated and\n\n470\n00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:38.383\nour Windows manager integrated tools\nare there any third party tools that\n\n471\n00:22:38.383 --> 00:22:41.806\nyou would recommend or\neven just suggest considering?\n\n472\n00:22:41.806 --> 00:22:43.440\n&gt;&gt; There's a ton.\n\n473\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.550\nThere are a lot of other\nutilities out there.\n\n474\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.770\nAnd actually, there's a bit of\na movement out there right now for\n\n475\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.620\nweb based management utilities.\n\n476\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.370\nAnd these are actually pretty convenient.\n\n477\n00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.530\nIt's not a new thing.\n\n478\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.870\nWeb management utilities have\nbeen around a long, long time.\n\n479\n00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.140\nBut it's just in the last few years\nthey're becoming really popular.\n\n480\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.910\nIf you go online to a cloud service and\n\n481\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.940\nyou rent a Linux server, a lot of times\nthey'll give you what's called a cPanel.\n\n482\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.870\nAnd cPanel is a webpage you go\nto that allows you to manage\n\n483\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.610\nall the administrative\nfunctions on that system.\n\n484\n00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.760\nYou can do that on your\nown computer too though.\n\n485\n00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.430\nThere's software out there like,\nhere, let me show you, Webmin.\n\n486\n00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.557\nWebmin is one,\nwho has a very small webpage.\n\n487\n00:23:21.557 --> 00:23:25.284\n[LAUGH] And you go to their webpage,\nthey tell you all about this product, and\n\n488\n00:23:25.284 --> 00:23:28.546\nbasically it can be installed on Red Hat,\nin Debian, in Ubuntu and\n\n489\n00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:29.844\nall these other distros.\n\n490\n00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:32.130\nAnd it gives you a webpage.\n\n491\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.250\nYou go to the manager system.\n\n492\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.400\nCockpit is another one.\n\n493\n00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.330\nCockpit is similar,\n\n494\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.720\nexcept it doesn't stress configuration\nas much as it does monitoring.\n\n495\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.700\nIt gives you a good view of your system,\nand you can configure a few things, but\n\n496\n00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.300\na lot of it is really built more around\njust kind of monitoring that performance.\n\n497\n00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.885\nBut let me,\nlet me show you Webmin real quick,\n\n498\n00:23:52.885 --> 00:23:57.334\nI know we're running low on time but-\n&gt;&gt; So Don, do these pieces of software\n\n499\n00:23:57.334 --> 00:24:01.315\ncoincide with the ideology\nof free [CROSSTALK]\n\n500\n00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:02.256\n&gt;&gt; Some of them do.\n\n501\n00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:05.382\nSo cPanel is expensive.\n\n502\n00:24:05.382 --> 00:24:09.397\nIt's a purchase program, it costs a lot,\nyou have to pay an annual fee for it.\n\n503\n00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.545\nBut it's because you get support for\nthat, right?\n\n504\n00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:13.119\nSo they help and support you.\n\n505\n00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.960\nOther utilities like Webmin,\none I've got pulled up right here.\n\n506\n00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.399\nWebmin is free.\n\n507\n00:24:17.399 --> 00:24:18.484\nYou can go and download it.\n\n508\n00:24:18.484 --> 00:24:22.072\nI installed it before the show,\ndidn't pay a dime.\n\n509\n00:24:22.072 --> 00:24:25.217\nAnd when you go into it,\nit lets you manage your server.\n\n510\n00:24:25.217 --> 00:24:28.980\nAnd a group of independent people\nsupport this and develop for it.\n\n511\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.718\nAnd that means it might not\nwork perfectly, which is,\n\n512\n00:24:31.718 --> 00:24:35.270\nif we go back to what you said,\nare there tools that I recommend?\n\n513\n00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.060\nWell, I don't really recommend these\ntools on production servers because, one,\n\n514\n00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.200\nthey're not perfect, right?\n\n515\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.790\nThey do have their flaws.\n\n516\n00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.940\nAnd two, there could be security\nweaknesses that you're introducing, right?\n\n517\n00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.940\nThis is a webpage that I browse to.\n\n518\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.020\nI browsed to localhost:10000, right?\n\n519\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.510\nJust port 10000 on my own machine,\nand here is this web server running.\n\n520\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.870\nAnd I had to log in, I had to\nprovide a username and a password.\n\n521\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.110\nBut once you're in, now you got\naccess to this web application.\n\n522\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.160\nWell, was it secured?\n\n523\n00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.280\nDid they do a security audit on it?\n\n524\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:02.800\nI'm not sure.\n\n525\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.330\nMaybe they did, maybe they posted\nthat on a site we could go and see.\n\n526\n00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.680\nBut it is increasing the attack\nsurface of your server.\n\n527\n00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.454\nBut for a workstation, like from my own\nmachine, I'll run these cuz it's easier.\n\n528\n00:25:12.454 --> 00:25:15.737\nIf I want to go in and mess with\na service or configure a hard drive or\n\n529\n00:25:15.737 --> 00:25:18.186\nsomething like that,\nI can come right in here and\n\n530\n00:25:18.186 --> 00:25:20.780\nI've got where I can configure hardware,\nright?\n\n531\n00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.860\nSo I wanna configure my system time.\n\n532\n00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.130\nI can jump right in here, and\n\n533\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.560\nI don't have to remember\nsystem-config-date to fire that up.\n\n534\n00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.850\nI can just come in here under Hardware and\nSystem Time,\n\n535\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:33.608\nand I can pull it up, and,\nit's running a little bit slow.\n\n536\n00:25:33.608 --> 00:25:38.220\n[LAUGH] But eventually I'll get there and\nbe able to adjust the time on my system.\n\n537\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.070\nI can pull up my dashboard to monitor it,\nI can do other things, there we go.\n\n538\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.400\nSo now I can pull up my system and\nadjust that.\n\n539\n00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.160\nI've got the hardware time, which is\nwhat's being stored on my motherboard and\n\n540\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.040\nmy BIOS.\n\n541\n00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.770\nAnd my system time, which hopefully\nare the same, but aren't always, and so\n\n542\n00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.140\nwe might need to adjust and\ntweak those settings.\n\n543\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.060\nWe can do all that right here\nfrom a web-based utility.\n\n544\n00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.350\nThat makes life easy.\n\n545\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.477\nAnd these are ones I had to install.\n\n546\n00:26:00.477 --> 00:26:02.106\nWebmin is not installed by default.\n\n547\n00:26:02.106 --> 00:26:04.250\nCockpit is not installed by default.\n\n548\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.720\nBut there are some that\nare installed by default.\n\n549\n00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.520\nIf you just install Ubuntu right now,\nor Red Hat, like I did.\n\n550\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.790\nThe print system is called CUPS,\nthe Common Unix Printing Subsystem.\n\n551\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.220\nAnd CUPS has a web management interface.\n\n552\n00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.190\nA lot of people don't realize that,\nthey never use it.\n\n553\n00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.662\nBut if you browse to localhost.\n\n554\n00:26:21.662 --> 00:26:27.204\nLet me browse to http I'm gonna try and\n\n555\n00:26:27.204 --> 00:26:30.878\nbrowse to http://localhost:631.\n\n556\n00:26:30.878 --> 00:26:32.081\nSo port 631.\n\n557\n00:26:32.081 --> 00:26:35.341\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, do we have to go in and\nmodify the firewall settings here for\n\n558\n00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:36.950\nusing these specific ports?\n\n559\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.850\n&gt;&gt; Not in this case,\ncuz it's local host, right?\n\n560\n00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.460\nI'm on the machine so I'm not actually\npassing through the firewall at all.\n\n561\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.420\nAnd the default firewall rule\nshould block access to this page.\n\n562\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.065\nSo not just anybody on the network can\ncome and access my printer system,\n\n563\n00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:50.760\nat least we hope, right?\n\n564\n00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.800\nYou could always double check that.\n\n565\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.305\nGo into your firewall utilities and\ndouble-check.\n\n566\n00:26:53.305 --> 00:26:54.913\nBut it should be blocked.\n\n567\n00:26:54.913 --> 00:26:58.297\nBut here, we've got web\nmanagement that's enabled for\n\n568\n00:26:58.297 --> 00:27:00.985\nme to manage my own\nprinters via the web page.\n\n569\n00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:02.512\nNow, I don't normally do that.\n\n570\n00:27:02.512 --> 00:27:05.500\nI've got the printer's utility, and\nthat's the way that I go about it.\n\n571\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.020\nBut right here is a web\nmanagement utility, and\n\n572\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.800\nthis is nice because it's common across\nany operating system that's running CUPS.\n\n573\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.090\nBut it's not so\nnice in that it is a web page.\n\n574\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:15.630\nIt's open.\n\n575\n00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.260\nIt's running.\n\n576\n00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.710\nIt's on port 631.\n\n577\n00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.190\nThis is part of the service, and\n\n578\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.720\nthat means it's consuming resources and\npotentially increasing the attack surface.\n\n579\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.000\nSo you always wanna be\ncareful with these utilities.\n\n580\n00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.460\nIf you're not going to use them,\nyou should disable them.\n\n581\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.060\nYou can disable this web interface in\nCUPS, and you can also just block it on\n\n582\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.568\nthe firewall so it's available just for\nyou and not for everybody else.\n\n583\n00:27:34.568 --> 00:27:38.601\nThose are all things to consider when\nyou use web utilities like these.\n\n584\n00:27:38.601 --> 00:27:40.603\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nI think that's about it for this show.\n\n585\n00:27:40.603 --> 00:27:43.570\nDo you have any final thoughts or\nanything that you'd like to add?\n\n586\n00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.270\n&gt;&gt; So the main thing here is there's\nno right and wrong tool to use.\n\n587\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.690\nWhen it comes to the graphical utilities,\njust find the ones that you like.\n\n588\n00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.750\nI showed the GNOME utility for\nmodifying disks and how easy it looked.\n\n589\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.250\nThere's actually another\nutility called GParted.\n\n590\n00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.960\nIt's a graphical partition editor,\nand that's what I normally use for\n\n591\n00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.780\nmodifying disks.\n\n592\n00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.070\nIt's not installed by default,\nyou have to install it.\n\n593\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.100\nAnd I found that that's the tool that\nI prefer for working with disks.\n\n594\n00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.020\nThat's what I like.\n\n595\n00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.900\nAnd for you, you may find the same.\n\n596\n00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.037\nFind utilities that you like, ones that\nwork for you, and just stick with those.\n\n597\n00:28:12.037 --> 00:28:15.913\nAnd you'll find that you can do full\nsystem administration just using graphical\n\n598\n00:28:15.913 --> 00:28:16.597\nutilities and\n\n599\n00:28:16.597 --> 00:28:20.595\nnot the command line, which is what we're\ngonna see in most of our other episodes.\n\n600\n00:28:20.595 --> 00:28:22.844\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for taking the time\nto show us a lot of these tools.\n\n601\n00:28:22.844 --> 00:28:24.533\nAnd I think it's great especially for\n\n602\n00:28:24.533 --> 00:28:27.756\nsomeone maybe comfortable or\nfamiliar with the Windows environment and\n\n603\n00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:30.310\nthey're not ready to make\nthat full transition or leap.\n\n604\n00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.599\nBut now they have the tools\nto get them on their way.\n\n605\n00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:33.758\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for that.\n\n606\n00:28:33.758 --> 00:28:35.218\nAnd thank you for joining us today.\n\n607\n00:28:35.218 --> 00:28:38.070\nBut stay tuned, we have additional\ninformation headed your way.\n\n608\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.468\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n609\n00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:41.249\nAs your host, I've been Cherokee Boose.\n\n610\n00:28:41.249 --> 00:28:42.267\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n611\n00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:45.345\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n612\n00:28:45.345 --> 00:28:51.031\n[MUSIC]\n\n613\n00:28:51.031 -->

00:00:07.904\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:10.802\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.263\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Becoming\na Linux system admin series,\n\n6\n00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:17.175\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.403\nIn this episode we're gonna\nbe taking a look at well,\n\n8\n00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:22.427\nhow to use the root user account.\n\n9\n00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:25.752\nAnd back in the studios with us\ntoday we have mister Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:26.802\nHow's it going today Don?\n\n11\n00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:27.962\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.230\nI'm excited to jump back into\nour Linux system admin track.\n\n13\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.464\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at the root user account.\n\n14\n00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:34.832\nLike Cherokee mentioned,\n\n15\n00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:38.982\nit is a very important account that\nunfortunately gets misused way too much.\n\n16\n00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:42.052\nSo we're gonna spend our time here in this\nepisode talking about when we would use\n\n17\n00:00:42.052 --> 00:00:45.012\nit, why we would use it, how we're\nintended to use that root user account and\n\n18\n00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.022\nwhat its purpose is.\n\n19\n00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:49.254\nAnd we'll get a chance to see all of\nthat in the scope of Linux system\n\n20\n00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:51.237\nadministration right in this episode.\n\n21\n00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:52.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds great, Don.\n\n22\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.433\nI think the first question would be,\nlike you have mentioned,\n\n23\n00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.361\nwho should be using this root account?\n\n24\n00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.996\n&gt;&gt; Well, so root user account\nit's really intended just, why,\n\n25\n00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.808\nit's just kinda hard to say,\nit's intended for\n\n26\n00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:09.260\nsystem administrators is for us, but it's\nreally intended for the system itself.\n\n27\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.225\nWhen your computer boots up a lot of the\nactivities that it performs in the very\n\n28\n00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:15.482\nbeginning when it's initially starting,\n\n29\n00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:18.730\nare being performed under\nthe permission set of the root user.\n\n30\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.360\nRoot user is actually the very first\nuser account created on your system.\n\n31\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.431\nWhen you install a Linux system the root\nuser account is created right there at\n\n32\n00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:26.290\nthe very beginning.\n\n33\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.160\nAnd this is from way\nback in the Unix days.\n\n34\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.330\nThat account has always been there.\n\n35\n00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.880\nAnd this user has full permission,\n\n36\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.880\nfull access to every single\nresource across your system.\n\n37\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.780\nThey can do anything.\n\n38\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.811\nYou can't lock the user account out.\n\n39\n00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.468\nYou can't stop them from accessing\na file by changing permissions.\n\n40\n00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:46.148\nIt's a very, very powerful account.\n\n41\n00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:51.106\nAnd as a result if we need to perform\nsome activity or action that requires\n\n42\n00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:55.678\nelevated privileges, we can use\nthe root user account to do that.\n\n43\n00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:58.536\nA regular user account,\na regular end user,\n\n44\n00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.630\nsomebody who is just a home user whatever.\n\n45\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.212\nProbably shouldn't be using the root\nuser account on a regular basis.\n\n46\n00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:06.770\nBut there are times where\nwe need to have that.\n\n47\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.971\nLike when we are installing software or\n\n48\n00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.410\nwe're installing hardware\ndrivers things like that.\n\n49\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.532\nThose are very important tasks that modify\nthe way the operating system works.\n\n50\n00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:18.596\nAnd that's what that root\nuser account is intended for.\n\n51\n00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:22.783\nSo those are kinda some scenarios where we\nmight actually see that user account get\n\n52\n00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:23.880\nput into play.\n\n53\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.450\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like we should use some\ndiscretion whenever we do allow use of\n\n54\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.933\nthis particular account\nbecause of potential,\n\n55\n00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:33.034\nit sounds like potential\nsecurity risks that could happen.\n\n56\n00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:37.082\nSo would our sysadmins be using a root\naccount for management purposes?\n\n57\n00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:40.370\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is where things get a little weird.\n\n58\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.579\nOn the internet, [LAUGH] If we go and\nlearn from the internet, you\n\n59\n00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:52.360\ncan find forum posts all over the place\nwhere people will say, log in as root.\n\n60\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.510\nOr access a root shell and\nstart doing commands.\n\n61\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.164\nYou can log in as root.\n\n62\n00:02:56.164 --> 00:02:59.800\nI can log into my own laptop as root,\nbut I don't.\n\n63\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.790\nAs any user, really,\neven if you're a system administrator,\n\n64\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.590\nif you're the person who owns the company,\nyou shouldn't be logging in as root.\n\n65\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.080\nYou should be logging in as you.\n\n66\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.862\nEverybody should have a regular\nrun-of-the-mill user account.\n\n67\n00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:17.050\nAnd then you just use the root\naccount when you need to, right?\n\n68\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.060\nThe problem with logging in as root is\nthat when you log in as the root user,\n\n69\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.750\neverything you do,\n\n70\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.375\nfrom the most powerful administration\ntasks down to the most menial,\n\n71\n00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:32.800\nrun-of-the-mill, monotonous task is being\nrun with full system privileges, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.040\nHave you ever accidentally deleted a file.\n\n73\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.238\nAnd you're like I didn't\nmean to delete that.\n\n74\n00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:38.830\nAnd you go to the Recycle Bin and\nyou pull it back.\n\n75\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.380\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n76\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.656\nWell, those are mistakes, they happen.\n\n77\n00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.073\nAs a regular user if you try and\n\n78\n00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:47.328\ndo something really bad you don't\nhave permission, it stops you.\n\n79\n00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:52.738\nIf you go to delete the /sys folder or\n/boot folder it won't let you.\n\n80\n00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:53.892\nYou don't have permissions.\n\n81\n00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:55.874\nBut as the root user, it will let you.\n\n82\n00:03:55.874 --> 00:03:58.760\nAnd if you delete the /boot folder,\nguess what your system won't do?\n\n83\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.855\nBoot.\n\n84\n00:03:59.855 --> 00:04:01.670\n[LAUGH] It's a bad thing.\n\n85\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.714\nSo, as the root user,\nif you're logged in that way,\n\n86\n00:04:04.714 --> 00:04:06.960\nyou have the ability to make mistakes.\n\n87\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.000\nAnd, it's not even you making the mistake.\n\n88\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.714\nReally, there's other\nthings that can happen.\n\n89\n00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:13.048\nDrive-by web installations.\n\n90\n00:04:13.048 --> 00:04:17.118\nYou go to a website, and the website\nhas some malicious flash plug-in or\n\n91\n00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:22.300\nActiveX java script, whatever thing you\nknow, and it tries to do something bad.\n\n92\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.894\nIf you're logged in as a regular user,\nit can't do that right?\n\n93\n00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:29.056\nIt tries to do run, it's running in\nyour user account's privilege space, and\n\n94\n00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:30.308\nit can't do anything.\n\n95\n00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:33.612\nBut if you're logged in as root and\nyou go to a malicious website and\n\n96\n00:04:33.612 --> 00:04:36.149\nit runs some drive by attack,\nguess what the attack\n\n97\n00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:39.986\nis running as root cuz it's running as\nyou, you're the one who launched it.\n\n98\n00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:42.760\nAnd now it can do whatever it wants.\n\n99\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.720\nThat's the risk we have but\nyou certainly log in as root.\n\n100\n00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.540\nSo for example here on my laptop I'm\nlogged into my desktop here as me,\n\n101\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.780\nso if I do a whoami,\nI'm dpezet, that's great.\n\n102\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.820\nI can switch to another console and\nthis is gonna be really small,\n\n103\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.710\ncuz at the console level I can't\nincrease the font size, right?\n\n104\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.178\nI'm at a hardware console.\n\n105\n00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:03.745\nAnd I could come in here and\nI could log in as root and\n\n106\n00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:07.120\nI can punch in the password and\ngain access to the system, right?\n\n107\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.262\nAnd I would then have a shell\naccount logged in as the root user.\n\n108\n00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:13.246\nNow, I'm not gonna do it because, well,\n\n109\n00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.890\nI can't actually remember\nwhat my root password is.\n\n110\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.024\nWhich you might think is kinda funny.\n\n111\n00:05:17.024 --> 00:05:20.310\nDon, why don't you know the root\npassword to your own system?\n\n112\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.034\nAnd the short answer is I don't\nknow it because I never use it.\n\n113\n00:05:24.034 --> 00:05:27.316\nI don't use the root user account\nbecause as a good system administrator,\n\n114\n00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:28.500\nyou really shouldn't.\n\n115\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.242\nBut, you do need to be\naware that it is there and\n\n116\n00:05:30.242 --> 00:05:32.298\nwe can use it a different way and\nlater in this episode,\n\n117\n00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.962\nI'll show you how you actually can\nuse that, that root user account.\n\n118\n00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:39.076\nThe other thing is,\nif I were back at my GUI, for example, and\n\n119\n00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:42.020\nI wanted to log in as\na different user right?\n\n120\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.380\nSo I could log out and\nswitch to somebody else right?\n\n121\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.780\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\ntry and log in as a different user.\n\n122\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.403\nWell, at that log in screen, I guess it\nkinda came and went really fast there, but\n\n123\n00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:57.300\nyou saw for just a brief moment\nthere where it showed dpezet, right?\n\n124\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.964\nSo it showed as me.\n\n125\n00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:01.680\nWell, it didn't show root.\n\n126\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.240\nThe root user account is actually\nhidden from most window managers.\n\n127\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.301\nAnd they don't want you to log into\nthe window manager as root because well,\n\n128\n00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:14.372\nthe root user has too much power, and\nit can damage the window environment.\n\n129\n00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:16.697\nIt can modify config files that\nit shouldn't being modifying, and\n\n130\n00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:18.510\nthings that a regular user\nshould have to adhere to.\n\n131\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.890\nIt's not able to,\nkinda play nice in that environment.\n\n132\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.624\nSo, the root user is very powerful,\nand very dangerous.\n\n133\n00:06:26.624 --> 00:06:29.200\nAnd so as a sysadmin you\nreally shouldn't be using it.\n\n134\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.980\nYou should never log in as the root user.\n\n135\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.940\nInstead we've got a collection of\nutilities that allow us to gain root\n\n136\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.904\nprivileges without actually\nbeing that root user.\n\n137\n00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:42.659\n&gt;&gt; So Don in addition to these\npowerful options that we see here,\n\n138\n00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.779\nare there any additional considerations\nassociated with this root\n\n139\n00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.365\naccount that we should be aware of?\n\n140\n00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:52.437\nYeah the root user\naccount is special right\n\n141\n00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:55.518\nkind of a special snowflake of our system.\n\n142\n00:06:55.518 --> 00:06:56.695\nIf you look in for\n\n143\n00:06:56.695 --> 00:07:01.746\nexample lets take a look at /atc/passwd\nthat's the user data base for\n\n144\n00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:07.820\nLinux system, and if I look in there I'll\nsee all these different user accounts.\n\n145\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.140\nWell the very first one is root, remember\nI mentioned it was the first user account\n\n146\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.620\nthat was created and so\ntheir user ID is ID zero.\n\n147\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.017\nVersus if you look at mine,\nright if we go way down here and find me,\n\n148\n00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:21.242\nmy user ID is 1000.\n\n149\n00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:26.120\nRight and it jumps to a higher number for\nthose, but the root user is first.\n\n150\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.790\nIf I disable the root user account,\nguess what happens to my system.\n\n151\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.226\nIt doesn't boot, right?\n\n152\n00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:34.494\nThe system requires that root user account\nto be able to boot and load services and\n\n153\n00:07:34.494 --> 00:07:36.430\nthings that are running\nat the very beginning.\n\n154\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.190\nIf I were to run like ps aux, and\n\n155\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.140\ntake a look at all the services\nthat are running on my computer,\n\n156\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.360\nsee how there's a lot that show dpezet,\nthat's me, I'm running stuff, right?\n\n157\n00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.688\nBut there's even more\nthat are showing as root.\n\n158\n00:07:50.688 --> 00:07:53.273\nThese are processes that are being run,\n\n159\n00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:56.554\nthat were likely being run\nbefore I even logged in.\n\n160\n00:07:56.554 --> 00:08:00.948\nIn fact, if I go to the lower process IDs\nway up here at the beginning You'll see\n\n161\n00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:05.226\nthings like process ID number one,\nwhere it was launching a splash screen.\n\n162\n00:08:05.226 --> 00:08:08.200\nThe kernel thread, I see each of these\ndifferent things that were starting.\n\n163\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.710\nThat's all part of my core OS, and\neventually I'll get to the Window Manager,\n\n164\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.460\nwhere it started.\n\n165\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.040\nIt will be buried in here somewhere.\n\n166\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.697\nAnd when that window manager started,\nit was running as root before I finally\n\n167\n00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.962\nprovided it credentials, when I gave\nit my username and password and\n\n168\n00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:25.083\nthen it was able to start launching\neverything under my account.\n\n169\n00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:29.780\nSo that root user is very important and\nwe can't get rid of it.\n\n170\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.710\nIn fact, it's so important that I\ndon't want anybody messing with it.\n\n171\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.820\nSo, like our normal users,\nwe all get directories inside of /home.\n\n172\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.060\nSo if I look in there,\nI've got /home/dpezel and\n\n173\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.540\nif I create three more users,\nthey'll all have folders right here.\n\n174\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.540\nBut the root user doesn't\nhave a folder in /home.\n\n175\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.860\nInstead if I go into /root,\nthey have a folder.\n\n176\n00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.770\nAnd see how I don't have access to it,\nright, it's blocked off, but it is there.\n\n177\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.180\nIf we take a look at our\ndirectory structure for\n\n178\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.610\nroot here, you'll see that\n/root folder right there and\n\n179\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.020\nonly the owner has read, write and\nexecute on it and the owner is root.\n\n180\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.990\nEven the root group doesn't\nhave access to that folder.\n\n181\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.490\nJust the root account\nitself has access and\n\n182\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:17.010\nthey can jump in there and browse into\nthat folder and work with it and so on.\n\n183\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.390\nSo that's separate, it's stored outside\nof the /home space because /home\n\n184\n00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.370\nmight be moved off to another hard drive,\nand if that hard drive fails,\n\n185\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.100\nnow the root user account\ncan't get a session.\n\n186\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.140\nThat could stop the system from booting.\n\n187\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.080\nBecause this is a critical account,\n\n188\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.310\nthe root folder is usually put on\nthe same partition as your boot,\n\n189\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.560\nand system, and any other kind of\ncritical folders and stored separately.\n\n190\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.210\nIt's just a very important\naccount as far accounts go.\n\n191\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.390\nAll right, so\nthose are some of the special things about\n\n192\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.950\nthe root user account, and\nthe main thing that I'm\n\n193\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.430\noveremphasizing here is we just need to\nremember how powerful this account is.\n\n194\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.360\nAnd that basically we really\nshouldn't mess with it, and\n\n195\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.150\nwe really probably shouldn't even use\nthe darn thing if we can avoid it.\n\n196\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.160\n&gt;&gt; So what should we use?\n\n197\n00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.550\nIf we're logged in as a regular user then\nhow do we access some of those higher or\n\n198\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.630\nelevated privileges that we\nmay need from time to time?\n\n199\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there's actually two\ndifferent utilities that we can use for\n\n200\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:13.440\nthis cuz you make a great point as I said\nearlier, if I can't install software,\n\n201\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.510\nhow am I gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Install software?\n\n202\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I can't log in as root,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n203\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.890\nSo the thing here is,\nwe don't need to log in as root.\n\n204\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.300\nWe just need to be able to\nperform certain actions as root.\n\n205\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.020\nWhen I'm installing software yeah,\nI need elevated privileges to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.910\nBut when I'm browsing the web or\nchecking my email or\n\n207\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.110\ncopying files,\nI don't need to be root for that.\n\n208\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.090\nSo we can root when we need it.\n\n209\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.560\nAnd that actually happens quite a bit.\n\n210\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.720\nIt happened in the last episode.\n\n211\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.120\nI ran one utility or another, and\n\n212\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.950\nit told me I had to give it my login\ncredentials to elevate my privileges.\n\n213\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.210\nYou can elevate your privileges and\ntemporarily become root.\n\n214\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.950\nNow, the old way to do this,\nwas to use the SU command.\n\n215\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.400\nSU has been around a long time.\n\n216\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.730\nIt's short for super user.\n\n217\n00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.400\nAnd it lets you impersonate\nother user accounts.\n\n218\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.670\nNow a lot of people don't know that,\n\n219\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.670\nthat the SU command,\nit lets you impersonate the root user.\n\n220\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.140\nSo you can run commands as the root user.\n\n221\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.220\nBut you can actually impersonate\nany user you want with it too.\n\n222\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.220\nSo if I'm an administrator, and\n\n223\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.190\nthe user is telling me something doesn't\nwork, I could pretend to be them, and\n\n224\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.250\nimpersonate them, and then perform an\naction as them, and then see if it worked.\n\n225\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Try to recreate that problem.\n\n226\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of the best\nways to do troubleshooting,\n\n227\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.370\ncuz sometimes people just can't\ncommunicate what the problem is.\n\n228\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.150\nWell, if I wanna install software or\n\n229\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.010\nmake some system change, I need to\ndo it as root, so I could use su.\n\n230\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.150\nThe problem with su is it\ndidn't just run one command.\n\n231\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.550\nIt made you become that user.\n\n232\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.730\nSo if you were in a shell.\n\n233\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.230\nSo like my shell here.\n\n234\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.930\nI could come in and\njust type su and press Enter.\n\n235\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.080\nAnd now it's asking me for\nthe root user's password, right?\n\n236\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.720\nAnd if you know it,\n\n237\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.370\nyou can punch it in and it will give\nyou a shell that is the root user.\n\n238\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.424\nNow I don't remember my\nroot user's password, so\n\n239\n00:11:57.424 --> 00:11:59.220\nI'm gonna get off that occasion failure.\n\n240\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.320\nSo I don't get it, but if we did,\nwe would now have a shell.\n\n241\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.920\nAnd instead of saying dpezet here, it\nwould say root, I would be the root user.\n\n242\n00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.440\nOkay, now, I said this is the old way,\nand you see,\n\n243\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.470\neven me, I don't use it on my own laptop.\n\n244\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.160\nSo what was wrong with this command?\n\n245\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.190\nThe problem was, I would then have\na shell as the root user, and\n\n246\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.130\nI could perform my one activity.\n\n247\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.060\nBut then, if I left it alone.\n\n248\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.980\nIf I forgot and never fixed it,\nthen that shell is now the root user and\n\n249\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.650\neverything else I run in the shell\nis being run as the root user also.\n\n250\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, so\n\n251\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.960\nwe're kinda contradicting ourselves\nin the aspect that you said look,\n\n252\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.200\nwe don't want to stay in this elevated, or\nwe don't want to stay in this root shell.\n\n253\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.705\nSo, now, is there a way that we could,\n\n254\n00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:46.250\na preferfed method that we're\nnot staying at it all the time?\n\n255\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely and\n\n256\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:52.430\nthe preferred method,\nthe new method is a utility called Sudo.\n\n257\n00:12:52.430 --> 00:13:00.340\nSudo, or S-U-D-O, super user do, says,\nI wanna do one command as a super user.\n\n258\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.028\nI don't want to stay the superuser,\nI don't wanna stay root or whatever.\n\n259\n00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:07.780\nI just wanna run one command,\nget in and get out and do it.\n\n260\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.200\nAnd that's the command\nthat we want to use.\n\n261\n00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.620\nNow sudo is more than\nlikely on your system.\n\n262\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.930\nIt's in every Linux and BSD that I've\ntouched for the last ten years at least.\n\n263\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.250\nSo it's been around a long time.\n\n264\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.890\nWhen I say,\nsu is the old way of doing things,\n\n265\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.210\nI mean it's the really\nold way of doing things.\n\n266\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.410\nSo sudo is the one that we want.\n\n267\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.890\nAnd sudo lets us run those commands and\nthey run as root and\n\n268\n00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.570\nthen they go away, right?\n\n269\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.800\nSo just a quick really simple\ndemonstration if I run the whoami command,\n\n270\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.950\nit says, oddly enough, who I am.\n\n271\n00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.060\nAnd so when I run then,\nit says I'm dpezet.\n\n272\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:49.040\nBut if I sudo the whoami command,\nand I run it, it says I'm root.\n\n273\n00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.330\nI just ran that one\ncommand as the root user.\n\n274\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.420\nAnd now I'm back to just dpezet.\n\n275\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.560\nSo I don't have to worry\nabout forgetting myself and\n\n276\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.300\nleaving myself in that shell and\nbeing stuck that way.\n\n277\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.130\nI now know that I run the wrong\ncommand as the root user.\n\n278\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.180\nAnd now I'm back to normal.\n\n279\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.480\nI can't do any damage unless\nI run the sudo command again.\n\n280\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.170\nAnd that's far more ideal.\n\n281\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.700\nAnd I was able to do that without\nactually logging in as root.\n\n282\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.010\nSo this is the way we want to do it.\n\n283\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.810\nNow, it may or\nmay not be set up on your system.\n\n284\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.410\nIt will be installed,\njust about every distro has it.\n\n285\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.710\nBut a lot of them don't have it configured\nfor your user account right off the bat.\n\n286\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.890\nSo you may need to get in there and\ntweak some things.\n\n287\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.310\nThis operating system here is Ubuntu,\nand when I installed Ubuntu, it set up\n\n288\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:42.210\na user account for me and it gave me\npermission to use the sudo command.\n\n289\n00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.670\nSo that's why I never had to know\nmy root user account password.\n\n290\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.220\nI never had to know it because I\nalways had access to the sudo command.\n\n291\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.840\nBut other distributions let you\nset the root user password.\n\n292\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.213\nAnd once you set the root user password,\nyou may log in and\n\n293\n00:14:57.213 --> 00:15:00.522\nyou may not have permission\nto access the sudo command.\n\n294\n00:15:00.522 --> 00:15:02.619\nAnd if you're not able\nto run the sudo command,\n\n295\n00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:04.410\nthen you're gonna need that root user.\n\n296\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.770\nSo you may need to log in\nas root at least one time\n\n297\n00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:13.290\nto be able to go in and\nset up the sudo command for you.\n\n298\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.340\nSo I wanna walk you through that\nprocess of using the sudo command and\n\n299\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.390\ngetting it set up for\na user to be able to use it.\n\n300\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:25.200\nBasically the sudo command uses\na configuration file that's in /etc.\n\n301\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.526\nSo If I go into /etc and\ntake a look inside of there,\n\n302\n00:15:29.526 --> 00:15:33.766\nyou'll find a file called sudoers,\nor sudoers.\n\n303\n00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:39.810\nMost people say sudo,\ncuz it's like a pseudo user or whatever.\n\n304\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.280\nBut it's super user do, so it's\ntechnically sudo and this would be sudoers\n\n305\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.100\nfile which I fill find in here somewhere,\nthere it is, sudoers, right there.\n\n306\n00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.720\nThat file lists all the users who have\npermission to use the sudo command.\n\n307\n00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.744\nAnd if you're not in this file, you're\nnot allowed to use the sudo command.\n\n308\n00:15:57.744 --> 00:16:02.532\nSo, on a new CentOS system, so\nif I install CentOS I will know my root\n\n309\n00:16:02.532 --> 00:16:07.320\nuser password cuz it makes you\nprovide that during the install, but\n\n310\n00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.360\nI won't be in the sudoers file.\n\n311\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.210\nSo I'll need to login\nas Root at least once,\n\n312\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.930\nadd myself to the sudoers file,\nand then logout as Root.\n\n313\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:23.930\nAnd then from then on I can just login\nas me and run sudo and get going at it.\n\n314\n00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.370\nThe challenge here is that the sudoers\nfile looks a little weird,\n\n315\n00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.760\nthe syntax of it, right?\n\n316\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.391\nIf I take a look at that file,\nlet me just open it up here, and\n\n317\n00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:37.900\noops, [LAUGH] You need permission to\nmess with the sudoers file, there we go.\n\n318\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.980\nIf you look at it, the syntax in\nit is a little bit confusing and\n\n319\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.100\nthey do comment it.\n\n320\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.950\nSo they give some kind of tips and advice\nin there but not a whole heck of a lot.\n\n321\n00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.450\nAnd at the end of the day, if you wanna\ngive yourself permission to be able to\n\n322\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.140\nexecute commands, you need to put in\na line with really four different values.\n\n323\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.634\nOkay, I've got five for mine, but\nthere's really four that are critical.\n\n324\n00:16:58.634 --> 00:17:02.177\nSo, as an example,\nif I wanna add myself or add another user,\n\n325\n00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:04.230\nwell, you can see the root user.\n\n326\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.280\nThe root user has\npermissions to jump in and\n\n327\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.130\nuse sudo, I do too, down here at\nthe bottom I've given myself access.\n\n328\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.440\nLet's say I have a username, Bob and\n\n329\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.320\nI want Bob to have access,\nwell I would need to add a line for Bob.\n\n330\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.722\nAnd you can do it by user or you can do\nit by group, normally we do it by user\n\n331\n00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:23.340\ncuz you're giving specific\npeople access to a utility.\n\n332\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:27.590\nAnd so you can punch them in there and\nthen what they're allowed to do with sudo,\n\n333\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.660\nnow, the challenge here\nis if you make a typo.\n\n334\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.096\nIf you make a typo in this file,\nthen sudo breaks and it doesn't work, and\n\n335\n00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:41.636\nso, if I make a mistake in this file and\nI break sudo, and like me right now.\n\n336\n00:17:41.636 --> 00:17:45.507\nWhere I don't use my root user password\nbecause I've never used it right,\n\n337\n00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:49.206\nif I break sudo, I just lost\nthe administrative access to my computer.\n\n338\n00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:52.628\nAnd that's a problem, I'll have to go\nin and reset the password for router or\n\n339\n00:17:52.628 --> 00:17:55.802\nsomething to be able to get in there and\nfix it, it's a pain in the butt.\n\n340\n00:17:55.802 --> 00:18:01.517\nSo we need to make sure we don't make\ntypos, and to help with that there's\n\n341\n00:18:01.517 --> 00:18:06.690\na utility called visudo okay,\nvi is the Unix text editor, right?\n\n342\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.430\nSo it's a command line text editor\nthat's included in darn near every\n\n343\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.920\nLinux distro out there, and\nthen sudo, it's just saying,.\n\n344\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.389\nWe want to edit sudo's configuration,\nbut it's got a syntax checker in it,\n\n345\n00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.435\nand if you make a mistake here,\nit'll let you know.\n\n346\n00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:23.964\nAnd that will help make sure\nyou don't make a typo, and\n\n347\n00:18:23.964 --> 00:18:29.970\nyou don't lock yourself out, so you can\nedit /etc/sudoers directly if you want.\n\n348\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.219\nIf you know you're perfect,\nif you know you don't make mistakes,\n\n349\n00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:37.223\nthat's the utility for you right, but\nif you're like me, visudo, super handy.\n\n350\n00:18:37.223 --> 00:18:40.840\nIt's installed alongside sudo so\nif you have one you have the other, and\n\n351\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.117\nyou can run that, and you can jump\nin there and start to modify it.\n\n352\n00:18:44.117 --> 00:18:47.256\nNow you do need permissions,\nso when I mentioned if\n\n353\n00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:51.710\nyou don't have access to Sudu,\nyou would need to login as Root one time.\n\n354\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.044\nOnce you login as Root you would\nspecify the visudo command, and\n\n355\n00:18:56.044 --> 00:19:00.930\nwhen you run that, which I'll sudu\nthe visudo command which is funny.\n\n356\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.801\nWe'll go in here, and now we can go in and\nwe can modify it, and\n\n357\n00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:07.084\nit will do syntax checking to make\nsure that it doesn't get messed up.\n\n358\n00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:11.388\nAnd interesting thing here,\nI'm on an Ubuntu system, I ran visudo but\n\n359\n00:19:11.388 --> 00:19:15.418\ninstead of using the vi editor,\nit actually used the nano editor.\n\n360\n00:19:15.418 --> 00:19:19.525\nSo be careful with that one, if I were on\na Red Hat system I'd actually be in vi,\n\n361\n00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:23.730\nbut here it's nano, nano's a little bit\neasier anyway, so that works for me.\n\n362\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.906\nSo I'll come down here and\nnow I can add in a user, so\n\n363\n00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:31.414\nIf I wanted to add an account for\nBob Smith.\n\n364\n00:19:31.414 --> 00:19:35.054\nThen I would just come in here and say\nBSmith and I would give him access, now,\n\n365\n00:19:35.054 --> 00:19:38.650\nthat's assuming the user account\ncalled BSmith actually exists, right?\n\n366\n00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.102\nSo I need to make that, now, what's all\nthis junk afterwards, the junk afterwards\n\n367\n00:19:43.102 --> 00:19:46.694\nhere is the part that's confusing,\nand if you don't really care.\n\n368\n00:19:46.694 --> 00:19:50.239\nIf you just want access to sudo and\nthat's it, just copy whatever is set for\n\n369\n00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:52.690\nroot, and so\nyou can look up higher in the file.\n\n370\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.258\nAnd you'll find where it's defining\nthe settings for Root, and\n\n371\n00:19:55.258 --> 00:19:57.085\nyou can just copy whatever they have,\nright?\n\n372\n00:19:57.085 --> 00:20:00.599\nAnd that'll give you the access to sudo\nand the ability to run all the commands\n\n373\n00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:03.373\nyou need, but if you actually\nwanna understand this stuff.\n\n374\n00:20:03.373 --> 00:20:07.130\nWhich is the thing we do here,\neach of these represents a certain\n\n375\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.410\ntype of setting, so the first part\nhere is either a user or a group.\n\n376\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.861\nIf it's a group, you need to stick\na percent sign at the beginning,\n\n377\n00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:14.684\nthat's how it knows.\n\n378\n00:20:14.684 --> 00:20:17.896\nSee, like here, I've got %admin, so\n\n379\n00:20:17.896 --> 00:20:22.630\nthere's a group called admin and\nthat's getting access.\n\n380\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.851\nThe permissions are applied in\norder from top to bottom so\n\n381\n00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:30.090\nthe things down here on the bottom will\noverride the things that are up top.\n\n382\n00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.591\nSo be careful with that cuz I\nmight be in the admin group, but\n\n383\n00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:35.710\nif I set something different down here\nthese are the settings that apply.\n\n384\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.111\nSo be aware of that, that's a weird quirk\nof this file, but the next couple of\n\n385\n00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:44.810\nvalues basically boil down to a few\nthings, the first one is the host, right?\n\n386\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.773\nWhat computer you're on, now when it says,\nall, that means I can be on any computer.\n\n387\n00:20:48.773 --> 00:20:51.794\nThat doesn't mean I'm giving myself\nsudo access on every computer\n\n388\n00:20:51.794 --> 00:20:52.860\non the planet, right?\n\n389\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:58.813\nIt just means I can be on one computer\nremoted into this computer and\n\n390\n00:20:58.813 --> 00:21:01.056\nit would let me use sudo.\n\n391\n00:21:01.056 --> 00:21:04.460\nIf I wasn't, if I wanted to make it where\nI had to be sitting right here I could\n\n392\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.120\nchange that ALL to be the host\nname of this computer.\n\n393\n00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.101\nAnd then I could only sudo if I was\nactually sitting right here at this\n\n394\n00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:12.154\nmachine, that's useful in some scenarios.\n\n395\n00:21:12.154 --> 00:21:15.787\n&gt;&gt; Well, that would be nice to know if\nyour company had a local administration\n\n396\n00:21:15.787 --> 00:21:18.797\npolicy only and\ndidn't allow any remote administration so.\n\n397\n00:21:18.797 --> 00:21:22.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's an upside to it and\nthere's a downside,\n\n398\n00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:27.175\nwhich is now you're killing your ability\nto remote administer the server.\n\n399\n00:21:27.175 --> 00:21:30.172\nAnd then you get other challenges there\ntoo, so you have to be careful with it but\n\n400\n00:21:30.172 --> 00:21:33.150\nyou can certainly create something\nthat matches your security policy.\n\n401\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:37.166\nBut most people just put ALL don't think\nabout it cuz you can use firewalls to\n\n402\n00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:40.446\ncontrol access and\nother things to filter what people can do.\n\n403\n00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:43.984\nBut that's what it is for, it's saying,\nyou can only do this locally or\n\n404\n00:21:43.984 --> 00:21:45.840\nremotely from these five computers.\n\n405\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.920\nThese are the ones you can put in multiple\nlines and do it, the next part is the user\n\n406\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.405\nthey're allowed to impersonate and\nnormally, we're impersonating Root, right?\n\n407\n00:21:56.405 --> 00:21:59.108\nWhen you run sudo by itself\nyou are impersonating route,\n\n408\n00:21:59.108 --> 00:22:03.530\nthat's the default person, but I could be\ngiving Bob the ability to impersonate me.\n\n409\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:08.912\nSo I might say, ALL=dpezet, now Bob\ncan be logged in from any computer and\n\n410\n00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:12.512\nrun commands as me,\nthat's how this can be used.\n\n411\n00:22:12.512 --> 00:22:15.686\nBut typically, when we say ALL, and\nactually, I was supposed to put\n\n412\n00:22:15.686 --> 00:22:19.050\nthe other one in parentheses too cuz\nyou would do commas after each user.\n\n413\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.328\nSo you have to put parentheses\naround it but we'll say, ALL, so\n\n414\n00:22:22.328 --> 00:22:25.379\nthey can impersonate,\nnot just Root, but any other user.\n\n415\n00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:29.719\nYou can run sudo-u followed by a username\nand now you're impersonating that other\n\n416\n00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:33.430\nuser instead of just Root,\nwhich is the default, right?\n\n417\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.052\nThen the next part, the next part is\nwhat commands you're allowed to run,\n\n418\n00:22:37.052 --> 00:22:39.997\nand you can actually limit it\ndown to just certain commands.\n\n419\n00:22:39.997 --> 00:22:44.813\nYou can be very specific and say, I want\nCherokee to be able to use sudo to use\n\n420\n00:22:44.813 --> 00:22:48.565\nthe useradd command so\nshe can now add users to the system.\n\n421\n00:22:48.565 --> 00:22:52.237\nBut I don't wanna give her usermod,\nI don't want her changing existing users,\n\n422\n00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:54.993\njust adding new ones, so\nI could come in and I could say that.\n\n423\n00:22:54.993 --> 00:22:58.242\nFor the command here I could just say,\nuser add, and that's that,\n\n424\n00:22:58.242 --> 00:23:02.188\nif I did more than one command, I'd add\na footprint, this is trying to do commas.\n\n425\n00:23:02.188 --> 00:23:06.459\nBut I could then specify it, but\nwe typically say, I'm an administrator,\n\n426\n00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:09.210\nI want all commands to be able to do it.\n\n427\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.261\nNow, if I stop right there, that's\nactually enough, and that's gonna give me\n\n428\n00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:16.733\naccess to everything that I need,\nbut you could go one step further.\n\n429\n00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:21.683\nBy default, the first time you run sudo\nit's gonna prompt you for your password,\n\n430\n00:23:21.683 --> 00:23:25.360\nright, and so then,\nonce it prompts for the password.\n\n431\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.165\nYou clear that and\n\n432\n00:23:26.165 --> 00:23:29.608\nthen once you're through the password\nnow you can start running commands.\n\n433\n00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:32.823\nAnd it will stay active for a period of\ntime which I think is in the file here\n\n434\n00:23:32.823 --> 00:23:35.792\nsomewhere, actually I don't see it so\nit must be in the defaults.\n\n435\n00:23:35.792 --> 00:23:39.131\nThere's something like 15 minutes I think,\nwhere you can then run sudo over, and\n\n436\n00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:41.590\nover, and over again and\nit won't ask you for your password.\n\n437\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.565\nBut eventually it'll start asking for\nthe password again, or\n\n438\n00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:50.744\nyou can do what I did for my account which\nis say, no password, or nopasswd:all.\n\n439\n00:23:50.744 --> 00:23:53.549\nAnd that means I can run any command and\nit won't prompt me for\n\n440\n00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:56.313\nmy password, each time you see\nme run sudo in this episode.\n\n441\n00:23:56.313 --> 00:24:00.014\nIt never asked me for a password right,\nnow positives and negatives,\n\n442\n00:24:00.014 --> 00:24:03.985\none, it makes my life a lot easier,\nI can run sudo whenever I want, right?\n\n443\n00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:08.500\nOn the other hand though, let's say I\ndecide to walk out and get some coffee.\n\n444\n00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.330\nAnd Cherokee says time to pull a prank.\n\n445\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.600\nShe can step right over onto my keyboard\nhere and start sudo'ing like crazy, and\n\n446\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.649\nit's never gonna ask for a password.\n\n447\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.625\nWell, I don't worry about it so much.\n\n448\n00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.220\nOne, because almost everything\nis on camera around here.\n\n449\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:22.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n450\n00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.780\ntwo, because I have a screen lock on my\nsystem, so I walk away, there's a very\n\n451\n00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.910\nsmall amount of time that my system would\nbe available where somebody could do that.\n\n452\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.950\nBut in a high security environment,\nthat would be a problem.\n\n453\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.170\nI might not want that.\n\n454\n00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.900\nI might wanna turn that off and\nsay, hey, if I walk away,\n\n455\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.120\nsomebody could jump on my keyboard,\nbut if they tried to sudo something,\n\n456\n00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.470\nit would prompt them for my password.\n\n457\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.560\nAnd so they wouldn't be able\nto elevate those privileges.\n\n458\n00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.050\nSo this one, we have to use with caution.\n\n459\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.250\nI'll use it on my own laptop,\nbut I won't use it on servers.\n\n460\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.497\nI won't use it on other systems\nthat have critical data, but\n\n461\n00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:55.778\nI may use it right here.\n\n462\n00:24:55.778 --> 00:24:58.358\nSo it's just up to you how you\nwant to configure that one and\n\n463\n00:24:58.358 --> 00:25:00.620\nwhat settings you want to run with there.\n\n464\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.830\nSo, be aware of that, but\nonce all this is set now we can save it,\n\n465\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.620\nand if we messed up something,\nif there was an error it'll let us know.\n\n466\n00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.935\nSo I'm gonna just save mine, and\nnotice the filename that it's writing,\n\n467\n00:25:13.935 --> 00:25:20.310\n/etc/sudoers.tmp it's not actually\nwriting to the sudoers file.\n\n468\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.510\nAnd that's because it's gonna\nrun it through a check, look for\n\n469\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.530\nany syntax errors and\nif it finds any, it'll warn us.\n\n470\n00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.760\nIf it doesn't find any, it'll apply.\n\n471\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.850\nAnd now that we're in that file, we can go\nin and we can start to run sudo commands.\n\n472\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:38.030\nAnd so I can say, sudo ls, or\nI can take a look at a file,\n\n473\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:44.820\nlike when I try to run more /etc/sudoers,\nI don't have permission.\n\n474\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:52.180\nBut if I run sudo, and then more\n/etc/sudoers now I can look at it.\n\n475\n00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.620\nI'm running individual commands as that\nroot user getting in, getting out,\n\n476\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.810\ngetting it done and now I don't have\nto worry about anything too crazy.\n\n477\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:03.480\nThis is the best way to\nelevate your privileges, and\n\n478\n00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.242\nwhen the GUI prompts you for\na password that's exactly what it's doing,\n\n479\n00:26:07.242 --> 00:26:10.836\nit's running one thing as a root user and\nthen moving back down to use.\n\n480\n00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:14.150\nAll your other window elements on the\nscreen are running as your regular user\n\n481\n00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.560\nand giving you the best security possible.\n\n482\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.000\n&gt;&gt; All right Don this seems like\na great security feature but\n\n483\n00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.990\nit also could be a little cumbersome\nif I had to type in multiple commands.\n\n484\n00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.540\nIs there a way that I\ncould bypass that for\n\n485\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.240\nthe time being like if I'm\nissuing several commands?\n\n486\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.370\nYeah, I run into this when I'm\npoking around in the log files and\n\n487\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.340\nevery single log file needs\nthat root privilege access.\n\n488\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.460\nAnd so I'm having sudo this, sudo that.\n\n489\n00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.907\nThe best answer that it can give you is\nyeah, you gotta type sudo every time, and\n\n490\n00:26:38.907 --> 00:26:39.530\njust suffer.\n\n491\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.955\n[LAUGH] And that's it,\nyou gotta do each one.\n\n492\n00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:45.540\nBut there are some shortcuts you\ncan take if you are careful.\n\n493\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.770\nSo, you're gonna do the scouts honor I\npromise to be careful whatever it is.\n\n494\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.847\nI wasn't a scout so I don't know [LAUGH].\n\n495\n00:26:50.847 --> 00:26:54.990\nBasically, we can kinda break the rules\na little bit and say you know what,\n\n496\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.250\nI am gonna log in as that stinking\nroot user and I'm gonna do something.\n\n497\n00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.890\nSo the su command that\nI showed you earlier,\n\n498\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.630\nI didn't actually run,\nwould let me get a shell as the root user.\n\n499\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.000\nAnd if I forget to close it,\nI'm that root user for a while.\n\n500\n00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.990\nYou can actually achieve\nthe same thing with sudo.\n\n501\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.680\nLet me get to my communal prompt here.\n\n502\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.110\nIf I run sudo -s and\nI always remember the mnemonic in my head.\n\n503\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.420\nRemember the s for shell, but\nit's actually s for session.\n\n504\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:26.250\nSo I just say I am going to run sudo\n-s because I want to get a root shell.\n\n505\n00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.890\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe're invoking that root shell, okay.\n\n506\n00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.594\n&gt;&gt; Right, and when I run it,\nI didn't actually run a command,\n\n507\n00:27:31.594 --> 00:27:32.840\nI launched a shell.\n\n508\n00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.200\nAnd look at my prompt, I'm still\nat Don's laptop, but I'm now root.\n\n509\n00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.680\nAnd so I can run things like who I'm I,\nand it shows that I'm root.\n\n510\n00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.893\nAnd I can say more /etc/sudoers,\nand I didn't have to run sudo.\n\n511\n00:27:46.893 --> 00:27:50.109\nEverything I'm running is running as root.\n\n512\n00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:54.462\nAnd so, now I can browse into /var/log and\nstart poking around in my log files,\n\n513\n00:27:54.462 --> 00:27:57.982\nwhich usually you need to be an admin,\nbut now I can jump in here and\n\n514\n00:27:57.982 --> 00:28:02.610\nmess with all the sorts of stuff stuff, or\nthe print spool, that's always a fun one.\n\n515\n00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.135\nCuz each directory inside a spool\nhas a weird crazy permissions on it,\n\n516\n00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:08.960\nsuper annoying to navigate\nas regular administrator.\n\n517\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.880\nNow I can just browse in here and see\nwhatever I want, whoops, I can make typos.\n\n518\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.840\nSee that's the caution we\nhave to worry about, right.\n\n519\n00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.130\nThat as doing this as a root user,\nI can browse in here, but\n\n520\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.270\nI can also cause trouble.\n\n521\n00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.400\n&gt;&gt; So it is similar to like what we saw\nbefore where we kind of need to remember\n\n522\n00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.425\nto put that toilet seat back down.\n\n523\n00:28:27.425 --> 00:28:29.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that we're not just leaving\n\n524\n00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.510\nourselves exposed here?\n\n525\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.780\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right.\n\n526\n00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.430\nIf I walked away right now\nyou don't even have to sudo,\n\n527\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.210\nit says root right on the screen.\n\n528\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.890\nYou know that you have\nfull access to my system.\n\n529\n00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.760\nOr the real risk here,\ncuz I'm not gonna walk away and\n\n530\n00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.910\nhave my machine unattended,\nthat's not usually gonna happen.\n\n531\n00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.410\nBut the real risk here is myself,\nI could make a mistake.\n\n532\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.320\nI jump down here, and I just want to do\nsome regular, old run-of-the-mill thing.\n\n533\n00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.080\nSo, I decide that I'm going to\nstart downloading some files.\n\n534\n00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.430\nWell, I forget that I'm\nlogged in there as root.\n\n535\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.550\nAnd so those files aren't\ngoing into /home/dpezet,\n\n536\n00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:06.450\nthey're going into my home directory,\nwhich is /root.\n\n537\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.150\nAnd they'll be in here, and\nnot where I expect them to be.\n\n538\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.660\nOr, permissions will be messed up,\nbecause what user am I?\n\n539\n00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.750\nI'm the root user, so\nif I go into my home folder, /home/dpezet,\n\n540\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:24.210\nand I make a directory called test, and\nI start taking a look at the directories,\n\n541\n00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.410\nlook who the owner and\ngroup of that folder is.\n\n542\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:32.740\nSo later on when I go and try and browse\nto that, it's in my own home folder.\n\n543\n00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:38.550\nSo if I fire up my files, and\nI go to my home folder right here and\n\n544\n00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.920\nI see there's test, and I try to browse\ninto it, well [LAUGH] the folders empty.\n\n545\n00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.980\nI didn't get an error, there's nothing in\nthere, but I'm gonna get permission denied\n\n546\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.310\nif there's contents in here because\nI'm not the owner, I didn't create it.\n\n547\n00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.570\nThe root user created it.\n\n548\n00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.790\nThat's the kind of mistake that can\nbe made as we work with this stuff.\n\n549\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:01.320\nSo it's important that we go in and\nwe manipulate that.\n\n550\n00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.380\nI didn't get an error because\nI had read permission,\n\n551\n00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.320\neveryone else has read permissions,\nbut if we start tweaking that,\n\n552\n00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.510\nif I try and go change the permissions for\nexample, I've only got read.\n\n553\n00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.510\nSo if I browse into my own home folder and\n\n554\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.740\nI go in to test and\nI try and put a file there.\n\n555\n00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.940\nSo let me just grab some\nfile here at random and\n\n556\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.190\nI'll go into my test folder and\nI'll paste it.\n\n557\n00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.010\nI can't paste it.\n\n558\n00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:29.950\nPaste isn't even an option for\n\n559\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.670\nme because I don't have permissions\nto access that resource right here.\n\n560\n00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.470\nSo those are the types of mistakes.\n\n561\n00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.100\nSome of the mistakes can\nbe really really bad.\n\n562\n00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.550\nYou can actually make it\nwhere your system wont boot,\n\n563\n00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:44.130\nyou can throw a bad file somewhere, you\ncan weaken security unintentionally and\n\n564\n00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.620\nnow you have really damaged things.\n\n565\n00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.250\nSo we do need to be careful with this.\n\n566\n00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.680\nBut if I need to run a ton of commands\nin a row, all as root, I might do this.\n\n567\n00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.810\nAnd just remember when\nyour done to type exit.\n\n568\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.950\nExit's gonna close out that shell and\nnow I'm back to dpezet.\n\n569\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.910\nI'm back to my regular user session and\n\n570\n00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.446\neverything I'm running is\nrunning under my credentials.\n\n571\n00:31:02.446 --> 00:31:05.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it looks like remembering\nis really key there to keep ourselves out\n\n572\n00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.440\nof some trouble.\n\n573\n00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.650\nYou've given us some great\nadvice as to what we should and\n\n574\n00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.180\nshould not be running as, but for\nthis show Don, we are out of time.\n\n575\n00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.960\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n576\n00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.860\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n577\n00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.660\nAnd I'm Don Pezet.\n\n578\n00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.899\n&gt;&gt; See you

00:00:08.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.530\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Becoming\na Linux System Administrator series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.470\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.050\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ndive a little bit deeper and\n\n8\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.290\ntake a look at some\nadministrative commands.\n\n9\n00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.930\nWe've already been acclimated\nwith some graphical user\n\n10\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.310\ninterface ways that we\ncan manager our systems.\n\n11\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.470\nBut back in studios with us today we have\nMr. Don Pezet to cover well, the CLI.\n\n12\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870\nHow is it going Don?\n\n13\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.060\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Cherokee,\n\n14\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.920\nready to dive right back into the world\nof Linux system administration.\n\n15\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.840\nAnd one of the really intimidating\nthings that we have with Linux is,\n\n16\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.880\nit gives us so much power and\nflexibility to do what we want.\n\n17\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.900\nBut that leads to us having so much\npower and flexibility that sometimes we\n\n18\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900\ncan't necessarily figure\nout how to do what we want.\n\n19\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.850\nAnd it can be overwhelming, the amount of\ncommands and options and features we have.\n\n20\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.760\nSo in the first couple of episodes,\nwe focused in on some specific tasks and\n\n21\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.950\nways that we can make them easier.\n\n22\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.240\nIn this episode I want to\ngo a little more broad and\n\n23\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.750\nsay what if I want to achieve a goal?\n\n24\n00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.670\nI wanna configure something,\nI wanna use a tool.\n\n25\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.910\nBut I don't know what the tool is.\n\n26\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.160\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n27\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.070\nSo one of the general rules we\ncan follow to figure out what\n\n28\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.070\ntools are available to us and\nhow we work with them.\n\n29\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.850\nSo that's what we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Don, when we were talking about this\nGraphical User Interface Tools you did\n\n31\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.770\nmention, hey if you’re not aware of what’s\nout there go ahead and read the book or\n\n32\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.630\nthere’s a manual that’s associated\nwith that particular operating system.\n\n33\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.600\nBut is there any location where we\ncan maybe find a cheat sheet, or\n\n34\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.690\na shortcut to specific commands\nthat I might frequently use?\n\n35\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.530\nThere is good documentation out there.\n\n37\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.120\nIf you go to Red Hat's user portal,\nwhich you can sign up for a free account.\n\n38\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.110\nYou don't actually have to\nbuy Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n39\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.250\nAnd once you get a free account, you can\nlog in and view all the documentation.\n\n40\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.850\nThere's really good stuff there.\n\n41\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.900\nCanonical's website,\nthe people that make Ubuntu,\n\n42\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.860\nthey have some decent documentation.\n\n43\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.550\nBut Arch Linux.\n\n44\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.720\nDoesn't matter if you like it or hate it,\ntheir documentation is some of the best.\n\n45\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.360\nAnd you can go to their site,\nthey have a whole Arch Linux wiki\n\n46\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.840\nthat really lays things out and\nreally goes into detail.\n\n47\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.811\nBut even if you don't have that, if you're\njust sitting down at a Linux box and\n\n48\n00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.086\nyou need to work with it.\n\n49\n00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:16.040\nThere's a few basic rules and\nguidelines that most distros follow,\n\n50\n00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.490\nthat you can use to find\nthe commands that you want.\n\n51\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.300\nIn an earlier series, when we did\nthe Becoming a Linux Power User series,\n\n52\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.060\nwe talked about the Filesystem\nHierarchy Standard, the FHS.\n\n53\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.290\nIn the Filesystem Hierarchy,\nassuming distros follow it,\n\n54\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.530\nmost commands end up in the same\ndirectory on every distro.\n\n55\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.130\nSo you know where you can go and\nlook and just see what's available.\n\n56\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.980\nSo if I ever sit down on a machine and\nI say, boy, I wanna add a user account but\n\n57\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.740\nI don't know the command for that.\n\n58\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.680\nI could try and guess the command.\n\n59\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.800\nAnd so maybe I go and\nI just access a CLI and\n\n60\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.460\nI start typing things trying to guess it.\n\n61\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.190\nThat can work, but\n\n62\n00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.030\nyou have to be careful because sometimes a\ncommand might seem like it does one thing.\n\n63\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.350\nAnd in actuality it does another.\n\n64\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.860\nAnd so you can really mess something\nup if you don't do it right.\n\n65\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.610\nSo we need to go in and actually find\nthe real commands that we're looking for.\n\n66\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.840\nAnd some of the assumptions\nthat we can make is that\n\n67\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.820\nmost Linux distros follow\nthat filesystem hierarchy.\n\n68\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.800\nSo let me show you what I mean and\nwhy this matters.\n\n69\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.740\nThis is in an Ubuntu machine\nthat I'm on right now, and\n\n70\n00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.610\nif I change into my root folder and\njust take a look at what's in there.\n\n71\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.740\nI see all these different\nfolders that are laid out.\n\n72\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.620\nA couple of these folders are really\nimportant because they hold executables,\n\n73\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.990\nthey hold programs.\n\n74\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.428\nMost notably bin and sbin,\nthose two right there.\n\n75\n00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:38.370\nThen an sbin,\neach of these contain binaries,\n\n76\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.090\nthey contain executables\nthat are important.\n\n77\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.989\nBut they varying degrees of importance,\nand and so\n\n78\n00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.770\nthat's how this stuff gets divided up.\n\n79\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.170\nThe bin folder for example contains\nexecutables that are required for\n\n80\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.910\nthe system to be able to boot up.\n\n81\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.800\nIf I try and boot my system,\nI'm missing some of the programs in /bin.\n\n82\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.810\nI might not be able to boot up,\nthat would be really bad.\n\n83\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.520\nSo, these are considered critical core.\n\n84\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.640\nI've got to have these.\n\n85\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.040\nAnd then sbin, those are ones that are\navailable for us as system administrators.\n\n86\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.444\nThese are system utilities,\nthat we're gonna be executing for\n\n87\n00:04:14.444 --> 00:04:16.596\ngeneral administration of the system.\n\n88\n00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:20.680\nAnd so if I take a look at /bin and\nI start poking around in there.\n\n89\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.990\nAnd so, I'll just pull up a listing,\nthere's quite a few files.\n\n90\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.950\nBut these aren't things that I\nwill be using every single day.\n\n91\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.110\nWell, not all of them.\n\n92\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.210\nSome of these maybe like bash.\n\n93\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.550\nBash is my shell.\n\n94\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.160\nI use my shell every single day.\n\n95\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.300\nSo here's one that's required for\n\n96\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.980\nboot because it's using bashes part of the\nboot process, but I use it everyday too.\n\n97\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.140\nSo, right here in slash bin I can find it.\n\n98\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.110\nYou see,\nother things in here too like GZIP.\n\n99\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.850\nIf I want to zip an unzip archives,\nI got it right there.\n\n100\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.910\nTAR, if I wanna create tape archives.\n\n101\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.380\nA lot of us don't think of these utilities\nis important for booting the system.\n\n102\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.540\nWhy is creating a tape archive is\nimportant for booting the system?\n\n103\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.208\nWell, a lot of the log files,\nwhen they get full, they rotate,\n\n104\n00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:05.374\nthey get tarred and gzipped.\n\n105\n00:05:05.374 --> 00:05:06.730\nThey get compressed and so\nthe utilities power that.\n\n106\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.880\nIt is part of that boot process.\n\n107\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.520\nThe file system checks,\nyou`ll see things in here like fsck,\n\n108\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.150\nactually fsck is in a different folder.\n\n109\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.750\nWe'll see some other ones\nin here like fuser mount.\n\n110\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.260\nWhere it`s mounting hard drives.\n\n111\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.110\nOr these ntfs mount utilities here.\n\n112\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.640\nFor mounting Windows file systems\nif I wanna use those in Linux.\n\n113\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.000\nThose can be mounted at boot time and so\nwe need the drivers to be available and\n\n114\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.730\nthe utilities to be\navailable at boot time.\n\n115\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.188\nThese are all located right here in /bin.\n\n116\n00:05:37.188 --> 00:05:39.760\nBut /sbin is very similar.\n\n117\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.040\nSo if I go into /sbin and\nI take a look around I'll see\n\n118\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.680\nmore utilities including like the file\nsystem check utility that I mentioned.\n\n119\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.420\nOr more mount utilities that are in here\nfor being able to mount file systems.\n\n120\n00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.890\nNow some of these are actual binaries.\n\n121\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.260\nSome of these are simply aliases,\nthey're links.\n\n122\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.130\nLike all these MKFSs.\n\n123\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.570\nMost of these are just links to\nthe original mkfs utility with\n\n124\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.530\nsome command line\narguments already provided.\n\n125\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.280\nSo it kind of makes them easier to type.\n\n126\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.230\nBut these are utilities that aren't\nnecessarily required to boot\n\n127\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.750\nyour system up.\n\n128\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.140\nBut they are used for\ngeneral system administration.\n\n129\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.370\nSo when I format a hard drive.\n\n130\n00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.840\nI'm not gonna format\na hard drive at boot time.\n\n131\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.090\nI'm gonna format a hard drive afterwards\nwhile I'm using the computer.\n\n132\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.300\nAnd so I'll use the mkfs, or make file\nsystem user utility to go in and do that.\n\n133\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.420\nThat's how a lot of this stuff is,\nit's things that we need just for\n\n134\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.980\ngeneral administration.\n\n135\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.670\nSwap on, that's an important one.\n\n136\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.300\nThat turns on your swap file.\n\n137\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.110\nSo if you've got a partition or\na page file setup It has to be enabled,\n\n138\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.110\nwell what happens if it's not enabled,\nit just doesn't work right?\n\n139\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.400\nIt doesn't stop you from booting\n\n140\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.640\nyou just don't have that extra\nvirtual memory if you need it.\n\n141\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.060\nSo it's not considered\ncritical to boot but\n\n142\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.960\nit is a core system\nadministration function.\n\n143\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.054\nSo /bin and /sbin have those utilities and\n\n144\n00:06:57.054 --> 00:07:01.280\nit's really built around\nmanaging the operating system.\n\n145\n00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.820\nGeneral system administration for\nthe operating system itself.\n\n146\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.830\nThat's what /bin and /sbin contain.\n\n147\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.540\nSo that's typically where we're\ngonna go to poke around and\n\n148\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.130\nlook for utilities like that.\n\n149\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.270\nNow, that's not the only place\nwhere we're gonna find things.\n\n150\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.030\nBut you'll find most of what you need.\n\n151\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.610\nI showed the file system one.\n\n152\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.550\nI think I mentioned user add.\n\n153\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.670\nLet me see if that one's in here.\n\n154\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.340\nSo managing user accounts.\n\n155\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.180\nNot a critical thing for boot.\n\n156\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.040\nAnd if I look in here I don't see\nuser add, you'd think we'd see it,\n\n157\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.140\nI have a basic understanding of\nthe alphabet and it's not there.\n\n158\n00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.560\nSo obviously this isn't the only place\nthese utilities are gonna be found.\n\n159\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.860\nThere's other places too, but\n\n160\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.460\nthe majority of what we're looking for\nwill be right in these two folders.\n\n161\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.670\n&gt;&gt; So are there any exceptions to this\nparticular rule, maybe depending on\n\n162\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.510\ndifferent operating systems or\nthings that we should be aware of?\n\n163\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there are good exceptions and\nthere's bad exceptions.\n\n164\n00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:55.737\nA good exception would be\nsomething like user add.\n\n165\n00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:57.402\nI couldn't find user add right here.\n\n166\n00:07:57.402 --> 00:08:00.075\nAnd that's because it's\njust stored somewhere else.\n\n167\n00:08:00.075 --> 00:08:02.110\nThese folders that I'm poking around in,\n\n168\n00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.954\nthese are ones that are part of my distro\nand they're considered core binaries,\n\n169\n00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:08.752\nones that are going to be there\npretty much no matter what.\n\n170\n00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:12.560\nBut, there's other ones that are found\nin the slash user folder, so\n\n171\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.510\nif I go into /usr, right so\nnow I'm just in /usr.\n\n172\n00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.930\nAnd I take a look in there,\nI've got another bin folder, and\n\n173\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.270\nanother sbin folder, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.310\nAnd this bin folder is full of system\nadministration utilities that sysadmins\n\n175\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.600\nuse, and usr/sbin is full of utilities\nthat any user can use right?\n\n176\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.040\nSo here's even more utilities, so\nif I go intu bin, so now I'm in /usr/bin.\n\n177\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.000\nAnd I take a look in there,\nI'll find all sorts of interesting\n\n178\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.810\nthings in here like the zip command or\nsome of the other ones that we use,\n\n179\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.830\nlike MC, the minute command in this\nlittle file manager that I use.\n\n180\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.570\nThese are our utilities that\nhave been installed and\n\n181\n00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.700\nyou'll see there's more in here by\nfar than the other folders, right,\n\n182\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.920\nbecause these are all ones that I've\ninstalled in addition to the core OS.\n\n183\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.530\n&gt;&gt; But Don, when we're looking at\nthat user binary information and\n\n184\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.820\nI made some specific changes, would that\nbe applied to all users on that system or\n\n185\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.390\nbecause I'm specifically in one\nuser's profile, how does that work?\n\n186\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthese folders that I'm in right now,\n\n187\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.720\nif you make changes here\nit affects everybody.\n\n188\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.280\nAnd we don't always want that.\n\n189\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.690\nMaybe there's some utility in\nhere that for some reason,\n\n190\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.890\nit's just not the latest and greatest.\n\n191\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.380\nI run into this with GCC all\nthe time wherever it's stored.\n\n192\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.730\nThat's the GNU C compiler where I might\nwant to use a newer version of GCC\n\n193\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.240\nthan what's packaged with Red Hat.\n\n194\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.620\nWell if I go in and replace that here,\nit would replace it for everybody.\n\n195\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.590\nI might want to replace it just for me.\n\n196\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.550\nAnd so, if you want to do that,\n\n197\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.270\nmost operating systems support creating\na bin folder in your home directory.\n\n198\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.240\nIf you go into your home directory and you\nmake a folder called bin, it'll pick that\n\n199\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.870\nup, and the next time I login,\nit'll actually add it to my path too.\n\n200\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.330\nSo it'll find utilities, and\n\n201\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.260\nI can go into that folder and\nI can put my version of GCC there.\n\n202\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.480\nAnd then that way, when I run GCCM,\nI run the latest version,\n\n203\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.360\nand other people run it,\nthey run the standard version.\n\n204\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.840\nSo that's yet another place where we might\nhave those administrative utilities.\n\n205\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.890\nNow, all of those are what I\ncall good exceptions, right?\n\n206\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.790\nThere are bad exceptions, bad exceptions\nare where a operating system vender just\n\n207\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.770\ndecides they're gonna\ndo something different.\n\n208\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:22.930\nAnd that happens a lot.\n\n209\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.160\nThere's a lot of times where they\njust say, you know what, forget it.\n\n210\n00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.080\nI want to put my stuff somewhere else.\n\n211\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.100\nAnd that becomes a real challenge, okay?\n\n212\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.520\nThere's also other options, too,\nthat again, Linux is all about options.\n\n213\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.870\nBut if you're writing software for\n\n214\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.370\nLinux, you don't have to\ninstall in these folders.\n\n215\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.940\nIn fact, there's a whole nother\nfolder out there called /opt,\n\n216\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.050\nwhich is where optional software goes.\n\n217\n00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.540\nAnd so if we look in there you'll see,\nlike I have Google Chrome installed, and\n\n218\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.790\nso it is tucked away in here.\n\n219\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.460\nThere's the Chrome binary right\nthere inside of /opts/google/chrome.\n\n220\n00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.830\nNow, that's normally going to be software,\nsoftware that we run as end users,\n\n221\n00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.440\nnot command line utilities and\nadministrative tools.\n\n222\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.430\nBut it could be an administrative\ntool of some sort.\n\n223\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:11.860\nFor example, I use Chrome Remote Desktop,\nand it is parked in here, as well.\n\n224\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.630\nAnd I use that as an administrative tool.\n\n225\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.030\nI manage other machines.\n\n226\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:18.050\nI remote into this laptop, and\nI use Chrome remote desktop.\n\n227\n00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.400\nBut it's located here,\nnot in /user/sbin, or wherever.\n\n228\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.773\nThat's part of what makes\nthis kind of challenging,\n\n229\n00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:28.199\nis locating these commands and knowing\nwhat's on your system cuz there's so\n\n230\n00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:31.815\nmany different places that we can turn\nto find the utilities that we want.\n\n231\n00:11:31.815 --> 00:11:34.785\nAnd that's when we go back to\nthe whole reading the manual part.\n\n232\n00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:38.605\nYour Distro likely has a manual\nthat explains this, and\n\n233\n00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:40.505\na lot of times it'll explain\nsome of the nuances.\n\n234\n00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:44.392\nSo for example,\nI'm in Ubuntu and Ubuntu, for\n\n235\n00:11:44.392 --> 00:11:49.632\nbeing one of my least favorite Linuxes,\nLinuxi, I don't know the plural of Linux.\n\n236\n00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:53.602\nBut for being one of my least favorites,\nthey do actually follow the filesystem\n\n237\n00:11:53.602 --> 00:11:56.882\nhierarchy standard really\nwell versus Red Hat.\n\n238\n00:11:56.882 --> 00:12:00.402\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, the people who\nare probably most influential in creating\n\n239\n00:12:00.402 --> 00:12:02.220\nthe filesystem hierarchy standard,\n\n240\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.230\nthey actually don't follow it as\nwell as some of the other vendors.\n\n241\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.280\nIt's one of those kind of ironic things.\n\n242\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.950\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Here let me bring up a Red Hat system,\nand let me get logged in.\n\n244\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.800\nAll right, so this system is running Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 7, and if I get into\n\n245\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.440\nthe root, notice /bin and /sbin,\nsee how they're light blue?\n\n246\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.750\nOkay, that's because they're not\nactually directories, they're links.\n\n247\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.595\nIf I take a look at the long output for\nthat, I can see where bin is actually\n\n248\n00:12:32.595 --> 00:12:37.645\nsim-linked to /users/bin, and\nsbin is sim-linked to /user/sbin.\n\n249\n00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:39.685\nThe people at Red Hat\nbasically said you know what,\n\n250\n00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:41.375\nwe're tired of maintaining\ntwo different folders.\n\n251\n00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:44.364\nSo let's just merge them,\nand they merged /bin and\n\n252\n00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:49.165\n/user/bin, and\nthey merged /sbin with /user/sbin.\n\n253\n00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:51.495\nOn one hand, it makes it easier on us.\n\n254\n00:12:51.495 --> 00:12:53.025\nOne less place to go for these things.\n\n255\n00:12:53.025 --> 00:12:54.975\nOn the other hand,\nit's not according to standard, but\n\n256\n00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.395\nthey fixed that by putting\nthese simlinks in.\n\n257\n00:12:57.395 --> 00:13:02.970\nSo if somebody tries to go to /bin,\nright, see how it says I'm in /bin?\n\n258\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.910\nBut I'm not cuz /bin doesn't exist.\n\n259\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.160\nIt's actually a pointer that's\nmoved me over to the other folder.\n\n260\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.960\nAnd if I take a look at what's in /bin, so\nsee how my columns end up like m info and\n\n261\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.842\nz whatever that is.\n\n262\n00:13:14.842 --> 00:13:15.970\n[LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.929\nI don't actually know,\nI'm going to /user/bin and\n\n264\n00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:23.180\nI'll pull up the directory and\nit's the exact same information, right?\n\n265\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.368\nBecause one is just linked to the other.\n\n266\n00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:29.240\nI'm in /user/bin but\nI'm seeing the same thing as /bin.\n\n267\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.230\nSo, different distros might\ndeviate a little bit, but\n\n268\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.930\nthey don't dare deviate too far.\n\n269\n00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.450\nBecause if they go too far away from the\nstandard all of the sudden applications\n\n270\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.640\nbreak and when you can't run applications,\nthat's like the death knell for\n\n271\n00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.530\na Linux distro.\n\n272\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.840\nThat's gonna stop people from using it, so\nthey'll usually adhere to the standard and\n\n273\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.160\nthat makes it easier for us to find\nthe applications that are on our system.\n\n274\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.420\n&gt;&gt; So Don, looking at these custom\ntools or these integrated tools,\n\n275\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.320\nwould these be all comprehensive\nin the sense that, hey,\n\n276\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.570\nthis is everything I need to go ahead and\nadminister this system?\n\n277\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.950\n&gt;&gt; Sadly, it isn't, right?\n\n278\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.920\nSo a lot of times,\nthere's tools I can use.\n\n279\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.060\nSo, if I wanna add a user to my system,\nI can use useradd.\n\n280\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.980\nWell, I have to be an administrator\nto do it, but I can run it.\n\n281\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.760\nAnd there.\n\n282\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.590\nSo I can run useradd and I can add\na user to the system and that's nice.\n\n283\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.210\nSo if I wanna manage users that may be all\nthat I need, or usermod or groupadd or\n\n284\n00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.200\nwhatever, those utilities are there.\n\n285\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.470\nBut there's plenty of things on our system\nthat don't necessarily have a tool for\n\n286\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.640\nconfiguring them.\n\n287\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.410\nAnd for those,\nwe have configuration files, and\n\n288\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.760\nthere are tons of configuration\nfiles found inside of Linux.\n\n289\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.170\nFortunately most configuration\nfiles are stored in the same place,\n\n290\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.310\nso you've got one place to go.\n\n291\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:43.280\nIf you take a look on your system and\ngo to /etc, that folder right there.\n\n292\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.770\nYou should see the bulk of your\nconfiguration files stored right in here.\n\n293\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.460\nNow, you're gonna see a mixture of things\nwhen you browse in to this directory.\n\n294\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.660\nYou're gonna see more directories and\nyou're going to see files, so\n\n295\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.710\nI've got a good mixture of green and\nblue here.\n\n296\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.710\nThe blue are directories and\nthe green are files.\n\n297\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.460\nNow when I take a look\nat the individual files,\n\n298\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.250\nsome of these are configuration files.\n\n299\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.090\nSome of them aren't.\n\n300\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.710\nSome of them are placeholders and\nother things.\n\n301\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.060\nSo I kind of wanna run down some of\nthe ones that are more important.\n\n302\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.040\nNow, when we take a look\nat a configuration file.\n\n303\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.020\nMost of the configuration\nfiles end in dot CONF.\n\n304\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.230\nSo you see like WVdial.CONF, right?\n\n305\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.350\nThat's a configuration file.\n\n306\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.280\nHere's another one.\n\n307\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.140\nVconsole.CONF.\n\n308\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.990\nBut other ones don't end in .CONF.\n\n309\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.680\nInstead, they end in RC.\n\n310\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.210\nRC is the old naming convention for\ndoing configuration files.\n\n311\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.920\nSo usually older software,\n\n312\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.070\nsoftware that's been around a long time,\nyou'll see it like that, like vim and vi.\n\n313\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.490\nThe old text editors show as vim-rc and\nvi-rc.\n\n314\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.140\nOr bash,\nthe shell's that's been around forever,\n\n315\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.590\nyou'll find it here\nsomewhere with a bash.rc.\n\n316\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.889\nRight there.\n\n317\n00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:50.474\nThose are configuration files too.\n\n318\n00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:53.737\nNot any different than the .CONF files.\n\n319\n00:15:53.737 --> 00:15:57.320\nJust the newer software Newer I\nmean like the last 10 or\n\n320\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.768\n15 years, they`ll end in .clnf.\n\n321\n00:15:59.768 --> 00:16:02.229\nOthers, though, actually have a directory.\n\n322\n00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:06.057\nIf they have more than one configuration\nfile, the software developers normally\n\n323\n00:16:06.057 --> 00:16:08.947\nput it in a subfolder, so\nit doesn't junk up this directory.\n\n324\n00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:10.142\nIt makes it easier to see.\n\n325\n00:16:10.142 --> 00:16:12.490\nSo for example, web servers.\n\n326\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.194\nIf I install a web server, which I don't\nknow if I have one on this system.\n\n327\n00:16:15.194 --> 00:16:17.380\nI can add one real quick if we need it.\n\n328\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.651\nLooks like I don't, but\nif you have a web server installed,\n\n329\n00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:23.360\nit'll create a sub folder called HTTPD,\nright?\n\n330\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.830\nHTTPD being\nthe Hypertext Transport Protocol Daemon,\n\n331\n00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.162\nthe service that's running\nto actually power that.\n\n332\n00:16:30.162 --> 00:16:31.472\nIn there it'll have it's configuration.\n\n333\n00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:35.280\nSo, you'll see a lot of things that\nend in D because those are services,\n\n334\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.040\nnot programs but\nthere's other things like X11.\n\n335\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.655\nX11 is the window interface for\nmy system and\n\n336\n00:16:41.655 --> 00:16:46.473\nit has a lot of configuration files and\nso if I browse in there,\n\n337\n00:16:46.473 --> 00:16:50.736\nI can see x.org.comf.d and\nif I go into that folder,\n\n338\n00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:55.584\nI can see I have a keyboard\nconfiguration file and that's it.\n\n339\n00:16:55.584 --> 00:16:56.301\nWhat about the rest?\n\n340\n00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.715\nIt's a window manager,\nthere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n341\n00:16:57.715 --> 00:16:58.347\nWhat about a mouse?\n\n342\n00:16:58.347 --> 00:16:59.539\nWhat about anything else?\n\n343\n00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.171\nWell, we maybe running with defaults.\n\n344\n00:17:01.171 --> 00:17:02.970\nAnd with defaults,\nwe don't need a file for that.\n\n345\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.730\nWe just need more overriding the defaults.\n\n346\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.820\nSo here, we`re overriding\nthe keyboard defaults because\n\n347\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.060\nI might need to specify the language for\nmy keyboard.\n\n348\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.810\nIf you have a US keyboard versus a French\nkeyboard versus a Chinese keyboard,\n\n349\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.860\nthey're all different,\nwe have to define that right here.\n\n350\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.660\nThose configuration files going here.\n\n351\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.540\nI don't have a little command\nI can run and do that.\n\n352\n00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.560\nI have to come and\nedit this file and change its value.\n\n353\n00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.780\nSo you'll see that with a lot of things.\n\n354\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:33.820\nIf I wanna change the behavior of bash for\nexample, then I might want to edit.\n\n355\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.300\nI'm gonna edit /etc/bashrc And\n\n356\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.920\nwhen I go to modify that ill see\nsettings that pertain to bash and\n\n357\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.380\nI come through and change these and\ntweak these and modify how it behaves.\n\n358\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:50.250\nSo administering a system is actually\nkind of a mixture of editing files and\n\n359\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.300\nrunning commands so a lot of times we need\nto know particular commands other times we\n\n360\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.690\nneed to know particular files to go to.\n\n361\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.560\nI already gave one example\nof this in a previous\n\n362\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.180\nepisode when we talked\nabout the sudoers file.\n\n363\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.780\nSo, if I take a look at \"/etc/sudoers\".\n\n364\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.170\nThat's the file that lists who is\nallowed to use the sudoer command and\n\n365\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.800\nyou can see who has those permissions and\nwho doesn't.\n\n366\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.350\nYou know, let me,\n\n367\n00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.970\nI'm going to switch back to my Ubuntu box\nis a little easier to see on this one.\n\n368\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.450\nSo, other files that\nare pretty common: print jobs,\n\n369\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.480\nmanaged by printers, managed by\nthe common Unix print system or CUPS.\n\n370\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.550\nSo, if I go into /etc I can\npoke around in here and\n\n371\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.820\nI'll find where CUPS has a directory.\n\n372\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.150\nAnd it needs a directory because\nit maintains configurations for\n\n373\n00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.420\nseveral different printers.\n\n374\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.060\nAnd so we'll see entries in\nhere based on the printers,\n\n375\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.560\nthe PPD folders where my print drivers go.\n\n376\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.210\nSo I've got a whole suite of CUPS command\nline utilities I can run, but then I still\n\n377\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.850\nhave these configuration fellows right\nin here that I've got to rely on.\n\n378\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.030\nSo, Don.\nIn a previous\n\n379\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.520\nepisode you showed us how we can\nutilize cups to go ahead and\n\n380\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.120\nmanage that information through\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n381\n00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.610\nIs there a benefit to doing it here\nin the command line interface?\n\n382\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.660\nDo we have additional features or\n\n383\n00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.320\ncommands that we can run that\nwe didn't have in the gooey?\n\n384\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.970\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n385\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.940\nAnd, you know, there's pros and\ncons for both.\n\n386\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.065\nSo, you're not Usually,\nyou're not gonna be an extremist and\n\n387\n00:19:12.065 --> 00:19:14.340\nsay,\"I'm only gonna do it this way or\nI'm only gonna do it that way.\".\n\n388\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.600\nYou normally kinda find a mixture of both.\n\n389\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.080\nBecause on the GUI side,\non the graphical side,\n\n390\n00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.410\nI've got an easy to use interface that\nI don't have to memorize stuff to use.\n\n391\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.350\nI can just kinda stumble through.And\nI know that when I make a setting in\n\n392\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.750\nthe GUI, I'm not gonna make a mistake.\n\n393\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.140\nCause it's gonna make the change for me.\n\n394\n00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.852\nIt's gonna modify these config files.\n\n395\n00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:36.558\nThat's all good but\nyou see a very simplified interface.\n\n396\n00:19:36.558 --> 00:19:40.240\nThe graphical interface doesn't\nhave every single feature.\n\n397\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.260\nWhen I drop to the command line,\nI go in these config files,\n\n398\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.920\nI have every single feature\npossible to configure the full set.\n\n399\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.220\nBut boy, there's no [CROSSTALK] If\nyou make a mistake, you make a typo,\n\n400\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.023\nyou could break the surface.\n\n401\n00:19:53.023 --> 00:19:55.690\nYeah, the surface and\nthen it's not going to work.\n\n402\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.150\nYou could damage something you\n\n403\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.720\ncan set something improperly\nthen it just doesn't work.\n\n404\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.810\nMaybe I set it so\nthe printer defaults to duplexing but\n\n405\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.360\nwhen I print its still\nprinting single sided.\n\n406\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.770\nAnd its because I made a typo and\ndon't know it, right?\n\n407\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.960\nI might blame a print driver and\nits actually my fault.\n\n408\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.220\nThat's the challenge we have in the\ncommand line, but you can do so much more.\n\n409\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.150\nAnd services like Cups,\nyou know if we look at this, it's got so\n\n410\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.760\nmany different configuration\nfiles in here.\n\n411\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.090\nFrom the Cups Demon itself, so that would\nbe it's service, to the printers and\n\n412\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.510\ntheir configuration.\n\n413\n00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.440\nWe've got network management for Cups.\n\n414\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.560\nAll sorts of different\nthings that we can tweak.\n\n415\n00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.690\nAnd, when you start to poke\naround inside of them.\n\n416\n00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:42.110\nSo if I take a look at that cupsd.com\nsometimes they're commented really well.\n\n417\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.630\nSo, you come down here and it says if I\nwant to deactivate cups' internal log\n\n418\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.520\nrotating Then we might wanna change and\nincrease our max log size, or\n\n419\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.920\nleave it alone, so it's telling you\nwhat I can do to change these settings.\n\n420\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.580\nSometimes they make a lot of sense,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n421\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.420\nI mentioned in a previous episode\nhow cups has a web user interface.\n\n422\n00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.030\nIf you're never going to use it,\nyou can come right in here, and\n\n423\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.860\nsee this, listen local host 631.\n\n424\n00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.170\nThat's that web interface.\n\n425\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.130\nI can just come in and\nsay I'm not going to use that.\n\n426\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.370\nSo, let me just go and comment that\nout and turn that line off and\n\n427\n00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.970\nnow I'm not going to use it.\n\n428\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.090\nI forgot I was just in\nlast switch as a reader.\n\n429\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:24.400\nI want to edit that file,\nso I need to \"sudo\" that.\n\n430\n00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.060\nThen, I can go in and I can find that\nline that I want to turn off and\n\n431\n00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.470\nI can just Comment it out.\n\n432\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.860\nAnd so now, we're not gonna be\nlistening on that web port any more.\n\n433\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.490\nAnd that will disable that\nif I know to do that.\n\n434\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.020\nIf I go into the printer\nutility in my GUI,\n\n435\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.680\nI don't even have an option\nthat talks about it.\n\n436\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.600\nIt doesn't even mention\nthat I have a web UI.\n\n437\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.280\nBut here, I see it.\n\n438\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.380\nI've got a potential to mess it up,\nbut I at least see it.\n\n439\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.410\nI had a minimum, we may want to\nchange it to a different port number.\n\n440\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.160\nSo, it's not listing on a predictable port\nthat somebody else might be able to see\n\n441\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.780\nand manipulate.\n\n442\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.240\nNow, a couple other things in here,\n\n443\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.680\nthere's a folder called sysconfig that has\na lot of interesting stuff inside of it.\n\n444\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.760\nUsually, your network configuration\nwill be found in there.\n\n445\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.270\nNow, on a boon too system, they actually\ndon't use a sysconfig folder so\n\n446\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.320\nit's not showing up.\n\n447\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.160\nBut on a Red Hat system, which I\nstill have parked in the background,\n\n448\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.950\nlet me pull that one back up.\n\n449\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.590\nIf we take a look at this Red Hat system\nit'll have a sysconfig folder and\n\n450\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.660\nin the Red Hat world,\nthere we go, slash etc slash\n\n451\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.930\nsysconfig contains a ton of information\nthat pertains to how our hardware and\n\n452\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.600\nour operating system is behaving.\n\n453\n00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.870\nUsually when I jump in here what I'm\nlooking for is network scripts, that your\n\n454\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.110\nnetwork adaptor is configured based on\nscripts that are found right in here.\n\n455\n00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.430\nSo, I can see my network adaptor defined\nright in here, and it will be set for\n\n456\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.850\nDHCP or static IP.\n\n457\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.380\nThese things are tucked away in here,\n\n458\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.610\nand when the system boots up, its running\nthese scripts to configure the system.\n\n459\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.400\nThat's a pretty important place to go.\n\n460\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.510\nBut, notice how I have\nit here on Red Hat But\n\n461\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.300\nback under ubuntu I don't\nhave a sysconfig folder.\n\n462\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.130\nI've got a syscontrol.conf which\nis similar but it's not the same.\n\n463\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:06.530\nAnd the reason we don't have it here is\nthat ubuntu is more fully embraced systemd\n\n464\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.570\nthan Then Red Hat has, and so\nit's using system D to manage all that.\n\n465\n00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.820\nAnd I'll see system B right beneath that.\n\n466\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.100\nAnd so it's got where it's pulling\nnetwork configuration from there and\n\n467\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.200\na few other things.\n\n468\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.748\nYou also have the network manager\nwhich is present in Red Hat as\n\n469\n00:23:20.748 --> 00:23:22.668\nwell that's controlling network adaptors.\n\n470\n00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:25.790\nSo, there's more than one way to\nconfigure my network adaptor and\n\n471\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.921\nI've got configuration files for each one.\n\n472\n00:23:27.921 --> 00:23:31.468\nFrom the command line, if I know exactly\nwhich configuration file I'm looking for,\n\n473\n00:23:31.468 --> 00:23:32.190\nthen great.\n\n474\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.136\nI can jump in and I can fix things.\n\n475\n00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:36.208\nBut, if I don't, then how do I know?\n\n476\n00:23:36.208 --> 00:23:37.608\nAm I using network manager?\n\n477\n00:23:37.608 --> 00:23:38.649\nAm I using system D?\n\n478\n00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:43.527\nOr am I using sysconfig scrips to\nactually configure my network adapter.\n\n479\n00:23:43.527 --> 00:23:44.376\nIt gets confusing.\n\n480\n00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:44.990\nIt gets challenging.\n\n481\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.463\nSo, that's one of the big challenges\nwe have on the command line.\n\n482\n00:23:47.463 --> 00:23:53.370\nSo, when we do get the full access to\nconfigure things If is tough, right?\n\n483\n00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.030\nAnd let me just show you one more example.\n\n484\n00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.660\nI have a whole list that'll be in\nthe show notes for you guys, but only so\n\n485\n00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.330\nmuch time in the show.\n\n486\n00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:07.000\nSo let me just show you one more, and if\nwe want to look at, let's do /etc/rsyslog.\n\n487\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.880\nOur syslog is the remote syslog service,\nany log message that's generated on your\n\n488\n00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.460\nsystem goes into a log file and then\nit can even be shipped somewhere else.\n\n489\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.820\nAnd so when I come in here,\n\n490\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.040\nthis is where I can configure\nthe shipped somewhere else part, right?\n\n491\n00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.250\nSo if I wanna to actually have that\ngive output to another service\n\n492\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.680\nsomewhere I can come in to find that\nserver And now we send it another place.\n\n493\n00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:32.070\nBy default it's just sending it to a log\nfile inside of slash var slash spool.\n\n494\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.430\nYou could actually be sending\nit to another server entirely.\n\n495\n00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.700\nSo those are all great ways to do that- So\nbasically that would\n\n496\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.040\nbe like sending a bunch of logging\ninformation perhaps for someone else to\n\n497\n00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.610\neven debug if it was outside of your scope\nand you aren't familiar with an issue.\n\n498\n00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.205\nlike help I don't know\nwhat's going on here.\n\n499\n00:24:48.205 --> 00:24:50.340\n[laughs]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely and Cherokee,\n\n500\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.779\nlogs are something that I\ndefinitely want to talk about.\n\n501\n00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:55.646\nWe probably don't have\nenough time in this episode,\n\n502\n00:24:55.646 --> 00:24:57.144\nwe'll probably need to go into a part two.\n\n503\n00:24:57.144 --> 00:25:01.636\nWhen we talk about system administration,\nthere's commands, there's config files and\n\n504\n00:25:01.636 --> 00:25:02.462\nthere's logs.\n\n505\n00:25:02.462 --> 00:25:06.032\nThose three things go hand in hand\nto allow us to administer a system.\n\n506\n00:25:06.032 --> 00:25:09.850\nWe need commands to be able to execute\nchange and activities on the system.\n\n507\n00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.330\nWe need config files so\nthat our system knows how to behave.\n\n508\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.600\nAnd then when you log files, so\nthat we can trouble shoot things.\n\n509\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.110\nSo with every program, with every utility\nwe really have all three of those pieces.\n\n510\n00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.530\nAnd we talked about the commands and\nwhere they are and\n\n511\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.580\nwe just saw the config files and\nwhere they reside.\n\n512\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.830\nI do wanna talk about log messages, which\nare all tucked away yet another folder.\n\n513\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.760\nBut I think the best thing to do\nhere is to say that for a part two.\n\n514\n00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.390\nThat way I can spend a little bit of time\nbecause you need to know how to view those\n\n515\n00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.100\nlog files and parse through them and\nget the information out of\n\n516\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.280\nTo help troubleshooting, but, we will\nget a chance to see that in part two.\n\n517\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.493\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan Don,\nbut thank you for\n\n518\n00:25:44.493 --> 00:25:47.561\neverything you have shown us in this\nepisode, but you heard it ladies and\n\n519\n00:25:47.561 --> 00:25:49.941\ngentlemen, stay tuned there’s\ngoing to be a part two.\n\n520\n00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:51.823\nFor this show, I’ll go ahead and sign out.\n\n521\n00:25:51.823 --> 00:25:54.371\nRemember, I’m your host Cherokee Boost\n&gt;&gt; And I’m Don Pizet.\n\n522\n00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:57.994\n&gt;&gt; See you next time

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.578\nWelcome to ITProTV, I’m your host Don.\n\n2\n00:00:01.578 --> 00:00:02.796\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:07.698\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:10.818\n&gt;&gt; You’re watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:15.475\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to becoming\na Linux System Administrator series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.423\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:20.237\nIn this episode we're really take\na look at configuring hardware.\n\n8\n00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:23.503\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:24.575\nHow's it going Don?\n\n10\n00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:27.726\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Cherokee ready to\ndive right back in to the world of Linux,\n\n11\n00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.928\nand like you said, we're gonna take a look\nat how we can get our hardware up in\n\n12\n00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:32.575\nfunctioning inside of Linux OS.\n\n13\n00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.245\nSo a little bit different than other\noperating systems that are out there.\n\n14\n00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:38.690\nSo you might have things that you're used\nto here we just have things a little\n\n15\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.220\nbit different.\n\n16\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.250\nAnd we may need to make sure to ensure\nthat everything is working properly and\n\n17\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.090\nthat we're up and going so that's what\nwe've got right here in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.326\n&gt;&gt; All right Don looking at those\nintricacies, what is actually involved in\n\n19\n00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:51.158\ngetting the hardware up and\nrunning in this Linux environment?\n\n20\n00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.430\n&gt;&gt; All right this is probably one of\nthe biggest areas where people get really\n\n21\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.818\nnervous about running Linux.\n\n22\n00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:59.764\nSo maybe you've used Mac OS for a long,\nlong time, and in the Mac world,\n\n23\n00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:03.849\nApple crafts their operating systems\nspecifically for their hardware and\n\n24\n00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:05.362\nthat's all they support.\n\n25\n00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.257\nSo you know all the hardware\nworks out of the box.\n\n26\n00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:13.088\nIn the Windows world, Microsoft spends\na ton of money making sure there's drivers\n\n27\n00:01:13.088 --> 00:01:17.600\nand software available to make sure\nthat hardware functions on Windows.\n\n28\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.950\nAnd even the hardware manufacturers, they\nare willing to spend the money to make\n\n29\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.590\nsure it works on Windows cuz they\nwanna get that huge market share.\n\n30\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.379\nBut in the Linux world,\nwe don't have either of those things.\n\n31\n00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:31.099\nIn the Linux world, they don't manufacture\ntheir own hardware like Apple does.\n\n32\n00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.129\nAnd they don't have millions upon\nmillions of dollars to spend on drivers\n\n33\n00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:36.960\nlike Microsoft does.\n\n34\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.210\nSo what we're left with is an operating\nsystem that's kind of left to\n\n35\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.020\nfend for itself.\n\n36\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.910\nAnd in the past that was a nightmare.\n\n37\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.570\nOne of the really big challenges of\nrunning Linux in the olden days was just\n\n38\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.687\ngetting your video card to work.\n\n39\n00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:52.457\nThe graphical user interface, the windows\nenvironment, and I mean ex-windows,\n\n40\n00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:53.878\nnot Microsoft Windows.\n\n41\n00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:56.930\nBut the ex-windows environment\ninside of Linux that if it\n\n42\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.730\ndidn't support your graphics adapter\nyou couldn't get it working and\n\n43\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.200\nnow you were stuck in the command line.\n\n44\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260\nSo that was a big challenge and\na big deterrent and\n\n45\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.200\nit's why we didn't see Linux take\nhold on the desktop environment.\n\n46\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.604\nIt focused more on the server side\nwhere you don't need as many hardware\n\n47\n00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:11.463\ndrivers to work.\n\n48\n00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.463\nWell a lot of that has changed, especially\nin these last five years where a lot of\n\n49\n00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:19.000\nhardware manufacturers have gotten\non board with supporting Linux.\n\n50\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.351\nAnd the open source movement for\n\n51\n00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:22.510\ndeveloping those drivers\nhas evolved quite a bit.\n\n52\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.087\nAnd so, today, it's actually not\nuncommon for you to install Ubuntu or\n\n53\n00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:31.730\nFedora or one of those distros and\nall of your hardware just works.\n\n54\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.918\nAnd you don't have to do anything.\nYour video adapter works great,\n\n55\n00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:38.041\nyour monitor's picked up, you get full\nresolution, your network adapter,\n\n56\n00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.000\nyour wireless card, all these\nthings automatically get detected.\n\n57\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.420\nAnd they just work right out of the box.\n\n58\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.381\nSo when it comes to configuring hardware,\n\n59\n00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:49.190\nthis could be the shortest episode\never we could just end it right there.\n\n60\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.085\nBut the reality is that some of us do\nstill have hardware that's specialized or\n\n61\n00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.160\nmaybe it's not from a big leading brand.\n\n62\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.721\nMaybe it's from a smaller company\nthat doesn't produce Linux drivers,\n\n63\n00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.430\nand now you're left with the challenge\nof how do I know it's working?\n\n64\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.149\nIf it isn't working,\nwhat do I do to get it working?\n\n65\n00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.930\nAnd how I deal with that.\n\n66\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.090\nSo while it is less common, it is\nsomething we still need to be aware of\n\n67\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.150\nmore so if you're doing desktop support.\n\n68\n00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.350\nYou need to be able to\nquickly troubleshoot and say,\n\n69\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.801\nis this hardware being detected.\n\n70\n00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:19.062\nSomebody calls in and says hey,\nmy webcam is not working.\n\n71\n00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:21.700\nAll right well is the operating\nsystem even seeing the webcam?\n\n72\n00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.710\nIs it a software problem or\nis it a hardware problem?\n\n73\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.530\nTo be able to trouble shot\nthat we've got a whole suite\n\n74\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.720\nof utilities that we can use to look at\nwhat has been detected on the system.\n\n75\n00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.090\nSo we're gonna run\nthrough a lot of that but\n\n76\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.420\njust know that Linux is way more automatic\nand way more flexible than it used to be.\n\n77\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.068\nSo for the most part configuring the\nhardware is a breeze, it's much easier.\n\n78\n00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:43.273\n&gt;&gt; And you know Don, it wasn't just Linux,\n\n79\n00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:46.549\nI even can't remember working\nwith older Windows systems and\n\n80\n00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.896\ntrying to find that network interface card\ndriver before hands so that you're not\n\n81\n00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:55.070\nleft tossed if that was your only way to\nconnect online to get the other driver.\n\n82\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.867\nSo yeah, we don't have to think\nabout those things as much nowadays.\n\n83\n00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:00.440\nIt's more automatic more intuitive there.\n\n84\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.190\n&gt;&gt; And this is where the millennials\nthat are watching this\n\n85\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.655\nshow think were the old codgers,\ncuz doing things like configuring.\n\n86\n00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:07.751\nCherokee you're an old codger.\n\n87\n00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.479\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Don.\n\n88\n00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Configuring things like IRQs,\nthe interrupts.\n\n89\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.080\nHaving ISA and PSI cards and all that.\n\n90\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.024\nAll of them are replaced with plug and\nplay and\n\n91\n00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.025\ntechnologies that automatically detect.\n\n92\n00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:25.466\nAnd now we have USB, USB-A, B,\nC, whatever it is you're using.\n\n93\n00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:29.305\nEach one that is able to\nauto-detect the hardware.\n\n94\n00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:30.305\nThe drivers are built in.\n\n95\n00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:32.555\nIt really is a heck of a lot easier.\n\n96\n00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:37.080\nSo, definitely, I don't look back\non the olden days and think boy,\n\n97\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.838\nI wish it was like it used to be,\ncuz it's way better.\n\n98\n00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:43.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Don, so if I have\nmy hardware installed, how do I know for\n\n99\n00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.470\nsure if it's actually working or not?\n\n100\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.664\nEverything appears to be going great,\nbut how do I verify then?\n\n101\n00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:52.628\n&gt;&gt; All right well,\nwhen your system boots up, there's a lot,\n\n102\n00:04:52.628 --> 00:04:55.770\nwell there maybe, [LAUGH] A lot of\ntext that scrolls by on this screen.\n\n103\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.287\nIn the olden days when you powered up\nLinux, you saw this massive wall of very,\n\n104\n00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:03.444\nvery fast scrolling text\nrolling right by the screen.\n\n105\n00:05:03.444 --> 00:05:06.064\nToday, when you fire up\nsomething like Ubuntu or Fedora,\n\n106\n00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:08.560\nyou usually see a black\nscreen with their logo.\n\n107\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.672\nAnd, so there's just a little\nlogo on the screen and\n\n108\n00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:12.984\nthey are covering up that giant\nwall of text that goes by.\n\n109\n00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:15.315\nWell that wall of text that's\nthe hardware detection,\n\n110\n00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:19.036\nit's looking at all of your hardware, it's\nfinding it, it's initializing it, it's\n\n111\n00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:22.505\ngetting it ready to use for the system and\nthen it's turning it over to the system.\n\n112\n00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:25.960\nAnd then all of your services start and\nyour resources go from there.\n\n113\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.060\nSo that process is actually where we\ncan see if our hardware was detected.\n\n114\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.882\nBut if we don't see it on the screen then\nhow are we supposed to look at that?\n\n115\n00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:36.922\nWell we actually have a utility that's\nfound in the Linux Operating System.\n\n116\n00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:39.510\nLet's us go and look at that bootlog.\n\n117\n00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.054\nSo let me show you here on my system.\n\n118\n00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:43.201\nSo I'm running Fedora 25 and\n\n119\n00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:49.010\nin Fedora in Ubuntu actually this works\nas far as I know in every distribution.\n\n120\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.888\nThere is a command called dmesg and\n\n121\n00:05:51.888 --> 00:05:56.364\ndmesg is what's tracking the dbus or\nthe device bus.\n\n122\n00:05:56.364 --> 00:06:00.160\nThe device bus is,\ntechnically it's your motherboard, right?\n\n123\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.190\nSo all of your devices plug\ninto your motherboard and\n\n124\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.270\nthat device bus is what's\nmanaging all that.\n\n125\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.854\nSo dmesg is showing the device\nmessages from boot.\n\n126\n00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:12.563\nAnd if I just run this I'll get quite\na bit of information and it's gonna\n\n127\n00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:17.526\nscroll by on my screen really pretty fast,\nright, as a giant wall of text.\n\n128\n00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:21.624\n[LAUGH] And this is what we used to see\nwhen you turned on your computer, when you\n\n129\n00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:26.154\npushed that power button, all this stuff\nwould start scrolling by the screen.\n\n130\n00:06:26.154 --> 00:06:31.763\nAnd it's a lot, in fact, I've got my\nscroll back buffer set to 1024 lines and\n\n131\n00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:35.108\nit pushed me pretty close to that limit,\nright?\n\n132\n00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:36.910\nSo it was a lot of data.\n\n133\n00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.266\nBut you can where I ran\nthe command right here.\n\n134\n00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:42.760\nSo I've got D message and then the very\nfirst thing is the Linux Kernel.\n\n135\n00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.988\nSo I'm running\nthe Linux Kernel version 4.11.\n\n136\n00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:48.127\nSo once that kernel is fired up,\nnow it starts going through and\n\n137\n00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:49.700\ninitializing memory.\n\n138\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.250\nAnd so I see all of this stuff where it's\nidentifying what memory is available for\n\n139\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.250\nthe system,\nwhat memory is being used by BIOS and\n\n140\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.180\nwhat's being provided to our system.\n\n141\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.659\nAnd after it gets through\nsetting up memory,\n\n142\n00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.146\nwhich actually does take\na few screens here.\n\n143\n00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:07.510\nThen we're gonna see it start to kick in\nthe regular hardware detection, right?\n\n144\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo here is still memory we've got RAMs but\nthen we get in to ACPI right?\n\n145\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.545\nACPI is the power interface that we\nused to talk to a motherboard so\n\n146\n00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:16.550\nit's initializing communication\nwith the motherboard.\n\n147\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.908\nAnd then from there, it starts to get\nin to the more detailed information.\n\n148\n00:07:19.908 --> 00:07:24.768\nNow, I'm running this on my laptop and\nI have an Intel i7.\n\n149\n00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:28.228\nSo I've got an Intel base system,\nyou might not be on an AMD system and so\n\n150\n00:07:28.228 --> 00:07:30.724\nyou'll see things that\nare little bit different.\n\n151\n00:07:30.724 --> 00:07:34.661\nAnd your BIOS, your BIOS might\nhave been manufactured by AMI or\n\n152\n00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:37.130\nPhoenix or Dell or somebody like that.\n\n153\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.850\nActually I think Dell uses Phoenix.\n\n154\n00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.818\nBut that means your output may\nbe a little bit different,\n\n155\n00:07:40.818 --> 00:07:42.260\nyou're detecting different hardware.\n\n156\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.583\nYou may be on a desktop versus a laptop\nand so I've got a mobile processor,\n\n157\n00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.953\nyou may have a full on Xeon or\nsomething so\n\n158\n00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:52.187\nyou'll see different output\nbased on your hardware.\n\n159\n00:07:52.187 --> 00:07:55.492\nAssuming that Linux is able\nto understand it right?\n\n160\n00:07:55.492 --> 00:07:57.090\nThat it's able to recognize it and\nknow what it is.\n\n161\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.016\nNow when it comes to a CPU It's\ngonna recognize that.\n\n162\n00:08:00.016 --> 00:08:04.020\nWhen it comes to other resources that\nare really critical, it's not a big deal.\n\n163\n00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.620\nBut when it’s fringe type\nthings like maybe you have\n\n164\n00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.660\na flatbed scanner attached or a printer.\n\n165\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.710\nOr some kind of wireless adapter from a\nstrange brand it may not recognize those.\n\n166\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.419\nAnd so as you look through here,\nit's doing hardware detection,\n\n167\n00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:19.885\nand it may throw an error.\n\n168\n00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:23.788\nSo you can look for errors in here where\nit'll say that something is unidentified.\n\n169\n00:08:23.788 --> 00:08:26.089\nSo far everything on\nmine looks pretty normal.\n\n170\n00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:30.268\nNow, I'm still just in the CPU section,\nI'm gonna jump down a good bit, here.\n\n171\n00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:31.964\nHere it's querying the PCI bus and so\n\n172\n00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:34.269\nit's looking to see what\ncards I have plugged in.\n\n173\n00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:36.060\nAnd you know what I'm on a laptop.\n\n174\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.160\nOn a desktop you got PCI slots,\nthe cards go in there, it makes sense.\n\n175\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.472\nOn a laptop, I don't have any PCI slots,\nwell, I don't but I do have a PCI bus.\n\n176\n00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:45.714\nAnd instead of having cards,\n\n177\n00:08:45.714 --> 00:08:49.205\nthe components are soldered right onto\nthe motherboard, right onto that PCI bus.\n\n178\n00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:54.140\nSo they're not actually cards like we\nthink of but they are logically cards.\n\n179\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.800\nAnd so it's doing that it's querying\nthat to see what it can find.\n\n180\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.107\nAnd what it finds,\nit may know what it is, it may not.\n\n181\n00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:03.979\nAnd so as you look, you'll see things,\n\n182\n00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:07.410\nwhere it picks up something like\nhere's slot one, slot one registered.\n\n183\n00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.290\nSo it found the first slot, and now it's\ntrying to identify what's in that slot.\n\n184\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.620\nAnd as we scroll down, it's just\nidentifying, interrupts, and other things.\n\n185\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.736\nAnd then it's finding, right here,\nthat in slot one was a VGA device.\n\n186\n00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:22.640\nSo that's my video card,\nthe video card for my laptop.\n\n187\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.320\nWhich, in all honesty,\n\n188\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.160\nI can't remember what kind of\nvideo card I have in this laptop.\n\n189\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.490\nIt's not a fancy one, so\nit's probably just the Intel integrated.\n\n190\n00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.760\nWe'll see here in a moment\nwhen it identifies it.\n\n191\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.120\nSo right now, it's just doing really\nbasic VGA calls to that card.\n\n192\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.624\nJust to make sure it\ncan render basic text.\n\n193\n00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:39.980\nSo that we can throw that on the screen.\n\n194\n00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.182\nBut in a moment, it's gonna step\nthat up and say, wait a minute,\n\n195\n00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:44.740\nI can actually do a lot more.\n\n196\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.890\nWe'll see that later on\nin the boot process.\n\n197\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.260\nHere it's initializing the USB,\nI just saw it, here it is, USB port.\n\n198\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.590\nSo here it's initializing the USB bus and\nstarting to detect those USB devices.\n\n199\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.550\nAnd I don't have any USB\ndevices plugged in right now.\n\n200\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.730\nSo it's not going to find much, but\nat a minimum, it'll find a USB hub.\n\n201\n00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.182\nThe ports that you have on your laptop or\nyour desktop are a hub,\n\n202\n00:10:04.182 --> 00:10:07.740\njust an internal hub, so\nit's gonna find that too.\n\n203\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.344\nSo what we are really looking for as we\nparse through all of this are any errors.\n\n204\n00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:15.370\nAll that good stuff just goes through,\nidentifies and flags it here.\n\n205\n00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.430\nNow, if you can spot the error, great.\n\n206\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.820\nBut sometimes, there's so\n\n207\n00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.130\nmuch information here that it becomes\ndifficult to find the errors.\n\n208\n00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.050\nSo, what I normally do\nis a couple of things.\n\n209\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.690\nActually, here, I got an error.\n\n210\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.550\nCan't request region for\nresource memory blah, blah.\n\n211\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.090\nThat's not an important error.\n\n212\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.417\nThis is a TPM error,\nTPM is the Trusted Platform Module.\n\n213\n00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:38.700\nI have a security module on my laptop.\n\n214\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.970\nAnd I was running it,\nif you've been watching all the episodes,\n\n215\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.650\njust yesterday I was running Ubuntu.\n\n216\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.070\nAnd I formatted last night and\nput it over to Fedora for today's shows.\n\n217\n00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.240\nSo what happened is I\ndidn't reinitialize my TPM.\n\n218\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.740\nSo it's not allowing Fedora to access it.\n\n219\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.170\nThat's to be expected\nafter you format a system.\n\n220\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.445\nI just need to reinitialize the TPM and\nthat'll fix it.\n\n221\n00:10:57.445 --> 00:10:59.370\nNow if I didn't know what\nthat was I could look here.\n\n222\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.974\nAnd I could see that we got a probe\nthat failed with error -16.\n\n223\n00:11:03.974 --> 00:11:06.320\nI could go in and look up that error and\n\n224\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.670\nget more information on why that\nhappened or what that problem was.\n\n225\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.889\nThat's really kind of part of\nidentifying these types of errors.\n\n226\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.890\nI got a kappa flag index 3\nlarger than supported by driver.\n\n227\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.790\nI actually have no idea what that is.\n\n228\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.750\nBut if I look at the name\nover here I can see iwl wifi.\n\n229\n00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.780\nIt's part of my wireless LAN adapter.\n\n230\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.050\nSo the wireless LAN adapter\napparently has a kappa flag index 3,\n\n231\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.040\nwhich is larger than it should be.\n\n232\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.570\nI don't know what that is, but now I can\ngo and I can look and I can find that out.\n\n233\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.360\nWhen I installed Fedora, I don't know,\nless that twelve hours ago.\n\n234\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.562\nWhen I installed it I didn't install\na single driver, it detected everything.\n\n235\n00:11:46.562 --> 00:11:50.280\nNow, I see this wireless message here,\nbut my wireless is working.\n\n236\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.640\nI am actually connected to\nthe IT Pro TV wireless network.\n\n237\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.032\nI am using it to get on the internet\nright now, so I know that it's working.\n\n238\n00:11:56.032 --> 00:11:59.600\nSometimes these errors are not critical,\nand that's where we might not notice them.\n\n239\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.823\nWe might think the hardware\nis working just fine.\n\n240\n00:12:01.823 --> 00:12:03.806\nAnd in actuality,\nthere is some kind of feature,\n\n241\n00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:06.540\nsome kind of problem that I\nmight not notice right away.\n\n242\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.980\nIt might be that as I walk around\nthe building my laptop doesn't jump\n\n243\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.240\nfrom antenna to antenna\nlike it's supposed to.\n\n244\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.470\nYeah, it connects and it works,\n\n245\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.320\nbut there's one little\nfeature that doesn't work.\n\n246\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.710\nAnd if I didn't look in dmesg I wouldn't\nhave even know that problem was there.\n\n247\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.780\nCuz I connected right to the wireless\nnetwork and it started to function.\n\n248\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.520\nSo that's what dmesg helps\nus do is to identify that.\n\n249\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.430\nAnd I don't normally just sit here and\nscroll through it.\n\n250\n00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.470\nI have strange hobbies, but scrolling\nthrough dmesg output is not one of them.\n\n251\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.240\nSo what I normally do\nis something like this,\n\n252\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.240\nI'll take dmesg, and\nI'll pipe it into grep.\n\n253\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.213\nAnd I'll just look for\nlike the word error.\n\n254\n00:12:41.213 --> 00:12:44.283\nI'm doing -i to make it case insensitive,\ncuz it might be a capital E,\n\n255\n00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:45.420\nit might be a lower case e.\n\n256\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.190\nIt might be all capital,\nI just like to look for the word error.\n\n257\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.894\nAnd then I can jump in real quick,\nand find anything it spots there.\n\n258\n00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:56.364\nThere's the TPM, there's the Wi-Fi and\nthere's an ACPI one that I missed.\n\n259\n00:12:56.364 --> 00:12:57.780\nI must have scrolled by that one earlier.\n\n260\n00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.640\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, yesterday or\n\n261\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.820\nin the last episode, you had shown us\ndifferent ways to use system logs.\n\n262\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.130\nOr even journald to filter\nout these error messages.\n\n263\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.280\nOr even just look at the messages,\nthe information that was retained in log.\n\n264\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.416\nSo is that a viable solution, here?\n\n265\n00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:18.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or would you suggest just using grep?\n\n266\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, so dmesg coupled with grep is\nthe most reliable way right now because\n\n267\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.420\neverybody uses it.\n\n268\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.530\nBut we are seeing this movement, where\neverybody is switching over to systemd.\n\n269\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.230\nUbuntu is on systemd,\nFedora is on systemd.\n\n270\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.740\nAnd so in the future, we're gonna wanna\nuse systemd to look at this stuff.\n\n271\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.430\nAnd so that's part of journal\nCTO which we covered, I think,\n\n272\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.120\nin the last episode or two episodes ago.\n\n273\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.620\nSo if you've been watching this series\nyou've already seen journal CTO.\n\n274\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.210\nBut it lets us look at a lot\nmore than just boot messages.\n\n275\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.050\nIt includes boot messages absolutely.\n\n276\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.960\nSo if I do like a -b I'm gonna\nsee the latest boot messages.\n\n277\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.510\nWhich will be a lot of\nwhat we saw in dmesg.\n\n278\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.550\nSo I'm seeing a lot of the same stuff.\n\n279\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.400\nIf you were to delete this first\n\n280\n00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.870\npart of the line here which you got the\ntime stamp and the origination and that.\n\n281\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.250\nEverything to the right of it\nis what I would see in dmesg.\n\n282\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.740\nSo it's all right here in journald.\n\n283\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.850\nAnd I can do the -xau and\n\n284\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.440\nall that stuff to filter it down\nto see just certain things.\n\n285\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.450\nAnd we can get that same data.\n\n286\n00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.480\nIf you watch this show,\n\n287\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.390\nwe refilm this show two years from now\nthis will be the way I show you to do it.\n\n288\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.990\nBut right now the way that works\non every computer is dmesg.\n\n289\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.810\nAnd two years from now dmesg\nwill still work everywhere.\n\n290\n00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.880\nIt's not going anywhere anytime soon,\nso it's gonna be around.\n\n291\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.560\nThat's the safe way to learn it,\nso that's why I promote that one.\n\n292\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.500\nSo you use dmesg couple it with grep and\nyou can search through and\n\n293\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.290\nfind whatever you want.\n\n294\n00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.700\nAnd you really get the same\nfunctionality as journalctl.\n\n295\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.910\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n296\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Now, when our hardware's being\ndetected there's some interesting stuff\n\n297\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.840\nthat's happening.\n\n298\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.040\nLet me get dmesg back up here.\n\n299\n00:14:48.092 --> 00:14:51.935\nThat really goes back to Cherokee's\noriginal question which I never really\n\n300\n00:14:51.935 --> 00:14:52.543\nanswered.\n\n301\n00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:56.889\n[LAUGH] She said, how do I know if\nthe hardware's actually functional?\n\n302\n00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:00.330\nIf the hardware is detected and\nLinux understands what it is,\n\n303\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.790\nlike the wireless LAN adaptor or whatever.\n\n304\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:08.680\nIf the operating system recognizes it and\nknows what it is, it assigns a name to it.\n\n305\n00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.800\nIn the Linux world,\nreally in the Unix world,\n\n306\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.830\nall of your hardware is\nidentified as a file.\n\n307\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.230\nMost everything is identified as a file.\n\n308\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.300\nSo when you add a USB hard drive,\nthere's a file that matches to it.\n\n309\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.940\nWhen you add memory to your computer\nthere's a file that matches to it.\n\n310\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.850\nEach socket of your CPU there's\na file that matches to it.\n\n311\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:32.446\nAnd all of that is in\n/dev that /deb folder.\n\n312\n00:15:32.446 --> 00:15:37.390\nAnd if you look inside of the /dev folder\nyou'll see all these little names here.\n\n313\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.970\nAnd see how they're yellow?\n\n314\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.120\nYellow is a little bit different\nnormally we expect white for a file.\n\n315\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.080\nOr green for an executable, blue for\na directory, these are yellow.\n\n316\n00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.871\nAnd they're yellow because they're\nactually pointing to hardware\n\n317\n00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:50.227\nnot pointing to something else.\n\n318\n00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:55.859\nSo these are completely artificial entries\nbut they're representing the hardware.\n\n319\n00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:59.474\nAnd the Dev folder is short for device,\nso this is the device folder and\n\n320\n00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:02.060\nwhen you boot your computer\nD message is running.\n\n321\n00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.560\nIt's looking at that hardware and there is\na service in the background called Udev\n\n322\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.580\nand what Udev does is it identifies\nthe device and it assigns a name to it.\n\n323\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.630\nSo if the device is working,\nif we recognize what it is\n\n324\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.919\nyou'd have assigned it a name and\nit gets stuck right in here.\n\n325\n00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:24.590\nAnd that's what we're seeing at the very\nend of D message is each of these\n\n326\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.300\ndevices that are being detected,\nsee how I've got /Dev/VMnet.\n\n327\n00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.864\nOr slash, let's see, a lot of VM net,\nthat one's going crazy, that's my VM,\n\n328\n00:16:33.864 --> 00:16:38.187\nvirtual network adapter, even virtual\nhardware will get a name like this.\n\n329\n00:16:38.187 --> 00:16:44.323\nBut, you'll see other things in\nhere that get those names assigned,\n\n330\n00:16:44.323 --> 00:16:50.264\nlet me just grab that forward /dev and\nsee if we pull anything else.\n\n331\n00:16:50.264 --> 00:16:53.492\nActually, looks like, well the dev mapper,\nthat's mapping to my hard drive.\n\n332\n00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:56.376\nSo we can see some of those hard drive\nentries that got mapped there and\n\n333\n00:16:56.376 --> 00:16:57.540\na few other things.\n\n334\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.490\nBut if you just take look in /dev,\n\n335\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.020\neach of these entries in there\nis pointing to something.\n\n336\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.440\nSo here's /dev/cpu, and\nnotice how cpu is a folder,\n\n337\n00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.700\nit didn't used to be like that\nin the olden days, right?\n\n338\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stick with that theme.\n\n339\n00:17:12.003 --> 00:17:15.862\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm gonna grow a beard,\ncan we do this show from a rocking chair?\n\n340\n00:17:15.862 --> 00:17:17.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In the olden days,\n\n341\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.420\nyou just had one CPU, but\nnow we have multi core CPU's,\n\n342\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.450\nso your one socket might actually\nhave four cores inside of it.\n\n343\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.950\nSo now it's a folder, and\n\n344\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.940\nwhen you go in the folder, you'll see\nall sorts of interesting stuff in there.\n\n345\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.790\nAnd for me,\nI've got an an i7 which has four cores,\n\n346\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.080\nso I see zero, one, two and three, right?\n\n347\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.580\nAnd if i go into one of those, I can see,\nthere's the CPUID and the MSR, and\n\n348\n00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.740\nI can actually start to\nsee the function of it.\n\n349\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.920\nBack here where I have the cores,\n\n350\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.660\nI also have microcode and that's because\nCPUs do way more than they should.\n\n351\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.024\nWell, according to Intel and\nAMD they're bringing a lot of value but\n\n352\n00:17:50.024 --> 00:17:53.563\nthe reality is they're putting a lot\nof crap in processors theses days.\n\n353\n00:17:53.563 --> 00:17:56.965\nLike Intel V Pro for remote management and\nall this graphic acceleration,\n\n354\n00:17:56.965 --> 00:17:59.940\nstuff that should be done outside\nof the CPU they do in the CPU now.\n\n355\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.399\nAnd that's the microcode so I can see it\nright there, the operating system can\n\n356\n00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:06.667\nrecognize that and say, wait a minute,\nI'm about to do AES encryption.\n\n357\n00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:10.339\nAnd this is an Intel CPU and\nit's got AES acceleration,\n\n358\n00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.560\nI know that because\nthe microcode tells me.\n\n359\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.913\nAnd so now when I do that encryption,\nI can call on my CPU and\n\n360\n00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:17.932\nit's hardware accelerated,\nand it's faster,\n\n361\n00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:20.400\nnow I appreciate that,\nthat's a really nice thing to have.\n\n362\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.370\nBut it means the processor is doing\nweird stuff that could be done via\n\n363\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.170\nan acceleration card separately or\nwhatever.\n\n364\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.260\nThose would be listed as\na separate entity in here,\n\n365\n00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.215\nnow other things that we will see in /dev,\nreally important things like floppy drive.\n\n366\n00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:38.505\n/dev/fd, which hopefully you never\nhave to use, instead you're more\n\n367\n00:18:38.505 --> 00:18:45.850\nlikely gonna be using /dev/CDROM or\n/dev/ whatever your hard drive is.\n\n368\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.239\nHard drives can have several different\nnames depending on what type of hard\n\n369\n00:18:49.239 --> 00:18:49.844\ndrive it is.\n\n370\n00:18:49.844 --> 00:18:54.288\nIf it's a traditional parallel disk,\n\n371\n00:18:54.288 --> 00:18:59.404\nright, the old PATA,\nthose'll show up as HD\n\n372\n00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:04.266\nfollowed by a letter followed by a number.\n\n373\n00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:07.710\nHDA would be the very\nfirst parallel drive,\n\n374\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.650\nHDB would be the second parallel drive,\nHDA 1 would\n\n375\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.020\nbe the first parallel drive and\nthe first partition on that drive.\n\n376\n00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.420\nAnd HDA 2 would be the first parallel\ndrive with the second partition,\n\n377\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.656\nwell, most of us have gone to SATA.\n\n378\n00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:29.560\nAnd so SATA discs, the serial ATA will\nshow up as SD, and so if I look in here,\n\n379\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.460\nI've got sda/dev/sda is\nmy second hard drive.\n\n380\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.230\nLet me clarify cause it's showing\nwith an A here, it shows as my first\n\n381\n00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.890\nSATA drive and that's true, so\nI have two hard drives in my laptop.\n\n382\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:50.383\nOne is SATA, one is NVMe, NVMe is\na special accelerated type of solid state\n\n383\n00:19:50.383 --> 00:19:52.600\nthat we're starting to see in devices,\nit can become more and more common.\n\n384\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.430\nI just happen to have both, so if you just\nhave a SATA disk, it'll show up just like\n\n385\n00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:02.269\nthis, SATA, SDA, right, SD for the disk\nand then A because it's the first one.\n\n386\n00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:07.182\nIf I had two, it'll be SDB,\nif I had five, that would be SDA, SDB,\n\n387\n00:20:07.182 --> 00:20:10.040\nSDC, SDD, SDE, [INAUDIBLE] each one.\n\n388\n00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.980\nAnd then the partitions inside it, I have\nthat drive just with one big partition, so\n\n389\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.900\nit's SDA1 but if I divide it in\nhalf then I'd have SDA1 and SDA2.\n\n390\n00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.220\nNow, my MVME, I do have that one\npartitioned, so I've got my MVME disc,\n\n391\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.537\nMVME zero, I've only got one of them.\n\n392\n00:20:26.537 --> 00:20:30.897\nAnd then on it,\nit's got it's main volume which is N1, and\n\n393\n00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:36.214\nthen I've got that broken up into six\ndifferent partitions inside of it.\n\n394\n00:20:36.214 --> 00:20:39.120\n&gt;&gt; Look at you [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.730\n&gt;&gt; It's actually pretty common to\nhave a lot of partitions like that\n\n396\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.230\nwhen you're installing Linux.\n\n397\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.001\nAnd I'll talk about that in\nthe installing episodes and\n\n398\n00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:46.100\nwhy we might have a bunch of these.\n\n399\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n400\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.368\n&gt;&gt; But three of these are actually from\nWindows, I'm set up to dual boot, and\n\n401\n00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:54.888\nWindows has its EFI partition\nwhich we need with Linux also.\n\n402\n00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:57.896\nThen you've got your recovery partition\nand then you've got your operating system,\n\n403\n00:20:57.896 --> 00:20:59.760\nso it's three partitions right there.\n\n404\n00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.950\nIn Linux you're normally gonna have EFI,\n\n405\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:06.340\na swap memory partition and\nthen your operating system, that's three.\n\n406\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.230\nBut it's pretty common to also have\nthings like a home directory and /var and\n\n407\n00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.080\nother things moved off\ninto their own partitions.\n\n408\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.078\nSo you could have 10 or 12 partitions in\nhere that really wouldn't be outrageous.\n\n409\n00:21:16.078 --> 00:21:19.894\nYou look at it, it seems like a lot\nof partitions but in reality,\n\n410\n00:21:19.894 --> 00:21:23.090\na lot of this is automatically\ncreated by the system.\n\n411\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.874\nI didn't actually go in and set up a ton\nof these, it did it for me cuz I'm lazy.\n\n412\n00:21:27.874 --> 00:21:30.911\n[LAUGH] So, there's my hard drives and\nI know they're detected and\n\n413\n00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:33.910\nI know they're present and\nI can even see those partitions.\n\n414\n00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.960\nDoesn't mean I can use them, right,\nI still have to mount them and\n\n415\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.110\nhave access to the file system and\nso on like the Windows partition.\n\n416\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.370\nI might not be able to access that cause\nit's formatted for a Windows system but\n\n417\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.760\nat least, I see it here.\n\n418\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.910\nIf you know the hardware is detected and\n\n419\n00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.600\nrecognized by the operating system,\nthen it should show up in here.\n\n420\n00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.360\nAnd the reverse is true,\n\n421\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.830\nif it shows up in here then it\nshould've been detected by the system.\n\n422\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:58.600\nNow be careful, most of the main\ndistros will only show hardware in\n\n423\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.280\nhere if it was detected, but that's not\nalways the case like this FD right here.\n\n424\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.050\nOkay, does that mean it detected\na floppy disk on my system and\n\n425\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:06.941\nit's ready to use it?\n\n426\n00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:08.580\n&gt;&gt; I hope not [LAUGH].\n\n427\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.165\n&gt;&gt; It would mean I really need a new\nlaptop, no I don't have a floppy drive, so\n\n428\n00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.405\nsometimes they put placeholders in.\n\n429\n00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:18.795\nAnd if there's a placeholder in\nthere it'll show up regardless of\n\n430\n00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:21.105\nwhether the hardware was detected or\nnot, right?\n\n431\n00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:26.055\nSo I don't have a floppy disk but there it\nis, most of this stuff is real, is real,\n\n432\n00:22:26.055 --> 00:22:28.015\nit was detected and it's been seen.\n\n433\n00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:31.795\nBut just because it's\nhere isn't a guarantee\n\n434\n00:22:31.795 --> 00:22:33.600\nthat it's actually there and it's working.\n\n435\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.069\nAnd most of this is mapping the physical\nhardware, but some of this is\n\n436\n00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:42.396\nmapping the virtual hardware like\nmy VMnet adapters from VMware.\n\n437\n00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:46.768\nI've got VMnet 01 and\n8 U random and /dev/random,\n\n438\n00:22:46.768 --> 00:22:50.410\nthose are random number generators, right?\n\n439\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:55.021\nAnd they may be connected to a hardware\nrandom number generator on your system,\n\n440\n00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:57.890\nbut most of us don't have\na hardware random number generator.\n\n441\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.881\nSo if you don't have one,\nthen it's mapped to a logical one and\n\n442\n00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:03.149\nit's a piece of crap and\nyou shouldn't use it.\n\n443\n00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:06.183\n[LAUGH] So that's a problem\nin the security world, but\n\n444\n00:23:06.183 --> 00:23:07.740\nwe don't always have one.\n\n445\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.885\nSo that may be mapped\nwith something virtual,\n\n446\n00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:12.200\nit might be mapped with something real.\n\n447\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.476\nA lot of this stuff you have to\nunderstand that actual technology,\n\n448\n00:23:15.476 --> 00:23:19.020\nlike the random number generator,\nhow do I know if I have a real one?\n\n449\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.647\nWell, I can call the RNGD service right,\nthe Random Number Generation Daemon,\n\n450\n00:23:24.647 --> 00:23:28.798\nand I can tell it to show me\ninformation about its hardware.\n\n451\n00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:33.892\nAnd when I run it, I'm seeing I have\nan available entry resource of DRNG,\n\n452\n00:23:33.892 --> 00:23:38.919\nwhich is a Deterministic Random\nNumber Generator, not a hardware one.\n\n453\n00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:42.208\nIf it was using my CPU then I would\nactually see an entry, you're saying,\n\n454\n00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:45.407\nIntel, blah blah blah, or\nAMD blah blah blah, and it's not using it.\n\n455\n00:23:45.407 --> 00:23:47.929\nOr if I was using the TPM I\nwould see a note in here.\n\n456\n00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:50.499\nHere, but\nright now I'm using a deterministic one.\n\n457\n00:23:50.499 --> 00:23:52.506\nAnd I shouldn't call it a piece of crap.\n\n458\n00:23:52.506 --> 00:23:53.350\nIt's not bad.\n\n459\n00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.600\nIt's, for our use, for\nroutine use, it's perfectly fine.\n\n460\n00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.919\nBut if you're in the military and\n\n461\n00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:01.550\nyou're handling national secrets,\nyou don't want to do that.\n\n462\n00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.210\nSo that's an attack factor, but\nthis is an example though of where\n\n463\n00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.390\njust by seeing /deb /random\nthat didn't tell me anything.\n\n464\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.090\nI actually had to look into\n\n465\n00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:15.090\nthe random number generator itself to\nfind out if the hardware was there.\n\n466\n00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.440\nSo often times\ntroubleshooting hardware and\n\n467\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.790\nidentifying it requires an extra tool\nthat's specialized to that particular tool\n\n468\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.920\nand that's where you're gonna have\nto do some reading on that hardware.\n\n469\n00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.730\nAll right, let's see, what are some of\nthe other ones that you might see in here?\n\n470\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.240\nDifferent vendors have different\nshortcuts they'll put in.\n\n471\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.510\nSometimes you'll see /dev/cdrom,\nso when you put in a CD ROM,\n\n472\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.700\nthat's what it'll map to.\n\n473\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.460\nFedora doesn't do that, so\nI don't have a /dev/cdrom.\n\n474\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.200\nIt'll actually map it to a different\nunique name that I can't remember offhand.\n\n475\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.380\nWe don't see it here cuz most distros\nhave automatic mounting now so\n\n476\n00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.810\nwe don't really care what it gets a name\nfor, but it will turn up that way.\n\n477\n00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.000\nYou may see things like,\nlet's see, what's another example?\n\n478\n00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.900\nSND for your sound card,\n/dev/snd is actually pretty common and\n\n479\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.270\nyou'll see I've got it here.\n\n480\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.380\nThat way software when\nit wants to play sound,\n\n481\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.960\nit doesn't have to know what kind of sound\ncard you have or anything like that.\n\n482\n00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.220\nI can just retry out to /dev /sound and\n\n483\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.700\nwhatever that's mapped to\nthat's what'll play that sound.\n\n484\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.330\nSo it makes it easier for\nsoftware developers to use that.\n\n485\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.745\nAnd here ill see that snd is a folder\nbecause most sound cards have speaker and\n\n486\n00:25:22.745 --> 00:25:26.056\nmicrophone, they do\nmore than one function.\n\n487\n00:25:26.056 --> 00:25:28.877\nWhen a device does more than one\nfunction it'll normally be a folder, and\n\n488\n00:25:28.877 --> 00:25:31.790\nin that folder you'll start to see where\nit breaks things down into all these\n\n489\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.963\ndifferent components and apparently my\nsound card does all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n490\n00:25:34.963 --> 00:25:36.508\nWhich is\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n491\n00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Also not uncommon if you have HDMI\n\n492\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.190\nlike I do on my laptop.\n\n493\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.880\nHDMI is technically another sound output.\n\n494\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.850\nYou might have a headphone\njack as well as other types of\n\n495\n00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.140\nmaybe you've got surround sound.\n\n496\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.230\nSome of those, like the turtle\nbeach adapters or whatever,\n\n497\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.780\nthey have tons of outputs on those things.\n\n498\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.410\nSo you may see things there too.\n\n499\n00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.663\nAnd you may even see some\nlogical sound processors and\n\n500\n00:25:58.663 --> 00:26:03.505\nsome scenarios especially if you have that\nhigh end audio mixing software if you\n\n501\n00:26:03.505 --> 00:26:06.623\nwork in a recording studio or\nsomething like that.\n\n502\n00:26:06.623 --> 00:26:08.689\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're jamming out aren't you?\n\n503\n00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:10.047\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is all default stuff.\n\n504\n00:26:10.047 --> 00:26:12.963\nI honestly had not looked at\nthis prior to this very moment.\n\n505\n00:26:12.963 --> 00:26:17.908\n[LAUGH] So, that's the interesting thing\nis that some of this stuff we don't have\n\n506\n00:26:17.908 --> 00:26:19.080\nto worry about it.\n\n507\n00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.040\nAs long as we hear\na sound what do we care.\n\n508\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.780\nBut then when you go to troubleshoot it,\nall of a sudden you do\n\n509\n00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.280\nhave to really kind of figure out what\nare all of these entries in here?\n\n510\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.520\nAnd obviously some of these hw,\n\n511\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.570\npcm you can start to kind of\nfigure out what it is they do.\n\n512\n00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:39.200\nBut other ones you may have to go and\nlook up and find out and troubleshoot.\n\n513\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.100\nNow the key thing here\nis that all of the /dev\n\n514\n00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.380\ndevices serve one primary purpose and\nthat's to make it where our software and\n\n515\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.850\nultimately the end-user doesn't\nhave to know about hardware.\n\n516\n00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:58.190\nIf I have software and it wants to play\nmusic, It doesn't need to understand\n\n517\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.730\nthat I've got a sound lab, sound card or\nwhatever it is that I have got.\n\n518\n00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.110\nI even don't know what\nsound card I have here.\n\n519\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.270\nIt just have to know if I\ncall /dev/snd I can play.\n\n520\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.340\nAnd then the operating system\ntakes care of the rest.\n\n521\n00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.070\nThe operating system has some sort\nof a hardware obstruction layer.\n\n522\n00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.880\nThe kernel is sitting in between\nthe software and the hardware.\n\n523\n00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.500\nAnd so,\nwhen the software calls this fake file and\n\n524\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.805\nsends a data the kernel takes that data\nand sends it to the real hardware.\n\n525\n00:27:25.805 --> 00:27:28.710\nSo the kernel is what has to know\nhow to talk to the hardware and\n\n526\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.160\nthat's what dmesg is all about.\n\n527\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.300\ndmesg is showing us does\nthe kernel recognize the hardware?\n\n528\n00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:39.940\nAnd if so did it then engage with udev to\nmap those out and make them available?\n\n529\n00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.920\nAll right, now I've got a lot more\nto talk about on hardware detection.\n\n530\n00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.340\nBut I know Cherokee's giving me\nthe signal that I'm running out of time.\n\n531\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.110\nSo let's break this up into a part two and\n\n532\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.590\nin part two I'll show you some more\nthings we can do beyond just dmesg.\n\n533\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.570\nTo locate whether a hardware is working\nand even try and force load some drivers\n\n534\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.000\nand things, we'll get a chance to\nsee some of that all in part two.\n\n535\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.280\n&gt;&gt; All right Don thank you for\nbeing with us today and thank you for\n\n536\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.660\nbeing here as well but for this show\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n537\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.560\nSo we're gonna come back with a part two,\nstay tuned.\n\n538\n00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.280\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n539\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n540\n00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.113\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPro TV.\n\n541\n00:28:13.113 --> 00:28:19.086\n[MUSIC]\n\n542\n00:28:19.086

00:00:10.438\nwatching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:15.575\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Becoming\na Linux System Administrator series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:17.455\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.365\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at how to install Ubuntu.\n\n7\n00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:24.415\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:25.255\nHow is it going, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:26.335\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:29.870\nReady to dive in to what will actually\nshape up to be a pretty exciting episode\n\n11\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.800\nfor those of you who want to learn Ubuntu,\nnot so\n\n12\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.650\nexciting for those of you who don't care.\n\n13\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.820\nBut we're gonna take a look at what\nall is involved with actually getting\n\n14\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.560\nthe operating system installed on your\ncomputer so you can get it up and\n\n15\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.900\nrunning and make use of it.\n\n16\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.990\nIt's really the first step in making\nthat journey into learning Linux.\n\n17\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm already excited because,\nyou know what,\n\n18\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.590\nI've heard it's free, and free is for me.\n\n19\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.930\nSo, that's the first step, right?\n\n20\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.140\nWhere do we get Ubuntu?\n\n21\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.833\nWhere do we get to actually\ninstallation software.\n\n22\n00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.745\n&gt;&gt; All right, so step one of installing\nany Linux distro really is to figure out\n\n23\n00:00:58.745 --> 00:00:59.905\nwho the heck makes the thing.\n\n24\n00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:02.885\nAnd with Ubuntu it's made be\na company called Canonical.\n\n25\n00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:06.525\nAnd Canonical puts out routine\nreleases of Ubuntu and\n\n26\n00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.775\nyou can download it right\nfrom their website.\n\n27\n00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:13.985\nSo their website is actually\njust www.ubuntu.com and I know\n\n28\n00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.925\nit's Canonical is the company and they\nactually do have a dedicated website for\n\n29\n00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:21.060\nthe company but, the operating system\nitself is right there on ubuntu.com, but\n\n30\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.970\nif you look at the SSL certificate\nup there, it's Canonical Group.\n\n31\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.920\nThat's the company that's making all this.\n\n32\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.470\nNow, when you go to their website, they'll\ntalk about a number of the different\n\n33\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.850\nproducts that they offer, but up top\nyou'll see right over here we've got our\n\n34\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.410\ndownloads and you can go in and\nyou can download Ubuntu.\n\n35\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.780\nNow, Interesting thing about Ubuntu,\nyou'll see this on the other distros too,\n\n36\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.390\nis that there's more\nthan one version of it.\n\n37\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.760\nI can choose to install Ubuntu server,\nor desktop,\n\n38\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.720\nUbuntu kylin, alternative downloads,\nUbuntu flavors, what is all this stuff?\n\n39\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.970\nWell, most distros have a server and\na workstation version.\n\n40\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.270\nThe workstation version's great for\n\n41\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.140\ndesktops, because it\nhas a ton of software.\n\n42\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.730\nIt's got a graphical user interface,\nit will usually have Libreoffice.\n\n43\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.810\nA ton of graphical utilities\nto make your life easier and\n\n44\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.630\nto make it a breeze to use.\n\n45\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.770\nMeanwhile, the server installs\nare the exact opposite.\n\n46\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.570\nWhat they have is the minimal features\nnecessary to get Ubuntu up and going.\n\n47\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.690\nBecause you're going to be installing\na web server or a file server or\n\n48\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.610\nsomething like that on there they\nusually don't even have a GUI.\n\n49\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.430\nThat it's straight up command line and\nyou get to work and that's that.\n\n50\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.140\nNot really suitable for desktop use cuz\nit's missing the components we want.\n\n51\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.560\nNow, technically you could install\na server and then add a GUI to it and\n\n52\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.800\nother things and\nyou end up where the desk top is.\n\n53\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.160\nThe kernel, the core operating\nsystem is identical between the two.\n\n54\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.880\nSo it's not like you get in some other\noperating systems like [COUGH] Windows,\n\n55\n00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.070\nthey make it where the server can\naddress more RAM than the desktop or.\n\n56\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.020\nA server can be a domain controller and\na desktop can't, there's all these\n\n57\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.180\nrules that make it where you need to use\na server in some scenarios, in Linux,\n\n58\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.630\nyou don't have that.\n\n59\n00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.970\nThere's nothing a server does that\na workstation can't do and vice versa.\n\n60\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.360\nIt's just not configured that way out\nof the box, they're configured for\n\n61\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.560\ntheir particular job.\n\n62\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.980\nYou can use them whenever you want.\n\n63\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.950\nSo in this show,\nI'm gonna be using desktop.\n\n64\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.430\nBut on the desktop side we have\nto be a little careful here too.\n\n65\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.480\nThis is one spot where ubuntu\nis different than other distros.\n\n66\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.520\nUbuntu has a rather\ncontroversial window manager.\n\n67\n00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.280\nWhen you go to download the desktop,\nso I'm gonna click on that.\n\n68\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.110\n&gt;&gt; How controversial could\na window manager really be?\n\n69\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.825\nIn the lineage world, things have a way\nof becoming super controversial, and so.\n\n70\n00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:32.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] So, what you'll find.\n\n71\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.320\nIs that if you go on the internet,\nand you read forums,\n\n72\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.680\nthe Ubuntu users or\nreally Linux users in general have\n\n73\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970\na tendency to be a little condescending\nto Mac users and Windows users.\n\n74\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.840\nBut then when you get\ninside the Linux world,\n\n75\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.570\nthere's a lot of conflicts between\nthe different distros also.\n\n76\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.590\nThere are people who love Ubuntu, there\nare people who love Fedora and I I try and\n\n77\n00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.530\nkeep it out of my shows.\n\n78\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.580\nBut I can-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why can't everyone\n\n79\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.200\njust get along?\n\n80\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.260\n&gt;&gt; I think I show my colors,\nlike Red Hat and I like Fedora.\n\n81\n00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.700\nSo I use Ubuntu if I have to, but\npeople have their preferences.\n\n82\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.260\nAnd a few years ago Ubuntu\nkind of bucked the standard,\n\n83\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.150\nwhich is most distros used\na user interface called GNOME.\n\n84\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.985\nAnd Ubuntu said you know what, we're\ngoing to create an all new interface.\n\n85\n00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.630\nAn interface that can scale from\n\n86\n00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.150\na laptop to a desktop to\na tablet to a mobile phone.\n\n87\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.560\nThey wanted this one UI that\nwas spread across everything.\n\n88\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.580\nAnd it was called Unity.\n\n89\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.590\nAnd it's actually very\nsimilar to the Metro UI or\n\n90\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.070\nmodern UI that came out in\nWindows 8 that everybody hated.\n\n91\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.190\nWell, everybody hated Unity as well,\nand I shouldn't say everybody.\n\n92\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.080\nPlenty of people liked it but most people\ndisliked it because it was different and\n\n93\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.130\nit had its quirks.\n\n94\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.000\nIt wasn't completely ready yet\nfor the main stream.\n\n95\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.780\nSo, when you go to download Ubuntu,\nif you get the current version as of\n\n96\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.520\nthe filming of this show\nthe current UI is Unity.\n\n97\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.830\nNow if your watching this\nshow after April 2018,\n\n98\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.630\nthe user interface is back to Gnome\neven Canonical recognizes that people\n\n99\n00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.580\nreally didn't like Unity and\nit's support for it.\n\n100\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.780\nSo in the mean time though,\nif your watching before April of 2018,\n\n101\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.510\nyour install of Ubuntu\nis gonna have Unity.\n\n102\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.230\nSo when you go to\ndownload it you also have\n\n103\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.060\nthe ability to download what\nare called Ubuntu flavors.\n\n104\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.610\nAnd if I click on Ubuntu flavors up there,\n\n105\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.360\nnotice how this is telling me\nthe current version is Ubuntu 16.042.\n\n106\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.520\nBut if I go to Ubuntu flavors and\n\n107\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.020\nclick on that I'll see there's\nall these other versions.\n\n108\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.290\nKubuntu, Lubuntu, Mythbuntu,\nUbuntu Budgie and so on.\n\n109\n00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.490\nWell some of these are special\nlike the Mythbuntu is one for\n\n110\n00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.700\nhooking up to a media center to watch T.V.\nand things like that.\n\n111\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.080\nBut the other ones, Kubuntu and\nLubuntu for example,\n\n112\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.580\nthose are just standard Ubuntu 16.0.4\nWith a different user interface.\n\n113\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.380\nIf you wanna use the kde\nwindow manager Kubuntu has it.\n\n114\n00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.990\nIf you wanna use lxde Lubuntu has it.\n\n115\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.310\nIf you wanna use gnome, the one that\nthey're going back to, the one that you'll\n\n116\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.980\nsee in Ubuntu 18, they have Ubuntu\ngnome and so you can download it.\n\n117\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.960\nIt's the same Ubuntu with\na different window manager.\n\n118\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.360\nNow technically, you can download just\nthe regular Ubuntu with Unity and\n\n119\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.610\nadd the Window manager of your choice.\n\n120\n00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.560\nSo if you want to use the one\nstraight from Canonical, you can.\n\n121\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.190\nBut these Ubuntu flavors\nare all officially supported.\n\n122\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.990\nThey're not created by\nthe Canonical team though.\n\n123\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.280\nThey're created by other people and\nthat makes them a little less trustworthy.\n\n124\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.750\nSo in the business environment,\nwe don't normally use these flavors.\n\n125\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.990\nThat if you want\nthe XFC Windows Manager or whatever,\n\n126\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.370\nthen you'll typically install the regular\nUbuntu and then just change the UI.\n\n127\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.300\nSo the flavors are there,\nI wanted to point that out, but\n\n128\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.130\nI'm gonna go back to just the regular\ndownload page because here's where we\n\n129\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.840\ndownload Ubuntu 16 and\nwe'll get that update.\n\n130\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.610\nNow, Ubuntu has a rather\nunique release cycle.\n\n131\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.290\nAnd Cherokee and\nI were talking about it during the break\n\n132\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you explained that and\n\n133\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.910\nit's really interesting how\nthat number actually signifies\n\n134\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.270\na lot of information right\nthere in that release state.\n\n135\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n136\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.600\nSo, when we look at this number, 16.04.2.\n\n137\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.170\nThe numbers not just some made up\nthing like in Windows, and Mac OS.\n\n138\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.340\nYou're running OS 10.12, well great.\n\n139\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.140\nThat doesn't really\nmean a whole lot to me.\n\n140\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.920\nBut this does.\n\n141\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.640\nThis 16 tells me this\nversion came out in 2016, and\n\n142\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.990\nthe 04 tells me it came out in April,\nthe fourth month of 2016.\n\n143\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.110\nUbuntu is on a six-month release cycle.\n\n144\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.090\nThey release a new\nversion every six months.\n\n145\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.110\nThey release one in April and\none in October, and\n\n146\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.220\nthat's why Ubuntu versions\nalways end in .04 or .10.\n\n147\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.540\nThat's telling you whether it was\nthe first or second release of that year,\n\n148\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.560\nthe 16 being the year.\n\n149\n00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.370\nSo right now if you're\nwatching this show live\n\n150\n00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.260\nthe latest version of Ubuntu\nis actually 17.04, right.\n\n151\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.130\nBecause, it is,\nwhat month are we in right now?\n\n152\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.091\nIt's in June.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n153\n00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:57.591\n&gt;&gt; June.\n\n154\n00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.095\n&gt;&gt; June, of 2017.\n\n155\n00:07:58.095 --> 00:07:59.896\nSo, right now, we would be like 17.06,\n\n156\n00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.129\nif they did a release like that.\nBut, they don't.\n\n157\n00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:04.017\nSo 17.04 is the latest release.\n\n158\n00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.023\nBut here I am in the show,\n\n159\n00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:09.480\nwe're gonna do 16.04.\nWhy not use the latest?\n\n160\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.150\nWell there's two releases every year.\n\n161\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.370\nThere's a release every six months, and\n\n162\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.470\nevery four releases,\nthey do what's called an LTS, right?\n\n163\n00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.130\nLTS, is Long Term Support.\n\n164\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.410\nLong term support means they promise\nthey'll support this for five years.\n\n165\n00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.200\nFor five years they'll continue to\nput out security updates, all right.\n\n166\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.060\nIf you're a business you want to make\nsure you're using a LTS version.\n\n167\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.300\nIf you're a home user you don't\nmind upgrading every six months.\n\n168\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.984\nOr maybe you do.\n\n169\n00:08:39.984 --> 00:08:42.880\nMaybe you're a home user and you hate\nupgrading every six months, right?\n\n170\n00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.450\nSo, you'll want to use LTS.\n\n171\n00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.452\nYou still have to do updates,\nright, the security updates, but\n\n172\n00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:50.920\nyou're not having to upgrade\nto a whole new release.\n\n173\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.950\nNow the upgrades are pretty painless, but\nstill, people don't like to do those.\n\n174\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.300\nIf I were to run 17.04 I could do that.\n\n175\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.320\nBut 17.04 is not a long term support.\n\n176\n00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.200\nSo come October when 17.10 comes out,\n17.04 is no longer supported,\n\n177\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.480\nand so now I'm not gonna get security\nupdates unless I go to 17.10.\n\n178\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.700\nSo those are short release cycles, they're\nsix months, if you wanna go longer,\n\n179\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.270\nyou need to go with an LTS version.\n\n180\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.076\nThe current, most recent LTS is 16.04.\n\n181\n00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:24.850\nThe next one will be 18.04.\n\n182\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.920\nSo for those of you watching after April\nof 2018, 18.04 will be the new LTS.\n\n183\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.973\nBut you may be running 17.04 or\n17.10 in between.\n\n184\n00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:39.090\nNow because this is long term,\nnotice that .2 at the end.\n\n185\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.420\nThere have actually been two significant\nupdates to 16.04 since it released.\n\n186\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.150\nAnd that doesn't matter to most of us cuz\nyou'll just get those as part of your\n\n187\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.020\nregular update.\n\n188\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.620\nBut if you're making a CD or\nan install media like we're about to,\n\n189\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.370\nyou wanna make sure you get the one\nwith the highest dot number after it.\n\n190\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.970\nSo it’s got the most updates in there.\n\n191\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.790\nIt'll make the updates go a lot faster.\n\n192\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.320\nBut if I just had a straight\n16.04 disk,it's okay.\n\n193\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.340\nWe'd get the updates as soon as\nI did the updates online, so\n\n194\n00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.250\nnot too big of a deal there, all right.\n\n195\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.420\nAnd if I scroll down on this page here's\n17.04, all right, and we can go on\n\n196\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.020\nalternate downloads and find even other\nreleases and things of that nature.\n\n197\n00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.340\nBut they're gonna promote that LTS\ncuz that's the one that's right for\n\n198\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.810\nbusinesses and this series is\nall about being a sys admin and\n\n199\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.260\nsys admins work in businesses and in\nthe business you want to run LTS versions.\n\n200\n00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.830\nSo, I'm gonna take this one and\nwe're gonna download it.\n\n201\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.860\nNow, when you you download it it gives you\na few choices about what you wanna do.\n\n202\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.550\nFirst off, you can give them,\nthey have a survey that you fill out\n\n203\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.670\ntot let them know what they should\nbe improving and you can donate.\n\n204\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.230\nUbuntu is completely free,\nCherokee mentioned that.\n\n205\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.480\nBut they do ask for donations.\n\n206\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.632\nSo here it's asking us to donate to,\nit's just telling us [CROSSTALK]\n\n207\n00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:49.489\n&gt;&gt; Defaulting to 15 there.\n\n208\n00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:54.150\nFor $15, they could get\na King Kong vs Godzilla on DVD.\n\n209\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.690\n&gt;&gt; It's trying to give you an idea.\n\n210\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.510\n&gt;&gt; Little perks.\n\n211\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n\n212\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.070\nSo if you bump that up a little bit.\n\n213\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:10:59.996\n&gt;&gt; Okay, they're just a comparison.\n\n214\n00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:01.980\nThey're not actually giving you the DVD.\n\n215\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.660\nGot it.\n\n216\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.723\nSo the download.\n\n217\n00:11:03.723 --> 00:11:04.803\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, here we go.\n\n218\n00:11:04.803 --> 00:11:06.142\n&gt;&gt; Cool. All right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's the equivalent of whatever.\n\n219\n00:11:06.142 --> 00:11:07.262\nBut you don't have to see.\n\n220\n00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:07.914\nYou've got right here.\n\n221\n00:11:07.914 --> 00:11:09.639\nNot now, take me to the download, right.\n\n222\n00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:12.443\nIf you use it in your business,\nyou are encouraged to donate to them.\n\n223\n00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:14.310\nThat's what keeps the project alive.\n\n224\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.640\nAnd they do offer support,\nbut it's paid support.\n\n225\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.231\nThat's how they really make their money.\n\n226\n00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:20.594\nSo if something goes wrong,\nyou can call Canonical and\n\n227\n00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:24.408\nthe will offer you support and\nwhatever for a charge, right?\n\n228\n00:11:24.408 --> 00:11:26.650\nThat's how they stay in business.\n\n229\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.160\nNow, when you go to download it,\nit's gonna download an ISO image, right?\n\n230\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.846\nAnd an ISO image is something\nwe can use to make a CD or\n\n231\n00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:36.880\nwhatever to boot off of and\nactually do the install.\n\n232\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.270\nBut that's gonna download.\n\n233\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:44.250\nAnd the download is, if I remember right,\nit's about one and a half gigs in size.\n\n234\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.700\nThere's obviously a ton\nof software available for\n\n235\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.980\nUbuntu that's stored in\nrepositories online.\n\n236\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.012\nBut the installation disk\nitself is not all that large.\n\n237\n00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:53.680\nThe server one's even smaller.\n\n238\n00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.790\nBecause the server one doesn't have a lot\nof the extra software the desktop does.\n\n239\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.560\nBut this one's a pretty decent size.\n\n240\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.948\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're actually installing the desktop.\n\n241\n00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:06.180\nI'm kind of, I'm a little confused as to\nwhy aren't we installing the server side?\n\n242\n00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.200\nAre we able to manage\nservers from our desktop?\n\n243\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.060\nIs that how a system admin\nwould actually be running-\n\n244\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n245\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.982\nUsually that's what you would do.\n\n246\n00:12:13.982 --> 00:12:18.215\nOn a server you want a minimal\nattack surface, right?\n\n247\n00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:20.760\nCuz hackers are gonna target servers.\n\n248\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.670\nThey target desktops too, but servers\nare where the really juicy stuff is, and\n\n249\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.600\nservers are usually exposed to\nthe Internet, whereas, desktops aren't.\n\n250\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.320\nSo you don't want any extraneous software\non a server, you want the bare, minimum.\n\n251\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.140\nSo, if I were to install the server\nversion here, it would be command line,\n\n252\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.070\nit would be very,\n\n253\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.180\nvery sparse and I would need to add\nthe functions that I wanted to it.\n\n254\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.605\nDesktops on the other hand are all\nabout usability, making it easy to use.\n\n255\n00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:44.860\nThey have a lot of extra software so\n\n256\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.960\nthat's why I'm doing\nthe desktop version here.\n\n257\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.880\nBut it would really be\na per use selection,\n\n258\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.330\nit depends on what type of machine you're\ntrying to build, which install you'd want.\n\n259\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see that pretty common now.\n\n260\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.700\nEven having those remote management\nfeatures because that is the way.\n\n261\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.303\nYou don't wanna be back in the day\nusing your old analogy there.\n\n262\n00:13:03.303 --> 00:13:04.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n263\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.213\nyou might have to be working\ndirectly on that machine.\n\n264\n00:13:06.213 --> 00:13:09.163\nBut we're seeing remote\nadministration be more popular,\n\n265\n00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:11.570\nfrom those client side operating systems.\n\n266\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.160\n&gt;&gt; And I can be sitting at\na client SSH into a server, and\n\n267\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.030\nnow it's like I'm just sitting at it.\n\n268\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.760\nI've got the command line,\nI can do all my work, and that's that.\n\n269\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.830\nMeanwhile, I've got a nice GUI, so\nI can fire up a web browser, my email, and\n\n270\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.782\nall the things that I do as\npart of my routine day, so\n\n271\n00:13:24.782 --> 00:13:26.780\nthat's really kind of the key piece there.\n\n272\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.120\nAll right,\nnow once we've downloaded the software,\n\n273\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.290\nwe now have the software to\nbe able to do the install.\n\n274\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.330\nThe power is in our hands,\nwe just need to get it onto our machine.\n\n275\n00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.780\nSo installing is gonna be our next step.\n\n276\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.190\nNow before we can do that though,\nwe need to turn it into a usable format.\n\n277\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.870\nNow I downloaded it before the show,\ncuz I didn't know how long it would take.\n\n278\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.900\nSo let me get into my\nlittle ISO collection.\n\n279\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.513\nAnd let's pull up my Ubuntu installers.\n\n280\n00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:53.790\nHere we go.\n\n281\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.170\nI've got a bit of a collection, because\n[LAUGH] over time, I download ISOs, and\n\n282\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.420\nI just never seem to bring\nmyself to delete them.\n\n283\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.460\nSo you'll see my 12.04,\nwhich is the old LTS.\n\n284\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.230\nIt's been over five years now, so\nthat one`s no longer supported.\n\n285\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.820\nI should probably delete that one.\n\n286\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.071\nBut 14.04-\n&gt;&gt; They`re gonna have you on a digital\n\n287\n00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:13.337\nhoarding episode one day.\n\n288\n00:14:13.337 --> 00:14:15.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like, John, someone needs to intervene.\n\n289\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.120\n&gt;&gt; All these ISO images.\n\n290\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.742\nYeah I know that.\n\n291\n00:14:17.742 --> 00:14:19.214\nI filter this just to my Ubuntu stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:19.214 --> 00:14:21.890\nIf I did my full directory,\nit`s pretty impressive.\n\n293\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.300\n[LAUGH] So\n14.04 is the last long term support.\n\n294\n00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.750\nIt is still technically supported.\n\n295\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.590\nIn fact, it's got what,\nanother year or two left on it,\n\n296\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.790\ncuz they do five years, right.\n\n297\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.310\nSo I could still be running 14.04 a few\nyears from now and still be supported.\n\n298\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.202\nBut 16.04 is the main one.\n\n299\n00:14:36.202 --> 00:14:39.907\nAnd I've downloaded a few\ndifferent versions of it.\n\n300\n00:14:39.907 --> 00:14:42.110\nYou'll see I've got 16.10 and 17.04 also.\n\n301\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.920\nIn fact, if you watch two episodes\nago I was running 17.04 on my laptop,\n\n302\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.340\nthat's what I was running,\nnow I'm running Fedora.\n\n303\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.750\nBut you can see where I've downloaded\nsome of the Ubuntu Gnomes, right,\n\n304\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.570\nbecause I prefer the Gnome UI.\n\n305\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.020\nBut there's Ubuntu MATE, which is\nreally a fork of Gnome version 2, so\n\n306\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.550\nit's another user interface.\n\n307\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.060\nBut those are all just different\nversions of Ubuntu that I've used for\n\n308\n00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.140\nvarious projects.\n\n309\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.960\nBut 16.04 is the current\nlong term support and\n\n310\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.150\nI've got three different versions of it.\n\n311\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.470\nAnd two them are desktop, one is server.\n\n312\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.940\nSo that's kind of obvious there but the\ntwo desktop ones, one of them is AMD 64,\n\n313\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.820\nit's the 64 bit version, and\nthe other one i386 the 32 bit version.\n\n314\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.340\nNow most CPUs today are 64 bit CPUs,\nso you'll want the 64 bit version.\n\n315\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.887\nBut there are some processors out there,\n\n316\n00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:33.903\nsome Intel atoms and other processors,\nthat are still 32 bit.\n\n317\n00:15:33.903 --> 00:15:37.624\nAnd so Canonical steel does release\na 32 bit version, you have to click that\n\n318\n00:15:37.624 --> 00:15:41.400\nalternative downloads link\nto find the 32 bit versions.\n\n319\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.064\nThe thing about the 32 bit version is,\nthe main difference between 32 and\n\n320\n00:15:46.064 --> 00:15:49.595\n64 bit is the amount of memory\nthey can address, right.\n\n321\n00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:54.821\nIn a 32 bit machine, it can only address\nso much RAM, right, four gigs of RAM.\n\n322\n00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:56.677\nIf you have more than four gigs of RAM,\n\n323\n00:15:56.677 --> 00:15:59.070\nit starts to behave a little unusually,\nright.\n\n324\n00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.640\nAnd let me give you an example.\n\n325\n00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.568\nCuz you can have 32 gigs of RAM and\na 32 bit version will see it.\n\n326\n00:16:03.568 --> 00:16:08.306\nBut, no one application can address\nmore than four gigs of RAM, so,\n\n327\n00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:10.820\nif I'm running a database server.\n\n328\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.105\nI need that database server to\nbe able to grab eight gigs or\n\n329\n00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:17.510\n10 gigs of RAM, it won't be able\nto do it on the 32 bit version.\n\n330\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.620\nBut, if I'm just a home user and\nI fire up Chrome, email and so\n\n331\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.230\nforth, each one can be grabbing\nfour gigs individually.\n\n332\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.930\nAnd I could actually start to use\na lot of that memory and it'd be fine,\n\n333\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.940\non a server it would be bad, so most of us\nwant to be running this 64-bit version.\n\n334\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.690\nThere's also some security\nfeatures in other things\n\n335\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.370\nthat are improved in 64-bit and\nit is the way the future.\n\n336\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.498\nBy this point, by the time you're watching\nthis show, you should be all 64 bit,\n\n337\n00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.329\nalready, this isn't like one of those\nthings, hey, two years from now.\n\n338\n00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:44.881\nNo, right now, so\nIf you have any 32-bit stuff,\n\n339\n00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:47.980\nit should be legacy stuff\nthat's slated to be replaced.\n\n340\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.360\nBut there are those versions that\nare still supported by some vendors,\n\n341\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.690\nRed Hat most notably, is the first one\nto say we're killing off 32-bit support.\n\n342\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.400\nAnd so in the newest versions of Red Hat,\nthey don't do a 32-bit version anymore,\n\n343\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.840\nbut this is the version that I\nwant right here, this ISO image.\n\n344\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.050\nNow if I'm gonna do the install,\nI need to figure out how I wanna do it,\n\n345\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.130\nif this is a physical machine,\nI could turn this into a CD.\n\n346\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.668\nAll you have to do is browse to your file\nmanager, right-click on it and choose to\n\n347\n00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:19.862\nburn it, it will burn it to a CD and you\ncan boot off of that CD and off you go.\n\n348\n00:17:19.862 --> 00:17:22.800\nBut the reality is most machines\ndon't have CD drives anymore,\n\n349\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.040\nI don't have one on my laptop, Cherokee,\ndo you have one on your laptop?\n\n350\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.033\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n&gt;&gt; No CD, and you have a giant laptop.\n\n351\n00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:28.171\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n352\n00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:28.722\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:29.360\n&gt;&gt; You have this massive laptop over\n\n354\n00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.963\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; I had it just verified, no [LAUGH].\n\n355\n00:17:30.963 --> 00:17:34.779\n&gt;&gt; So very few of us have CD drives\nanymore, even desktops aren't as likely to\n\n356\n00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:38.790\nhave CD drives anymore because they're\ngoing to those smaller form factors.\n\n357\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.560\nAnd the ones that are built into monitors\nand things, it's just not very common.\n\n358\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.410\nSo normally what we're gonna wanna do is\nbuild something like a bootable USB media,\n\n359\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.320\nso I've got a USB key\nright here that I can use.\n\n360\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.111\nNow if you want to build a bootable USB\nit's actually not very hard at all,\n\n361\n00:17:54.111 --> 00:17:56.821\nthere's a lot of misinformation\non the web on this.\n\n362\n00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:00.335\nAnd so you can run into a lot of trouble,\nso let me help steer it right here,\n\n363\n00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:03.940\nthe first thing you need to do is get\na USB key that's the right size, okay?\n\n364\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.131\nYou need to look at the size of that ISO,\n\n365\n00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:16.005\nlet me just pull this one up there,\nso if I look at that 64-bit one,\n\n366\n00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:20.460\nit's not exactly human readable there.\n\n367\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.562\nBut it's about 1 1/2 gigs, let's make that\nhuman readable there, 1.5 gigs in size.\n\n368\n00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:29.479\nSo if I go and get a USB key, it's going\nto need to be at least 2 gigs in size just\n\n369\n00:18:29.479 --> 00:18:31.538\nto be able to hold the ISO image.\n\n370\n00:18:31.538 --> 00:18:34.233\nCanonical actually recommends you have\none that's at least 4 gigs in size,\n\n371\n00:18:34.233 --> 00:18:37.022\nyou have some extra room there because\nsome files will get expanded and things.\n\n372\n00:18:37.022 --> 00:18:40.623\nSo we wanna make sure we got a USB key\nthe right size, the reality is a 4 gig USB\n\n373\n00:18:40.623 --> 00:18:44.421\nkey, they give those away at trade shows,\nthey're laying all over the place.\n\n374\n00:18:44.421 --> 00:18:47.362\nSo it's usually not hard to get those,\nvery, very cheap, in fact,\n\n375\n00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:50.323\nthis was the smallest one I could\nfind this morning and its 16 gigs.\n\n376\n00:18:50.323 --> 00:18:53.380\nSo plenty of room and\nit's the smallest one that I had, so\n\n377\n00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.687\nyou need to get one that's the right size.\n\n378\n00:18:55.687 --> 00:19:00.136\nSecond, we need to convert this ISO\nimage from being something that\n\n379\n00:19:00.136 --> 00:19:03.818\nwould be used on a CD to being\na partition on this USB key.\n\n380\n00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:06.902\nAnd here's where the real challenge is,\nif you go online,\n\n381\n00:19:06.902 --> 00:19:10.988\na lot of people out there will tell you\nto use this software called UNetbootin.\n\n382\n00:19:10.988 --> 00:19:12.694\nAnd UNetbootin it's great, well,\n\n383\n00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.782\nit used to be great software cuz\nit could write images really well.\n\n384\n00:19:15.782 --> 00:19:19.585\nBut when computers switched over to\nthe new EFI formats and started doing some\n\n385\n00:19:19.585 --> 00:19:23.053\nthings a little bit differently\nUNetbootin didn't keep up the pace.\n\n386\n00:19:23.053 --> 00:19:26.576\nSo now it rarely works, so\nyou got tons of documentation out there\n\n387\n00:19:26.576 --> 00:19:31.430\non the Internet about how to build and\ninstall media, but is it accurate anymore?\n\n388\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.950\nAnd if you use UNetbootin,\nit's rare that your USB queue will work.\n\n389\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.830\nYou'll usually boot and get a black\nscreen or something like that, and\n\n390\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.842\nit's not going to work.\n\n391\n00:19:38.842 --> 00:19:43.012\nSo, I wanna show you some alternative ways\nto be able to build these to know that\n\n392\n00:19:43.012 --> 00:19:47.450\nit's going to work, ConaNaN actually has,\nlet's see, did I actually close it?\n\n393\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:53.230\nOn their website, they actually have some\ntips for how to build the install media\n\n394\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.420\nif you're coming from the Windows world,\nand if you are, then great.\n\n395\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.077\nThey've got utilities and stuff that you\ncan use, there's a little media writer\n\n396\n00:20:01.077 --> 00:20:03.211\nthey have, let me go in, back to-\n&gt;&gt; Okay cool,\n\n397\n00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:07.384\nbecause I'm trying to figure this out, the\nonly software that I have ever attempted\n\n398\n00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:09.348\nto use from the Windows side of things.\n\n399\n00:20:09.348 --> 00:20:13.004\nWould be something called Rufus but\nI normally just like\n\n400\n00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:17.998\nto stay in diskpart because that's\ntried and true and it's proven to work.\n\n401\n00:20:17.998 --> 00:20:20.665\nSo if I haven't had problems with that\nthen why then why do I change to some\n\n402\n00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:21.552\nthird party software?\n\n403\n00:20:21.552 --> 00:20:25.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so I'm familiar with\nRufus and it works in most cases,\n\n404\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.350\nbut I have had some situations\nwhere Rufus didn't quite work.\n\n405\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.740\nAnd so you can run into some problems\nthere, in the Windows world, I normally\n\n406\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.620\nrecommend a utility called Rawrite,\nnow the hardest part is spelling it.\n\n407\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.679\nRawrite32, it's from the NetBSD project,\nactually came out of their environment,\n\n408\n00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:45.062\nbut they have a little Windows\nexecutable you can run here.\n\n409\n00:20:45.062 --> 00:20:49.276\nAnd it will take that ISO image,\nand write it to a USB key and\n\n410\n00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:51.704\ndo a true copy of the partitions.\n\n411\n00:20:51.704 --> 00:20:56.150\nAnd it works every time, so in the Windows\nworld, I recommend using that.\n\n412\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.930\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n413\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.140\n&gt;&gt; But in the Mac world, or\nin the Unix world, and Linux,\n\n414\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.640\nany other distro, there's a utility\nbuilt into your system you can use.\n\n415\n00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.750\nYou don't need crazy software at all,\nyou don't need Unetbootin or Rufus or\n\n416\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.690\nany of these other things.\n\n417\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:12.180\nYou can actually do it with what's already\nin your system using a utility called DD,\n\n418\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.090\nDD is the disk duplicator that's\nbeen a part of Unix since the 1970s.\n\n419\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.494\nAnd it makes perfect bit images of a disk,\nwell, I've already got the image,\n\n420\n00:21:20.494 --> 00:21:24.090\nI just need to go apply it to\nanother disk and we can do that.\n\n421\n00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.440\nSo instead of using software like this,\nit becomes much easier.\n\n422\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.815\nThere is a version of DD for Windows, it's\njust not there by default, but on Mac and\n\n423\n00:21:30.815 --> 00:21:31.457\nLinux, it is.\n\n424\n00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.702\nSo, in the Windows world,\nyou'll just download Rawrite32,\n\n425\n00:21:34.702 --> 00:21:37.184\nI mean you can try Rufus or\none of those other ones.\n\n426\n00:21:37.184 --> 00:21:39.874\nBut, if you download Rawrite32,\nyou run it,\n\n427\n00:21:39.874 --> 00:21:43.492\nit just asks you to provide a source\nISO and then pick your USB key.\n\n428\n00:21:43.492 --> 00:21:45.942\nThen it formats your USB key,\ndrops the image on there, and\n\n429\n00:21:45.942 --> 00:21:47.855\nnow you've got your bootable media, right?\n\n430\n00:21:47.855 --> 00:21:52.115\nBut in the Unix world, if I want it\nto be a little more simple here,\n\n431\n00:21:52.115 --> 00:21:53.203\nwhat I can do is.\n\n432\n00:21:53.203 --> 00:21:59.465\nI can plug this USB key in and then I can\nuse DD to write that ISO image to the key.\n\n433\n00:21:59.465 --> 00:22:02.053\n&gt;&gt; So Don, I actually haven't\nused this DD tool before,\n\n434\n00:22:02.053 --> 00:22:04.265\nis there a way you can show\nus how to use it here?\n\n435\n00:22:04.265 --> 00:22:07.301\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really easy and again,\nthe big advantage is that it's built into\n\n436\n00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:09.145\nthe OS, so\nwe're not gonna install software.\n\n437\n00:22:09.145 --> 00:22:12.927\nSo the first thing we need to do before we\nuse DD is we need to plug in our USB key,\n\n438\n00:22:12.927 --> 00:22:15.330\nwe need to figure out what's it called,\nright?\n\n439\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.871\nRemember, Udev is gonna give us a name and\nI've gotta figure out what's it called, so\n\n440\n00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:21.309\nthe easiest way to do that,\nat least the easiest way for me.\n\n441\n00:22:21.309 --> 00:22:23.469\nIs to leverage our logging system,\nlike D message,\n\n442\n00:22:23.469 --> 00:22:25.441\nit'll show our hardware\nas it gets plugged in.\n\n443\n00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:29.148\nOn every system we have\ntoday it has a system D, and\n\n444\n00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:31.901\nwe can use journal CTL to monitor it.\n\n445\n00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:35.051\nSo on a Mac, I would just look at the last\nlines of D message after I plugged in\n\n446\n00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:36.563\na USB key it would tell me what I had.\n\n447\n00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:39.531\nBut here on my system I'll\njust use journalCTL and\n\n448\n00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.789\nI'm gonna do the dash F at\nthe top to follow it, right?\n\n449\n00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:45.457\nSo it's gonna show me the recent\nlog messages and now,\n\n450\n00:22:45.457 --> 00:22:49.059\nit's just sitting here and my last\nmessage is some service stop, right?\n\n451\n00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:53.064\nSo I'm gonna take my USB key and\nplug it in and when I plug it in,\n\n452\n00:22:53.064 --> 00:22:57.552\nit's going to detect that USB key and\nit's going to assign it a name.\n\n453\n00:22:57.552 --> 00:23:00.134\nSo there it's going,\nI see the log messages,\n\n454\n00:23:00.134 --> 00:23:03.323\nthen right here I can see it\nwas mounted at /dev/sdb1.\n\n455\n00:23:03.323 --> 00:23:08.085\nSo I know the name of that USB key, and\nI can just hit Ctrl+C to stop that.\n\n456\n00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:12.547\nOn a Mac you could do dmesg and\npipe that into the tail command, and\n\n457\n00:23:12.547 --> 00:23:14.829\nyou'll see the last 10 lines.\n\n458\n00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:18.073\nAnd usually in the last 10 lines you'll\nsee where it attaches that disk and\n\n459\n00:23:18.073 --> 00:23:19.854\nthere's that name, SDB, right there.\n\n460\n00:23:19.854 --> 00:23:23.907\nSo one way or another we find the name\nIf you don't see it there, or\n\n461\n00:23:23.907 --> 00:23:28.878\nyou just don't wanna sift through the\nlogs, you could also do a sudo fdisk-l.\n\n462\n00:23:28.878 --> 00:23:32.525\nAnd fdisk is the old disk,\nnot formatting, but it lets you\n\n463\n00:23:32.525 --> 00:23:37.452\nset up the disk partitioning schemes,\nand so -l will show you all your disks.\n\n464\n00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:40.350\nAnd you should be able to\nspot it there by size But,\n\n465\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.330\nthat's a little tricky sometimes because\nwhat if I have more than 1 terabyte drive?\n\n466\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.770\nThings start to get confusing there.\n\n467\n00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:47.300\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n468\n00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.650\n&gt;&gt; So, I don't like to use this\nmethod if I can avoid it, journalctl,\n\n469\n00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.340\nI know exactly which\none I just plugged in.\n\n470\n00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.062\n&gt;&gt; Well, especially server side.\n\n471\n00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:56.281\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, where you may not\neven be in the same room and\n\n472\n00:23:56.281 --> 00:23:57.403\nnow you really don't know.\n\n473\n00:23:57.403 --> 00:23:59.792\nAll right, so\nI know which one's my USB key now,\n\n474\n00:23:59.792 --> 00:24:03.544\nI also need to make sure I know that\nthere's nothing valuable on the USB key.\n\n475\n00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:07.658\nCuz DD is gonna completely erase the USB\nkey, so it's gonna wipe everything out,\n\n476\n00:24:07.658 --> 00:24:08.740\nI'm okay with that.\n\n477\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.606\nSo then I'm gonna say dd.\n\n478\n00:24:10.606 --> 00:24:11.528\nI'm gonna sudo it,\n\n479\n00:24:11.528 --> 00:24:15.028\nbecause you need to be an administrator\nto to mess with partitions, right?\n\n480\n00:24:15.028 --> 00:24:19.590\nSo, I'm gonna sudo it, and I'll say dd,\nand I'll provide it an input file.\n\n481\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.232\nWhere's it gonna get its information from?\n\n482\n00:24:21.232 --> 00:24:25.582\nAnd I'm gonna get that information from,\nwell, this directory, and\n\n483\n00:24:25.582 --> 00:24:28.150\nit's a file called Ubuntu desktop.\n\n484\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.014\nOr, no it's not.\n\n485\n00:24:29.014 --> 00:24:38.710\nUbuntu 16.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso.\n\n486\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.865\nThat's the hardest part of this whole\nthing is typing that long file name.\n\n487\n00:24:40.865 --> 00:24:43.530\nSo, I'm gonna provide that name.\n\n488\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.340\nThat's the input file.\n\n489\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.246\nThen, I'm gonna tell it the output file,\nright?\n\n490\n00:24:49.246 --> 00:24:52.450\nAnd normally when we're imaging a disk,\nour output file would be\n\n491\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.013\nsomething like another file somewhere\nelse, right, I'm cloning it.\n\n492\n00:24:56.013 --> 00:25:02.887\nBut in this case, the output file is\nactually gonna be /dev/sdb, all right?\n\n493\n00:25:02.887 --> 00:25:05.255\nAnd that's gonna word wrap on a bit,\nlet me stretch this out here so\n\n494\n00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:06.510\nwe can see the whole thing.\n\n495\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.670\nThere, all right?\n\n496\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.570\nSo the output file,\nit's a file, /dev/sdd, but\n\n497\n00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.380\nremember in Unix all of our hardware\ngets represented as a file.\n\n498\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.610\nThat's the hardware, that's the USB key.\n\n499\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.660\nAnd I didn't say sdb1,\nthat would be a partition.\n\n500\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.990\nI need to point at the device itself.\n\n501\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.710\nAnd that's because this ISO\nhas its own partitions.\n\n502\n00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:32.150\nThere's partitions inside of it for\nthe EFI boot, for all the files.\n\n503\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.680\nAll that stuff is kind of broken up.\n\n504\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.320\nSo by specifying /dev/sdb like this,\nthat's gonna make sure that it\n\n505\n00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.040\nwrites the custom partitions to that disc,\nif it's got them.\n\n506\n00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.900\nAnd if I stop right here,\ntechnically that's enough.\n\n507\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.182\nI could press Enter and\n\n508\n00:25:46.182 --> 00:25:50.930\nit'll run, but dd does not give\nyou any output by default, so\n\n509\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.430\nyou wont know whether it's doing anything,\nand this command'll take like ten minutes.\n\n510\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.470\nSo how do I know if it's frozen or not?\n\n511\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:03.690\nSo I like to add a little bit more to it,\nI'm gonna add status=progress.\n\n512\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.530\nAnd that's gonna tell it to update\nmy screen with information on\n\n513\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.630\nhow far it's progressed.\n\n514\n00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.970\nIt'll show me how much data it's written.\n\n515\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.440\nAnd, that's a pretty handy one.\n\n516\n00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.710\nNow, this tag isn't supported\nin every version of dd, so\n\n517\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.150\nanother option you can do is to pipe\nthis all through the pv command.\n\n518\n00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.370\nPv will show progress, and\nit's another way of doing it,\n\n519\n00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.080\nbut this way is built\nin in most modern OSs.\n\n520\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.350\nSo, you should be able\nto use this just fine.\n\n521\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.930\nAnd when I run that,\n\n522\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:35.530\nit's gonna start copying the contents\nof that ISO image to my USB key.\n\n523\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.250\nAnd there it goes, it's copying\nabout four megabytes per second.\n\n524\n00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:42.420\nI'm plugged into a USB 3.0 slot,\nwhich seems like that could go faster.\n\n525\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.430\nBut anyhow, it is four megabytes,\nnot four megabits, so\n\n526\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.410\nit's a good chunk of data that's moving.\n\n527\n00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.404\nAnd it's got about one and\na half gigs of data to write and\n\n528\n00:26:50.404 --> 00:26:52.840\nI'm a blazing 100 megs into it right now.\n\n529\n00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.959\nSo it's gonna take 15 times whatever we\njust kinda passed through to get finished.\n\n530\n00:26:57.959 --> 00:27:02.402\nAnd when it's done, I'll now have\na USB key that is bootable media for\n\n531\n00:27:02.402 --> 00:27:06.740\nUbuntu and will be ready to boot\noff it and start our install.\n\n532\n00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.055\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nI see typos being an extreme issue here.\n\n533\n00:27:10.055 --> 00:27:12.265\nBecause you have to really\nmake sure you double-check and\n\n534\n00:27:12.265 --> 00:27:14.455\nmake sure that you have\nthe proper disk selected,\n\n535\n00:27:14.455 --> 00:27:18.705\notherwise there's not really an undo\nbutton or a wait, hold on, oops.\n\n536\n00:27:18.705 --> 00:27:19.315\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n537\n00:27:19.315 --> 00:27:21.105\nThere was no confirmation, it just did it.\n\n538\n00:27:21.105 --> 00:27:23.555\nYeah, you could wipe out\na disk by accident here, yeah.\n\n539\n00:27:23.555 --> 00:27:28.770\n&gt;&gt; All right so once we go ahead and\nwe get this particular USB bootable or\n\n540\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.882\nready to go ahead and\nperform our installation from.\n\n541\n00:27:32.882 --> 00:27:36.558\nThen, we'll proceed with that, but\nDon, I think we are out of time for\n\n542\n00:27:36.558 --> 00:27:39.271\nthis episode so\nwe'll probably require a part two.\n\n543\n00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:39.785\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n544\n00:27:39.785 --> 00:27:40.386\n&gt;&gt; How does that sound?\n\n545\n00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:42.425\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, so in part two,\nwe'll pick back up.\n\n546\n00:27:42.425 --> 00:27:45.070\nWe'll boot off of this USB key,\ncuz it should be done by then.\n\n547\n00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.200\nAnd we'll do the install, and actually\nwalk through the process of installing\n\n548\n00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.382\nUbuntu and getting it on the system.\n\n549\n00:27:49.382 --> 00:27:53.070\nSo, it'll be pretty neat, and we can\ntake our time if we have a second part.\n\n550\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you heard it,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n551\n00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.530\nDon't go anywhere, stay tuned.\n\n552\n00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.640\nFor this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n553\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.610\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n554\n00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n555\n00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.718\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n556\n00:28:04.718 --> 00:28:10.673\n[MUSIC]\n\n557\n00:28:10.673 --> 00:28:13.941\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.028\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.904\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.725\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:17.805\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.875\nAnd in today's episode, it's all about\nbecoming a Linux Systems Administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.045\nAnd joining us in the studio\nto lend his knowledge and\n\n10\n00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.867\nexpertise on that topic,\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.750\nDon, we're so glad to have you again,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.427\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I am excited to be back Cherokee\nand ready [LAUGH] to jump into it.\n\n13\n00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:33.288\n&gt;&gt; Am I Cherokee today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:36.487\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] well,\nyou guys do look very similar.\n\n15\n00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:37.789\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:38.327\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:39.396\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, well Cherokee\n\n18\n00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:41.275\ncouldn't be here for this episode today.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.870\n&gt;&gt; But we are gonna continue right\n\n20\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.742\nwhere Cherokee and I left, which was\nactually getting Ubuntu installed.\n\n21\n00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:49.718\nSo, we talked about what the Ubuntu\n\n22\n00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:55.228\noperating system was, where to get it,\nat ubuntu.com, if I can say it.\n\n23\n00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:56.788\nWe showed how to download the ISO image,\n\n24\n00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:00.530\nhow to create a USB key to\ndo a USB install with it.\n\n25\n00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.330\nAnd we left off right at the point\nwhere we were ready to do the install.\n\n26\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.580\nSo that's where we're gonna pick up today.\n\n27\n00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.680\nWill get a chance to see\nhow Ubuntu gets installed.\n\n28\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.640\nThe different options that we have\nto flip, and switch, and all that.\n\n29\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.480\nAnd then at the end of the episode,\n\n30\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.500\nwe'll hopefully have a fully\nfunctional Ubuntu system.\n\n31\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, well it does sound like fun.\n\n32\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.650\nI am a big fan of the Ubuntu, so\nthat's gonna be interesting for\n\n33\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.290\nme, as well as hopefully for you.\n\n34\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.420\nBut Don,\nI am kinda coming in halfway through this.\n\n35\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.116\nSo, let's get started.\n\n36\n00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Let's continue being started.\n\n37\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.326\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, what we're gonna do.\n\n38\n00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:31.032\nAnd normally we would do this\non a physical machine, but\n\n39\n00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:32.790\nI'm gonna do this in a virtual\nmachine here for the show.\n\n40\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.230\nBut what you would do is you'd basically\ntake the USB key that you made and\n\n41\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.360\nyou'd pop it in the computer that\nyou want to install Ubuntu into.\n\n42\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.550\nNow when you power on your computer,\n\n43\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.270\nmost computers are not going to\nboot the USB key by default.\n\n44\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.540\nIf your hard drives are blank,\nright completely blank, then yeah it may\n\n45\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.070\nboot from USB but it's rare that you\nhave a computer that's completely blank.\n\n46\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.040\nEven when you buy one brand new.\n\n47\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.870\nIt's got some operating system on there,\nprobably Windows.\n\n48\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.440\nAnd so it's going to try to boot to that.\n\n49\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.170\nSo one of the things you'll need to do\nis research how to make your computer\n\n50\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.440\neither boot from USB by default\nwhich you probably don't want.\n\n51\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.720\nOr, to make it where you\ncan bring up a boot menu.\n\n52\n00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.890\nOn a lot of computers, if you press f12\nwhile booting, it'll display boot menu,\n\n53\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.785\nand it'll let you pick which\ndevice you want to boot from.\n\n54\n00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:19.602\nIf you're installing this on a Mac you\nwould hold the option key while you're\n\n55\n00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:22.410\nbooting and it would let you pick\nwhat hard drive to boot from.\n\n56\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.120\nBut other systems might not have\na convenient boot menu like that.\n\n57\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.530\nOther ones just use a different key.\n\n58\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.720\nLike on my laptop its actually f7.\n\n59\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.250\nI have to hold f7 while I’m booting up.\n\n60\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.980\nSo, you’ll need to look at your\nvendor documentation for that.\n\n61\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.890\nThe alternative is to go into your\nBIOS and change the boot order to move\n\n62\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.020\nthe USB key or\nremovable media up to the top of the list.\n\n63\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.630\nNow I said you probably\ndon't want to do that.\n\n64\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.680\nThe reason is there's actually a couple of\ndifferent security attacks that people can\n\n65\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.330\nperform that way if it boots\nfrom removable media by default.\n\n66\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.190\nAnd so now people could\nbypass your operating system.\n\n67\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.150\nWe don't typically wanna do that.\n\n68\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.620\nBut you could do it temporarily and when\nyou're done just go and put it back again.\n\n69\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.704\nSo those are options that are available.\n\n70\n00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:58.140\n&gt;&gt; I know that everyone always\nremembers to go back and do that.\n\n71\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:01.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am certain I have forgotten\n\n73\n00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:01.977\nit many-\n&gt;&gt; Many times.\n\n74\n00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:03.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, many people do.\n\n75\n00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:06.450\nSo anyhow, what we wanna do is you wanna\npop that key and we wanna boot from it.\n\n76\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.400\nSo whatever process it is that\nyour hardware required to do that,\n\n77\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.980\nthat's what you need to go through.\n\n78\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.810\nAnd when you boot,\n\n79\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.490\nwhat you're going to see is what\nI've got right here on my screen.\n\n80\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.910\nSo when you boot off\nthat that removal media,\n\n81\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.020\nwhat you're gonna see is\na screen that looks like this.\n\n82\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.630\nAnd you'll see a couple of splash screens\nthat go by, maybe a little bit of text as\n\n83\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.820\nit starts to initialize the boot\nprocess and run through things.\n\n84\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.340\nAnd remember,\nI'm running this in a virtual machine so\n\n85\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.250\nin the background you've got my\nregular old laptop over here.\n\n86\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.950\nAnd in this little window is\nwhere we're seeing the actual\n\n87\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.600\nUbuntu install happening.\n\n88\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.090\nNow the reason I'm doing this\nis during the installation\n\n89\n00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.510\nthere is a minimal set of\nhardware drivers that are loaded.\n\n90\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.390\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of things that are missing.\n\n91\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.679\nIf I were to do this on my actual laptop,\nI wouldn't be able to mirror my screen for\n\n92\n00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:50.572\nthe recording.\n\n93\n00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:52.820\nBecause the screen mirroring\ndrivers aren't loaded.\n\n94\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.209\nAnd notice how it's a 4 by 3\nresolution but my laptop is 16 by 9,\n\n95\n00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.950\nwell the full drivers for\nthat aren't loaded either.\n\n96\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.031\nSo when you're doing the install,\nit's actually loading a minimal set of\n\n97\n00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.980\ndrivers that it knows will\nwork on every machine.\n\n98\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.490\nSo it might not be the prettiest.\n\n99\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.366\nIt might not take full advantage of your\nresources, but it'll guarantee that you\n\n100\n00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:14.359\ncan at least get the stuff installed and\nthen use it from there.\n\n101\n00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.860\nSo that`s why I`m kind of running it\nhere in a little boxed in window.\n\n102\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.266\n&gt;&gt; Don, I love this that they give you\nthis option to try Ubuntu before you\n\n103\n00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:22.612\nactually install Ubuntu.\n\n104\n00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:25.168\nKind of give you that live environment\nwithout saving anything to your hard\n\n105\n00:04:25.168 --> 00:04:26.760\ndrive, you don`t have to install anything.\n\n106\n00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.660\nAnd if you like it, then you can install.\n\n107\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.520\n&gt;&gt; You know, not every distro does it,\nbut most of the major ones do.\n\n108\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.559\nThey call it a live cd although\nit`s not really a cd anymore.\n\n109\n00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:35.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n110\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.150\n&gt;&gt; But with a live installation,\n\n111\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.960\nwhat it does is it actually\nboots from the USB key.\n\n112\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.610\nIf I choose that it'll actually load\nthe rest of the drivers and it'll try and\n\n113\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.590\ntake advantage of all\nthe hardware I've got and\n\n114\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.010\nbring up Ubuntu without\ntouching my hard drive.\n\n115\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.806\nSo if I have Windows, or\nMacOS, or Fedora, like I do,\n\n116\n00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:57.774\nI could actually boot from Ubuntu and\nnot break my other installation.\n\n117\n00:04:57.774 --> 00:05:02.037\nAnd if I like it and I love it then I can\ncome and install it to the hard drive and\n\n118\n00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:05.924\nif I hate it, I just reboot and\ntake out the USB key, no damage done.\n\n119\n00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:07.870\nSo that's what that's all about.\n\n120\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.720\nI use this not so much to figure\nout if I like a distro or not, but\n\n121\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.460\nto see if I have my hardware support,\nright?\n\n122\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.310\nIf I think I'm gonna need some drivers,\nwell, if I do an install and\n\n123\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.910\nthe network card drivers aren't there,\nwell, now I don't have network access.\n\n124\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.560\nSo I can't go and download the drivers.\n\n125\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.420\nI just lost it.\n\n126\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.860\nSo I might boot from a live CD like this,\nsee if the network card works, and\n\n127\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.880\nif it does, great,\nthen I'll go and do the install.\n\n128\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.390\nAnd if it doesn't, I can reboot back\ninto my other operating system.\n\n129\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.941\nBrowse the network, download the drivers\nand have them ready ahead of time.\n\n130\n00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:42.530\nSo that`s another great thing we can do\nthere, all via that live installation.\n\n131\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.900\nFedora does that, Ubuntu does it, Mint,\nDebian does it, but not every distro does.\n\n132\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.470\nMost of the Cent OS disks,\nthe CentOS disks don't give you a live CD.\n\n133\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.570\nRed Hat doesn't give you a live version.\n\n134\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.600\nYou can make them, but\nthere's no official one.\n\n135\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.910\nThis one's official,\nit's part of that installation media.\n\n136\n00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.186\nNow, when we're ready to install it, the\nfirst couple of screens are all centered\n\n137\n00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:07.319\naround your language and localization.\n\n138\n00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.220\nIt's going to default to English\nbecause this is a US company.\n\n139\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.240\nAlthough we were talking before the show.\n\n140\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.170\nUbuntu, the founder Mark Shuttleworth,\nis actually from South Africa and\n\n141\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.038\nthat's where the name of\nthe product came from.\n\n142\n00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:24.330\nUbuntu is an African word, or\n\n143\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.120\nan ancient word for, it was like a friends\nof humanity or something like that.\n\n144\n00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.660\n&gt;&gt; I am who I am because of who we are,\nI think it said.\n\n145\n00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.220\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n146\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.970\nOkay, so it's one of those like\nmulti-meaning type phrases.\n\n147\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.760\nBut this is kind of\nthe back story of Ubuntu.\n\n148\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.580\nBut, when we install it,\nEnglish is the default, but\n\n149\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.090\nthat might not be your default, right?\n\n150\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.250\nSo you can pick whichever\nlanguage it is you want.\n\n151\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.570\nSo that's going to change\nthe user interface.\n\n152\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.208\nYou'll see it's localized\nto a ton of languages.\n\n153\n00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.719\nYou'll see lots of options in here for\ndifferent ones and\n\n154\n00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.310\nthere's more if I were\nto scroll down to them.\n\n155\n00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.660\nBut this isn't the only screen\nthat's gonna ask us about this.\n\n156\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.328\nWe'll see some more based\naround the keyboard, right?\n\n157\n00:06:59.328 --> 00:07:02.813\nAnd in fact, when I booted, you might have\nnoticed at the bottom of the screen for\n\n158\n00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:04.966\na brief moment there was\na picture of a keyboard and\n\n159\n00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.677\npicture of a little person in a circle.\n\n160\n00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:08.838\nThe keyboard icon there,\nif I had clicked on it,\n\n161\n00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:11.670\nwould have let me pick\nan alternate language keyboard.\n\n162\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.190\nNot every keyboard has keys\nin the same place, and\n\n163\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.050\nwe need to make sure we\nchoose the appropriate one.\n\n164\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.368\nFor example, on my US keyboard,\nI can see the letters in the top row\n\n165\n00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:24.244\nare Q-W-E-R-T-Y, so\nwe call that a QWERTY keyboard.\n\n166\n00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:28.920\nBut if I were in France, They have\nAZERTY keyboards it's A-Z-E-R-T-Y, so\n\n167\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.920\nit's a little bit different.\n\n168\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.050\nThe M key on a US keyboard I\nthink is actually a semicolon or\n\n169\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.350\nsomething on French keyboard.\n\n170\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.290\nSo those are variations that we need\nto pick and you can do that back then.\n\n171\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.450\nThe accessibility options are if we\nneed things like a screen reader or\n\n172\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.230\nthe zoom function or other things to\nhelp us with assistive technologies.\n\n173\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.357\nThose are there too as\npart of the installer.\n\n174\n00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:53.119\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose to do the install,\n\n175\n00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:54.209\nsince that's what we wanna do.\n\n176\n00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:57.790\nIf I hadn't chosen the keyboard and those\nother options back at the boot screen,\n\n177\n00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.855\nyou can still do it now.\n\n178\n00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:02.935\nNotice up here in the top in my top\nmenu bar, I've got a little person.\n\n179\n00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:06.136\nAnd that's where I can turn on the screen\nreader, I can turn on braille or\n\n180\n00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:06.880\nhigh contrast.\n\n181\n00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.820\nThese different options,\nsame as back there on the boot screen.\n\n182\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.928\nAnd right here the EN is telling me I'm\nin the english character map right now.\n\n183\n00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:17.230\nAnd I can go to a keyboard layout chart or\ntext entry settings and\n\n184\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.670\nI can modify that and\nchange it if I missed that first screen.\n\n185\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.290\nAnd just for the record,\nI always miss that first screen.\n\n186\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.940\nIt's not up very long so\nthis is easier usually go up here and\n\n187\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.840\nchange it in these settings.\n\n188\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.413\nAll right, when we choose to install,\nit's gonna move forward and\n\n189\n00:08:31.413 --> 00:08:33.640\nit's going to ask some really\nimportant questions here.\n\n190\n00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.744\nThese two questions change\nhow the installer behaves and\n\n191\n00:08:36.744 --> 00:08:40.958\nthese might not always be available to\nyou, so let me run down what these are.\n\n192\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.030\nThe very first one, and I'll zoom in\na bit so we can actually read this stuff.\n\n193\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.970\nThe very first one says,\nDownload updates while installing Ubuntu.\n\n194\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.830\nThis saves time after the installation.\n\n195\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.850\nOkay, if you have a network connection,\neither wireless or wired, it can connect\n\n196\n00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.430\nup, reach out to the Ubuntu servers, and\nif the installer has been updated, or\n\n197\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.790\nif other files have been updated, it can\ndo the updates as part of the install.\n\n198\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.300\nAnd that is great, because sometimes\nthere's bugs in the installer.\n\n199\n00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.390\nAnd it will have them fixed and patched\nbefore you're actually going through it.\n\n200\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.260\nAnd we always gonna do updates\nwhen the install is done.\n\n201\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.690\nSo here,\nit's just gonna do it as part of this.\n\n202\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.100\nSo when we finish,\nwe'll be all up to date and ready to go.\n\n203\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.260\nBut if you're missing network drivers,\nthat's not gonna work.\n\n204\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.000\nAnd if you are just in a hurry,\nyou don't necessarily want to do that.\n\n205\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.460\nIt is disabled by default, so\n\n206\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.820\nwe may need to come in and\nchange that if we want to do it.\n\n207\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.710\nI'm gonna leave it off cuz I wanna\nshow us manual updates after the fact.\n\n208\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.940\nBut if you've got a network connection,\nit's a good idea to turn that on.\n\n209\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.607\n&gt;&gt; Don, is that where it says install\nthird-party software for graphics and\n\n210\n00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:37.292\nWi-Fi and stuff?\n\n211\n00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:42.080\nIs that where we supply it with a USB key\nor something and install those things.\n\n212\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.918\n&gt;&gt; No, this is actually a representative\nof the open-source community, the free and\n\n213\n00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:50.880\nopen-source software,\nthe mandates or whatever.\n\n214\n00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.530\nLinux is a free operating system.\n\n215\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.391\nIt is licensed under the GNU license.\n\n216\n00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:59.666\nAnd the GNU license says that this needs\nto be completely free software that's\n\n217\n00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.270\nredistributable and\nyou can't charge for it.\n\n218\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.770\nSo if Daniel wanted to take Ubuntu and\n\n219\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.010\nturn it into Daniel Linux,\nhe could do that, right?\n\n220\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.130\nHe wouldn't have to pay anybody and\nhe could distribute it and that's that.\n\n221\n00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.950\nBut he can only do that because all of the\nsource code is publicly available to him.\n\n222\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.210\nWell, drivers are not normally\ndistributed in source code form.\n\n223\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:25.093\nSo if I have a NVIDIA video card, I can go\nget the NVIDIA driver blob from NVIDIA.\n\n224\n00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:27.580\n[LAUGH] And I can load it on here.\n\n225\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.430\nThe problem is driver blob.\n\n226\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.120\nAnd that means that it's already compiled\nand we can't see the source code.\n\n227\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.140\nAnd it's not free.\n\n228\n00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.230\nIt's got its own license attached to it\nand we're not allowed to redistribute.\n\n229\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.550\nYou have to get it from Nvidia.\n\n230\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.240\nAnd so they are,\ntechnically under the GNU license,\n\n231\n00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.210\nnot allowed to distribute that software.\n\n232\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.730\nAnd there are some distros,\n\n233\n00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.300\nlike the BSD world, the open BSD,\nwhere they are super strict about it.\n\n234\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.030\nThey will absolutely not allow\nany closed-source software\n\n235\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.151\nto be a part of their distribution.\n\n236\n00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:59.631\nWell, with Ubuntu, they try to adhere to\nthat but the reality is, it is really hard\n\n237\n00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:03.872\nto get your computer up and going without\nsome of these closed source drivers.\n\n238\n00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:08.133\nAnd if you wanna have a good experience,\njust being able to play MP3s and other\n\n239\n00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:13.000\nthings, there are codecs and things that\nare closed source that make that happen.\n\n240\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.120\n&gt;&gt; I remember back in the day when you\njust wanted to watch a DVD on your Linux\n\n241\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.060\nsystem, That was a bit of\nan undertaking to get that to work.\n\n242\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nit's not much different today if you're\n\n243\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.790\na 100% dedicated to being open source and\nfully GNU license compliant.\n\n244\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.550\nBut most of us don't care about that.\n\n245\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.880\n[LAUGH] We just want the stuff to work.\n\n246\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Just give me the good stuff man.\n\n247\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.750\n&gt;&gt; And that's what this option is about.\n\n248\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.470\nIt's saying look,\nsome Wi-Fi drivers are closed-source.\n\n249\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.970\nBut if you're okay with that, we can load\nthem and your Wi-Fi card will work better.\n\n250\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.089\nThe open source version of drivers are\nrarely as good as the closed-source ones.\n\n251\n00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:48.850\nAnd that's even true\nwith companies like AMD,\n\n252\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.610\nwhere they're releasing open-source\nversions of their drivers.\n\n253\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.650\nThey're not as good as their closed-source\nones because that's what they focus on,\n\n254\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.460\nthe closed-source drivers that\nare really supporting the Windows world.\n\n255\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.280\nBut by checking this we're basically\nsaying I'm okay with that because\n\n256\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.710\nI'm willing to give up a little\nbit of that freedom to have\n\n257\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.150\na system that works better.\n\n258\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.859\nOn a workstation, it's a no-brainer,\nwe usually want to do that.\n\n259\n00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:10.163\nOn a server that may be\na little bit different or\n\n260\n00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:14.062\nif I'm building my own custom distral,\nI might not even have this choice like I\n\n261\n00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:17.050\nneed to not do that because\nI plan on redistributing.\n\n262\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.820\nBut that's what this option is all about.\n\n263\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.890\nIt has nothing to do with reaching out\nto the Internet to get this stuff.\n\n264\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.680\nIt has this, actually included on\nthe disc, as part of a closed-source,\n\n265\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.590\nlike separate folder,\nthat is just not considered open source.\n\n266\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.830\nSo that's what that one is.\n\n267\n00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.220\nThose questions can be a little confusing.\n\n268\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.870\nWhen I do an install,\nI normally check both.\n\n269\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.418\nI'm intentionally not checking\nupdates here cuz I wanna show you guys\n\n270\n00:12:38.418 --> 00:12:39.071\nmanual updates.\n\n271\n00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:44.090\nThe third party one, if I left that off,\nthe manual process is pretty boring.\n\n272\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.750\nI gotta go to each vendor's website and\ndownload those drivers and install.\n\n273\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.600\nMuch easier just to let it do\nit as part of the install.\n\n274\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.980\nAll right, we move forward on that.\n\n275\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.730\nIt's going to think for a moment.\n\n276\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.570\nAnd it's because I checked\nthis third party software.\n\n277\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.830\nSo it's looking to see what\nthird party software I need.\n\n278\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.720\nAnd once it gets past that,\nnow it's disk time.\n\n279\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.640\nIt's saying if you're gonna install,\nwe've gotta install to a hard drive.\n\n280\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.900\nAnd so it's gotta figure out\nwhat hard drives I have, and\n\n281\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.870\nthen it's gotta create the partitions for\nit.\n\n282\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.740\nNow, there's a neat little option right\nhere at the very top, which just says,\n\n283\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.500\nhey, we can make this really easy.\n\n284\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.850\nWe can do this the easy way or\nthe hard way.\n\n285\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.340\n&gt;&gt; And the easy way is let's just erase\n\n287\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.186\neverything that's on your\ncomputer right now, and\n\n288\n00:13:20.186 --> 00:13:24.664\nif we erase everything then we can just\ninstall Ubuntu and you'll be in business.\n\n289\n00:13:24.664 --> 00:13:27.693\nAnd if you are dedicating your laptop or\nyour desktop and\n\n290\n00:13:27.693 --> 00:13:30.530\nit's just going to be Linux\nthat's what you want.\n\n291\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.690\nIt'll wipe it out,\nit'll automatically set the partition.\n\n292\n00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.530\nYou don't have to worry about anything,\nand there it is.\n\n293\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.134\n&gt;&gt; Go big or go home.\n\n294\n00:13:35.134 --> 00:13:38.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if you're still\ntesting the waters, if you're well,\n\n295\n00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:42.000\nI've got Windows on here but\nI want to keep it, I want a dual boot.\n\n296\n00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.830\nYou don't wanna choose this first option,\nthat's gonna be a problem, right?\n\n297\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.430\nActually, if I had Windows on here,\nit would detect it and\n\n298\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.440\nit would give me another option.\n\n299\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.800\nI don't have Windows, but we're gonna\ndo dual boot in another episode, so\n\n300\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.980\nwe'll get a chance to see that.\n\n301\n00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.970\nIt also gives me the option to\nencrypt the installation, right?\n\n302\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.860\nOn a desktop, a lot of people don't\nworry about this, but on a laptop,\n\n303\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.140\non a mobile device, it's very easy to lose\nyour device, or have your device stolen.\n\n304\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.240\nAnd if the hard drive is encrypted,\n\n305\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.760\nyou don't have to worry about\nyour data getting lost.\n\n306\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.930\nWell there's a few technologies you'll\nsee later on that let you do things like\n\n307\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.890\nencrypting your Home folder and\nthat's good enough for some people.\n\n308\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.910\nBut this option will actually\nencrypt the entire hard drive and\n\n309\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.650\nthat is the best option.\n\n310\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.860\nI don't care how good your\nencrypt a home folder option is\n\n311\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.870\nencrypting the entire\ndisk is always better.\n\n312\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.190\nSo that's usually the option that we'd\nwant if we're looking for encryption.\n\n313\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.380\nI'm gonna leave that off because in\na virtual machine it actually slows\n\n314\n00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.350\nthings down a bit.\n\n315\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.960\nOn a physical machine though,\nyou'll not notice a difference, right?\n\n316\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.350\nAt the boot, there's just a half a second\ndelay while it loads that private key and\n\n317\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.650\nthen after that you really don't\nnotice a performance difference.\n\n318\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.624\nThen next option is\nwhether I wanna use LVM.\n\n319\n00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:44.581\nWhen you do an install, and\nyou choose to just erase it and\n\n320\n00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:47.108\ndo the install,\nit's typically going to lay out\n\n321\n00:14:47.108 --> 00:14:50.570\na pretty standard partition\nlayout on the hard drive.\n\n322\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.020\nBut, it can choose to use\nthe logical volume management.\n\n323\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.180\nLVM, it's actually a technology that\ncame from outside of Ubuntu but\n\n324\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.690\nthey've adopted it, it allows you\nto dynamically manage your discs.\n\n325\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.900\nIf I have more than one hard drive, I can\nstring them together in a RAID 5 array.\n\n326\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.530\nIf I have two hard drives,\nI can mirror them.\n\n327\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.870\nAnd this is in software, not in hardware.\n\n328\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.180\nSo I don't have to have\nan array controller,\n\n329\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.800\nI can just have two drives and do it.\n\n330\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.300\nI can have one drive and when it gets\nfull, I can add a second drive and\n\n331\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.320\nmerge them together and\nincrease my storage like that.\n\n332\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.600\nI can dynamically shrink and expand them.\n\n333\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.250\nWell on a laptop, or\n\n334\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.970\na system where you have only have one hard\ndrive you probably don't care about that.\n\n335\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.980\nBut on a desktop, where you might be\nadding extra discs, LVM can be really\n\n336\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.460\nhandy, you can really change your disk\nstructure without having to even reboot,\n\n337\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.870\nit's powerful stuff.\n\n338\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.820\nOn a laptop I normally leave that off,\njust because I know,\n\n339\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.720\nI'm not gonna add a second\nhard drive to my laptop.\n\n340\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.818\nI guess I'm saying that\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:44.607\n&gt;&gt; Not a permanent addition to your-\n\n342\n00:15:44.607 --> 00:15:45.523\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have USB\n\n343\n00:15:45.523 --> 00:15:46.325\nones-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n344\n00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:47.765\n&gt;&gt; That get added on, or whatever.\n\n345\n00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:49.029\nBut most of us aren't gonna be adding it.\n\n346\n00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:51.765\nSo LVM is actually off by\ndefault because of that.\n\n347\n00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:53.528\nBut you can turn it on if you want.\n\n348\n00:15:53.528 --> 00:15:56.637\nLVM is one of those things\nwhere It's really powerful and\n\n349\n00:15:56.637 --> 00:15:59.633\nit's a super pain in the butt\nto turn on after the fact.\n\n350\n00:15:59.633 --> 00:16:03.130\nSo if you turn it on now,\nit's on, it's easy, it's done.\n\n351\n00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.330\nBut if you want to turn it on later\non down the road, boy it's tough.\n\n352\n00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.000\nYou basically have to format your drive\nto really get LVM up and going again.\n\n353\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.550\nSo it is a decision best\nmade here in advance.\n\n354\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.830\nAnd [COUGH] lastly I've got\nthis option Something else.\n\n355\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.657\n&gt;&gt; It's just a grab bag,\nwho knows what you'll get right Don?\n\n356\n00:16:20.657 --> 00:16:23.283\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basically what you're doing,\n\n357\n00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:25.058\nthese options up here,\nthese are easy right.\n\n358\n00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:25.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Erase the disk, install Ubuntu,\ndon't make me think about it.\n\n360\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.640\nJust do it.\n\n361\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.540\nBut there are times when\nwe might want to change\n\n362\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.930\nthe behavior of what's gonna be happening.\n\n363\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.290\nAnd so when you come down and choose\nSomething else you'll get more choices.\n\n364\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.270\nYou'll get additional options for\nwhat you wanna do.\n\n365\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.610\nAnd so let me just kind of show you that.\n\n366\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.650\nNormally I would choose erase disk and\ninstall ubuntu.\n\n367\n00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.490\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it is easier.\n\n368\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.931\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's done.\n\n369\n00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:51.190\nBut let me show you this something else.\n\n370\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.820\nCuz it is important for many people.\n\n371\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.640\nAnd this is another thing.\n\n372\n00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.870\nIt's really easy to do now and\nkind of hard to do later.\n\n373\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.250\nChanging your disk partitioning is a pain.\n\n374\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.980\nSo when I continue on that, what I'm\ngonna see is a list of my hard drives.\n\n375\n00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.660\nNow, I'm in a virtual machine and my\nvirtual machine only has one hard drive so\n\n376\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.840\nI see /dev/vda, virtual disk A.\n\n377\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.990\nIf I had more than one hard drive they'd\neach show here, and that's all I'm seeing.\n\n378\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.840\nIt's asking me to pick which\ndisk I want to install on.\n\n379\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.610\nAnd then down here it's asking which\ndisc I'm gonna be booting from.\n\n380\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.470\nSo not really a whole lot of questions.\n\n381\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.740\nWell if I just choose this and\n\n382\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.590\nmove on, it's gonna be the same thing as\nchosing to erase the disc and that's it.\n\n383\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.260\nBut what we normally do is come in and\nwe set our mount points.\n\n384\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.850\nNow mount points are basically\nfolders that will be in your disc.\n\n385\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.560\nAnd there's certain things that\nwe might wanna separate out.\n\n386\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.500\nAnd so I wanna give you guys a few\nscenarios here of things that we might\n\n387\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.150\nwanna separate out.\n\n388\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.300\nOne thing is the swap file or\nswap partition.\n\n389\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.230\nYou have physical memory in your laptop,\nright?\n\n390\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.330\nI've got 32 gigs of RAM in this laptop.\n\n391\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.190\nWhat happens if you run out of ram,\nif you use it all?\n\n392\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.640\nWell technically if you run out of ram and\n\n393\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.740\nthat's the end of it, your computer\nlocks up, that's what happens.\n\n394\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.811\nNow your in trouble.\n\n395\n00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:08.510\n[CROSSTALK] So a lot of operating systems\nwill set aside a part of the hard drive\n\n396\n00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:12.770\nand say if we run out of RAM we can start\nusing this part of the hard drive too.\n\n397\n00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.980\nNow we write to that and\nwe dont run out of memory.\n\n398\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.470\nThat's your swap partition.\n\n399\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.040\nWell, with swap it can grow\nreally big if you're not careful,\n\n400\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.500\nif it's not being managed properly.\n\n401\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.360\nSo if you just put it on your regular\nhard drive and it grows too large\n\n402\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.570\nyou run out of hard drive space, and again\neventuallly you lock up your computer.\n\n403\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.000\nBut if we put it on its own partition,\nthat separates it out,\n\n404\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.810\nkeeps it separate from the operating\nsystem, not we don't have that problem.\n\n405\n00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.490\nWindows has that problem because\nit uses a swap file, but\n\n406\n00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.620\nin Linux we have a swap partition.\n\n407\n00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.380\nAnd so we can come in and\n\n408\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.920\nwe can define that right here, to say\nI've got this little section for Swap.\n\n409\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.250\nOr we can do it with our mount points too,\n\n410\n00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.480\nthat technically I only\nneed one Mount Point.\n\n411\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.305\nThe Root, just /, right.\n\n412\n00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:52.223\nAnd every other folder's\ngonna be underneath that so\n\n413\n00:18:52.223 --> 00:18:53.830\nI just need that one location.\n\n414\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.300\nBut I might wanna take things like /var\nand move it off to a separate hard drive,\n\n415\n00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.630\nor /home and\nmove it to another hard drive.\n\n416\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.490\nAnd the thinking there is again,\nI might want to limit the size of\n\n417\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.450\nthe user's home directory so\nI move them off somewhere else, or\n\n418\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.400\nI might wanna mount some of these\npartitions read-only, right?\n\n419\n00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.890\nI might want some folders read-only and\nothers read-write and if I mount them that\n\n420\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.250\nway no matter what permissions are set\non the files, it'll always be read-only.\n\n421\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.120\nSo when I come in and\nstart to mess with this.\n\n422\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.160\nI'm gonna be changing that behavior and\nchanging those mount points.\n\n423\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.270\nSo what I'm gonna do is, down here I'm\ngonna hit this New Partition Table button,\n\n424\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.470\nand now it's gonna let come through and\nstart to define things.\n\n425\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.280\nAnd it's telling me, I've selected\nan entire device to partition.\n\n426\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.080\nIf I proceed with creating it, then all\ncurrent partitions will be removed.\n\n427\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.310\nWell, I didn't have any partitions.\n\n428\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.990\nSo I don't really care.\n\n429\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.405\nBut if you have ones that were in there\nalready you would want to choose the empty\n\n430\n00:19:44.405 --> 00:19:45.296\nspace to work with.\n\n431\n00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:47.020\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose Continue.\n\n432\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.620\nAnd now see what it's done?\n\n433\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.380\nIt's identifying that I have free space.\n\n434\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.430\nSo I've got some free space.\n\n435\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.040\nAnd I cold choose to\njust install right there.\n\n436\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.583\nAnd it would auto partition that out.\n\n437\n00:19:56.583 --> 00:20:00.220\nAnd it would be the same as if I had\nchosen the easy install a moment ago.\n\n438\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.700\nOr now I can hit the plus sign and\nI can start to add in partitions.\n\n439\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.530\nWhen I add a partition it's asking\njust a couple of basic questions here\n\n440\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.920\nthat are centered around what\nit is that I'm trying to do.\n\n441\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.880\nSo the size of the partition,\nwhether it's primary or logical.\n\n442\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.780\nRemember, the hard drive can\nhave four primary partitions.\n\n443\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.150\nAnd then,\nif I want more partitions than that,\n\n444\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.560\nI need to create a logical\none to nest the other ones.\n\n445\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.750\nThat's if we're doing the older\nstyle disk formats, the MBR.\n\n446\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.380\nIf we're doing the newer style, where it\ndoes the GPT, the GUID Partition Table,\n\n447\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.690\nyou can actually have tons of primaries.\n\n448\n00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.550\nSo you may be able to leave it there.\n\n449\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.590\nWe usually don't create all\nthat many partitions anyway, so\n\n450\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.090\nwe're likely fine here.\n\n451\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.890\nWe choose where it's gonna start and\nthen how far it's gonna run out.\n\n452\n00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.745\nSo this is 36 gigs,\nthat's gonna be my whole drive.\n\n453\n00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:50.785\nAfter that I choose how\nI want to format it.\n\n454\n00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:52.145\nThis one is saying Ext 4 and\n\n455\n00:20:52.145 --> 00:20:54.985\nif I drop that down I'll see\nI've got lots of choices.\n\n456\n00:20:54.985 --> 00:20:59.017\nI can do Ext 4 which is pretty\nstandard in the Linux world so\n\n457\n00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:01.417\nmost people are going to go Ext 4.\n\n458\n00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:05.382\nBut there are some other file systems that\nare on the horizon that a lot of people\n\n459\n00:21:05.382 --> 00:21:06.595\nare starting to adopt.\n\n460\n00:21:06.595 --> 00:21:08.130\nSo let me run through some of these.\n\n461\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.600\nYou usually don't want to do this Ext2 or\n3, those are the older versions.\n\n462\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.610\nIf you can do the Ext 4 you should,\nthat's what you usually I and\n\n463\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.780\nwhat my laptop is using right now.\n\n464\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Dom why do they continue\nto support the Ext2 and\n\n465\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.820\n3 if 4 is basically the standards?\n\n466\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's backwards compatibility, and\nyou might bring in removable media and\n\n467\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.720\nplug it in and it's Ext2 or you might\nhave older systems on the network So\n\n468\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.030\nyou need to be able to move\nthis disk back and forth,\n\n469\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.020\nif I`m dual booting with another operating\nsystem that doesn't support Ext4,\n\n470\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.556\nthose are all reasons why I might have it.\n\n471\n00:21:34.556 --> 00:21:37.970\nAnd sometimes you have software that just\nexpects a file system to behave a certain\n\n472\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.200\nway, it might be expecting Ext2.\n\n473\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.490\nSo that can certainly happen.\n\n474\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:47.260\nBTRFS, or the better FS is what a lot\nof people, it actually stands for\n\n475\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.610\nthe retrieve file system.\n\n476\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:55.590\nBut BTRFS actually integrates\nall the features of LVM\n\n477\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.510\nwith the features of the XT4.\n\n478\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.020\nAnd so it's like a LVM built into it.\n\n479\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.480\nAnd BTRFS is really the way of the future.\n\n480\n00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.337\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That when I do this\n\n481\n00:22:03.337 --> 00:22:06.550\nshow three years from now, we`ll just use\nBTRFS out of hand, it will be the default.\n\n482\n00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.927\n&gt;&gt; It would be at the top of the list,\nyeah.\n\n483\n00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:09.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But right now,\n\n484\n00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:11.503\na lot of production systems\nare staying away from it,\n\n485\n00:22:11.503 --> 00:22:13.120\njust to make sure it shapes up.\n\n486\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.780\nYou don`t want your file system to\nscrew up because then you lose data.\n\n487\n00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.920\nSo we want to be careful there.\n\n488\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.890\nXFS is actually the new default for\nRed Hat.\n\n489\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.543\nSo when you do Red Hat installs\nthey default to XFS now so\n\n490\n00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:26.510\nthat's another option that's there.\n\n491\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.360\nFAT 16, FAT 32,\nthose are Windows file systems.\n\n492\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.520\nYou don't want to use those but\nyou actually can.\n\n493\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.620\nYou can install Linux on\na FAT 32 file system but\n\n494\n00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.060\nthe one I wanted to point out was\nthis guy right here swap area.\n\n495\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.590\nThat if I'm gonna add a swap area,\nI can do that.\n\n496\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.390\nAnd I can specify how much I want\nthat to be, and I don't need a ton.\n\n497\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.080\nJust a little bit.\n\n498\n00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.130\nA little buffer so\nthat I've got it available.\n\n499\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.160\nI might create one that\nis two gigs in size.\n\n500\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.140\nSo I'm gonna come up here and\njust change this to 2000 megabytes, right?\n\n501\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.901\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting about the swap.\n\n502\n00:22:54.901 --> 00:22:59.307\nAs I've watched Linux progress through\nthe years, and I've been involved with it,\n\n503\n00:22:59.307 --> 00:23:01.952\nSwap was super important\nbecause RAM was limited.\n\n504\n00:23:01.952 --> 00:23:04.352\nAnd then all of a sudden new machines\ncame out and you can add more RAM.\n\n505\n00:23:04.352 --> 00:23:05.703\nAnd you put the RAM in and you're like,\n\n506\n00:23:05.703 --> 00:23:08.064\ngreat I don't even need a swap space\nanymore because I've got more RAM.\n\n507\n00:23:08.064 --> 00:23:10.310\nAnd then the operating\nsystem starts to bloat and\n\n508\n00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.155\nnow you're saying well now I\nneed a swap space again, and\n\n509\n00:23:13.155 --> 00:23:15.810\nit's just this cyclical thing\nthat it keeps returning.\n\n510\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.718\nAnd now we've got SSDs so\nit's a whole lot faster so\n\n511\n00:23:18.718 --> 00:23:22.180\nmaybe I do want swap because it's on SSD,\nit's super fast.\n\n512\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.310\n&gt;&gt; SSD really changed the game here.\n\n513\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.050\nThere's two options on the screen\nI don't care about because of SSD.\n\n514\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.240\nIs this gonna be at the beginning\nof the empty space or\n\n515\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.560\nat the end of the empty space?\n\n516\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.070\nOn a spinning disk,\nif it was at the beginning of the disk,\n\n517\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.290\nthere's a smaller ring and\nit's technically spinning slower.\n\n518\n00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.290\nAnd on the outer ring,\n\n519\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:42.180\nit's technically spinning faster,\nas far as what the head can read.\n\n520\n00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.780\nAnd so we would normally want to take\nour swap and stick it at the end.\n\n521\n00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.324\nThat way it could get faster access.\n\n522\n00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:47.634\nThe disk is always gonna be slow, but\n\n523\n00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:49.298\nat least it would be\nfaster on that outer ring.\n\n524\n00:23:49.298 --> 00:23:52.660\nOr the head could move out tp\nthat area a little bit quicker,\n\n525\n00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.620\ncuz it's just popping right out.\n\n526\n00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.602\nSo we cared about that.\n\n527\n00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:57.983\nBut with SSD it really\ndoesn't matter where it is.\n\n528\n00:23:57.983 --> 00:24:00.040\nSo now I usually just\nstick it at the beginning.\n\n529\n00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.850\nBut you'll see a lot of people\nthat recommend putting it\n\n530\n00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.920\nat the end because of\nthe old spinning disk days.\n\n531\n00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.620\nObviously mine at the beginning.\n\n532\n00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.480\nSo when I create that\nnow I'll see /dev/vda1.\n\n533\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.090\nAnd it is just a hair\nunder two gigs in size.\n\n534\n00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.590\nAnd there's that swap partition.\n\n535\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.420\nNow I still need at least a partition for\nmy root, and so I'll come in and\n\n536\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.750\ncontinue to add more.\n\n537\n00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.850\nI'll choose that free space,\nand I'll hit plus.\n\n538\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.630\nAnd I need to add at least\none partition for root.\n\n539\n00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.120\nSo I'm going to come in here and do that.\n\n540\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.210\nI'm going to make a little bit smaller,\nmaybe I'll do six gigs for this one.\n\n541\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.630\nBecause root is gonna be holding my host\noperating system, and my boot files, and\n\n542\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.530\nother things.\n\n543\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.260\nBut I might not be sticking anything\nelse too terribly special in there.\n\n544\n00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.140\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and create that.\n\n545\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.510\nAnd who knows,\nI might even want to mount it read-only.\n\n546\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.540\nI probably don't.\n\n547\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.222\nBut there are other things that we might.\n\n548\n00:24:47.222 --> 00:24:50.780\nTechnically /usr could\nbe mounted read-only so\n\n549\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.520\nthat users can't mess with\nthe programs that go in there.\n\n550\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.510\nYou can do that.\n\n551\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.820\nA lot of people will mount\nboot as a separate partition.\n\n552\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.450\nAnd that, again, is because of the boot\nfiles, but also if you encrypt your hard\n\n553\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:06.130\ndrive, it's pretty hard to boot your\nsystem if the boot files are encrypted.\n\n554\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.440\nAnd so\nthey'll mount boot as a separate thing.\n\n555\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.720\nAnd boot doesn't need a lot of space,\n\n556\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.170\nI might do just 2 gigs to\nhold the files for that.\n\n557\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.370\nWhich probably way more than I need\nbecause the bootloader is so small.\n\n558\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.800\nBut I can come in and choose to\nmount that and I'll choose /boot.\n\n559\n00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.410\nAnd now I do that because I might\nchoose to not encrypt /boot so\n\n560\n00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.210\nthat my system will boot up.\n\n561\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:27.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that it can turn on.\n\n562\n00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.520\nAnd then when it turns on it can prompt me\nfor the encryption key, I put in the key\n\n563\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.790\nand it’s able to decrypt the root folder\nor /home or /var or the other guys right.\n\n564\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.170\nSo we continue adding on like this.\n\n565\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.220\nI'm going to just keep adding,\nI'll go ahead and split off /home and\n\n566\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.770\ngive it the rest of the space for\nmy users.\n\n567\n00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:45.720\nSo /home.\n\n568\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.590\nBut you can even see here on\nthe screen where it's got all these\n\n569\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.200\nsuggested things that I might want\nto mount on a separate partition.\n\n570\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.516\nOptional software services /user/ local.\n\n571\n00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:58.574\nThat's the one that will a lot times\nget mounted read only or /user,\n\n572\n00:25:58.574 --> 00:26:00.025\nthat's why they show up.\n\n573\n00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:04.230\n/temp, I might want to purge every so\noften and so I might split it off to\n\n574\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.620\na separate partition so I can just format\nit, which is faster than deleting.\n\n575\n00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.760\nSo that's another option,\nbut I will do /home here.\n\n576\n00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.140\nNow, you're probably asking yourself,\nwell,\n\n577\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.840\nDon, do I need to do these partitions?\n\n578\n00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.320\nThe short answer is most people don't.\n\n579\n00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.580\nMost people just need slash,\nand that's it.\n\n580\n00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.050\nYou use the automatic option and\nthat'll do it.\n\n581\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.820\nBut, if you have special needs, which I\nhave kind of been detailing as we go,\n\n582\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.330\neach one of these becomes\nappropriate in a certain scenario.\n\n583\n00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.381\nSo, it's really based on your use\ncase scenario whether you need to do\n\n584\n00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:33.529\npartitioning like this.\n\n585\n00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:38.357\nAnd some distros will automatically set\nthese partitions up for you like this but\n\n586\n00:26:38.357 --> 00:26:41.405\na lot of them just do a single slash and\nthat's it.\n\n587\n00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:43.505\nThat's the partition you get and\nit lays it out.\n\n588\n00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:46.510\nBut each one of these mount points\nwill show up to me as a folder.\n\n589\n00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.125\n/ will be my root.\n\n590\n00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.495\nAnd when I'm in the root I'll\nsee I have a 6 gig hard drive.\n\n591\n00:26:50.495 --> 00:26:53.515\nBut if I change directory in the boot\nI'll say I have a 2 gig hard drive or\n\n592\n00:26:53.515 --> 00:26:56.785\nif I go into /home I'll say\nI have a 26 gig hard drive.\n\n593\n00:26:56.785 --> 00:26:59.850\nSo it's all going to vary\nbased on what folder I'm in.\n\n594\n00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.126\nThe amount of storage I see and\nwhat's available to me.\n\n595\n00:27:03.126 --> 00:27:06.160\nBut once we've got that set up,\nit's got it all laid out right here.\n\n596\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.210\nI can see my disk I've got the appropriate\namount of space, or at least\n\n597\n00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.232\nI'm hoping I do because it's hard to\nchange after the fact if I get it wrong.\n\n598\n00:27:12.232 --> 00:27:14.451\n&gt;&gt; Don now hits back, and\ndoes the easy install.\n\n599\n00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:15.756\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] That\n\n600\n00:27:15.756 --> 00:27:19.230\nwould certainly be the safe route,\nbut I'm going to hit install now.\n\n601\n00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.650\nAnd that's gonna kick off that installer.\n\n602\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.470\nIt's gonna warn me that it is\nrepartitioning the hard drive.\n\n603\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:28.260\nSo this is the last chance I have if there\nwas data on disk that I wanted to save.\n\n604\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.920\nCuz otherwise as I hit continue,\nit's gonna write that and\n\n605\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.660\nnow everything on the disk is gone.\n\n606\n00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.260\nAnd it's gonna relay out that partition\ntable the way that we've got it set and\n\n607\n00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.730\nit's gonna start\nthe installation of Ubuntu.\n\n608\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.260\nNow there's a few last little questions.\n\n609\n00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.120\nI know I'm running low on time,\nbut let me get through this.\n\n610\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.990\nWe'll get it so that the install\nstarts and then we'll take-\n\n611\n00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.000\n&gt;&gt; Perfect stopping spot, yeah.\n\n612\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.020\n&gt;&gt; And in part three we'll\nsee the install finish.\n\n613\n00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.600\nBut it's gonna ask me for my time zone.\n\n614\n00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.010\nSo just where I am, and you can pick,\nit doesn't have to be precise,\n\n615\n00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.360\njust get it in the right time zone\nis really all that's important.\n\n616\n00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.930\nAnd so I'll pick New York and\nContinue forward.\n\n617\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.040\nIt's gonna ask me for\nmy keyboard layout, yet\n\n618\n00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.380\nanother chance to pick an alternative\nkeyboard layout if I've got one.\n\n619\n00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.340\nI'll stick with English today.\n\n620\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.160\nAnd then the default user.\n\n621\n00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.150\nIt's gonna create a user account for\nme to use.\n\n622\n00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.040\nThis is really important cuz we don't\nwanna log in as root if we can avoid it.\n\n623\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.820\nSo I'm gonna have it create one for me.\n\n624\n00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.660\nNow, it's gonna create a suggested\nname for my computer and\n\n625\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.370\nit's kind of dynamically generating it.\n\n626\n00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:23.670\nI don't like it so I'm going to give it a\nnew one and I'll say that this is going to\n\n627\n00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.620\nbe, Don Laptop VM, or\nsomething like that give it a name.\n\n628\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.030\nYou pick a username, this is the Unix\nusername that your account will go by.\n\n629\n00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.040\nIf you don't like this we can\nalways change it after the fact,\n\n630\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.540\nit's easy enough to change a username, but\nyour home directory will have this name.\n\n631\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.320\nSlash home, slash whatever you\nput in the username field.\n\n632\n00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.463\nThat's a little bit harder to change your\nhome directory because of permissions.\n\n633\n00:28:43.463 --> 00:28:46.100\nSo try and get it right [LAUGH].\n\n634\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.080\nWe'll punch in our password.\n\n635\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.630\nI'm not putting a very strong one in, so\nit's telling me mine is a little bit weak.\n\n636\n00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.550\nAnd then whether I want to do auto login,\nor require the password.\n\n637\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.170\nWe usually wanna require a password, but\n\n638\n00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.430\nyou can do automatic login if it's a home\ncomputer and you don't wanna mess with it.\n\n639\n00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.190\nYou do still have a password,\nit's just automatically logging in.\n\n640\n00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.490\nAnd then here's the encrypt my home\nfolder option I mentioned earlier.\n\n641\n00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.450\nYou can do that.\n\n642\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.750\nIt's decent but it's not as good\nas encrypting entire hard drives.\n\n643\n00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.530\nEncrypting the hard drive\nis a better option,\n\n644\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.930\nbut one scenario where\nyou might like this.\n\n645\n00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.910\nIf you have more than one user account,\nand\n\n646\n00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.490\nthe users are sharing the same computer.\n\n647\n00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.120\nAnd you encrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n648\n00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.870\nEach user has to be able to\ndecrypt the entire hard drive, so\n\n649\n00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.560\nthe other users would have\naccess to your data potentially.\n\n650\n00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.620\nSo, if I wanted to keep my data private\neven from other users of my own computer,\n\n651\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.240\nI might choose to encrypt the home folder.\n\n652\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.740\nAnd you can actually do both where\nyou encrypt the hard drive and\n\n653\n00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.210\nyour home folder which will\nbe the best for both worlds.\n\n654\n00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.710\nBut if it's a dedicated machine just for\n\n655\n00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.549\nyou, encrypting the hard\ndrive is the best option.\n\n656\n00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.340\nAfter that it's got everything it needs\nand is gonna start the installer.\n\n657\n00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.990\nNow the installer may take,\nit could take ten or\n\n658\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.390\n15 minutes, it could take two minutes.\n\n659\n00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.600\nIt depends on the speed of your system,\n\n660\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.710\nmine will go pretty quick thanks to SSD\nbut I'm not gonna wait on it because\n\n661\n00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.570\nwe're running out of time but in real\nlife it could take 10 or 15 minutes.\n\n662\n00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.600\nThat little orange bar is going to scroll\nacross the bottom of your screen and\n\n663\n00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.100\nwhen it's done It's gonna reboot.\n\n664\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.420\nAnd then we're almost done with\ngetting Ubuntu to installed.\n\n665\n00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.230\nWe'll have a few little odds and ends\nto take care of as soon as that's done.\n\n666\n00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, thanks for\ngetting us this far.\n\n667\n00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.090\nAnd if you've never seen a boot\nto a Linux installation before or\n\n668\n00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.180\nmaybe even a Linux installation before,\nDon, I think you did a great job of\n\n669\n00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.020\ndemonstrating how that works and\nexplaining each of the options\n\n670\n00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.230\nthat you're going to stumble across\nas you work your way through it.\n\n671\n00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.120\nSo if you've never see that before,\nnow you know what those do.\n\n672\n00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.180\nAnd if you have done it before, maybe you\ndon't know what each one of those done.\n\n673\n00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.240\nNow if you feel so strong, you're like,\nI didn't know that did that,\n\n674\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.750\nyou can go back and\nrepartition or something.\n\n675\n00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.010\nNow being said like Don has eluded to,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n676\n00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.570\nDefinitely join us back for\npart three to finish installation, but\n\n677\n00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.040\nthat is leading us to signing off.\n\n678\n00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.246\nFor ITPRO TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n679\n00:30:47.246 --> 00:30:47.975\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n680\n00:30:47.975 --> 00:30:49.902\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n681\n00:30:49.902 -->

00:00:16.080\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.013\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.013 --> 00:00:22.821\nin today's episode it is more with our\nbecoming a Linux system administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:26.676\nAnd joining us back from the studio to\ncontinue our conversation on getting Linux\n\n10\n00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:29.963\nand Unbuntu or Unbuntu and Linux\nshould I get that right installed and\n\n11\n00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.929\ncompleting our installation\nour good friend Mr. Don Pesat.\n\n12\n00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.486\nDon we're glad to have you back yet\nagain, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:39.421\n&gt;&gt; Hey it is going great and hopefully\nwe'll wrap up our install this episode so\n\n14\n00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:41.829\nwe left off with\nthe installer running right.\n\n15\n00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:42.354\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n16\n00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:43.318\n&gt;&gt; The little orange bar\ncrawling across the screen.\n\n17\n00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:45.920\nWhich is representative of my career.\n\n18\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slowly crawling across the years.\n\n19\n00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.720\n[LAUGH] So anyhow at this point\nthe install has finished.\n\n20\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.750\nAnd when it's done,\nyou just get a little screen telling you.\n\n21\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.270\nAs a second it's on my computer right now.\n\n22\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.980\nTelling us that the install has completed.\n\n23\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.546\nAnd now we're ready to restart,\nwhich is kind of that moment of truth.\n\n24\n00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:03.725\nRight, that,\nwe've booted off the install media.\n\n25\n00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.985\nAnd the install media booted with\na very vanilla set of drivers and\n\n26\n00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.059\nwe know that worked.\n\n27\n00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:13.340\nBut after we do that first reboot, now\nit's going to reload the full driver set.\n\n28\n00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.910\nAnd so, just because everything has\ngone great right up until this point\n\n29\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.840\nDoesn't mean things are going\nto keep going great.\n\n30\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.110\nSo we've got to be prepared to start\nwatching for any kind of errors or\n\n31\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.120\nother things to happen.\n\n32\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.210\nThat's why it pauses on that screen\ninstead of just automatically\n\n33\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.200\nrebooting for us.\n\n34\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.170\nSo that if we walked away, and got some\ncoffee, took a break, started another\n\n35\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.670\nshow, then you can come back and\nnow you can watch that reboot process.\n\n36\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.970\nThat's where we're going to be kicking off\ntoday and actually seeing what happens.\n\n37\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.860\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\nwell without further ado,\n\n38\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.917\nI say we jump right back\ninto where we left off.\n\n39\n00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:44.252\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I'm gonna take\nthe plunge, I'm gonna click Restart Now.\n\n40\n00:01:44.252 --> 00:01:45.123\n&gt;&gt; Do it, do it.\n\n41\n00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you were using a USB key,\n\n42\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.142\nthis is the point where you would\npop it out of the computer so\n\n43\n00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.780\nthat you wouldn't boot\nback up off of it again.\n\n44\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.970\nIf you used a boot menu like pressing\nF12 to get to it or something like that,\n\n45\n00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.530\nthen usually you don't have to\nworry about taking the key out,\n\n46\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.240\nbecause it's just gonna reboot and\ncome back up and you'll be fine.\n\n47\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120\nSo my system is rebooting.\n\n48\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.450\nAnd what we hope to see is something\nmore than just a black screen.\n\n49\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.960\nSo what we should be seeing, here shortly,\nis the Ubuntu logo should pop up.\n\n50\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.720\nAnd we may see some text scrolling by.\n\n51\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.840\nA lot of times this stuff gets hidden.\n\n52\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.390\nIt hides the text scrolling by so\nthat we don't see it.\n\n53\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.150\nYou just see the Ubuntu logo and\nit's nice and pretty.\n\n54\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.180\nBut if it doesn't happen,\nif it sees like even one error,\n\n55\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.640\nit'll get rid of that logo and\nactually start showing the text.\n\n56\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.316\nSo when you start seeing that scroll\nby that's an indicator that something\n\n57\n00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:32.856\nmight have gone wrong.\n\n58\n00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:37.930\nUnfortunately, while it shows you\nthe text it doesn't actually slow down or\n\n59\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.954\npause for you.\n\n60\n00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:40.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It shoots right on by.\n\n61\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.530\nSo, that's where we talked\nabout this in earlier episodes.\n\n62\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.100\nWe'll need to get the system online so\nthat we can look at D message.\n\n63\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.310\nWe can look at the logs and\nwe can see what happened.\n\n64\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.750\nNow my system is still sitting\nhere in a black screen.\n\n65\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.467\nAnd I haven't seen the little logo.\nSo,\n\n66\n00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:55.281\nthis is probably indicating that\nit hasn't actually restarted.\n\n67\n00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:58.158\nI clicked the restart button and\nit closed the graphics and\n\n68\n00:02:58.158 --> 00:03:01.447\nright now it's reaching out to\nthe motherboard and saying, hey,\n\n69\n00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.510\nlet me trigger ACPI and\ntell it to reboot the system.\n\n70\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.695\nNow, if it doesn't have the right\ndriver for the motherboard or\n\n71\n00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:08.759\nif can't communicate like that\nthen it might not restart and\n\n72\n00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.065\nthat's maybe what's going on here.\n\n73\n00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.949\n&gt;&gt; That's probably an issue\nbecause it's a virtual machine and\n\n74\n00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.222\nnot actually reaching the motherboard.\n\n75\n00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:17.165\n&gt;&gt; More than likely, in my scenario, but\nit could happen on a real machine as well.\n\n76\n00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:17.688\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n77\n00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:20.700\n&gt;&gt; And if that's the case, the solution\nhere is actually not very elegant.\n\n78\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Don,\nwhen you say not very elegant,\n\n79\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.760\nwe basically are talking about brut\nforcing the power off with your\n\n80\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.150\nfinger on the button until it shuts off,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we don't like to do that cuz\nyou can get disk errors, improper rights,\n\n82\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.790\nthey don't finish.\n\n83\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.990\nBut in this part of the install,\nit's done, it's already installed.\n\n84\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.670\nIt's supposed to be shutting down.\n\n85\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.620\nAll the rights should be committed.\n\n86\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.790\nSo it's pretty safe to do.\n\n87\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.260\nSo I'm just gonna hit that\npower button and there we go.\n\n88\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.330\nSo it's gonna start a restart.\n\n89\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.020\nIt's gonna come up, the Ubuntu\nlogo will flash by, really fast.\n\n90\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.670\nBut hopefully, this is what we see.\n\n91\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.373\nAnd I've got my little speaker turned off.\n\n92\n00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:53.491\nYou'd normally hear a, dungdung, noise.\n\n93\n00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:53.997\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n94\n00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:56.544\n&gt;&gt; Ubuntu makes every time it books up.\n\n95\n00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:59.942\nSo, once it's up and running,\nhere I am, I'm at my login screen,\n\n96\n00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:02.940\nwith the user account that was\ncreated during the install.\n\n97\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.320\nSo I should be able to login,\nassuming I remember my password.\n\n98\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.420\nAnd we could get logged in, and now,\nwe're up and we're running Ubuntu.\n\n99\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.860\nNow, you might say to yourself,\nwe're done.\n\n100\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.600\nBut you're not technically done.\n\n101\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.486\nThere's still some odds and ends we've got\nto get taken care of here to make sure.\n\n102\n00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:22.595\nBut, we are past the major-\n&gt;&gt; We are done-ish.\n\n103\n00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:26.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, we've made our major decisions,\n\n104\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.050\ndispartitioning, and\nall of that are done and put in place.\n\n105\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.480\nAnd in fact, if I start doing things\nlike jumping into a terminal and\n\n106\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.202\nbrowsing around and looking for things,\n\n107\n00:04:37.202 --> 00:04:40.873\nthen I should see that that's\nall already being filed.\n\n108\n00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:42.718\nWhoops, a little too big there.\n\n109\n00:04:42.718 --> 00:04:43.321\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n110\n00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:46.614\nthat petitioning scheme should\nalready in place for me.\n\n111\n00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:51.006\nIf I do something like a df-h and\nlook, I can kind of look in here and\n\n112\n00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:55.680\nsee where I've got my root partition\nis showing up as 5.4 gigs.\n\n113\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.050\nMy home partition is 24 gigs,\nmy boot partition is 1.9 gigs.\n\n114\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.820\nRight, there's all those partitions\nwe created during the install.\n\n115\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.760\nAnd they're all setup for us.\n\n116\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.400\nAs a user I don't even\nhave to think about them,\n\n117\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.870\nI just browse around on the hard drive and\n\n118\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.650\nI don't realize that I'm moving between\npartitions when I do something like that.\n\n119\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.140\nBut it's happening in the background.\n\n120\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.510\nThe swap partition is already activated,\nand it's up and running.\n\n121\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.200\nMy software appears to be working.\n\n122\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.133\nNow, I'm still in a 4x3 resolution,\nso I might need to go in and\n\n123\n00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:26.945\ncustomize my desktop.\n\n124\n00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:31.000\nYou've got your settings icon right here\nin your launchpad, where you can go into\n\n125\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.013\nyour displays and modify the resolution to\nset it to whatever it is that you want.\n\n126\n00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:39.741\nSo maybe, I want to jump it all the way\nup to 1920 by 1080 or 1280 by 720.\n\n127\n00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:42.810\nWe can start to experiment around with\nthese things to get it configured\n\n128\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.048\nproperly for our computer.\n\n129\n00:05:44.048 --> 00:05:49.760\nAnd when we do that you may find, where\nsome of the settings work just great.\n\n130\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.100\nAnd everything is now perfect and happy.\n\n131\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.190\nOther times, where a setting doesn't work\nquite right, and you've got to tweak\n\n132\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.410\nit some more and adjust it to get things\nkind of configured the way you want.\n\n133\n00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.280\nBut as far as the core OS,\nwe are actually done with that part, but\n\n134\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.300\nthere's always a little bit of\nadministrative tasks that I want to do as\n\n135\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.080\nsoon as an install is done.\n\n136\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.010\nOne of those,\n\n137\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.970\nis I want to check to see if there were\nany errors in hardware detection, right,\n\n138\n00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.750\nwhich In our managing hardware episode,\nI covered how to do that.\n\n139\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.520\nSo, if you didn't watch the episode\nthough, just a quick summary.\n\n140\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.050\nDrop to a terminal and\nuse the D message command.\n\n141\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.160\nD message will show you\neverything that happened in boot.\n\n142\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.810\nAll the stuff that was hidden from us,\n\n143\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.970\nduring the boot will be tucked\naway inside of D message output.\n\n144\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.247\nSo if we run d-m-e-s-g, D message, that\nshows everything that happened, and a lot\n\n145\n00:06:36.247 --> 00:06:40.692\nof this is good stuff, good information\nthat, it found my network card.\n\n146\n00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:44.778\nIt did whatever, but\nif we pipe that into grep,\n\n147\n00:06:44.778 --> 00:06:49.300\nwe can always do a search for\nthe word error.\n\n148\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.217\nAnd just see if any errors popped up,\nand I did get one.\n\n149\n00:06:51.217 --> 00:06:57.949\nIn EXT4 error there on VDA5 was remounted,\nwhich is not actually a big deal here.\n\n150\n00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.662\nIt's just saying, one of the options was,\nif there is an error,\n\n151\n00:07:01.662 --> 00:07:03.970\nwe're going to remount it as read only.\n\n152\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.460\nSo, that's actually fine,\nwe expect to see that one.\n\n153\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.559\nThere weren't any other errors.\nSo it looks good.\n\n154\n00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:12.047\nIf all my hardware was detected, if I hear\nsound, then I'm in good shape, otherwise,\n\n155\n00:07:12.047 --> 00:07:14.778\nI need to go back to that\nmanaging hardware episode and\n\n156\n00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:16.550\nsee how all that works from there.\n\n157\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Man, that's a whole lot\neasier than just going, why am\n\n158\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.610\nI not getting any network connectivity or\nwhere's the sound in this stinking thing?\n\n159\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.800\nWhy isn't that working?\n\n160\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah looking at those logs\nthat will save you a ton of time.\n\n161\n00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:29.005\nThe other thing that we\nneed to do are updates.\n\n162\n00:07:29.005 --> 00:07:31.929\nNow, I chose not to download\nupdates during my install and\n\n163\n00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.550\nthere are two reasons I do that.\n\n164\n00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.821\nOne, is I was in a hurry.\n\n165\n00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:38.704\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And two,\n\n166\n00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:42.904\nis the updates that it downloads are just\nthe updates for this particular version,\n\n167\n00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:47.150\nand it won't update certain things like\nthe kernel that's shipped with it.\n\n168\n00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.793\nNow, if I'm running Ubuntu 16.04,\nthere's been 16.04.1 and .2, since then,\n\n169\n00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:54.451\nand by the time you watch this show,\nmaybe even a .3 and\n\n170\n00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:57.814\nthere are kernel updates from time\nto time, and those won't happen.\n\n171\n00:07:57.814 --> 00:08:02.860\nSo I need to go in and\ndo a full set of updates on this system.\n\n172\n00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.002\nNow you might be tempted to use\nthe updates that are right here as part\n\n173\n00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:07.004\nof the software app.\n\n174\n00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:11.070\nIf I go into a Ubuntu software or\nthere's actually another update.\n\n175\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.400\nIf you just do a search for update, you'll\nfind software and updates right there or\n\n176\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.740\nthe software updater,\nall of those are good utilities.\n\n177\n00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.600\nAll of those will update your operating\nsystem, but they won't update the kernel.\n\n178\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.350\nThey won't update to\nthe next version of Ubuntu.\n\n179\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.560\nAt least not by default.\n\n180\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.333\nIf you go into software and\nupdates, you can come in here and\n\n181\n00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.210\nyou can change the way they behave.\n\n182\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.050\nAnd what you'll see when you look under\nupdates is where it is looking for\n\n183\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.350\nupdates, daily, it's performing the\nupdates and it's getting information from\n\n184\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.200\nwhenever there is a new longer\nterm support version of Ubuntu.\n\n185\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.542\nYou may wanna change that to say any\nnew version and since 16.04 came out.\n\n186\n00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:51.574\nThere's been 16.10, 17.04, and\nthen around the corner is 17.10.\n\n187\n00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:54.830\nWell, all of those are not\nlong term support.\n\n188\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.790\nSo if I want to transition to\none of those other versions,\n\n189\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.950\nI could change this box and\nnow it would update me.\n\n190\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.313\nToday, it would update me to 17.04.\n\n191\n00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:05.687\nI would do a huge change\nfrom just a minor update.\n\n192\n00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:09.469\nBut if I want to stay right here with\nthis version, what I typically do,\n\n193\n00:09:09.469 --> 00:09:12.240\nis don't use the software\nutilities like that.\n\n194\n00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.680\nI use the good old trusty command button.\n\n195\n00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.310\nWhen you drop to the terminal,\n\n196\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.120\nyou can do a handful of different\nupdates right from here.\n\n197\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.450\nAnd not have to worry about jumping\ninto the wrong instance or whatever.\n\n198\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.730\nThat everything's gonna happen\nthe way that we intend it to be.\n\n199\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.790\nIn the Ubuntu world,\n\n200\n00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.400\nwe use a utility called apt,\nto be able to manage our updates.\n\n201\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.250\nSo you can do sudo,\nwhich actually I should test and\n\n202\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.510\nmake sure that I'm allowed to use sudo,\nright?\n\n203\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.730\nThat when I go and try and\nuse the sudo command,\n\n204\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.830\nif it didn't make me an administrator,\nI might not be able to use it, right?\n\n205\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.190\nSo I'm just doing a quick test here\nto make sure that I can use sudo.\n\n206\n00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.570\nIf I couldn't, well go back and watch the\nepisode we did on the root user account\n\n207\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.600\nand we show how to get sudo set up and\nyou a chance to see that there.\n\n208\n00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.990\nBut I can, so\nI'm going to say sudo apt update.\n\n209\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.140\nOkay, now the sudo apt update command is\nreally interesting because it doesn't\n\n210\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.990\nactually update your system.\n\n211\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.760\nYour system maintains\na database of updates and\n\n212\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.600\nwhen you run pseudo-apt updates,\nit's just updating that database,\n\n213\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.880\nit's telling you what\nupgrades are available.\n\n214\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.190\nSo when I run that, it's gonna reach out\nand it's gonna find any updates that\n\n215\n00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:23.180\nare out there and it looks like there's\n220 packages have been updated but\n\n216\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.560\nit didn't actually update them.\n\n217\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:32.000\nI need to turn around to run sudo app\nupgrade to actually apply those updates.\n\n218\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.059\nAnd now, it's gonna reach out and\n\n219\n00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:38.835\nit's gonna download those 220 upgraded\npackages and get them put in place.\n\n220\n00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.899\nAll right,\nnow 220 sounds like a really big number.\n\n221\n00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:43.359\nThis is gonna take a long time.\n\n222\n00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:44.569\nBut you'll see that,\n\n223\n00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:48.970\nit's actually gonna go through pretty\nfast cuz a lot of these packages are 50k.\n\n224\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In size or a 100k,\n\n225\n00:10:50.505 --> 00:10:52.230\nthey're really small.\n\n226\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.990\nSome are big though like if\nthere’s a Libre Office update,\n\n227\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.130\nthat one can take a while.\n\n228\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.230\nSo it may take a bit of time, you’ve got\na little counter down here in the corner,\n\n229\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.090\nits telling me I’m 16% of the way through.\n\n230\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.799\nSo it’s moving along and\nit’s giving me an estimate.\n\n231\n00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:05.877\nThe estimate is kind of a joke.\n\n232\n00:11:05.877 --> 00:11:08.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we pretend it’s telling me I got\n\n233\n00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:09.920\nabout two minutes.\n\n234\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.430\nNow while we're waiting on that,\nafter these updates are done,\n\n235\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.780\nthere may be packages that we\nhad that we don't need any more.\n\n236\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.290\nSo, I'm gonna turn around and\nrun another command after this,\n\n237\n00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.820\nwhich is going to be sudo apt,\nauto remove.\n\n238\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.210\nAnd what auto remove does is it looks for\npackages we don't need anymore and\n\n239\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.950\nit removes them.\n\n240\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.780\nAnd that's a good idea cuz you don't\nwant these packages laying around.\n\n241\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.570\nAs you start installing third party\nsoftware, you'll see this happen more and\n\n242\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.500\nmore and more.\n\n243\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.220\nEspecially if you're removing software.\n\n244\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.970\nSo auto remove is really handy to kind of\nclean up the mess that gets left behind.\n\n245\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.130\nAnd I can't remember but I think it\nactually suggests that you do that.\n\n246\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.580\n&gt;&gt; I think it does every\ntime you run sudo.\n\n247\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.150\nSometimes well, at least in my experience,\nI will actually see.\n\n248\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.030\nHey, you have these packages that are kind\nof laying around you're not using anymore.\n\n249\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.500\nYou might wanna use that remove\nfunctionality to get rid of them.\n\n250\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's not about disk space anymore.\n\n251\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.210\nIt used to be.\nYou didn't want stuff eating up disk space\n\n252\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.070\nbut now it's more about security, right?\n\n253\n00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.420\nAny extra software that's not being used\nis really increasing your attack surface\n\n254\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.020\nfor no real benefit.\n\n255\n00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.990\nSo, we want to make sure that\nwe get rid of that stuff and\n\n256\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.050\nnot have it laying around,\nso we're gonna do that.\n\n257\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.350\nThe other thing is,\n\n258\n00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.810\nas a part of this update,\nthere may have been a kernel update.\n\n259\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.210\nAll the updates I'm doing right now,\n\n260\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.930\nI can apply without rebooting,\nit's not going to ask me to reboot.\n\n261\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.330\nBut if I want to update the kernel,\nthat's gonna require a reboot.\n\n262\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.520\nAnd so as a result it's actually\nnot going to upgrade my kernel.\n\n263\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.568\nWhen you run sudo apt upgrade,\nit's upgrading all the support files,\n\n264\n00:12:32.568 --> 00:12:36.622\nall the software and\napplications, but not the kernel.\n\n265\n00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:41.092\nAnd if I want to do an actual kernel\nupgrade I need to run another command,\n\n266\n00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:45.273\nwhich is sudu apped dist dash upgrade\nlike distribution upgrade and\n\n267\n00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:48.890\nthat's the one that's\ngonna upgrade the kernel.\n\n268\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.270\nNow when you do that,\nyou need to reboot when it's done.\n\n269\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.570\nSo if this is a mission critical server,\nthat's something we've got to schedule.\n\n270\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.120\nIf it's a workstation, it's a no brainer.\n\n271\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.180\nI do it just right here out of hand.\n\n272\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.310\nAnd doing it right now,\n\n273\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.370\nwhile the system is not really\nbeing used is the perfect time.\n\n274\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.514\nCuz you're not gonna inconvenience\nanybody by upgrading that.\n\n275\n00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:07.428\nAnd then it's done and you can move on and\n\n276\n00:13:07.428 --> 00:13:10.471\nstart installing all of your\nother software and utilities, and\n\n277\n00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:14.152\nstart configuring things, and\nget rid of this God-awful Unity interface.\n\n278\n00:13:14.152 --> 00:13:15.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n279\n00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:19.409\nall the things that you do to make\nUbuntu the operating system that it is.\n\n280\n00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:22.920\nAll right, so that's gonna finish.\n\n281\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.110\nI talked about auto-remove,\n\n282\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.460\nwhich I'm gonna do,\nthe dist upgrade which I'm going to do.\n\n283\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.510\nAfter that, we can start to\nrely on the software updaters.\n\n284\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.590\nThey do a really good job.\n\n285\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.790\nYou can set it to check every day and\nit'll do that update.\n\n286\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.040\nOne thing to be aware of is that you\ncan only be running one software\n\n287\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.610\nupdate program at a time.\n\n288\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.280\nSo while I'm running this one,\nit's locked to the updates database.\n\n289\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.280\nIf I were to go and launch one of these\nother update programs, they would actually\n\n290\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.090\nfreeze while the command line\nprogram was running or vice versa.\n\n291\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.970\nIf I left one of these open and I went to\nthe command line the command line will\n\n292\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.220\nfreeze waiting on the first one to close.\n\n293\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.110\nSo you can only run one at a time.\n\n294\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.310\nBut once I'm done with the command\nline one, if I have this software and\n\n295\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.950\nupdate utility set to do daily updates\nit'll still do the daily updates.\n\n296\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.370\nAnd that's typically\nsomething that you want.\n\n297\n00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.210\nYou don`t necessarily want to jump\nto the next version of Ubuntu,\n\n298\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.162\nyou want to wait until you`re ready.\n\n299\n00:14:13.162 --> 00:14:16.729\nIf you`re running a long term support\nversion, you can stay on it for five years\n\n300\n00:14:16.729 --> 00:14:20.511\nand it will still get security updates and\npatches and everything that you want there\n\n301\n00:14:20.511 --> 00:14:24.046\nand you don`t really have to deviate from\nthat unless you just really want to.\n\n302\n00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:27.775\n&gt;&gt; Helpful tip, it`s just me, I though\nabout this and we kind of moved along.\n\n303\n00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:30.384\nWhen you do sudo,,\nif you wanted to check and\n\n304\n00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:34.298\nsee what you have the ability to sudo\nto do, you just sudo dash L, and\n\n305\n00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:37.616\nit will list the things that\nyou have the ability to sudo.\n\n306\n00:14:37.616 --> 00:14:41.030\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point, I just tested\nto see if I could use sudo, and\n\n307\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.438\nit is possible with sudo that you've only\nbeen given access to certain commands, so\n\n308\n00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:47.480\nsudo dash L, would turn that up.\n\n309\n00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.360\nIn my case, doing the update, you have\nto be an administrator to do that.\n\n310\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.956\nIf you're not, you just can't do it..\n\n311\n00:14:53.956 --> 00:14:55.719\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's usually pretty.\n\n312\n00:14:55.719 --> 00:14:58.897\nWell in Ubuntu, it's pre-saved.\n\n313\n00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:01.275\n&gt;&gt; I think my account says like,\nwhat you have is the ability to sudo all.\n\n314\n00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:02.593\nThis is all commands.\n\n315\n00:15:02.593 --> 00:15:04.425\nSo I'm like okay, this is good.\n\n316\n00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:05.369\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n317\n00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:08.221\nnow the first set of percentages I was\nseeing was it actually downloading\n\n318\n00:15:08.221 --> 00:15:09.920\nthe packages and now, it's installing.\n\n319\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.120\nAnd installing happens way faster\ncuz it's really just copying files.\n\n320\n00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.090\nSo this one's limited merely by\nthe speed of your hard drive.\n\n321\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.880\nSo it's gonna churn along and\napply those updates.\n\n322\n00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.970\nNow while we're waiting on that,\nwe could be checking our log files for\n\n323\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.920\nother things that might have\nhappened during the boot.\n\n324\n00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.500\nRemember from the other episodes where\nwe troubleshot some of this stuff.\n\n325\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.470\nThat you've got your journal CTL, and\n\n326\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:36.230\nother logs files available that show you\nwhat's kinda going on in your system.\n\n327\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.100\nSo we can take a look at journal CTL and\nyou can do a dash b to see boot messages\n\n328\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.980\nwhich is just like d message and we can\nstart filtering and looking for hardware.\n\n329\n00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.100\nHardware usually boils down to a couple of\nthings that you'll have issues with and\n\n330\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.780\nit's typically your sound card,\nyour network adapter and\n\n331\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.250\nyour video card, right?\n\n332\n00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.583\nIf the video card wasn`t detected\ncorrectly, that can be a problem.\n\n333\n00:15:56.583 --> 00:16:00.473\nYou can spot a lot of that\nby doing the lspci command,\n\n334\n00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:04.719\nwhich you`ll want to run as root user,\nso I'll do sudo,\n\n335\n00:16:04.719 --> 00:16:09.990\nlspci to get that list of the pci\ndevices that were detected.\n\n336\n00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.250\nAnd then you can use the ls mod\ncommand to look at the driver modules\n\n337\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.110\nthat were loaded.\n\n338\n00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.580\nSo I'm hoping that when I look in here,\n\n339\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.470\nI'll spot that my device\nwere detected properly and\n\n340\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.070\nls mod should show me that the drivers\nwere loaded and I can spot that.\n\n341\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.690\nSo again, we covered all that\nin the hardware episode,\n\n342\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.930\nwe've kind of already seen that.\n\n343\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.450\nBack here, these updates are almost done.\n\n344\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.170\nWe might use the magic of TV\nhere to advance this one.\n\n345\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.170\nI had a little bit to let it finish.\n\n346\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.040\nBut once it's done, we'll do that\nauto remove and disk upgrade and\n\n347\n00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.480\nat that point it will\nactually be completed.\n\n348\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.680\nSo, let's leverage the magic of\ntelevision and warp forward in time.\n\n349\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.690\nI'll be right back after that.\n\n350\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.910\nOkay, so there we go, it finally finished,\n\n351\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.520\nit just turned through\nfinishing the install.\n\n352\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.170\nAnd it actually didn't warn be about\nautoremove, which I thought it would.\n\n353\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.920\nBut we can still do it anyway, so\n\n354\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.780\nit's always better safe than\nsorry in this kind of stuff.\n\n355\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.110\nSo, I'm just gonna run sudo apt again, and\n\n356\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.490\nthis time I'm gonna do sudo\napt autoremove, like that.\n\n357\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.475\nAnd that's just gonna look for\nany packages that we didn't need,\n\n358\n00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:08.757\nit only found one, so that's not too bad.\n\n359\n00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:10.738\nWell, it's new system, I guess.\n\n360\n00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:11.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so I'll go and\n\n361\n00:17:11.794 --> 00:17:13.685\nsay yes and remove that one and\nget it out of there.\n\n362\n00:17:13.685 --> 00:17:15.004\n&gt;&gt; Like you said, we see this more with,\n\n363\n00:17:15.004 --> 00:17:17.023\nas we install more third-party software,\nright?\n\n364\n00:17:17.023 --> 00:17:19.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAbsolutely, it turns up more and more.\n\n365\n00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.007\nThe next thing I wanna do,\nis actually do the kernel upgrade and\n\n366\n00:17:23.007 --> 00:17:27.216\nI'm gonna rerun sudo apt upgrade but\nI'm gonna change it a little bit so\n\n367\n00:17:27.216 --> 00:17:29.410\nthat it's pseudo apt dist upgrade.\n\n368\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.522\nAnd that's what's gonna go in and\nactually perform that kernel upgrade, or\n\n369\n00:17:33.522 --> 00:17:35.494\nit would if there was one available.\n\n370\n00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:38.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm running 16.04.2,\n\n371\n00:17:38.581 --> 00:17:42.177\nwhich apparently has the latest kernel and\nother information.\n\n372\n00:17:42.177 --> 00:17:46.579\nIf I was running 16.04.1, this is\nwhat would move me up to that .2 and\n\n373\n00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:47.404\nget me there.\n\n374\n00:17:47.404 --> 00:17:48.550\nIn my case, hey this is great.\n\n375\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.281\n&gt;&gt; You're already there.\n\n376\n00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:50.337\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't have it.\n\n377\n00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:52.995\nYou still wanna run the command cuz that's\nhow you know you don't need it, but\n\n378\n00:17:52.995 --> 00:17:54.140\nwe're good there.\n\n379\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.800\nSo if there was an update here,\nit would apply the update.\n\n380\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.270\nIt usually goes really fast cuz your\nkernel is really small, it's a meg and\n\n381\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.320\na half in size.\n\n382\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.930\nSo it'll update really fast,\nand then you need to reboot.\n\n383\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.760\nThat's the one that requires a reboot.\n\n384\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.936\nAll of the other updates that are just\npart of the normal apt upgrade,\n\n385\n00:18:10.936 --> 00:18:15.050\nthose do not require a reboot but\ndist upgrade, does.\n\n386\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.700\nNow that's done.\n\n387\n00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.450\nI'm kind of golden, right?\n\n388\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.372\nWe got Ubuntu installed,\nmy hardware's working,\n\n389\n00:18:21.372 --> 00:18:25.756\nmy system's up to date, I'm ready to-\n&gt;&gt; Now you can get that third-party\n\n390\n00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:28.266\nsoftware in there and\nstart punching holes in your security.\n\n391\n00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:30.008\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is true,\n\n392\n00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:31.473\nand a lot of third-party\nsoftware messes with your stuff.\n\n393\n00:18:31.473 --> 00:18:35.231\nIn the default install for Ubuntu,\nit's actually very secure, very stable,\n\n394\n00:18:35.231 --> 00:18:37.764\nit's when we start manipulating it and\nchanging it.\n\n395\n00:18:37.764 --> 00:18:41.432\nMaybe I decide, I really hate Unity so\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n396\n00:18:41.432 --> 00:18:46.143\ninstall the Gnome desktop environment and\nstart messing with stuff like that and\n\n397\n00:18:46.143 --> 00:18:50.736\nnow it starts to get a little be flaky\nthat does happen, but in it's base form.\n\n398\n00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Pristine\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty good, yeah.\n\n399\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.176\nAll right, well Daniel,\nI think that's a pretty good spot for\n\n400\n00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.504\nus to wrap up installing Ubuntu.\n\n401\n00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:59.227\nWe've seen that whole process\nfrom the very beginning of\n\n402\n00:18:59.227 --> 00:19:02.347\ncreating our install media to\nperforming the installation, and\n\n403\n00:19:02.347 --> 00:19:04.627\nthen now performing\nthe post-install tasks.\n\n404\n00:19:04.627 --> 00:19:08.048\nIt's done and\nnow we get a usable computer.\n\n405\n00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:09.632\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\nwe do thank you for\n\n406\n00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:11.362\nwalking us through\nthe Ubuntu installation.\n\n407\n00:19:11.362 --> 00:19:15.473\nIt was pretty painless and now we have\na little more knowledge to be able\n\n408\n00:19:15.473 --> 00:19:18.061\nto do that task ourselves\nin real life land.\n\n409\n00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:21.088\nThat being said, and looks like\nwe're at the end of our episode.\n\n410\n00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:22.824\nWe do thank you for watching,\nwe hope you enjoyed it.\n\n411\n00:19:22.824 --> 00:19:25.421\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n412\n00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:26.395\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n413\n00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:27.869\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n414\n00:19:27.869

00:00:08.290\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.029\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.758\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:16.440\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.250\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.770\nin today's episode it's all about becoming\na system administrator inside of Linux or\n\n9\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.530\nusing Linux and\nbecoming a system administrator there.\n\n10\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.012\nJoining us in the studio again in\nthe series, our good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:31.910\nDon, we're glad to have you again and\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.990\n&gt;&gt; Things are going great.\n\n13\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.460\nI'm actually really excited about\nthis episode because I've been\n\n14\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.585\nkind of trapped in this Ubuntu world for\na while.\n\n15\n00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:38.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In\n\n16\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.720\nthis episode we get to return back to my\ncomfort zone which is the Fedora world.\n\n17\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.360\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthe Fedora operating system.\n\n18\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.580\nAnd how we can get it, build our\ninstallation media, get it installed,\n\n19\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.870\nget it updated, and actually start to\nuse Fedora as our operating system.\n\n20\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.930\nNow everybody out there has their\nLinux distribution of choice, right.\n\n21\n00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.140\nPeople find their favorite and\nthey stick with it.\n\n22\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.560\nMy personal favorite does happen to be\nFedora, so I kind of like this one.\n\n23\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.350\nSo looking forward to this episode and\nshowing you guys how to get Fedora up and\n\n24\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.310\nrunning in your environment.\n\n25\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.070\n&gt;&gt; I half expect Don to pull out a red\nfedora at some point and put it on for\n\n26\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.110\nthe entirety of the show.\n\n27\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.770\nBut, we digress.\n\n28\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.585\nI guess when it comes to installing\na new operating system or picking\n\n29\n00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:17.160\nan operating system, the first thing we\nhave to do is actually get a copy of it.\n\n30\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.582\nHow the heck do we get a copy of Fedora?\n\n31\n00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:22.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, well we can get a copy\nof Fedora right from their web page,\n\n32\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.650\nwhich is actually,\nlet me pull it up right here.\n\n33\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.557\nThe getfedora.org.\n\n34\n00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:28.895\nAnd you know-\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty helpful.\n\n35\n00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:30.408\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanna get Fedora, where do I go?\n\n36\n00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:31.583\nGetfedora.org.\n\n37\n00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:35.840\nThat .org is kind of important because\nit is a non-profit organization, right.\n\n38\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.620\nFedora is completely free.\n\n39\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.725\nAnd like many operating systems\nyou might ask yourself,\n\n40\n00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:43.970\nwell how can it be completely free?\n\n41\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.250\nHow do they make their money?\n\n42\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.010\nWe talked about Ubuntu in other episodes.\n\n43\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.440\nThat company is canonical and\n\n44\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.730\nthey make their money based on\nselling support agreements, right.\n\n45\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.115\nIn Fedora land, they don't do support.\n\n46\n00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're on your own.\n\n47\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo how do they make money?\n\n48\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.010\nAnd the reality is,\n\n49\n00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.670\nthat Fedora is actually not an independent\noperating system all by itself.\n\n50\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.242\nFedora actually starts at Red Hat.\n\n51\n00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:10.320\nRed Hat is the largest commercial\n\n52\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.130\nentity that releases a Linux\ndistribution in the world.\n\n53\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.310\nThey have a distribution called\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, or\n\n54\n00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.220\nRHEL, and companies can buy it.\n\n55\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.096\nAnd it costs, I believe it`s something\nlike $350 per server as a license.\n\n56\n00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:25.989\nAnd when you purchase that\nyou get a year of support and\n\n57\n00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.175\nyou can call them and get help and\nthat`s Red Hat, right.\n\n58\n00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:30.946\nIt`s a commercial distribution.\n\n59\n00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:33.376\nBut under the Open Source license,\n\n60\n00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:38.800\nthey have to make their source code\navailable for free, and so they do.\n\n61\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.704\nAnd so there's another organization\nout there called CentOS,\n\n62\n00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:44.250\nthe Community Enterprise Operating System.\n\n63\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.860\nAnd what they do is they take all\nthe source code that Red Hat releases and\n\n64\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.750\nthey just recompile it without the Red Hat\nlogos cuz those are copyrighted.\n\n65\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.350\nAnd then they release it as\nbasically Red Hat that's free.\n\n66\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.800\nNow Red Hat focuses on stability.\n\n67\n00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.210\nThey want to have the most stable,\nrock solid operating system possible so\n\n68\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.130\nthat businesses can use it and\nuse it reliably.\n\n69\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.350\nYou can run it on your servers.\n\n70\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.080\nWhen I spin up a Linux server,\nif I'm given a choice I use Red Hat for\n\n71\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.760\nmy Linux servers almost exclusively,\nthat's the operating system I prefer.\n\n72\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.880\nIt cost money but\nit is very very stable, all right.\n\n73\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.520\nBut on the desktop Red Hat is\na bit of a mixed bag because\n\n74\n00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.250\nby getting stability they give up being\non the latest cutting edge features.\n\n75\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.580\nThey like a feature to be out for a few\nyears before they adopt it into the OS.\n\n76\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.820\nThat means they want these features\nto be tested and tried and\n\n77\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.027\nproven true out there in the field before\nbringing it into the rank and file OS.\n\n78\n00:03:39.027 --> 00:03:44.410\nNow the way they do that,\nis through their Fedora project.\n\n79\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.450\nFedora is an extension of Red Hat.\n\n80\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.430\nIn fact, the majority of the people\nthat work on the Fedora project\n\n81\n00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.090\nare actually Red Hat employees.\n\n82\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.170\nThey draw their salary from Red Hat.\n\n83\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.150\nSo whenever there's a new feature,\nsomething exciting and fancy and\n\n84\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.830\ncutting edge that Red Hat wants to try,\nthey put it in Fedora first.\n\n85\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.860\nAnd they let it cook in Fedora for\na year or two.\n\n86\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.880\nAnd after they've seen that feature\nstabilized, they've fixed the bugs,\n\n87\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.810\nthey get everything working perfectly,\nthen they integrate it into Red Hat.\n\n88\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.580\nSo if you want a rock solid,\nstable OS you go with Red Hat,\n\n89\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.540\nbut you're not going to\nhave the latest features.\n\n90\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.160\nIf you want the latest\nfeatures you go with Fedora.\n\n91\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.240\nNow as an IT administrator we're\npretty comfortable with dealing with\n\n92\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.600\nlittle issues and getting things\nsquared away, so Fedora works great.\n\n93\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.580\nBut for a production desktop\nyou might not want that.\n\n94\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.660\nSo these are all related,\nRed Hat, CentOS, and Fedora.\n\n95\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.520\nI like Fedora because it does\ngive me the latest software, and\n\n96\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.380\nas an IT guy I need that.\n\n97\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.490\nSo I can go to the Fedora project's\nwebsite and I can download the latest and\n\n98\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.660\ngreatest distro.\n\n99\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.420\nNow they do have more than one version.\n\n100\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.140\nAs you scroll down, you'll see where\nthey've got a workstation, a server, and\n\n101\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.530\natomic, all right.\n\n102\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.170\nNow technically all three\nof these are the same OS.\n\n103\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.620\nUnder the hood,\nyou've got the same Linux kernel\n\n104\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.990\nwith the same Fedora core utilities.\n\n105\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.920\nWhere it gets different is what's\nadded on after that, right.\n\n106\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.830\nThe workstation includes a graphical\nuser interface, LibreOffice,\n\n107\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.610\nit's got the GNOME window manager.\n\n108\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.280\nAll the different things that\nwe want on a desktop, right.\n\n109\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.340\nAnd that's actually what I'm running on my\nvery laptop right now, what we're seeing,\n\n110\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.519\nI'm running Fedora Workstation.\n\n111\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.963\nOn a server though, we don't need a GUI.\n\n112\n00:05:17.963 --> 00:05:21.317\nWe don't need GNOME, we don't need\nall these desktopie type features,\n\n113\n00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:22.990\nwe don't need LibreOffice.\n\n114\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.650\nAnd so with the server install,\nit's scaled down,\n\n115\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.380\nit leaves all that software off.\n\n116\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.250\nNow I could install the server version and\nadd the graphical user interface to it,\n\n117\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.180\nand all of a sudden I'm basically\na workstation because the core OS\n\n118\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.790\nis the same.\n\n119\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.430\nThere's not a functional\ndifference between these two\n\n120\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.830\naside from the packages that\nare installed by default.\n\n121\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.495\nIt's really just\na repackage of the same OS.\n\n122\n00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:48.100\nAnd Atomic is one of the newest ones,\nand this one is scaled down even more.\n\n123\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.902\nThe operating system is insanely basic\nbecause it's got just enough to be able to\n\n124\n00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:55.230\nrun container applications.\n\n125\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.150\nSo if you hear people who are excited\nabout Docker, right, Docker,\n\n126\n00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.050\nyou can take an application and\n\n127\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.550\nyou stick it in a container and\nyou can run that container anywhere.\n\n128\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.320\nAtomic is designed to be\na host that can provide that.\n\n129\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.278\nAnd so if you look it says, Fedora Atomic\nprovides the best platform for your Linux,\n\n130\n00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:10.580\nDocker, Cubernetis, LDK applications tech.\n\n131\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's congratulations to them,\nthey have the best.\n\n132\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The best, yes,\n\n133\n00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:16.548\nas tested by their marketing team.\n\n134\n00:06:16.548 --> 00:06:18.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So who knows if the best or not, but\n\n135\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.230\nthat's what that one's available for.\n\n136\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.530\nSo most of us aren't going to want Atomic.\n\n137\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.120\nIf you're a developer, if you're doing\nwhatever, then you might want Atomic.\n\n138\n00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.440\nBut Atomic would be designed to run\non a server because it's not gonna\n\n139\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.250\ngive you a UI that you\nreally work with very well.\n\n140\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.070\nSo in this show,\nI'm gonna be using Workstation.\n\n141\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.110\nBut again,\nthe install would be the same for Server,\n\n142\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.410\nit's just gonna be less software\npackages that are installed.\n\n143\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.550\nSo when you float over Workstation, you'll\nsee that Download Now button I can hit.\n\n144\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.720\nAnd that's gonna take me\nto the download screen.\n\n145\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.710\nNow the current version of\nFedora is Fedora 25, all right.\n\n146\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.250\nAnd with Fedora 25, that's gonna give\nus the latest and greatest features.\n\n147\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.420\nAnd so it's the default\ndownload right here, okay.\n\n148\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.190\nNotice that it's a 64 bit OS, that's\nwhat it's offering for me to download.\n\n149\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.290\nAnd so I can pull it or right beneath it\nthere's a little link here that says,\n\n150\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.720\ndo I need instructions or\na different version?\n\n151\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.820\nThere are other versions\nof Fedora available.\n\n152\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.149\nAnd you kinda see that here on\nthe web page under other downloads.\n\n153\n00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:17.500\nThe 64 bit version is the default,\nbut there is a 32 bit version.\n\n154\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.870\nIf I've got a 32 bit processor and\nI try and boot off of a 64 bit installer,\n\n155\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.360\nI'll just get a black screen.\n\n156\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.424\nIt won't do it, right,\nit can't run a 64 bit instruction set.\n\n157\n00:07:26.424 --> 00:07:31.090\nBut I can run 32 bit on either 64 or\n32 bit.\n\n158\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.580\nThe thing is on a 32 bit system,\n\n159\n00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.300\nno one application can consume\nmore than 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n160\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.470\nYou can have more than four gigs of RAM,\nbut\n\n161\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.450\neach application would be\nlimited to four gigs itself.\n\n162\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.780\nAnd if you're running a database software,\n\n163\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.810\nthen it may need way more\nthan four gigs of RAM.\n\n164\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.763\nOr video editing, always, it'll take\nas much RAM as you can get it, right.\n\n165\n00:07:49.763 --> 00:07:53.287\nAnd on a 32 bit system it would be\nartificially held to this 4 gig limit\n\n166\n00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:56.723\nbecause of the address space is not\nlarge enough to go beyond 4 gigs.\n\n167\n00:07:56.723 --> 00:07:58.685\nIn 64 bit we can though.\n\n168\n00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:00.646\nAnd so in most of our distributions or\n\n169\n00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:04.780\nmost of our installs on most of our\ncomputers today, we want 64 bit.\n\n170\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.030\nIn fact if you bought a computer\nin the last seven years probably,\n\n171\n00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.920\nit should be 64 bit capable.\n\n172\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.270\nIf you're not sure you can always drop\nto a command line and do an LSCPU and\n\n173\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.900\nit will tell you, or if you're in Windows\nyou can run utilities like CPUID.\n\n174\n00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.620\nAnd they'll tell you what CPU you have,\nand you should see that it\n\n175\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.200\nhas 64 bits imported/g/\n&gt;&gt; Now Don,\n\n176\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.150\nif I have a little laptop laying around,\nmaybe it's 10 years old or whatever,\n\n177\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.970\nsitting in a closet, and\nI think I wanna play with Fedora,\n\n178\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.850\nwould that work on this or\nis there a hardware compatibility list?\n\n179\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.440\nOr specs that I have to meet for\nFedora to be my OS of choice?\n\n180\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.660\n&gt;&gt; The other will work.\n\n181\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They do have,\n\n182\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.860\nif you poke around on the page you'll see\nwhere they've got a lot of information\n\n183\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.530\nhere on the installation guide and\ncommon bugs and\n\n184\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.320\nthings that layout what\nyou're expected to have.\n\n185\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.330\nBut the reality is that Fedora will\nrun on a ton of different hardware,\n\n186\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.040\neven on older hardware.\n\n187\n00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.508\nIt may not run as well,\n\n188\n00:08:54.508 --> 00:08:57.130\nthere's other distros out there\na little more tuned to it.\n\n189\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.820\nBut usually it's just your window\nmanager that affects performance.\n\n190\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.100\nAnd with fedora, it's gonna\ninstall the GNONME Window Manager,\n\n191\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.470\nwhich is not the best for performance.\n\n192\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.310\nSo you might wanna change to XFCE or\none of the other ones.\n\n193\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.970\nAnd it'll run great.\n\n194\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.256\nBut yeah, you'll see all that.\n\n195\n00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.180\nIf I were to do this\nneed instructions link,\n\n196\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.770\nsee how it just takes me right down\nhere to the things that I'm identifying.\n\n197\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.750\nBut it tells you how to obtain the media\nand it gives the other information here to\n\n198\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.456\nfind out whether or not your system\nmeets the specs and what you need.\n\n199\n00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:25.220\nAll right, now if I want to install this,\n\n200\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.610\nI need to come up with an idea of\nhow I'm gonna be doing the install.\n\n201\n00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.070\nAnd there's a few different\nways we can do it.\n\n202\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.170\nBut normally,\nit's gonna boil down to two things.\n\n203\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.390\nEither installing from a CD-ROM or\ninstalling from a USB key, okay?\n\n204\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.560\nNow most of what we're gonna see\non here hints at being run from\n\n205\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.970\na CD-ROM because that's how things were\ndone for years and years and years, right?\n\n206\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.317\nBut I don't have a CD drive in my laptop.\n\n207\n00:09:46.317 --> 00:09:47.258\nDaniel do you have one in yours?\n\n208\n00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:48.280\n&gt;&gt; That's a negative sir.\n\n209\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.115\n&gt;&gt; All right, so most people don't have\nCD drives in their computers anymore,\n\n210\n00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:54.390\nso installing from a CD is pretty rare.\n\n211\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.310\ninstead, nowadays,\nwe usually install from a USB key.\n\n212\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.904\nUSB keys are a lot faster and\nyou have them, right?\n\n213\n00:10:01.904 --> 00:10:04.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think I've\ngot like 40 of them.\n\n214\n00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.810\n&gt;&gt; They're a dime a dozen\nat the supermarket.\n\n215\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.580\nYou can buy them at the counter\nat a gas station if you want.\n\n216\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.330\nSo these are really common,\nand they work everywhere.\n\n217\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.211\nVersus a CD, which is becoming more and\nmore archaic.\n\n218\n00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:15.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's more and\n\n219\n00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:18.360\nmore rare to find\na system with a CD drive.\n\n220\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.140\nEven servers a lot of times\nwill leave those CD drives out.\n\n221\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.357\nSo if you go to do this download,\n\n222\n00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:32.243\nit's gonna have us download\na 64-bit ISO image.\n\n223\n00:10:32.243 --> 00:10:36.230\nAnd an ISO image is really designed\nto be written to a CD, right?\n\n224\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.800\nYou can drop the command line and burn it\nor if you download it it in the GUI you\n\n225\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.610\njust right click and choose to burn it to\na CD, and off you go, if you've got a CD.\n\n226\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.480\nBut most of us are gonna\nwanna make the USB key.\n\n227\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.135\nSo if we wanna make the USB key,\ntheir's two different ways to go about it.\n\n228\n00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:56.700\nThere's one way that works\non every UNIX based system.\n\n229\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.230\nSo that's Linux, Mac OS,\nFreeBSD, any of those guys.\n\n230\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.309\nThere's one way that works with that.\n\n231\n00:11:02.309 --> 00:11:04.712\n&gt;&gt; Verbal abuse, yell at the computer.\n\n232\n00:11:04.712 --> 00:11:05.931\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] If you scream louder.\n\n233\n00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:09.070\nThere is another way though for Windows.\n\n234\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.550\nCuz Windows doesn't have\none of these utilities.\n\n235\n00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.930\nThere's a utility called DD,\nthe old disk duplication utility.\n\n236\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.090\nAnd DD is present on\nevery Unix based system.\n\n237\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.460\nSo you can use DD to make the USB key.\n\n238\n00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.210\nBut if you're on Windows,\nyou don't have DD.\n\n239\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.380\nWell fortunately the guys at Fedora have\nthought about that and if you scroll down,\n\n240\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.520\nyou'll see where they've got like\nthe Fedora free media program.\n\n241\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.410\nWhere they tell you a little bit\nabout how you can obtain media from\n\n242\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.650\nother companies and give it away for free.\n\n243\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.450\nYou can go that way but they actually\ndo have a little software package\n\n244\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.050\nthat you can download which I'm\nnot seeing here for some reason.\n\n245\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.560\nBut they have a little utility that's\n\n246\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.410\ncalled the Fedora Installation\nMedia Writer that you can run.\n\n247\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.150\nIt's probably because I'm\nnot on a Windows machine.\n\n248\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.240\nBut you can go and run that and it will\nactually create the USB key for you, or\n\n249\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240\nyou can use other software.\n\n250\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.850\nNow let me throw out a word of caution.\n\n251\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.540\nOn the Internet you'll find\na lot of instructions that\n\n252\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.030\ntell you to use a utility\ncalled UNetbootin.\n\n253\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.730\nAnd I used UNetbootin for\nyears, it was great.\n\n254\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.160\nBut ever since most systems\nhave moved over to EFI BIOS,\n\n255\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.840\nUNetbootin has not been writing\npartitions properly on USB keys.\n\n256\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.470\nSo if you use that software,\n\n257\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.730\nthe odds of it creating a functional\nUSB key are pretty low.\n\n258\n00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.310\nAnd for some reason,\nit hasn't been updated.\n\n259\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.780\nI'm not sure the whole back story on that,\nbut basically don't use it,\n\n260\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.340\ndon't use UNetbootin.\n\n261\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.110\nThe DD utility always works.\n\n262\n00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.970\nIt worked in the past, it works now.\n\n263\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.720\nIt's just command line.\n\n264\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.660\nAnd people don't like that.\n\n265\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.920\nUNetbootin had a GUI, people liked it.\n\n266\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.360\nBut in the Windows world since we don't\nhave that, if you're on a Windows machine,\n\n267\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.998\nwhat you need to do is download the image.\n\n268\n00:12:37.998 --> 00:12:41.920\nAll right, so download that Fedora\n25 image or if you're really\n\n269\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.200\nexcited you can scroll down a little bit,\nyou'll see there is a prerelease for\n\n270\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.430\nFedora 26,\nyou can download the beta of that.\n\n271\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.420\nI don't recommend that on anything\nother than a test machine.\n\n272\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.100\nIt's actually a little\nflakier than most betas.\n\n273\n00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.780\nUsually a Fedora beta is pretty stable,\nthis one is not.\n\n274\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.300\nThere is a couple of big changes\ncoming in for Fedora 26.\n\n275\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.610\nBut you can download that one if you want.\n\n276\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.680\nBut you're gonna download that ISO.\n\n277\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.890\nAnd then in the Windows world,\n\n278\n00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.960\nthere's a utility from the BSD\norganizations called Rawrite32.\n\n279\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.070\nSo here's Rawrite on the NetBSD page.\n\n280\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.690\nAnd if you go here, you can download.\n\n281\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.540\nIt's a graphical user interface.\n\n282\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.880\nYou pick your ISO image that you wanna\nburn, you pick your USB key, and\n\n283\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.370\nthen you hit Write to Disk.\n\n284\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.250\nAnd it writes it.\n\n285\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.610\nAnd Rawrite does a great job of preserving\nthe partition structure that's on\n\n286\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.700\nthe USB key.\n\n287\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.280\nAnd that's really important for\nEFI systems.\n\n288\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.346\nIf you've got an older system,\na legacy just traditional BIOS system,\n\n289\n00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:34.219\nUNetbootin and those guys would work fine.\n\n290\n00:13:34.219 --> 00:13:38.029\nBut if you've got EFI, you would\nreally wanna use Rawrite on Windows or\n\n291\n00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:39.310\nDD on everything else.\n\n292\n00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.210\nNow I've already got Linux on my system,\nso\n\n293\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.220\nI'm gonna use the DD utility\nto get this installed.\n\n294\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.630\nSo what I need to do is I need\nto download the distribution,\n\n295\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.550\nwhich I've downloaded before\nthe show to save some time.\n\n296\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.510\nIt's not that big, it's at 1.3 gigs,\nso it'd be a pretty quick download.\n\n297\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:58.210\nBut you're gonna download that and then,\nwe're gonna write it to the USB key.\n\n298\n00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.700\nNow understand that whatever is on\nthis USB key is gonna get erased.\n\n299\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.420\nSo we wanna make sure there's\nno critical data on there.\n\n300\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.550\nI usually use ones that I get at\n\n301\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.260\ntrade shows\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n302\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.510\n&gt;&gt; Say I wanna erase those anyway,\nwho can trust them?\n\n303\n00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.520\nBut you can get USB keys really cheap.\n\n304\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.530\nNotice the ISO image is only 1.3 gigs, so\n\n305\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.670\nI only need a USB key\nthat's 2 gigs in size.\n\n306\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.990\nWell, you can't even buy those anymore.\n\n307\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.700\nSo 4 gigs is pretty standard.\n\n308\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.330\nThis was the smallest one I\ncould find in the office.\n\n309\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.780\nIt is 16 gigs in size.\n\n310\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.870\nSo, more than enough room to\nbe able to hold this image.\n\n311\n00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.480\nNow, before I plug it in though,\nbecause I'm going to erase it, and\n\n312\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.360\nbecause I'm gonna\noverwrite it with the ISO,\n\n313\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.170\nI'm gonna need to know the UNIX file\nname that gets assigned to this, right?\n\n314\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.915\nRemember, any hardware\nthat we add to our system,\n\n315\n00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:41.520\nthe udev service will assign it a name.\n\n316\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.170\nAnd I need to know the name.\n\n317\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.340\nIf I get the name wrong,\nI could erase the wrong hard drive and\n\n318\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.405\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad.\n\n319\n00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:48.890\n&gt;&gt; It would make me cry.\n\n320\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.560\n&gt;&gt; Important safety tip.\n\n321\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.273\n&gt;&gt; So we need to know the name.\n\n322\n00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:55.568\nSo I'm gonna download that distro and\nthen let me get this out of the way.\n\n323\n00:14:55.568 --> 00:14:59.672\nAnd then I'm gonna drop to a terminal,\nand what I recommend you do,\n\n324\n00:14:59.672 --> 00:15:02.336\nis follow the hardware\nlogs on your system so\n\n325\n00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:07.320\nthat you can see when this is plugged in,\nyou can see exactly what name it gets.\n\n326\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.990\nAnd you can use DE message for it but\n\n327\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.170\non most monitoring systems\nwe can use journalctl.\n\n328\n00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.460\nOn any system, DE system, you can do this.\n\n329\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:20.080\nSo if you’re on a Ubuntu or Mint or\nRed Hat, you can use Journalctl.\n\n330\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.570\nOr tailing dmesg is another one,\nif you look at the last ten lines of\n\n331\n00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.950\nthe dmesg log,\nyou'll see anything that gets added.\n\n332\n00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:31.660\nI'm gonna run Journalctl -f, and that\nsays show me the last lines of journal,\n\n333\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.430\nof my system d journal, and\nthen keep following it.\n\n334\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.810\nSo as new lines appear,\ndisplay them on the screen.\n\n335\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.708\nOkay so I'm gonna run it, and here it is.\n\n336\n00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:42.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna plug in my USB\nkey while that's up on the screen.\n\n337\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.678\nI'm gonna try to if I\ncan find the slot here.\n\n338\n00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.508\nSo I'm gonna plug it in and I start to\nsee messages coming across the screen.\n\n339\n00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:50.945\nAnd this is important because right here,\n\n340\n00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:53.864\nI can see the name that was\nassigned to that USB key.\n\n341\n00:15:53.864 --> 00:15:58.861\nAnd mine is SDB Right, I've actually\ngot two hard drives in my system,\n\n342\n00:15:58.861 --> 00:16:02.000\none is NVMe0 and the other one is sda.\n\n343\n00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.280\nSo this one is now sdb that’s being added.\n\n344\n00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.220\nIf I didn't know that,\n\n345\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.180\nI might pick the wrong name and\nthen format the wrong drive.\n\n346\n00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.280\nSo I know this one is called sdb,\nthat’s what I needed to see.\n\n347\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.000\nSo I can stop journalctl, and now,\nI'm ready to install that ISO image.\n\n348\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.450\nNow, let me get to my folder where\nI downloaded that before the show.\n\n349\n00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.350\nAnd I'll take a look at it now.\n\n350\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.850\nI've downloaded several different\nFedora images over time.\n\n351\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.510\nAnd you'll see where I pulled\nthe Fedora Server and Fedora Workstation.\n\n352\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.560\nThe workstation is the one that I want.\n\n353\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.890\nIf you have multiple ISOs laying\naround and you're never unsure,\n\n354\n00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.857\ntake a look at what’s in the filename.\n\n355\n00:16:40.857 --> 00:16:47.210\nSee how mine says, -x86_64, that’s how\nI know that’s it’s the 64-bit version.\n\n356\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.610\nIf it says, x86, but not with the 64,\n\n357\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.040\nthen that's gonna indicate\nthat it's 32-bit version.\n\n358\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.800\nSo be aware that you might have\ngotten the two different ones.\n\n359\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.000\nAnd I mentioned that Fedora Media Writer,\nI've downloaded a copy of that,\n\n360\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000\nthat's from Windows.\n\n361\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.020\nOn the Windows world, if you just do\na Google search for Fedora Media Writer,\n\n362\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.980\nyou'll find that and you can download\nit and it'll help build that ISO or\n\n363\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.330\ninstall it on USB key as well.\n\n364\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.790\nSo but I'm gonna be working\nwith this Fedora Workstation.\n\n365\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.418\nAnd it's Fedora Workstation Live.\n\n366\n00:17:16.418 --> 00:17:18.696\nSo that let's me know\nthat it is a live CD.\n\n367\n00:17:18.696 --> 00:17:22.930\nI could actually run the Fedora operating\nsystem from that USB key if I wanted\n\n368\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.330\nwithout installing it.\n\n369\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.270\nSo if you ever wanna just try Fedora and\n\n370\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.780\nsee if you like it,\nthat's a great low risk way to do it.\n\n371\n00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.800\nYou get in there and\n\n372\n00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.330\nyou kind of experiment around with it\nbefore installing it to your hard drive.\n\n373\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.590\n&gt;&gt; They can also be really great for using\nas a recovery disk for things as well.\n\n374\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There's\n\n375\n00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:40.130\na lot of functionality\nwith those live disks.\n\n376\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe you messed around\nwith your hardware drivers, and now,\n\n377\n00:17:42.387 --> 00:17:43.275\nyour video is not working.\n\n378\n00:17:43.275 --> 00:17:47.076\nYou can't do anything,\nyou could boot off that USB key.\n\n379\n00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:49.128\nSo it is nice to keep it handy, yeah.\n\n380\n00:17:49.128 --> 00:17:53.200\nAll right, so now that I've got it,\nI know where the file is.\n\n381\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.730\nI'm ready to write it to my key.\n\n382\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.340\nNow, to do that, the command is,\nit's actually a little bit of a long one.\n\n383\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.470\nSo let me resize my window so\nwe'll be able to see it.\n\n384\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.140\nWhat we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna call it DD.\n\n385\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.780\nNow, DD is disk duplicator.\n\n386\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.150\nIt's gonna erase the disk.\n\n387\n00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.260\nYou have to be an administrator to run dd.\n\n388\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.444\nSo I'm gonna sudo-\n&gt;&gt; I thought you meant disk destroyer.\n\n389\n00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:13.515\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's very true.\n\n390\n00:18:13.515 --> 00:18:15.475\n&gt;&gt; Because it can do that.\n\n391\n00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:17.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm gonna run dd, and\n\n392\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.496\nI'm gonna say that the input file equals,\nand\n\n393\n00:18:20.496 --> 00:18:23.720\nI'm gonna tell it what\nthe input file is gonna be.\n\n394\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.522\nIn my case, it is going to be\nthe Fedora Workstation, and\n\n395\n00:18:27.522 --> 00:18:33.008\nI'm using Tab autocomplete to save me from\nall the typos that I'll make [INAUDIBLE]\n\n396\n00:18:33.008 --> 00:18:33.872\n&gt;&gt; You are so fast.\n\n397\n00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:37.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, I need to tell it the output\n\n398\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.790\nfile, and this is where it gets a little\nweird cuz I'm not outputting to a file.\n\n399\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.730\nI'm gonna output to /dev/sdb, right.\n\n400\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.360\nI'm writing to that USB drive.\n\n401\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.930\nAnd it's really important that I just say,\nsdb.\n\n402\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.170\nThere might be partitions on there,\nsdb1, sdb2.\n\n403\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.690\nI need to rewrite\nthe entire partition table.\n\n404\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.925\nAnd the partition table\nis a part of that ISO.\n\n405\n00:18:57.925 --> 00:18:59.876\nAnd so\nif I just point it to the disk itself,\n\n406\n00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:02.040\nit will destroy any\npartition that's there.\n\n407\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.350\nThey'll all go away and\n\n408\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.250\nthen be replaced with the partitions\nthat are present on the ISO.\n\n409\n00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.580\nIn the olden days, when we had classic or\n\n410\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.830\nlegacy BIOS, there was only one partition\non the install media, so you didn't care.\n\n411\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:18.200\nBut with EFI, EFI requires a simple,\n\n412\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.960\nsmall, FAT32 partition to actually\nstore the EFI boot files, and\n\n413\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.280\nso we gotta have at least two partitions\nto get the installer to work.\n\n414\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.710\nOtherwise, the whole thing breaks down.\n\n415\n00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.003\nSo that's why it's so\nimportant that we just say, /dev/sdb,\n\n416\n00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:36.246\nwithout a number, or also be aware,\nI'm doing sdb, yours might be sdc or sda.\n\n417\n00:19:36.246 --> 00:19:42.561\nIt might be hda, or hdb, and or NVMe,\nlike mine, where I have NGMe drive.\n\n418\n00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:46.808\nSo make sure you get that naming right for\nwhere you're gonna be writing this to.\n\n419\n00:19:46.808 --> 00:19:47.940\nSo that's where I'm gonna write it to.\n\n420\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.173\nNow, if I just press Enter, it's going\nto create that installation media,\n\n421\n00:19:51.173 --> 00:19:52.538\nit is going to work, I promise.\n\n422\n00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:53.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n423\n00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:58.790\nDD doesn't really give us\nany on screen feedback.\n\n424\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.069\nIt just sits there.\n\n425\n00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:03.201\nAnd depending on the speed of your USB\ndrive, this could take 15 minutes, and\n\n426\n00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.090\nit basically looks like\nyour system is frozen.\n\n427\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Locked up.\n\n428\n00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:06.400\n&gt;&gt; And you get nothing.\n\n429\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.360\nSo on newer versions of DD,\n\n430\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.136\nyou can add to this and\nyou can say, status.\n\n431\n00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:20.520\nStatus, apparently,\ntyping is the hardest part, =progress.\n\n432\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.450\nAnd that tells us to give us on-screen\noutput of what's going on, okay.\n\n433\n00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.551\nIf you have an older version of DD,\nit might not have that.\n\n434\n00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:30.758\nI think the version in\nMac OS doesn't have it.\n\n435\n00:20:30.758 --> 00:20:31.577\nWell, in Mac OS,\n\n436\n00:20:31.577 --> 00:20:34.600\nwe could use the Fedora Media Writer\nif we wanted to go that route.\n\n437\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.010\nOr we could use DD and\npipe the file through the pv command.\n\n438\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.173\npv is a utility that's been\na part of Unix for a long time.\n\n439\n00:20:44.173 --> 00:20:47.340\nIt's probably on your system already,\nbut you might need to install it.\n\n440\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.120\nAnd you can pv the ISO image, and\n\n441\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.700\nthen pipe that into the dd command,\nand pv will show the progress.\n\n442\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.420\nAnd that's how we used to do it, but\n\n443\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.940\nthe newer versions of DD have\nit where they'll show you.\n\n444\n00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.515\nSo when I run that, it's gonna start,\nand ooh, I got an error.\n\n445\n00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:07.928\n/dev/sdb, I did spell it right, didn't I?\n\n446\n00:21:07.928 --> 00:21:08.519\n&gt;&gt; sdb.\n\n447\n00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI got an error writing that output file.\n\n448\n00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.520\nSo /dev/sdb,\nit wasn't too happy with that.\n\n449\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.616\nThis can be caused by\na few different things.\n\n450\n00:21:17.616 --> 00:21:19.130\nUsually, it's caused by not sudoing and\n\n451\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.190\nnot giving it\nthe administrative privileges.\n\n452\n00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.480\nBut it could also be that there are some\npartition on there that's protected or\n\n453\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.150\neven in use, right?\n\n454\n00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.170\nWhen I popped in that USB key,\nit's possible that the operating system is\n\n455\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.960\nalready dove in there and\nstarted messing with it.\n\n456\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.260\nSo I might need to unmount that disk.\n\n457\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.715\nNow, if I run the mount command,\nit'll show me things that are mounted.\n\n458\n00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:42.333\nAnd you can look in here, there`s kind of\na lot of stuff, let me just grab that.\n\n459\n00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:42.925\n&gt;&gt; Grab that out.\n\n460\n00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:45.374\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sdb.\n\n461\n00:21:45.374 --> 00:21:46.156\nI don`t see sdb, it`s not mounted.\n\n462\n00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:48.442\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So it`s not mounted,\n\n463\n00:21:48.442 --> 00:21:50.301\nI bet if I rerun this, it just works.\n\n464\n00:21:50.301 --> 00:21:51.628\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:21:51.628 --> 00:21:52.724\n&gt;&gt; That does happen.\n\n466\n00:21:52.724 --> 00:21:54.755\nBut a lot of times you`ll see,\nand there it goes.\n\n467\n00:21:54.755 --> 00:21:56.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where if the disk was mounted and\n\n468\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.992\nit just had a hard time unmounting it,\nthen you might get an error like that.\n\n469\n00:21:59.992 --> 00:22:03.370\nSo I just double checked if\nit was mounted, mine wasn't.\n\n470\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.180\nBut if it was, you could use\nthe umount command, or unmount, sorry.\n\n471\n00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.650\nSo I would say, sudo unmount/dev/sdb,\nand that would unmount it.\n\n472\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.330\nOr it usually be a partition inside of it.\n\n473\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.760\nSo the /dev/sdb1 or /sdb2, or so on.\n\n474\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.570\nAnd that'll unmount it, get it out\nof there, and once it’s free, then,\n\n475\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.240\nyou can run the command and do it again.\n\n476\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.260\nIn my case,\nit would probably just slow to unmount,\n\n477\n00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.750\nand that’s why when I ran it\nthe second time, it nailed it.\n\n478\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.940\nNow, it’s churning along, and\nthanks to that status command,\n\n479\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.780\nI can see the progress.\n\n480\n00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.760\nThe ISO image is 1.3 gigs.\n\n481\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.116\nSo I’m gonna be comping\nabout 1300 megabytes.\n\n482\n00:22:38.116 --> 00:22:39.888\nAnd so I can sit here and watch.\n\n483\n00:22:39.888 --> 00:22:43.938\nIt doesn't really give you a percentage\nbecause DD doesn't actually know how big\n\n484\n00:22:43.938 --> 00:22:44.680\nthe file is.\n\n485\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.490\nIt's just churning along and\nwhen it ends, it ends, right?\n\n486\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.140\nSo at this rate, it looks like it's\nprobably gonna take another two or\n\n487\n00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.070\nthree minutes.\n\n488\n00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.870\nAnd we don't need to sit around and\n\n489\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:59.020\nwatch this, but when it's done,\nit's just gonna stop.\n\n490\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.630\nIt's not like you're gonna see fireworks\nor anything, [LAUGH] it just stops.\n\n491\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.710\nAnd at that point, you now have\nthe installation media you needed.\n\n492\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:10.840\nSo I can go and boot any computer off of\nthat USB key and start to install Fedora.\n\n493\n00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.550\nSo that makes life super easy,\nand I can hang onto that.\n\n494\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.275\nThis DD process I just showed you works\non Mac OS, and on Linux, and Unix BSD,\n\n495\n00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:20.674\nworks on any of those.\n\n496\n00:23:20.674 --> 00:23:23.145\nWindows is the only one that\nwould be different, and\n\n497\n00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:26.260\nyou can use that Fedora Media Writer or\nthe Rawrite32 utility.\n\n498\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.620\nThose are both ones that work reliably for\ncreating an installation media.\n\n499\n00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.642\nAll right, but that being said,\nthis is probably a good spot for\n\n500\n00:23:32.642 --> 00:23:33.549\nus to just kinda break here.\n\n501\n00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:38.182\nAnd what we'll do is we'll wrap this\nepisode up and come back with a part two.\n\n502\n00:23:38.182 --> 00:23:43.070\nAnd in part two, we'll take that USB key\nand actually perform our installation.\n\n503\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.955\nSo in this episode,\nwe got a chance to see what Fedora is and\n\n504\n00:23:46.955 --> 00:23:49.320\nkinda how it came about\nfrom the Red Hat world.\n\n505\n00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.633\nAnd we saw creating that\ninstallation media.\n\n506\n00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:54.090\nIn the next episode,\nwe'll get a chance to install it.\n\n507\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.271\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don,\nit's been a lot of fun.\n\n508\n00:23:55.271 --> 00:23:57.670\nI'm enjoying the process so far.\n\n509\n00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.220\nAnd walking us through this step by step,\nmaking sure we explain each process,\n\n510\n00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.230\nwhy we're doing it, what the options\nare and what they do can be very,\n\n511\n00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.960\nvery helpful, especially for\nthe uninitiated.\n\n512\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.596\nIf you've never worked with Linux before,\nyou think, you know what,\n\n513\n00:24:10.596 --> 00:24:12.487\nFedora just seems like my cup of tea.\n\n514\n00:24:12.487 --> 00:24:14.390\nThis is very, very helpful for you.\n\n515\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.130\nAnd we do thank you for\nshowing us how to do this stuff.\n\n516\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.120\nWell, you said it, we're gonna not sit\nhere and watch this thing crank away.\n\n517\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.840\nWe'll save that for the next episode.\n\n518\n00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.390\nWe do thank you good folks for watching.\n\n519\n00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.187\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nbeen your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n520\n00:24:26.187 --> 00:24:27.382\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n521\n00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:29.575\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:10.478\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:11.212\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:15.994\ngreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:20.517\nl'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing in our series\n\n7\n00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:24.199\nabout becoming a Linux Systems\nadministrator and joining us back in\n\n8\n00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.975\nthe studio to help us in that effort\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.175\nDon, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:29.915\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.055\n&gt;&gt; Things are going great.\n\n12\n00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:32.962\nReady to dive into a pretty neat episode.\n\n13\n00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:34.650\nAnd with the last couple of episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.835\nwe got a chance to see how they install\nUbuntu and how to install Fedora.\n\n15\n00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:39.284\nWe did it by hand,\nwe did it the manual way.\n\n16\n00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:43.675\nAnd that's great for home users,\nbut what about in the enterprise?\n\n17\n00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:47.310\nWhat if I need to install\na thousand machines?\n\n18\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.356\nThat's gonna be a lot of\nbutton clicking right.\n\n19\n00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.360\nA lot of moving through, so\nit's not really realistic.\n\n20\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.590\nAnd so in this episode, we're gonna take\na look at a technology called Kickstart.\n\n21\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.290\nAnd Kickstart allows us to automate the\ninstallation, and that is a life saver,\n\n22\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.720\nespecially if you're doing\nhundreds of thousands of machines.\n\n23\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.745\nYou get things done really, really quick.\n\n24\n00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:05.646\nFor home users it's pointless.\n\n25\n00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:08.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For small businesses it's pointless but\n\n26\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.690\nfor medium, large and\nespecially enterprise businesses.\n\n27\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.280\nThis is a critical technology so\na lot of people don't know about it and\n\n28\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.900\nthey go to work in these larger\nenvironments and things become really\n\n29\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.805\nchallenging But it's a great technology,\nit's part of Linux, it's right there.\n\n30\n00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:23.135\nWe can make use of it and\nwe can really speed up that install.\n\n31\n00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:24.852\nSo that's what we're gonna look\nat right here in this episode.\n\n32\n00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:27.885\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, you and I have both\nworked in the enterprise level, and\n\n33\n00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:31.804\nif there's one thing I learned from that\nis if we have computers, it's because they\n\n34\n00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:35.825\ncan automate things, and automation is\nawesome for when we're at that level.\n\n35\n00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:40.110\nSo I'm really excited to learn how the\nheck we automate the Linux installation,\n\n36\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.460\nwhich can be a little time consuming.\n\n37\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.372\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\nAnd, if you take the time to fully\n\n38\n00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:47.465\nautomate your environment, you can make\nit where when you get a new computer,\n\n39\n00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.027\nyou plug it into the network.\n\n40\n00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:51.977\nYou push power, and\nit automatically goes on the network,\n\n41\n00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:55.694\ndownloads the operating system,\nformats the machine, installs the OS,\n\n42\n00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:58.750\nwith the software configured\nthe way that you want it.\n\n43\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.660\nAnd the machine is up and ready to go.\n\n44\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.530\n&gt;&gt; The heck you say?\n&gt;&gt; And all had to do is push the power\n\n45\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.670\nbutton, right?\n\n46\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.090\nThat technology is there.\n\n47\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.310\nIt just takes time to get it set up.\n\n48\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.960\nIn fact it takes so\nmuch time to get set up, that for\n\n49\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.780\nsmall businesses if you have five or\nten computers,\n\n50\n00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.820\nit's faster to just do the install\nyourself and press next ten times right?\n\n51\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.170\nBut if you've got a thousand computers.\n\n52\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.693\nImagine if you had to set those\nup you could go one at a time and\n\n53\n00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:21.526\nif you're an hourly employ that is great.\n\n54\n00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:22.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n55\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.220\n&gt;&gt; Right but if you're salaried\nyou got better things to do and\n\n56\n00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.870\nif you wanted to do 1,000 of them all at\nthe same time well I'd need to make 1,000\n\n57\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.055\nUSB keys wouldn't I?\n\n58\n00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:32.743\nI mean heck just making USB keys in and\n\n59\n00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:35.687\nof themselves is a pain because\nevery time an update comes out for\n\n60\n00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:39.040\nthe OS I gotta make new USB keys so\nthat's not even realistic.\n\n61\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.350\nSo using technologies like Kickstart and\nPixie Boot, Pixie is the preexecution\n\n62\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.350\nenvironment it allows you to boot\nan operating system off of the network.\n\n63\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.590\nThose kinda things allow us to speed\nup deployment much much faster and\n\n64\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.380\nin the enterprise it's all about speed.\n\n65\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.164\nIf I have a problem on my laptop\nI can spend half an hour or\n\n66\n00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:59.040\nan hour figuring out the problem,\nfixing it and getting it going.\n\n67\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.371\nBut in the enterprise environment where\nthere is ten more people waiting in line\n\n68\n00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:04.220\nwith problems, you don't have that hour.\n\n69\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.620\nDaniel, we work together\nat an insurance company.\n\n70\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.686\nIf you were on the phone with somebody and\nthey had had a problem with their computer\n\n71\n00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:13.275\nand 20, 25 minutes goes by and\nyou haven't solved the problem.\n\n72\n00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:14.747\nWhat do we do?\n&gt;&gt; They get a new computer.\n\n73\n00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:16.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was it.\n\n74\n00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:21.275\nWe just send them out a new computer and\nback then we used to actually mail it,\n\n75\n00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:24.575\nbox up a computer, send it to them and\nthey'd swap it out and return the old one.\n\n76\n00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:25.855\nNow we don't have to do that.\n\n77\n00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:27.495\nWe can just redeploy the O/S.\n\n78\n00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:31.375\nWe can format their machine,\nerase it, redeploy the O/S fresh and\n\n79\n00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:35.320\nclean ready to go and that'll solve most\nproblems except for hardware problems.\n\n80\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.270\nSo this is what you see in\nthe enterprise environment and\n\n81\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.610\nit all starts by automating\nprocesses we already do.\n\n82\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Don you mentioned\na term back there.\n\n83\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.330\nAnd I know our audience members,\nthey're hip, they're with it,\n\n84\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.900\nthey know all about this link stuff.\n\n85\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.470\nBut you said kickstarts, and\nlet's pretend I don't know what that is.\n\n86\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.902\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:53.553\n&gt;&gt; What the heck is Kickstart?\n\n88\n00:03:53.553 --> 00:04:00.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, when you install Red Hat,\nFedora or right?\n\n89\n00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.470\nAll three of those,\ncuz they all kind of key off of Red Hat.\n\n90\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.090\nWhen you do the install,\nit launches the Anaconda installer, right?\n\n91\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.610\nAnd the Anaconda installer\nasks you a bunch of questions\n\n92\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.720\nthat you have to answer.\n\n93\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.050\nWhat you don't realize is\nthat in the background,\n\n94\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.940\nit says I wonder if these\nguys are using kickstart.\n\n95\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.590\nAnd if they are,\nI can get all the answers ahead of time.\n\n96\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.240\nKickstart is a system where we provide\nanswers to Anaconda's questions\n\n97\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.450\nIn a predefined format, so\nit doesn't have to ask us.\n\n98\n00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.360\nSo the install can run automatically.\n\n99\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.990\nA lot of people refer to this\nas an unattended installation\n\n100\n00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.440\nbecause you can start it and\njust walk away.\n\n101\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.230\nYou don't have to watch it.\n\n102\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.560\nIt'll answer everything just\nthe way that you want to.\n\n103\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.343\nSome people call it an LTE,\na light touch, or\n\n104\n00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:44.260\nLTI light touch installation or\neven a ZTI, a zero touch installation.\n\n105\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.427\nYou never truly have zero though cuz\nsomebody's gotta push that power button.\n\n106\n00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:49.750\nThere's gonna be a touch there somewhere.\n\n107\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.460\nBut that's what kickstart is,\nit's really just an answer file.\n\n108\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.030\nIt's answering all the questions.\n\n109\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.840\nWell what were the questions we had?\n\n110\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.280\nWe had to accept a license.\n\n111\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.690\nWe had to pick a hard drive to install.\n\n112\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.220\nWe had to set up partitioning.\n\n113\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.660\nWe had to create a user account,\n\n114\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.850\nset a time zone,\nmaybe configure a network adapter right?\n\n115\n00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.840\nNothing earth shattering here,\nnot hard stuff,\n\n116\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.090\nit's just stuff that had to be\nprovided as part of the core install.\n\n117\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.720\nSo what kickstart does is it allows us to\nbuild a file that has those answers and\n\n118\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.750\nwhen you start the installer,\nIt looks for that file.\n\n119\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.770\nAnd it can actually look\nseveral different places.\n\n120\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.900\nNow a file can be right on the CD.\n\n121\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.186\nSo now, I pop in the CD,\nI boot off the installer.\n\n122\n00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:29.760\nOr USB, let's do it in modern times.\n\n123\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.310\nSo I can put that right on the USB key.\n\n124\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.760\nI plug in the USB key, I boot it up,\nand the install starts and\n\n125\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.940\nit sees that kickstart file right?\n\n126\n00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.020\nIt looks for a particular name.\n\n127\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.099\nIt can be called ks.cfg, right, ks for\nkickstart and cfg it's a config file.\n\n128\n00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.500\n[LAUGH] Or you can call it kickstart.cfg.\n\n129\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.300\nWe normally call it ks.cfg.\n\n130\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.350\nSo it looks for\nit right there on the install media.\n\n131\n00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.269\nAnd it's got it there great but let me\ntell you while that is one option right.\n\n132\n00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:59.677\nThat's probably the easiest option, you\nput it on the install media, it reads it,\n\n133\n00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:03.240\nit answers everything, it's better to\nput it on the network somewhere right?\n\n134\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.860\nBecause let's say that I make these\nUSB keys with the install and\n\n135\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.430\nI put KS.cfg on there right?\n\n136\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.018\nWhen it boots up it's gonna see that,\nit's gonna answer it,\n\n137\n00:06:11.018 --> 00:06:12.465\nit's gonna move forward but\nwhat if I want to change it?\n\n138\n00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:15.710\nI'll say I need to change\none of the answers in there.\n\n139\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.840\nIf I've made ten of these keys or mailed\nthe keys out I've gotta get them back so\n\n140\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.000\nI can update them or\nreplace them it's kind of a pain.\n\n141\n00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.950\nBut if I put that ks.cfg on my network now\nthe installer could look to the network\n\n142\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.000\nand find it and anytime I wanted to modify\nthat answer file I could just go and\n\n143\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.360\nmodify it on the network and\nnow it's updated for everybody.\n\n144\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.110\nSo that's usually the better choice.\n\n145\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.920\nWhen you decide to do kickstart,\nthere is really two steps for it.\n\n146\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.137\nOne, is building the answer file,\nand then two,\n\n147\n00:06:41.137 --> 00:06:44.600\nis making the installer\nfind the answer file.\n\n148\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.480\nSo let's start with the easy part.\n\n149\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.070\nBuilding the answer file.\n\n150\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.030\nThere's two different ways\nto build the answer files.\n\n151\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.210\nThe old way and the new way.\n\n152\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.870\nThe old way was to use a configuration\ncommand right on your own system.\n\n153\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.208\nSo I've got Fedora fired up here but\nit's the same on RedHat, same on CentOS.\n\n154\n00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:04.045\nSo it's the same for all three, in fact I\ncan be on Fedora and make kick start files\n\n155\n00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:09.270\nfor CentOS, or for RedHat cuz the format\nis identical between all the three.\n\n156\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.380\nSo the command that I want requires\na few packages to be installed.\n\n157\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.440\nAnd you might already have some of these\npackages or you can install them yourself.\n\n158\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.660\nOn newer systems what you\nwould run is sudo dnf install.\n\n159\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.241\nAnd I'm gonna install\nsystem-config-kickstart and\n\n160\n00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.657\nI'm gonna install python-kickstart.\n\n161\n00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:36.055\nOkay, that's gonna install\nthe two packages and\n\n162\n00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:39.766\nactually it ends up installing like five\npackages to get those on my system and\n\n163\n00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:41.800\nget them up and going, all right?\n\n164\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.820\nNow if you go out on the Internet,\n\n165\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.970\nyou may see other configuration commands\nthat it provided, like some people\n\n166\n00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.060\nwill say sudo yum installed cuz\nthat's the old package manager.\n\n167\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.854\nThat still works.\n\n168\n00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:54.605\nAnd instead python.kickstart they\nmight say py-kickstart, right,\n\n169\n00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:56.581\npy-kick start that's the old name.\n\n170\n00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.758\nThat still works, too.\n\n171\n00:07:57.758 --> 00:08:00.990\nSo if you're reading documentation that\nshows the old commands, they still work.\n\n172\n00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.300\nIt's mapped to the same thing, but this\nis the actual correct command, sudo dmf.\n\n173\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.700\nThe reason you still see the old stuff\nis Red Hat hasn't moved over to dmf yet.\n\n174\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.870\nIt's got it.\nYou can stall it, but\n\n175\n00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.570\nit's not there by default.\n\n176\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.370\nSo they're still in Yum.\n\n177\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.480\nSo that command works.\n\n178\n00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.070\nIt works here on Fedora, as well.\n\n179\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.360\nSo I I could say sudo yum install\nsystem-config-kickstart and\n\n180\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.020\npi kickstart, and it would get set up.\n\n181\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.100\nBut I need those installed.\n\n182\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.980\nAnd I've already got them in my system,\nso if I try and\n\n183\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.010\nrun that it's not gonna work actually.\n\n184\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.240\nIt's already installed.\n\n185\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.860\nBut those are the utilities that I need.\n\n186\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.720\nNow, I'm not actually gonna\nrun python kickstart,\n\n187\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.460\nthat's a thing that\nruns in the background.\n\n188\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:40.420\nBut I am gonna run system\n-config -kickstart and\n\n189\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.600\nI don't have to run it from\nthe command line like this,\n\n190\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.170\nit actually gets an icon\nbecause it's a GUI utility.\n\n191\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.340\nIf I take a look at my\napplication launcher and\n\n192\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.720\nI just type kickstart I'll find it\nright there and it'll launch up and\n\n193\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.670\nhere's the kickstart configurator\nright system/config/kickstart.\n\n194\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.230\nAnd it is asking me the questions\nwe get during an install.\n\n195\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.120\nIt is actually asking even more, right?\n\n196\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.940\nThe install asks a basic set of questions.\n\n197\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.310\nThis goes even further.\n\n198\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.380\nI can come in here and\ntweak my install to match my needs.\n\n199\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.620\nSo, if we take a look at\nthe questions it is asking,\n\n200\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.329\nit starts with the basic configuration,\nright.\n\n201\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.560\nThis is the things I have\nto have to do the install.\n\n202\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.400\nIs asking me for a language in\nthe keyboard and a time zone.\n\n203\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.406\nNow mine is defaulting to Abidjan.\n\n204\n00:09:24.406 --> 00:09:27.824\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And it's just cuz is alphabetized.\n\n205\n00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:33.410\nSo I can go in here and\nI can find America /United States.\n\n206\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.400\nOr you know whatever country it\nis that you happen to be in and\n\n207\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.290\nactually these are cities so\nI need America / New York.\n\n208\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.570\nI'll find that so\nI can get my timezone set right.\n\n209\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.680\nI can provide a root password so\nwe can whatever it is that I want people\n\n210\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.610\nto use as that root password and I do need\nto be a little bit careful because this is\n\n211\n00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.900\ngonna be stored in the Kickstart file and\nthe Kickstart file is just a text file.\n\n212\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.930\nSo this next option says to\nencrypt the root password.\n\n213\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.520\nIf I don't do that, the root password is\nnow in plain text in the Kickstart file.\n\n214\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.570\nSo if somebody gets ahold of one of my\nUSB keys they can see what the root\n\n215\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.330\npassword is right there.\n\n216\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:06.940\nThat would be a problem.\n\n217\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.100\nSo it is encrypted by default,\nthat's what I want.\n\n218\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.310\nI can then specific a target architecture.\n\n219\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.030\nWell, we don't really have to worry about\nthis too much any more, because Red Hat\n\n220\n00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.660\nand Fedora and Centos really focus on\nthat x86 64 environment, this first one.\n\n221\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.070\nBut there versions of Centos out there for\nItanium and iSeries and pSeries, so\n\n222\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.920\nyou can change that.\n\n223\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.140\nBut this is the one we really want.\n\n224\n00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.570\nThe other ones are different,\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n225\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.450\nYou can choose to reboot the system\nafter installation, if you watched our\n\n226\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.000\ninstalling Fedora episode at the end\nit didn't automatically reboot.\n\n227\n00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.470\nBut if we provided all the answers, it's\ngot everything it needs we can have it\n\n228\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.600\nautomatically reboot so it'll be ready\nto go as soon as that install is done.\n\n229\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.080\n&gt;&gt; And I guess if you're doing\na light touch type of installation\n\n230\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.390\none less touch is always better.\n\n231\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right you're trying to\nget it as automated as possible.\n\n232\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.220\nAnd you can even choose to perform\nthe installation in text mode.\n\n233\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.150\nIt'll do graphics by default but it\ndoesn't really matter to us cuz it's not\n\n234\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.750\ngoing to be showing\nthese questions anyway.\n\n235\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.330\nIt's all automated, right.\n\n236\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.200\nSo you can choose that.\n\n237\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.820\nI usually just leave it in the graphical\nmode anyway though just because.\n\n238\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.840\nAfter that there's other information I\ncan provide like the installation method.\n\n239\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.120\nAm I doing a new install or\nupgrading, right?\n\n240\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.650\nWe can automate upgrades with this which\nis a pretty handy thing to do, too.\n\n241\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.300\nAnd where's the installation coming from?\n\n242\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.820\nNow this one can be a little bit tricky\nbecause if you're installing from a USB\n\n243\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.780\nkey, which one is it?\n\n244\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.640\nWell, a USB key would\nactually be a hard drive.\n\n245\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.870\nSo I would choose that as\nmy installation source.\n\n246\n00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.090\nYou've got CD-ROM, network file system,\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n247\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.970\nYour install can be coming from\nany number of different places.\n\n248\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.970\nI'll go ahead and choose hard drive.\n\n249\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.360\nIf you choose hard drive it's\ngonna ask for that partition so\n\n250\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.760\nyou need to know where that USB key\nis going to be mounted to provide it.\n\n251\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.520\nSo you can do that.\n\n252\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.300\nI've seen people where they've scripted so\nthe mount name is always the same.\n\n253\n00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.100\nYou can certainly do that, too,\nor you can leave it at CD-ROM.\n\n254\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.020\nA lot of times if you don't\nmess with the installer,\n\n255\n00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.880\nit'll actually map the USB key to be\nreferenced as a CD-ROM for Anaconda.\n\n256\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.200\nIt doesn't do that after the boot, though,\nbut during the Anaconda phase it can.\n\n257\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.390\nSo you can specify where\nthat's coming from.\n\n258\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.210\nAfter that we can do boot loader options,\n\n259\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.140\nthe boot loader we don't\ntypically need to mess with except\n\n260\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.460\nif you look at the default do not\ninstall a boot loader is chosen.\n\n261\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.100\nSo let's say that this is\na completely blank system,\n\n262\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.030\nit's gonna install Fedora,\nor Red Hat, or whatever.\n\n263\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.090\nAnd if it doesn't put a Boot Loader\nin there when you reboot,\n\n264\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.180\nit's not gonna boot.\n\n265\n00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.540\nSo we need a Boot Loader.\n\n266\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.630\nSo I'm gonna change\nthat to say install it.\n\n267\n00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.140\nAnd you can set a GRUB\npassword if you need it, or\n\n268\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.800\nany of the other values that you\nmight need to change or manipulate.\n\n269\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.650\nI want to install the Boot Loader\nin the Master Boot Record, so\n\n270\n00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.600\nthat's exactly what I want.\n\n271\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.220\nAnd then we can do our partitioning,\nright?\n\n272\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.590\nI can erase the drive as it stands.\n\n273\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.490\nSo I can clear out the master boot record\nand I can remove all existing partitions\n\n274\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.190\nif that's what I want or\nI can leave them there and modify things.\n\n275\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.230\nNow, if I'm trying to automate,\n\n276\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.260\nI don't necessarily know the partition\nscheme of every machine I'm deploying to.\n\n277\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.180\nSo usually we do wanna just\nblow the machine away.\n\n278\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.020\nErase everything that's on it and\n\n279\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.920\nthen we're going to create\na new partition layout.\n\n280\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.212\nAnd so right here I can come in and\nI can add what that layout is gonna be.\n\n281\n00:13:01.212 --> 00:13:05.510\nAt a minimum, I need a root, well, really,\n\n282\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.470\nI just need a root but I might choose\nto do a swap and some other things.\n\n283\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.290\nSo for example, this first one I might\ncome in and say that I'm gonna do a swap.\n\n284\n00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.480\nNow swap doesn't technically\nhave a mount point.\n\n285\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.480\nI would come in here in the format and\ntell it that I was doing swap and\n\n286\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.290\nI don't need it,\nsee the mount box just grayed out.\n\n287\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.880\nSo I'm gonna create a swap partition and\nmaybe I'll want it to be 2 gigs in size,\n\n288\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.580\nor I guess I need to say 2048,\nlike that to get 2 actual gigabytes.\n\n289\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.498\nAnd so that's gonna be it.\n\n290\n00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:38.170\nI'll say okay to that, and then I'll\nadd in my home partition as well.\n\n291\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.043\nI like being zoomed in, but\nI'm gonna get motion sickness.\n\n292\n00:13:41.043 --> 00:13:43.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm gonna come in here and\n\n293\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.520\ndo the root one, and I'll just\ntell it to fill unused disk space.\n\n294\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.320\nCuz again, I don't know the size of the\ndisks that I'm deploying to, so I'll just\n\n295\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.740\nsay create a two gig swap, and then\neverything else goes in here in Slash.\n\n296\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.930\nI might not wanna do that.\n\n297\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.420\nI might wanna set a slash boot.\n\n298\n00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.900\nA lot of people break that one out.\n\n299\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.740\nAnd I could do maybe two gigs for\nthat one as well.\n\n300\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.620\nSo there's my slash boot.\n\n301\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.000\nReally handy to have a separate slash\nboot if you are going to be encrypting.\n\n302\n00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.770\nAnd so then I'll add the slash.\n\n303\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.090\nAnd I'll just let that take\neverything else, okay.\n\n304\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.090\nSo that's kind of indeterminate\none that last partition\n\n305\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.040\nbecause I don't know the size of\nthe discs that I'm deploying to.\n\n306\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.100\nAll right, now, then right there\n\n307\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.890\nanswers all the critical\nquestions during an install.\n\n308\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.290\nWith that information\nthat I just provided.\n\n309\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.930\nI could fire up a Fedora install and\nit'll walk right through and\n\n310\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.950\nthe user won't get asked anything and\nit'll finish the install.\n\n311\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.200\n&gt;&gt; So you don't have to walk through\neach one of the options here,\n\n312\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.560\njust the ones that will get\nthe installation going.\n\n313\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep.\nSo that's kinda the bare minimum,\n\n314\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.380\nthose first four, right?\n\n315\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.090\nAnd if you remember watching that episode,\nthe Fedora install,\n\n316\n00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.360\nwhich is the same for Redis, same for\n\n317\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.430\nCentOS, that Anaconda really just had\nthose section that we had to answer.\n\n318\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.280\nEverything else here is kind of optional.\n\n319\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.220\nYou can do a network configuration,\nif you don't, by default.\n\n320\n00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.780\nIt'll activate network adapters and\nset them up for DHCP.\n\n321\n00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.580\nSo that's easy enough.\n\n322\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.950\nAuthentication, we can define whether\nwe're connected to a Kerberos realm or for\n\n323\n00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.930\ndoing NIS or\nsomething like that we can define it.\n\n324\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.460\nOur firewall configuration, you can\nallow ports and protocols to be able to\n\n325\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.590\npass through the firewall or lock it\ndown or even turn the firewall off.\n\n326\n00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.580\nYou can customize whether SE Linux,\nthe security enhanced Linux is gonna be\n\n327\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.780\nrunning, change that security level\nto however it is that we want.\n\n328\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.710\nNotice my firewall's\ndisabled by default here.\n\n329\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.150\nI might wanna turn that on.\n\n330\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.580\nI've got that option, I'll go ahead and\ndo that, I'll turn on that Firewall.\n\n331\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.610\nAnd I might want to put\nexceptions in there, like for\n\n332\n00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.480\nSSH, because I might want to be able\nto remote manage these machines.\n\n333\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.030\nAs long as SSH is turned on,\nI'll be able to connect in and\n\n334\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.550\ndeploy any other changes that I want.\n\n335\n00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.883\nUnder display, I can configure that.\n\n336\n00:15:47.883 --> 00:15:52.001\nWe do have to be a little bit careful with\nthe display because you're kinda uncertain\n\n337\n00:15:52.001 --> 00:15:53.748\nof the video adapter systems have.\n\n338\n00:15:53.748 --> 00:15:56.800\nBut notice it just says install\na graphical environment which is\n\n339\n00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.598\npretty simple.\n\n340\n00:15:57.598 --> 00:16:01.022\nAnd then whether or\nnot we want to do the setup agent.\n\n341\n00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:04.413\nWhen I first logged in, I got the known\nsetup agent that asked me again,\n\n342\n00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:08.020\nwhat language I spoke, whether I\nwanted to link my could accounts.\n\n343\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.020\nIf I leave it disabled\nthat doesn't pop up.\n\n344\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.010\nI kind of like that.\n\n345\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.210\nI could drop in down and enable it,\nand then it would run through and\n\n346\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.060\nask those questions.\n\n347\n00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.360\nNow it's not really zero touch anymore.\n\n348\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.720\nIf someone gets a new computer,\nthey still have to answer a few questions.\n\n349\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.430\nBut if we're using the default language,\nwe can just disable that and\n\n350\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.330\nnow they don't even see that,\nthey go right to a desktop.\n\n351\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.350\nThen we got package selection,\nwhat packages do I want to install?\n\n352\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.080\nAnd I can pick and choose, maybe I wat\nhe Firefox Web Browser, so I can check\n\n353\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.010\nthat off, or GNOME, which, I chose to\ndo a GUI, so it's gonna do that anyway.\n\n354\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.860\nI don't actually know why it doesn't\ncheck that off by default but\n\n355\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.870\nwe can pick each of these\ndifferent components.\n\n356\n00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.156\nWe can do other desktops and\n[INAUDIBLE] like KDE or XFCE.\n\n357\n00:16:45.156 --> 00:16:47.792\nWe got those options,\ncinnamon, [INAUDIBLE]-\n\n358\n00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:48.558\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot.\n\n359\n00:16:48.558 --> 00:16:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tons of stuff.\n\n360\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:54.384\nAnd as you scroll down you'll see the\nother things like the base system where we\n\n361\n00:16:54.384 --> 00:16:56.410\nhave fonts and Java, system tools.\n\n362\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.393\nThese are things that you may choose to\ninstall or might choose to leave off,\n\n363\n00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.174\nyou don't want your end\nusers to have those.\n\n364\n00:17:01.174 --> 00:17:04.890\nWe're making all of these\ndecisions right here okay?\n\n365\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.490\nAnd there's quite a bit\nof uncategorized stuff.\n\n366\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.040\nIf you kind of sift through here you'll\nfind all sorts of interesting things.\n\n367\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Support for other languages.\n\n368\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.000\n&gt;&gt; Yep if you wanna do more than one\nlanguage which many companies need to do.\n\n369\n00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.560\nUnder applications is probably where\nyou'll spend the most time though cuz\n\n370\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.980\nhere's where you'll find\nthings like Libre Office.\n\n371\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.630\nYou know, maybe I want to install\nLibreOffice, I want to have that present.\n\n372\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.810\nSo we can specify a lot of that stuff and\nget that set up.\n\n373\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.350\nBe aware that when you choose these,\n\n374\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.590\nsome of these have optional\npackages inside of them.\n\n375\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.720\nNothing I picked did, but down here\nI've got this optional package button.\n\n376\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.460\nAnd that's where you can pick the optional\ncomponents for that software.\n\n377\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.900\nThen, what if there something\nwe wanna do that wasn't in\n\n378\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.830\nall those options that I just showed you?\n\n379\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.950\nWell, there is pre-installation scripts\nand post-installation scripts, right.\n\n380\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.980\nI can just write a shell script that does\nwhatever I want prior to the install.\n\n381\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.000\nSo maybe I want to manually\ndo my partitioning.\n\n382\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.210\nSeparate from the installs, so\n\n383\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.280\nI could have a Pre-Installation Script to\nget everything set up or maybe the network\n\n384\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.340\nadapter gets detected with some weird\nname so I wanna map it to ETA to zero.\n\n385\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.290\nSo that I can assign it an IP\nfrom my network configuration.\n\n386\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.620\nSo, I could do that pre-install script or\npost-install script maybe\n\n387\n00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.950\nafter it installs fedora, I want it to\nreach out to a network location and\n\n388\n00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.360\nrestore a back up of the user's profile.\n\n389\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.610\nSo now it has their documents and\nbookmarks and\n\n390\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:28.940\nall that other stuff gets brought back.\n\n391\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.410\nI could do that in\na post-installation script.\n\n392\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.390\nThese features are only limited\nby your ability to script.\n\n393\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.650\nCuz you can script it to do anything.\n\n394\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.660\nSo that's where you can fill that in and\n\n395\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.870\nreally create some power\nhere inside of Kickstart.\n\n396\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.060\nAnd when this is all done,\nyou can save it.\n\n397\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.490\nSo I'll go up here and\nchoose file and save.\n\n398\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:56.700\nAnd it's gonna save it as ks.cfg, there's\nthat file name, right there, ks.cfg.\n\n399\n00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.400\nAnd when I save that file,\nI'll just stick it in my home folder here.\n\n400\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.320\nWhen you save that file it's\njust a text file right and\n\n401\n00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.825\nI can go into my terminal and\ntake a look at that file,\n\n402\n00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:15.600\nks.cfg let me do a less on that file and\n\n403\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.620\nI can scroll through and\nsee all the answers to those questions.\n\n404\n00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.820\nNow if I had to figure this text out\non my own, it'd be kinda hard, right?\n\n405\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.570\nThe way this is written.\n\n406\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.650\n&gt;&gt; It is divided in sections, and so\nyou've got different pieces broken off\n\n408\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.430\nfrom others, but it's nice to have that\nGUI utility that builds this for us, okay?\n\n409\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.730\nNow, I will be honest with you,\n\n410\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.370\nI don't actually use this utility\nto generate my kickstarts.\n\n411\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.390\nAnd the reason I don't is because\nthe packages chang so frequently and\n\n412\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.340\nthis utility doesn't get\nupdated as often as it should.\n\n413\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.010\nIf you go and\nread the bug reports on this utility,\n\n414\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.140\nyou'll see even the authors are saying we\ndon't update this as much as we should.\n\n415\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.710\nSo Red Hat acknowledges that and\nif you go to redhat.com and sign up for\n\n416\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.920\nour free account, in their user portal\nthey have a web based version of that\n\n417\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.960\nutility called the kickstart generator and\nthis one gets updated all the time, right?\n\n418\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.370\nThis one is really good.\n\n419\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.765\nIt's identical to what I just\nrun from the command line.\n\n420\n00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:10.460\nInstall it.\n\n421\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.300\nSo you'll see all this same options\nthat's right here on the left and\n\n422\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.288\nover here on the right.\n\n423\n00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:19.870\nIt's identical, it really is\neverything we saw on that last tool\n\n424\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.750\nright here in a simple webpage, okay?\n\n425\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.760\nSo the cool part is I can come through and\nstart to fill all this out and\n\n426\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.750\nwhen I'm done I can hit this big\nred button up here to download it.\n\n427\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.380\nThe thing I like about this tool,\nthough, is at the top left.\n\n428\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.330\nSee how this is generating a file for\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7?\n\n429\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.060\nIf you drop it down I can do version 6 and\nversion 5, I can choose older version so\n\n430\n00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.580\nthat I don't see features that\naren't supported on them and\n\n431\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.770\nwith the packages that makes\na big difference right?\n\n432\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.080\nSo I usually use this\nthe web based utility and\n\n433\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.470\nyou don't have to buy Red Hat to use it,\nyou can actually use a free account.\n\n434\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.830\nAnd it will generate that file and\nget created.\n\n435\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:21:00.610\nNow one big problem with Kickstarter,\nor Kickstart, not Kickstarter.\n\n436\n00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.560\nBut with Kickstart, is that if\nyou're crafting the final by hand,\n\n437\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.450\nit's super easy to make a mistake.\n\n438\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.950\nAnd if you make a mistake in this file,\nit's not going to work.\n\n439\n00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.030\nAnd so from there you need\nto validate your syntax.\n\n440\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.910\nAnd when I installed\nthe Python-Kickstart or Py-Kickstart,\n\n441\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.380\nit installed the utility called\nthe ksvalidator, right, ksvalidator.\n\n442\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:27.110\nAnd that utility, we can run it and\npoint it at our file that we just made.\n\n443\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.650\nSo I'm gonna point it at ks.cfg.\n\n444\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.470\nAnd when I run that, it's gonna check\nit and look for any errors, okay?\n\n445\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.695\nAnd when I ran it, I got a warning that\none of the options that I created has\n\n446\n00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:41.370\nactually been deprecated, right?\n\n447\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.810\nIt hasn't been removed yet, but it's\nbeen deprecated, so I shouldn't use it.\n\n448\n00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.560\nAnd so it's, whatever this option\nthat was, actually you know what,\n\n449\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.400\nthat's an error.\n\n450\n00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.880\nThat's an error in the KS Validator\nitself, interesting.\n\n451\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.070\nAll right, well we can ignore that.\n\n452\n00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.595\n&gt;&gt; So never mind.\n\n453\n00:21:56.595 --> 00:21:57.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some\n\n454\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.880\nof these utilities are not being\nupdated like they should be.\n\n455\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.030\nSo this one's warning me that a little\npart of the KS Validator itself\n\n456\n00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.530\nis actually being invalidated.\n\n457\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.010\nNow, I'm not seeing any other messages and\nthat's usually a good thing.\n\n458\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.440\nWhat we expect is you run KS Validator and\nyou get nothing back.\n\n459\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That means there's no\n\n460\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.930\nproblems in your file.\n\n461\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.140\nBut if there was,\nit would show you the problem.\n\n462\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.150\nHere it's just warning you that one of\nthe instructions needs to be updated but\n\n463\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.370\nthe file itself is fine, okay.\n\n464\n00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.660\nIf I had used the web page\nto generate the KS file,\n\n465\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.020\nI wouldn't even need to do the validator\nright, or I used the software to do it so\n\n466\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.270\nI'm fine here too, but\n\n467\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:36.130\nif you craft it yourself from hand you'll\nwanna use KS validator and verify that so.\n\n468\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.400\nSo anyhow,\nthat's one that needs to be fixed.\n\n469\n00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.135\nAll right, once we've got the ks\nfile made though there it is,\n\n470\n00:22:43.135 --> 00:22:47.460\nks.cfg, I can build a USB installer.\n\n471\n00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.570\nAnd all I have to do is copy that ks.cfg\nfile to the root of that USB installer.\n\n472\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.390\nSo you go back to our installing Fedora\nepisode where we built the USB key.\n\n473\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.520\nYou put the USB key into your computer.\n\n474\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.923\nYou just copy this to the root of it.\n\n475\n00:22:57.923 --> 00:23:02.703\nAnd now when the install starts, it will\nlook and it will find that ks file and\n\n476\n00:23:02.703 --> 00:23:04.495\nwhen it goes to the install,\n\n477\n00:23:04.495 --> 00:23:08.991\nit will answer all the questions\nautomatically and off you go, right?\n\n478\n00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:14.729\nAnother option and I don't think I'm\ngonna have the time to do this but\n\n479\n00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:19.591\nif you have the ISO image of the CD,\nyou can extract the CD and\n\n480\n00:23:19.591 --> 00:23:23.690\nyou can modify it to tell it to look for\nthe KS file.\n\n481\n00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:27.440\nAnd the nice part about doing it\nthat way is you can actually see\n\n482\n00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.300\nwhere you can point to\nother locations right?\n\n483\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.740\nSo I'll put all the instructions\nin the show notes and\n\n484\n00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.030\nshow you how to do this whole process.\n\n485\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.600\nBut let me show you the really important\npart, the part that's confusing.\n\n486\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.010\nSo I'm gonna mount that ISO image so\nI can get some files out of it and\n\n487\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.750\nwhen you do that, so if I go into my home,\nI'm gonna mount this ISO.\n\n488\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.765\nSo I'll choose to open that\nwith a disk mount utility.\n\n489\n00:23:50.765 --> 00:23:52.854\n&gt;&gt; I think Tar would do it in the,\nI looked at G Zip,\n\n490\n00:23:52.854 --> 00:23:56.113\nI don't think G Zip will do it but\nI think Tar will actually do this as well.\n\n491\n00:23:56.113 --> 00:23:57.033\n&gt;&gt; Will extract the ISO?\n\n492\n00:23:57.033 --> 00:23:57.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n493\n00:23:57.755 --> 00:24:01.426\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna do it this way\nbecause it's gonna allow me to.\n\n494\n00:24:01.426 --> 00:24:02.570\nJust browse into the cd and\n\n495\n00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.381\ngrab the files that need instead\nof attracting the whole thing.\n\n496\n00:24:05.381 --> 00:24:10.181\nBut the file that I really wanna\nmess with in here, on the CD you've\n\n497\n00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:15.280\ngot a number of folders in here\nright like EFI, ISO Linux and so on.\n\n498\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.780\nThat ISO Linux folder If\nyou go into that folder,\n\n499\n00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:25.500\nthere's a couple files in there, and\nthe one I'm looking for is isolinux.cfg.\n\n500\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.030\nThat's the configuration file that has\nthe boot options when the CD boots up.\n\n501\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:34.810\nAnd if you take a look at that file and\nwhat's inside of it,\n\n502\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.690\nit's got like this default\nvesamenu.c32 and timeout 600.\n\n503\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.450\nThese are the basic settings and\nthe menu items right here for\n\n504\n00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.200\nwhat's gonna happen when you\nchoose to do the install.\n\n505\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.500\nIf you look around in here, you'll\nfind where you get the menu item for\n\n506\n00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:55.450\ninstalling Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 or\ntest media and install.\n\n507\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.590\nAnd under this one right here where\nit's Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n508\n00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.730\nI could modify this append line?\n\n509\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.360\nTo tell it to look for\na Kickstart file on different location.\n\n510\n00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.940\nOr I could even add another\nmenu item this is like\n\n511\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.090\ninstall using Kickstart file right?\n\n512\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.910\nAnd when you do it this\nway you can change it,\n\n513\n00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.470\nso let me copy that in somewhere writable.\n\n514\n00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.720\n&gt;&gt; Temp directory.\n\n515\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.746\n&gt;&gt; Into my yeah home directory here.\n\n516\n00:25:20.746 --> 00:25:24.711\nAnd let me edit that file,\nokay so here I am in the file,\n\n517\n00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:29.456\nI can come down to that menu and\nI can choose to either modify the one\n\n518\n00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:34.389\nthat's already in there or\nI can just create a whole new menu entry.\n\n519\n00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:37.572\nIf I wanna I normally create a new menu\nentry but just because I've only got so\n\n520\n00:25:37.572 --> 00:25:38.690\nmuch time here.\n\n521\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.980\nLet me just say, modify this line,\nso I'll say with Kickstart.\n\n522\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.060\nSo on the screen, it'd actually say\nthat we're gonna install with Kickstart.\n\n523\n00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.291\nAnd I'm gonna take this line right here,\n\n524\n00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.352\nwhere it's telling it that\nwe're gonna do the install,\n\n525\n00:25:51.352 --> 00:25:55.649\nand I'm gonna go to the end of that line\nand I'm gonna add just a little bit to it.\n\n526\n00:25:55.649 --> 00:25:59.095\nAnd I'm gonna say ks = and\nI'm gonna tell it\n\n527\n00:25:59.095 --> 00:26:03.858\nwhere to find the kickstart file,\nnow it might be on a CDROM.\n\n528\n00:26:03.858 --> 00:26:08.274\nSo I could say CDROM:/folder/ks.cfg and\n\n529\n00:26:08.274 --> 00:26:12.339\nI could point it to where\nI want it right but\n\n530\n00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:17.566\nthe real power is that I could come in and\nI could tell it\n\n531\n00:26:17.566 --> 00:26:23.190\nsomething cool like\nhttp://diskserver/ks.cfg.\n\n532\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:28.140\nSo now it's gonna look for our web\nserver that's on my local network and\n\n533\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.490\nit's gonna get it from there or I'm not\nlimited to just http, I can do ftp, right?\n\n534\n00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.050\nAnd it would reach out to an ftp server,\n\n535\n00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.790\nand it would get the cache\nfile from there.\n\n536\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.960\nThat's the really cool way to do\nit cuz I can burn this to a CD.\n\n537\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.760\nAnd once it's burned to a CD I can go and\nboot it anywhere and\n\n538\n00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.160\nit's looking at the network for\nthis one file.\n\n539\n00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.150\nAny time I wanted to modify the file I'd\njust go right to that one place, and\n\n540\n00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.910\nI modify that file right?\n\n541\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.480\nI could have more than one kickstart file.\n\n542\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.830\nI can have one kickstart file for\nthe accounting department, and\n\n543\n00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.980\nanother kickstart file for\nthe sales department.\n\n544\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.620\nAnd the sales department one might have\npost installation scripts that installs\n\n545\n00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.050\ntheir sales software.\n\n546\n00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.820\nAnd the Human Resources Department has\na script that mounts the Human Resources\n\n547\n00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.980\nhard drive, or network share,\nto their system.\n\n548\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.920\nSo, now they're really customized, but\nit's all one install media, right, and\n\n549\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.400\nmenu items for each department.\n\n550\n00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.430\nSo, am I installing this for the sales\ndepartment, or marketing, or whatever?\n\n551\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.970\nThe part that takes a long time is,\nonce you customize this file, and\n\n552\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:26.640\nget it set the way that you want it to be,\nyou've got to, shoot its read only,\n\n553\n00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.760\nbecause I got it off the CD I should\nhave change my permissions on it.\n\n554\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.950\nBut once you've customize that file,\nwe've got to get it burn back into a CD or\n\n555\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.780\ninto a USB key.\n\n556\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.430\nWe'll if it's USB key you just copy it,\nnot a big deal.\n\n557\n00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.480\nBut if it's a CD you got\nto build an ISO image.\n\n558\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.680\nSo I'll put the instructions for\n\n559\n00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.719\nhow to build that ISO image\nright in the show notes.\n\n560\n00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.298\nIt's already done so I haven't [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n561\n00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:48.450\n&gt;&gt; But I'll put them in.\n\n562\n00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.230\nIt's not hard to do, but this is how\nwe really automate that install.\n\n563\n00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.850\nAnd in an enterprise environment this\nis how we're gonna install Linux.\n\n564\n00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.880\nI know I've focused on Red Hat,\nCentOS, and\n\n565\n00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.150\nFedora and that's because in businesses\nthat's the Linux that you run.\n\n566\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.230\nUbuntu has not really caught\non in that market, yet.\n\n567\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.870\nThey're still a little too\ncutting edge for most businesses.\n\n568\n00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.560\nAnd the other distros that\nare out there are just not really\n\n569\n00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.080\nsustainable in a business environment.\n\n570\n00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.620\nRed Hat has really cornered that market.\n\n571\n00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.940\nSo, this is how we automate it and\nthat's how we'd be performing\n\n572\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.838\ninstallations in\nan enterprise environment.\n\n573\n00:28:22.838 --> 00:28:27.440\n&gt;&gt; Wow, those other are really missing out\non some great functionality if they'd just\n\n574\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.340\nbe a little less flakey.\n\n575\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Some of them actually\nsupport Kickstart.\n\n576\n00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.370\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Some of them honor\n\n577\n00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.240\nthe Kickstart files, yep.\n\n578\n00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, they definitely need to start\npromoting that a little bit more cuz this\n\n579\n00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.450\nis the way to fly ladies and gentlemen.\n\n580\n00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.040\nIf you have the means,\nI do suggest it, that's for sure.\n\n581\n00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.310\nBecause who likes to sit around and\nwatch installation after installation,\n\n582\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.390\nhave to answer question after question,\nthe same time over and over again.\n\n583\n00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.250\nWhen you have that environment where\nyou're doing multiple installations,\n\n584\n00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.810\nthis is the way that you should be going.\n\n585\n00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.160\nIt does take a little setup, but once it's\nsetup your life becomes so much easier.\n\n586\n00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.780\nDon, we do thank you for\nshowing us how to use Kickstart and\n\n587\n00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.850\nif you were unaware that it was there,\n[LAUGH] then now you are in the know.\n\n588\n00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.080\nThat being said, Don, looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n589\n00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.270\nThanks again for joining us.\n\n590\n00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.400\nWe do thank our audience for watching,\nbut signing off for ITPro TV,\n\n591\n00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.780\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n592\n00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n593\n00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.567\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.943\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Hello, again, and thank you for\njoining us on ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.311\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:22.851\nI am Zach Memos and I'm your host on\nbecoming a Linux system administrator and\n\n7\n00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:25.006\nthis is dual-booting time.\n\n8\n00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:26.815\nAnd I know some people\nare excited about this,\n\n9\n00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:30.305\nI know I am and bringing us all\nthe information we need is Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:31.415\nDon, you are so smart.\n\n11\n00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.025\nPlease, please,\nimpart upon us your wisdom.\n\n12\n00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:35.770\nPlease.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you definitely got it right.\n\n13\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.260\nIn this episode, we're doing dual\nbooting cuz single bootings not enough.\n\n14\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.265\nWe need the double dose\n[CROSSTALK] of booting.\n\n15\n00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:44.137\nWe're going to be taking a look at how\nto run more than one operating system\n\n16\n00:00:44.137 --> 00:00:45.250\nsimultaneously.\n\n17\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.053\nWell, I shouldn't say simultaneously,\n\n18\n00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:50.064\nbut running more than one operating\nsystem natively on your hardware.\n\n19\n00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:50.840\nI'm gonna use a laptop.\n\n20\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.192\nSame as on a desktop but a neat process if\nyou're one of those people who can't just\n\n21\n00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.916\nfully dedicate yourself\nto one operating system.\n\n22\n00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.550\nAnd you've got a need to move back and\nforth between other ones.\n\n23\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.700\nWe're gonna take a look at that\nright here in this episode and\n\n24\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.740\nsee how to get that set up.\n\n25\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.565\n&gt;&gt; So that exactly is what dual\nbooting is, what you just said?\n\n26\n00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.180\n&gt;&gt; Well dual booting,\nIt's kinda interesting.\n\n27\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.380\nThere's a little more to it, right?\n\n28\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.890\nFirst off, we say dual booting,\n\n29\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.880\nso that could kinda let you know that\nwe're talking about booting up, right, and\n\n30\n00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.640\nwhen we boot, you've got this\nchoice between two different OS's.\n\n31\n00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.990\nBut it really shouldn't\nbe called dual booting,\n\n32\n00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.290\nit should be called multi-boot because\nyou could have more than two OS's.\n\n33\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.148\nNow the more you have,\nthe more complex it gets,\n\n34\n00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:30.287\nbecause a lot of operating systems\ndon't play nicely well together.\n\n35\n00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:32.478\nAnd so when you start getting three and\nfour and five, all of a sudden,\n\n36\n00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:34.060\nthings kind of flake out a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.545\nBut if we just focus on two,\nit's pretty easy to get two up and going.\n\n38\n00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:42.119\nAnd the idea is that I have two operating\nsystems installed on my hardware,\n\n39\n00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.473\nand when I push the power button,\nIt gives me a choice.\n\n40\n00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:48.890\nAnd it says do you want to boot\ninto operating system number one or\n\n41\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.264\noperating system number two and\nit might be Windows and Linux.\n\n42\n00:01:52.264 --> 00:01:56.481\nIt might be Mac OS and Linux, it might be\ntwo different Linux distros, it doesn't\n\n43\n00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:00.470\nmatter it's just two different operating\nsystems and you make that choice.\n\n44\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.640\nNow technically you are only running one\nat a time right, you make the choice and\n\n45\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.290\nfrom that time point on you are running\nthat OS until you reboot and\n\n46\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.740\nthen you can boot to the other.\n\n47\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.196\nSo, a lot of you might be thinking,\nwell wait a minute Don,\n\n48\n00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:13.537\nI can just do virtual machines.\n\n49\n00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:17.758\nI can have one OS on my laptop and\nthen use VMware or Virtual Box or\n\n50\n00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:21.501\nany other number of products\nthat are out there to do it,\n\n51\n00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.463\nto create virtual machines with other OSs.\n\n52\n00:02:24.463 --> 00:02:27.432\nWait, why would I want to do dual booting?\n\n53\n00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:29.184\nWell you make a good argument.\n\n54\n00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:33.598\nVirtual machines are a great solution,\nexcept virtual machines don't\n\n55\n00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:37.370\ngive you true,\nwhat's called bare metal performance.\n\n56\n00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.235\nWhen you have an OS running\ndirectly on the hardware,\n\n57\n00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:43.400\nit's able to take advantage of\nall of the bells and whistles.\n\n58\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.840\nAll the features all\nthe power of that hardware,\n\n59\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.920\nwhen joining in a virtual machine It\ndepends on the virtualization software and\n\n60\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.640\nsome of it like virtual box is\nwhat's called a type 2 hyperviser.\n\n61\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.450\nAnd a lot of the hardware instructions\nthat you're sending are having to be\n\n62\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.802\ntranslated into real hardware\ninstructions on the back end of that,\n\n63\n00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:00.300\nhurts performance.\n\n64\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.690\nSo if speed is your concern,\nperformance is your concern.\n\n65\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.350\nYou'll prefer dual booting\nover virtual machines.\n\n66\n00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080\nBut if you just had some software program.\n\n67\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.804\nMaybe you have a legacy line of business\napplication that you run once a month and\n\n68\n00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:13.927\nyou need this other OS.\n\n69\n00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:18.160\nA virtual machine is a better solution\nbecause it's much easier to set up.\n\n70\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.486\nIt's less invasive and you don't run\nthe risk of messing up your other OS.\n\n71\n00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:25.040\nNow, in the real world examples\nof where we might use this,\n\n72\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.994\nthe video gamers use it all the time,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:27.764\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n74\n00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:29.637\n&gt;&gt; Linux is a great operating system.\n\n75\n00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:31.807\nIt's very powerful, very stable,\n\n76\n00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:35.447\nbut most of the video games that\ncome out in the Windows world,\n\n77\n00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:39.860\nand so a lot of Linux gamers will have\na Windows OS that are set to dual boost.\n\n78\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.130\nThey could boot to Windows and\nrun their game when they're done,\n\n79\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.930\nthen they boot back over to Linux.\n\n80\n00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.110\nBut even in the business\nworld there's times like for\n\n81\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.040\nme where I need to be able\nto dual boot into Windows.\n\n82\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.092\nI have a Windows partition on my laptop\nthat I boot to because I have a video\n\n83\n00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:57.946\ncapture card at my office that I use for\nsome of my Skype interviews and\n\n84\n00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:01.019\nthat capture card doesn't\nhave a driver under Linux.\n\n85\n00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:01.919\nYou know it's very hard\n\n86\n00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.460\nto find specialized hardware\nthat works under Linux.\n\n87\n00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.270\nAnd so when I do those interviews,\nI boot to Windows, I do the interview.\n\n88\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.110\nWhen I'm done, I boot back to Linux.\n\n89\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.870\nAnd so having that little back-up that\nI can switch to takes care of that.\n\n90\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.730\nBut I usually use VMs.\n\n91\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.430\nAnd I think at this point,\n\n92\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.330\nit's probably been over a month since\nI booted in to Windows on my laptop\n\n93\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.370\nbecause the majority of what I can do\nis done right here inside of Linux.\n\n94\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.055\n&gt;&gt; So if you do dual boot, a true\ndual boot will give you heavy metal,\n\n95\n00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:28.928\nis that right?\n\n96\n00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:31.553\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It gives you that hardcore\n\n97\n00:04:31.553 --> 00:04:35.220\nperformance on your system,\nit's what a lot of people seek.\n\n98\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.873\n&gt;&gt; Well, are there any considerations or\ngotchas for setting this up?\n\n99\n00:04:38.873 --> 00:04:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\na couple of things to think about.\n\n100\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.944\nFirst off, a lot of the people that try\ndual boot the first time are doing it\n\n101\n00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:46.832\nbecause they're considering Linux.\n\n102\n00:04:46.832 --> 00:04:48.740\nBut they don't know if it's\ngonna be right for them.\n\n103\n00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.350\nSo they wanna keep their\nold OS laying around.\n\n104\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.753\nMaybe it's MacOS, maybe it's Windows.\n\n105\n00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:56.406\nSo the first gotcha we need to be aware\nof is when you're configuring dual boot,\n\n106\n00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.541\nif you do it wrong ,you\ncan lose your other OS.\n\n107\n00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:02.185\nSo if I'm trying to keep my old\noperating system as a safety net and\n\n108\n00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:06.290\njust try out Linux, dual boot might\nnot be the best solution there.\n\n109\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.530\nYou might want to use a live CD.\n\n110\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.250\nIf you go back and\n\n111\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.690\nwatch our installing Linux shows I\ntalk about those a little bit there.\n\n112\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.644\nBut a lot of the installers like\nthe Fedora install media you can run\n\n113\n00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:15.235\nas a live CD.\n\n114\n00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:17.189\nYou can boot off of the USB key.\n\n115\n00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.358\nSo it doesn't mess with your hard drive,\nwith dual booting we have to mess with\n\n116\n00:05:20.358 --> 00:05:23.350\nthe hard drive and there's always risk\nwhen you mess with the hard drive.\n\n117\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.340\nSo you're gonna need to make\nsure you back up all your data\n\n118\n00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.290\nbefore you configure dual boot or\nyou run that risk of losing information.\n\n119\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.640\nThe other thing is if you're dual\nbooting Linux you're fine but\n\n120\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.810\nif you're dual booting Windows for\nexample.\n\n121\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.550\nYou do still have to\nhave a Windows license.\n\n122\n00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.720\nSo, for example, my laptop,\n\n123\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.010\nwhen I bought my laptop,\nit came with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed.\n\n124\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.400\nWell, Ubuntu Linux is free, so\nyou know, anybody can run that.\n\n125\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.960\nBut I said, I'm dual booting Windows and\nWindows is not free.\n\n126\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.960\nSo I have to have a valid Windows\nlicense in order to install that and\n\n127\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.170\nget it up and operational.\n\n128\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.314\nIf you're just dual booting Linux you\ndon't really worry about the licensing.\n\n129\n00:06:02.314 --> 00:06:06.850\nWell even Red Hat though is\na commercial licensed operating system.\n\n130\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.200\nSo if you're running Red Hat Linux\nyou've got to worry about that license.\n\n131\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.900\nAnd they're usually licensed based\non how many installs you have.\n\n132\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.620\nNot whether they're running or not.\n\n133\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.930\nSo even though my Windows partition\nis not booted up right now\n\n134\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.060\nI do still have to have a license for it.\n\n135\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.510\nSo licensing is another gotcha\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n136\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.020\nAnd then the last one that I\nwanna mention is virtualization.\n\n137\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.831\nThere's some hardware, like if you watched\nmy older shows I used to use a Mac book\n\n138\n00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:32.198\non the show until I got\nfrustrated enough with it.\n\n139\n00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:36.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's reasons why I did that, right?\n\n140\n00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:38.634\nSo a lot of people I use\nto get emails all the time.\n\n141\n00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:39.739\nDon why are you using a Mac book?\n\n142\n00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:42.424\nIt's crazy and\nthe main reason was because of licensing.\n\n143\n00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:47.046\nThat Apple will not allow you\nto virtualize MacOS unless\n\n144\n00:06:47.046 --> 00:06:49.608\nit's running on top of MacOS.\n\n145\n00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:50.474\nThat was their rule.\n\n146\n00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:52.225\nIt had to be running on their hardware,\n\n147\n00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.610\nwith their OS in order\nto do virtualization.\n\n148\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.744\nSo I do virtualization in my shows and\nfor licensing reasons I had to do that.\n\n149\n00:06:58.744 --> 00:07:02.430\nBut there were problems,\nlike if I dual booted into Linux or if I\n\n150\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.106\ndual booted into Windows for that matter,\nit didn't really matter who it was.\n\n151\n00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:11.025\nThere were features like Intel's VTX,\nthe virtualization technologies\n\n152\n00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:15.202\nthat are built right into the processor,\nwe need that for a Type 1 Hypervisor.\n\n153\n00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:18.920\nWell, they would be turned on\nwhen I booted into MAC OS.\n\n154\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.770\nAnd they wouldn't be turned on\nwhen I booted into Windows.\n\n155\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.680\nAnd so if I boot it into Windows\nthings like hyper v wouldn't work.\n\n156\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.693\nIf I boot it into Linux things like KVM\nwouldn't see it as a type one Hyperviser\n\n157\n00:07:28.693 --> 00:07:30.933\nand they'd flip in into the type two mode.\n\n158\n00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:33.564\nStart using QEMU and\nI get poorer performance and\n\n159\n00:07:33.564 --> 00:07:37.155\nyou can't go into the BIOS on a Mac\nto adjust stuff like that, and so\n\n160\n00:07:37.155 --> 00:07:40.695\nI would start to lose features and\nthat was really challenging.\n\n161\n00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:43.905\nThat happens on some\nhardware Macs specifically.\n\n162\n00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:47.890\nBut if you've got a standard PC like\nthe one I've got in front of me.\n\n163\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.469\nThen you should be able to\ndual boot without issues.\n\n164\n00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:52.071\nThat all of your hardware should function,\n\n165\n00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.338\nall of your features should be\nthere to be taken advantage of.\n\n166\n00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:56.110\nBut it's something that you'll\nwant to keep an eye on,\n\n167\n00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.551\nyou'll want to watch out for\nthose options.\n\n168\n00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:02.052\n&gt;&gt; So I'm excited to see this happen, so\ncan we configure it and see what happens?\n\n169\n00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:03.320\nOr how to configure it?\n\n170\n00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n171\n00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.960\nSo I'm going to do this\ninside of a virtual machine.\n\n172\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.880\nAnd normally,\nI'd want to show you on bare metal.\n\n173\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.000\nWell, I mean, I've got my laptop.\n\n174\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.360\nMy laptop actually is set\nto dual-boot right now, but\n\n175\n00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.320\nI'm gonna use a virtual machine.\n\n176\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.530\nAnd the main reason is,\nwe're gonna have to reboot a few times.\n\n177\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.220\nAnd when I do that, the only way I\ncan show you guys what's going on,\n\n178\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.540\non the screen, is if I'm virtualized.\n\n179\n00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.410\nSo I'm running this in a VM.\n\n180\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.800\nAnd I've got a Windows virtual\nmachine fired up here.\n\n181\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.066\nSo this is running Windows 10.\n\n182\n00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:31.080\nNow, if you're dual-booting, we need\nto be considerate over which operating\n\n183\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.840\nsystem is installed first, and which\noperating system is installed second.\n\n184\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.540\nBecause to do dual-boot, step one, is you\nneed to get one operating system up and\n\n185\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.330\nrunning, your choice.\n\n186\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330\nWell, it's not entirely your choice.\n\n187\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.340\nIf you're gonna be\ndual-booting with Windows,\n\n188\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.045\nit's really important that\nyou install Windows first.\n\n189\n00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:53.845\nAnd not because Windows is better or\nwe like Windows or whatever, but\n\n190\n00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:57.320\nbecause Windows hates everything else.\n\n191\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n192\n00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:02.932\nif you install Windows second, guess what\nit's gonna do to the Linux Boot Loader?\n\n193\n00:09:02.932 --> 00:09:04.282\nIt's gonna wipe it out, right?\n\n194\n00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:06.012\nThat's what it does,\nWindows hates everything.\n\n195\n00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.852\nSo when you install,\n\n196\n00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:11.122\nyou need to install your least\nfriendly operating system first.\n\n197\n00:09:11.122 --> 00:09:13.402\nIf you're on a Mac,\nyou need to install Mac OS first.\n\n198\n00:09:13.402 --> 00:09:14.712\nIf you're on a Windows machine or\n\n199\n00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:18.140\na PC or you're just dual-booting Windows,\nyou need to install Windows first.\n\n200\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.784\nAll right, if you're installing Linux,\nmultiple versions of Linux, right?\n\n201\n00:09:21.784 --> 00:09:24.478\nWe had,\nI think it was Ryan in the chat-room,\n\n202\n00:09:24.478 --> 00:09:27.790\nwho was doing Red Hat Enterprise Linux and\nUbuntu.\n\n203\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.710\nOkay well that's two Linux distros right?\n\n204\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But we need to be careful there,\n\n205\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.960\nbecause there are multiple boot\nloaders supported by Linux distros\n\n206\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.870\nthat are out there.\n\n207\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:42.540\nSo for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nuses the legacy GRUB in certain versions.\n\n208\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.340\nAnd Ubuntu uses GRUB version 2,\nthe new boot loader.\n\n209\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.120\nWell if I install the newer\nboot loader first,\n\n210\n00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.290\nthe older boot loader will install second\nand blow away the new ones, that's bad.\n\n211\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.970\nSo I need to install the least\nfriendly operating system first and\n\n212\n00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.610\nusing Ryan's example,\nwe need to make sure that we install\n\n213\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.830\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux first, and\nthat would install the older boot loader.\n\n214\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.665\nAnd then we install the Ubuntu second,\nthat would upgrade us to the newer boot\n\n215\n00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:13.200\nloader that supports both, Red Hat and\nthe Ubuntu, and you'll solve that problem.\n\n216\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.030\nSo, always think about that, and\n\n217\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.910\nwhen I think about the least friendly\noperating system is Mac OS, right?\n\n218\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.480\nSo we started with that one.\n\n219\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.866\nAnd then Windows comes in second place,\nfor being the least friendly.\n\n220\n00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:25.980\nAnd after that,\nare older versions of Linux, like Red Hat,\n\n221\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.010\nthat use the older boot loaders.\n\n222\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.070\nAnd then the most friendly are the ones\nthat use the newer boot loaders,\n\n223\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.930\nthings like Ubuntu or Fedora, those guys.\n\n224\n00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.650\nSo I'm starting with Windows on this\nmachine, and when I install Windows,\n\n225\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.510\nyou just install it like\na normal Windows install,\n\n226\n00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.476\nlike it's the only thing around, right?\n\n227\n00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:47.100\nBut you need to leave room on\nthe hard drive for another OS.\n\n228\n00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.060\nSo let me show you what I've\ndone here on this machine.\n\n229\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.780\nWhen I installed Windows,\n\n230\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.210\nit asked me how much space I\nwanted to use on the hard drive.\n\n231\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.170\nAnd normally we tell it we want to\nuse the full hard drive, right?\n\n232\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.240\nBut when I do this one,\nI told it only to use half the hard drive.\n\n233\n00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.210\nSo I have a 500 gig disk.\n\n234\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.190\nAnd if I look at that 500 gig disk,\nI can see where Windows created a reserve\n\n235\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.690\npartition, and then the partition\nwhere I actually installed Windows to.\n\n236\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.250\nIt's formatted in TFS.\n\n237\n00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.595\nAnd then I've got 256 gigs of unallocated\nspace right there at the end,\n\n238\n00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:18.010\nthat I'm not using.\n\n239\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.580\nI need that empty space because that's\nwhere I'm going to be installing my second\n\n240\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.830\noperating system.\n\n241\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.170\nIf I was installing Red Hat I\nwould do the same thing.\n\n242\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.280\nIn the partitioning you\nwould leave empty space.\n\n243\n00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.640\nIf I was installing MAC OS\nyou'd leave empty space.\n\n244\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.250\nWell, funny thing there.\n\n245\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.240\nMac OS really doesn't like\nto leave empty space, so\n\n246\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.840\nit will normally format out the drive.\n\n247\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.450\nEven Windows doesn't make it obvious,\nhow you can go in and resize this stuff.\n\n248\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.080\nSo if you forget, maybe you've had\nyour computer for a year, right?\n\n249\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.820\nAnd you've been using it and\n\n250\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.050\nyou've had that whole hard drive, and\nnow you decide you wanna dual-boot.\n\n251\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.580\nMost of them do support\nresizing the partition.\n\n252\n00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.600\nSo you can come in and you can take\nan existing partition like this, and\n\n253\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.160\nyou can choose to shrink it or\nresize it, but it doesn't always work.\n\n254\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.910\nAnd the reasoning there is files,\nin theory, should all be written to\n\n255\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.090\nthe beginning of the drive and\nthe end should be empty, right?\n\n256\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.700\nBut sometimes as disks fragment and stuff,\nfiles get written all over the drive.\n\n257\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.080\nAnd you might find where you\nhave a 100 gigs of free space,\n\n258\n00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.720\nbut you can only shrink it by 20 gigs.\n\n259\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.790\nAnd that's because you've got files\nkind of scattered across the disk.\n\n260\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.670\nAnd so,\nthat's a challenge you might bump into.\n\n261\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.600\n&gt;&gt; That's an expression I\nhaven't heard in awhile, defrag.\n\n262\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.895\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I haven't heard that in awhile.\n\n263\n00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Defrag used to be a big deal,\ncuz performance.\n\n264\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.340\nOn SSDs and stuff we don't care about it\nanymore, it doesn't hurt performance, but\n\n265\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.770\nit does hurt your ability\nto resize like this.\n\n266\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.740\nSo you might need to defragment the disk,\nto move those files to the beginning or\n\n267\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.350\nworst case scenario, you might need\nto back up the disk, format it and\n\n268\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.100\nrestore the disk.\n\n269\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.140\nAnd when you restore it,\nit puts everything back to the beginning.\n\n270\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.350\nAnd now you can come in and\nyou can resize this.\n\n271\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n272\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAnother option.\n\n273\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.300\nThis would be my least preferred option.\n\n274\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.010\nIt's always best to resize a partition in\nthe native operating system, but if for\n\n275\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.950\nsome reason, I don't want to do that,\nin the Linux world you can boot off\n\n276\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.380\na Fedora Live CD, and you can use\na software utility called GParted.\n\n277\n00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.990\nGParted is a graphical\npartition editor and\n\n278\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.140\nit lets you resize those partitions too.\n\n279\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.410\nIt's not perfect, they didn't\nlicense NTFS from Microsoft, and\n\n280\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.370\nthey didn't license the Apple Journal\nfile system from Apple.\n\n281\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.810\nThey reversed engineered it.\n\n282\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.990\nAnd so, it's not perfect.\n\n283\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.570\nThat's why it's always better\nto resize in the native OS.\n\n284\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.490\nBut, once you've got that free space,\nnow we can do the install.\n\n285\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.050\nNow, I've got 256 gigs of free space here.\n\n286\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.135\nYou don't need that much.\n\n287\n00:13:30.135 --> 00:13:33.790\nYour average Linux install is\nwell beneath 20 gigs in size.\n\n288\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.390\nBut, you do need to think\nabout the applications and\n\n289\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.540\nthings you want to install.\n\n290\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.210\nRight.\n\n291\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.030\nIf I'm installing two Linux installs.\n\n292\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.340\nWell, they can both read\neach other's partitions,\n\n293\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.950\nthey're happy with that, right?\n\n294\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.440\nBut, if I have Windows,\nthat's NTFS, and I have Linux,\n\n295\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.610\nthat is ext4, or btrfs, or\nwhatever file system I choose, xfs.\n\n296\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.680\nWell, Linux only gets read access to NTFS.\n\n297\n00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.480\nBecause they reversed engineered it.\n\n298\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.930\nThey didn't license the protocol.\n\n299\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.070\nSo if they write to it,\nit can cause damage.\n\n300\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.940\nThere are plenty of instructions\nout there on the internet,\n\n301\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.000\nthat tell you how to get right access to\nNTFS partitions from inside a Linux, but\n\n302\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.230\nthey're all somewhat dangerous.\n\n303\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.360\nAnd they all have that caveat of,\nyou'll corrupt your data.\n\n304\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.740\nSo they get read access.\n\n305\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.060\nAnd Windows,\nWindows doesn't read Ext4 at all, right?\n\n306\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.588\nI use a third-party product from a company\ncalled Paragon, and they have Ext4 for\n\n307\n00:14:23.588 --> 00:14:24.340\nWindows.\n\n308\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.770\nAnd so, it allows Windows to read that.\n\n309\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.830\nBut normally, when we dual-boot like this,\n\n310\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.800\nthe operating systems will not be\nable to see each other's storage.\n\n311\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.960\nSo if I have a bunch of documents,\nI might need to keep two copies of it.\n\n312\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.520\nOr I might need to have a third partition,\nthat's formatted with something like xfat,\n\n313\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.560\nor fat32, that both operating\nsystems support, right?\n\n314\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.880\nYou may need to go that route.\n\n315\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.962\n&gt;&gt; So Don, if we had two OS's, that are\nplaying in the sandbox nicely together,\n\n316\n00:14:48.962 --> 00:14:54.100\nwhat would the perfect view, what would\nit look like, in a perfect world?\n\n317\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.630\nSo, the way I normally set it up,\nand here,\n\n318\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.680\nyou know what,\nlet me show you on my own laptop.\n\n319\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.590\nHere, we'll show you that I\npractice what I preach here.\n\n320\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.920\nSo, let's get out of this stuff.\n\n321\n00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.415\nAnd, So here's my laptop.\n\n322\n00:15:09.415 --> 00:15:13.335\nAnd I'm just gonna pull up my disks here.\n\n323\n00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:15.015\nAnd what you'll see in mine, and\n\n324\n00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:17.645\nI was very particular in how\nI specced out this laptop.\n\n325\n00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:19.275\nSo I got two hard drives in the laptop.\n\n326\n00:15:19.275 --> 00:15:20.985\nNow, I didn't need two,\nI could've done one hard drive.\n\n327\n00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:25.505\nBut I wanted an NVME disk that\ncould boot nice and fast.\n\n328\n00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:29.085\nSo I got a 500 GB NVME disk,\nthis guy right here.\n\n329\n00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:33.980\nAnd I, whoops, And I switch back to\nWindows by accident, there we go.\n\n330\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.660\nThere, so a 500 GB NVMe disk.\n\n331\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.080\nAnd if you look at my partitioning,\nit looks like it's a bit of a mess.\n\n332\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.340\nBut that's because I\ninstalled Windows first and\n\n333\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.650\nthese first couple of partitions\nare from Windows, right?\n\n334\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.060\nActually, there's some\nkind of unknown one there.\n\n335\n00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.080\nBut you'll see where I've\ngot a 262 GB NTFS disk.\n\n336\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.610\nAnd then, I installed Fedora second.\n\n337\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.881\nAnd here's Fedora,\nright in this second petition.\n\n338\n00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:57.939\nAnd it created some extra\npetitions itself, right?\n\n339\n00:15:57.939 --> 00:16:01.381\nCuz you know they have boot and we talked\nabout those in the installing episodes.\n\n340\n00:16:01.381 --> 00:16:02.912\nSo there's those two separate ones.\n\n341\n00:16:02.912 --> 00:16:06.597\nOkay, well Fedora isn't really\ngood at reading NTFS and\n\n342\n00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:12.130\nWindows isn't really good at reading EXT4,\nwhich is what I formatted that as.\n\n343\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.810\nSo because they're not able to read each\nother, they're not able to share data.\n\n344\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.780\nSo I actually have a second hard drive,\n\n345\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.890\na 1 terabyte SSD that I formatted the XT4,\nokay?\n\n346\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:23.910\nNow why did I pick the XT4?\n\n347\n00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.850\nWell, I could have done XFAT,\nbut XFAT is really\n\n348\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.510\nsusceptible to discorruption if you\nlose power, and I'm on a laptop.\n\n349\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.930\nLaptops lose power all the time.\n\n350\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.670\nDesktops, not so much, so\nmaybe it's a little more safe there.\n\n351\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:40.549\nI could have gone NTFS and used a\nwriteable method from Linux to access it,\n\n352\n00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:45.193\nbut that can cause disk corruption,\nmeanwhile EXT 4 is open source,\n\n353\n00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:46.941\nit's fully documented.\n\n354\n00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:51.428\nAnd that means we can get reliable\nconsistent access from other OS's, and so\n\n355\n00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:55.363\nI used that Paragon software,\nI think it was $15 it was not a lot of\n\n356\n00:16:55.363 --> 00:17:00.290\nmoney to install on my Windows partition,\nso that it could access this EXT 4 drive.\n\n357\n00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.760\nSo this one drive is now shared, so I put\nall of my data in this one terabyte drive.\n\n358\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.130\nAnd if I boot to Linux it's all there, and\nif I boot to windows it'is all there, and\n\n359\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.500\nI have VMware workstation\ninstalled in both.\n\n360\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.530\nI put all my VMs right\nin this partition and\n\n361\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.810\nI can run them in either OS as I need it,\nright.\n\n362\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.160\nThat is fantastic.\n\n363\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.485\n&gt;&gt; That is really kind of, I don't wanna\ncall it perfect, for me that's my example.\n\n364\n00:17:21.485 --> 00:17:23.485\nThat's what works for me and does well for\n\n365\n00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:26.295\nyou other in TV line you may\nhave other needs that I don't.\n\n366\n00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:29.011\nOr you may have a laptop that have drive,\nso\n\n367\n00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:32.932\nyou take a one terabyte drive and\nmaybe you set a 100 gigs for\n\n368\n00:17:32.932 --> 00:17:37.856\nWindows, a 100 gigs for Linux and\nthen 800 gigs for your data, right.\n\n369\n00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:41.447\nWhere you use partition now okay, you do\nwhat you can with the, the resources that\n\n370\n00:17:41.447 --> 00:17:45.570\nyou've got, so that's really the way\nthat stuff ends up working out.\n\n371\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.150\nAnd you kind of just figure\nout what meets your needs.\n\n372\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.670\n&gt;&gt; So, how do we actually,\nlike the nuts and bolts of it.\n\n373\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.020\nHow do we begin actually\ndoing the dual boot?\n\n374\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.730\n&gt;&gt; Good point, so everything we've done so\nfar is just prep work, right?\n\n375\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.810\nI've got my first OS installed which\nI just installed like normal, right?\n\n376\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.650\nNo difference.\n\n377\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.130\nI left some empty space on the drive or\nI made some empty space on way or another.\n\n378\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.280\nNow I need to install the other OS and\nso here's the tricky part.\n\n379\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.540\nSome OSs make it really easy,\nsome don't, all right.\n\n380\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.760\nSo for example, Ubuntu, Ubuntu is one of\nthe easiest to set up a dual boot with.\n\n381\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.130\nYou install your least friendly OS first,\nand then you boot off your Ubuntu disk,\n\n382\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.790\nand Ubuntu will recognize\nthat least friendly OS, and\n\n383\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.560\nallow you to install side by side.\n\n384\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.500\nSo for example, if I just close\nthis out here, I'm going to\n\n385\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.155\nmake sure that I've got a Ubuntu\ndisk in my drive, right?\n\n386\n00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:37.595\nSo let me go in here and\npull up my virtual machine's disk, and\n\n387\n00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:39.715\nmake sure that I'm set to boot to Ubuntu.\n\n388\n00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:42.814\nAnd I'm gonna boot off\nthat installable media and\n\n389\n00:18:42.814 --> 00:18:47.753\nwhen I do that, and Windows plugin to that\ncrazy thing or wants to do updates, so\n\n390\n00:18:47.753 --> 00:18:49.919\nlet me reboot the old fashion way.\n\n391\n00:18:52.594 --> 00:18:54.100\nThere we go.\n\n392\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.730\nSo what's gonna happen is\nUbuntu is gonna boot up and\n\n393\n00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.750\nnormally it would want to raise\nthe whole hard drive, and\n\n394\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.220\nblow everything out but\nwe don't want that to happen this time.\n\n395\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.350\nWell fortunately it's gonna boot up,\nit's gonna see,\n\n396\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.610\nhey, there's already a Windows boot\nloader, there's already a Windows install.\n\n397\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.540\nAnd it's going to offer us an extra\noption, an option we don't normally see.\n\n398\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.860\nWhich is to run side by side with Windows.\n\n399\n00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.975\nIt'll say, let's leave Windows alone and\nwe'll add ourselves in any empty space\n\n400\n00:19:16.975 --> 00:19:19.790\nthat we can find, assuming there's enough,\nor it'll error out, right?\n\n401\n00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.820\nSo if I boot up the installer, and\nit's gonna load without video driver, so\n\n402\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.480\nit'll be a little tiny here on the screen,\nbut basically I'm gonna boot up.\n\n403\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.180\nAnd we're gonna see that\nthe standard install screen, right.\n\n404\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.020\nSo do I want to try Ubuntu, do I want\nto install it, I wanna install it.\n\n405\n00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.080\nAnd when we go into the install,\nit's gonna ask standard questions, right?\n\n406\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.340\nI'm gonna skip downloading the updates,\nand we'll just kind of move past that.\n\n407\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.810\nAnd then it's going to see\nthat Windows partition.\n\n408\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.743\nAnd so, right here, instead of the normal\noptions, which are erase disk and\n\n409\n00:19:49.743 --> 00:19:53.269\ninstall Ubuntu, or something else\nwhere I set my own partitioning.\n\n410\n00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:58.939\nI see Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10\nright, so it recognizes that it's there,\n\n411\n00:19:58.939 --> 00:20:03.420\nand if I choose that,\nthe whole rest of the installer is normal.\n\n412\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.340\nIt's gonna go through and\ndo the normal installation, but\n\n413\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.270\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna leave\nWindows alone, and it's gonna leave\n\n414\n00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.640\nthe Windows boot files there, but it's not\ngonna leave the Windows boot loader there.\n\n415\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.280\nWhat it's gonna do is it's gonna\nmove the Windows boot loader off, or\n\n416\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.230\nif you have EFI you can\nkinda leave it where it is.\n\n417\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.670\nAnd it's gonna add the Grub2\nbootloader that Ubuntu uses.\n\n418\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.020\nAnd Grub supports Linux as well as\nWindows, Grub is very friendly.\n\n419\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.200\nAnd it will add Windows to the Grub list.\n\n420\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.860\nSo with Ubuntu, when you boot up you\nnormally get a few menu options to boot in\n\n421\n00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.120\nthat your current kernel, your previous\nkernel and then a recovery mode, right?\n\n422\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.190\nOr emergency mode, those are kind\nof your three options that show up.\n\n423\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.720\nHere we'll have a fourth option\nwhich will be our Windows.\n\n424\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.070\nYou can fire that one up and boot from it,\nso it automatically handles that,\n\n425\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.160\ndual booting with Ubuntu is super\neasy as long as you've installed your\n\n426\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.280\nleast friendly OS first,\nit'll find it and set it up right?\n\n427\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.630\nBut that's with Ubuntu, let me show you\nwith Fedora, cuz Fedora is a different\n\n428\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.710\nbeast and I'm a fan of Fedora,\nit's the one that I use so it's not that I\n\n429\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.200\ndon't how to use it, it's just that it is\na little more difficult to get it set up.\n\n430\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.130\nLet me switch my disk over here.\n\n431\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.060\nAnd we will, we'll change it out.\n\n432\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.130\nAnd get a chance to see\nthis with Fedora instead.\n\n433\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.220\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n434\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.300\nAnd then I'll reboot this machine.\n\n435\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.010\nAnd when we boot up this time,\nit's gonna be Fedora.\n\n436\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.620\nAnd when Fedora boots up,\n\n437\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.880\nit's going to recognize that\nWindows partition as well, okay?\n\n438\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.140\nExcept it doesn't have a install\nalongside kind of thing.\n\n439\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.730\nIt's just gonna come in there we\ngo it's gonna come in and try and\n\n440\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.660\ndo a normal install.\n\n441\n00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.960\nRight, so I'm gonna say start\nFedora workstation live 25, and\n\n442\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.220\nthen it's gonna fire up that installer.\n\n443\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.840\nAnd once it gets in there,\nI'm gonna move in with my install and\n\n444\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.670\nit's not gonna say anything about\ninstalling alongside Windows 10.\n\n445\n00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.540\nIt's going to act like a normal install,\n\n446\n00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.990\nand if I'm not careful I can end up\nerasing the whole disk but with Ubuntu\n\n447\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.110\nit's pretty obvious you had an option that\nerase the disk you're gonna lose data.\n\n448\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.670\nBut with Fedora, it's not very obvious\nat first glance what its about to do.\n\n449\n00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.912\nSo, we have to be a little more careful.\n\n450\n00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:13.780\nI'm gonna come in here and\nchoose to install it to hard drive.\n\n451\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.330\nAnd then when I do that, it's going to\nask me, you know the standard page,\n\n452\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.420\nthat comes up with some options,\nwell, after my language here.\n\n453\n00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.450\nThe standard page that comes up that lets\nme pick where I'm gonna install too.\n\n454\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.262\nAnd right now, it's just saying\nautomatic partitioning is selected.\n\n455\n00:22:28.262 --> 00:22:32.410\nIt doesn't mention anything\nabout Windows or other OSs.\n\n456\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.100\nAnd if I click on that,\nI can see it has my hard drive selected,\n\n457\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.880\nagain, not mentioning anything\nabout the previous OS.\n\n458\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.390\nLooking down here, automatically\nconfigure partitioning is checked.\n\n459\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.250\nWhat's it gonna automatically do?\n\n460\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.120\nIs it gonna automatically wipe the drive?\n\n461\n00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.150\nI don't know, not every installer\nout there is very friendly.\n\n462\n00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:54.590\nAnd so this one in particular,\nis not really giving me any hints.\n\n463\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.090\nSo if your installer is like this and\nyou're wanting to do a boot,\n\n464\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.680\nit's really important that you choose\nto manually configure partitioning, by\n\n465\n00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.450\nmanually configuring it, you can make sure\nthat you preserve the previous OS, right?\n\n466\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.850\nSo I'm gonna choose that I will configure\npartitioning and I'll hit Done.\n\n467\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.100\nAnd on the next screen,\n\n468\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.710\nnow I get my first hint that it\nknows there's something else there.\n\n469\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.130\nBut it doesn't say, hey,\nI found Windows 10.\n\n470\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.265\nIt just says Unknown.\n\n471\n00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:23.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some some unknown thing, if\n\n472\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.970\nit was a Linux sister would actually say\nunknown Linux but here just says unknown.\n\n473\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.560\n&gt;&gt; So, Fedora is fickle?\n\n474\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a good word to use where it\nreally likes things to be done its way,\n\n475\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.440\nand remember fedora is the cutting\nedge of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n476\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.030\nSo, imagine how much\nmore fickle Red Hat is.\n\n477\n00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.499\nThat's why I say it's least\nfriendly install at first, right?\n\n478\n00:23:42.499 --> 00:23:43.923\nSo you're saying unknown,\n\n479\n00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:47.720\nif I expand it out it does recognize\nthere's a NTFS partition there right and\n\n480\n00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.639\nit's showing that 500 meg reserve\npartition that Windows created and then\n\n481\n00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:56.001\na 255 gig one which is where Windows is\nactually installed, so it's seeing those.\n\n482\n00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:59.612\nNow, that's important\nbecause by seeing them.\n\n483\n00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:01.997\nThat lets me know that it's ignoring them.\n\n484\n00:24:01.997 --> 00:24:03.216\nThat I'm not overwriting them.\n\n485\n00:24:03.216 --> 00:24:06.786\nThat it is aware that while I\nhave 512 gigs of total space,\n\n486\n00:24:06.786 --> 00:24:09.530\nI've got 256 gigs of available space.\n\n487\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.970\nSo it's not gonna mess\nwith what's there already.\n\n488\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.680\nNow, I can choose to have it\nautomatically partition, and\n\n489\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.420\nthis time I'll actually\nsee what will happen.\n\n490\n00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.950\nSo I'm not gonna do LVM, I'm just gonna\ntell it to do standard partitioning.\n\n491\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.920\nAnd I'll tell it to create automatically.\n\n492\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.040\nAnd when I do that, here's the Linux\npartitions that it just laid out.\n\n493\n00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.995\n200 gigs for /home.\n\n494\n00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:33.570\nBoot is a gig.\n\n495\n00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.460\n50 gigs for root.\n\n496\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.900\nAnd then 4 gigs for swap.\n\n497\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.750\nAnd then I still have my\nunknown partitions right there.\n\n498\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.350\nThat's the key thing.\n\n499\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.110\nYou want to keep an eye out for\nthose partitions and\n\n500\n00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.240\nmake sure they don't get wiped out.\n\n501\n00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.040\nAs long as those partitions are still\nthere, we'll be able to recover and\n\n502\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.420\nget back to our old ones one way or\nanother.\n\n503\n00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.780\nNow you might not be happy with\nthis automatic partitioning.\n\n504\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.410\nI'm not in particular, well I don't know.\n\n505\n00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.480\nYou got 200 gigs applied to home which\nis probably fine unless you store files\n\n506\n00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.510\noutside of home.\n\n507\n00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.170\nSo you can always tweak and change\nthis based on how you need it to be.\n\n508\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.840\nYou can increase sizes or decrease.\n\n509\n00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.700\nI'll leave them at default here for now.\n\n510\n00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.910\nBut once we've got that you can go and\nhit done and\n\n511\n00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.750\nnow it knows how you want to partition\nthe disk, how you want to lay that out.\n\n512\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.220\nAnd mine is thinking for a second.\n\n513\n00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.090\nHere we go.\n\n514\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.660\nAnd this is also important.\n\n515\n00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.850\nWhen you look at this list,\n\n516\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.760\nhere it is showing me all of\nthe things it is going to change.\n\n517\n00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.190\nNow, notice how everything\nover here is create device,\n\n518\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.470\ncreate device, create format.\n\n519\n00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.310\nI do not see anything that is red.\n\n520\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.180\nIf there is deletes or modifies,\nthey will show up in red.\n\n521\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.410\nAnd if I'm worried about losing my old OS,\nit would show up here in red.\n\n522\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.360\nAnd so I'm lucky that I\ndon't have any of that, and\n\n523\n00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.950\neverything here looks pretty good as\nfar as creating those partitions.\n\n524\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.350\n&gt;&gt; If you did have something in red,\ncould you restore it.\n\n525\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.405\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you had a backup.\n\n526\n00:25:45.405 --> 00:25:46.920\n[LAUGH] And here,\n\n527\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.220\nthis is like that last moment, where it\nhasn't actually changed anything yet.\n\n528\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.370\nSo if something shows up in red, and\n\n529\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.430\nit's not what you want, you get Cancel\n&amp; Return to Custom Partitioning.\n\n530\n00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.110\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; And you fix it, right?\n\n531\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.430\nBut if everything is the way that\nyou expect it, cuz maybe you did\n\n532\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.300\nresize some partitions or you removed a\npartition to make room, then that's fine.\n\n533\n00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.830\nWhen it's gonna be read,\nyou expect that, right?\n\n534\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.560\nThat here's your last chance.\n\n535\n00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.280\nAnd I'm gonna hit the Accept Changes\nbutton down here.\n\n536\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.620\nAnd when I accept that, now it's ready to\nsay I'm gonna partition out that disc and\n\n537\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.900\nlay these file systems out there.\n\n538\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.210\nNow, one thing that it didn't\nmention here on my screen,\n\n539\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:23.890\nwhen I installed Windows I must have\ndone it in legacy mode and not EFI mode.\n\n540\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:31.910\nIf it were EFI mode, it would ask me do I\nwant to overwrite the master boot record.\n\n541\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.420\nOr do I want to add another\nentry to the EFI boot menu.\n\n542\n00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.160\nCuz EFI can actually manage\noperating systems on its own.\n\n543\n00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.320\nSo, I'm not seeing that option here.\n\n544\n00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.990\nIf you're running EFI,\nyou want to add it to the EFI boot menu.\n\n545\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.130\nSo that's what you normally want to do.\n\n546\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.540\nIn a master boot record\nenvironment though,\n\n547\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.130\nyou're gonna overwrite\nthat master boot record.\n\n548\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.270\nThat's all I have, so it didn't prompt me\non that one, and it's setting it up here.\n\n549\n00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.180\nAnother thing worth\nmentioning before I move on\n\n550\n00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.050\nis if your Windows partition is\nencrypted that's not a problem,\n\n551\n00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.780\nyou'll actually have an extra pertition\nin the list so that still works too.\n\n552\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.760\nIf you've used like BitLocker or\non a Mac, if you've used File Vault,\n\n553\n00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.910\nthose don't actually encrypt the entire\ndisk, they encrypt the entire partition.\n\n554\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.360\nSo the Linux system will just\nhave another partition and\n\n555\n00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.970\nit won't be able to see the encrypted\npartition, so that works here too.\n\n556\n00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.690\nBut once that's done you can choose\nto begin the installation and\n\n557\n00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.490\nit's gonna churn forward with getting\nus set up to be able to dual boot.\n\n558\n00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.380\nAnd when that's all done I'll now have\n\n559\n00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.840\ntwo operating systems\ninstalled to my hardrive.\n\n560\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.220\nNow, the Windows bootloader is\nnot gonna be happy about that but\n\n561\n00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.110\nI'm not worried about that because the\nWindows bootloader is getting replaced.\n\n562\n00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:39.470\nIt's gonna replace with GRUB2 and GRUB2 is\nperfectly happy with more than one OS so\n\n563\n00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.820\nwhen you boot up it'll give you list.\n\n564\n00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.650\nAnd there will be a list with each of\nyour Linux distros that it can fire up,\n\n565\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.950\nthat you've installed.\n\n566\n00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.240\nAnd then if you have Windows installed,\n\n567\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.580\nit'll actually be able to\ncall the Windows boot loader.\n\n568\n00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.560\nAnd so Windows will show up as\nanother entry that you can call and\n\n569\n00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.000\nthen it'll boot and you'll go into Windows\nand Windows will think it's the only OS.\n\n570\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.250\nIt won't realize that this other\nOS is kind of hidden away.\n\n571\n00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.520\nNow I wanna show you guys what that\nlooks like when we finish the install.\n\n572\n00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.760\nBut this install is actually\ngonna take a little while.\n\n573\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.570\nAnd I know I'm low on\ntime on this episode.\n\n574\n00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.410\nSo Zach, why don't we split\noff to a part two on this one?\n\n575\n00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.520\n&gt;&gt; Part two, mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And in that way,\n\n576\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.410\nwe can let this install\nkinda do its thing or\n\n577\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.360\nperhaps I can probably just fire up\non my own laptop and show you guys.\n\n578\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.880\nBut we can walk through that process and\n\n579\n00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.800\nget an example of how dual booting\nactually functions and some of the other\n\n580\n00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.210\nmore advanced features that we might\nbump into as we work with dual booting.\n\n581\n00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Don, great information as usual,\none more thing you want to leave us with?\n\n582\n00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.730\n&gt;&gt; Main thing here is do a backup.\n\n583\n00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.560\nI know it's one of those redundant things\nthat everybody tries to drill into your\n\n584\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.840\nmind, but when you're dual booting,\nwhen you're getting it set up,\n\n585\n00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.400\nit is really easy to accidentally wipe\nout your partition or make it where you\n\n586\n00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.040\ncan't boot to your old OS or\nmake it where you can't boot to either OS.\n\n587\n00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.330\nSo having a backup and a method to be able\nto restore it is really, really handy.\n\n588\n00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.139\nAt least have a USB key with a live\ndistribution on it that you can boot-up\n\n589\n00:28:52.139 --> 00:28:54.650\noff the run so you could fix your\ncomputer if something goes wrong.\n\n590\n00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Don.\n\n591\n00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.740\nI'm becoming a Linux system administrator.\n\n592\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.910\nThere's a lot of video content\nrather in the series, so\n\n593\n00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.860\nmake sure you check them all out.\n\n594\n00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.240\nAnd we'll be back with part\ntwo of dual booting very soon.\n\n595\n00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.260\nHey, thank you for watching ITProTV and\nremember, and IT

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.830\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.740\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.899\nAs we continue one with becoming\na Linux System Administrator and\n\n9\n00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.842\ntoday we're gonna learn about\nmanaging software with apps.\n\n10\n00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.845\nAnd the person bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n11\n00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:32.049\nonly Don Pezet, Don,\nthank you for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.428\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for coming back, Zack.\n\n13\n00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:36.489\nI'm excited to dive into this one\nbecause we're gonna be driving our\n\n14\n00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.234\nmicrophone guys Crazy because\nwe're going to say apt over and\n\n15\n00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:41.360\nover again has as many posters as we can.\n\n16\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.342\nSo I apologize that in advance but\nthat is the utility were to look at.\n\n17\n00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:49.549\nIf you're not familiar with apt it\nis the software management utility\n\n18\n00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.983\nthat is found in any Debian based\noperating system so like Ubuntu, Mint.\n\n19\n00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:57.949\nYou know that the whole gigantic list\nof everything is based off of Debian\n\n20\n00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.874\nuses this utility and\nit's very similar to the DNF and\n\n21\n00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:03.683\nyoung utilities that you\nfind in the RedHat world.\n\n22\n00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:05.867\nBut App does things\na little bit differently,\n\n23\n00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.650\nsomethings people feel does better,\nsomething which people does worse.\n\n24\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.480\nBut if you need to be in this\nworld doesn't really matter,\n\n25\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.400\nthis is the tool you're going to use and\nso\n\n26\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.800\nwe're gonna see how to use it right\nhere and kind of run through its spaces.\n\n27\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.830\n&gt;&gt; So why do you need utility like app?\n\n28\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.700\n&gt;&gt; A good question, right,\n\n29\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.730\nso let's start with the basics on this\none, Apt lets us get software installed.\n\n30\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.380\nWell, I can install software\nwithout a crazy utility, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.490\nYou can just go and\ncopy the software to the right places, but\n\n32\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.190\nthat's part of the problem,\nwhere are those right places?\n\n33\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.310\nI don't know, well,\nsometimes I know, sometimes I don't.\n\n34\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.910\nDevelopers can do weird things.\n\n35\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.460\nSo a long time ago they made the decision\nto start packaging applications\n\n36\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.900\nin what were called a deb packages,\nfiles that end in dot dab, and\n\n37\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.590\na dab package has everything you\nneed to run an application and\n\n38\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.730\nit has a manifest that tells\nexactly where the files need to go.\n\n39\n00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.550\nAre the files going in /user/sbin,\nor their files going in /var,\n\n40\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.810\nor their files going here or there, what\nlibraries are being linked to this net?\n\n41\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.520\nIt keeps track of all that so\nwe don't have to have it.\n\n42\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.240\nWell, even then I can install a deb file\n\n43\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.150\nusing dpkg or\none of the other command line utilities.\n\n44\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.610\nI don't need a heavy\nutility like apt to do it.\n\n45\n00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.920\nBut where apt really soars\nis tracking dependencies.\n\n46\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.690\nDependencies are a real\nchallenge with software.\n\n47\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.860\nYou might install one program and it\nrequires the Java runtime environment 1.8,\n\n48\n00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.200\nand you install another\nsoftware package and\n\n49\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.880\nit requires the Java\nruntime environment 1.7.\n\n50\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.220\nWell, which JRE are you running?\n\n51\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.200\nYou may not be running one at all, and\nif you're not app will take care of that,\n\n52\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.790\nit will get installed and fixed for you.\n\n53\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.390\nIf you need more than one version,\nif you need different library files or\n\n54\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.220\nif you need other applications.\n\n55\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.940\nTracking all those dependencies is\na nightmare, it's really really tough and\n\n56\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.710\nso Apt is designed to handle just that.\n\n57\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.390\nSo while we certainly could get by without\napps, there's utilities like DPKG and\n\n58\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.310\nthose other guys that we can use,\n\n59\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.180\nwe're going to find that Apt is\nthe one that you want to use.\n\n60\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.580\nIt's the one that's gonna give\nyou the best handling of updates,\n\n61\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.930\nthe best handling of installing and\n\n62\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.100\nremoving applications, and just being\nable to work with software in general.\n\n63\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.510\nThis is the way we wanna go.\n\n64\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.630\n&gt;&gt; So software and dependencies and\n\n65\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.360\nso forth, but\nwhere does all the software come from?\n\n66\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Apt in and of itself,\nit has to maintain a database.\n\n67\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.210\nA database of software, right?\n\n68\n00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.060\nAll the different software that's\navailable to install on all the different\n\n69\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.040\ndependencies.\n\n70\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.200\nBut that information has\nto come from somewhere.\n\n71\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.010\nAnd for the most part that information\ncomes from, well Debian, or Ubuntu or\n\n72\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.380\nwhoever it is that made\nyour distribution right?\n\n73\n00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.060\nSo for example, if I go to my laptop and\n\n74\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.750\nI want to install something like the Links\nweb browser, right, Links is a command\n\n75\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.890\nline web browser that I don't think\nI have installed, let's see if we do.\n\n76\n00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.070\nSo if I just try and fire up Links,\nyeah so I don't have it installed.\n\n77\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.714\nAnd I wanna get it installed, I can\njust say apt get install links, right?\n\n78\n00:03:57.714 --> 00:04:00.273\nNow, I need to be an administrator,\nso let me sudo that really quick.\n\n79\n00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:04.230\nSo, I'm gonna sudo app -get install links.\n\n80\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.060\nNow, you'll see a lot of textbooks and\nother applications,\n\n81\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.780\nor you know the websites and\nstuff where they just do apps instead.\n\n82\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.610\nAnd you can do that.\n\n83\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.060\nMost systems do have apt alias to run\nthis, but it is actually app-get.\n\n84\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.020\nSo I'll go into app-get install links,\nand it reaches out and it finds it.\n\n85\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.298\nHere's the links, right?\n\n86\n00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:26.130\nIt found links-common that\nwe need to be installed but\n\n87\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.520\nit actually links the application and\nlinked-common.\n\n88\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.940\nIt found the program I wanted and\na dependency, right,\n\n89\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.270\nthat I may not have known about.\n\n90\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.810\nAnd it's gonna make sure\nthat gets installed.\n\n91\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.810\nNow, how did it know about that?\n\n92\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.500\nWhere did it find it?\n\n93\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.520\nI mentioned there has to be a database,\nwhere did all that come from?\n\n94\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.400\nWell when I go to install it we\nstart to see our first hint.\n\n95\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.090\nSee this get 1,\n\n96\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.060\nhttp us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu\nzenial/universe, blah, blah, blah.\n\n97\n00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.540\nI mean, it just goes on and on.\n\n98\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.840\nBut this is showing me where I'm\ngetting this from Ubuntu.com.\n\n99\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.540\nAll right, if you actually wanna\nsee where it's really coming from,\n\n100\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.750\nif you go into /etc/apt Inside of there,\n\n101\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.420\nthere's a file called\nsources dot list all right.\n\n102\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.390\nAnd the sources of your software can be\nlisted right in there in sources do list,\n\n103\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.480\nin this one file right here.\n\n104\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.630\nOr they can be listed in separate files\nfound inside of sources dot list dot d\n\n105\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.620\nthat folder right there, I believe that's\nempty by default let's find out and\n\n106\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.750\nyeah that's empty by default so everything\nright now and when I mean I'm using.\n\n107\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.135\nI want to back up just a second here.\n\n108\n00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:37.430\nThis is fresh and\nclean insula of a bluetooth 17.04.\n\n109\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.222\nSo, depending on when you watch this show,\n\n110\n00:05:40.222 --> 00:05:43.700\nat this moment 17.04 is the latest and\ngreatest.\n\n111\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.660\nThis is the newest OS from the bluetooth,\n\n112\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.570\nso by the time you watch this\nit might be a lot of data.\n\n113\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.770\nBut you'll find these commands don't\nreally change, it's all gonna be the same.\n\n114\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.220\nIn fact if you're using 16.10 or 16.04 or\neven the 14.04, all of this is identical.\n\n115\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.680\nThis has not changed in a long time and\nit's not gonna change anytime soon.\n\n116\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.897\nBut if I take a look at /etc/apt and\n\n117\n00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:11.280\nlook at that sources.list file,\nI'm going to find the defaults.\n\n118\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.420\nWhere it gets information by default.\n\n119\n00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.570\nAnd be careful looking at this\nfile because of a lot of what's in\n\n120\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.730\nyour guys little pound\nsymbol at the beginning.\n\n121\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.160\nEach line that has a pound\nsymbol gets ignored.\n\n122\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.750\nSo only the lines that don't have\npound symbols actually get looked at.\n\n123\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.290\nSo heres the first one that\ndoesn't have a pound symbol.\n\n124\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.830\nAnd you'll see it's\nus.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, right?\n\n125\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.270\nThat's where I saw that get one line\nwhen I was doing the install of Links.\n\n126\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.068\nAnd then down a little bit further,\nhere's another one, which is\n\n127\n00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:44.890\nus.archive.ubuntu.com/zenialupdates, all\nright.\n\n128\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.050\nThe one up here said Xenial, right?\n\n129\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.890\nBecause that's the nickname or\ncode name or whatever for 17.04, so\n\n130\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.520\nthat's the main repository for it.\n\n131\n00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.110\nAnd then this one is the updates, right?\n\n132\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.920\nNot full applications, but update\npackages which are usually a lot smaller.\n\n133\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.050\nAnd so it's looking at those two places.\n\n134\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.990\nAs we keep looking down we'll\nfind there's other ones.\n\n135\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.090\nHere's another one, down here.\n\n136\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.920\nAnd this one is entirely\nunsupported software, this is third\n\n137\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.630\nparty software that Ubuntu is hosting for\nus but they're not providing support.\n\n138\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.270\nThey support the two things up above but\nnot this one.\n\n139\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.970\nAnd so as you look at your sources.list\nyou may find other things like that, other\n\n140\n00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.420\nareas where they're completely supported,\nor not supported, or here's source code.\n\n141\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.460\nSo if I wanna pull down Debian\nsource code we can get that.\n\n142\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.760\nOr the Ubuntu source code,\nit's all published right in there and\n\n143\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.410\nyou can pull that information down.\n\n144\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.700\nBut as you work with Ubuntu over time,\n\n145\n00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.540\nyou'll find you might add other\nrepositories to the list.\n\n146\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.440\nSo what I'm showing you\nhere is the default.\n\n147\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.540\nThis is what you can expect\nto see on every Ubuntu system\n\n148\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.500\nuntil somebody comes in and modifies it.\n\n149\n00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.278\nBut this is where we're\ngetting the software from.\n\n150\n00:07:51.278 --> 00:07:56.612\nAnd AppGet is reaching out there and\nbasically pulling down a database,\n\n151\n00:07:56.612 --> 00:08:00.641\na cache of all of that software\nthat it can then look at.\n\n152\n00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:03.810\nAnd that has to be updated from\ntime to time, that database.\n\n153\n00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.787\nAnd if ever you wanna\nupdate that database,\n\n154\n00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:10.290\nall you do is you say apt-get update,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.850\nThat doesn't update your software.\n\n156\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.010\nThat doesn't actually change any\nof the software on your system or\n\n157\n00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.700\nyour operating system.\n\n158\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.300\nWell, it just updates apps database, apps\ndatabase of what software is available.\n\n159\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.200\nSo when I ran that its gonna reach\nout to each repository in that list.\n\n160\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.830\nSo each one of these corresponds to\none of the repositories in that list.\n\n161\n00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.730\nAnd then it pulls down a list of all of\ntheir software and their dependencies and\n\n162\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.610\nhow everything is linked together and\nit stores it in database.\n\n163\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.050\nAnd the database is not very big,\n\n164\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.740\nI mean, if you look at how much I had to\nretrieve here, I pulled out a whopping,\n\n165\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.510\nalmost two and a half megabytes of data,\nso not a whole lot of information.\n\n166\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.220\nBut, now I've got an up to date\ndatabase and if I wanna go and\n\n167\n00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.170\nstart installing software,\nI'm ready to do that.\n\n168\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.580\nSo, that's where all this software\nis coming from, at least.\n\n169\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.940\nBy default that's where\nthis offer is coming from.\n\n170\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.560\n&gt;&gt; So you've upgraded\nthe OS that's great but and\n\n171\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.000\nyou just mentioned this a second ago\nabout what the third party software.\n\n172\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.385\n&gt;&gt; Right so let's back up just a hair\nbecause you said I upgraded the OS right?\n\n173\n00:09:06.385 --> 00:09:07.755\nI didn't actually upgrade the OS.\n\n174\n00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:10.615\nI just updated the database, and\nit's really easy to confuse that.\n\n175\n00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:13.095\nAnd let me show you guys,\ncuz the commands are very, very similar.\n\n176\n00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm confused.\n\n177\n00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.645\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I've been in the same boat.\n\n178\n00:09:16.645 --> 00:09:20.485\nWhen I first started learning to be in,\nand, well we didn't have apt originally.\n\n179\n00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:23.345\nBut when apt first came out I\ngot really confused on this.\n\n180\n00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:27.625\nBecause when you see me run\na command like sudu apt get update.\n\n181\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.710\nI'm updating my system, right?\n\n182\n00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.030\nBut I'm not, I'm just updating\nthe database of software.\n\n183\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.500\nI haven't updated anything.\n\n184\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.385\nIf I actually want to update my software,\nand it's not called updating,\n\n185\n00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:39.660\nit's called upgrading.\n\n186\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna upgrade my software.\n\n187\n00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.630\nAnd if I run sudo apt-get upgrade,\n\n188\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.110\nthat's what's actually\ngoing to apply the updates.\n\n189\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.420\nSo when a security update comes out or\na new version of software comes out,\n\n190\n00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:59.230\nI run that sudo apt-get upgrade and now\nit's actually looking at a data base and\n\n191\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.480\nsaying, did any of the servers have newer\nversions than the stuff I have locally?\n\n192\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.210\nAnd in my case 23 of them said yes.\n\n193\n00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.810\nAnother 23 packages that\nhave been upgraded and\n\n194\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.630\nI need to get those installed.\n\n195\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.700\nNow 23 sounds like a lot but\nlet's pack is a very small so\n\n196\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.320\nthis is not really huge deal.\n\n197\n00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.540\nI can say yes to that and now it's\nactually going through and upgrading.\n\n198\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.680\nNow even here though, going back to Zack's\nquestion about you upgrading the OS.\n\n199\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.570\nWell tactically I'm upgrading my software.\n\n200\n00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.110\nAnd there's things like the kernel\nthat won't get upgraded here.\n\n201\n00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.890\nThen if I want to upgrade the kernel I\nneed to run a slightly different command,\n\n202\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.746\nwhich is apt-get distribution upgrade.\n\n203\n00:10:38.746 --> 00:10:42.180\nIn other words,\nI'm upgrading my distribution.\n\n204\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.640\nAnd when I run that now it's gonna look.\n\n205\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.430\nAnd see how it found even more\nupdates even though I just did mine?\n\n206\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.130\nBut look at the updates,\nthe Linux kernel headers and\n\n207\n00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.890\nthe Linux image where the kernel\nis actually stored now and\n\n208\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.270\nactually upgrading\nthe operating system itself.\n\n209\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.740\nSo we've got three commands that\nare really similar and easy to confuse.\n\n210\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.210\nSo let's run over in here real\nquick just so we remember.\n\n211\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.260\nApp dash get update on the updates\nare software database.\n\n212\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.130\nSo the software we know about.\n\n213\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.450\nIt doesn't actually change the software,\njust the software we know about.\n\n214\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:18.360\nAnd then app-get upgrade, that's what\nactually upgrades all of our software but\n\n215\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.340\nno the kernel, not the core,\nthe heart of the OS.\n\n216\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.740\nUnless its like an emergency\nsecurity update.\n\n217\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.740\nAnd then there is apt dash\nget disk dash upgrade\n\n218\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.350\nthat actually upgrades the current\nof the core to the OS.\n\n219\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.930\nAnd so really we find that we run these\nthree commands pretty frequently.\n\n220\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.340\nSo if I'm about to upgrade a system,\n\n221\n00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.030\nif I do a fresh install\nof Ubuntu like this one.\n\n222\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:46.550\nOne of the first things that I do is\napt get update, to update the database.\n\n223\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.170\nApt get upgrade to upgrade\nthe pre-installed software.\n\n224\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.090\nAnd then apt get dist upgrade\nto upgrade the kernel.\n\n225\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.410\nAnd after a dist upgrade\nyou need to reboot, right?\n\n226\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.630\nCuz the kernels don't update\nuntil after you reboot.\n\n227\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:02.010\nSo once it reboots, now the new kernel\nis in place and you're fully upgraded.\n\n228\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.590\nSo three different commands\nthere to do the update.\n\n229\n00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.490\nBut going back, again,\neven a little further to Zack's question,\n\n230\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.270\nhe was saying,\nwhat about third party software?\n\n231\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you'd mentioned that earlier,\nI was wondering.\n\n232\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.840\n&gt;&gt; And nothing I've done so\nfar has really been third party.\n\n233\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.890\nEverything has been\nstraight up from Ubuntu.\n\n234\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.500\nWell, Canonical,\nthe company that makes Ubuntu,\n\n235\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.520\nthey didn't write all the software.\n\n236\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.490\nThey didn't write the Linux kernel,\nright, somebody else did.\n\n237\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.918\nSo in a way there is third\nparty software here.\n\n238\n00:12:25.918 --> 00:12:29.890\nBut it's third-party software that's\nbeing supported by Canonical.\n\n239\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.580\nAnd what you'll find is that,\nin real life land, that's great.\n\n240\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.250\nThey have a nice,\nbig selection of software you can install.\n\n241\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.500\nBut there's always going to\nbe something that's missing,\n\n242\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.430\nsome piece that you need installed\nthat another company makes and\n\n243\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.020\nCanonical just doesn't\nhave in their library.\n\n244\n00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.912\nSo we need to go out and get it,\nget it installed, and use it.\n\n245\n00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:50.632\nSo we can modify this whole process.\n\n246\n00:12:50.632 --> 00:12:55.221\nWe can change it to support sources\nother than the default distribution.\n\n247\n00:12:55.221 --> 00:12:59.019\nAnd I keep singling out Ubuntu because\nthey're really the most popular of these\n\n248\n00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:01.965\ndistros but it's the same on Debian,\nit's the same on Mint,\n\n249\n00:13:01.965 --> 00:13:06.180\nthey've all got repositories that are all\ntied in all through the apt utility.\n\n250\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.982\nSo it's the same basic thing.\n\n251\n00:13:07.982 --> 00:13:10.564\nSo let me give you an example of\na third-party software package that you\n\n252\n00:13:10.564 --> 00:13:11.433\nmight want to install.\n\n253\n00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:16.977\nSo, there are, my updates have finished\njust for the record [LAUGH], there's\n\n254\n00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:22.281\na third-party package called Webmin and\nI used to use Webmin all the time.\n\n255\n00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:27.174\nI use a different product called Cockpit\nnow, but Webmin gives you a web-based\n\n256\n00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:31.820\nkind of a GUI, a graphical user\ninterface for managing your server.\n\n257\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.280\nSo if you have a Linux system\nyou can browse to this web page.\n\n258\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.720\nYou can actually see what's going on\nin your system and do updates and\n\n259\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.910\nother things all via our web page.\n\n260\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.180\nIt's kinda nice.\n\n261\n00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.500\nBut it's not in the standard\nrepositories right.\n\n262\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.360\nIf I were to go on and try to install this\nand do something like app get install\n\n263\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.580\nWebmin and go to look for it, unable to\nlocate package right, so it's not there.\n\n264\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.610\nWell I can go to Webmin's website and\nI can go to their downloads page, and\n\n265\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.000\non their downloads page they have\na Debian package right there.\n\n266\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.720\nSuitable for Debian, Ubuntu or other\nderived Linux so that includes Mint and\n\n267\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.280\nI could download the DEB file and\nI could install it.\n\n268\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.370\nAll right, but when I do that,\nit's just a straight up DEB file, and\n\n269\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.960\nso there's gonna be two problems.\n\n270\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.630\nProblem one is it's really hard to\ntrack dependencies when you just have\n\n271\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.590\nthe DEB package and that's it.\n\n272\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.460\nYou can do some, but it's not perfect.\n\n273\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.320\nAll right, problem number two,\nit's not gonna automatically update.\n\n274\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.330\nEvery time a new version of Webmin comes\nout, I have to go an download the new DEB\n\n275\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.230\nand apply it, right, so\nI've got to do that update by hand.\n\n276\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.850\nSo what a lot of third parties will do\nis stand up their own repository, and\n\n277\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.870\nthe people at Webmin have done that.\n\n278\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.040\nYeah, they've got their standard\ninstalling, configuration commands here,\n\n279\n00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.720\nright, so they can use dpkg to\ninstall that dev if you want.\n\n280\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.490\nBut if you scroll down a little bit more,\nyou'll see, whoops, scrolled down a little\n\n281\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:53.400\ntoo much, where they actually\nhave a Webmin apps repository.\n\n282\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.380\nSo I can actually use their repository and\nnow I can easily\n\n283\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:04.140\ninstall tracking dependencies and we can\nautomatically update with app right.\n\n284\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.910\nAnd let me just show you how that works.\n\n285\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:14.170\nThey're showing us first, downloading and\nupdating the /etc/apt/sources.list file.\n\n286\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:19.300\nIn order for us to find this repository,\nwe've got to put it in sources.list,\n\n287\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.230\nand that's that file that I was\nshowing you guys earlier, right here.\n\n288\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.050\nThe sources.list file.\n\n289\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.150\nAnd if I edit that Sudo because you do\nneed to be an administrator to do this.\n\n290\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.130\nSo I'll go in there.\n\n291\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.750\nWe can see the repositories, they're\nactually kind of lit up this way, so\n\n292\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.690\nyou can see exactly which\nones are turned on.\n\n293\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.550\nAnd each one is ubunto.com, right.\n\n294\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.790\nSo there's six of them by default and\nthey're all ubunto.com.\n\n295\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.660\nI'm gonna come down here to the end and\nI'm gonna add another line.\n\n296\n00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.930\nAnd I'll just say this is\nthe webmin repository.\n\n297\n00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.262\nAnd I'm gonna add one more entry.\n\n298\n00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:56.960\nNow if I go back to their webpage,\nthey're telling me the entry right here.\n\n299\n00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:03.134\nAnd instead of pointing to Canonical,\nThis one is pointing to them.\n\n300\n00:16:03.134 --> 00:16:08.189\nIt's pointing to\ndownload.webmin.com/download/repository,\n\n301\n00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:10.720\nand notice how this one says sarge.\n\n302\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.465\nAll the other one said zineal.\n\n303\n00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:15.482\nSarge is an earlier version of Ubuntu.\n\n304\n00:16:15.482 --> 00:16:17.037\nNow, that's not a big deal.\n\n305\n00:16:17.037 --> 00:16:19.523\nI'm not too worried about if\nit doesn't land or actually,\n\n306\n00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:21.226\nsarge is an older version of the Debian.\n\n307\n00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:24.388\nSo Debian sarge was a very stable\nlong term support version so\n\n308\n00:16:24.388 --> 00:16:26.688\nmost people write their software for that.\n\n309\n00:16:26.688 --> 00:16:30.685\nThat doesn't mean it's not compatible with\nUbuntu, or Zenial, or whatever and in fact\n\n310\n00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:34.360\nthey've tested it on that, but you do need\nto double check that with the vendors to\n\n311\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.961\nmake sure they support your version of\nthe distribution that you're running.\n\n312\n00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:42.194\nBut by adding this repository,\nnow when I run pseudo app get update and\n\n313\n00:16:42.194 --> 00:16:44.131\nit goes to update the database,\n\n314\n00:16:44.131 --> 00:16:48.760\nit's gonna pull the information from\nthis repository as well, all right.\n\n315\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.380\nIt's gonna get that information loaded and\n\n316\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.950\nnow I'll see packages from\nthis third party location.\n\n317\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.280\nNow, technically that's all I needed\nto do, was to add that to the list,\n\n318\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.910\nbut you'll see where they've gone one\nstep further here with the security key.\n\n319\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.518\nOkay, so what's that all about?\n\n320\n00:17:05.518 --> 00:17:10.063\nWhen you pull software from a third party\nrepository, you really need to trust them.\n\n321\n00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:13.584\nYou're trusting who it is that\nyou're getting that software from,\n\n322\n00:17:13.584 --> 00:17:16.376\nbecause what if hackers break\ninto that repository and\n\n323\n00:17:16.376 --> 00:17:20.338\nput malicious software in there, and\nthen you come along and you install it?\n\n324\n00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:23.406\nWell, when you install\nit you do sudo apt-get.\n\n325\n00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:25.155\nYou're doing super user do.\n\n326\n00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:28.595\nYou're running it as the root user and\nwhen you install that malicious software\n\n327\n00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:32.350\nnow it's installed and hooked into your\nsystem, and now you've been compromised.\n\n328\n00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.090\nThat's really bad, so\nwe've gotta trust the vendor.\n\n329\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.430\nWell, I trust Webmin.\n\n330\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.030\nI know that software's\nbeen around a long time.\n\n331\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.730\nIt's a stable product.\n\n332\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.688\nIt does a good job, so I trust it.\n\n333\n00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:46.890\nBut, a hacker could still break in to\ntheir repository and change the files.\n\n334\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.640\nSo what a lot of vendors have started\ndoing is publishing security keys.\n\n335\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.090\nPublic keys that you can use to run a\nchecksum against the files to find out if\n\n336\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.370\nthey've been tampered with, and that\nway if a hacker modifies the packages,\n\n337\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.570\nthey'll fail the signature check and\nyou won't download and install them,\n\n338\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.140\nit's an extra safety net.\n\n339\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.810\nThey don't have to do that but it's a good\nidea, so any vendor that cares about\n\n340\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.680\nsecurity at all is doing this,\nthey're publishing these.\n\n341\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.646\nSo he's giving me the instructions\nright here to download his key and\n\n342\n00:18:16.646 --> 00:18:19.991\nthen import it in using\nthe apt-key command.\n\n343\n00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:21.870\nSo I'm gonna do that real quick.\n\n344\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:28.065\nI'm going to, Download that key, and then\nonce it's downloaded we can add that in.\n\n345\n00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:32.223\nNow his instructions here are assuming\nthat we're logged in his root, and\n\n346\n00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:32.820\nI'm not.\n\n347\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.180\nSo I'm gonna change it just a little\nbit and make sure I pseudo that, and\n\n348\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.010\nthat's gonna import that key, and\nnow when I pull down files that\n\n349\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:47.080\nhas been signed by the j cameron key,\nI can now verify it myself.\n\n350\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.550\nI can run the same checks on them,\n\n351\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.460\nand if get the same result,\nthe file has tampered with.\n\n352\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.161\nIf I get a different result, the file has\nbeen tampered with, and I can't trust it.\n\n353\n00:18:57.161 --> 00:19:00.874\nBut now, I can do ways to pseudo\napp get install webmin, and\n\n354\n00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:05.870\nI did this a moment ago and it said\nthe package couldn't be found, right?\n\n355\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.260\nWhat if I run it now?\n\n356\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.130\nWell, actually before I even run that,\nI need to do a pseudo app get\n\n357\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.594\nupdate to update my database, otherwise\nthe package might not be found again.\n\n358\n00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:15.913\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] ]\n&gt;&gt; I need to update my database and\n\n359\n00:19:15.913 --> 00:19:18.003\nnotice that last line right there,\n\n360\n00:19:18.003 --> 00:19:21.984\nit's pulling, or last two lines,\nfrom webmin.com/download.\n\n361\n00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:27.812\nSo it's getting a list of packages, and\nthere's not many packages in there,\n\n362\n00:19:27.812 --> 00:19:32.491\nbut it's going to pull them down,\nand now that I've got them,\n\n363\n00:19:32.491 --> 00:19:37.082\nI can come in and I can do the pseudo\napp get install webmin, and\n\n364\n00:19:37.082 --> 00:19:40.557\nwhen I run it,\nI don't get package not found.\n\n365\n00:19:40.557 --> 00:19:43.961\nI get that it found the package and\nit's ready to install it, and\n\n366\n00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:47.241\nit's kind of nice because in\naddition to installing webmin,\n\n367\n00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:51.190\nit's also installing other\nutilities that were necessary.\n\n368\n00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:56.450\nSo here's webmin, I needed that, but\nit turns out I also needed libauth,\n\n369\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.610\nthis is the authentication library for\nPerl.\n\n370\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.190\nSo it can do authentication.\n\n371\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.658\nWe've got apt show versions,\n\n372\n00:20:02.658 --> 00:20:06.441\nanother utility to be able to see which\nversions of software we have installed,\n\n373\n00:20:06.441 --> 00:20:09.726\nand so it's gonna install these\nother packages that webmin needed.\n\n374\n00:20:09.726 --> 00:20:13.715\nIf I didn't know that and I installed the\nsoftware the software wouldn't work, but\n\n375\n00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:15.100\napt is taking care of that.\n\n376\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.866\nIt's getting the information\nfrom the right places, and\n\n377\n00:20:17.866 --> 00:20:21.367\nwhat's also neat is that webmin is\ngonna come from their repository, but\n\n378\n00:20:21.367 --> 00:20:25.432\nthese other packages that we're dependent\non, those are gonna come from Ubuntu, or\n\n379\n00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:29.295\nCanonical, or whoever it is that built\nthe distribution that you're running.\n\n380\n00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:32.291\nIt's gonna come from this standard\nestablished source, and so\n\n381\n00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:36.059\nwhen I go ahead to install that, now its\ngonna reach out and its gonna install it,\n\n382\n00:20:36.059 --> 00:20:38.519\nand right here I can see\nwhere those are coming from.\n\n383\n00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:42.355\nHere's webmin, and then after it\nI see Canonical being listed for\n\n384\n00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:45.577\nlive authentication pam-pearl and\napt show version,\n\n385\n00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:49.619\nthose are coming right from the Ubuntu\nservers like we'd expect, and\n\n386\n00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:53.388\nwhen that's installed,\nit's now done, it's installed, and\n\n387\n00:20:53.388 --> 00:20:58.220\nI've installed third-party software that\nCanonical might not even know about.\n\n388\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.145\nThey may have never even heard of this\nsoftware, but now I've got it, and\n\n389\n00:21:03.145 --> 00:21:05.846\nany time I do a pseudo app-get upgrade,\n\n390\n00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:10.190\nI'm gonna be upgrading my operating\nsystem as well as webmin.\n\n391\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.585\nThis third party system is now part of\nmy regular routine upgrade process.\n\n392\n00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:16.614\nSo I don't have to worry about going and\ndownloading dev packages anymore or\n\n393\n00:21:16.614 --> 00:21:19.753\nanything, it's just all part of the big\nend system and works automatically.\n\n394\n00:21:19.753 --> 00:21:22.445\nThis is really the best way\nto have things configured.\n\n395\n00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:23.892\n&gt;&gt; And you can never be too careful.\n\n396\n00:21:23.892 --> 00:21:25.497\n[LAUGH] That's a wonderful thing.\n\n397\n00:21:25.497 --> 00:21:28.394\nAll right so the install,\nthat's great, we've got that.\n\n398\n00:21:28.394 --> 00:21:32.830\nBut what about if we've decided that\nwe don't want the software anymore?\n\n399\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.444\nWhat if we've decided some of these\nproperties we don't want anymore.\n\n400\n00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:38.348\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not all software lasts forever.\n\n401\n00:21:38.348 --> 00:21:39.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n402\n00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.700\n&gt;&gt; And I mentioned, I used to use webmin\nall the time, now I use Cockpit, instead.\n\n403\n00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.050\nSo maybe someday I install Cockpit,\nso I don't need webmin anymore, and\n\n404\n00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.160\nI wanna get rid of it.\n\n405\n00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.985\nWell, you can remove it, and removing\nsoftware used to be a real pain cuz you\n\n406\n00:21:50.985 --> 00:21:53.300\nhad to find all the different\nplaces that it stored its files.\n\n407\n00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.620\n&gt;&gt; All the dependencies?\n\n408\n00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there might be dependencies\nthat you don't need anymore,\n\n409\n00:21:57.113 --> 00:21:59.490\nthat need to get removed, and\nthat stuff was really challenging.\n\n410\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.576\nWell, now we just say\npseudo apt-get remove and\n\n411\n00:22:02.576 --> 00:22:06.370\nthen the software packets\nthat we don't need anymore.\n\n412\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.015\nSo I don't need webmin, and so\nI'll say, I wanna remove it.\n\n413\n00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:13.794\nNow notice I am saying app-get, like I'm\ngonna get something, but then I'm telling\n\n414\n00:22:13.794 --> 00:22:17.500\nit to remove something, so it's a little\nbit counter intuitive on that one.\n\n415\n00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.360\nBut it's gonna remove it, and\nnotice how it's not just removing webmin,\n\n416\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.342\nit's also removing app show versions,\ncuz nobody else needs it anymore, or\n\n417\n00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:27.076\nlive authentication Pam Pearl.\n\n418\n00:22:27.076 --> 00:22:29.170\nIt's getting rid of that,\nbecause we don't need that anymore.\n\n419\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.390\nSo it's smart enough to keep\ntrack of that and say all right,\n\n420\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.180\nwell we don't actually need this stuff\nanymore, we'll get rid of that, too.\n\n421\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.654\nIt's good housekeeping,\nand once that's done,\n\n422\n00:22:37.654 --> 00:22:41.335\nnow everything gets kind of cleaned out,\noff it goes, and actually it looks\n\n423\n00:22:41.335 --> 00:22:45.039\nlike we got little bit of an error there,\nso we might need to track that down.\n\n424\n00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.227\nIn this case, so\n\n425\n00:22:46.227 --> 00:22:50.190\nit's complaining cuz it tried to\nremove a folder that doesn't exist.\n\n426\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.060\nI never actually started webmin.\n\n427\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.728\nI installed it, but if I had started it,\nthese other folders would have been\n\n428\n00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:57.333\ncreated, so it's trying to purge\nfolders that weren't even there yet.\n\n429\n00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:58.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n430\n00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.029\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of nice, but\nit knows to check for that stuff.\n\n431\n00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:06.349\nSo once that's done it's now removed and I\ncan always install it again if I need it,\n\n432\n00:23:06.349 --> 00:23:09.410\nbut if I don't need it it's now gone and\nif I go.\n\n433\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:14.306\nSo apt get, we can use it from installing\nsoftware as well as removing software,\n\n434\n00:23:14.306 --> 00:23:16.259\nit does really the whole thing.\n\n435\n00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:18.370\n&gt;&gt; Don, this is great stuff.\n\n436\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.918\nSo is there any other uses for apt?\n\n437\n00:23:21.918 --> 00:23:26.319\n&gt;&gt; There's quite a few, and there's\na lot of a little advanced feature and\n\n438\n00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:28.040\nthings you can do with apt.\n\n439\n00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.188\nOne question I normally get is hey, Don,\neverything you showed me is great, but\n\n440\n00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:34.513\nwhat if I don't know\nthe name of the package?\n\n441\n00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:36.460\nWhat if I don't know what\nthe software is called?\n\n442\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.900\nI just want to find something,\nI want to find this web server but\n\n443\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.910\nI can't remember what's it's called or\nI ran into this with Apache all the time,\n\n444\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.200\nbecause the Apache package\nis not called Apache.\n\n445\n00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.793\nSo when you go to install it how do\nyou figure out what it's called?\n\n446\n00:23:48.793 --> 00:23:53.960\nWell there is a little search\nutility called apt-cache.\n\n447\n00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.034\nRemember when I said you\nrun pseudo apt-get update,\n\n448\n00:23:57.034 --> 00:23:59.160\nthat it's updating this database?\n\n449\n00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.457\nWell the apt cache utility lets you\nsearch through that database, and so\n\n450\n00:24:03.457 --> 00:24:07.328\nI can come through and I can say apt\ncache Search, and I can look for\n\n451\n00:24:07.328 --> 00:24:10.310\nsomething like apache,\nI can look for a keyword.\n\n452\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.260\nAnd it's gonna search that database and\n\n453\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.236\nreturn every package that mentions apache,\nand I can look through here,\n\n454\n00:24:17.236 --> 00:24:21.270\nthis is quite the list, and try and\nfind the one that I'm actually needing.\n\n455\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.760\nAnd in the case of Apache,\nit's actually just called HTTPD.\n\n456\n00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.940\nWhich I might have too much here.\n\n457\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.240\nI should have piped this.\n\n458\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.840\nYou can pipe it into GREP to kinda\nfilter it down, or you can pipe it into\n\n459\n00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.050\na text file so you can then go and search\nthe text file and look for stuff there.\n\n460\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.090\nBut you can search for these keywords, and\n\n461\n00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.070\nby doing that,\nyou get information back to findings.\n\n462\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.190\nAnd it's just searching\nthat local database, and\n\n463\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.070\nit's always a good idea to\nupdate that database first.\n\n464\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:50.245\nSo I could say apt -get update and\nit'll update that database and then I use\n\n465\n00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:55.730\napt cache to go in and search and\nlook through the database and find things.\n\n466\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.540\nSo, that's one way to go about it.\n\n467\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.394\nThere's actually another utility out there\ncalled Aptitude, and Aptitude is not\n\n468\n00:25:02.394 --> 00:25:06.420\ninstalled by default, I don't think\nit's installed by default on any distro.\n\n469\n00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.365\nBut it is a part of\nthe normal repositories so\n\n470\n00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:16.054\nif you do a sudo apt get install aptitude.\n\n471\n00:25:16.054 --> 00:25:19.424\nAnd you spell it right, there we go,\nwe can install Aptitude.\n\n472\n00:25:19.424 --> 00:25:24.520\nAnd what Aptitude will do is, actually\nI apparently already have it installed.\n\n473\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.930\nWhat Aptitude will do is it will let\nyou kind of browse the packages.\n\n474\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.600\nSo if I come in and just run aptitude,\n\n475\n00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.970\nyou get kind of a pseudo\ngraphical user interface.\n\n476\n00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.465\nAnd I can come in and\nI can look at installed packages,\n\n477\n00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:44.140\nnot installed packages,\nvirtual packages and tasks.\n\n478\n00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.870\nSo I might go into my Not Installed.\n\n479\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.556\nThere's 82,000 packages\nthat I haven't installed.\n\n480\n00:25:48.556 --> 00:25:51.026\n&gt;&gt; Well, that would only take\nyou a day and a half to look at.\n\n481\n00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:51.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe, maybe.\n\n482\n00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.054\nSo, but I can come in here and\nI can start to look and\n\n483\n00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:57.342\nthey are actually kinda broken up by\ncategory, so that helps a little bit.\n\n484\n00:25:57.342 --> 00:26:00.860\nIt's still a lot, so I might go\ninto admin packages or whatever.\n\n485\n00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.619\nAnd so you can browse through here and\nthis is neat because you can browse, so\n\n486\n00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:07.402\nyou can find things you might\nnot otherwise know about.\n\n487\n00:26:07.402 --> 00:26:10.714\nAnd when you find them, you actually get\na nice little description at the bottom of\n\n488\n00:26:10.714 --> 00:26:12.830\nthe screen that's kinda\ntelling you what they are.\n\n489\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:18.770\nSo I might go under admin, whoops,\nand go into admin, there we go.\n\n490\n00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.270\nAnd then into main,\nwhich is the main support itself, and\n\n491\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.830\nnow I'm looking at the actual\npackages in there.\n\n492\n00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.480\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n493\n00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.000\n&gt;&gt; And you can browse through and find,\nyou can search through and stuff.\n\n494\n00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.670\nYou see all the commands up\nhere at the top of the screen.\n\n495\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.680\nSo we can search and\nother things to find what we want.\n\n496\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.930\nIt's a neat little utility that\njust gives you that ability to\n\n497\n00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.010\nquickly find what you're looking for and\nkind of browse around and experiment.\n\n498\n00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.210\nYou've got your graphical stuff too,\n\n499\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.880\nif you're on the server you don't have the\ngraphical stuff, but on a work station,\n\n500\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.300\nyou can always go into the software\nutility, this Ubuntu software.\n\n501\n00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.030\nBut you'll find that some software\ndoesn't show up in here and\n\n502\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.510\nI have mixed results\nactually installing things.\n\n503\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.966\nIf you're looking for server services,\n\n504\n00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:59.100\nthey don't show up here like if\nI wanna set up a web server.\n\n505\n00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.350\nI can't do that from here.\n\n506\n00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.446\nSo the apt utility from the command\nline is really superior to that.\n\n507\n00:27:04.446 --> 00:27:07.610\nAnd I've been using apt pretty plainly.\n\n508\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.540\nI used apt get install and\napt get removed.\n\n509\n00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.740\nBut there are a lot of other\ncommand line tags that you can use,\n\n510\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.340\nlike list and search.\n\n511\n00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.420\nSo I can search for\nthose packages right from the apt utility.\n\n512\n00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.540\nInstall and remove I use,\nautoremove is a neat one.\n\n513\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.820\nThere are times, in fact,\nI think I had a warning about it,\n\n514\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.240\nwhere you can end up with some packages\nleft over that you don't need anymore.\n\n515\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.161\nSo when I ran the apt -get update command,\nI think I saw a complaint earlier.\n\n516\n00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:36.650\nLet's see if it comes up here.\n\n517\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.294\nThat said I had some packages\nI didn't need anymore.\n\n518\n00:27:39.294 --> 00:27:40.584\nNo, I guess not.\n\n519\n00:27:40.584 --> 00:27:45.000\nYou know what?\nIt was when I went to install Aptitude.\n\n520\n00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.050\nSo if I install aptitude again and\nsee, there we go.\n\n521\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.580\nSee how it says this, the following\npackages were automatically installed and\n\n522\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.840\nare no longer required.\n\n523\n00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.820\nI ended up with a few extras and\nit's apt show versions and\n\n524\n00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.050\nlib authentication pam perl.\n\n525\n00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.350\nIt was supposed to remove\nthose when we removed Webmin.\n\n526\n00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.440\nBut something happened, and it didn't\nactually remove them for some reason.\n\n527\n00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:13.060\nBut we can come in and we can say,\nsudo apt get autoremove, like that.\n\n528\n00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.730\nAnd it'll remove those\npackages that we don't need.\n\n529\n00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.850\nAnd notice here how they're telling me\nto run sudo apt instead of apt -get.\n\n530\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.835\nBecause that's that alias that's in place.\n\n531\n00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:23.119\nAnd that makes a little more sense for\n\n532\n00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:25.370\npeople cuz I'm not getting\nsomething when I'm autoremoving.\n\n533\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.459\nSo, but it's the same thing,\nI'm running apt -get autoremove here.\n\n534\n00:28:28.459 --> 00:28:31.409\nAnd it'll remove those packages and\nget them out of there so\n\n535\n00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:34.831\nthat they're not taking up space on\nmy system or increasing my attack\n\n536\n00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:38.315\nsurface by having software I don't\nneed and kinda clearing that out.\n\n537\n00:28:38.315 --> 00:28:43.043\nSome of the other things you can do when\nyou do an install, you can do a /d and\n\n538\n00:28:43.043 --> 00:28:47.641\nit'll tell it to just download\nthe package but not actually install it.\n\n539\n00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:50.368\nThat's useful if you want to\ndo something offline later,\n\n540\n00:28:50.368 --> 00:28:54.135\nyou can download a bunch of packages now\nand install them at your leisure later.\n\n541\n00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:57.643\n-f can be used to try and\nfix a broken package.\n\n542\n00:28:57.643 --> 00:29:00.499\nSo maybe I installed a package and\nI did something and messed it up,\n\n543\n00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:02.310\nmaybe I deleted a file by accident.\n\n544\n00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.640\nSo I could do the install command and\nif I do install for\n\n545\n00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.110\na package that's already installed,\nit usually just ignores it, but\n\n546\n00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.046\nif you do a -f,\nit's like telling it to reinstall, right?\n\n547\n00:29:11.046 --> 00:29:15.224\n-f or a --fix is the other alias for\nthat one or,\n\n548\n00:29:15.224 --> 00:29:19.014\nI'm sorry, --fix -broken is what it is.\n\n549\n00:29:19.014 --> 00:29:20.680\nSo those are couple of other ones.\n\n550\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.780\nYou can do a -y to make it just\nautomatically say yes to anything that\n\n551\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.490\nit's about to do.\n\n552\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.620\nThat's nice if you tried to schedule this\nto run with a Cron job or something.\n\n553\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.324\nBut for the most part,\napt get update, apt get upgrade,\n\n554\n00:29:33.324 --> 00:29:38.100\napt get distgrade,\nright those the three main ones.\n\n555\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.410\nAnd then,\napp get install followed by package name.\n\n556\n00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.550\nApt get removed followed by package name.\n\n557\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.878\nThose are really the key.\n\n558\n00:29:43.878 --> 00:29:45.880\nIf you can remember all\nthose five commands,\n\n559\n00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.020\nthose are the key critical engine need for\napt.\n\n560\n00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.650\nThe other stuff like Aptitude and\nfixing broken stuff,\n\n561\n00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.060\nthose are far less common so you can\njust look those up when you need them.\n\n562\n00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.880\nBut the key five commands, those are what\nyou're gonna need to keep your system\n\n563\n00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.050\nup to date, healthy and\nkeep your software installed and running.\n\n564\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:01.870\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Don.\n\n565\n00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.770\nBecoming a Linux system administrator,\n\n566\n00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.559\nmanaging software with Apt,\nanything else you wanna leave us with?\n\n567\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.343\nLast words?\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it,\n\n568\n00:30:09.343 --> 00:30:13.180\ndo be aware that there's plenty of other\nutilities out there that work with Apt.\n\n569\n00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.255\nThey have an open API so\nthere's a lot of other systems,\n\n570\n00:30:15.255 --> 00:30:17.030\ndon't hesitate to use\nthe other software too.\n\n571\n00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.700\nBut Apt is a really great\ninfrastructure for managing packages.\n\n572\n00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.010\nThere is another technology coming\ndown the line called Flat Pack that is\n\n573\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:30.310\nsupposedly going to replace Apt, but that\nis not gonna happen for years and years.\n\n574\n00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.910\nThat's gonna be a ways down the wet line.\n\n575\n00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.472\nSo for right now,\nApt is your go-to utility for\n\n576\n00:30:34.472

00:00:04.727\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:08.050\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.687\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:13.019\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.028\njoining us again on ITproTV where\nwe help you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:20.715\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with becoming a Linux\n\n9\n00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.808\nsystem administrator and\nvery cool topic right here.\n\n10\n00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:28.891\nWe're gonna be doing managing\nsoftware with YUM and DNF.\n\n11\n00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.413\nAnd providing all the information\nwe need is our very own, Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:33.593\nHey, Don, good to see you, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:34.924\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:38.236\nYeah, ready to dive into the world of the\nYUM and DNF, which are two utilities that,\n\n15\n00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:40.350\nI'll tell you I have spent\na lot of time working with.\n\n16\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.051\nAnd if you use any of the RedHat, Centas,\nor Fedora variances of Linux that\n\n17\n00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:48.493\nare out there you're gonna\nencounter these guys too.\n\n18\n00:00:48.493 --> 00:00:49.800\nSo very important utilities,\n\n19\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.915\nthey're the ones we're gonna use when\nit comes to installing software,\n\n20\n00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.297\nuninstalling, removing software,\nmaintaining and updating, upgrading.\n\n21\n00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:59.661\nObviously very critical features here\nto keep our system up and going so\n\n22\n00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.702\nthat's what we're taking a look\nat right here in this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:05.430\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nwhy are learning about two utilities?\n\n24\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.096\nWhy not just one?\n\n25\n00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:09.504\n&gt;&gt; We've got some kind\nof identity complex.\n\n26\n00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:10.191\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n27\n00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe're learning about two because out there\n\n28\n00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:16.680\nin the real world you still see both,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.133\nYUM is the older utility,\nDNF is the new one.\n\n30\n00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.882\nThere's actually a third\nutility called RPM, right?\n\n31\n00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:23.419\nThis all started back in the day,\n&gt;&gt; RPM by the way.\n\n32\n00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:26.725\n&gt;&gt; In the early Red Hat days, we had RPM,\nthe Red Hat Package Manager, and\n\n33\n00:01:26.725 --> 00:01:29.999\nit would allow you to install packages,\nyou could install a program.\n\n34\n00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.320\nThe problem with RPM is it didn't\ndo any dependency checking at all.\n\n35\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.744\nSo if I was installing the Google Chrome\nweb browser via an RPM, and\n\n36\n00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:45.038\nit depended on GLib C or a bunch of other\nlibraries, RPM didn't check for that.\n\n37\n00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:48.991\nAnd so I might be able to install\nChrome but not actually run it and so\n\n38\n00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:50.269\nthings were broken.\n\n39\n00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.550\nSo YUM was actually\npart of a side project.\n\n40\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.592\nThere was a project called\nYellow Dog Linux and\n\n41\n00:01:56.592 --> 00:02:01.831\nYellow Dog Linux was a version of Red Hat\nthat would run on a Mac or run on PowerPC.\n\n42\n00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.643\nWe don't see Power PC machines anymore,\n\n43\n00:02:03.643 --> 00:02:06.241\nso Yellow Dog is not nearly as\nprevalent as it was back then.\n\n44\n00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:08.931\nBut they created\nthe Yellow Dog Update Manager.\n\n45\n00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.366\nAnd what it did was it would\nallow you to install package and\n\n46\n00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:13.712\nit could look at the dependencies\nthat package needed.\n\n47\n00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:17.324\nIt would say hey, if I installed Chrome,\nit also needs Open SSL to be able to do\n\n48\n00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.560\nencryption, it needs\nall these other things.\n\n49\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.762\nSo it will install them at the same time\nand it did a pretty decent job at this.\n\n50\n00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:27.944\n&gt;&gt; But wouldn't it be get guidem, widem,\nget yellow dog, it would wouldn't it?\n\n51\n00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:28.982\n&gt;&gt; Yellow Dog Update Manager.\n\n52\n00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they just kinda truncate it,\n\n53\n00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:30.817\nI guess yum sounds nicer.\n\n54\n00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.444\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does sound better.\n\n55\n00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:33.350\n&gt;&gt; It is sad but\n\n56\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.539\nhow it sounds is kind of what these\nguys use to pick names sometimes.\n\n57\n00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:39.092\n&gt;&gt; Yum, yum, yum.\n\n58\n00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.365\n&gt;&gt; And so, that's what YUM did.\n\n59\n00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:45.388\nThe thing about YUM though, is that\nit's old, it's been around a long time.\n\n60\n00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:48.262\nLike PowerPC processors,\nwhen's the last time you saw one of those?\n\n61\n00:02:48.262 --> 00:02:51.360\nIn a laptop, for example,\nthey're not common.\n\n62\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.289\nSo, that technology hasn't\naged all that well.\n\n63\n00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.627\nThe database that it uses for\ntracking dependencies has some problems,\n\n64\n00:02:57.627 --> 00:02:58.890\nit's not always perfect.\n\n65\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.115\nAnd it frequently leaves files behind\nwhich is a problem in and of itself.\n\n66\n00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:05.322\nSo there's a new guy in town, right?\n\n67\n00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:08.208\nTo take the place of YUM, and that is DNF.\n\n68\n00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:12.242\nNow, DNF stands for,\nit's not what you think?\n\n69\n00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:16.568\nDNF stands for Dandified YUM and,\nyeah, it's dumb.\n\n70\n00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:20.164\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So basically, what that is,\n\n71\n00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:25.414\nis a complete rewrite of YUM from scratch,\nwith an all new database,\n\n72\n00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:28.960\nthat does far superior\ndependency tracking.\n\n73\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.072\nIt's able to come in, and say, we're gonna\nkeep track of these dependencies better\n\n74\n00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:35.710\nand make sure we have good\nlogic being applied to each.\n\n75\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.377\nAnd we'll have a fully documented API\nthat programmers can interface with to\n\n76\n00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:43.839\nbe able to call DNF,\nto be able to perform these actions.\n\n77\n00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.115\nSo, DNF syntactically is\nalmost identical to YUM,\n\n78\n00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:50.420\nthe commands that we run\nare almost identical.\n\n79\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.365\nSo, for most users, we won't notice\nthe difference between YUM and DNF,\n\n80\n00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:54.880\nthey're interchangeable, right?\n\n81\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.941\nSo, what do we care which one we use.\n\n82\n00:03:56.941 --> 00:04:00.133\nBut, from the developers side,\nfrom the OS side,\n\n83\n00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.818\nfrom the support side DNF is far superior.\n\n84\n00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:07.241\nAnd so, that's the new guy in town and\nthat's the one everybody's gonna move to.\n\n85\n00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:13.908\nRight now, Fedora uses DNF by default, Red\nHat and CentOS do not, they still use YUM.\n\n86\n00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:17.261\nFortunately, from the command-line,\nit's almost the same, right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:19.087\nSo we don't have to learn\nanything different.\n\n88\n00:04:19.087 --> 00:04:22.910\nBut as soon as you're on an OS that\nsupports DNF, you want to use it.\n\n89\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.496\nIt's the superior of the two but\n\n90\n00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:28.562\nthat's why their show is covering both\nbecause you still both that are out there.\n\n91\n00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:33.550\n&gt;&gt; So okay, we use YUM or\nDNF to grab software, right?\n\n92\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.082\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But where is this software coming from?\n\n93\n00:04:35.082 --> 00:04:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the software is\ncoming from a repository, and\n\n94\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.010\nthat is the neat part about DNF and\nYUM is that the repositories don't change.\n\n95\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.388\nYou have all these packages\nthat are stored on a server or\n\n96\n00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:46.370\nsomewhere out there on the Internet,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.253\nAnd, or you could even have\nan internal repository if you want.\n\n98\n00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.852\nAnd you reach out and\nyou get that software.\n\n99\n00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:56.835\nNow when you install Red Hat or CentOS or\nFedora, they have certain repositories\n\n100\n00:04:56.835 --> 00:05:01.460\ndefined by default that they looked to and\nthen when we can add more on to it.\n\n101\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.595\nSo for example my laptop,\nI'm running Fedora and\n\n102\n00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.589\nI've already got some repos defined,\nright?\n\n103\n00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:10.874\nA repo is short for a repository,\nserver that holds files.\n\n104\n00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:18.115\nAnd if you go into /etc/yum.repos.d,\nall right?\n\n105\n00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:18.884\nThat's a folder.\nAnd\n\n106\n00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:24.727\nin that folder will be a file defined for\neach repository that you support.\n\n107\n00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:30.580\nNow I've got a bunch in here that you may\nnot have or that you probably don't have.\n\n108\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.401\nIn fact,\nif you do a clean install of Fedora,\n\n109\n00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:36.539\nyou'll likely just have\nthese first four right?\n\n110\n00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:42.430\nFedora, Cisco Open H264, fedora.repo,\nFedora Updates and Fedora Updates Testing.\n\n111\n00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.965\nOkay, each of these are different\nrepositories that contain software, right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:53.398\nThe main one, fedora.repo, that one has a\nlot of software in it that is open source,\n\n113\n00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:57.547\nthat is fully supported by the Fedora\nteam that you can install and\n\n114\n00:05:57.547 --> 00:05:59.521\nit's free of charge, right?\n\n115\n00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:02.929\nSo that's where the bulk of our\nsoftware's going to come from.\n\n116\n00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:06.320\nAnd if I look inside of that file,\nfedora.repo,\n\n117\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.647\nyou'll see that there's\nnot that much in here.\n\n118\n00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:15.348\nIt's kinda broken up into these sections,\nso here's the main repo called Fedora and\n\n119\n00:06:15.348 --> 00:06:19.402\nit's pointing to a URL,\ndownload.fedoraproject.org.\n\n120\n00:06:19.402 --> 00:06:23.304\nAnd on their site there's a subfolder and\nyou can browse in and you can find all\n\n121\n00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:27.701\nthe packages that are available for your\nsystem, and so that's where it's looking.\n\n122\n00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:29.600\nBut notice there's more\nthan one repo in here.\n\n123\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.910\nTechnically this first entry,\nthis is the fedora repo.\n\n124\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.278\nBut if I keep looking down in that file,\nI'll see there's other ones.\n\n125\n00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:40.879\nThere's fedora debuginfo, right?\n\n126\n00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.228\nIf we turn on debug or\nfedora source the source code repository,\n\n127\n00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:45.848\nwe can get all the source code.\n\n128\n00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:50.715\nBut if you look at some of this,\nnotice on the very first one, enabled=1,\n\n129\n00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:53.238\nthis repost turned on, I'm using it.\n\n130\n00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:57.887\nThese other two, enabled=0,\nthey're turned off.\n\n131\n00:06:57.887 --> 00:07:01.924\nIf I want to use those repos I either\nneed to change those zeroes to one and\n\n132\n00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:03.148\nI'll always use it.\n\n133\n00:07:03.148 --> 00:07:07.524\nOr from the command line I can\noverride and say --enable-repo and\n\n134\n00:07:07.524 --> 00:07:09.761\nspecify the number and turn it on.\n\n135\n00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:12.901\nSo you can do it just once every now and\nthen when you need them.\n\n136\n00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:17.272\nBut you can have more than one\nrepository defined in a single file or\n\n137\n00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:19.235\nyou can have separate files.\n\n138\n00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:22.787\nAnd you'll see like, for\nme I installed Google Chrome, and so\n\n139\n00:07:22.787 --> 00:07:25.210\nhere's google-chrome.repo, right?\n\n140\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.450\nOr if you install the betas,\nthey have a different repo for that.\n\n141\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.680\nHere's the google-chrome.beta.repo, right?\n\n142\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.892\nOr I used RPM fusion, RPM Fusion has\na lot of non supported binaries.\n\n143\n00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:39.829\nMaybe there's some software you want\nthat Fedora isn't supporting yet\n\n144\n00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:42.292\nthat's even more cutting edge than Fedora.\n\n145\n00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:44.839\nSo you can add those and\nyou'll see I've added several.\n\n146\n00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.830\nAnd they have free versus\nnon-free repositories.\n\n147\n00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.809\nI don't remember what I installed.\n\n148\n00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:51.780\nThat was in rpmfusion,\nwhich is probably a problem I have.\n\n149\n00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.627\nBut [LAUGH] there was something\nI installed that I needed those.\n\n150\n00:07:55.627 --> 00:07:59.607\nSkype, the Microsoft Skype conferencing\nsoftware, or Sublime Text,\n\n151\n00:07:59.607 --> 00:08:02.556\nthat's a text editor I use for\ndarn near everything.\n\n152\n00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:03.634\nI've installed repos for those.\n\n153\n00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:07.690\nNow, why would I have separate repos for\nsome software like that?\n\n154\n00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.980\nWell, if it's closed source software\n\n155\n00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.680\nthen Fedora won't normally\nallow it in their repositories.\n\n156\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.800\nSo the vendors can choose to support their\nown, they can have their own repo, and\n\n157\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.120\nby having a repo when\nyou install software.\n\n158\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.180\nAnytime you do an update,\nthat repo gets checked and\n\n159\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.360\nif there's an update version\nit automatically updates.\n\n160\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.910\nSo, I installed sublime text and\n\n161\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.350\nnow it's automatically being updated,\nevery time that repository is updated.\n\n162\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.520\nOr I installed Skype and\nnow it's automatically being updated.\n\n163\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.360\nIf I just installed the package and\nthat was it, without a repository,\n\n164\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.350\nI would have to manually update that\nsoftware anytime there was a change.\n\n165\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.920\nBut this is where the software\nis coming from, at a minimum,\n\n166\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.750\nyou'll have the default repository,\nand you're pulling that from distro.\n\n167\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.930\nRedhat, Centos, Fedora,\nthey all have their own repositories\n\n168\n00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.900\nwith packages built for\nthat particular distribution.\n\n169\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.870\nAnd then you can modify that to\nstart integrating your own in there.\n\n170\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.680\nNow, this is how we do it in Yum and DNF.\n\n171\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.718\nThat folder is /etc/yum.ripples.d, right?\n\n172\n00:09:09.718 --> 00:09:11.880\nSo, that's the folder that I'm in.\n\n173\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.170\nEven DNF uses that.\n\n174\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.390\nBut that's just for now.\n\n175\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.220\nIn the future, right?\n\n176\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.720\nLike probably far in the future,\nwe'll stop using these folder, and\n\n177\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.148\nwe'll start using a different file.\n\n178\n00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:26.470\nInside of there's a dnf folder and\n\n179\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.880\ninside of dnf you'll find dnf.conf, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.660\nRight now,\ndnf.conf is not packed full of a of data.\n\n181\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.093\nThree lines, gpgcheck set to 1,\ninstallonly limit=3,\n\n182\n00:09:39.093 --> 00:09:42.530\nclean_requirements_on_remove=True, and\nthat's it.\n\n183\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.300\nBut in the future,\n\n184\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.850\nyou'll define your repositories\nright here in this one file, right?\n\n185\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.400\nBut nobody has made any move to push for\nthat just yet.\n\n186\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.968\nSo until anybody says differently,\nyou're gonna use\n\n187\n00:09:55.968 --> 00:10:01.570\n/etc/yam.repos.D.folder even though\nyou are using dnf and so that's\n\n188\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.700\nnice again because you don't have to learn\ntwo different ways to do things, right,\n\n189\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.350\nbecause I might be using red head on all\nmy servers and I might be using fedora on\n\n190\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:13.390\nall my work stations and that means dnf on\nthe work stations yam on the servers, but\n\n191\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.430\nthey are using the same configuration\nfiles, that makes life little easier,\n\n192\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.765\ni did want to be aware of this file,\nbecause if you are watching this video and\n\n193\n00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:23.334\nits 2019 [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n194\n00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:24.878\n&gt;&gt; Then first of congratulations,\n\n195\n00:10:24.878 --> 00:10:26.150\non being in future.\n\n196\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.546\nAnd second make sure you use dnf.conf.\n\n197\n00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:29.982\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, greetings from the past.\n\n198\n00:10:29.982 --> 00:10:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] It's like a time capsule\n\n199\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.052\nof technology.\n\n200\n00:10:34.052 --> 00:10:36.005\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] All right,\nlet's play some [INAUDIBLE].\n\n201\n00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:36.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n202\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.330\nso that's basically where this\nsoftware is going to come from.\n\n203\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.980\nNow, I mentioned how I have some\ncustom repos that are loaded on mine.\n\n204\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.870\nNormally, I'm just gonna pull\nright from the main repos.\n\n205\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.720\nSo, if I wanna install something like,\n\n206\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.170\nmaybe I want the chromium web browser\nwhich I already have installed.\n\n207\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:02.620\nI would just come in and say something\nlike, dnf install Chromium, and it would\n\n208\n00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.180\nreach out into the default repositories\nand grab that data and install it.\n\n209\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.440\nBut if I will install third party\nsoftware, something like webmin right?\n\n210\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.870\nAnd I go to install that,\nwell there is no webmin.\n\n211\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.610\nBecause webmin is not in\nthe official fedora repositories.\n\n212\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.860\nSo for that, it's third party software.\n\n213\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.930\nAnd if you gonna webmin website,\nthey actually have instructions on here\n\n214\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.970\nsomewhere where they tell\nyou how to get that set up.\n\n215\n00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.850\nUnder downloads I can go in and\nI can download the RPM, but\n\n216\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.170\nremember the RPM doesn't\ndo dependency checking.\n\n217\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.500\nWell, I can install the RPM with EOM and\nthat will do some dependency checking, so\n\n218\n00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.700\nthat solves that problem.\n\n219\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.970\nBut, it won't automatically update,\n\n220\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.370\nI have to go download the new RPM\nevery time there was an update.\n\n221\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.780\nBut if you look over here on the left\nside, I can pull up instructions and\n\n222\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:52.650\nthey tell you how to install using YUM or\nusing a custom repository.\n\n223\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:58.770\nAnd so they give me some text right here,\nif I put this in a repository file,\n\n224\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.550\nso if I just copy that text, and\ndrop that into a repository file.\n\n225\n00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.590\nI'll now be able to dynamically update\nit right from their repository.\n\n226\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:14.150\nSo, I could get into /etc/yum.repos.d/.\n\n227\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.310\nI could edit a file,\nI'll just call it webmin dot,\n\n228\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:24.490\nI mean, you can call it whatever you want,\nreally, but webmin.repo.\n\n229\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.650\nUsually people end in .repo,\nis what you kinda saw as the default.\n\n230\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:32.320\nAnd then, I just need to basically\njust paste that information in, right?\n\n231\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.360\nYou're giving it a name.\n\n232\n00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.120\nThat's just a visual name that lets\nyou know what it is you're adding.\n\n233\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.940\nAnd you can call it whatever you want.\n\n234\n00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.890\nThen the base URL.\n\n235\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.300\nThat's the really important part.\n\n236\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.720\nThis is where we need to\nlook to find the repository.\n\n237\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.530\nThe third line is a mirror list.\n\n238\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:50.090\nThe mirror list is saying I don't have\nto download it right from Webmin.\n\n239\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.840\nWebmin might actually have mirror And\nI get better performance and\n\n240\n00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.220\nwith open source projects like this you\nalways want to use a mirror if you can,\n\n241\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.640\nbecause basically there having a pay for\nthat bandwidth and\n\n242\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.610\nyou're not giving them anything, so\nthis is the way we help with that and\n\n243\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.530\nthen enable because one\nthat's gonna turn it on.\n\n244\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.650\nSo, I'm now adding this repository and\nwhen I saved that,\n\n245\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.560\nnow whenever I search for software\nIt's gonna look into that repository.\n\n246\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.640\nSo if I were to do a dnf list webmin,\na moment ago it couldn't find webmin.\n\n247\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.060\nIt didn't exist.\n\n248\n00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.810\nNow, it's gonna look out, and see how it\njust checked Webmin Distribution Neutral?\n\n249\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.280\nAnd then, it found it right there,\nwebmin.noarchictecture.\n\n250\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.490\nIt found that file and\nnow I'm able to dynamically install it.\n\n251\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.240\nAnd dynamically updated and\nto continue to work with it from there.\n\n252\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.000\nNow, quick word of caution\nabout third party repositories.\n\n253\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.920\nWhen you use the official Fedora\nrepository, everything in there\n\n254\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.930\nhas been digitally signed and\nis verified to not be tampered with.\n\n255\n00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.380\nWhen you add a third-party\nrepository though,\n\n256\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.000\na hacker could break into that repo and\nmodify a file.\n\n257\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.700\nThis happened with the Transmission\nBitTorrent client a few months ago,\n\n258\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.710\nwhere hackers got into the repo,\ninjected malware right\n\n259\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.930\ninto the Transmission client,\nand that way if you downloaded it\n\n260\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.620\nyou were loading a back door on your\nsystem, you were loading a root kit and\n\n261\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.915\ncompromising your system and\nyou were doing it willingly.\n\n262\n00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:12.152\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; You were downloading it with root\n\n263\n00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:13.080\nprivileges.\n\n264\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.440\n&gt;&gt; People can be so nasty.\n\n265\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there is a method for\nprotecting from that.\n\n266\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.520\nMost authors are now digitally\nsigning their files too.\n\n267\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.550\nSo if you look at the webmin instructions,\nif I scroll down just a little bit.\n\n268\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.090\nHere he's giving instructions on\nhow to download his public key- And\n\n269\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.970\nthen you can import his public key,\nand now whenever you install Webmin or\n\n270\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.610\nany update, it'll check to make sure\nthat the checks on the file is right and\n\n271\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.430\nthat the file hasn't been tampered with.\n\n272\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.240\nSo I'm going to do that, obviously\nI want to be able to check that and\n\n273\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.100\nmake sure that I don't get compromised.\n\n274\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.430\nSo I'm gonna come in here first,\nI need to get out of this folder.\n\n275\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.810\nLet me get into my own folder here.\n\n276\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.440\nI'm gonna download his key.\n\n277\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.362\nAnd then, I need to import that key in.\n\n278\n00:15:00.362 --> 00:15:03.045\nWe're gonna use the old\nrpm command to do that.\n\n279\n00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:07.480\nrpm-import and\nthen the name of the key file.\n\n280\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.060\nAnd when we do that.\n\n281\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.866\nThat'll import the key and,\noop I got an import failure.\n\n282\n00:15:11.866 --> 00:15:13.067\n[LAUGH] Permission denied.\n\n283\n00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:15.240\n[LAUGH] We need to Sulu this one.\n\n284\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.590\nYou do need to be an administrator loader.\n\n285\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.780\nThere we go.\nNow, it's loaded.\n\n286\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:23.290\nSo, now, if a release gets tampered with\nthe system will be able to detect that.\n\n287\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.900\nAnd it will know that there's a problem.\n\n288\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.900\nAnd it didn't pass the hash based on\nthis public key to be able to find out\n\n289\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.030\nwhat was what, so\nthat's an extra level of protection.\n\n290\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.950\nI didn't have to do that.\n\n291\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.700\nIf I didn't do that step when I\ninstalled Webmen it would say hey we\n\n292\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.650\ndon't have a signature to verify\ndo you want to ignore it?\n\n293\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.250\nAnd I could say yes, you can ignore it.\n\n294\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.370\nRight.?\nBut then, it could be tampered with.\n\n295\n00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.140\nBy doing it this way, now it'll test and\nmake sure that it's not tamper with.\n\n296\n00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.157\nSo anytime you add a third-party\nrepository, look for keys like these.\n\n297\n00:15:51.157 --> 00:15:52.557\nThat will really make a difference and\n\n298\n00:15:52.557 --> 00:15:54.271\nto help keep your system\na little more secure.\n\n299\n00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:57.372\n&gt;&gt; Now, a lot of times, you get more than\none result, you get a bunch of results.\n\n300\n00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:58.988\nHow do you know which one is correct?\n\n301\n00:15:58.988 --> 00:16:04.225\nWhen we look for software, right,\nhere it's pretty straightforward.\n\n302\n00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:05.121\nIt's Webmin, there's only one, right?\n\n303\n00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:08.300\nHere, let me show you a couple\nbase commands here real quick.\n\n304\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.770\nWhen we're hunting for\nsoftware, I can come in and\n\n305\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:15.340\nI can say dnf list and I can look for\nsoftware with particular name right?\n\n306\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.060\nSo if I do dnf list webmin, well,\n\n307\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.680\nI'm only gonna get one entry there\nright cuz there's only one webmin, so\n\n308\n00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.730\nit makes sense easy that's\nthe one that I want to install.\n\n309\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:29.000\nBut dnf list is actually searching for\npackages that have webmin in the name.\n\n310\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.400\nAnd if I pick something\na little more generic,\n\n311\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.610\nI might find a lot of results, right?\n\n312\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.580\nIf I do something like dnf list python,\nand I go look for\n\n313\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.870\nanything with Python in the name.\n\n314\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.270\nWell, I see two Pythons.\n\n315\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:46.385\nThere's python.x 86_64 and python.i686.\n\n316\n00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:47.545\nOkay, which one do I want?\n\n317\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:49.850\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n318\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.916\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, x 86 64, that's 64 bit.\n\n319\n00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:53.930\nThat sounds like what I want.\n\n320\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.740\ni686, I don't know,\nis that what I want, right?\n\n321\n00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.570\nAnd if you look,\nit tells you where they're coming from.\n\n322\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.500\nI've got one that's coming from updates,\nand\n\n323\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.500\nthe other one's coming\nfrom updates as well.\n\n324\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.328\nOne's already installed,\nwhich is why it has the little @ symbol.\n\n325\n00:17:07.328 --> 00:17:09.504\nThe other one's available,\nit's not installed yet.\n\n326\n00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:12.790\nSo these are two packages,\nthey look almost identical.\n\n327\n00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.060\nGot the same version number on them,\nright?\n\n328\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.880\nSo what is the difference here?\n\n329\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.370\nWell, to figure out the difference,\n\n330\n00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.760\nto figure out which one you want to\ninstall, you need to look at the name.\n\n331\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.130\nThat's where you get one part of the hint,\nright?\n\n332\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.579\nSo this is python.x86_64.\n\n333\n00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.729\nPython's the name of the package.\n\n334\n00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:35.078\nx86_64 is the architecture, and\nthat is a 64-bit processor based on\n\n335\n00:17:35.078 --> 00:17:40.772\nthe AMD standard, which is what my Intel\ni7 is that is, so that's the one I want.\n\n336\n00:17:40.772 --> 00:17:47.330\ni686, that's actually tied to Intel's\nItanium, which not many people run.\n\n337\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.760\nI don't have an Itanium processor,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n338\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.078\nSo that architecture right there is enough\nto help me know whether that's the one\n\n339\n00:17:54.078 --> 00:17:57.800\nthat I want or not, but\nthere is another command I can use.\n\n340\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.220\ndnf list, that's just showing me\nthe names of the packages, right?\n\n341\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:07.960\nI could do dnf info, and\nnow I get some more detailed information.\n\n342\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.165\nSo I could say dnf info python.i686, and\n\n343\n00:18:11.165 --> 00:18:14.973\nnow it'll give me a little\nmore data on that package.\n\n344\n00:18:14.973 --> 00:18:17.390\nSo I can come through and\nI can read a little more on it and\n\n345\n00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.800\nfind out if that's the one\nthat I really want.\n\n346\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.790\nAnd sometimes this description has\nthe piece that I need to recognize\n\n347\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.020\nwhether this is the right package.\n\n348\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.790\nNow I use dnf list.\n\n349\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.180\ndnf list is only searching\nthe package name.\n\n350\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.490\nThere's another option which is dnf search\nand you have to be careful with this one.\n\n351\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.720\nCuz it's searching for\nkeywords instead of package names.\n\n352\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.230\nSo it will look in this\ndescription as well\n\n353\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.740\nbecause sometimes the program may\nhave some wierd crazy name, right?\n\n354\n00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.280\nI might be looking for\na text editor, right?\n\n355\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.590\nWell, the text editor I'm looking for\nmight be called nano,\n\n356\n00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.000\nbut if I don't know that it's called nano,\nlist isn't gonna help me.\n\n357\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.230\nIf I do a dnf list text, right, it's gonna\n\n358\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.480\nshow me any package that has text in the\nname, which apparently there isn't one.\n\n359\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.634\nSeems odd.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:06.740\n&gt;&gt; And you can use wild cards also.\n\n361\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.182\nSo if I do text*, it would be\nanything that starts with text.\n\n362\n00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:14.568\nOr *text*, it would be anything that\nhas text anywhere inside of it.\n\n363\n00:19:14.568 --> 00:19:18.002\nSo there's textcat and\nnow if I go a little further, there we go.\n\n364\n00:19:18.002 --> 00:19:22.860\nYou get textmerg, texttopo,\njust a bunch of different ones here.\n\n365\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.825\nSo it's just searching those names.\n\n366\n00:19:24.825 --> 00:19:28.586\nBut if I were to do dnf search text,\nright,\n\n367\n00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:34.705\nnow I get a lot of stuff, right,\na lot of things coming back here.\n\n368\n00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:39.090\nThat's usually the better option if you\nhave no idea what something is called but\n\n369\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.890\nboy does it get a lot of information back.\n\n370\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.747\nAnd some of these packages\ncan be really confusing and\n\n371\n00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:45.340\nyou just have no idea what they are.\n\n372\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.118\nAnd so I usually end up using\na combination of these, right?\n\n373\n00:19:49.118 --> 00:19:52.610\ndnf list, if I have a clue as\nto what the package name is.\n\n374\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.620\ndnf search if I don't have\na clue what the package name is.\n\n375\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.820\nAnd then dnf info to get more information.\n\n376\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.432\nNow with all of these, I keep saying dnf.\n\n377\n00:20:01.432 --> 00:20:04.680\nYou can sub out dnf for Yum and\nthat'll work on all of these.\n\n378\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.410\nSo in Yum you have Yum List,\nYum Search, and Yum Info.\n\n379\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.380\nIn fact, even though I'm on a dnf system,\nif I run yum list here,\n\n380\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.850\nif I do yum list webmin,\nwatch what happens.\n\n381\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.290\nIt says, redirecting to /usr/bin/dnf.\n\n382\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.260\nSo it just converted it right over,\nand I'm using.\n\n383\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.960\nSo you can still use the yum\ncommands even on a dnf system,\n\n384\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.120\nand you'll get the same results as\nif I had done a dnf list webmin.\n\n385\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.410\nIt pulls that same information.\n\n386\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.090\nSo these are really\ncompatible syntax wise.\n\n387\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.750\nThey're not compatible as far\nas the utilities themselves, but\n\n388\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.390\nthe syntax we use to interact with them\nis practically identical between the two.\n\n389\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.464\nSo here I can find the package\nthat I'm looking for and\n\n390\n00:20:45.464 --> 00:20:48.623\nnow I can get ready to actually\nwork with that package.\n\n391\n00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.066\n&gt;&gt; So having found the right package,\nhow do we install it?\n\n392\n00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:52.867\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nthat's typically pretty easy.\n\n393\n00:20:52.867 --> 00:20:54.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unless things get screwed up.\n\n394\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.696\nSo I can just come in and say something\nlike sudo dnf install webmin, right?\n\n395\n00:20:59.696 --> 00:21:02.208\nAnd that install is saying,\nI wanna install it.\n\n396\n00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:03.220\nSo I'm gonna run that.\n\n397\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.140\nAnd it's gonna do the install.\n\n398\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.750\nNow the first thing it's going to do\nis it's going to look for dependencies.\n\n399\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.030\nAre there dependencies that I'm missing?\n\n400\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.140\nAnd it turns out that I am.\n\n401\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.025\nI'm missing perl-encode-detect.\n\n402\n00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:14.835\nNow I don't know,\nPerl is a programming language.\n\n403\n00:21:14.835 --> 00:21:16.145\nI don't know it.\n\n404\n00:21:16.145 --> 00:21:18.525\nI don't know what Perl and\nCode Detect does, right, but\n\n405\n00:21:18.525 --> 00:21:21.355\napparently web min needs it and\ndnf was able to figure that out.\n\n406\n00:21:21.355 --> 00:21:22.045\nAnd so it says hey,\n\n407\n00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:26.155\nyou need this piece, we're gonna install\nit alongside webmin and get it in there.\n\n408\n00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:29.905\nSometimes you'll have just one entry\nlike that, and it's not a big deal.\n\n409\n00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:33.790\nOther times you might be installing one\nprogram and it has 100 dependencies.\n\n410\n00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.340\nRight, that is a fairly common thing.\n\n411\n00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.755\nAnd so now it's gotta load all these\nother packages and keep track of that.\n\n412\n00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:42.950\nAnd that's what Yum was struggling\nwith and dnf kinda fixes.\n\n413\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.250\nAnd so when I say yes to this, it's gonna\ngo in and install and there it goes.\n\n414\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.470\nNow this one's coming from\na third party repository.\n\n415\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.130\nI know that because when I look at the\nrepository over here, the dependency came\n\n416\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.560\nfrom Fedora but webmin itself came from\nthe webmin repository and that's okay.\n\n417\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.390\nThey work together.\n\n418\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.160\nDnf keeps track of all that.\n\n419\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.780\nIf I were installing something native,\n\n420\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.330\nlike if I wanted to install Cockpit,\nright?\n\n421\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.840\nWebmin, if you never heard of Webmin, it's\na web-based administration utility that\n\n422\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.690\nlet's you kind of have a, almost like\na GUI for managing your servers.\n\n423\n00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.240\nCockpit does the same thing,\nit's just another alternative.\n\n424\n00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.719\nSo I could come in and\nI could say, dnf list cockpit *.\n\n425\n00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:22.628\nAnd I'm looking for any of the cockpit\npackages that are out there, and\n\n426\n00:22:22.628 --> 00:22:23.460\nI see it here.\n\n427\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.390\nIt's just called plain old cockpit.\n\n428\n00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.850\nIf you look, there's all these other\ncockpit packages that are available.\n\n429\n00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.250\nA lot of these are dependencies\nthat are built upon Cockpit itself.\n\n430\n00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.870\nSo I'm gonna say, dnf install cockpit.\n\n431\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.958\nAnd when I go to install that, it says,\n[LAUGH] I've already got it installed.\n\n432\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:43.540\n[LAUGH] I've already got it installed,\n\n433\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.070\nso no point in installing it\nagain if it's already there.\n\n434\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.660\nAnd so that's gonna keep track of that.\n\n435\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:53.290\nSo now they're installed,\nand usually up and going.\n\n436\n00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.310\nIf this was an end-user application,\nthen now I could go and\n\n437\n00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.560\nI could run that application.\n\n438\n00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:03.380\nSo for example, if I wanted Vim installed,\nI might already have it, or I could just\n\n439\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.520\nrun sudo dnf install vim, and now when\nI run vim, it'll launch and that's it.\n\n440\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.705\nIf it's a service, though, you might\nactually need to turn the service on.\n\n441\n00:23:10.705 --> 00:23:14.586\nSo some of that stuff is actually\ncontrolled by system CTL.\n\n442\n00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:18.420\nAnd you might need to pull the status\nof webmin and take a look at it.\n\n443\n00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.290\nAnd I've got,\nwebmin that service cannot be found.\n\n444\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.330\nSo apparently it's not enabled yet.\n\n445\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:28.810\nAnd so I might need to come in and do\nsomething like system CTL enable Webmin.\n\n446\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.350\nAnd that's going to\nconfigure it as a service.\n\n447\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.640\nAnd then I can come in and\ntake a look at its status,\n\n448\n00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.260\nwhich is that it's not running,\nand I can start it.\n\n449\n00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.400\nSo if it's a service,\nI'll probably need to start it.\n\n450\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.850\nBut if it is a application,\nit's installed, and it's just ready for\n\n451\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.270\nme to run and go.\n\n452\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.210\nNow Webmin is gonna crash on me\nbecause I've got SELinux turned on and\n\n453\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.550\nit's blocking its access.\n\n454\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.900\nSo I'd need to go in and allow it through\nSELinux and all that other stuff.\n\n455\n00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.960\nA lot of applications have more that\nyou need to do, but other applications,\n\n456\n00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.640\nthey just install.\n\n457\n00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.909\nAnd you're done.\nYou're able to fire them up and run them.\n\n458\n00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:05.542\nSo, for example,\nif I wanted the VLC video viewer, right.\n\n459\n00:24:05.542 --> 00:24:08.700\nI could say dnf list vlc*.\n\n460\n00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.488\nAnd I could look, there it is, right?\n\n461\n00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:17.175\nAnd I can say sudo dnf install vlc,\nand we'll do it.\n\n462\n00:24:17.175 --> 00:24:18.925\nNotice there's two packages\nup there called vlc, but\n\n463\n00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:21.106\nit's the different architectures,\nso it will pick the right one.\n\n464\n00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:22.918\nAnd this one has quite a few dependencies.\n\n465\n00:24:22.918 --> 00:24:24.147\nLook at all those.\n\n466\n00:24:24.147 --> 00:24:27.620\nSo I'm trying to install one program but\nit's gotta install 48 packages.\n\n467\n00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.850\nI'll say yes to that.\n\n468\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.790\nAnd now it's gonna get in there and\nit's gonna install them,\n\n469\n00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.210\nall 48 of these, right?\n\n470\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.870\nAnd the cool part here is\nanytime I do an update,\n\n471\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:42.490\nthe update will grab all of these other\npackages that need to be updated as well.\n\n472\n00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.012\nAnd it'll we'll keep it up to date and I\ndon't have to worry about reaching out to\n\n473\n00:24:45.012 --> 00:24:47.330\nall of these different vendor websites and\nemploying that information.\n\n474\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.530\nSo now that it's done,\nVLC is not a service in the background.\n\n475\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:55.490\nSo, if I just go up to my activities\nmenu here and type VLC, there it is.\n\n476\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.510\nAnd I can launch VLC and looks like I\nhave to give it some network access.\n\n477\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.670\nAnd now I'm ready to place some videos,\nright?\n\n478\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.329\nSo it's really easy to get that installed.\n\n479\n00:25:02.329 --> 00:25:05.611\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if an update is out,\n\n480\n00:25:05.611 --> 00:25:09.480\nI just come in here and say dnf update.\n\n481\n00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.557\nAnd when you run dnf update, it looks at\nall the packages you have installed and\n\n482\n00:25:12.557 --> 00:25:14.151\nit looks to see if there's any updates.\n\n483\n00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:15.707\nAnd sure enough, there's some updates.\n\n484\n00:25:15.707 --> 00:25:17.818\nActually, it looks like there's\na kernel update that I need to do.\n\n485\n00:25:17.818 --> 00:25:21.690\nSo there's update, and I can apply\nthose and it'll get them put in place.\n\n486\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.900\nAll these updates are coming\nfrom Fedora right now.\n\n487\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.640\nBut you might see some coming from\nyour third party repositories as those\n\n488\n00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.890\nupdates come along and\nyou apply them right from here.\n\n489\n00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.265\nSo once that's done, you're up and going.\n\n490\n00:25:32.265 --> 00:25:34.070\nYou've got your software,\nand you're in business.\n\n491\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.490\nYou do need to remember to periodically\nrun the updates just to check them and\n\n492\n00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.580\nmake sure they work.\n\n493\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.616\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information, Don.\n\n494\n00:25:40.616 --> 00:25:41.510\nYou did a great job.\n\n495\n00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.019\nAnything else you wanna leave us with?\n\n496\n00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:46.328\n&gt;&gt; There does come a time where you\ndon't need software anymore, right?\n\n497\n00:25:46.328 --> 00:25:47.780\nI installed Webmin a second ago.\n\n498\n00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.730\nIt was kinda broken.\n\n499\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:49.980\nAnd I don't actually want it.\n\n500\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.400\nSo, I wanna remove it from my system.\n\n501\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.220\nSo you can remove software\nusing dnf just as well.\n\n502\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.123\nLet me show you that real quick.\n\n503\n00:25:55.123 --> 00:25:59.125\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; I'll say sudo dnf remove webmin.\n\n504\n00:25:59.125 --> 00:26:01.783\nAnd that's gonna reach right in there and\nlocate that package.\n\n505\n00:26:01.783 --> 00:26:07.159\nAnd notice it's not just removing Webmin,\nit's also removing pearl-Encode-Detect.\n\n506\n00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:09.716\nIt's saying,\nwe installed this dependancy for Webmin.\n\n507\n00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:12.825\nAnd now that you're getting rid of Webmin,\nyou don't need that dependency anymore.\n\n508\n00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:14.335\nSo, let's get rid of that too.\n\n509\n00:26:14.335 --> 00:26:17.435\nAnd so it's keeping track of all that and\nit'll remove it.\n\n510\n00:26:17.435 --> 00:26:21.065\nNow DNF does a really good\njob of this stuff, okay?\n\n511\n00:26:21.065 --> 00:26:22.735\nIt keeps track of it very well.\n\n512\n00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:24.535\nYum not so much.\n\n513\n00:26:24.535 --> 00:26:26.855\nYum will oftentimes miss dependencies.\n\n514\n00:26:26.855 --> 00:26:29.235\nAnd so, a lot of times with Yum,\nI'll follow this up with one more command.\n\n515\n00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:31.710\nI'll say sudoo yum autoremove.\n\n516\n00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.510\nAnd under dnf, we don't really need that.\n\n517\n00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.250\nBut under Yum, that'll look for\n\n518\n00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.160\nany dependencies that are no\nlonger attached to a package.\n\n519\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.630\nAnd it'll get rid of those and\nfree up a little extra space,\n\n520\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.140\nreduce your attack surface,\nget rid of things that you don't need.\n\n521\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.290\nSo, I don't need that, cuz I used DNF,\nbut if you do, you've got that.\n\n522\n00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.660\nAlso, I did sudo dnf remove.\n\n523\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.200\nThis is the one command that's\nactually not compatible with Yum.\n\n524\n00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.796\nYum doesn't have remove.\n\n525\n00:26:55.796 --> 00:26:57.014\nIt has erase.\n\n526\n00:26:57.014 --> 00:27:03.380\nSo I would say sudo yum erase\nwebmin instead of sudo dnf remove.\n\n527\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.743\nI don't know why they changed that name,\nbut they did.\n\n528\n00:27:05.743 --> 00:27:09.160\nBut erase is what we used under Yum.\n\n529\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.950\nSo, that's basically it.\n\n530\n00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.220\nYou can also work with more\nthan one package at a time.\n\n531\n00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.952\nSo if I wanted to get rid of webmin,\nand vlc, and nano,\n\n532\n00:27:16.952 --> 00:27:22.240\ntyping's the hardest part,\nI can do it like that.\n\n533\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.220\nAnd it's gonna remove each one of them.\n\n534\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.820\nSo, you can install more than one package.\n\n535\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.915\nYou can remove more than one\npackage all at the same time.\n\n536\n00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:28.987\nAnd that's all kinda built right in there.\n\n537\n00:27:28.987 --> 00:27:33.020\nAnd it's ultimately how Yum and dnf work.\n\n538\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.444\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job as usual, sir.\n\n539\n00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:36.581\nManaging software with Yum and dnf.\n\n540\n00:27:36.581 --> 00:27:38.857\nBecoming a Linux system administrator,\n\n541\n00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:41.529\nthere's a lot of content\nin this video library.\n\n542\n00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:42.676\nSo you'll wanna check out all videos.\n\n543\n00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:44.662\nYou'll be very glad you did.\n\n544\n00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:46.762\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n545\n00:27:46.762 --> 00:27:49.121\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always

ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.097\nwhere we help you learn where ever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:18.908\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\n\n8\n00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:23.091\nas we continue on with becoming\na Linux System Administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:26.435\nAnd the topic right now is\ncreating user accounts and\n\n10\n00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:31.050\nthe person bringing us all\nthe information we need is Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.360\nHey Don, thanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.258\nYou're awesome.\n[LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:34.237\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Zack.\n\n14\n00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:36.703\nGet ready to dive into the world of\ncreating user accounts inside of Linux.\n\n15\n00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.852\nAnd let's just start off real basic here\nwith why the heck do we even need these\n\n16\n00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:40.537\nuser accounts?\n\n17\n00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:41.214\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:44.776\n&gt;&gt; For a home user a lot of times,\nyou have a laptop or you have a desktop,\n\n19\n00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:47.020\nand you are the only one that uses it.\n\n20\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.440\nBut in a business environment, it is very,\n\n21\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.140\nvery common to have shared machines\nwhere more than one user uses them.\n\n22\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.560\nOr to have a centralized server,\n\n23\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.140\nlike a file server, where more than user\nis accessing resources on that system.\n\n24\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.160\nAnd as a result, you are gonna\nneed to create user accounts.\n\n25\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.673\nSo in this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at how to create user accounts.\n\n26\n00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:06.671\nHow to manage them,\nmodify them, delete them,\n\n27\n00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:10.060\ndo all the crazy things that we need to do\nto get those user accounts up and running.\n\n28\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.150\nAnd you'll find there are a ton of\ndifferent ways to work with user accounts.\n\n29\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.800\nSo I'm gonna try and keep this with the\nmethods and commands that are pretty much\n\n30\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.160\npresent on every Linux and Unix system\nthat's out there, just to make it fair.\n\n31\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.270\nBut do know there's more than one way to\nsolve every problem that I talk about here\n\n32\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.210\nin this episode.\n\n33\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.319\nBut basically, we're gonna take a look at\nhow to get those user accounts in place\n\n34\n00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.254\nand how to manage them as\na system administrator.\n\n35\n00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:37.810\n&gt;&gt; So Don right off the bat,\nhow do we create user accounts?\n\n36\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.506\n&gt;&gt; All right, so in real life land,\nif you were to come to me and say,\n\n37\n00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:46.169\nDon create a user account I would fire up\none of the GUI utilities usually, right?\n\n38\n00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:53.540\nSo it's like here on my laptop, I might\njust go and pull up the Users utility.\n\n39\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.884\nAnd when it comes up,\nhere I've got a nice little GUI.\n\n40\n00:01:55.884 --> 00:02:01.461\nYou can see I've got my user account and\nI can unlock that utility,\n\n41\n00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:07.660\npunch in my Password, and I can start\nadding users right there, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.955\nThat works great for me because I'm\njust on my laptop and I got a DUI.\n\n43\n00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:14.790\nBut if you're on a server,\nyou don't have a GUI.\n\n44\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.390\nIf you're remotely managing\nsomebody else's workstation,\n\n45\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.460\nyou've SSHed into their machine.\n\n46\n00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.200\nYou don't have a GUI either, right?\n\n47\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.070\nUtilities like these are not\nsomething you want to rely on.\n\n48\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.532\nInstead, what we want to rely on are\nutilities that are always gonna be there\n\n49\n00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:32.752\nthat we have access to,\nlike Command Line Utilities.\n\n50\n00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:36.808\nI'm on a fedora machine here, but\nI'm about to use some commands that\n\n51\n00:02:36.808 --> 00:02:40.600\nwork on Debian and Ubuntu,\nheck they work on free BSD and Unix.\n\n52\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.276\nThese commands have been around a long,\nlong time.\n\n53\n00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:46.110\nIf you wanna add a user account,\nit's really not hard.\n\n54\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.890\nThe command you're gonna use is useradd,\nkind of makes sense, right?\n\n55\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.780\n&gt;&gt; But wait, that's too simple.\n\n56\n00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.177\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\n\n57\n00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:54.060\nit's not some crazy acronym,\nwe've got to remember.\n\n58\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.264\nIt's just useradd, and\nthen you need to provide a user name.\n\n59\n00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:01.440\nNow when you do that, you need to be an\nadministrator, so I'm going to sudo this.\n\n60\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.953\nSo I'll say, sudo useradd and\nthen the name of the user I wanna create.\n\n61\n00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:06.934\nMaybe I wanna create a user account for\nJohn Doe.\n\n62\n00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:11.982\nSo I create user add jdoe, and I run it.\n\n63\n00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:13.150\nThat was exciting, right?\n\n64\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.566\n&gt;&gt; That's it!\n&gt;&gt; I just created a user account.\n\n65\n00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:15.302\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n66\n00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:16.660\n&gt;&gt; So\nnow I have another user on my system.\n\n67\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.130\nNow, this is not actually the most\nideal way to do it though,\n\n68\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.858\nbecause what's John's password?\n\n69\n00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:25.479\nI don't know, right?\n\n70\n00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.261\n&gt;&gt; Pudding.\n\n71\n00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.998\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is his name even John, right?\n\n72\n00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:29.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just did jdoe.\n\n73\n00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:29.771\nIt could Jim Doe.\n\n74\n00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.041\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It could be who knows?\n\n75\n00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:34.099\nSo we usually need to give\nit a lot more information.\n\n76\n00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.301\nBut technically, that's all I needed to\nprovide to get that user account created.\n\n77\n00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.074\nIf I want to give it more,\nI still use the useradd command,\n\n78\n00:03:42.074 --> 00:03:46.830\nwe just go a little more crazy with\ncommand line arguments, right?\n\n79\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.500\nSo for example, John Doe's home directory,\nevery user gets a home directory.\n\n80\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.586\nAnd when I run useradd jdoe, it just puts\nits own directory in the default location.\n\n81\n00:03:56.586 --> 00:04:01.950\nBut I can override that, I could say -d,\nand then specify some other location.\n\n82\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.844\nMaybe I have some external storage,\n\n83\n00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:08.136\nand that's where I want his home directory\nto be, so I could specify that, right?\n\n84\n00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:11.782\nPut it off, somewhere else or\nI just won't accept the default, right?\n\n85\n00:04:11.782 --> 00:04:16.430\nI can stick with that too, and just\nback up a bit and leave it off, right?\n\n86\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970\nI could do -e and set an expiration date.\n\n87\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.004\nMaybe John's a contractor and\nhe's only gonna be with us for 30 days.\n\n88\n00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:26.209\nAnd so I can pick a date,\n31 days from now, and\n\n89\n00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:29.430\nI can say that's when\nhis account will expire.\n\n90\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.183\nAnd he will not be able to\nlog in after that date, and\n\n91\n00:04:32.183 --> 00:04:33.862\nthat's the end of it, right?\n\n92\n00:04:33.862 --> 00:04:38.917\nSo I'll put in 08/04/2017 or\nsomething like that.\n\n93\n00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:45.130\nAnd now on the 4th, he won't be able\nto login any more, so I can do that.\n\n94\n00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.305\nI can do -g to specify a group and\nwe gonna cover groups in another episode.\n\n95\n00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:53.649\nBut every user has at least one group,\nyou have a total of primary group.\n\n96\n00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:55.978\nAnd then you have all of\nyour secondary groups, so\n\n97\n00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:58.000\nof which there could be a tone off.\n\n98\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.990\nYour primary group by\ndefault if I just leave it,\n\n99\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.520\nit'll actually create a group called jdoe,\nand it'll put John in his own jdoe group.\n\n100\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.982\nSo you've got the jdoe user in the jdoe\ngroup, that's kind of what it does.\n\n101\n00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:11.480\nBut I could choose to put\nhim in a different group.\n\n102\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.250\nMaybe I want him in wheel,\nif he's going to be an administrator.\n\n103\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.720\nI might want to stick him\nin the wheel group, so\n\n104\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.270\nI can give him access to suso or\nsomething like that.\n\n105\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.377\nYou can specify that right here.\n\n106\n00:05:20.377 --> 00:05:23.690\nThe lowercase g is the default group.\n\n107\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.345\nYou can do capital G for\nsecondary groups, and\n\n108\n00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:29.827\nthen specify more than one\nsecondary group if you need that.\n\n109\n00:05:29.827 --> 00:05:31.877\nWe can specify as password, right?\n\n110\n00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:35.561\nSo if I wanna create a user and\ngive them a particular password,\n\n111\n00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:37.240\nI can provide it right here.\n\n112\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.720\nSo I might create somebody who is gonna\nhave a password of password123, right?\n\n113\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.574\nSo I can specify right here in line, and\nI've got to know the negative of doing\n\n114\n00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:51.031\nthis though is that I have to type\nthe password on the screen, right?\n\n115\n00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:53.971\nAnd there's another way we can do\nit where we don't have to type\n\n116\n00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.310\nthe password on the screen.\n\n117\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.735\nSo I'll show you that in a moment.\n\n118\n00:05:56.735 --> 00:05:59.055\nBut this will basically\nassign that password so\n\n119\n00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:02.651\nthat I actually know what it is as\nopposed to leaving it blank or whatever.\n\n120\n00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:05.630\nI can specify a default shell, right?\n\n121\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.248\nMaybe most of my users\nare using /bin/bash, but\n\n122\n00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:14.257\nthis particular person wants to use ksh or\nsome other shell, right?\n\n123\n00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:17.170\nSo I can come in and\nI can specify what it's going to be.\n\n124\n00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.462\nMaybe they're using dash, and\nso I'll specify that one, so\n\n125\n00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:22.121\nyou can do an alternate shell.\n\n126\n00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:23.498\nI can specify user IDs.\n\n127\n00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:28.980\nNow the user IDs are normally just given\nwhatever the next available number is.\n\n128\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.963\nThere are times where you might\nneed to hard set a user ID.\n\n129\n00:06:32.963 --> 00:06:36.842\nSo for example, here let me do this.\n\n130\n00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:43.950\nLet me look at /etc/passwd,\nthat file right there.\n\n131\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.146\n/etc/passwd, that's where all\nyour user accounts were stored.\n\n132\n00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:50.115\nSo every user we create gets put in there.\n\n133\n00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:52.876\nAnd I'm gonna pull up my user account,\n\n134\n00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:57.988\nI mean when you look at my user account,\nsee how my user ID is 1,000.\n\n135\n00:06:57.988 --> 00:07:03.290\nOkay, so the dpezet account has a user ID\nof 1,000, that's what was assigned to me.\n\n136\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.252\nI'm okay with that, right?\n\n137\n00:07:04.252 --> 00:07:08.150\nIf I did jdoe,\nwho we created earlier, he's 1,001.\n\n138\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd if I create another user,\nthey'll be 1,002.\n\n139\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.500\nAnd so it's just going to\nkeep incrementing like that.\n\n140\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.750\nNormally, we don't care about the user id.\n\n141\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.100\nBut there are times where you\nmight care about that user id.\n\n142\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.404\nFor example, maybe I'm creating\na user account for Jane Smith, right?\n\n143\n00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:28.351\nAnd I'm gonna make her password,\npassword123 and\n\n144\n00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:31.570\nI know she is gonna be using NFS.\n\n145\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.348\nNFS is the network file system, and\n\n146\n00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:36.855\nwhen she connects between systems\nit doesn't hand off her user name.\n\n147\n00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:42.413\nIt hands off her user id, and\nif on that server, her user id is 512,\n\n148\n00:07:42.413 --> 00:07:46.200\nthen I want her user id\nto be 512 here as well.\n\n149\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.465\nI can come in and say,\nI want that user id to be 512, right?\n\n150\n00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:53.890\nThat's gonna hard set that.\n\n151\n00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.885\nI probably need to double check and\n\n152\n00:07:54.885 --> 00:07:56.540\nmake sure that I don't\nalready have somebody at 512.\n\n153\n00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.320\nOr I'm gonna really cause a problem,\nbut this will hard set that number.\n\n154\n00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.409\nNormally, we don't have to do this.\n\n155\n00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:02.757\nBut if you've got NFS\nthere are some scenarios,\n\n156\n00:08:02.757 --> 00:08:05.627\nespecially with the user account\nthat come into play here.\n\n157\n00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:08.907\nAll right, so you might need to hard set\nthe user id, we certainly can do that.\n\n158\n00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:10.732\nAnd then I'll create this jsmith account.\n\n159\n00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:12.513\nRight, so jsmith is gonna be the name.\n\n160\n00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:16.920\nSo when I do this, I'm given a lot\nmore information for that user.\n\n161\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.520\nAnd when I go and look at her information,\nand I look, here's Jane Smith.\n\n162\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.470\nAnd see how her user id was 512,\nher group id was 1002.\n\n163\n00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.060\nI left that one alone,\nbut her user id is 512,\n\n164\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.661\nand shoot, I forgot to override her shell.\n\n165\n00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:36.522\n[LAUGH] So her shell ended\nup going back to /bin/bash,\n\n166\n00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:39.320\ninstead of /bin/- is\nwhat I was going to do.\n\n167\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.950\nBut you see where each of these\ncommands actually takes effect.\n\n168\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.040\nSo useradd is very powerful.\n\n169\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.970\nWe can do a lot more with it.\n\n170\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.780\nBut at a minimum, you can just\nrun useradd, followed by a name,\n\n171\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.180\nand you just created a user account,\nit's that easy.\n\n172\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.650\n&gt;&gt; So Don, once you've created this, and\nyou have it in place, can you change it?\n\n173\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.077\nCan you manipulate it, delete it?\n\n174\n00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:00.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n175\n00:09:00.134 --> 00:09:03.360\nYep, so if I created a user account,\nand maybe I mess it up, right?\n\n176\n00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.800\nSo I was going to do a useradd jdoe,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.992\nAnd I go to add that user, and\nit's like, that already exists.\n\n178\n00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:18.630\nWell, all right, I could always do\na userdel, a user delete, jdoe.\n\n179\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.976\nAnd now I can delete that user\nright out of there, John's gone.\n\n180\n00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:21.855\n&gt;&gt; Boo.\n\n181\n00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:22.847\n&gt;&gt; Now there's no Joe.\n\n182\n00:09:22.847 --> 00:09:25.639\nAnd so if I go in and\nchoose the useradd jdoe again,\n\n183\n00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.976\nI don't get the warning about the users.\n\n184\n00:09:27.976 --> 00:09:31.522\nI do get the warning about the home\nfolder already existing though, so\n\n185\n00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:34.478\nthere were some files left over,\nbut I'm okay with that.\n\n186\n00:09:34.478 --> 00:09:38.596\n[LAUGH] But it did delete the user\nout of there, and now it's recreated.\n\n187\n00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:41.831\nSo userdel, you've also got usermod.\n\n188\n00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:46.030\nusermod modifies, so add, delete, modify.\n\n189\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.000\nThe three main actions that we wanna take\nare in these three separate commands.\n\n190\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.050\nWhich, times have changed, and\ntoday, it would all be one command.\n\n191\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.060\nBut back then, it was usually common for\nthem to separate out the commands.\n\n192\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.265\nSo I can come in and I can say,\nusermod and change the user.\n\n193\n00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:06.195\nAnd when you wanna change them, you'll see\nwhere there's a bunch of different command\n\n194\n00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:07.930\nline arguments we can provide.\n\n195\n00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.310\nSo for example, with Jane,\nnow with Jane Smith,\n\n196\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.430\nI wanted to set her shell different,\nand I forgot to do it.\n\n197\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.180\nWell, I don't need to delete her and\nrecreate it, I can use usermod to do it.\n\n198\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:25.450\nI can come in and I can say usermod, and\nthen I can use -s to change the shell,\n\n199\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.960\nor -u to change the user id,\n-p to change the password.\n\n200\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.550\nAll the stuff you do with useradd,\n\n201\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.110\nit's the same command line\narguments here with mod.\n\n202\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.200\nYou are just changing an existing user.\n\n203\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.751\nSo I can say -s, and\nI wanna point it to /bin/dash.\n\n204\n00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:44.950\nAnd then, I'm changing jsmith,\nthat's the user I wanna change.\n\n205\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:50.440\nNow, before I run that command,\nlet's just copy that real quick.\n\n206\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.030\nAnd what I wanna do is,\nI'm going to pull up her information.\n\n207\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.040\nAnd so right now,\nI can see where her shell is, /bin/bash.\n\n208\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.940\nAnd I'm going to run that\ncommand to change her to And\n\n209\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.950\nnow when I look,\nshe's got that new shell assigned, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.000\nNow, remember what I said at\nthe beginning of the episode.\n\n211\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.300\nThere are a lot of ways to modify users,\nand really, all the commands\n\n212\n00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.900\nI do in the show, there's at least\none alternative to every one of them.\n\n213\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.240\nSome of you out there\nare probably saying right now,\n\n214\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.810\nwhy didn't you just use chsh, right?\n\n215\n00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.190\nThere's the cshs command,\nthe change shell command.\n\n216\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.210\nAnd I can change somebody's shell\njust by using this command.\n\n217\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:37.214\nBut that's all it does, it just\nchanges their shell, versus usermod.\n\n218\n00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:41.880\nWhere usermod, if I can spell it,\ndoes all this other stuff too, where I can\n\n219\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.740\nchange user ID, I can change passwords,\nI can change home directory, right?\n\n220\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.050\nCan't do that with chsh, so\nthis one command is far more powerful.\n\n221\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.760\nBut there are other commands out there.\n\n222\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.820\nAnd I'm not saying don't use those, use\nwhatever you remember, that's what I do.\n\n223\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.258\n[LAUGH] If I can't remember a command,\nI'm not gonna use it, so\n\n224\n00:11:58.258 --> 00:12:01.760\nuse whichever one you're comfortable with,\nthey all end up with the same result.\n\n225\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.773\nThey're all going in and\nmodifying /etc/passwd,\n\n226\n00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:09.794\nthat's where those user\naccounts are being stored.\n\n227\n00:12:09.794 --> 00:12:13.159\nAnd so here's where I can see jsmith and\njdoe, and\n\n228\n00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:17.887\nI can see their settings,\nI can see where Jane has that /bin/-, and\n\n229\n00:12:17.887 --> 00:12:21.760\nJohn, or Joe, or\nwhatever his name is, has bash still.\n\n230\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.870\nI can see that information, and it's all\nbeing stored right here in this file.\n\n231\n00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.803\nYou could manually edit this\nfile if you wanted, you could.\n\n232\n00:12:28.803 --> 00:12:30.916\nBut if you make a typo in here,\nit's bad news, so\n\n233\n00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.098\nit's always better to use\nthe commands instead.\n\n234\n00:12:33.098 --> 00:12:36.274\nThey help to ensure that we don't\nget typos in our passwd file.\n\n235\n00:12:36.274 --> 00:12:39.008\n&gt;&gt; So Don, can we force a change, or\n\n236\n00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:43.920\ncan we make an expiration date for\nsome of these passwords?\n\n237\n00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and actually,\nwe really want to here, right?\n\n238\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.150\nThe scenario that I've set\nup is not an ideal scenario.\n\n239\n00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.220\nI assigned a password when I\nused the useradd command, right?\n\n240\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.190\nAnd the problem with doing it that\nway is that the password, well,\n\n241\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.420\nthere's actually two problems, the main\nproblem here is that I know it, right?\n\n242\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.200\nI know Jane's password.\n\n243\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.232\nAnd when we hire her, and we go through\nonboarding, I can say, hey, Jane,\n\n244\n00:13:06.232 --> 00:13:07.433\nit's your first day.\n\n245\n00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:12.170\nYour password is password123, and\nyou need to change it when you log in.\n\n246\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.710\nBut I'm kinda trusting\nthat she's gonna do that.\n\n247\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.340\nMaybe she doesn't.\n\n248\n00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.313\nMaybe she says I kind of like password123,\nit's easy to remember.\n\n249\n00:13:16.313 --> 00:13:17.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna stick with that.\n\n250\n00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:19.877\nSome people do it, it's not ideal, right?\n\n251\n00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:24.690\nSo I may want it to expire,\nso that she has to change it.\n\n252\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.130\nNow, that's one reason, is that I\nmight not trust her to change it.\n\n253\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.780\nThe other reason is that\nI know the password.\n\n254\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.640\nIdeally, only the user\nshould know their password.\n\n255\n00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.430\nNot even a system administrator\nshould know the password.\n\n256\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.140\nBut right now, I do, right, so\nthose are the two main problems.\n\n257\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.980\nThere are some side problems, too.\n\n258\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.113\nBy applying the password\nin the useradd command,\n\n259\n00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:46.840\nthe password has now been\nstored in plain text in passwd.\n\n260\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.570\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n261\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:56.380\nIf I take a look at /etc/passwd and\nI look for an account like mine, right?\n\n262\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.750\nWhen you find my account,\nthere's no password.\n\n263\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.760\nAnd that's because in the olden days,\n\n264\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.230\nyour passwords were stored\nright here unencrypted.\n\n265\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.360\nAnd so then, they moved them off\nto another file to protect them.\n\n266\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.320\nAnd so they're actually stored\nin a separate folder or\n\n267\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.660\na separate file called shadow.\n\n268\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.660\nAnd so if I look at me or jsmith,\nright, we're both there, but\n\n269\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.010\nwe don't have a password.\n\n270\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.210\nBut if I look inside of /shadow, and\n\n271\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.450\nyou take a look at my account, whoops, I\nneed to be an administrator for this one.\n\n272\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.790\nYou see deep is at colon and\ninstead of an x, you see all this stuff,\n\n273\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.910\nwhich is a hashed version of my password.\n\n274\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.539\nBut if I do the same thing for jsmith and\nI take a look at it, it's not hashed.\n\n275\n00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:43.490\nAnd that's because the useradd command\ndoesn't do encryption of any sort.\n\n276\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.510\nIt can't hash the password.\n\n277\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.790\nAnd so it's stored in plain text.\n\n278\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.880\nSo I need her to change her\npassword just to get it hashed.\n\n279\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.930\nNow I could change it myself, I could come\nin and I could say, passwd jsmith, right?\n\n280\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.470\nAnd by doing it this way,\nI can say, password123, right?\n\n281\n00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.730\nSo I'm not doing a hard password,\n\n282\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.260\nthis is the exact same password\nthat it had right before.\n\n283\n00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.064\nAnd now when I take a look,\nit's hashed in that file.\n\n284\n00:15:08.064 --> 00:15:09.386\nSo that's a little more secure.\n\n285\n00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:12.240\nBut that doesn't solve the problem\nof me knowing her password.\n\n286\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.710\nI know her password.\n\n287\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.690\nSo when she logs in,\nI need her to change it.\n\n288\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.680\nThe other problem here is,\nwhat if she doesn't start for a few weeks?\n\n289\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.130\nI gave her a really easy password,\nsomebody might guess that, right?\n\n290\n00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:30.530\nSo what I might wanna do is do\na usermod -L, capital L, jsmith.\n\n291\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.550\nAnd that's going to lock her account.\n\n292\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.030\nSo now it's locked, she can't log in.\n\n293\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.330\nAnd then I wait until her starting day,\nthe day that she starts, and I come in and\n\n294\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.020\nI do a -U, a capital U.\n\n295\n00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.900\nL for lock, U for unlock, I unlock\nher account, and now she can log in.\n\n296\n00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.440\nBut still, when she logs in, she could\nchoose to keep that same password, so\n\n297\n00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.710\nI need to expire it.\n\n298\n00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.000\nWell, there's actually a password policy\nthat's being managed for every user.\n\n299\n00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.021\nAnd you can use this chage, or\nthe change age command, to look at it.\n\n300\n00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:05.122\nIf you do chage -l, followed by a user,\n\n301\n00:16:05.122 --> 00:16:09.150\nyou can pull up information,\nabout their account.\n\n302\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:14.433\nI can see that Her last password changed\nwas July 5, 2017 that's today, right?\n\n303\n00:16:14.433 --> 00:16:16.520\nAnd then password expires, never.\n\n304\n00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.850\nPassword inactive, never.\n\n305\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.350\nAccount expires, never.\n\n306\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.560\nAll the stuff is not set, right?\n\n307\n00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.390\nSo she doesn't have to change her\npassword if she doesn't wants to.\n\n308\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.090\nWell I can change that.\n\n309\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:31.920\nI can say chage, and then from here,\nI can specify how old\n\n310\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.440\nher password is allowed to get or when's\nthe last time it was changed and so on.\n\n311\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:35.970\nIf I come in and\n\n312\n00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.440\nI say, I don't want her to have\na password older than three months.\n\n313\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.330\nI want her to change her\npassword every three months.\n\n314\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:49.650\nSo I could say, chage dash M, to set\nthe maximum days a password can be aged.\n\n315\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.010\nI'll set it to 90 days, right?\n\n316\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.150\nSo she has to change her\npassword every 90 days.\n\n317\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.453\nAnd then, I can come in and I can say,\n\n318\n00:16:57.453 --> 00:17:02.898\ndash d to set the last time\nthe password was changed, right?\n\n319\n00:17:02.898 --> 00:17:06.741\nAnd by doing that, I can come in and\nI could say something like, 01,\n\n320\n00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:08.251\n01, 2017, right?\n\n321\n00:17:08.251 --> 00:17:12.633\nSo I set it to January 1st, and\napparently my syntax is wrong.\n\n322\n00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.251\nAll right,\nwell actually I've got two problems here.\n\n323\n00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:19.212\nSo one problem is that,\nI put the date in the wrong format.\n\n324\n00:17:19.212 --> 00:17:21.513\nThe other problem is that,\nI kind of forgot to specify her name.\n\n325\n00:17:21.513 --> 00:17:22.989\n[LAUGH] So\nit doesn't know who I'm modifying here.\n\n326\n00:17:22.989 --> 00:17:25.900\nSo I need to change that\ncommand just a little bit.\n\n327\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.218\nThis is an older command, and\n\n328\n00:17:27.218 --> 00:17:30.029\nthen the old days specified by\nthe date a little bit different.\n\n329\n00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:34.963\nSo I need to say,\n2017 dash 01 dash 01, like that.\n\n330\n00:17:34.963 --> 00:17:37.408\nAll right, so I'm gonna organize\nthat just a little bit different and\n\n331\n00:17:37.408 --> 00:17:39.398\nI'll punch in that I'm\ndoing this to jsmith.\n\n332\n00:17:39.398 --> 00:17:43.420\nSo now it's gonna set it, where she\ncan't have a password over 90 days old.\n\n333\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.365\nAnd the last time she change her password\nis gonna be set to January 1st of this\n\n334\n00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:49.380\nyear, which is like seven months ago.\n\n335\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.750\nSo by doing that,\nnow when l run the chage dash l jsmith,\n\n336\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.950\nl can take a look at her account and\n\n337\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:03.341\nl can see that her password\nwas set to expire April 1st.\n\n338\n00:18:03.341 --> 00:18:06.900\nAnd here we are all the way in July,\nso her password is already expired.\n\n339\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.995\nSo the first time she logs in,\nshe sits down at the computer she logs in,\n\n340\n00:18:10.995 --> 00:18:12.923\nshe punches in password 123.\n\n341\n00:18:12.923 --> 00:18:15.730\nIt says, your password's expired,\npick a new one.\n\n342\n00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.710\nShe'll pick a new one and\nit will be stored encrypted in the system,\n\n343\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.230\nand only she will know it.\n\n344\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.780\nI won't know it.\n\n345\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.700\nI can go in the shadow file and\nget a hash of it, but\n\n346\n00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.140\nI can't find out what her\npassword actually was.\n\n347\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.901\nSo now we're safe,\nnow we're protected, right?\n\n348\n00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:33.740\nSo that's kind of a key thing there,\nand an easy way we can set it.\n\n349\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.030\nThere's a few other ways to do this, but\nthis is the way that always works, right?\n\n350\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:41.641\nThat we know is gonna be there to\nmake sure that we get a good clean\n\n351\n00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:42.869\npassword line.\n\n352\n00:18:42.869 --> 00:18:44.453\n&gt;&gt; Don, I've got a question.\n\n353\n00:18:44.453 --> 00:18:46.480\nWhen a new user logs in right?\n\n354\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.280\nWhen a new user logs in,\nwhere are the defaults coming from?\n\n355\n00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.440\nSo all these values here\nthey have defaults, right?\n\n357\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.250\nAnd the users get a home directory and\na mail box,\n\n358\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.080\nthey get all sorts of different\nthings when you create a new account.\n\n359\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.911\nAnd all that stuff has\nto come from somewhere.\n\n360\n00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:05.560\nSo for example,\nI just made this Jane account, right?\n\n361\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.810\nSo let me switch over to this root user,\nso I have access to everything.\n\n362\n00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:13.390\nI'm gonna go into slash home,\nand there's that jsmith folder.\n\n363\n00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:18.411\nAnd if I go into her folder and I take\na look, there's a bash configuration and\n\n364\n00:19:18.411 --> 00:19:21.278\nMozilla, probably Firefox or something.\n\n365\n00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:24.241\nThere's several things that already\nhave a configuration stored right here.\n\n366\n00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:25.647\nThese are all defaults, right?\n\n367\n00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:27.800\nDefault settings for her account,\nthere was the default password.\n\n368\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.010\nThere's all this other stuff.\n\n369\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.380\nThese defaults come from\na few different places.\n\n370\n00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.900\nWhen you create a user account,\nif you don't provide an option,\n\n371\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.880\nit will pull it from a default\nvalue somewhere else.\n\n372\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.970\nOkay, so let me just show you\nguys a couple of the places\n\n373\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.380\nthat stuff comes from.\n\n374\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.500\nThe first place is inside of slash etc.\n\n375\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.878\nYou'll find a file in here called\nlogin.defs, and that's the login defaults.\n\n376\n00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:54.640\nRight here, login.defs.\n\n377\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.588\nAnd if we take a look at that file,\nIn here,\n\n378\n00:19:59.588 --> 00:20:01.950\nit will have things like\ntheir mail directories.\n\n379\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.450\nSo if they have a mailbox,\nthis is where it's going to go.\n\n380\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.810\nAnd the password max days,\nthe minimum days, the warning days,\n\n381\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.980\nthis is the password policy.\n\n382\n00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.150\nWhere it's coming from?\n\n383\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.380\nThe system user IDs, and those values,\nwhere they come from, right?\n\n384\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.850\nAnd so, how did it know to give her a user\nID of 1002 until I overwrote it, right?\n\n385\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.303\nAnd so, it's using this to find it.\n\n386\n00:20:19.303 --> 00:20:24.688\nSo this is where a lot of user ads\ndefault commands come from, right?\n\n387\n00:20:24.688 --> 00:20:26.318\nDo they get a home directory, right?\n\n388\n00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:27.720\nAre they gonna have groups?\n\n389\n00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.443\nThat's the type of stuff\nthat's coming from in here,\n\n390\n00:20:30.443 --> 00:20:34.302\nthe SHA512 encrypted password, so\nhow we knew to encrypt that password.\n\n391\n00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:37.256\nAll that stuff coming\nright from this one file.\n\n392\n00:20:37.256 --> 00:20:39.860\nSo that's slash etc slash login.defs.\n\n393\n00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.512\nThat's not the only place though,\nthe useradd command itself.\n\n394\n00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:49.134\nIf we go into slash etc slash default,\nand looking there, you may or\n\n395\n00:20:49.134 --> 00:20:53.121\nmay not have this one, but\nyou may have the useradd files.\n\n396\n00:20:53.121 --> 00:20:56.710\nSo it's slash etc slash\ndefault slash useradd.\n\n397\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.910\nAnd if you take a look inside\nof that thing, and what you'll\n\n398\n00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:06.830\nfind in here are defaults that\noverride the other setting.\n\n399\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.910\nSo this is just for the useradd command.\n\n400\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.436\nAnd so, when useradd, where does it\nput a home directory by default?\n\n401\n00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:15.550\nSlash home, are the users flagged\nas inactive like default?\n\n402\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.780\nWhat shell do they use by default?\n\n403\n00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.310\nThis is all modifying just how\nthat useradd command works.\n\n404\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.320\nAnd then lastly, there's slash etc slash\nskel, which is short for skeleton.\n\n405\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.580\nAnd this is a skeleton home directory.\n\n406\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.490\nWhen somebody gets a new home directory,\nwhat it does is it copies\n\n407\n00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.270\nthe slash etc slash skel folder\ninto their home directory.\n\n408\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.490\nSo remember,\nI went into jsmith's home folder and\n\n409\n00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.090\nthere were already some files in there,\nif I go into slash etc slash skel,\n\n410\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.730\nit looks empty but let me do a dash a.\n\n411\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.250\nAnd we'll see there is the bash\nprofile and the Mozilla, and so on.\n\n412\n00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.296\nSo any new home folder is going to have\nthis data prepopulated in it, right?\n\n413\n00:21:56.296 --> 00:21:59.600\nIf I wanna change the way that users are\ncreated by default, if I want to change\n\n414\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.442\ntheir home directory by default, these\nare the places that we can go for that.\n\n415\n00:22:02.442 --> 00:22:07.010\nCuz hat's where all this stuff is coming\nfrom, each of these different locations.\n\n416\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:11.730\nOther things are just basically\ndefined as a default of the distro.\n\n417\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.140\nAnd distro can choose to overwrite\nwhatever the heck they want.\n\n418\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.500\nBut these locations I just showed you\nare present on darn near every machine.\n\n419\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.900\nSo you'll pretty much find\neverything you need right there.\n\n420\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.380\n&gt;&gt; So Don, as an administrator,\n\n421\n00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.200\nhow do we get all the info we need\nabout the users in the system?\n\n422\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure, again you probably have graphical\nuser interface utilities you can use, but\n\n423\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.760\nif you don't, there's plenty\nof command line ways to do it.\n\n424\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.511\nI've been poking around with\na past WD file in this episode.\n\n425\n00:22:36.511 --> 00:22:39.702\nI don't normally do that, cuz we have\nother utilities that help, right?\n\n426\n00:22:39.702 --> 00:22:45.349\nSo for example, if I wanted to\nview Jane Smith's past WD entry,\n\n427\n00:22:45.349 --> 00:22:49.231\nI could say cat slash\netc slash passwd file.\n\n428\n00:22:49.231 --> 00:22:52.554\nAnd then I could pipe it into grep\nto look just for Jane Smith, and\n\n429\n00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:54.660\nfind her information, right?\n\n430\n00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.670\nI can do that.\n\n431\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:00.080\nBut there's actually a command\ncalled get ent or get entity, and\n\n432\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.360\nit will let us get\ninformation about an account.\n\n433\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.472\nAnd so, I can come in and\nI can say something,\n\n434\n00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:06.982\nwell I probably need to sudo it.\n\n435\n00:23:06.982 --> 00:23:12.158\nAnd I can get ent passwd jsmith.\n\n436\n00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:16.500\nAnd so, it's saying look in the password\nfile and find the entity jsmith, and\n\n437\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.370\ngive me her information, right?\n\n438\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.873\nSo instead of using grep,\nit's finding that data.\n\n439\n00:23:20.873 --> 00:23:26.620\nAnd it just doesn't just work with passwd,\nI can say get ent shadow jsmith.\n\n440\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.749\nAnd then it will reach in and it will pull\nher information out of the shadow file and\n\n441\n00:23:29.749 --> 00:23:30.560\ngive it to me.\n\n442\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.330\nSo it's kind of a shortcut\nover doing something like grep\n\n443\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.040\nto be able to get that information.\n\n444\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.252\nIt saves me from going into slash\netc slash passwd or shadow and\n\n445\n00:23:41.252 --> 00:23:43.610\nmessing with them directly here.\n\n446\n00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.640\nWe just get the information we need and\nwe see it.\n\n447\n00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.700\nSo get ent, pretty handy command.\n\n448\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.660\nIt is present on, I don't know,\n\n449\n00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.710\nevery Linux distro I've\ntouched in the last ten years.\n\n450\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.210\nAnd so, it should be there, but if not\nyou can always install it really easy.\n\n451\n00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.550\nBut that's one way to do it.\n\n452\n00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.040\nOtherwise, you can poke around in\nthe text files and look if you need or\n\n453\n00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.220\nyou can use craft utilities.\n\n454\n00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.940\nAll great ways to find\ninformation about the users.\n\n455\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.250\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, so once again becoming\na Linux system administrator and\n\n456\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.550\nthis is creating user accounts,\nactually managing user accounts too.\n\n457\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.440\nAnything else you'd like to say?\n\n458\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.800\n&gt;&gt; There is a lot more.\n\n459\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.050\nYou can set password policies for\nall your users, you can sync things up.\n\n460\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.058\nYou might have non-interactive users,\nlike a service account,\n\n461\n00:24:23.058 --> 00:24:27.150\nstuff like that you can mess with a little\nbit beyond regular routine maintenance.\n\n462\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.260\nBut as far as the basics, what we've\nseen here pretty much covers it.\n\n463\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.900\nBut we are gonna revisit user\naccounts when we get into becoming,\n\n464\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.283\nwe're doing systems administrator now,\n\n465\n00:24:36.283 --> 00:24:40.272\nbut we'll talk about being a server\nadministrator in another series.\n\n466\n00:24:40.272 --> 00:24:41.627\nAnd we'll come back to user accounts,\n\n467\n00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:44.130\ncuz there's special service\naccounts that come into play.\n\n468\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.570\nBut as far as interactive users,\nregular people,\n\n469\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.010\nI think we've pretty much seen what's\nour day to day operations, Matt.\n\n470\n00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.590\n&gt;&gt; Don, I love listening to you.\n\n471\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.590\nYou're terrific, you make the\nun-understandable, understandable, always.\n\n472\n00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.297\nSo becoming a Linux system administrator,\nthere's so\n\n473\n00:24:58.297 --> 00:25:00.032\nmuch video content in this series.\n\n474\n00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:02.530\nAnd you want to visit all of\nthose videos again and again.\n\n475\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.650\nCheck it all out, you'll be glad you did.\n\n476\n00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.570\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n477\n00:25:07.570 -->

before.\n\n13\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.800\nNow we're gonna do groups, which really\ngo hand-in-hand with user accounts.\n\n14\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.010\nSo we're going to learn little\nbit of groups, and how we can,\n\n15\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.960\nbasically collect users together, into\nthese single entities that are groups, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.240\nmake use of those, for, well all\nsorts of crazy things, really handy.\n\n17\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.920\nSo, if you ever find yourself\ndoing some repetitious task,\n\n18\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.650\nlike assigning permissions to users over\nand over and over again, we can take\n\n19\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.780\na group and collect those people together\nand now we can just do things once.\n\n20\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.160\nGroups are really handy,\n\n21\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.220\nwe're gonna get a chance to see how to\ndo all that right here in this episode.\n\n22\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.160\n&gt;&gt; So that's basically why we need groups,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.810\nBecause it just saves you time and\nenergy and resources?\n\n24\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.780\n&gt;&gt; It's one of the main reasons.\n\n25\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.420\nSo groups are absolutely handy\nwhen it comes to saving us time.\n\n26\n00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.040\nSo as an administrator\nif I have 50 users and\n\n27\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.370\nI wanna give them all\npermission to a single folder.\n\n28\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.400\nI could go one by one and\ngive each of them permissions, right, or\n\n29\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.940\nI could put them all in a group and\ngive them permissions one time.\n\n30\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.950\nWell, that's a nice thing, that's a time\nsaving feature but there's also a kind of\n\n31\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.140\na forced requirement here because remember\nin the Unix world when we set permissions,\n\n32\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.750\nthere's really only three\nentities we give permissions to.\n\n33\n00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.080\nThere's the owner, there's the group,\nand there's everyone else, right.\n\n34\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.850\nSo there's only one owner and\nthere's only one group.\n\n35\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.730\nAnd so if I have 50 users,\ncan I even have 50 owners?\n\n36\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.380\nNo, you can only have one owner.\n\n37\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.950\nAnd so I have to use a group to assign\npermissions that way if I wanna give all\n\n38\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.900\nthese people access.\n\n39\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.360\nOr, otherwise,\nI have to use the everyone category.\n\n40\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.810\nAnd now it's not just those 50 users.\n\n41\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.370\nIt's everyone,\neven people outside of that 50 years.\n\n42\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.270\nSo there are scenarios,\n\n43\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.460\nwhen we're trying to assign permissions,\nwhere groups are the only option.\n\n44\n00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.510\nSo it's not a, I'm just using\ngroups to save time kind of thing.\n\n45\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.960\nIt's a, I'm using groups cuz this is\nthe only [LAUGH] way to achieve my goal.\n\n46\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.510\nSo those are great examples right\nthere of how we might use that,\n\n47\n00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.440\nand I'll show you some of\nthat as the episode goes on.\n\n48\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.830\n&gt;&gt; So, the next basic questions is\nhow do we create group accounts?\n\n49\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, it's actually pretty easy.\n\n50\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.560\nWe've got a couple of standard UNIX\ncommand line utilities we can use to\n\n51\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.540\nwhip these up.\n\n52\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.010\nYou might have a GUI available for groups.\n\n53\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.490\nActually I'm running Fedora Workstation\nhere and it does not have a GUI for\n\n54\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.250\ncreating groups so\n\n55\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.320\nI'm gonna have to go to the command\nline on this one no matter what.\n\n56\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.670\nBut some distros do have a GUI for it.\n\n57\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.720\nBut the command line utilities\nare pretty simple and\n\n58\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.110\nyou know they're going to be there.\n\n59\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.060\nSo they're the way that you really\nwanna learn if you're gonna\n\n60\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.200\nbe a system hand man.\n\n61\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.240\nAnd for creating the group we\njust have the group add command.\n\n62\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.770\nNow if you watched our user episode,\nthere was the user add command, group add,\n\n63\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.680\nvery similar.\n\n64\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.480\nIf you run group add you'll see\nit's got a couple of options here,\n\n65\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.630\nmost of which we don't\nreally need to specify.\n\n66\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.545\nYou'll see things in\nhere like the group ID.\n\n67\n00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:08.263\nAnd the group ID number we don't normally\ncare about unless we're trying to\n\n68\n00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:10.364\nsynchronize ID numbers between servers.\n\n69\n00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:13.220\nWe don't normally worry about it, so\nit'll be automatically generated.\n\n70\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.920\nThe password, we don't normally\nworry about a password on a group,\n\n71\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.600\nbecause nobody logs in as the group.\n\n72\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.480\nThey log in as themselves, and\nthen they're a part of the group.\n\n73\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.130\nSo we don't normally\neven worry about that.\n\n74\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.880\nWe might choose to tie\na group to a directory or\n\n75\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.060\nsomething, but, most of the time,\nwe don't need any of these options.\n\n76\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.020\nWe really just need group add,\nfollowed by a name.\n\n77\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.950\nNow, I do need to be\nan administrator to add groups, so\n\n78\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.130\nI'm going to sudo, group add, and\nwhatever I want to call it, right.\n\n79\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.500\nMaybe I have a sales team, so\nI'm gonna create a group called sales.\n\n80\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.670\nThere, easy enough, or if I'm\na marketing team I might come in and\n\n81\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.340\nsay group add marketing and\nI run it, there.\n\n82\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.748\nWe keep going on with however\nmany groups it is that we need,\n\n83\n00:03:57.748 --> 00:04:02.722\nmaybe these are job titles, right, but you\nmight be doing it based on permissions, so\n\n84\n00:04:02.722 --> 00:04:06.061\nI might say something like\ngroup add allowed to print, and\n\n85\n00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:09.020\nthese are gonna be people\nwho are allowed to print.\n\n86\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.880\nAnybody in this group,\n\n87\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.930\nI'll give permission to be able to print\nto a printer or something of that sort.\n\n88\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.380\nSo you just go through and\n\n89\n00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.850\nyou create each of the groups that\nyou need, a very simple process.\n\n90\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.306\nAnd all of these groups are being created\nand stored away in a file inside of\n\n91\n00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:28.335\n/etc/groups, just like /etc/passwd\nis where our users go.\n\n92\n00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.870\n/etc/groups where the groups go.\n\n93\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.300\nSo they're getting kind\nof tucked away in there.\n\n94\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.530\nNow when I create a group,\n\n95\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.400\nit's not incredibly useful because\nthere's not anybody in the group, right?\n\n96\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.704\nIf I were to go in and look at /etc/group.\n\n97\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.430\nAnd look in that file,\nhere's all the groups on my system.\n\n98\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.850\nAnd here's sales,\nmarketing and allowed to print.\n\n99\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.070\nThe three that I just created, okay?\n\n100\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.200\nSo that was /etc/group.\n\n101\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.060\nWell right now nobody's in them.\n\n102\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.800\nSee how it's sales followed by an x cuz I\ndidn't assign a password followed by 1,003\n\n103\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.570\nthat's the group ID and then it's\nfollowed by the people who were in it.\n\n104\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.130\nAnd nobody's in it, so\nwhen you create a group.\n\n105\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.160\nThe logical next step is to\nput people in the group and\n\n106\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.950\nwe put people in the group\nby using a strange command.\n\n107\n00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.910\nIt's a gpasswd okay,\npass wd is a command we\n\n108\n00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.120\ncan use to change somebody's password,\ngpasswd let's us change the group.\n\n109\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.030\nNow, why gpasswd?\n\n110\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.490\nWell I showed you /etc/group,\n\n111\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.860\nbut groups are actually tracked\nin a few different places.\n\n112\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.730\nIf you look inside of /etc/ /passwd,\n\n113\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.660\nwhen you look at individual users, like my\nuser account right here, dpezet, right?\n\n114\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.670\nI am in my own group.\n\n115\n00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.300\nI have my UID, my user ID and my group ID.\n\n116\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.460\nI'm in group ID 1000, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.650\nSo I can see that I'm in this other group,\nright.\n\n118\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.330\nSo groups actually participate\nhere inside the passwd\n\n119\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.070\njust as much as they do in\nsome of the other files.\n\n120\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.730\nAnd so that's why it get's kinda\ngrouped together on the same command.\n\n121\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.720\nBut I can come through and\nI can take gpasswd and\n\n122\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.530\nI can assign people to a group.\n\n123\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:28.150\nSo for example if I want to I want to\nadd a user, I would say dash a and I\n\n124\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.190\nwould specify the user that I want to add\nand the group that I want to add them to.\n\n125\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.660\nSo, maybe I want John Doe to be in sales.\n\n126\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.130\nSo, I would say dash a J Doe sales.\n\n127\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.730\nI'm going to add him to sales.\n\n128\n00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.020\nSo, now it's adding user\nJ Doe to group sales.\n\n129\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.910\nAnd then I can come through and\n\n130\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.660\nI could say, add jsmith,\nI wanna add Jane to marketing.\n\n131\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.730\nAnd so I'll punch that one in.\n\n132\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.420\nAnd so now she is being added\nto marketing, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.890\nNow let's take a look at what that did.\n\n134\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:04.980\nIf I take a look at /etc/passwd,\nand I find Jane and John.\n\n135\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.030\nThey haven't changed here, right?\n\n136\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.110\nTheir primary group is still set to\nwhat it was before, I didn't change\n\n137\n00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.770\ntheir primary group, I changed their\nsecondary group, groups their a member of.\n\n138\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.260\nAnd you don't see that here, but\nif I look inside of a /etc/group,\n\n139\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.430\nand I take a look at this,\nI can see the end of sales.\n\n140\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.190\nThere's John Doe.\n\n141\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.740\nAnd at the end of marketing,\nthere's Jane Smith.\n\n142\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.620\nAnd if I want to add Jane to\nsales as well I can do that.\n\n143\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.250\nSomebody can be in more than one group.\n\n144\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.310\nSo I might want to add Jane to sales,\nright?\n\n145\n00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:45.050\nAnd then if I go and\ntake a look at /etc./group.\n\n146\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.070\nI can see where I've got the sales\ngroup John Doe and Jane Smith.\n\n147\n00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.757\nSee how they're separated by commas.\n\n148\n00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:54.756\nYou can have a whole list of\nusers that are in that group.\n\n149\n00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:56.719\nJane is in marketing and sales.\n\n150\n00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:58.966\nJohn is just in sales.\n\n151\n00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:02.557\nSo now when I assign permissions there\nmight be things that I want marketing\n\n152\n00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:05.931\npeople to get to and there might be\nthings I want sales people to get to.\n\n153\n00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:10.218\nJane will be able to get to both but John\nwill only be able to get to the things\n\n154\n00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:12.776\nthat the sales department can get to,\nand so\n\n155\n00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:17.040\nthat is all kind of being broken\nup here by using G passed WD.\n\n156\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.213\nNow when I did that I did G passed WD\nwith a dash a with a lower case A.\n\n157\n00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:25.570\nThat is just adding a regular user,\nyou can do -a with a capital A.\n\n158\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.360\nAnd that's adding an administrative user,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.176\nAn administrative user is not\nan an administrator on your system.\n\n160\n00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:33.610\nThey're the administrator for that group.\n\n161\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.700\nAnd that means, they can add people\nto the group and take people out.\n\n162\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.820\nSo the sales department might actually\nhave somebody who's pretty savvy.\n\n163\n00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.471\nAnd you want them to be able to manage\nwho's in the group on their own without\n\n164\n00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:43.530\nbugging you.\n\n165\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.680\nSo you can add them using dash capital A,\n\n166\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.350\nand they still get added to the group like\nnormal, but now they're administrator and\n\n167\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.050\nthey have the ability to actually\nchange the membership of that group.\n\n168\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:00.900\nAlong the same lines, I'm using g past\nwd dash a, I could use g past wd dash d.\n\n169\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.020\nTo delete or remove a user from a group.\n\n170\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.590\nSo I could take Jane right\nback out of the sales group.\n\n171\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.730\nAnd when I do that,\n\n172\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.060\nnow she's out of the sales group and\nshe's just in marketing again.\n\n173\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.386\nSo easy enough to add people in and take\npeople out by using gpas wd -a and -d.\n\n174\n00:09:16.386 --> 00:09:18.610\nI always think of it as add and delete.\n\n175\n00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.310\nBut it's actually.\n\n176\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.030\nI think it's -a is short for\nappend, if I remember right.\n\n177\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.090\nBut I always think of it as add and\ndelete, cuz that's what you're doing.\n\n178\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.600\nYou're adding people to the group and\ndeleting people out of it.\n\n179\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.790\n&gt;&gt; So John, now that we have the groups\nall set up, how do we use them?\n\n180\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now that we got the groups.\n\n181\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.520\nThey don't actually do\nanything by default.\n\n182\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.315\nSo what I've done is wasted our time.\n\n183\n00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:38.810\n[LAUGH] I created the groups,\nthey do nothing.\n\n184\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.720\n&gt;&gt; Just for fun.\n\n185\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.250\n&gt;&gt; So\nI need to find out how I'm gonna use them.\n\n186\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.130\nSo I mentioned for example that I might\nhave folders that I want the salespeople\n\n187\n00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.100\nto get to and folders that I want\nthe marketing people to get to.\n\n188\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.980\nWell, I would need to\ncreate those folders.\n\n189\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.740\nSo for\nexample maybe on my storage drive here I'm\n\n190\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.420\ngonna make a directory\ncalled Corp docs right.\n\n191\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.510\nThis will be my corporate documents folder\nand I'm gonna share this folder out so\n\n192\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.800\nthe company can get o it.\n\n193\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.210\nSo I want people to be able to browse\ntrough this corps doc folder and\n\n194\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.200\nget to things.\n\n195\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.680\nAnd inside of that folder maybe I create\na sales folder and a marketing folder.\n\n196\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.790\nAnd in those folders are where I'm\ngonna put the sales documents and\n\n197\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.400\nthe marketing documents and so on.\n\n198\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.600\nWell, I'm making this stuff, so\nif I take a look at this with permissions,\n\n199\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.890\nI'll see marketing has a default.\n\n200\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.860\nSet of permissions and so does sales.\n\n201\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.555\nAnd the default permissions were,\nshoot, I'm still logged in as root.\n\n202\n00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:39.530\n[LAUGH] So, I just noticed I was\nlogged in as the wrong user.\n\n203\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.380\n&gt;&gt; Rooty toot toot.\n\n204\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I elevated to root I\nthink at the last episode and\n\n205\n00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:43.457\nI guess I just stayed as root.\n\n206\n00:10:43.457 --> 00:10:46.580\nSo whoever creates it though is the owner.\n\n207\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.330\nSo I guess this kinda reinforces my point.\n\n208\n00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.030\nThe owner here is root,\nand the group is root.\n\n209\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.520\nAnd so it's telling me that\nthe root user has read, write, and\n\n210\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.110\nexecute which makes sense right?\n\n211\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.540\nThe root group has read and execute and\neveryone else had read and execute.\n\n212\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.300\nSo marketing would have read and execute\nto marketing but they'd also have read and\n\n213\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.300\nexecute to sales because everyone else.\n\n214\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.580\nAnd that's not what I want,\nI want to change these permissions.\n\n215\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.580\nSo in order to use the group,\nI need to assign some things to the group.\n\n216\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.330\nNow to do that, I can come in, and\nyou can do it a few different ways.\n\n217\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.130\nSo the easiest way is to simply use the\nCHGRP command, or change group, alright?\n\n218\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.290\nBut you can also use CHOWN, change owner,\nand that's what I normally do.\n\n219\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.190\nI'll change the owner of a folder.\n\n220\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.900\nLike I just happened to be logged\nin as root when we made this.\n\n221\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.980\nI didn't mean to,\nI meant to be logged in as me.\n\n222\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.650\nSo if I exit out of the root user and\nswitch back to just plain old me and\n\n223\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.380\nget back into storage, I'm gonna run\ninto a little problem because that corp\n\n224\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.520\ndocs folder was made by root, right?\n\n225\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.890\nSo if I do an ls-la and\nI look at my root And\n\n226\n00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.790\nI take a look at corp docs right there,\nsee how it's owned by root?\n\n227\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.540\nSo I can come in and I can say like\nchange ownership Dpizet colon Dpizet for\n\n228\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:11.060\nthat corp docs folder and by doing that\nI just changed who the owner was, to me.\n\n229\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.920\nAnd I changed who the group was to me,\nright?\n\n230\n00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.210\nSo I'm now in charge of this folder\naltogether, and I probably should have\n\n231\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.420\ndone that with a -R to make it recursive,\nget everything inside of it, too.\n\n232\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.090\nSo now the whole thing is owned by me.\n\n233\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.800\nAnd when I go into corp docs, and\n\n234\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.740\nI take a look, there's marketing and\nsales and I'm now in charge right?\n\n235\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.280\nI made this stuff.\n\n236\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.610\nBut I want marketing to be able\nto get to the marketing folder.\n\n237\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.760\nAnd I want sales to be able to get\nto the sales folder and I don't want\n\n238\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.990\nmarketing to get to sales and I don't\nwant sales to get to marketing right?\n\n239\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.650\nI wanna partition this out.\n\n240\n00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.770\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna take away the everyone permissions.\n\n241\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.740\nI don't want anyone to\nhave access to this stuff.\n\n242\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.510\nYou've got to be in the appropriate group.\n\n243\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.600\nSo you've got to say chmod and\n\n244\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:07.710\nI'm gonna do the other,\ncuz it's actually user, group, other.\n\n245\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.510\nSo other is what I wanted to remove.\n\n246\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.520\nI wanna remove read and execute.\n\n247\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.870\nSo I'm doing o minus r x for marketing.\n\n248\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.090\nAnd then I'll do the same thing for sales.\n\n249\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.480\nAll right and I guess I should have\ndone a dash r on that as well.\n\n250\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.380\nMy folders are empty so I don't really\ncare, but if you're folders are populated\n\n251\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.320\nwith stuff, you'll want to do\nthat dash r to make it recursive.\n\n252\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.160\nAnd that way you get everything\nthat's inside of it as well so, so\n\n253\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.290\nI'm just removing the everyone\nbit from that, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.100\nSo now, the owner is me.\n\n255\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.620\nI have full access, read, write execute.\n\n256\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.430\nBut the group just has read and execute.\n\n257\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.370\nWell, I want marketing to be able to read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n258\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.910\nAnd I want sales to be able to read,\nwrite, execute.\n\n259\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.680\nSo I want them to have those permissions.\n\n260\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.910\nSo I need to change the permissions for\nthe group.\n\n261\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.620\nAnd so I'll come right back here and\ndo the same basic thing, except I'm gonna\n\n262\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:08.830\ntake the group and I'm gonna add right,\nso g plus w, for marketing.\n\n263\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.580\nAnd then I'll do the same thing for sales.\n\n264\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.430\nSo I'm giving them additional permissions.\n\n265\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.740\nNow I say I'm giving them permissions,\nI'm actually not.\n\n266\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.070\nIf you look at my list,\nwho am I giving permission to,\n\n267\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.060\nI'm giving it to myself, right?\n\n268\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:27.060\nBecause I'm the user, and I'm the group,\nand the group is what I need to change.\n\n269\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.020\nBut the permissions are set right,\nthey are the way I want.\n\n270\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:35.560\nSo, I'm going to say CHOWN and\nI could then\n\n271\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.440\nprovide the user name if I need to but\nin my case, I'm leaving the owner alone.\n\n272\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.970\nI'm just changing the groups so\nI'll say colon and then the group.\n\n273\n00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.090\nAnd so, this is going to be marketing and\n\n274\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.970\nI'm going to assign that\nto the marketing folder.\n\n275\n00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.100\nAnd again,\nI'm gonna make sure to do a -R on this so\n\n276\n00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.010\nI get everything that's inside\nof that folder as well.\n\n277\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.551\nAnd that's gonna change who\nthe group is that controls it.\n\n278\n00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.928\nYou know, I pseudoed that command,\nI didn't actually have to pseudo\n\n279\n00:15:01.928 --> 00:15:05.762\nit because I'm the owner so I'm allowed\nto change this file, I don't have to be\n\n280\n00:15:05.762 --> 00:15:09.950\na super user to do it, but I'm kinda\nin the habit of pseudoing this stuff.\n\n281\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.580\nBut, when I get this set, so I'm just\ngonna do the sales folder the same way.\n\n282\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.400\nWhen that's done and I take a look at what\nhappened, now I'm still the owner of both.\n\n283\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.950\nI created this, so\nI'll just do whatever I want, right?\n\n284\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.120\nI gave you the folder,\nI can take the folder away.\n\n285\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.850\nI need to be the owner, right?\n\n286\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:32.780\nBut on the group side the marketing group\nis now in control of the marketing folder.\n\n287\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.430\nAnd the sales group is in\ncharge of the sales folder.\n\n288\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.550\nAnd the marketing group has read write and\nexecute on the marketing folder.\n\n289\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.950\nAnd the sales group has read write and\nexecute on the sales folder.\n\n290\n00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.810\nNow does the sales group have\npermissions on the marketing folder?\n\n291\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.538\nNo.\n\n292\n00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:51.958\nThe sales group is not me and\nthe marketing group,\n\n293\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.084\nalthough you can nest a group.\n\n294\n00:15:54.084 --> 00:15:56.053\nI could put sales in the marketing group.\n\n295\n00:15:56.053 --> 00:15:58.714\nThat does work, but.\n\n296\n00:15:58.714 --> 00:16:02.239\nInstead, they're gonna fall on\nto the everyone category and\n\n297\n00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:05.850\nthe everyone category get nothing,\nthey can't see it at all.\n\n298\n00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.810\nSo now, I've separated these out by\npermissions.nd when I hire a new user,\n\n299\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.540\nso I go in and I hire Sara Brown and I\n\n300\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.700\nwanna put her in sales I take Sarah Brown,\nI add her to the sales group, and she will\n\n301\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.820\nautomatically have access to this folder,\nand she won't have access to marketing.\n\n302\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.830\nBut if Sarah is a consultant, she's\ngonna be helping out with both groups,\n\n303\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.940\nI could put her in marketing and sales.\n\n304\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.320\nAnd now she'll have access to\nboth of these folders, right?\n\n305\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.830\nI'm using the group To\ncontrol those permissions.\n\n306\n00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.160\nAnd that's really the best\nway to leverage this.\n\n307\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.630\nThat's how we can issue out permissions\nto give people access to these files\n\n308\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.300\nwithout having to go and\nmanage them individually.\n\n309\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.951\nIf we decide to terminate Sarah,\nall I do is take her out of those,\n\n310\n00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:52.136\nwell you probably just delete her account,\nbut I could just take just her out of\n\n311\n00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:55.290\nthose groups though, and now she doesn't\nhave those permissions any more.\n\n312\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.850\nThey're gone and\nshe falls back onto the everyone category.\n\n313\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.870\nMaybe we're not firing her.\n\n314\n00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.850\nMaybe we're moving her to another\ndepartment, she gets a promotion so\n\n315\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.760\nwe move her into\nthe executives department.\n\n316\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.200\nSo now she doesn't need to be in marketing\nor sales anymore, she's in the executive.\n\n317\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.870\nSo you move her over to\nthat other group and\n\n318\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:14.150\nshe now loses access to these folders\nhere, that's all a part of using a group.\n\n319\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.670\nSo I used the chown command or\n\n320\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.830\nchange owner command, but\nI used it to change the group as well.\n\n321\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.850\nAnd I'm just in the habit of that.\n\n322\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:28.101\nBut you do have the chgrp for\njust changing the group.\n\n323\n00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:30.162\nAnd so I could have said,\nchgrp marketing and\n\n324\n00:17:30.162 --> 00:17:33.880\nthen pointed at the marketing folder and\nthat would have done it.\n\n325\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.770\nAnother way I could have done this is,\nif I was logged in as a user and\n\n326\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:41.250\nI happen to be in the marketing group,\nor if happen to be in the sales group.\n\n327\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.400\nWhen I create things,\n\n328\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.280\nmy user account has well this is\nmy user and then my default group.\n\n329\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.700\nSo, my default group is dpezet, right?\n\n330\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.070\nIf I were to touch a file like test.txt,\nright?\n\n331\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.186\nAnd take a look at the output for that,\n\n332\n00:17:58.186 --> 00:18:02.980\nthe group that's assigned is the default\ngroup that I'm a part of, right?\n\n333\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.000\nBut I have secondary\ngroups that I'm a part of.\n\n334\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.460\nAnd so I might be in the marketing group,\nor the sales group as a secondary group.\n\n335\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.510\nSo as a user, what I could have done,\nis I could have said...\n\n336\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.330\nAnd this is if I wasn't an administrator,\nright, if I was just a regular user.\n\n337\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.700\nI could have said newgrp sales, okay.\n\n338\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.030\nThat's not creating a new group, it's not\nadding me to a new group, it's saying if\n\n339\n00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:30.910\nsales is one of my secondary groups, I'm\ngonna change it temporarily to my default.\n\n340\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:35.892\nAnd by doing that, now,\nI'll be in that sales group and\n\n341\n00:18:35.892 --> 00:18:41.311\neverything I do will be owned\nby dpezet with the sales group.\n\n342\n00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:44.740\nNow I'm not in the sales group so\nit's prompting me for a password.\n\n343\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.160\nAnd so I would need to punch\nin the password if I knew it.\n\n344\n00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.920\nI don't know the password.\n\n345\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.115\n[LAUGH] Cuz I didn't assign\na password to the group.\n\n346\n00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:52.480\nWe don't normally log in that way.\n\n347\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.513\nBut if I was already in that group then I\nwould just switch context right then, and\n\n348\n00:18:56.513 --> 00:18:58.900\nnow everything I touch\nwould be owned by sales.\n\n349\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.530\nNow I don't normally do this.\n\n350\n00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.960\nI don't know many people that do.\n\n351\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.411\nInstead you just do things under your\nown context and then use chown and\n\n352\n00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:07.869\nthat goes in and\nchanges that group membership and\n\n353\n00:19:07.869 --> 00:19:11.730\nit solves it there without having\nto change your individual context.\n\n354\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.706\nThis can get confusing, especially\nif you forget that you ran it and\n\n355\n00:19:15.706 --> 00:19:18.791\nthen you don't remember\nwhich context you're in.\n\n356\n00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:22.286\nchown allows you to always stay\nin your default context and\n\n357\n00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:24.220\njust override it as necessary.\n\n358\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:31.860\n&gt;&gt; Don, as a system administrator how do\nI see what groups users are a part of?\n\n359\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.180\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so\nI said a minute ago that I'm not in sales.\n\n360\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.260\nHow did I know that?\n\n361\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.580\nWell, I never added myself.\n\n362\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.470\nBut that's because I'm\nthe only person here.\n\n363\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.760\nI'm the one who would have done it.\n\n364\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.650\nBut what if you have 10 sediments?\n\n365\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.851\nWell, I might have a user like Jane and\nI don't know what group she's in.\n\n366\n00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:49.020\nSo there's a few different ways\nwe can get information on them.\n\n367\n00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.270\nThe best way is using the groups command.\n\n368\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.690\nSo there's a command called groups and you\ncan run groups followed by a user name,\n\n369\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.510\nlike Jay Smith, and it'll tell you\nthe groups that they're in, right?\n\n370\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.620\nSo I can see that Jane\nis in the J Smith group.\n\n371\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.940\nThat's her default and\nshe's in the marketing group.\n\n372\n00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.660\nIf I did the same thing for jdow,\nI can see that john is in the sales group.\n\n373\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.190\nOr if I did myself, right,\nI could see that I'm in,\n\n374\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.415\nwhile my user in weal cuz\nI'm I'm an administrator.\n\n375\n00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.765\nIf you just run groups by itself,\n\n376\n00:20:18.765 --> 00:20:20.645\nit defaults to running on your account,\nright?\n\n377\n00:20:20.645 --> 00:20:23.595\nSo any user can type groups and\nthey'll see the users and\n\n378\n00:20:23.595 --> 00:20:24.655\ngroups that happened to be in.\n\n379\n00:20:24.655 --> 00:20:27.945\nAnd they if they were to\nsay new GRP wheel for\n\n380\n00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:31.745\nexample, that will switch my current\ncontacts to using that wheel group.\n\n381\n00:20:31.745 --> 00:20:35.095\nAnd then I could go on and\nperform activities and beyond that way.\n\n382\n00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:37.300\nBut that's the easiest way to see it.\n\n383\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.340\nIt's not the only way.\n\n384\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.990\nAll of this stuff is stored in\nthat groups file, so I could,\n\n385\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.744\nwell I could do it a few different ways.\n\n386\n00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:47.360\nWe could cat /etc/group.\n\n387\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.480\nAnd pipe that into grep for example,\nand I could look in there for jdoe.\n\n388\n00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.940\nAnd I can find his information and\nsee that he's in sales.\n\n389\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.450\nThat's one way to do it.\n\n390\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.050\nI showed the get ent command in\nthe last episode, or the get entity.\n\n391\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:06.480\nSo I could say getent group and\nthen specify jdoe.\n\n392\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.050\nThat's gonna pull the jdoe user,\nbut I could pull sales and\n\n393\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.140\nthat's gonna pull the sales group, right?\n\n394\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.300\nSo I can see everybody who's in sales.\n\n395\n00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.120\nIf I wanna see the groups that a user is\nin, I'll usually use the groups command,\n\n396\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.400\ngroups jdoe.\n\n397\n00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.280\nBut if I wanna see everybody\nwho's in a particular group,\n\n398\n00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.980\nI'll usually use get ant.\n\n399\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.260\nI'll say get ant group,\nfollowed by the group name.\n\n400\n00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.310\nAnd then it gives you that whole\nlist of everybody that's in there.\n\n401\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.170\nAnd you can get an idea of what users\nyou're about to give permissions to.\n\n402\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.830\nOr if somebody says hey, I'm trying\nto get in the marketing folder and\n\n403\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.392\nit's not letting me in.\n\n404\n00:21:37.392 --> 00:21:40.720\nAll right well,\nmaybe the user is Bob Jones.\n\n405\n00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.310\nRight?\nSo, I can come in and I can say well,\n\n406\n00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.100\ngroups Bob Jones, all right?\n\n407\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.800\nAnd is he in a group that\nshould have that access?\n\n408\n00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.430\nOr, I could just say get\nin group marketing and\n\n409\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.650\nis Bob Jones in there, right?\n\n410\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.050\nEither way, either command would result\nin me finding the information I need.\n\n411\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.230\nAnd let me get in there to pull it up.\n\n412\n00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.717\nYou can poke around and passwd and\n\n413\n00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:05.920\n/etc/shadow also, but as far as group\nmembership, you really shouldn't have to.\n\n414\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.260\nIt's gonna be getent group or\njust the group's command.\n\n415\n00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.630\nYou'll see it right there and\nyou can sign the permissions as needed.\n\n416\n00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.706\nAll right, so once that's done.\n\n417\n00:22:14.706 --> 00:22:18.128\nYeah we've got our groups in place,\nthere is not too much more to it,\n\n418\n00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:20.260\ngroups are pretty simple.\n\n419\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.956\nI did briefly mention just as\nan aside here, you can nest groups.\n\n420\n00:22:24.956 --> 00:22:28.605\nSo I might wanna create a overall\ncorporate group and marketing and\n\n421\n00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:29.982\nsales are a part of that.\n\n422\n00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:32.769\nYou can do that,\nyou can put a group inside of a group, and\n\n423\n00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:37.050\nthat gives you a little more\nflexibility and granularity of control.\n\n424\n00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.400\nWe normally do that on file servers.\n\n425\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.060\nWe'll see that a little more when we\nget into server administration in\n\n426\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.110\nour next series.\n\n427\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.480\nBut as far as the basic user groups\nare concerned, and file permissions,\n\n428\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.470\nthat's how we can get them configured,\nand how we get them put in use.\n\n429\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.440\nAnd it's pretty straightforward once\nyou kind of figure out the nuances.\n\n430\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\nbecoming a Linux system administrator,\n\n431\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.720\nunderstanding group accounts\n&gt;&gt; Any last words sir?\n\n432\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.170\n&gt;&gt; Main thing is remember that groups\nare local to your individual machine.\n\n433\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.640\nSo if you've got 500 machines out there.\n\n434\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.000\nThat's a lot of groups\nthat you'd have to manage.\n\n435\n00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.190\nSo you may also incorporate\na centralized directory,\n\n436\n00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.230\nwhich we're gonna cover\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n437\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.130\nIn the next one or two episodes.\n\n438\n00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.124\nSo bear in mind that you may\nhave centralized groups.\n\n439\n00:23:16.124 --> 00:23:19.840\nBut everything we saw right here were\ngroups managed on an individual system.\n\n440\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.420\nPretty straightforward,\npretty easy to work with.\n\n441\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.460\nJust keep track of it and always remember\nto pay attention to your context.\n\n442\n00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.220\nLike I messed up and I stayed logged\nin as root there for a minute.\n\n443\n00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.510\nAnd it was messing up the context of\nsome of the files that I was creating.\n\n444\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.128\nSo don't hesitate to use the chown\ncommand liberally to go in and\n\n445\n00:23:34.128 --> 00:23:36.206\nfix anything you screw up like I did.\n\n446\n00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:38.035\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; C-H-O-W-N.\n\n447\n00:23:38.035 --> 00:23:40.322\nBeing a Linux system administrator,\n\n448\n00:23:40.322 --> 00:23:44.980\nthere is a lot of video in this library\nof information, so check them all out.\n\n449\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.170\nYou'll be very glad you did.\n\n450\n00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.440\nAnd thank for watching ITPro TV.\n\n451\n00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.330\nRemember a good

00:00:08.741\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.248\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\nwatching ITPRO.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.748\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:18.303\nMy name is Zack Memos, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:23.432\nI'm your host as we continue on with\nbecoming a Linux System Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:26.121\nWe're gonna be looking at\npartitioning disks in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:30.071\nAnd the person bringing us all the\ninformation we need is the one, the only,\n\n10\n00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:30.700\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.390\nHey Don.\n[LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now I feel like I've got\n\n13\n00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:35.045\nto live up to that amazing intro.\n\n14\n00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:35.829\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n15\n00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.000\nwe are back again with another\nepisode of Linux System Administrator.\n\n16\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.035\nAnd we're gonna be taking\na look at partitioning disks.\n\n17\n00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:45.900\nIt's a pretty important task, it's one\nwe don't perform every day, right?\n\n18\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.454\nNormally we get a new disk,\nwe partition it, and that's it,\n\n19\n00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:49.693\nwe don't mess with it again.\n\n20\n00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:52.773\nBut it is important to understand how\nto do it, how to partition the disk,\n\n21\n00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:54.779\nsome of the different\noptions that we've got.\n\n22\n00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:57.740\nThe gotchas that we have, and\nmake sure that we do it correctly.\n\n23\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.220\nBecause while we usually only do it once,\nif you ever have to change it,\n\n24\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.466\nit's actually a super big pain.\n\n25\n00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.170\nSo we don't wanna have to change\nthese things, if we don't have to, so\n\n26\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.390\nmaking the right decisions in\nthe beginning is really important.\n\n27\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.730\nSo in this episode, we're gonna\ngive you the chance to see that.\n\n28\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.514\nHow to get the foot in place, and\nhow to make those right decisions.\n\n29\n00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:15.165\n&gt;&gt; Don, didn't we, and\nnot to be redundant,\n\n30\n00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:17.790\nbecause I'm gonna be the department\nof redundancy department.\n\n31\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.910\nBut didn't we already talk about\npartitioning disks during install\n\n32\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.920\nwhen we talked about install?\n\n33\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.597\n&gt;&gt; We did, right?\n\n34\n00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:26.253\nSo during the installation episodes,\nwe did Fedora and Ubuntu,\n\n35\n00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.719\nor whatever other OS's.\n\n36\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.750\nWe saw where there was the option to\nautomatically partition our disks,\n\n37\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.900\nand that's great, right,\nyou can choose to do that.\n\n38\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.680\nOr you can manually do it, and at that\ntime I believe I walked us through a few\n\n39\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.010\nexamples of manually\npartitioning the disk.\n\n40\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.870\nBut, in all those examples,\n\n41\n00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.820\nwe're really running with just whatever\nthe Operating System was recommending.\n\n42\n00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.020\nAnd there's plenty of times when we\nneed to go in, and do things ourselves.\n\n43\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.520\nIn fact, with the installer,\n\n44\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.810\nit's only touching the drives\nwhere you're installing Linux too.\n\n45\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.010\nWhat if you have other drives?\n\n46\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.050\nRight, like my laptop, for example,\nwhere I have a 500 gig drive,\n\n47\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.550\nwhere my Operating System is.\n\n48\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.940\nAnd then I have a one terabyte\ndrive where my data is.\n\n49\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.776\nWell, during the install,\nif I pick the 500 gig drive,\n\n50\n00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:05.720\nthat's all that we're partitioning.\n\n51\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.170\nWe're not partitioning that one terabyte\ndrive, it's just sitting there.\n\n52\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.079\nSo now after the install is done, I've\ngotta come in, partition that other disk.\n\n53\n00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.670\nGet it formatted, get it mounted.\n\n54\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.080\nGet it put where we need it to be, before\nI can actually start to make use of it.\n\n55\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.640\nAnd I don't wanna throw a bunch of\ndata on there, and the decide yeah,\n\n56\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.210\nI need to change that a little bit, right?\n\n57\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.605\nSo, that's stuff that doesn't\nhappen in the installer.\n\n58\n00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:24.642\nSo in this episode,\n\n59\n00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:29.480\nwe're gonna be even moving beyond just the\ncookie cutter installation type template.\n\n60\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.700\nAnd going a little more diverse with\nsome of the options that we've got.\n\n61\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.712\n&gt;&gt; And\nthere's a couple of different partitioning\n\n62\n00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:36.829\nsystems-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean.\n\n64\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.680\n&gt;&gt; Back in the olden days-\n&gt;&gt; Back in the olden days.\n\n65\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.210\n&gt;&gt; We have one partitioning\nsystem that was really available,\n\n66\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.970\nit was the MBR system.\n\n67\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.224\nSo you call it the MBR\npartitioning scheme.\n\n68\n00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:50.230\nMBR is Master Boot Record.\n\n69\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.058\nAnd the way it used to work was that\non every hard drive right at the very\n\n70\n00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:56.633\nbeginning of the disk\nwas a little partition.\n\n71\n00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.178\nAnd I say little, it is really,\n\n72\n00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.340\nreally small, and\nit was considered partition zero.\n\n73\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.270\nAnd that partition was\nthe master boot record.\n\n74\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.710\nAnd all it did was keep track\nof all of the other partitions.\n\n75\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.522\nSo all the other divisions that were on\ndisk were kind of logged into this one.\n\n76\n00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:12.204\nAnd that's why on MBR disks,\n\n77\n00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:15.670\nthe first partition that you\nsee is actually partition one.\n\n78\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.100\nAnd normally, in computers,\n\n79\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.950\nwe always start with zero,\nthis is the one exception.\n\n80\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.040\nWell it´s actually not an exception, zero\nis referring to the master boot record.\n\n81\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.426\nSo that MBR system is what has\nbeen used for a long, long time.\n\n82\n00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:31.371\nIt was developed in the late 1970s, early\n1980s, it´s been around a long time, and\n\n83\n00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:32.017\nit worked.\n\n84\n00:03:32.017 --> 00:03:33.061\nOkay, right.\n\n85\n00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:35.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I shouldn't say it in past tense,\n\n86\n00:03:35.554 --> 00:03:39.010\nit still worked fine today, but\nit has certain limitations.\n\n87\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.572\nThe biggest limitation\nthat the MBR system had,\n\n88\n00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:44.083\nwas that it could only\nhandle four partitions.\n\n89\n00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:47.048\nWell, most of us get a hard drive and\nyou stick one partition on there and\n\n90\n00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:47.720\nyou're done.\n\n91\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320\nSo you never really run into that limit,\nright?\n\n92\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.460\nBut if you need more than four,\n\n93\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.820\nthey use this really convoluted logical\nkind of virtual partition scheme.\n\n94\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.780\nSo it would take the fourth partition, and\n\n95\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.350\nit would turn it into what was\ncalled an extended partition.\n\n96\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.280\nAnd in that extended partition you could,\nthen start to create these logical\n\n97\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.320\npartitions to get beyond\nthat limit of four.\n\n98\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.860\nIt wasn't a good system, and so\nmost people don't like to use that.\n\n99\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.217\nIf you have less than four partitions,\nwho cares, right?\n\n100\n00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:18.488\nYou go in and\ncreate what are called primary partitions,\n\n101\n00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.060\nyou put them in there and you're done.\n\n102\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.520\nAnd honestly, that works for most people,\nand so the master boot record model,\n\n103\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.950\nthe MBR model works fine, all right.\n\n104\n00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.792\nBut, by and large is being\nreplaced by a new technology,\n\n105\n00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:34.886\nwhich is called the GPT,\nwhich is the GUID Partition Table.\n\n106\n00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:39.650\nAnd what the GUID partition table does,\nis it takes these partitions.\n\n107\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.730\nAnd instead of assigning them a number,\n\n108\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.495\nit assigns them\na Global Unique Identifier, a GUID.\n\n109\n00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:49.101\nAnd because it's doing that, it's not\nlimited to four partitions, in fact,\n\n110\n00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:51.383\nit can handle hundreds of partitions.\n\n111\n00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:52.703\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Tons of partitions,\n\n112\n00:04:52.703 --> 00:04:56.303\nwithout any crazy magic,\nextended virtual whatever mess,\n\n113\n00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:58.925\nit's just used as a different identifier.\n\n114\n00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:01.399\nIt's kind of like when we went\nfrom 32 bit to 64 bit computers,\n\n115\n00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.646\nnow they can adjust more memory.\n\n116\n00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:07.685\nWell GPT can adjust more partitions,\nand so that's usually ideal.\n\n117\n00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:13.492\nThe default implementation of GPT\ngives you up to 128 partitions.\n\n118\n00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:16.490\nThere are ways you can manipulate\nit to go even beyond that.\n\n119\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.536\nBut if you have more than 128\npartitions on a single disk,\n\n120\n00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:21.581\nyou've got a pretty unusual scenario.\n\n121\n00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:24.776\nThat's really really rare,\nit gets rare to have more than two or\n\n122\n00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:26.560\nthree partitions on a normal disk.\n\n123\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.280\nIn the Linux world,\nyou might see eight to ten partitions,\n\n124\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.980\ndepending on how you divide things up.\n\n125\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.500\nBut after that,\nit's really uncommon to go more than that.\n\n126\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.200\nSo, GPT is really suitable for\nmost systems.\n\n127\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.050\nNow, if that's the new technology,\nwhy do we even care about MBR anymore?\n\n128\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.280\nThe main reason is,\nnot everything supports GPT, all right?\n\n129\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.550\nMost modern Linux distros do, so if you're\nrunning a Linux distribution that was\n\n130\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.140\nreleased in the last four or five years,\nyou're likely gonna be okay.\n\n131\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.330\nIf you're running Windows, a version of\nWindows in the last four or five years,\n\n132\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.470\nyou're gonna be okay.\n\n133\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.010\nBut if you have to support older Operating\nSystems, they may not recognize GPT.\n\n134\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.841\nThey may depend on MBR,\nthat master boot record being there, and\n\n135\n00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.790\nif they're not there, they don't work.\n\n136\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.960\nAn example of that would be like USB\nkeys that you plan on booting off of.\n\n137\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.949\nThose, typically require the MBR,\nbecause the BIOS in most mother board,\n\n138\n00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.420\njust doing the USB boot, is looking for a\nmaster boot record, not looking for a GPT.\n\n139\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.597\nAnd so\nthen we get confused what we boot, so\n\n140\n00:06:22.597 --> 00:06:24.663\nthat an example where we bump in to that.\n\n141\n00:06:24.663 --> 00:06:28.199\nAgain, at the USB key not my\ncredit at that partitions anyway,\n\n142\n00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.620\nMBR works just fine.\n\n143\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.270\nSo, that's one of the first\ndecisions we have to make.\n\n144\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.500\nAnd if you think back to\nthose installation episodes,\n\n145\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.830\nwhen I was installing Fedora, did it\nask me if I wanted to go MBR or GPT?\n\n146\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.500\nNo, it just did it, right?\n\n147\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.601\nI don't even think the option\nshows up on the screen.\n\n148\n00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:47.510\nSo it just does it,\nit sets a default based on the distro.\n\n149\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.680\nBut when we partition a disk ourself,\nwe get to choose.\n\n150\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.230\nWe get to pick which of those\ntypes we want to use, and\n\n151\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.620\nget it set the way that we need it to.\n\n152\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.530\nSo, that's kind of a neat feature that\nwe have when we do this stuff by hand,\n\n153\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.520\nand that's what we're gonna see here.\n\n154\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.560\n&gt;&gt; So, how do we use the systems and\ndo they use different sets of tools?\n\n155\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.030\nI mean, how does that all work?\n\n156\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so in this case, there are\nabsolutely different sets of tools, right?\n\n157\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.680\nWhen it comes to working with the MBR,\n\n158\n00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.650\nthe old style master boot record,\nthere's a utility called F Disk.\n\n159\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.990\nAnd F Disk has been around forever.\n\n160\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.054\nI cannot remember using a computer\nthat didn't have F Disk.\n\n161\n00:07:22.054 --> 00:07:24.375\nNow, admittedly I'm not that old, and\n\n162\n00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:27.250\nI started using computers in the late 80s,\nso.\n\n163\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.592\nBut F Ddsk has been around a long,\nlong time.\n\n164\n00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:33.950\nAnd it's designed to manipulate the master\nboot record, that's what is does.\n\n165\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.950\nSo, let me just show you an example here.\n\n166\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.245\nIf I take this system, one of the most\nbasic examples of F disk is to run\n\n167\n00:07:41.245 --> 00:07:48.690\nfdisk-l, which says, list for\nme all of my disks and partitions, right?\n\n168\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.483\nNow, every command I'm\ngonna run in this episode,\n\n169\n00:07:51.483 --> 00:07:54.539\nalmost every command,\nrequires elevated privileges.\n\n170\n00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:55.872\nSo I'm gonna have to sudo everything.\n\n171\n00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:58.059\nSo to save a little bit of time,\n\n172\n00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:02.024\nI'm gonna do a sudo-s And\nswitch over to the root user.\n\n173\n00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:04.816\nAnd we don't normally want to be logged in\nas the root user but I'm gonna to run so\n\n174\n00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:07.880\nmany administrative commands here that\nis gonna make life a little easier.\n\n175\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.520\nBut just know out there in the real life,\nin the real world,\n\n176\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.100\nyou'll need to do sudo for each of these\ncommands to elevate your privileges or\n\n177\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.060\ndo what I'm doing and\nswitch to the root context.\n\n178\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.980\nSo I'm gonna run that fdisk -l and\n\n179\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:24.580\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna give me\na list of all of the disks in my system.\n\n180\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.300\nAnd I'm gonna see quite\na bit of stuff in here.\n\n181\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.120\nAnd if I kinda scroll up,\nwhat I'll see are not just the disks.\n\n182\n00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.840\nBut the partitions inside of them as well.\n\n183\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.780\n&gt;&gt; So for example, /dev/sda is\na 256 Gig drive on this system.\n\n184\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Now this system's\nactually a virtual machine.\n\n185\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.130\nIt's running on my laptop but\nit's not my actual laptop.\n\n186\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.968\nSo this system's got a 256 Gig\ndrive that we boot off of.\n\n187\n00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:50.740\nAnd that's /dev/sda.\n\n188\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.018\nWhen hard drives are named, they're named\nbased on the type of drive they are and\n\n189\n00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:56.198\ntheir order.\n\n190\n00:08:56.198 --> 00:09:01.590\nSo, SD is telling me that this is\na standard SATA disk vs a SCSI or\n\n191\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.610\nan NVME or something else that\nwill have a different name and\n\n192\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:10.120\nthen a is letting me know that this\nis the first SATA disk in my system.\n\n193\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.560\nThey're lettered like the alphabet, so\n\n194\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.480\nthe second one will be sdb which I can see\nright here and then sdc and so on, right.\n\n195\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.450\nSo I'm seeing those disks.\n\n196\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.316\nNow this first disk is already partitioned\ncuz that's where my operating system is.\n\n197\n00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:28.591\nAnd I can see that it's got two\npartitions, /dev/sda1/dev/sda2.\n\n198\n00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.730\nNotice that the partitions\ndon't start with sda0.\n\n199\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.580\nThey go sda1, sda2 and\n\n200\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.680\nthat's because 0 is that kind of\ntie in to the master boot record.\n\n201\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.940\nIt's kind of already taken right?\n\n202\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.610\nBut that's where my Linux\noperating system is and\n\n203\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.380\nI'm using the logical volume manager LVM.\n\n204\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.720\nAnd so LVM is taking up\nthe whole rest of that drive.\n\n205\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.370\nNow LVM is weird,\ncuz it creates these logical volumes.\n\n206\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.310\nAnd if I scroll way down\nhere to the bottom,\n\n207\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.990\nyou'll see these\n/dev/mapper/fedora-root or fedora-swap.\n\n208\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.310\nThat's the logical volume\nmanager doing its thing.\n\n209\n00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.120\nWe're gonna do a separate\nepisode just on the logical\n\n210\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.800\nvolume manager-\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n211\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.020\n&gt;&gt; Cuz not everybody uses it but we'll\nexplain all of that in the LVM episode.\n\n212\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.342\nSo for now, I'm going to\nSelectively ignore that output.\n\n213\n00:10:11.342 --> 00:10:11.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.330\n&gt;&gt; And\ngo back up here to these other ones.\n\n215\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.360\nSo what I'm looking at here\nare the partitions on the disk, right?\n\n216\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.410\nOr the lack of partitions,\nlike /dev/sdb has no partitions on it,\n\n217\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.480\nit's completely empty right now, okay?\n\n218\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.590\nBut I can see the disk, and\n\n219\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.685\nI can see data about it that we used to\ncare about a lot but now we don't so much.\n\n220\n00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:35.520\nThings like how many sectors it has and\nwhat the IO size is and so on.\n\n221\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.380\nWe see a lot of that information.\n\n222\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.170\nNotice how I keep saying it's\na 500 gig disk and it is.\n\n223\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.700\nBut when I look it's actually showing\na byte number that's very different right.\n\n224\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.140\nIt's showing that it's\nactually 536 gigs in size.\n\n225\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.890\nThere's actually a discrepancy in\nthe way the drives are measured and\n\n226\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.550\nso, at the hard drive factory,\n\n227\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.800\nthat's where they do the most\naccurate measurement of the disk.\n\n228\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.500\nAnd they're showing how many\nbytes fit on that disk, and\n\n229\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.760\nconverting it to a larger\nvalue to reflect to you.\n\n230\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.680\nWhat happens is,\nwhen we think about a gigabyte.\n\n231\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.720\nWhat is a gigabyte?\n\n232\n00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.180\nIt's a thousand megabytes, right?\n\n233\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.230\nWhen actually isn't.\n\n234\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.120\nIt's actually 1024 megabytes, right?\n\n235\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.890\nAnd if we don't take in that extra little\n24, the numbers start to get off and\n\n236\n00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.020\nthey get skewed.\n\n237\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.260\nAnd so, for\na 500 gig disc to actually be 500 gigs,\n\n238\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.980\nit has to be 536 Gigs,\n\n239\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.410\nto accommodate for that 1024 as opposed to\n1000 that's pretty serious discrepancies.\n\n240\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.690\nF disk, picks up on that.\n\n241\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.750\nWe see it here, right?\n\n242\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.320\nCause it's a really low level\nutility that digs in deep.\n\n243\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.280\nAnd with F disk we can't, we're not just\nlimited here to seeing things, we can\n\n244\n00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.450\nactually get in and create partitions and\nmake these discs where they're usable.\n\n245\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.890\nWe can't use a disk\nthat's completely blank.\n\n246\n00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.970\nWe have to put at least one\npartition on it to make use of it.\n\n247\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.940\nAnd with F disk there's a few\nways that you can use it.\n\n248\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.980\nBut the easiest way is to come in and\njust say,\n\n249\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.240\nF disk followed by the name of\nthe disk that you want to edit.\n\n250\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.070\nSo I want to edit /dev/sdb, right?\n\n251\n00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.380\nNow I'm not putting\na partition number on there.\n\n252\n00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.510\nEven if partitions existed\nI would leave that off.\n\n253\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.930\nI'm referring to the drive itself,\nso /dev/sdb.\n\n254\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:23.940\nAnd when I run that I get this\namazing interface, right?\n\n255\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.770\nIt's all text based.\n\n256\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.530\nThis is all old school, right?\n\n257\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.650\nSo no graphics.\n\n258\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.980\nNo crazy ASCII art or anything like that.\n\n259\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.830\nWe just go in, we get a command line and\nit says press m for help.\n\n260\n00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.120\nAnd if we do the m, you'll see all\nthe different things that we can do.\n\n261\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.870\nBut I'll be honest with you,\n\n262\n00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.940\nthere's really only a couple letters\nthat we care about n, p and w.\n\n263\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.750\nThose three are the main ones\nthat we're going to use and\n\n264\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.190\neach one does something\na little bit different.\n\n265\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.470\nSo for example,\np prints the partition table.\n\n266\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.740\nF disk-l was showing me all\nthe disks in the system.\n\n267\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.160\nBut now I picked a particular disk, and\n\n268\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.030\nif I do p, it's gonna show me\nthe partitions just for this disk.\n\n269\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.620\nBut it's the same output as I would\nhave seen from the command line.\n\n270\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.270\nIt's just limited now to one disk and\nI can see I've got no partitions.\n\n271\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.750\nRight, so\nthat's where the next command comes in, N.\n\n272\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.130\nN lets me create a new partition.\n\n273\n00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.280\nSo I can hit N, and\nI'm going to create a new one.\n\n274\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.290\nAnd it's going to ask me\na few questions about it.\n\n275\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.900\nIs this a primary partition,\nor an extended?\n\n276\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.000\nRight, if' I'm only going\nto have four partitions, or\n\n277\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.830\nless than four, I'll do all primaries.\n\n278\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.520\nBut if I'm going to have more than four,\nI'll do three primaries and\n\n279\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.370\nthe fourth one will be an extended.\n\n280\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.350\nAnd in that fourth one will contain\nother logical partitions we need to\n\n281\n00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.090\nfind that from here.\n\n282\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.250\nSo we just kind of go as we need it but\nin my case I'm going to do a primary.\n\n283\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.800\nSee how it says zero,\nprimary zero extended for free right?\n\n284\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.260\nThat's how I know I'm working in the MBR\nworld, the Master Boot Record world.\n\n285\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.690\nAnd so I'm just going to\ncreate a primary partition.\n\n286\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.050\nAnd it's asking me a petition number,\n\n287\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.610\n1 through 4 and you typically start at the\nbeginning so I'll do petition number 1.\n\n288\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.240\nAnd then the size.\n\n289\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.320\nNow the size is a little annoying because\nit's doing it based on sectors, right?\n\n290\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.850\nNotice how the sector starts at 2048.\n\n291\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.800\nThat's because the map to boot\nrecord needs the very beginning.\n\n292\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.720\nSo it's occupying the first\nlittle part of the hard drive and\n\n293\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.220\nthen after that it's asking\nme where we want to start.\n\n294\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.990\nWell, normally you want to\nstart right at the beginning.\n\n295\n00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.230\nYou're gonna fill the disk but\n\n296\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.130\nthere are times where you might wanna\nleave a gap before a partition,\n\n297\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.770\nmaybe you're gonna use it for\nswap later on or something like that.\n\n298\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.020\nAnd so I can come in,\nand designate that here.\n\n299\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.850\nIf you just press enter,\nit'll take that very first sector.\n\n300\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.360\nNow, the hard part, we have to\nspecify how big we want the partition.\n\n301\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.230\nAnd in older versions of this was\nall built around the sectors.\n\n302\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.310\nAnd so you had to break out a calculator\nand figure out how big each sector was.\n\n303\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.910\nAnd you'd go through all this mess.\n\n304\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.720\nWell now we can actually\nenter things in by size.\n\n305\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.300\nAnd so if I want to create a 100 megabyte\npartition or a 10 gigabyte partition,\n\n306\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.610\nright, I can just come in here and\nsay, plus size and\n\n307\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.070\nthen tell it what I want that size to be.\n\n308\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.540\nSo I might say, actually you don't\nsay size, you just say plus, and\n\n309\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.390\nthen you say something like 300 G for\n300 gigabytes,\n\n310\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:05.360\nor I'll do 100, so +100G,\nlike that, all right.\n\n311\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.010\nAnd it will calculate how\nmany sectors we need.\n\n312\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.880\nIf I don't do this, if I just press Enter,\nit will take up the whole disk.\n\n313\n00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.380\nIf I just want to create one\npartition across this whole disk,\n\n314\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.500\nthat's the easiest thing.\n\n315\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.668\nAnd we can do it and it'll be done,\nbut I'll say plus 100g and\n\n316\n00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.440\nit's going to go ahead and do that.\n\n317\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.004\nIt calculates out the sectors for\nme, and if I hit p,\n\n318\n00:15:24.004 --> 00:15:26.758\nI can take a look at it and\nthere it is, and\n\n319\n00:15:26.758 --> 00:15:31.630\nI see that it starts at 2048 and\nends at I don't know, what is that?\n\n320\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:37.120\n209,717,247, we could've figured that\nout eventually with a little leg work.\n\n321\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.650\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n322\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.660\n&gt;&gt; But this was much easier.\n\n323\n00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.527\n&gt;&gt; Do that standing on my head.\n\n324\n00:15:41.527 --> 00:15:42.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n325\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.390\nif I'm intending to write\nto this partition and\n\n326\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.280\nuse it for regular stuff,\nI'm kind of done at this point, right?\n\n327\n00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.800\nJust created a Linux partition.\n\n328\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.340\nBut if I want to use this for\n\n329\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.416\na swap file, or something,\nI might need to change this type, okay?\n\n330\n00:15:55.416 --> 00:15:57.188\nThese last two columns here, ID and type,\n\n331\n00:15:57.188 --> 00:15:59.512\nare defining what I'm going\nto use that partition for.\n\n332\n00:15:59.512 --> 00:16:02.102\nAnd if you look at your help screen.\n\n333\n00:16:02.102 --> 00:16:05.990\nYou'll see in here where you've\ngot the option to change\n\n334\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.935\nthe type of that partition.\n\n335\n00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:09.350\nIs it t?\nYeah, it's t, all right.\n\n336\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.210\nSo we've got t, change partition type.\n\n337\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.617\nAnd so I can come in, and I can say t.\n\n338\n00:16:13.617 --> 00:16:17.060\nAnd I can change the partition\ntype to something else.\n\n339\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.810\nWell if you do an l here,\nyou can get the full list.\n\n340\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.270\nThere's a lot of partition types.\n\n341\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.600\nBut in the Linux world,\nwe're normally using 83 for the Linux OS.\n\n342\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.573\nAnd then the Linux swap which is, I think,\n82, which scrolled off my screen.\n\n343\n00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:32.990\nYeah, 82, 82 is Linux swap.\n\n344\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.420\nAnd so we can pick 82 or 83.\n\n345\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.950\nBut you'll see, all these other operating\nsystems have different partition types.\n\n346\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.540\nAnd so you could flag it for\nsomething completely different.\n\n347\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.554\nA lot of these companies aren't\neven in business anymore, like Dr.\n\n348\n00:16:43.554 --> 00:16:44.330\nDOS, those are gone.\n\n349\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.530\nSolaris is gone, or effectively gone.\n\n350\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.050\nSo you've got some of those, but many of\nthem are still around, like Windows, and\n\n351\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.940\nso you can designate them if needed.\n\n352\n00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.840\nIn my case,\nI don't actually want to change it.\n\n353\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.420\nSo I'll just leave it at 83,\nand there it is, okay?\n\n354\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.100\nSo at this point,\nI've created a single partition.\n\n355\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.670\nAnd I could go on and create more, right?\n\n356\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.310\nJust by hitting n, and\ncreating more partitions.\n\n357\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.810\nSo you just kinda run through\nthat same process, and\n\n358\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.250\ndesignate what you're trying to create.\n\n359\n00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.555\nI'll do a 500 meg partition.\n\n360\n00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:16.340\nSo now got a second one, all right?\n\n361\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.780\nNow everything I've done so far,\nhas only been done in memory.\n\n362\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.820\nIt hasn't actually touched the disk yet.\n\n363\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.980\nAnd that's the last command that I wanna\nmention, that's really important, is w.\n\n364\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.750\nWe need to write the changes to the disk,\nokay?\n\n365\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.950\nWe're gonna write them down, and\nnow it's changing the disk, all right?\n\n366\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.900\nSo the main commands to remember are p,\nn, w.\n\n367\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.930\nP to print the table, n to create\na new partition, w to write the table.\n\n368\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.900\nMaybe remember t, if you need it,\nto change your partition type.\n\n369\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.200\nBut for the most part, p, n,\nw are commands that we need to know.\n\n370\n00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.910\nAnd once it's done,\nnow I've partitioned this disk, and\n\n371\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.460\ndivided it up into separate virtual disks.\n\n372\n00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat was an example of the MBR, right?\n\n373\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So what about the GPT?\n\n374\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so GPT is much,\nmuch newer, right?\n\n375\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.300\nGPT hasn't been around all that long,\nless than ten years.\n\n376\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.890\nBut it's definitely catching on.\n\n377\n00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.266\nIt's going to replace MBR in the long run.\n\n378\n00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:13.000\nIt's already replaced it in most places.\n\n379\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.560\nSo if we wanna work with GPT,\nthere are other tools we can use.\n\n380\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.670\nSome that are easier.\n\n381\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.200\nBut they created a utility called gdisk.\n\n382\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.970\nNow, I just used fdisk, right?\n\n383\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:29.080\ngdisk is basically the same thing,\nexcept it's for GPT, right?\n\n384\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.880\nSo now I can start to work with GPT disks.\n\n385\n00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.820\nAnd they tried to make it as\ncompatible as possible with fdisk, so\n\n386\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.680\nthat you didn't have to\nrelearn a whole lot.\n\n387\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.946\nIt is a new utility, but I can run gdisk\n-l, and it'll try and give me a listing.\n\n388\n00:18:41.946 --> 00:18:44.610\nI'll say, there's not much in here.\n\n389\n00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.360\nLet me just run gdisk by itself.\n\n390\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.033\nAnd when you run gdisk, it's prompting\nme for which disk I wanna access.\n\n391\n00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:54.977\nSo maybe I wanna do /dev/sdc, okay?\n\n392\n00:18:54.977 --> 00:18:59.170\nAnd once I get in there, see how it's\ntelling me there's no master boot record?\n\n393\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:18:59.980\nThere's no GPT.\n\n394\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.280\nThere's nothing present on this disk.\n\n395\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.060\nAnd I can press question for help.\n\n396\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.040\nAnd when you look at\nthe help options in gdisk,\n\n397\n00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.970\nyou should notice\nsomething pretty familiar.\n\n398\n00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.440\nRemember the commands I told\nyou to remember for fdisk?\n\n399\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.020\nP for print partition table, n for\n\n400\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:18.235\nadd a new one, w for write,\nt for changing the type?\n\n401\n00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:19.840\nThey're all the same, right?\n\n402\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.090\nSo if you know how to use fdisk,\nyou know how to use gdisk.\n\n403\n00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.190\ngdisk, we can say p, and\nit'll print the table.\n\n404\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.070\nRight now there's nothing on that disk.\n\n405\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.880\nI can say n,\nI want to create a new partition.\n\n406\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.020\nAnd notice the partition number,\nit's not 1 through 4 anymore.\n\n407\n00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.740\nIt's 1 through 128.\n\n408\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.370\nAnd it's not asking me if I want\nto do a extended partition, or\n\n409\n00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.380\na primary,\nbecause they're all the same under GPT.\n\n410\n00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.210\nSo I can create one.\n\n411\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.080\nI'll do number 1.\n\n412\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.000\nAnd then the first sector, it's asking\nme where I want to start it at.\n\n413\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.910\nI'll start it at the beginning.\n\n414\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.887\nAnd then the last sector,\nand what did I do before?\n\n415\n00:19:54.887 --> 00:19:55.873\nI did a 100 gig drive?\n\n416\n00:19:55.873 --> 00:19:57.087\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did a 100 gig.\n\n417\n00:19:57.087 --> 00:19:58.705\n&gt;&gt; So I'll do the same thing here.\n\n418\n00:19:58.705 --> 00:20:03.782\nI'm gonna say +100G, and\nwe'll punch that in.\n\n419\n00:20:03.782 --> 00:20:07.100\nAnd it's setting that current\ntype to the Linux file system.\n\n420\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.110\nI can change it if I need to,\nor I'll leave it.\n\n421\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.460\nI can do l to show the code.\n\n422\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.562\nThis is a little bit different.\n\n423\n00:20:11.562 --> 00:20:14.339\nIt's giving me the chance to\nchange the type right here, and\n\n424\n00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.473\nnot have to come back in\nwith a t command later.\n\n425\n00:20:16.473 --> 00:20:18.310\nBut I'll go ahead and run that.\n\n426\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.590\nAnd I'll create another one,\ncuz I also created a, what was it,\n\n427\n00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.350\na 300 meg partition I think\nwas the other one I did?\n\n428\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.750\nI can probably just scroll back here and\nfind out.\n\n429\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.470\nMy memory doesn't go back that far.\n\n430\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.760\nIt was, 500 megs.\n\n431\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.385\nSo, I'll create another one here,\na new partition.\n\n432\n00:20:32.385 --> 00:20:36.270\nThis will be partition number 2,\nand I'll do +500 megs on this one.\n\n433\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.020\nAnd we'll, oops, shoot.\n\n434\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.766\nI made a mistake, right?\n\n435\n00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:40.280\n&gt;&gt; So I made a mistake.\n\n436\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.600\nI did +500M for where I wanna start.\n\n437\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.918\nI wanted to do this at the end, and\n\n438\n00:20:44.918 --> 00:20:48.845\nthat's a problem cause that's gonna cause\nsome overlap with what I've already got.\n\n439\n00:20:48.845 --> 00:20:51.455\nSo what I'm gonna do here,\nis kinda print that out, and\n\n440\n00:20:51.455 --> 00:20:53.815\nsee how it messed it up a little bit?\n\n441\n00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:57.315\nI have my 100 gig partition, but\nI was trying to create a 500 meg, and\n\n442\n00:20:57.315 --> 00:20:58.675\nnow things are messed up.\n\n443\n00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.395\nSo I can fix that pretty easily.\n\n444\n00:21:00.395 --> 00:21:03.025\nRemember, I haven't actually\nwritten anything to disk.\n\n445\n00:21:03.025 --> 00:21:03.615\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n446\n00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:06.150\n&gt;&gt; If I quit out of this utility,\nall of this goes away.\n\n447\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.090\nOr, I could delete.\n\n448\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.580\nAnd I haven't really talked about that,\nbut you've got d for delete.\n\n449\n00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.490\nAnd I can just delete partition 2,\nand then I can do it again and\n\n450\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.710\nnot screw it up this time.\n\n451\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.550\nSo, now I can come in here, and\nI'll accept the default for the beginning.\n\n452\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:22.260\nAnd here's where I wanna do +500M,\nand we'll do that.\n\n453\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.110\nAnd now, I've got that file system\ncreated with a 100 gig partition, and\n\n454\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.470\na 500 meg partition, and there they are.\n\n455\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.050\nI can do w to write them.\n\n456\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.329\nI'll go ahead and do that.\n\n457\n00:21:32.329 --> 00:21:33.200\nAnd it's gonna write them down.\n\n458\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.630\nAnd now /dev/stc/ is using GPT.\n\n459\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.119\nsdb is using MBR, this one is using GPT.\n\n460\n00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:43.830\nOnce they're partitioned,\nwe kinda treat them the same.\n\n461\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.140\nBut that setup part really\nwasn't any harder, right?\n\n462\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.957\nSo gdisk and fdisk, fdisk for\nMBR, gdisk for GPT.\n\n463\n00:21:51.957 --> 00:21:54.520\nOtherwise, the syntax is identical.\n\n464\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.564\n&gt;&gt; Now, these tools are kind\nof from the olden days.\n\n465\n00:21:57.564 --> 00:22:00.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is there something\nkind of newer that we could use,\n\n466\n00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.655\nsomething more up to date,\nstate-of-the-art?\n\n467\n00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:04.885\n&gt;&gt; There are.\n\n468\n00:22:04.885 --> 00:22:07.115\nThese two tools are ones you can count on.\n\n469\n00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:08.365\nYou know they're gonna be there, right?\n\n470\n00:22:08.365 --> 00:22:10.085\nYou don't have to install them.\n\n471\n00:22:10.085 --> 00:22:14.105\nBut if you've got\na fully-featured Linux install.\n\n472\n00:22:14.105 --> 00:22:16.095\nSo not a minimal install,\nbut a fully featured one,\n\n473\n00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:18.003\nyou probably have a couple\nof other utilities.\n\n474\n00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.145\nFor example, there's the parted utility.\n\n475\n00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:23.710\nParted is another command line\nutility that you can run,\n\n476\n00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.880\nthat is a little bit more powerful\nthan what we saw with fdisk and gdisk.\n\n477\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.020\nAnd so it can actually do both GPT and\nMBR from inside of one utility.\n\n478\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.370\nThe commands are a lot more complex,\nright?\n\n479\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.110\nSo if you look here,\nthere's a lot more options in here.\n\n480\n00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.390\nBut it has some fancy features,\n\n481\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:45.080\nlike being able to resize partitions, and\nyou can't do that in fdisk and gdisk.\n\n482\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.810\nSo this is more feature rich.\n\n483\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.340\nMuch more powerful.\n\n484\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.700\nStill command line based,\nbut much more powerful.\n\n485\n00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.859\nNow, what I like to use, and\nwhat I'll use when I'm not on air,\n\n486\n00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:56.568\nis none of these, right?\n\n487\n00:22:56.568 --> 00:22:58.933\nCuz command line can be kind\nof annoying with this stuff.\n\n488\n00:22:58.933 --> 00:23:00.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's a graphical utility.\n\n489\n00:23:00.147 --> 00:23:03.180\nThere's actually a couple of\ngraphical utilities we can use.\n\n490\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.650\nNot so good on servers, right?\n\n491\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.540\nBut on workstations,\nthe graphical utilities are great.\n\n492\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.000\nIf you've got the Gnome Window Manager,\n\n493\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.370\nwhich most people do, Gnome actually has a\nutility called Disks built right into it.\n\n494\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:19.280\nAnd if I fire up Disks,\nI can see all the disks on my system.\n\n495\n00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.733\nIncluding the ones that we\njust formatted out, and\n\n496\n00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.024\nother ones that I haven't\neven formatted yet.\n\n497\n00:23:24.024 --> 00:23:25.445\nSo let me zoom in on some of this.\n\n498\n00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:29.059\nSo here's a 537 gig disk, right?\n\n499\n00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.160\nSo it's actually showing that full size.\n\n500\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.872\nAnd I can see the partitions here, the 107\ngig, and the 500 gig partition, right?\n\n501\n00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:38.970\nOr sorry, no, there's 100 gig and 500 meg.\n\n502\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.077\nThose are the two partitions I made.\n\n503\n00:23:41.077 --> 00:23:42.025\nThis is the one that's MBR.\n\n504\n00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:44.080\nSee how it says Master Boot Record?\n\n505\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.100\nBut if I take a look at my next disk,\nit shows GUID Partition Table,\n\n506\n00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.740\nand there's 100 gig and\na 500 meg partition sitting right there.\n\n507\n00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.410\nWell, I can use this utility to go and\ntake another disk, like this one,\n\n508\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.046\nand I can partition it, right?\n\n509\n00:23:59.046 --> 00:24:02.264\nI can create partitions, delete,\nwhatever it is that I wanna do.\n\n510\n00:24:02.264 --> 00:24:05.910\nI can initialize the disk, which is\nwhat it's wanting me to do right now.\n\n511\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.138\nI can format it out.\n\n512\n00:24:07.138 --> 00:24:11.420\nWe can just choose this graphical utility,\nand that takes care of that.\n\n513\n00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.220\nThis one's built into GNOME so\nthe odds are you have it.\n\n514\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.710\nThere is another one you can\ninstall though that's even better.\n\n515\n00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.584\nCalled gpart-ed.\n\n516\n00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:22.180\nPart-ed that I showed you a moment\nago is a command line utility.\n\n517\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.227\n&gt;&gt; Some people refer to\nthat as parted right?\n\n518\n00:24:23.227 --> 00:24:24.008\nThey just say parted?\n\n519\n00:24:24.008 --> 00:24:24.666\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n520\n00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:26.322\nPartition editor is what it's short for.\n\n521\n00:24:26.322 --> 00:24:26.833\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n522\n00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:27.729\n&gt;&gt; Either way it works.\n\n523\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.910\nG part ed,\nis a graphical partition editor,\n\n524\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.750\nit's really the same part ed utility but\nwith a GUI stuck on it.\n\n525\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.400\nAnd so when you launch that, this thing is\nreally slick, this is my preferred method.\n\n526\n00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.310\nIf I have it available this is what I use\nbecause when you go into g part ed you get\n\n527\n00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:50.149\nthis nice graphical interface and\nyou can come in, and you can see the disk,\n\n528\n00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:54.328\nyou can just click on things,\ncreate partitions, resize them.\n\n529\n00:24:54.328 --> 00:24:58.259\nIt works with Linux partitions as\nwell as Windows partitions and\n\n530\n00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:01.038\njust all sorts of really\ninteresting stuff.\n\n531\n00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:06.390\nIt is a really just cool utility that\ndoes make life a lot easier for you.\n\n532\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.920\nAnd you can come in and choose to\ncreate a partition table as GPT or MBR,\n\n533\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.510\nyou can resize,\nyou can back up partitions.\n\n534\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.370\nIt's all done right here through a GUI.\n\n535\n00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.950\nIf I wanna switch disks,\nit's just a drop down box over here, and\n\n536\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.600\nI pick the disk I wanna mess with.\n\n537\n00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.940\nAnd off I go.\n\n538\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.050\nI can create a new partition and\n\n539\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.670\nhere it's just warning me I don't\nhave a partition table on here yet.\n\n540\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.490\nSo I need to initialize it.\n\n541\n00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.620\nBut once we get all this set up,\nthen it's done.\n\n542\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.190\nIt's easy to work with\nright here in the GUI.\n\n543\n00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.270\nIt is a little heavy on the resources as\nfar as like all of the dependencies you\n\n544\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:34.820\nhave to install.\n\n545\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.380\nSo again, on a server,\nthat's not really ideal.\n\n546\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.130\nOn a server,\nwe want to use the command line utilities.\n\n547\n00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.570\nThey're a lot more lightweight.\n\n548\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.810\nBut on a workstation,\nI usually use gparted.\n\n549\n00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:44.990\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n550\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.070\nWell, gosh, we're almost at the end\nof this episode, aren't we?\n\n551\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.920\nAny more things you wanna cover or?\n\n552\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's not too much else,\nI guess let me just show real quick.\n\n553\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.285\nI brought up parted from the command line,\nbut I didn't actually do anything in it,\n\n554\n00:25:57.285 --> 00:25:59.312\nso [LAUGH] let me bring\nthat back up real quick.\n\n555\n00:25:59.312 --> 00:26:00.530\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n556\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.200\n&gt;&gt; Remember some of the commands that I\nmentioned that were important in the other\n\n557\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.840\nutilities, in parted, for the most part\nthe ones that I always remember are print,\n\n558\n00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.090\nfor printing out my partition table,\nright, so I'm connected to a disk, and\n\n559\n00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.330\nI can see the partitions that are on it.\n\n560\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.360\nSo print, so it would be p normally.\n\n561\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.342\nHere, it's print.\n\n562\n00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:20.930\nAnd then if you want to create\na partition, it's actually mk part.\n\n563\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:21.919\nWhich is make\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n564\n00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Partition.\n\n565\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.790\nRight.\nAnd so, MK Part is what I would run, and\n\n566\n00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:31.790\nI picked my MBR Disk right, which,\nagain, parted is fine with MBR or GPT.\n\n567\n00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.530\nSo it's asked me if I want it\nto be primary or extended.\n\n568\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.350\nI'll tell it I want to be primary.\n\n569\n00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.160\nAnd then what file system I want,\nbecause it's not only gonna\n\n570\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.800\njust create the partition,\nit's gonna format it for me.\n\n571\n00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.150\nWhich is kinda nice, the other utilities\ndon't do that and so I can come in and\n\n572\n00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.650\nspecify how I wanna go with that and\nso on.\n\n573\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:54.580\nSo by doing this, I'm able to work with it\njust right here in a very simple manner.\n\n574\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.310\nShoot, that disk is full, isn't it?\n\n575\n00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.418\nYeah, it's not gonna like that.\n\n576\n00:26:57.418 --> 00:26:58.130\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n577\n00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.500\n&gt;&gt; I picked my actual boot disk there,\n\n578\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.970\nso it wasn't too happy about it.\n\n579\n00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.900\nBut by using utilities like this,\nit does make it much easier to format.\n\n580\n00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.280\nF disk and G disk are always there.\n\n581\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.420\nYou always know they're gonna be there for\nyou right?\n\n582\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.825\nI shouldn't say always, but 99% of\nthe time they're gonna be there for you.\n\n583\n00:27:13.825 --> 00:27:16.060\nParted is not always going to be there.\n\n584\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.320\nYou might need to install it.\n\n585\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.600\nAnd you can just get it from your regular\npackage manager, whichever one you use.\n\n586\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.440\nSo I might do a DNF install parted.\n\n587\n00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:26.660\nLike that.\n\n588\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.622\nIt'll reach out and install our\nyum install parted, or app get,\n\n589\n00:27:30.622 --> 00:27:32.050\ninstall parted.\n\n590\n00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.550\nAnd then same thing with G parted.\n\n591\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.480\nG parted does require\na graphical interface, though.\n\n592\n00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.670\nSo you've got to have X windows and\n\n593\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.770\nall the other good stuff on there for\nit to run.\n\n594\n00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.420\nIf you don't have that,\nstick with parted, F disk, or G disk.\n\n595\n00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Partitioning disks,\nbecoming a Linux system administrator.\n\n596\n00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.491\nLast words.\nYou have two more seconds.\n\n597\n00:27:48.491 --> 00:27:49.466\n&gt;&gt; No, that's it for me.\n\n598\n00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:51.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think if I go on about this,\n\n599\n00:27:51.226 --> 00:27:52.260\nwe're gonna get crazy.\n\n600\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.152\nI do want to talk about LVM.\n\n601\n00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:55.770\nWe're gonna look at the logical\nvolume manager in another episode, so\n\n602\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.030\nstay tuned for that one.\n\n603\n00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.120\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n604\n00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.300\nWell, thanks a lot Don,\nyou did a great job there.\n\n605\n00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.170\nThere´s a lot of content into becoming\na Linux system administrator.\n\n606\n00:28:04.170 -->

00:00:08.099\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.462\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:12.380\n&gt;&gt; Hello again.\n\n6\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.610\nThank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.660\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920\nAs we continue on with becoming\na Linux system administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.240\nAnd right now, we're gonna be looking\ninto formatting and mounting disks.\n\n10\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.748\nAnd the person who's gonna show us\nhow to do that, is Don Pezet, Don?\n\n11\n00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:32.131\n&gt;&gt; Nice to see you, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep, ready to dive right back into\nthe Linux system administrator world.\n\n13\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.630\nIf you're watching our episodes in order,\n\n14\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.540\nour last episode was covering\nhow to partition a disk.\n\n15\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.204\nAnd at the episode, we had created\na bunch of partitions, it was great.\n\n16\n00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:48.630\nBut partitions are pretty useless\nunless we put a file system on them.\n\n17\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.230\nAnd so, here in this episode, we're gonna\nbe talking about how to do that, how to\n\n18\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.840\nput a file system onto a partition, to be\nable to gain access to it and actually\n\n19\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.650\nput your data there and hopefully,\nget your data back when you need it.\n\n20\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.400\nIt's really all kind of\npart of that process.\n\n21\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.960\nSo, that episode really\nisn't a standalone.\n\n22\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.110\nIt should be followed up by this one\nbecause it's really what's necessary to\n\n23\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.390\nmake the disks actually available.\n\n24\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.990\nSo that's what were gonna see,\nright here in this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.770\n&gt;&gt; So when we do that,\nwhen we format a disk and\n\n26\n00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.845\nwe have to choose a file system\nwhat choices do we have?\n\n27\n00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:16.555\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's the big thing\nwe gotta figure out, right?\n\n28\n00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:20.915\nBecause it's not just a matter of\nclick a button and now it's formatted,\n\n29\n00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:25.685\nI've gotta pick a file system to apply and\nthere are a number of choices out there.\n\n30\n00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.755\nIn fact, there's tons, definitely tens,\n\n31\n00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.755\nmaybe even hundreds of different\nfile systems that are out there.\n\n32\n00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:33.945\nBut, in reality, in the Linux world,\n\n33\n00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:38.180\nyou're gonna run across, three file\nsystems, so not that many, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.660\nThe main ones that you're going to\nencounter are Ext, BTRFS, and XFS.\n\n35\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.630\nThose are kind of the three\nbig ones right now.\n\n36\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.100\nI know some of you might be shouting\nat the screen right now saying, no,\n\n37\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.200\nI use ReiserFS, or GlusterFS.\n\n38\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.930\nAll these other ones,\nthose are great file systems.\n\n39\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.090\nZFS is amazing.\n\n40\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.470\nBut, they're not as prominent,\nthey're not as widely accepted, and\n\n41\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.010\nthere's usually different reasons for\nthat.\n\n42\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.500\nZFS has some licensing requirements\nthat a lot of distros don't support.\n\n43\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.100\nSo ZFS isn't built in.\n\n44\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.740\nClusterFS is designed for clustering, it's\nnot really designed for workstations and\n\n45\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.030\nit doesn't do a great job there.\n\n46\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.870\nReiserFS has kinda been\nreplaced by other things.\n\n47\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.530\nSo, there are times where you\nmight see other file systems.\n\n48\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380\nBut if you're formatting a new disk,\n\n49\n00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.260\nyou really usually constrain\nyourself to these three, right?\n\n50\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.560\nThe first one I want to talk about is ext,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.760\nExt actually has more than one version,\nand so you might see ext version two,\n\n52\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.650\next version three, or even ext version\nfour as you go in and format a system.\n\n53\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.210\nNow, you could go with the simple logic.\n\n54\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.650\nI'm gonna use ext,\nI'll just use the newest version.\n\n55\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.780\nVersion four and you're done.\n\n56\n00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.530\nAnd by and large,\nthat's what you want to do.\n\n57\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.538\nUnless you're trying to get backwards\ncompatibility with some other system.\n\n58\n00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:53.330\nBut Ext2 3, and\n4 are actually the same file system.\n\n59\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.590\nThey've just added new features.\n\n60\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.370\nThey added some bells and\nwhistles onto it and\n\n61\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.040\nthe Ext4 has the most bells and whistles.\n\n62\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.415\nExt, I guess I should\nmention what it stands for.\n\n63\n00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:05.255\nIt actually just stands for\nthe extended file system, and\n\n64\n00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:08.745\nwhat it does is it provides a way of\nputting files on the hard drive and\n\n65\n00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:10.335\nmaking it where you can retrieve them.\n\n66\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:11.735\nThat's not too fancy.\n\n67\n00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:12.325\n&gt;&gt; Not fancy.\n\n68\n00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:16.175\n&gt;&gt; But the bells and whistles are things\nlike the ability to resize the partition,\n\n69\n00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:18.125\nyou can grow it or\nshrink it if you need to.\n\n70\n00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:21.865\nThe ability to do journaling.Journaling\nwas added in Ext3 and\n\n71\n00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.150\nupgraded in the Ext4.\n\n72\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.230\nJournaling says,\nwhen you write to the disk,\n\n73\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.070\ndon't overwrite the original file\nuntil you have all of the data.\n\n74\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.940\nAnd the reason it does that is if there's\na power outage in the middle of a write\n\n75\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.130\nyou don't wanna corrupt your file, and\n\n76\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.540\nwith journaling that doesn't happen,\nyou're protected.\n\n77\n00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.260\nSo you get extra disk corruption\nprotection with Ext4.\n\n78\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.720\nSo it's a great filesystem for doing that.\n\n79\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.670\nIt's very robust.\n\n80\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.880\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n81\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.280\nAnd literally, every Linux and\nUNIX distro that's out there supports Ext.\n\n82\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.220\nSo it's really your safest bet.\n\n83\n00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.690\nIt's not the flashiest grandest\nfile system out there.\n\n84\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.180\nBut it is the one that's\nsupported by everything.\n\n85\n00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.620\nIt's very stable, very robust, and\nit's a trustworthy file system.\n\n86\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.960\nSo Ext, especially Ext4 is\nnormally what we're gonna pick.\n\n87\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.165\nBut there are others, right?\n\n88\n00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:14.260\nXFS, Red Hat is the largest\ncommercial provider of Linux.\n\n89\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.440\nThey actually just switched\nto XFS as their default in\n\n90\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.700\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\n91\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.430\nSo if you do a new Red Hat 7 install,\nit will default to XFS.\n\n92\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.790\nXFS is a rewrite of Ext.\n\n93\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.780\nSo, it's an improved version of it.\n\n94\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.350\nAnd basically,\nthe main focus they've had was journaling.\n\n95\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.270\nThat in Ext,\nit didn't have journaling originally.\n\n96\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.270\nThey added it, after the fact.\n\n97\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.980\nThey just kind of bolt it on,\nand so it's not perfect.\n\n98\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.140\nIn XFS, journaling was built\ninto it from the very beginning.\n\n99\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.930\nThe other thing XFS adds is\nthe ability to handle larger volumes.\n\n100\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.460\nAnd when I say larger,\nwe're really talking about like, Petabyes.\n\n101\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.460\nReally huge size, not gigabytes or\nterabytes, even exabytes.\n\n102\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.350\nWe're talking really,\nreally huge amounts of storage.\n\n103\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.730\nSo most of us don't have\nto deal with that, so\n\n104\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.790\nwe don't benefit from XFS that way.\n\n105\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.483\nBut on the journaling side, we do.\n\n106\n00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:02.960\nNow, XFS is really nice.\n\n107\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.860\nAnd I run it on a few of my systems.\n\n108\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.790\nBut it's not the most compatible thing.\n\n109\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.970\nThere's many Linux distros\nthat don't support XFS.\n\n110\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.990\nSo when you choose it,\n\n111\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.970\nyou need to make sure that your\ndistro has full support for it.\n\n112\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.300\nMany of them do, but not all of them.\n\n113\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.420\nNow, BTRFS or the B tree file system,\n\n114\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.480\nthat is the one you'll read\nabout on the internet a lot.\n\n115\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.620\nEverybody's talking about BTRFS.\n\n116\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.440\nAnd if you go based on internet forums,\n\n117\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.590\nyou'll feel like BTRFS is the only\nfile system that should exist.\n\n118\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.420\nI'll tell you it's a great file system.\n\n119\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.800\nIt's got a lot of good features to it but\nit's very new.\n\n120\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.540\nAnd file systems need a little time\nto shake themselves out to check for\n\n121\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.880\nbugs because you don't want your\nfile system becoming corrupted.\n\n122\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.850\nYour system won't boot.\n\n123\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.260\nYou'll lose data.\nThat's really bad.\n\n124\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.690\nSo a file system is something\nthat needs to be trustworthy and\n\n125\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.830\nstable not bleeding edge technology.\n\n126\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.600\nBtrfs is right on that edge of switching\nbetween bleeding edge and stable.\n\n127\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.060\nSo two years from now, we'll probably\nall run Btrfs as our default, right,\n\n128\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.920\nthat will probably be what happens.\n\n129\n00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.790\nBut for right now,\n\n130\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.330\nyou will probably still pick for\nExt4 or XFS when you format a disk.\n\n131\n00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.500\nBtrfs, boy if you want\nto talk about features,\n\n132\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.150\nit has a ton of features built into it.\n\n133\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.610\nWe're going to talk about the logical\nvolume manager, LVM, in another episode.\n\n134\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.700\nBtrfs has an LVM built into it.\n\n135\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.400\nSo they can actually create ray to rays,\nand stripes, it can back up disks,\n\n136\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.830\nit can do all sorts of magic.\n\n137\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.930\nIt's a really,\nreally powerful file system.\n\n138\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.220\nIt's just still taking time to evolve and\nbe fully supported.\n\n139\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.240\nUbuntu, Canonical was actually making\na big push to get Ubuntu to default to\n\n140\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.300\nBtrfs that's coming up,\nbut it hasn't done it yet.\n\n141\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.770\nSo, none of the major\ndistributions default into it.\n\n142\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.900\nBut it is there, you got support, and\nit is kind of the way that we're moving.\n\n143\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.400\nSo, when I go to format a disk,\n\n144\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.560\nif I were to find this right now,\nI'm usually gonna format Ext4.\n\n145\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.840\nIf it's a removable disk,\nI'm gonna go Ext4.\n\n146\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.230\nIf it's my own internal drive,\n\n147\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.130\nI'll typically do XFS,\nbecause only I need to access it.\n\n148\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.470\nBut a removable drive I might be moving\naround a bit and there I'll go Ext4.\n\n149\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.400\nFor example, if you have a drive and you\nwant Windows to access it, there's several\n\n150\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.350\ncompanies like Paragon Software\nthat make a Ext driver for Windows.\n\n151\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.920\nSo on a Windows machine,\nyou can access an Ext disk.\n\n152\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.260\nBut there's not many that do XFS or\nBtrfs for Windows,\n\n153\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.640\nand the ones that are are super beta.\n\n154\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.400\nMost of them are just read-only,\nand you can't write to them.\n\n155\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.890\nSo, there's a lot of limitations there.\n\n156\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.110\nThe Ext4 is much more robust.\n\n157\n00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.070\nSo that's kind of the way\nthat I make the decision.\n\n158\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.690\nBut don't feel shoe-horned into my model,\nit's just what works for me.\n\n159\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.700\nThe Ext4 for removable disks and\nXFS for fixed disks.\n\n160\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.110\nBut again,\nyou can kinda go however you want on that.\n\n161\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.460\n&gt;&gt; So now that we have an idea\nof the different choices,\n\n162\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.880\nhow do we actually go about installing and\nworking with one of these file systems?\n\n163\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's actually a little confusing,\nand they've done a lot to make it easier\n\n164\n00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.150\non us, but each file system has its\nown tool for formatting a disk.\n\n165\n00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.810\nWhen you format a disk, you´re just\nlaying the file system on top of it.\n\n166\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.935\nAnd there´s different tools that do it.\n\n167\n00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:02.607\nIf you ever poke around in your hard\ndrive, you're bored, you can go into,\n\n168\n00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.879\nhere, I´ll go into /user/sbin.\n\n169\n00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:08.799\nAnd, if you look at all the files\nthat are in there, well,\n\n170\n00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:11.610\nhere's all these XFS files, right.\n\n171\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.970\nThese are all utilities for\nworking with XFS.\n\n172\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.010\nAnd so if I'm using it,\nI've got this utility, great.\n\n173\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.070\nBut if I'm not using it,\nthen I don't use those.\n\n174\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:25.000\nBut, if you just go and look for\neverything starting with MK, right.\n\n175\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.819\nM, whoops, if I get to, here we go, MK,\n\n176\n00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:31.951\nthe MK commands are used from\nmaking file systems, or mkfs.\n\n177\n00:08:31.951 --> 00:08:37.390\nAnd as you look in here,\nyou'll see a lot of utilities like mke2fs.\n\n178\n00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.560\nThat's gonna make an ext2 file system.\n\n179\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.960\nBut say I've got mkfs.ext2, ext3,\next4, and all these other ones, right?\n\n180\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.580\nMost of these aren't actual commands.\n\n181\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.480\nMost of these are just aliases.\n\n182\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.082\nAll right, aliases so that I don't have\nto remember the actual command, right.\n\n183\n00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:58.790\nI'm gonna remember how to make a btrfs\nfile system or a XFS file system.\n\n184\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.885\nBut if I do mkfs.,\nfollowed by the file system name,\n\n185\n00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:07.528\nthat command can create XFS or btrfs.\n\n186\n00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:09.400\nI see them all right there, right.\n\n187\n00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:16.297\nSo these are wrappers and these wrappers,\nW-R-A-P-P-E-R-S, not Ice-T.\n\n188\n00:09:16.297 --> 00:09:17.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.380\n&gt;&gt; These wrappers,\n\n190\n00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.410\nthey're just kind of encapsulating\nanother command, right.\n\n191\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.660\nIt's basically gonna\nhelp me to remember that.\n\n192\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.001\nSo these are the utilities\nthat we wanna use.\n\n193\n00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:31.651\nSo if I wanna format something XFS,\nI'll use mkfs.xfs, but\n\n194\n00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:36.858\nwhat that's actually doing is\ncalling another utility somewhere.\n\n195\n00:09:36.858 --> 00:09:39.790\nSo see like these DOS ones or\nWindows ones had their light blue,\n\n196\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.350\nthose are actually links that\nare linked to something else,\n\n197\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.530\nmore than likely linked to,\nI was about to say mk.dosfs.\n\n198\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.380\nBut that one's actually light blue also.\n\n199\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.658\nSo if we wanna see where these\nthings are linked, let's do,\n\n200\n00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:53.370\nlet's look at this a little differently,\nhere.\n\n201\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.730\nWe can see with some of these link,\nhere we go.\n\n202\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.540\nSo mkfs.msdos is actually linked to\nmkfs.files, so that doesn't help us.\n\n203\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.870\nBut, if we looked into mkfs.fat,\nit intern as a wrapper for\n\n204\n00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.235\nanother utility that's available.\n\n205\n00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:09.665\nSo each of these are used for\nmaking those different file systems.\n\n206\n00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:11.502\nAnd if I wanna format a disk, right,\n\n207\n00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:14.350\nI'm gonna run a bunch of\nadministrative commands here so\n\n208\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.628\nthat to save me from to sudo everything\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n209\n00:10:16.628 --> 00:10:20.095\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna do a sudo -s there, so\nI'm switching over the root context.\n\n210\n00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:23.555\nJust be aware, you do need to\nbe a root user to format disks.\n\n211\n00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:25.675\nNot the root user,\nyou need to have elevated privileges.\n\n212\n00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:28.169\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You normally need to sudo all this.\n\n213\n00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:33.640\nBut I'm gonna do an fdisk -l /dev/sdb.\n\n214\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.103\nAnd, so I've got four partitions\nright there on my sdb disk, right?\n\n215\n00:10:38.103 --> 00:10:40.990\nThey're all 500 megs in size,\npretty small, but\n\n216\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.860\nI wanna drop file systems on them.\n\n217\n00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:50.341\nAnd to do that, all I have to do is use\nsome of the various utilities like mkfs.\n\n218\n00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:55.048\nAnd here's the neat part is,\nI can say mkfs.ext2,\n\n219\n00:10:55.048 --> 00:11:00.172\nright, now I'm saying I wanna\nmake an ext2 file system,\n\n220\n00:11:00.172 --> 00:11:03.535\nand I can point that to /dev/sdb1.\n\n221\n00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:08.490\nOkay, and that's gonna run and it's gonna\ndrop a file system right there on sdb1.\n\n222\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.770\nOkay, and there it goes,\nit writes it and it's done.\n\n223\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.550\nI did small partitions,\nso this would be faster.\n\n224\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.870\nThe larger partition,\nthe longer that takes, right.\n\n225\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.980\nSo do be aware, it can take a while,\nbut that one is done.\n\n226\n00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.920\nBut when I ran mkfs.ext2,\n\n227\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.370\nwhat it actually did in the background\nwas something a little different.\n\n228\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:33.080\nIt actually ran mkfs, and\nthen it provided it with -t ext2, right?\n\n229\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.530\nBecause, that's providing the file\nsystem type, the mkfs command, right?\n\n230\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.314\nSo, the command that I run,\nis just a wrapper that is kind of\n\n231\n00:11:42.314 --> 00:11:47.031\nproviding an alias to applying\nthat file system, right?\n\n232\n00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:49.040\nAnd those usually do\nmake life a lot easier.\n\n233\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.650\nSo I normally do something\nlike mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2 and\n\n234\n00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.370\nthat will drop an ext4\nfile system on there.\n\n235\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.900\nI can continue to do the same exact thing.\n\n236\n00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.019\nIf I wanted to do XFS, we had mkfs.xfs and\n\n237\n00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:07.389\nI can drop that on sdb3 and\nso there it goes.\n\n238\n00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:09.980\nNow notice how the syntax\nis a lot different?\n\n239\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.690\nAnd that's because\nthe command is different.\n\n240\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.630\nIt's running a different utility\nto apply that file system.\n\n241\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.110\nAnd, then it's given me the information\nback on it, and same thing for\n\n242\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.180\nthings like btrfs, we just keep going.\n\n243\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.054\nSo it's not hard to\nremember these commands,\n\n244\n00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:23.841\nthanks to those wrappers\nthat are in place.\n\n245\n00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:27.691\nSo I just need to remember, mkfs for\nmake file system, dot, whatever\n\n246\n00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:32.020\nthe file system is, and then pointed\nit at the disk that I want to format.\n\n247\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.270\nAnd then it applies it, and\nnow I've got those file systems in place,\n\n248\n00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:40.050\nso if I do an fdisk -l,\nnow I see the partitions.\n\n249\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:45.190\nAnd they're formatted, whoops,\nlet me limit that to sdb.\n\n250\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.340\nI see the partitions, but they've actually\ngot a file system on them now as well.\n\n251\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.666\nAnd that means, I'll actually\nbe able to put files on there,\n\n252\n00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:54.020\nwhich is kind of an important part.\n\n253\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.582\n&gt;&gt; So is this the only command,\nor series of commands,\n\n254\n00:12:56.582 --> 00:12:59.710\nthat we need to know when we're\nworking with file systems?\n\n255\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.990\n&gt;&gt; That these are the main ones, right.\n\n256\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.490\nSo mkfs, we format it and then,\nyou don't normally format it again, right,\n\n257\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.950\nyou just format it and you walk away.\n\n258\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.700\nThere are other utilities\nyou might bump into like,\n\n259\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.770\nhere, let me see if I can find one.\n\n260\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.500\nThere, resize2fs, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.190\nThat is a utility that will let\nyou grow or shrink ext partitions.\n\n262\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.380\nI know it says, 2fs, but\nit does it for 3 and 4, as well.\n\n263\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.360\nSo I can shrink and grow ext2, 3, and\n4 partitions by using that command.\n\n264\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.530\nThat's one utility that is available\nthat's not part of mkfs, right,\n\n265\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.240\ncuz I'm not making a file system.\n\n266\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.250\nI'm changing one that already exists.\n\n267\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.956\nAnother type of file system that I didn't\nreally talk about, were swap partitions.\n\n268\n00:13:39.956 --> 00:13:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n269\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.490\n&gt;&gt; If you make a swap partition,\nit doesn't actually get used by default.\n\n270\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.100\nYou have to put a swap file system\non it and turn on for swapping.\n\n271\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.700\nSo when I create that partition,\n\n272\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.160\nactually here let me do,\n\n273\n00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:05.297\nLet me do fdisk /dev/sdd.\n\n274\n00:14:05.297 --> 00:14:07.318\nI'm trying to think of which\none I would have formatted.\n\n275\n00:14:07.318 --> 00:14:12.020\nGPT versus GYD, we'll do that, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.810\nSo I'm taking /dev/sdd, right, and\nI'm gonna create a partition on here.\n\n277\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:24.470\nAnd I will make it, not too big,\nmaybe just 2 gigabytes in size, right?\n\n278\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.048\nAnd then I'm gonna flag\nthat as a swap partition,\n\n279\n00:14:29.048 --> 00:14:32.645\nwhich is 82, let's find it in here.\n\n280\n00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:36.904\nThis is organized kind of weird, so\nI got to try and find, there it is 8200,\n\n281\n00:14:36.904 --> 00:14:37.940\n8-2-0-0.\n\n282\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.260\nAlright, so, oops, let's try that again.\n\n283\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.348\nThere, all right, so\nI'm creating a swap partition.\n\n284\n00:14:44.348 --> 00:14:47.615\nRight, now a swap partition\ndoesn't get an ext file system,\n\n285\n00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:49.880\ncuz it's actually swapping RAM,\nmemory, in there,\n\n286\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.930\nwhich is not following the same\nrules as a file system.\n\n287\n00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.860\nSo when I have that in place,\nthat partition right there,\n\n288\n00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.340\nwhat's my /dev/sdd1.\n\n289\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.440\nIf I want to actually use that,\nI've got to enable it.\n\n290\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.260\nSo I need to come in here and\nuse the swapon command.\n\n291\n00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.240\nAnd swapon, I can just go in and\nsay, /dev/sdd1.\n\n292\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.370\nAnd now it's gonna reach out, and\nit's going to apply that to it, and\n\n293\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.460\nI got an error.\n\n294\n00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.170\nDid I get the partition number wrong or\nsomething?\n\n295\n00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:29.090\nSo, I may have set that one up as mbr and\nthen screwed it up.\n\n296\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.010\nOr might be the wrong size, but swapon\nis the utility that we'll use for that.\n\n297\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.890\nAnd if I just kind of run it,\nthey'll show me what I've got.\n\n298\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.453\nAnd it complains because I've\nalready got a swap partition,\n\n299\n00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:40.292\nwhich it's not letting\nme add a second one.\n\n300\n00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:43.770\nBut swapon and you'll provide that\ndestination, and it prepares it, and\n\n301\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.390\ngets it ready to be used as a swap disks.\n\n302\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.301\nThat's another one that's available.\n\n303\n00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:51.450\nAnd so you'll find other file\nsystem utilities like that.\n\n304\n00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.454\nBut usually, mkfs,\nwe make the file system,\n\n305\n00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.928\nwe put it there, fsck is another one.\n\n306\n00:15:56.928 --> 00:16:00.553\nThe file system check utility, if we think\nthere's errors, we can use fsck to check\n\n307\n00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:03.730\nit, we'll see an example of that\na little bit later in this episode.\n\n308\n00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.184\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well now that we've\nGot that all taken care of.\n\n309\n00:16:07.184 --> 00:16:11.570\nNow that we've got it formatted,\nwe can now use it, right?\n\n310\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.038\n&gt;&gt; Sort of, yes.\n\n311\n00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of?\n\n312\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.740\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's all kind of crazy.\n\n313\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.940\nBut if I take a look at my SDB disc.\n\n314\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.240\nI've got four partitions and\n\n315\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.000\nI formatted each of them with\na different file system, right?\n\n316\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.060\nI did ext2, ext4, xfs, and btrfs.\n\n317\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.960\nRight, they're all formatted,\nthey've gone in the file system so\n\n318\n00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.540\nin theory, I can use them.\n\n319\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.150\nBut how do the users get to them?\n\n320\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.350\nThere's not really a way for\nthe user to get there yet, right?\n\n321\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.290\nIf they go into their files here and\nthey start browsing.\n\n322\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.030\nMaybe they go to other locations.\n\n323\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.750\nThey see the computer and\nwell there they are.\n\n324\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.290\nThey're showing up.\n\n325\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.580\nBut look how they're showing up.\n\n326\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.580\nThey're showing up as slash\ndev slash sdb1 or sdb2.\n\n327\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.190\nThat's not really intuitive to the user.\n\n328\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.650\nThey don't know what\nthese things are right?\n\n329\n00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.270\nThis, what I'm seeing right here,\nis what's called automatic mounting.\n\n330\n00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.020\nA lot of operating systems, as soon as you\nformat a disk or you plug in a USB disk or\n\n331\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.180\nsomething like that,\nthey will automatically mount it and\n\n332\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:07.680\nbring it online.\n\n333\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.280\nOkay, so that's what's happened here.\n\n334\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.890\nThese are mounted.\n\n335\n00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.070\nI can use them, right.\n\n336\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.810\nSo the short answer to\nZack's question is yes.\n\n337\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.880\nBut the longer answer is, yes but\n\n338\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.680\nit's not quite ideal the way\nthat it's set up right now.\n\n339\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.590\nA lot of times you won't like\nthe way that it mounts this stuff,\n\n340\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.060\nor I know I don't,\nbecause it mounts it in a weird directory.\n\n341\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.820\nFirst off, for the users they have no\nidea of knowing which of these is which.\n\n342\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.920\nThey all look the same.\n\n343\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.730\nAnd that's because they're all just\nkind of listed here by their size.\n\n344\n00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.550\nAnd they're all identical in size,\nso how do I know which one is which?\n\n345\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.770\nShort answer is I don't.\n\n346\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.820\nI don't and maybe I know slash dev\nslash sdb and the partition number.\n\n347\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.270\nBut that's a crummy way to remember\nwhich drive I save something to.\n\n348\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.510\nYeah I save that to partition\nnumber three right?\n\n349\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.430\nIt's nicer to have a name.\n\n350\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:52.630\nA name that we can recognize what exactly\nthat is that we're looking at but,\n\n351\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.990\nIf they were to browse in and\nstart to use it.\n\n352\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.680\nWell, look what just happened.\n\n353\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.210\nHmm, I need to be an administrator\nto mess with this disk.\n\n354\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.140\nWhy is that?\n\n355\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.580\nWell because it was\nformatted by the root user.\n\n356\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.700\nThe permissions are wrong on this disk.\n\n357\n00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.470\nSo there's two things that we really\nneed to do before we start using these\n\n358\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.670\ndisks in earnest.\n\n359\n00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.120\nAnd that is one, we need to mount\nthem somewhere meaningful so\n\n360\n00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.290\nthey have a name so\nwe can recognize what they are.\n\n361\n00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.920\nAnd two,\nwe need to change their permissions so\n\n362\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.190\nthat users are able to actually\nmake use of those partitions.\n\n363\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.260\nOtherwise, they're not going to\nhave access by default because\n\n364\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.597\nit's all going to be run are owned\nby the root user by default, right.\n\n365\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.620\nSo, those are things that get taken care\nof for us when we use graphgu utilities.\n\n366\n00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.420\nWhen you use things like\nthe disc's utility in nome,\n\n367\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.140\nit takes care of this stuff for us.\n\n368\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.750\nBut if we need to do it by hand\n\n369\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.400\nnow we get a little more\ninvolved with an out process.\n\n370\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.510\nSo I want to show you guys how we can\nmount these things and get them online.\n\n371\n00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.590\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Now the first thing you can do,\n\n372\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.660\nreally handy command,\nis just running mount.\n\n373\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.380\nIf you run the mount command by itself,\n\n374\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.100\nit'll show you everything\nthat's mounted on your system.\n\n375\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.730\nAnd unfortunately, on most distros,\n\n376\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.160\nthere's a lot of stuff\nthat gets mounted here.\n\n377\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.840\nSo you'll see a lot of output.\n\n378\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.340\nSo I'm going to pipe that\ninto the grep command and\n\n379\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.340\nI'm just going to look for\n/dev/sdb like that, okay.\n\n380\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.750\nAnd what I should find,\n\n381\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.440\nif I do it right, is those four\npartitions should be mounted.\n\n382\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.250\nAnd they actually didn't turn up here,\nwhich is interesting.\n\n383\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.180\nLet me just scroll up and\nsee if I can spot them.\n\n384\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.490\nWow, it did not show up as mounted.\n\n385\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.120\nSo we need to get them mounted\nto be able to use them.\n\n386\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.150\nYou can see like here slash dev,\nslash SDA 1 is showing up.\n\n387\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.365\nThat's where my boot is,\na root will be mounted the same.\n\n388\n00:19:33.365 --> 00:19:36.220\nI've get the logical volume manager also\nwhich is kind of messing up this right\n\n389\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.960\nwhere we see all this complexity here,\na lot of that's the LVM doing it, right?\n\n390\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.240\nBut if I want to mount those\nindividual discs, I can.\n\n391\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.370\nNow, I might run into an issue\nhere because the auto-mounter\n\n392\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.230\nis mounting these through some\nkind of non-standard way Right?\n\n393\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.890\nSo, they're showing here is discs,\nbut they're not actually mounted,\n\n394\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.250\nwhich is likely why.\n\n395\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.675\nActually, if I would read\nthe message that's on my screen.\n\n396\n00:19:56.675 --> 00:19:58.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's actually telling me here,\n\n397\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.360\nauthentication is required\nto mount the disk right.\n\n398\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.370\nIt's a virtual disk so\nit's not actually mounted,\n\n399\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.580\nthat's why I'm not seeing it in my list.\n\n400\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.404\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Get your wallet out and\nshow them your Id.\n\n401\n00:20:06.404 --> 00:20:09.780\n&gt;&gt; Basically yeah, they want me to\nauthenticate there but I'm not gonna do it\n\n402\n00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.490\nfrom here because I want to give these\nthings something a little more meaningful.\n\n403\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.680\nSo I'm gonna mount that and when we\nmount a disk what we do is we attach it\n\n404\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.800\nto a folder on the hard drive somewhere.\n\n405\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.600\nYou create a folder, basically a logical\npoint, it'll point to that disk, and\n\n406\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.770\na lot of the auto-mounters\nwill put them in weird places,\n\n407\n00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.750\nlike in the red hat world, there's\na folder called run, and if you go into\n\n408\n00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.720\nslash run or, sorry, it's slash media,\nnot slash run, let me get that right.\n\n409\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.620\nWell, actually,\nam I just completely wrong here?\n\n410\n00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.890\nLet me check this out here.\n\n411\n00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.020\nOr maybe because I don´t\nhave a disk in place.\n\n412\n00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:52.330\nBut a lot of times it will put it in\n/run/media/yourusername/ the name of\n\n413\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.850\nthat disk.\n\n414\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.890\nSo it kind of gets tucked\naway in this weird folder and\n\n415\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.350\nthat´s where we usually want\ntemporary type mounts to be,\n\n416\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.950\nones that are just going to be here for\na little while, that are going to go away.\n\n417\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.810\nSo the slash run folder might have it.\n\n418\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.040\nThere is slash media as well and\nmight end up in there.\n\n419\n00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.590\nIt's another place it can turn up.\n\n420\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.500\nSome systems actually mount\nthese things temporarily to /var\n\n421\n00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.770\nwhich is a really bad idea,\nbut some of them do it.\n\n422\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.080\nIn the olden days.\n\n423\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.890\n&gt;&gt; Olden days.\n\n424\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.742\n&gt;&gt; We put everything in /mount, right?\n\n425\n00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.890\n/mnt, which is where we\nwould mount things to.\n\n426\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.700\nBut it's not so pretty,\nand so now, /media.\n\n427\n00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.570\nLet's go there.\n\n428\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.690\nSo there are different places\nthat these disks can end up.\n\n429\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.790\nIf you're going to mount the disk and make\nit available for use, you need to put it\n\n430\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.790\nsomewhere that the people who need\naccess to it will have access to it.\n\n431\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.246\nIf I'm the only one who's gonna access it,\n\n432\n00:21:36.246 --> 00:21:38.970\nI might as well mount\nit my home directory.\n\n433\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.310\nI can do that, and\nnow I'll only have access to it.\n\n434\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.480\nBut if I want everybody to get it,\nI need to put it somewhere meaningful.\n\n435\n00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.080\nAnd I'm gonna use /mount cuz that's\nwhere I've always put it in the past.\n\n436\n00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.000\nSo I'm gonna use /mount.\n\n437\n00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.130\nAnd I need to make folders\nto mount these things to.\n\n438\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.660\nAnd I've got four partitions.\n\n439\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.720\nMaybe each partition has\na different purpose, right.\n\n440\n00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.980\nOne is going to store documents for sales.\n\n441\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.850\nSo I'll make directory sales.\n\n442\n00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.950\nAnother one might be for marketing.\n\n443\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.950\nSo I'm going to create the folder for\nmarketing.\n\n444\n00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.940\nThere might be operations and\nhuman resources.\n\n445\n00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.960\nSo those are going to be my\nfour partitions, all right.\n\n446\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.300\nSo I'll create a folder for each one.\n\n447\n00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.340\nNow what I need to do is, well,\nthese are just regular old folders.\n\n448\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.720\nNothing too special there.\n\n449\n00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.340\nSo I need to attach those\ndrives to these folders.\n\n450\n00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.820\nThat's what mounting does.\n\n451\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:33.610\nSo when I mount, I can say mount and\nthen I specify the device.\n\n452\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:40.010\nSo I'll say /dev/sdb1 and then,\nI tell it where I want to mount it to.\n\n453\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.630\nSo I'm going to mount that to /mnt/sales,\nokay?\n\n454\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.230\nAnd by doing that,\nit attaches /dev/sfdb1, that device,\n\n455\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.920\nthat partition to that folder.\n\n456\n00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.290\nAnd folders make a lot more sense.\n\n457\n00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.930\nA user looks at this and\nsays it's the sales folder.\n\n458\n00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.440\nThey don't even know there's a hard\ndrive behind it, they just see a folder,\n\n459\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.780\nright and the folder's named sales and\nthey know what's supposed to go in there.\n\n460\n00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.270\nAnd I can sit here and\nrepeat that process for\n\n461\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:10.780\neach of these partitions mounting each\none to a different folder, right?\n\n462\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.420\nAnd I run through, it's mounting these.\n\n463\n00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.200\nNow, there is one extra operation that's\nhappening in the background here,\n\n464\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.160\nthankfully, which is it's automatically\ndetecting the file system.\n\n465\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.550\nRemember, all four of my\npartitions have file systems and\n\n466\n00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.920\nI've kind of forgotten which\none is which at this point.\n\n467\n00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.830\nI want to say that SDB3 was XFS.\n\n468\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:34.640\nSo, really if I wanted to see what\nthis full command was and maybe\n\n469\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.240\nthe file system detection and it tells\nyou it doesn't recognize the file system.\n\n470\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.400\nI might have to tell\nit what it's gonna be.\n\n471\n00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.040\nAnd so the way we do that\nis by adding a little -t,\n\n472\n00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.390\nso you'd say mount -t and then you\nwould tell it the file system, so for\n\n473\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:54.090\nexample xfs and by telling it that now,\nit knows the file system.\n\n474\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.500\nAnd it can mount it.\n\n475\n00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.304\nBut it usually automatically detects it,\nand that saves us a lot of effort there.\n\n476\n00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:05.710\nAnd makes us kind of work a lot more\nsmoothly, sdb4 for example is btrfs.\n\n477\n00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.806\nAnd I'm just gonna mount it, and\n\n478\n00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:08.890\nI didn't have to tell it that\nit automatically figured it out.\n\n479\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.060\nAnd it mounted it, right there, okay?\n\n480\n00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.660\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n481\n00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.443\n&gt;&gt; Now that that's done, when I run\nthe mount command, I can look and\n\n482\n00:24:16.443 --> 00:24:19.528\nhere's sdb1, sdb2, sdb3 and sdb4.\n\n483\n00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:23.240\nAnd notice the file system\ntypes right here, right?\n\n484\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.910\nI've got sdb1 was mounted to sales,\nand it's the ext2.\n\n485\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.220\nThe next one was ext4, and the next\none is xfs, and the last one is btrfs.\n\n486\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.720\nIt figured all that out for me.\n\n487\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.650\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; It mounted it and brought them online.\n\n488\n00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.330\nNow, it is wonderful in\nthat now they're mounted.\n\n489\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:44.919\nAnd for a user browsing in their\nfile system, they can come in,\n\n490\n00:24:44.919 --> 00:24:49.564\nthey can browse to the file system,\nand go into MNT.\n\n491\n00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:52.622\nWhich is, again, not the prettiest thing,\nso that's where they say\n\n492\n00:24:52.622 --> 00:24:55.950\nlet's put it in /media, or /run,\nyou can put it wherever you want, right?\n\n493\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.250\nWhatever works for you.\n\n494\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.362\nBut once you go in here, now I've got\nan HR folder, a marketing folder,\n\n495\n00:25:00.362 --> 00:25:03.488\nan operations folder and a sales folder\nand I can browse right into them.\n\n496\n00:25:03.488 --> 00:25:06.503\nAnd I can start to put files in there and\nstart to work with it,\n\n497\n00:25:06.503 --> 00:25:08.478\nassuming I have permissions, right?\n\n498\n00:25:08.478 --> 00:25:09.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We've always got to double check those\n\n499\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.760\npermissions cuz if we do like a quick\nls-la on these notice how the root\n\n500\n00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.590\nuser has read, write and execute,\neverybody else has read and execute.\n\n501\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.990\nSo if I were to try and\ndrop a file in here, right,\n\n502\n00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.210\nlet me see do I have anything,\nI don't even have any files.\n\n503\n00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.680\nI can do it from the command line.\n\n504\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.678\nSo if I were to,\n\n505\n00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:36.630\ngo into that folder, right,\ninto like sales, for example, right?\n\n506\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.510\nSo here, I'm in sales, I can look at it.\n\n507\n00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.510\nI'm logged in as dpizzet.\n\n508\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.490\nBut if I try and create a file,\nPermission denied, right?\n\n509\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.140\nSo now we need to go and\nupdate the permissions.\n\n510\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.160\nAnd we've seen permissions\nin other episodes.\n\n511\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.660\nWe could solve this really quickly\nif we just wanted to go, super easy.\n\n512\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.880\nI could do like,\nchmod- R to make this recursive.\n\n513\n00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.321\nI could add read and write to everybody,\n\n514\n00:26:02.321 --> 00:26:05.687\n/mnt/Sales, right?\n\n515\n00:26:05.687 --> 00:26:09.075\nAnd so that's going to churn right along\nthat directory and give everyone read and\n\n516\n00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:09.920\nwrite access to it.\n\n517\n00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.322\nAnd so now as my regular old user I should\nbe able to come in and create that.\n\n518\n00:26:15.322 --> 00:26:17.803\nShoot, I've gotta actually exit out and\ncome back in before it works.\n\n519\n00:26:17.803 --> 00:26:22.430\nBut once that's done then it'll happen and\nI'll be able to read and write to it.\n\n520\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.610\nSo changing the permissions\nare kind of important.\n\n521\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.960\nAnother thing that might actually\nstop me here, is I'm running Fedora.\n\n522\n00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.304\nAnd Fedora has a security subsystem\nunder it called SC Linux,\n\n523\n00:26:32.304 --> 00:26:33.790\nsecurity enhanced Linux.\n\n524\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:38.199\nAnd SC Linux controls where you're allowed\nto access when you work with the system,\n\n525\n00:26:38.199 --> 00:26:41.550\nso when you mount a disk, it may not\nbe set up right for SC Linux and\n\n526\n00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.940\nthat can also stop write.\n\n527\n00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.495\nSo my permission denied here I don't know\nif that actually came from permissions or\n\n528\n00:26:46.495 --> 00:26:48.018\nfrom SC Linux at this point.\n\n529\n00:26:48.018 --> 00:26:51.210\nSo, I could fire up the SC Linux\ntroubleshooter and go in and\n\n530\n00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.380\nsee if I got a block message in here or\nnot and kinda work through it that way.\n\n531\n00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.260\nOn ubuntu to be in mint,\nyou don't have that.\n\n532\n00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.434\nThat's not a problem.\nWe don't have to worry about that, but\n\n533\n00:27:01.434 --> 00:27:03.200\non Red Hat you do and on Fedora you do.\n\n534\n00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.260\nSo, just be aware of those\nextra concerns there.\n\n535\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.320\nBut at this point, it's mounted,\nit's available, and I can actually use it.\n\n536\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.378\n&gt;&gt; So when we mounted this,\nit's permanent, right?\n\n537\n00:27:14.378 --> 00:27:15.111\n&gt;&gt; Good question, right?\n\n538\n00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:15.976\nSo, no.\n\n539\n00:27:15.976 --> 00:27:16.864\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n540\n00:27:16.864 --> 00:27:19.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I were to reboot right now,\n\n541\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.830\nall these go away.\n\n542\n00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, is there something that\nwe can do to make it permanent?\n\n543\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.520\nI'm sure there is.\n\n544\n00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, and\nyou certainly want to.\n\n545\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.104\nI normally mount them temporarily\nlike this, just to test it out,\n\n546\n00:27:29.104 --> 00:27:30.760\njust to make sure it worked, right?\n\n547\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.170\nOnce I know it works, then I go in and\nI make it permanent, okay?\n\n548\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.450\nTo make it permanent,\nwe need to modify a little file.\n\n549\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.990\nThere's a file called\nthe file system table.\n\n550\n00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.271\nIt's inside of /etc.\n\n551\n00:27:43.478 --> 00:27:47.020\n&gt;&gt; If I take a look at /etc/fstab, right?\n\n552\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.470\nFile system table,\ninside of that is a list\n\n553\n00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.060\nof all the partitions that are gonna\nbe mounted when my computer boots up.\n\n554\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.770\nAnd so, when I reboot the computer,\nthis is what's going to be mounted.\n\n555\n00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.680\nAll those ones I just added they're not\nin here, they're not a part of this list.\n\n556\n00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.280\nSo if I want them to be\nthere every time I reboot,\n\n557\n00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.390\nI need to add them to\nthe file system table.\n\n558\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.490\nSo I'm going to edit that, and\nagain I'm logged in as root right now, so\n\n559\n00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.710\nyou do need to be at elevated\nprivileges to do this.\n\n560\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:22.010\nI will edit, /etc/Fstab and\nI've already got some entries in here\n\n561\n00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.480\nfrom my operating system, I don't want to\nmess with those cuz I still need to boot.\n\n562\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.340\nBut I need to add my four new entries,\nright?\n\n563\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.257\nSo I'm gonna come and I'm gonna add that.\n\n564\n00:28:30.257 --> 00:28:34.423\nI'm gonna add /dev/sda1 and\n\n565\n00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:40.137\nI'm gonna mount that one to /mnt/sales.\n\n566\n00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:41.881\nI don't remember how I\nmounted them before, so\n\n567\n00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:43.110\nI'll just make it up as I go here.\n\n568\n00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.100\nBut I'm going to mount sda1 to sales.\n\n569\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.220\nI do need it to tell it the file system,\nright?\n\n570\n00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.540\nWell, that one is ext2.\n\n571\n00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.750\nSo I do need to know that.\n\n572\n00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.320\nThen, options.\n\n573\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.050\nYou could provide all sorts\nof runtime options here.\n\n574\n00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.180\nYou could mount a partition, read-only.\n\n575\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.023\nAnd now no matter what the permissions\nare, nobody will be able to write to that.\n\n576\n00:29:00.023 --> 00:29:03.110\nThat's really handy if you have like\nan archive disk, you can do that.\n\n577\n00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.880\nYou can adjust how the caches work and\nthe buffers.\n\n578\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.110\nYou can set certain permissions,\n\n579\n00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.670\nthere's all sorts of crazy things\nyou can do here as far as options.\n\n580\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.738\nBut if you're just trying\nto get the disk on line,\n\n581\n00:29:13.738 --> 00:29:16.620\ndefaults is what we're normally\ngoing to use, all right?\n\n582\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.570\nThese next two options aren't\nreally used all that much anymore.\n\n583\n00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.438\nThe first one is actually keyed\nto a utility called dump,\n\n584\n00:29:23.438 --> 00:29:26.379\nway back in the olden days there\nwas a utility called dump.\n\n585\n00:29:26.379 --> 00:29:29.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, this is like 1970s.\n\n586\n00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.730\n&gt;&gt; Way back in the olden days.\n\n587\n00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.160\n&gt;&gt; And you would use the dump\nutility to basically back up a disk.\n\n588\n00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.330\nAnd if you had a one here\n\n589\n00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.620\nthat would say when you run dump\nit's allowed to back up this disk.\n\n590\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.360\nAnd if you had zero then when dump was\nrun it wouldn't back up this disk.\n\n591\n00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.306\nNotice how the partition,\nthe swap drive, has a 0.\n\n592\n00:29:48.306 --> 00:29:50.290\nNo point in backing up a swap drive.\n\n593\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.050\nBut your other disks here have a 1.\n\n594\n00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.840\nSo you can set it to 1 if you want.\n\n595\n00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.416\nThe reality is nobody runs dump anymore,\nso this is effectively useless.\n\n596\n00:29:57.416 --> 00:30:00.420\nSo it doesn't really matter if you put\n0 or 1 here if you don't use dump.\n\n597\n00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.987\nBut if you want to air on the side of\nsafety you can stick a 1 on there and\n\n598\n00:30:02.987 --> 00:30:04.820\nnow the dump command will\nbe able to back this up.\n\n599\n00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.960\nThe next one is customizing the order\nin which the file system check is run.\n\n600\n00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.080\nWhen you boot your operating\nsystem it looks for\n\n601\n00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.687\nany corruption in the file system and\ntries to fix any problems, right?\n\n602\n00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.266\nAnd it focuses on the root drive first\nbecause we need that to boot, and\n\n603\n00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:22.430\nthen all of the other drives second.\n\n604\n00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.040\nSo in here you can put\none of three values.\n\n605\n00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.980\nYou can put zero, one, or two.\n\n606\n00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.470\nIf you put zero,\nthat means don't do a file system check.\n\n607\n00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.095\nThat's not good.\n\n608\n00:30:30.095 --> 00:30:33.285\nOne means this is high priority,\nI need to check it right away.\n\n609\n00:30:33.285 --> 00:30:37.550\nTwo means it's low priority,\nyou can check it whenever, right?\n\n610\n00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:42.375\nAccording to standard,\nyou should have one for your root and\n\n611\n00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:43.880\ntwo for everything else, right?\n\n612\n00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.640\nUnless you don't want to check it and\nthen you can just leave it at zero, so\n\n613\n00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.500\nit'll be one, zero.\n\n614\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.250\nBut all across the United, you'll find\ntons of people who put it to one one, and\n\n615\n00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.300\nyou can do that.\n\n616\n00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.760\nOne means the dump utility worked and\n\n617\n00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.790\nthe second one means check\nthis at the same time as root.\n\n618\n00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.010\nAnd what that's gonna do is it's\ngonna slow down your boot up.\n\n619\n00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.340\nSo if you don't care about boot time,\nyou can put one one in here and\n\n620\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.140\nthat'll be fine.\n\n621\n00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.320\nBut one two will make sure that you\ncan continue to boot while it's still\n\n622\n00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.610\nfile system checking this drive.\n\n623\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:13.365\nAnd so I'm gonna do that same process for\neach of the other petitions that I have.\n\n624\n00:31:13.365 --> 00:31:16.620\nAnd I'm using tab to make\nthis kind of line up.\n\n625\n00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.010\nYou don't have to, a single space will do.\n\n626\n00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:23.130\nBut I'm just gonna punch\nin each one of these and\n\n627\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.770\njust get them in here kind of\nfollowing that same model.\n\n628\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.442\nAnd now what's gonna happen is\nanytime I reboot these will\n\n629\n00:31:32.442 --> 00:31:34.501\nautomatically be mounted.\n\n630\n00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:37.930\nThey'll be mounted to those folders and\nthey'll be ready to rock.\n\n631\n00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:42.560\nSo that's how we make them permanent, and\nit is somewhat tedious if you have a lot\n\n632\n00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.110\nof partition, if you just have one or\ntwo it's not a big deal.\n\n633\n00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.120\nSo you can get in here and\npunch those in, and\n\n634\n00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.330\nHR was the other one, and here we go.\n\n635\n00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.250\nSo now they're permanent.\n\n636\n00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.836\nI just need to save that, and when you\nboot the system it reads that file system\n\n637\n00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:01.557\ntable and it mounts all of those so\nthey'll be available.\n\n638\n00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:05.463\nNow if I reboot, all those discs come\nright back, users will know, hey,\n\n639\n00:32:05.463 --> 00:32:08.928\nif I go to the mount folder I can\nthen find HR and sales and so on, and\n\n640\n00:32:08.928 --> 00:32:12.835\nthey can create shortcuts and things\nin their file browser to make it where\n\n641\n00:32:12.835 --> 00:32:15.725\nthey don't have to remember\nI gotta go to mount.\n\n642\n00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:18.820\nCuz they can just come here,\nbrowse in the mount,\n\n643\n00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.530\nfind the folder,\ndrag it over to their bookmark, and\n\n644\n00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.310\nnow they've got HR right there, or\nmarketing, add that as a bookmark.\n\n645\n00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.200\nAnd so now they don't even have to\nremember that it's in that slash mount\n\n646\n00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.040\nfolder, they just go to the bookmark,\nthey get right there, and\n\n647\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.910\nthe names are meaningful.\n\n648\n00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.542\nThey know exactly what it's\nsupposed to be in each one.\n\n649\n00:32:35.542 --> 00:32:38.545\n&gt;&gt; Does it matter where\nwe mount the disks to?\n\n650\n00:32:38.545 --> 00:32:40.292\n&gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't.\n\n651\n00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:42.500\nIn theory, you can mount them\nwherever you want, right?\n\n652\n00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.020\nNow there is a file system\nhierarchy that we normally honor.\n\n653\n00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.630\nSo, for example, I wouldn't normally\ncreate a folder right off a root and\n\n654\n00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:51.420\nstick it there.\n\n655\n00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.173\nSo, we kinda limit ourselves.\n\n656\n00:32:53.173 --> 00:32:56.320\nYou wouldn't wanna mount it\ninside of /lib or /boot, /proc.\n\n657\n00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.550\nThose are areas that the system is using.\n\n658\n00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.137\nSo that's why they have these other\nfolders, things like /run, /media, /mnt.\n\n659\n00:33:04.137 --> 00:33:05.488\nThose are kinda like safe zones for\n\n660\n00:33:05.488 --> 00:33:08.247\nyou to mount things to and\nyou'll know you won't mess with anything.\n\n661\n00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:10.643\nBut you can mount them to your home\nfolder if you want, if it's just you.\n\n662\n00:33:10.643 --> 00:33:13.729\nThat's a nice way to just get right\nalongside your other documents and stuff.\n\n663\n00:33:13.729 --> 00:33:16.355\nSo you can make use of that way too.\n\n664\n00:33:16.355 --> 00:33:20.534\nBut just be aware, you don't want to mount\non to a folder that already has data in it\n\n665\n00:33:20.534 --> 00:33:22.907\nbecause now that data\nbecomes inaccessible.\n\n666\n00:33:22.907 --> 00:33:25.195\nIt doesn't get deleted, but\nas long as the drive is mounted,\n\n667\n00:33:25.195 --> 00:33:27.360\nyou won't be able to get what\nwas in that original folder.\n\n668\n00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.960\nSo, you typically want to\nmount it to an empty folder\n\n669\n00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.120\nthat's not in use by the system.\n\n670\n00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.090\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n671\n00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.210\nNow we're a little over time, but\nwe have a little bit of time left.\n\n672\n00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.729\nAnything else you'd like to add?\n\n673\n00:33:38.729 --> 00:33:42.670\n&gt;&gt; The key thing here with mounting\nis just remembering to do it.\n\n674\n00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.941\nThe big struggle will usually\nbe permissions, right?\n\n675\n00:33:44.941 --> 00:33:48.082\nSo, everything I've shown you here is\nwhat it takes to get the disk mounted and\n\n676\n00:33:48.082 --> 00:33:51.190\nget it online, and if you're an\nadministrator it's gonna work perfectly.\n\n677\n00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.235\nBut for non-administrative users,\nyou're gonna have to go into permissions.\n\n678\n00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:58.485\nOn Ubuntu, on Red Hat, on Fedora,\nyou've gotta check permissions.\n\n679\n00:33:58.485 --> 00:34:01.555\nBut on the Red Hat OSes,\nyou've also got SELinux to deal with.\n\n680\n00:34:01.555 --> 00:34:04.615\nSo make sure you double check\nthat too if you're using it and\n\n681\n00:34:04.615 --> 00:34:05.815\nmake sure it gets configured properly.\n\n682\n00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:08.167\nSo there's a little more leg\nwork depending on your distro.\n\n683\n00:34:08.167 --> 00:34:11.883\nBut everything you've seen here are the\nbasics to get the disks formatted and\n\n684\n00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.790\nmounted and ready for use.\n\n685\n00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.310\n&gt;&gt; Formatting and mounting disks,\nbecoming a Linux system administrator.\n\n686\n00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:23.780\nAnd there's a lot of video in this library\nin becoming a Linux system administrator.\n\n687\n00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.800\nMake sure you check them all out.\n\n688\n00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.370\nYou'll really be glad you did.\n\n689\n00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.415\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n690\n00:34:28.415 -->

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:17.365\nHello and thank you for choosing ITPROTV\nwhere we help you learn where ever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:21.337\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue warm becoming a Linux system\n\n5\n00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:23.130\nadministrator.\n\n6\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.045\nAnd this episode is gonna be cool\ncuz we're gonna be using LVM.\n\n7\n00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.470\nAnd what's LVM and who can teach it to us?\n\n8\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.105\nWhy, Don Pezet can.\n\n9\n00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:33.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.880\nAnd we've mentioned the LVM\nin a couple of episodes now.\n\n11\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.660\nIt's the Logical Volume Manager.\n\n12\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.010\nAnd up until now every time we've seen\nit it's really just made our screen look\n\n13\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.835\nmessy [LAUGH] But\nit is actually a really neat technology.\n\n14\n00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it allows us to do far\n\n15\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.750\nmore with the partitions and\n\n16\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.210\nvolumes that we have on our hard\ndrive than in a traditional model.\n\n17\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.820\nSo you know it really gives us that\nflexibility to be able to extend out\n\n18\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.820\ndrives, do all sorts of crazy magic.\n\n19\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.880\nThat normally just wouldn't be possible.\n\n20\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.300\nSo, we're trading off a little added\ncomplexity for a lot of added benefit.\n\n21\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.910\nAnd that makes the LVM really cool, so\nit's definitely something you wanna learn\n\n22\n00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.600\nabout and it's what we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.230\n&gt;&gt; So, why would would choose\nthe LVM over a traditional volume?\n\n24\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, now there are still plenty\nof times where a traditional volume is\n\n25\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.160\nperfectly fine, so don't feel\nlike you have to go with the LVM.\n\n26\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.290\nBut if you look at\nthe benefits of the LVM, and\n\n27\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.520\nyou feel like it's something you\ncould leverage, then it really helps.\n\n28\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.810\nFor example, if I have a traditional hard\ndrive, right, I format it just EXT-4,\n\n29\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.610\nand it's just a regular old NBR or\nGPT disk.\n\n30\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.100\nAnd I fill the disk up,\nI run out of space.\n\n31\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.270\nWhat can I do?\n\n32\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.200\nWell, there's not much you can do.\n\n33\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.910\nYou can delete some data,\nthat's an option.\n\n34\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.690\nBut if all your data is important, you\nhave to go and buy a new hard drive that's\n\n35\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.230\nbigger and then you've got to copy all\nyour data over to the new hard drive and\n\n36\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.960\nreplace it, right.\n\n37\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.820\nAnd then you're running on\nthe newer bigger drive.\n\n38\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.170\nIt's kind of a pain.\n\n39\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.270\nWith LVM we don't have to do that.\n\n40\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.070\nWith LVM you leave the original\ndrive right where it is,\n\n41\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420\nyou add your second drive and\nLVM can just combine them.\n\n42\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.120\nAnd now that you've increased\nthe storage and you keep running along,\n\n43\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.830\nyou never actually had\nto move your old data,\n\n44\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.470\nit stays on the drive that is was on,\nLVM, can do that.\n\n45\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.500\nWhat if you, you have a computer, and it\ndoesn't have a rate controller in it but\n\n46\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.040\nyou'd love to have a mirror or even\na stripe so your data can be protected so\n\n47\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.160\nthat if a hard drive failed, you'd still\nhave your data on a second hard drive.\n\n48\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.952\nWell, LVM can do that, right.\n\n49\n00:02:24.952 --> 00:02:29.950\nThese are things that\nthe traditional MBR and GPT files,\n\n50\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.190\nfile tables, they really can't\ndo right our partition tables.\n\n51\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.660\nAnd even on the file system side like\next4 is kind of limited in what it can do\n\n52\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.440\nbecause it's just dealing with.\n\n53\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.764\nYou know,\nwhat exists inside of a single partition,\n\n54\n00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:43.373\nnot what happens to that partition.\n\n55\n00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:49.270\nSo LVM really just takes all that and puts\nit on steroids so now we get super powers.\n\n56\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.500\nBut it does make things a lot more complex\nbecause we're not just dealing with\n\n57\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.800\nphysical volumes anymore.\n\n58\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.160\nNow we've got all these logical volumes\nstuffed on top of a management system.\n\n59\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.110\nAnd that can be a little daunting.\n\n60\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.239\nBut I want to show you guys how to get it\nset up, because it's really not that bad.\n\n61\n00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.061\nAnd the odds are,\nif you're running Red Hat or Fedora,\n\n62\n00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:08.545\nyou'll probably already using the LVM for\nyour boot partition, and\n\n63\n00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:11.020\nnow you can just use it on\nyour data discs as well.\n\n64\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.980\nAnd its pretty slick stuff, once you\nfigure it out and see how it works.\n\n65\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.980\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n66\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.100\nAnd that's where you're really\ngoing to leverage this, but\n\n67\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.400\nif you're trying to keep things simple and\nyou're not worried about drive expansion.\n\n68\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.506\nYou're trying to keep things basic and\neasy then you don't want the LVM for that.\n\n69\n00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:28.746\nYou may still use the traditional\njust you out an MBR on there and\n\n70\n00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:30.990\nformat a VXT4 and that's that.\n\n71\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.111\nSo for example, I have the USB\nhard drive that is not here for\n\n72\n00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:38.171\nsome reason, in my office I guess and I\ndon't do [CROSSTALK] I don't do an LVM on\n\n73\n00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:40.750\nanything because it's\njust a removable drive.\n\n74\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.203\nIt's got 1 partition on it and\nif I run a space on it,\n\n75\n00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:47.750\nit's not like I can add\na second drive to my USB thing.\n\n76\n00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.980\nIt's just a little box.\n\n77\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.500\nSo you don't need LVM.\n\n78\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.190\nSo it's not a 100% 1 size\nfits all type solution.\n\n79\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.750\nBut it is pretty powerful in the areas\nwhere you may be able to take advantage\n\n80\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.810\nof those features.\n\n81\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.930\nAlright, so enough about that,\none key thing we need to\n\n82\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.980\nunderstand with LVM when we deploy\nit is that it is different, right?\n\n83\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.100\nSo normally when I come into my system,\nif you take a look at mine and\n\n84\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.740\nI do something like an fdisk -l and\nI take a look of the disks that I've got.\n\n85\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.720\nOops.\n\n86\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.560\nI'm going to be running administrative\ncommands all throughout this episode and\n\n87\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.530\nso I need to sudo this.\n\n88\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.620\nBut to save a little time,\ninstead of sudoing every single command,\n\n89\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.980\nI'm going to go ahead and\ndo sudo -s and switch over to root.\n\n90\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.280\nNot the best security practice, but it'll\nsave a lot of effort here on the show.\n\n91\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.590\nSo I'm going to do an fdisk -l.\n\n92\n00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.960\nAnd what I'm going to see are individual\ndisks that I formatted earlier.\n\n93\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.190\nSo like my /dev/sdd, right,\nthat's a SATA drive.\n\n94\n00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.090\nIt's a 500 gig drive.\n\n95\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.990\nAnd it's got one partition on it,\n/dev/sdd1,right?\n\n96\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.480\nSo if that fills up it's just full and\nthat's the end of it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.550\nThat's not using the LVM, but\nif I look down beneath that look at these\n\n98\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.171\nother disks, /dev/mapper/fedora-root,\n\n99\n00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:04.830\n/dev/mapper/fedora- swab What\nis this /dev /mapper thing?\n\n100\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.470\nWell, that's actually\nthe udev interface for lvm.\n\n101\n00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.210\nLVM is mapping these logical volumes\ninto /dev and using the mapper to do it.\n\n102\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.460\nAnd that's my root petition,\nmy swab, and my home folder.\n\n103\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.030\nWhen I installed Fedora,\nit set up an LVM by default.\n\n104\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.940\nI'm already using it.\n\n105\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.020\nAnd yes,\nit is a little more complex, right?\n\n106\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.580\nEspecially when you look at mount,\nand you look at what's mounted.\n\n107\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.920\nAnything that's using\n/dev/mapper ends up being\n\n108\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.940\nthese giant lines of all sorts\nof extra information in there.\n\n109\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.880\nIt makes things more complex.\n\n110\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.920\nBut at the end of the day it makes it so\nI can grow those partitions,\n\n111\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.240\nI can move them around,\nI can do a lot of really powerful stuff.\n\n112\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.350\nAnd the naming convention is different,\nbut\n\n113\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.330\nin a way the naming convention is\neasier because we have a name.\n\n114\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.090\nLike, when I saw fedora dash home,\nI knew exactly what that was.\n\n115\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.240\nWhen I see slash deb slash SDV1,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n116\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.890\nSo with the complexity comes\na little bit of benefit and\n\n117\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.870\nthat's a key advantage of\nusing something Like LVM.\n\n118\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.640\n&gt;&gt; How do we get started using LVM?\n\n119\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.240\nAre we actually using it, getting\nin there and making it work for us.\n\n120\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Right so technically we're already\nusing it, but that's cheating.\n\n121\n00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.090\nLet's pretend that we're not.\n\n122\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.010\nThat way we don't have LVM at all.\n\n123\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.070\nAnd if you install Ubuntu for\nexample they don't use LVM by default, but\n\n124\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.430\nthey fully support it,\nthey just don't use it by default.\n\n125\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.950\nSo if we want to use the LVM,\nit's actually not that hard.\n\n126\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.860\nThe biggest challenge is gonna be\ngetting your mind wrapped around\n\n127\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.140\nthe concept, right.\n\n128\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.110\nNormally when I run fdisk-l, right,\nI'm looking at all of these volumes.\n\n129\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.660\nWell, these are what are called\nphysical volumes slash dev, slash SDE,\n\n130\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.400\nslash dev, slash SDE.\n\n131\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.550\nThose are physical volumes.\n\n132\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.710\nPhysical hard drives, right?\n\n133\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.450\nI need to create logical volumes,\n\n134\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.800\nlogical volumes are virtual volumes\nthat I can now mess around with.\n\n135\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.210\nI can grow them and\nshrink them and move them and\n\n136\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.210\ndo all the great things with\nit because they're logical.\n\n137\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.410\nSo I need to convert these physical\nvolumes Into logical volumes.\n\n138\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.220\nAnd that's how we start using the LVM.\n\n139\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.680\nWe get our physical disks and\nwe get them ready.\n\n140\n00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.840\nAnd by get them ready, I mean,\njust create a partition on them.\n\n141\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.530\nUse the one big fat\npartition on each disks.\n\n142\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.813\nSo I've got a couple that are set\naside here, SDB, SDC, SDD.\n\n143\n00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:18.800\nSo I've got those three just set aside.\n\n144\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.650\nAnd each one just has a 500\ngig partition on it, and\n\n145\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.650\nI can't remember if I formatted it or not.\n\n146\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.070\nI might have put an EXT 4 format on there.\n\n147\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.930\nIt doesn't matter, what does matter\nis you just need a partition.\n\n148\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.820\nSo if you didn't watch our\npartitioning episode, check that out.\n\n149\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.410\nJust drop one partition\non each of those discs.\n\n150\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.380\nDon't worry about creating smaller\npartitions, just one big one.\n\n151\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.690\nBecause when we create\nthe logical volumes,\n\n152\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.830\nwe can slice this up however we want,\nright?\n\n153\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.790\nSo on the physical disks we\ncreate just one big partition.\n\n154\n00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.800\n&gt;&gt; So logical volume is kinda\nlike having a giant knife?\n\n155\n00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah, you're Slicing it up and\nthat is the old terminology.\n\n156\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.877\nThey used to call it slicing.\n\n157\n00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:56.047\n[LAUGH] But it's kinda evolved a bit,\n\n158\n00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:59.687\nbut basically now that I've got\nthose physical disks ready.\n\n159\n00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:02.107\nI need to put them into the LVM.\n\n160\n00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.150\nWell, actually I'm skipping\nan important step here.\n\n161\n00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.070\nLVM might not be installed on your system.\n\n162\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.770\nIf it's not installed,\nyou probably need to get it installed.\n\n163\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.820\nI was about to run a command and\nthat command might not be there.\n\n164\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.420\nSo if you need to install it on a Red Hat\nbased system, you can do yum install Lvm2.\n\n165\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.290\nMake sure you do that two right, because\nthere's the original version of lvm and\n\n166\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.060\nthere's the new version.\n\n167\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.080\nThe new version is far more awesome than\nthe original one, so you want to do lvm2.\n\n168\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.990\nSo yum install, if you're on\nFedora it'll be dnf install lvm2.\n\n169\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.375\nAnd Ubuntu or, Mint,\nthose guys who would be apt-getinstall.\n\n170\n00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:39.080\nAnd it's going to reach out there and\nget it now I'm running Fedora so\n\n171\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.880\nit's got it installed by default,\ncause it kind of already sought, but\n\n172\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.680\nif you look at the packages there's LVM 2.\n\n173\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.130\nThat's kind of important.\n\n174\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.990\nBut all these other ones\nare the device mapper, right.\n\n175\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.480\nThat's going to be able map this\nstuff to interface with U DAB, so\n\n176\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.760\nthat's all kind of important.\n\n177\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.125\nBut, that's going to make sure that I've\ngot LVM installed and available to use.\n\n178\n00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:59.375\nAnd then I'm ready to\nactually fire this thing up.\n\n179\n00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:02.815\nNow the first thing that I need to\ndo is I need to tell the LVM which\n\n180\n00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:05.315\nphysical disks it's allowed to use.\n\n181\n00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:10.295\nSo I do that by using\nthe pvcreate command all right.\n\n182\n00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:13.605\nIn the logical volume manager you've\ngot three different types of entities.\n\n183\n00:09:13.605 --> 00:09:15.370\nYou've got physical volumes.\n\n184\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.110\nYou have logical volumes, and\nthen you have volume groups, right.\n\n185\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.010\nSo, LV's, PV's and VG's.\n\n186\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.410\nAll the commands start\nwith those two letters.\n\n187\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.700\nIf you are working with physical volumes\nevery command you run will start with PV.\n\n188\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.980\nIf I'm working with volume groups,\nevery command I run will start with VG.\n\n189\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.810\nAnd if I'm working with logical volumes,\nevery command starts with LV.\n\n190\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.340\nSo, I'm doing pvcreate I need\nto create a physical volume.\n\n191\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.560\nWell you can't just create\na physical thing out of nothing.\n\n192\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.570\nSo I'm saying,\nI already have the physical volumes.\n\n193\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.540\nI need to add them to the lvm.\n\n194\n00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.969\nSo I'm gonna say pvcreate/dev/sdb1.\n\n195\n00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:52.890\nRight, notice how I'm pointing\nto the partition, not the disc.\n\n196\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.550\nRight, don't point to /dev/sdb.\n\n197\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.270\nIt's got to be the partition that's\non there, that's why I said,\n\n198\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.440\nyou need to create at least\none partition ahead of time.\n\n199\n00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.870\nAnd I can do more than one disk,\nlike I'll do /dev/sdc1 also, right?\n\n200\n00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.315\nSo I'm telling the lvm that\nit's allowed to use those.\n\n201\n00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:09.975\nAnd it looks like I did format them.\n\n202\n00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:13.395\nSo it sees they're already formatted\nit's gonna erase them right.\n\n203\n00:10:13.395 --> 00:10:16.245\nIt needs the partition\ndoesn't need the file system\n\n204\n00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:18.625\nLVM kind of does its own thing\nwe'll see a little bit later.\n\n205\n00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:22.605\nSo I'm gonna go and say yes that it's\nokay to wipe it for both of those and so\n\n206\n00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:23.315\nit's gonna erase.\n\n207\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.430\nAnd once that's done,\nsee how it says physical volume created?\n\n208\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.470\nI did get a DBUS warning there about\na notification, and it's telling me that\n\n209\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.540\nsystem D, for whatever reason,\ndidn't pick up the LVM DBUS.\n\n210\n00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.320\nI'm not too worried about that just yet.\n\n211\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.940\nWe'll see if that actually\nbecome a problem later.\n\n212\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.520\nWhen you mess with partitions,\nsometimes you actually need to reboot for\n\n213\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.200\nthem to take effect, and so\nI might be in that situation.\n\n214\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.780\nBut it did successfully create them, so\nI don't think I need to worry about that.\n\n215\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.740\nOtherwise, a reboot will take care\nof that error and get you by.\n\n216\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.010\nOr you can run partprobe sometimes,\nand that'll help also.\n\n217\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.490\nBut usually reboot's the way to go.\n\n218\n00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.655\nAll right now, I feel like it created\nit even though I got an error.\n\n219\n00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:04.180\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n220\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.720\n&gt;&gt; How do I know?\n\n221\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.800\nWell I use pvcreate.\n\n222\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.765\nI can also use pvdisplay.\n\n223\n00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:13.770\nPvdisplay will let me know whether or\nnot it got them.\n\n224\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.680\nSure enough I can see SDC 1 and\nSDB 1 right there.\n\n225\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.050\nThey've been brought in.\n\n226\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.350\nI see their size.\n\n227\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.580\nThey're 500 gigs each, and\nthey're now a part of the LVM.\n\n228\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.400\nSo that's good.\n\n229\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.020\n&gt;&gt; Great!\n&gt;&gt; So it did work.\n\n230\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.020\nNow from here,\nI've created my physical volumes.\n\n231\n00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.340\nI've told the LVM it's allowed\nto use these two disks.\n\n232\n00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.260\nNow, I need to create what's\ncalled a volume group.\n\n233\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.570\nI've only got two disks, but in theory,\nyou could have a hundred disks.\n\n234\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.780\nAnd I could take those disks and\ngroup them together.\n\n235\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.060\nI might have some disks that\nare 15,000 RPM scuzzy drives.\n\n236\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.820\nReally expensive.\n\n237\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.740\nReally fast.\n\n238\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.860\nSo I put them in one volume group.\n\n239\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.010\nAnd then I might have other ones that\nare SATA disks that are really slow, but\n\n240\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.880\nthey're cheap, right, so\nI can have a lot of them.\n\n241\n00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.580\nAnd I put those in another volume group.\n\n242\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.205\nI divide them into volume groups so\nthat when I apportion space to somebody,\n\n243\n00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:06.445\nI can pick what type of\nspace that's going to be.\n\n244\n00:12:06.445 --> 00:12:08.155\nIs it gonna be on fast, high tiered disk?\n\n245\n00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:08.975\nIs it gonna be on SSD?\n\n246\n00:12:08.975 --> 00:12:11.195\nI can do that by using volume groups.\n\n247\n00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:13.605\nNow since I've only got two disks,\nI only need one volume group,\n\n248\n00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:15.005\nI can just lump all this together.\n\n249\n00:12:15.005 --> 00:12:17.065\nSo I'm gonna create a volume group, and\n\n250\n00:12:17.065 --> 00:12:18.885\nyou can probably guess what\nthe command for that is.\n\n251\n00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:23.220\nIt's going to be vgcreate for\n\n252\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.110\nthe physical disks and\nI'll do vgcreate for the volume group.\n\n253\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.860\nI'll do lvcreate for\nthe logical volume share in a minute.\n\n254\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.960\nSo, I'm gonna create a volume group and\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n255\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.910\nThe default name is just vg1.\n\n256\n00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.060\nSo I'll create a group called vg1.\n\n257\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.990\nVolume group 1.\n\n258\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.760\nI need to tell it which disks are going\nto be a part of that volume group.\n\n259\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.969\nI'll just add /dev/sdb1, and /dev/sdc1.\n\n260\n00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:50.090\nAll right, so\nwe'll get those punched in there.\n\n261\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.920\nAnd there's that dbus warning again.\n\n262\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.940\nBut it did tell me that the vg1\nwas successfully created.\n\n263\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.840\nI can use vgdisplay to make sure\nthat it did actually get created.\n\n264\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.320\nAnd sure enough, I can see it, so I'm\nnot so worried about that DBUS warning.\n\n265\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.840\nI'll ignore that one for now.\n\n266\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.150\nSo I've got that.\n\n267\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.780\nThe volume group is now created.\n\n268\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.360\nNow, the neat part about this is\nthe volume group VG 1, contains two disks,\n\n269\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.440\n500 gigs each.\n\n270\n00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.930\nSo look at the size.\n\n271\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.610\nMy volume group size is one terabyte.\n\n272\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.180\nIt combined the 500 gigs disk to get me\na 999.99 gigabyte disk which we'll go and\n\n273\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.500\ncall a terabyte RAM.\n\n274\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.460\nSo it combined them and\n\n275\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.330\nit like add more disks to it that\nnumber continues to grow right.\n\n276\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.030\nSo let's say that I run out of\nspace on this volume group.\n\n277\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.330\nSo over time I've just been using it and\nI run out of space.\n\n278\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.120\nWell I could always add another\nphysical disk to it and\n\n279\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.800\nnow the size of that volume disk is\ngoing to grow and expand out okay?\n\n280\n00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.520\nBut for right now I've got a terabyte and\nthat's perfectly fine right so\n\n281\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.370\nI've got that volume group created.\n\n282\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.800\nThe next step Is to create my volumes.\n\n283\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.060\nAnd here's where you go back to\nZach's slice comment, right.\n\n284\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.230\nSo I'm going to slice parts\nof this volume group out.\n\n285\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.450\nI've got a terabyte.\n\n286\n00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:08.730\nI can take 10 megabytes, or 100 megabytes,\nor a gigabyte, or 500 gigabytes, whatever.\n\n287\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.050\nI can slice out and\ncreate a logical volume.\n\n288\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.780\nNow each of these discs\nare only 500 gigs in size, but\n\n289\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.730\nI could create a 700\ngig volume if I wanted.\n\n290\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.770\nAnd it would span across those disks.\n\n291\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.630\nAnd it would happen automatically.\n\n292\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.390\nSo I'm gonna do LV create.\n\n293\n00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.470\nAnd with the logical volume,\nI just need to tell it a size.\n\n294\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.960\nSo I'll tell it dash L,\ncapital L for the size.\n\n295\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.140\nIf you don't give it a size\nthat just takes everything, and\n\n296\n00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.960\nthat's not normally what we want.\n\n297\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.480\nI'm gonna create, let's say this is a,\nI want to host my website, and so\n\n298\n00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.460\nI want my website to be on a volume.\n\n299\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.250\nSo I'm just gonna make it somewhat small,\nwe'll do 250 gigs,\n\n300\n00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:48.500\nprobably just do 25 gigs to be honest\nwith you, but I'll do 250 gigs, right.\n\n301\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.850\nSo I'm telling it that it's\ngonna be 250 gigs in size and\n\n302\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.080\nthat it's going to come\nfrom Volume group 1.\n\n303\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.190\nOkay.\n\n304\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.710\nNow, technically that's all I need to do.\n\n305\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.450\nIf I press enter it's going to\ncreate this new logical volume.\n\n306\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.480\nBut it's going to give it\na slightly obnoxious name,\n\n307\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.150\nlike a randomly generated name.\n\n308\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.510\nSo, I always override that.\n\n309\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.170\nI'm going to do a /n and\nI'm going to call it website.\n\n310\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.352\nBecause I want to remember\nwhat the heck this thing is.\n\n311\n00:15:09.352 --> 00:15:12.866\nThe nice thing about this is\nthat we can name it whatever,\n\n312\n00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:18.590\nit doesn't have to be /dev/sdb1,\nnow it'll actually be named website.\n\n313\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.557\nSo I´ll run that and it´s going to go and\ncreate, [LAUGH] my here.\n\n314\n00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:25.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We´ll continue to ignore that because I\n\n315\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.920\ncan run lvdisplay and\nsee if it created it.\n\n316\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.850\nAnd when I run lvdisplay, I´m going to see\nthe Fedora stuff that was already create.\n\n317\n00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.204\nSo I´m going to ignore those and then let\nme just scroll up until I find right here,\n\n318\n00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:39.610\n/dev/vg1/website.\n\n319\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:40.920\nNotice that name.\n\n320\n00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.820\nI'm not even seeing that /dev/mapper.\n\n321\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.147\nRight?\nThis is really easy.\n\n322\n00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:47.568\n/dev where all my devices are, /vg1,\n\n323\n00:15:47.568 --> 00:15:52.200\nbecause I'm in volume group one,\nand then /website.\n\n324\n00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.443\nThat's the volume.\n\n325\n00:15:53.443 --> 00:15:54.612\nThat's super easy to work with.\n\n326\n00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:57.870\nIf I don't want to mount this\nIt's just /de/vg 1/website.\n\n327\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.606\nThat's really easy.\n\n328\n00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:02.940\nYou can still do it through\nthe mapper if you want.\n\n329\n00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.141\nThe mapper name is much,\nmuch longer if we wanted to go that route.\n\n330\n00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.687\nBut looking at it right here,\n/dev/vg1/website,\n\n331\n00:16:10.687 --> 00:16:12.345\nthat's easy to remember, right?\n\n332\n00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:12.923\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n333\n00:16:12.923 --> 00:16:13.820\n&gt;&gt; So, it created it.\n\n334\n00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.630\nIt is 250 GB and\nit is sitting right on that volume group.\n\n335\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.380\nAnd once that's made, you can treat\nthat just like any other volume or\n\n336\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.680\npartition or whatever.\n\n337\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.540\nSo for example, if I want to use it,\nI need to format, right?\n\n338\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.990\nSo, I can do mkfs.ext4.\n\n339\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.730\nAnd I'm gonna drop a ext4\nfile system on it.\n\n340\n00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.800\nAnd I'll point it to /dev/vg1/website.\n\n341\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.940\nAnd that's gonna format it.\n\n342\n00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.460\nAnd there it goes formatting that and\nnow it's done, right?\n\n343\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.020\nNow, it's got an ext4 file system\non it and I can mount it somewhere.\n\n344\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.350\nSo maybe I want to mount it into /mnt, so\nI´ll make a directory called website and\n\n345\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:58.560\nI will mount /dev/vg1/website\ninto /mnt/website and\n\n346\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.610\nnow that that´s done,\n\n347\n00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:07.250\nI can just browse right into that folder\nand I can start working with that data.\n\n348\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.831\nAnd while I´m in there If I\ndo like a df -h, I can\n\n349\n00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:17.310\nfind that mount point right there and see\nhow it shows as being 250 gigs in size.\n\n350\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.130\nI just created a 250 gig drive.\n\n351\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:24.480\nIt's got a little overhead with\nthe lost and found eating 61 mb.\n\n352\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.760\nBut 246 gigs, it's there, it's available.\n\n353\n00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.720\nIt's online and\nit's in that volume group, okay?\n\n354\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.630\nNow, at this point,\nI might need to do some other things.\n\n355\n00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.980\nSo for example, SE Linux isn't gonna\nlet Apache access this folder,\n\n356\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.720\nand so I've got to set permissions.\n\n357\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.000\nI can do CH mod and\nadjust those permissions.\n\n358\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.108\nI can use, well SE Linux,\nI would need to do something like this.\n\n359\n00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:51.895\nSee manage fcontect -a\n\n360\n00:17:51.895 --> 00:17:57.639\n-t httpd_sys_content_\n\n361\n00:17:57.639 --> 00:18:01.753\nt /mnt/website.\n\n362\n00:18:01.753 --> 00:18:04.930\nAll right, so\nwhat that really long command is doing\n\n363\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.570\nis it's telling SE Linux that I'm\ngoing to be hosting a website there.\n\n364\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.040\nSo I need Apache, I need httpd to\nbe able to access that folder.\n\n365\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.143\nThis is the same command I would use if I\nhad just made a regular folder anywhere\n\n366\n00:18:16.143 --> 00:18:16.927\nelse on the drive.\n\n367\n00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:17.782\nAnd then I would need to run that.\n\n368\n00:18:17.782 --> 00:18:22.607\nI would follow that up with\na restorcon/mnt/website, and\n\n369\n00:18:22.607 --> 00:18:26.023\nso it will apply the SE\nline expanded to it.\n\n370\n00:18:26.023 --> 00:18:29.590\nSo we treat it just like any\nother file system here, right?\n\n371\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.880\nIf you're on Ubuntu or Mint,\nthen you don't have C Linux,\n\n372\n00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.740\nyou don't have to worry about it, but\nin Redhat and it's an extra thing we do.\n\n373\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.850\nBut, we would do this whether we were\nmounting in LVM or a regular disk, or\n\n374\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.830\nanything else.\n\n375\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.410\nOnce it's done, though, now it's up, and\n\n376\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.980\nI can configure Apache to start storing\ndata right here in this folder.\n\n377\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.030\nAnd it's being stored inside of a logical\nvolume, on top of a volume group,\n\n378\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.030\non top of a collection of physical\nvolumes, and now I can take advantage of\n\n379\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:59.850\nall the resources and flexibility of LVM,\nbut access it just like any other storage.\n\n380\n00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.460\nWell now, that that's done,\nis there any ongoing maintenance or\n\n381\n00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.700\ntasks that we need to think about for\nthe future?\n\n382\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.300\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n383\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.420\nAs time goes on,\nyou may need to grow this, right?\n\n384\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.730\nI only did 250 gigs of space.\n\n385\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.460\nSo, maybe my website just blows up, goes\nreally big and I need to add more space.\n\n386\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.670\nWell, I already have a terabyte of\nstorage and I only slice 250 gigs.\n\n387\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.240\nSo, I could always expand\nwith what I've got.\n\n388\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.440\nBut, you can add more physical\nvolumes too if you need to.\n\n389\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.590\nSo for example,\nI brought in SDB1 and SDC1.\n\n390\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.730\nSo, let's say I wanna bring in SDD1,\nright?\n\n391\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.570\nI can say pvcreate/dev/sdd1.\n\n392\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.700\nSo, I'm gonna bring that one in.\n\n393\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.120\nIt's got a file system,\nso it's gonna erase it.\n\n394\n00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.700\nAll right?\n\n395\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.510\nSo I'm gonna bring that one in.\n\n396\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:46.820\nAnd when I do PV display,\nthere's actually another command,\n\n397\n00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.640\nPVS, which is like PV shorthand or\n\n398\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.970\nshow, or something, so it gives you\na smaller view than PV display.\n\n399\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.690\nSo, I'll use PVS here.\n\n400\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.170\nSo, SDB 1 and SDC 1.\n\n401\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.770\nSee how they show it as\nbeing in volume group 1.\n\n402\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.420\nThose are the ones I brought in\nat the beginning of the show.\n\n403\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.960\nNow, I´ve got sdd1 that´s not\na part of any volume group.\n\n404\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.300\nSo, I just added 500 gigs more and\nif I do vgs,\n\n405\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:18.720\nI can see vg1 right there showing as\n999.99 gigabytes, or basically a Terabyte.\n\n406\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.570\nI´ve used 250 gigs though.\n\n407\n00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.080\nSo, see here under vfree,\nthe virtual free.\n\n408\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.684\nI've only got 750 gigs virtually free.\n\n409\n00:20:24.684 --> 00:20:30.719\nAll right, but now I can come in and\nI can say vgextendvg1,\n\n410\n00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:35.428\nso I'm going to expand\nout volume group one and\n\n411\n00:20:35.428 --> 00:20:39.315\nI'm going to add /dev/sdd1 to it.\n\n412\n00:20:39.315 --> 00:20:43.250\nOkay, when I run that it's\ngonna expand that out.\n\n413\n00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.817\nIt's gonna grow that volume group.\n\n414\n00:20:44.817 --> 00:20:49.239\nSo now, when I do VGS,\nit shows as being 1.46 terabytes,\n\n415\n00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:54.990\nroughly one and a half terabytes,\nwith 1.22 terrabytes free, right?\n\n416\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.880\nAnd what it did was added\nsdd1 to that volume group.\n\n417\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.420\nSo, I just grew the volume group so\nnow I've got more space available.\n\n418\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.020\nSo that's you can make the volume\ngroup bigger or smaller.\n\n419\n00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.300\nYou take disks out of the volume group.\n\n420\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.870\nIf need be you maybe got\none use spec is going bad.\n\n421\n00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.250\nOr you just do the rotations,\n\n422\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.680\na lot of people replace drives every years\nor on a critical system maybe one year.\n\n423\n00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.950\nSo you can replace it before it fails\ninstead of waiting till it does fail, but\n\n424\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.170\nnow, it's added to the volume group.\n\n425\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.230\nIt's not actually added\nto the logical volume.\n\n426\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:29.910\nIf I do LVS and take a look at my logical\nvolume, It's still only 250 gig in size.\n\n427\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:35.430\nSo, if I want to grow that,\nI can use lvresize and\n\n428\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.060\nI can tell it how much\nI want to grow that by.\n\n429\n00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.950\nSo, maybe I want to grow\nit by another 250 gigs.\n\n430\n00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.407\nSo, I'm gonna add that.\n\n431\n00:21:42.407 --> 00:21:46.320\nI do -L, actually I need to do a little\nplus there because I'm adding 250 gigs.\n\n432\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.392\nIf you don't do the plus, you're just\ntelling it to put it at the size which,\n\n433\n00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.973\nanyhow, [LAUGH] that's under videos.\n\n434\n00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:56.372\nAnd then I tell it what it's gonna\nincrease and it's gonna /dev/vg1/website,\n\n435\n00:21:56.372 --> 00:22:00.860\nand so that's going to reach in there and\nit's going to grow it.\n\n436\n00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.100\nAnd there it goes, and if I do LV\ndisplay or LVS I can see website\n\n437\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.830\nis now 500 gigs instead of 250 gigs,\nI just grew it.\n\n438\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.660\nI doubled its size.\n\n439\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.850\nI didn't have to take it offline,\nI didn't have to unmount it, right.\n\n440\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.430\nThis was done, people could be on my\nwebsite right now, and I just grew it and\n\n441\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.230\nthey don´t even notice.\n\n442\n00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.610\nNow, it´s got twice the space, or I can\ncontinue this, growing it even bigger.\n\n443\n00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.640\nAt no point did I unmount or\ntake this stuff offline.\n\n444\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.070\nThere´s other utilities like resize\n2fs that you can use on non lvm disks,\n\n445\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.030\nbut it takes them offline.\n\n446\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.690\nIt unmounts them while it runs.\n\n447\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.990\nWith the LVM,\nI can even use things like resize 2FS and\n\n448\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.150\nit doesn't take them offline.\n\n449\n00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.730\nAnd that's actually kind of important\nbecause I need to do that here.\n\n450\n00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.400\nIf I do a DF-H and\ntake a look at my discs.\n\n451\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.870\nNotice how website still\nonly shows us 246 gigs.\n\n452\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.940\nI made the logical volume bigger.\n\n453\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.790\nBut the file system doesn't know that yet,\n\n454\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.430\nthe EXT4 file system on it\nthinks it's only 250 gigs.\n\n455\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:04.120\nSo, I need to come in and\nsay resize 2fs /dev/vg1/website.\n\n456\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.350\nAnd by running that it's\n\n457\n00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:12.000\ngoing to tell it to grow it to\nthe largest size, so there it goes.\n\n458\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.490\nReaching out, and it should grow, so\n\n459\n00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.340\nit's telling me the file\nsystem now is a new length.\n\n460\n00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.705\nAnd when I take a look\nat my df output now,\n\n461\n00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:24.590\n/website shows as 493 gigs, it's grown.\n\n462\n00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.300\nRight, again,\nall done while it was online,\n\n463\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.070\npeople could have been in the system\nright now and all that just happened.\n\n464\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.250\nWe just expanded it, it's grown.\n\n465\n00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.840\nIt's, in place the stuff is going,\n\n466\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.900\nthere's not really much more\nwe have to worry about.\n\n467\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.490\nThat's really where\nthe power of LVM comes in,\n\n468\n00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.260\nis it allows you to change\nthose disks on the fly.\n\n469\n00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.534\nNot really something we\nneed to do on a laptop.\n\n470\n00:23:44.534 --> 00:23:46.280\nBut on a server, or even on a desktop,\n\n471\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.158\nlike a workstation where you've got a lot\nof storage, this comes in really handy and\n\n472\n00:23:50.158 --> 00:23:53.340\nthat's where the power of\nLVM really comes to play.\n\n473\n00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.311\nWell now the mount is temporary\nat this point, right?\n\n474\n00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:57.630\nSo how do we make it primitive?\n\n475\n00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is just like our\nphysical disks from the earlier\n\n476\n00:24:00.349 --> 00:24:04.118\nepisodes where the mounts that I've done\nlike mounting it the website folder that's\n\n477\n00:24:04.118 --> 00:24:05.080\ntemporary, right?\n\n478\n00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.680\nIf I reboot, I'm gonna lose it.\n\n479\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.480\nSo I do need to add this to f style,\nit is there file system table.\n\n480\n00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.430\nNow what is a little tricky is,\nthe mapper that runs,\n\n481\n00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.280\nthat's mapping this to /dev/vg1/website,\n\n482\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.690\nit hasn't really started at boot time yet.\n\n483\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.310\nSo when I go to mount this,\nI want to mount it to its true full name,\n\n484\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.050\nwhich gets a little bit confusing.\n\n485\n00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.540\nBut if you go to /dev/mapper\nyou can take a look in there,\n\n486\n00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.740\nand you'll see the various names.\n\n487\n00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.870\nAnd notice how there's vg1- website.\n\n488\n00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:46.600\nThat's actually the true name of that,\nfile.\n\n489\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.750\nBut that's the true name of\nthe logic volume that I created.\n\n490\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.412\nSo we put it in F STAB,\nthat's really what we want to map to,\n\n491\n00:24:54.412 --> 00:24:57.220\n/dev/mapper/ vg1-website.\n\n492\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.670\nSo a little bit different than what\nI've been working with here kind of\n\n493\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:06.510\ntemporarily, but I would basically\njust go and edit, /etc/fstab, and\n\n494\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.360\nI would come down to the end of the line\nhere and I would just add another entry,\n\n495\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:17.470\nand I would just say,\n/dev /mapper /vg1-website.\n\n496\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.890\nI'm gonna mount that to /mount/website.\n\n497\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:29.820\nIt's ext4, I'll use the default\noptions and we'll set it to 1 and 2.\n\n498\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.815\nOne lets the dump command back it\nup if we actually use dump and\n\n499\n00:25:32.815 --> 00:25:36.630\ntwo says check it after you check the root\nfile system if you're looking for errors.\n\n500\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.790\nSo by setting that up, now when I reboot,\nthat'll be mounted and\n\n501\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.510\nit'll be available and it'll be permanent.\n\n502\n00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.020\nSo just like any of our other systems,\nwe need to make this one permanent.\n\n503\n00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.300\nOtherwise, you have some unscheduled\nreboot or even a schedules reboot,\n\n504\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.140\nyou're doing updates and now your website\ndoesn't work, cuz you didn't mount back.\n\n505\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a few steps.\n\n506\n00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.520\nI mean it is.\n\n507\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.640\nBut is it hard to tear apart you\ndecided you wanted to tear it apart?\n\n508\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you might need to do that.\n\n509\n00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.900\nMaybe you've moved off to another server,\nyou want to free these disks up.\n\n510\n00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.320\nIt's actually really easy to\nget all this stuff removed.\n\n511\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.840\nIf you want to get rid of it,\n\n512\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.360\nthe first thing you need to do\nis you need to unmount the disk.\n\n513\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.790\nSo I'll do umount /mnt/website.\n\n514\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.960\nAnd we'll get that unmounted, right.\n\n515\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.800\nAnd then from there we remove\nthe pieces in the opposite order we\n\n516\n00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.470\ncreated them, right.\n\n517\n00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.300\nSo before we did the physical volumes,\nthen the volume group,\n\n518\n00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.110\nthen the logical volume.\n\n519\n00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.240\nNow we just go backwards.\n\n520\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.772\nSo I would say, lvremove /dev/vg1/website,\n\n521\n00:26:31.772 --> 00:26:35.520\nso I'm gonna remove that logical volume.\n\n522\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.140\nSo there it goes, right?\n\n523\n00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:43.730\nAnd then, I'll do vgremove/dev/vg1, so I'm\ngoing to remove the volume group, right?\n\n524\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.460\nAnd there it goes.\n\n525\n00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.279\nAnd again,\nwe'll ignore these debug warnings.\n\n526\n00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:49.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got to love system D.\n\n527\n00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.045\nAnd then I will\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it wants you to take the bus.\n\n528\n00:26:52.045 --> 00:26:54.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One way,\n\n529\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.370\nwe're getting thrown under the bus,\nunder the DBUS.\n\n530\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.100\nSo then we do our volume group remove.\n\n531\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.810\nSorry, I already did\nthe volume group remove.\n\n532\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.710\nWe do the physical volume remove.\n\n533\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.670\nI'll do pvremove.\n\n534\n00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.600\nI can remove all those\ndisks all at the same time.\n\n535\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.330\nSo I can just come in and\n\n536\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.560\nlist each one because you might\nactually just be removing one disk.\n\n537\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.980\nYou can certainly do that.\n\n538\n00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.890\nBut, I'm going to remove them all.\n\n539\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.050\nAnd that pulls them out.\n\n540\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.590\nEach one gets removed.\n\n541\n00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.420\nAnd now if I do a PVS,\n\n542\n00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.940\nI still have a physical volume\nbecause of the Fedora install.\n\n543\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.890\nIt had its own, right.\n\n544\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.060\nSo that's the Fedora volume group.\n\n545\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.980\nIf I do the volume group status or\nshow, I can see there's Fedora.\n\n546\n00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:36.650\nAnd that's it.\n\n547\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:40.330\nAnd if I do LVS, I just see the Fedora\nones might have all been removed.\n\n548\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.310\nSo really just a couple\nof quick commands there.\n\n549\n00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.890\nThat was LV remove,\nVG remove, and PV remove.\n\n550\n00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.130\nGets those out of there,\nand now LVM is gone.\n\n551\n00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.760\nIf I'm really done with\nit I can uninstall LVM,\n\n552\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.950\nI can't because fedora is installed in it.\n\n553\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.455\nBut, if you weren't using it anymore,\nyou could just do a yum erase LVM 2 or\n\n554\n00:27:57.455 --> 00:28:04.755\napp/get remove LVM 2 or whatever it is\nthat you need from your disk drive.\n\n555\n00:28:04.755 --> 00:28:06.400\n&gt;&gt; LVM seems like it would be a big help.\n\n556\n00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.390\nIt could be a really big\nhelp to you in your work.\n\n557\n00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.430\nAnything else you would\nlike to add real quick?\n\n558\n00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Really, I really just scratched\nthe surface here in this episode.\n\n559\n00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.790\nSo be aware, you can do a lot more with\nLVM, you can create ray arrays with it,\n\n560\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.720\nyou can do a lot of other fancy things.\n\n561\n00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.410\nYou can even mount\nnetwork storage into it.\n\n562\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.559\nIt´s got some really powerful\nfeatures that are out there.\n\n563\n00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:31.410\nBut if you're doing\nsomething brand new today,\n\n564\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:36.370\nLVM, it's already kind of got\na timer on it's life time because\n\n565\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:41.630\nBTRFS incorporates all these LVM\nfeatures right into it's file system.\n\n566\n00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.940\nSo in a few years BTRFS will\nreplace the need for LVM.\n\n567\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.770\nSo some of you that are moving in that\ndirection, you'll want to think about\n\n568\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.160\nBTRFS but in the enterprise world,\nif you're using an enterprise supported\n\n569\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.120\nplatform, then VTRSF is still years\naway before you'll have that.\n\n570\n00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.130\nSo LVM is going to be the method\nthat you use in most businesses.\n\n571\n00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.856\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n572\n00:29:00.856 --> 00:29:06.420\nUsing LVM becoming a Linux system\nadministrator, and there's a lot of videos\n\n573\n00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.652\nin this series, so make sure you watch\nthem all, you'll be very glad you did.\n\n574\n00:29:09.652 --> 00:29:10.900\nDon, wonderful job as usual.\n\n575\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.850\nThank you so much, and\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n576\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.056\nremember, a good ITPro is always learning,\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n577\n00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:18.890\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n578\n00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.644\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you very
