All right, so Becoming a Linux\nSystem Administrator is a course that's\n\n6\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.370\ndesigned to really take your skills with\nLinux and move them up to the next level.\n\n7\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.580\nA lot of people use Linux as an operating\nsystem, and it's used on servers across\n\n8\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720\nthe world, a lot of the Internet\nservices we access use Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.070\nBut even on the desktop,\nthere's plenty of people like me,\n\n10\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.986\nwhere I'm running Linux right here\non my own desktop, and that's great.\n\n11\n00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:38.230\nIf you're just an individual,\nit works really well.\n\n12\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.563\nBut when you move into the business world,\nand now you're managing desktops and\n\n13\n00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.067\nlaptops for hundreds, thousands,\ntens of thousands of users,\n\n14\n00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.438\nthings are a little bit different, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.629\nIf I just wanna install software for\nmyself, that's no big deal, but\n\n16\n00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.985\nif I wanna install software for\n100 people, that's much different,\n\n17\n00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:57.170\nit's a different type of experience.\n\n18\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.663\nAnd so in the Becoming\na Linux System Administrator series.\n\n19\n00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:03.582\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's tough.\n\n20\n00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:06.120\n[LAUGH] In this series,\n\n21\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.180\nwe take a look at what those skills are,\nhow things are different.\n\n22\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.010\nReally, we can almost call this\nseries Linux in the Business, right?\n\n23\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.800\nInstead of using it for\na personal computer or\n\n24\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.170\njust as a hobbyist type thing,\nhow is it used in a business?\n\n25\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.000\nAnd how is that different than\nadministering a system just for ourselves?\n\n26\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.093\nAnd that's really what we'll get a chance\nto see right here in this series.\n\n27\n00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:28.946\n&gt;&gt; And Don, who would benefit\nmost from watching the Becoming\n\n28\n00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:31.280\na Linux System Administrator series?\n\n29\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, really, anybody who uses Linux\nwould benefit from it, but really,\n\n30\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.260\nit's gonna be people using\nLinux in the workplace.\n\n31\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.930\nThere's some of the things we learn,\n\n32\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.030\nlike configuring multiple\nuser accounts on a system.\n\n33\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.950\nWell, if it's your home computer, you're\nprobably the only person who uses it,\n\n34\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.940\nyou're not gonna need\nmultiple user accounts.\n\n35\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.430\nBut in a workplace,\nit's very common to have shared computers,\n\n36\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.940\nwhere you might have ten different\nemployees that could sit down and\n\n37\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.700\nuse a computer at a particular time.\n\n38\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.420\nAnd that's something we have to support.\n\n39\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.478\nSo if you're using Linux in the workplace,\nthis series is really gonna benefit you.\n\n40\n00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:05.950\nNow, if you're a home user, but you're\nthinking about getting a job supporting\n\n41\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.390\nLinux in the workplace, then again, this\nis gonna be a great skill set to have,\n\n42\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.080\nthat you'll be able to use when you\nget out there in the workforce.\n\n43\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.510\nSo either side can benefit,\n\n44\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780\nbut really, it is geared towards people\nsupporting Linux in the workplace.\n\n45\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.797\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nis there a certification that you can get?\n\n46\n00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:21.449\n&gt;&gt; There are a number of\ncertifications that are out there, but\n\n47\n00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.940\nthis particular series\nisn't built around them.\n\n48\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.540\nWe wanted to focus specifically on the\nskills that you needed to support Linux\n\n49\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.800\nfrom that system administrator type role.\n\n50\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.217\nThere are certifications, like the CompTIA\nLinux+ and the LPIC-1 certification,\n\n51\n00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:37.710\nthat both cover everything I'm\ngonna cover here in this series.\n\n52\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.820\nBut they cover a lot more, also,\nthey go well beyond it, and so\n\n53\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.410\nthey're really designed for\nmore advanced Linux users.\n\n54\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.027\nIf you're just getting started\nin system administration,\n\n55\n00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:45.828\nthat can be really daunting.\n\n56\n00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:49.174\nSo we wanted to focus on the core\ntasks that were really important,\n\n57\n00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:53.150\nthe things that, really, you need\nto know out there in the workplace.\n\n58\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.710\nAnd then once you've got a grasp of that\nand a firm understanding, then you can\n\n59\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.520\nstart studying the more advanced things\nand move on to those other certifications.\n\n60\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.000\nWe've already got those courses\non the ITProTV site, so for\n\n61\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.910\nthose of you who are ready for\nthat, you can jump right to it.\n\n62\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.380\nBut for everybody else,\nthis is where we'll want to start.\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.760\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhat topics are covered in this series?\n\n64\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we cover a lot of neat\nthings, and this is an evolving course, so\n\n65\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.170\nwe can always add more things to it later.\n\n66\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.360\nBut the core things that\nwe're gonna cover are,\n\n67\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.990\nfirst off, learning system administration.\n\n68\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.620\nSo what do we mean by\nsystem administration, and\n\n69\n00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.720\nwhy is that different than\non a personal computer?\n\n70\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.060\nThen we'll take a look\nat installing Linux.\n\n71\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.250\nI know it seems like installing Linux is\npretty easy, you boot the computer up and\n\n72\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.407\nyou press next 15 times.\n\n73\n00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:32.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n74\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.443\nthere's a lot of choices you can\nmanipulate in there that change the way\n\n75\n00:03:35.443 --> 00:03:38.840\nthe computer behaves, and so we're gonna\ntake a look at how that gets installed.\n\n76\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.260\nThen we'll take a look at getting and\n\n77\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.770\nmanaging software, how we load software on\nthe system, how we keep it up to date, and\n\n78\n00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.830\nhow we can manage that and\ncontrol people's access to it.\n\n79\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.560\nThen we take a look at\nmanaging user accounts.\n\n80\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.068\nI mentioned in the workplace,\nit's not uncommon to have shared systems.\n\n81\n00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:56.097\nSo how do we control user access, and\nrestrict access to some people and\n\n82\n00:03:56.097 --> 00:03:57.780\nallow access to others?\n\n83\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.305\nWe'll get a chance to see that.\nAnd then finally,\n\n84\n00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:03.837\nwe'll talk about managing disks and file\nsystems, how we control the way that our\n\n85\n00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:08.236\nhard drives are presented to the operating\nsystem, who has access to what, and\n\n86\n00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:11.080\nthe other resources that\nare found inside of that.\n\n87\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.312\nSo all of this is kinda pertaining to\nkeeping our system up and running, and\n\n88\n00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:17.543\nhealthy, and the things that we do in\nthe workplace, things like adding or\n\n89\n00:04:17.543 --> 00:04:20.555\nreplacing a hard drive, and\nhow that's reflected inside of the OS.\n\n90\n00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:24.370\nThose are things we need to know if we're\ngoing to be a system administrator.\n\n91\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.630\n&gt;&gt; So if Becoming a Linux System\nAdministrator sounds interesting to you,\n\n92\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.850\nmake sure you check out all the videos,\nall the lessons in the series.\n\n93\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.172\nThank you for watching.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
