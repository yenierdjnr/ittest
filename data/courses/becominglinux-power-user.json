This is a pretty neat course, because\nit is designed to get users introduced to\n\n7\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.160\nhow powerful an operating system Linux is.\n\n8\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.740\nA lot people hear about\nthe Linux Operating System and\n\n9\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.750\nthey wanna learn more.\n\n10\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.540\nThey go and they install it, they get\na nice little graphical user interface.\n\n11\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.450\nAnd they give you the basic things that\nthey're used to from other operating\n\n12\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.580\nsystems like Microsoft Windows and\nMAC OS and operating systems like that.\n\n13\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580\nBut you hear about how powerful it can be.\n\n14\n00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.530\nAll this extra stuff, and\nyou don't immediately see it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.230\nSo in this series,\n\n16\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.180\nwhat we're trying to do is pull back\nthe veil and give us a chance to look\n\n17\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.032\nat some of the really cool things you\ncan do behind the scenes, and it's hard.\n\n18\n00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:53.830\nIt's a challenging stuff, it's not stuff\nyou can just figure out on your own.\n\n19\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.880\nSo, getting a change to get\na guided tour through some\n\n20\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.560\nof the powerful back-end\nfeatures inside of Linux.\n\n21\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.170\nIs a really great thing to do,\nespecially if you're getting started.\n\n22\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.580\nAnd that's exactly what this episode,\nor this series, is all about.\n\n23\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.950\n&gt;&gt; Now, who would benefit most from\nwatching, becoming a Linux power user?\n\n24\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, mostly it's going to\nbenefit people who are new to Linux.\n\n25\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880\nIf you've worked with Linux for\na long time,\n\n26\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.000\nif you've been using it in the field,\nyou may well already know these topics, so\n\n27\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.270\nit might be a little boring to you.\n\n28\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.060\nBut if you're just getting started it\nis really daunting, really challenging.\n\n29\n00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.010\nAnd instead of getting intimidated and\njust going back to Windows or going back\n\n30\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.770\nto Mac OS, here is the chance for you to\ntake that time to learn the features,\n\n31\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.940\nget used to it, understand how it works.\n\n32\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.510\nSo if you're just getting started\nwith Linux, if you are a desktop\n\n33\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.980\nsupport engineer, if you are a systems\nadministrator, that you're gonna\n\n34\n00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.340\nbe managing the Linux Operating System,\nthis is good knowledge to learn.\n\n35\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.290\nAnd what we're gonna see in this series\npertains to servers as well as work\n\n36\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.820\nstations, so\nif you're working in either environment,\n\n37\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.290\nyou'll benefit from this series as well.\n\n38\n00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.900\nSo, it really does cover\na good group of people.\n\n39\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.840\n&gt;&gt; Now, is there a certification\navailable for this course?\n\n40\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.000\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of really good Linux\ncertifications that are out there,\n\n41\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.950\nmany of which cover some of the topics\nwe're gonna cover in this series.\n\n42\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.150\nBut this series isn't really\nbuilt around a search.\n\n43\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.930\nSo there's no exam based on this content,\nfor what we're creating here.\n\n44\n00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.230\nThis is really focused, not to get you\na certification to get you a job, but\n\n45\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.950\nto get you comfortable with Linux and\nbecoming that power user.\n\n46\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.360\nSo we tackle exactly what\nwe think is pertinent and\n\n47\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.290\nrelevant to a power user\nto get you to that point.\n\n48\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.180\nOn one hand, it's really nice because\nthat means we're not saddled by\n\n49\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.470\na list of objectives we have to follow.\n\n50\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.710\nWe get to hand pick what\nwe think is important.\n\n51\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.410\nOn the other hand, it's a little more\ndifficult to kind of show on the resume.\n\n52\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.660\nSo what a lot of people do is watch\na series like this to get started.\n\n53\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.583\nAnd then move on to do things\nlike CompTIA's Linux+ or\n\n54\n00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.650\nthe LPIC-1 certification.\n\n55\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.680\nThose certifications cover a lot of\nthe topics that we're gonna see here\n\n56\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.500\nin this series.\n\n57\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.140\nBut they're not mirrored up exactly,\nso these here won't get you ready for\n\n58\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.070\nthose exams.\n\n59\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.930\n&gt;&gt; So what are some of the topics\ncovered in becoming a Linux power user?\n\n60\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, we've got quite a few and\n\n61\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.510\nthe very first topic's probably the most\nimportant one, which is using the shell.\n\n62\n00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.320\nWhen you first launch a Linux desktop,\n\n63\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.570\nyou're gonna see\na graphical user interface.\n\n64\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.000\nAnd a graphical user interface is\nsomething you can stumble through and\n\n65\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.660\nfigure out on your own.\n\n66\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.800\nYou just click around until\nyou find what you want.\n\n67\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.290\nBut the shell, when you drop to\nthe command line there is so\n\n68\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.890\nmuch more you can do,\nbut it's so much harder.\n\n69\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.640\nAnd you can't just stumble around and\nfigure it out.\n\n70\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.820\nSo we're gonna learn how to use the shell.\n\n71\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.460\nWe're gonna learn how to\nnavigate the Unix and\n\n72\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.090\nLinux file system, which is very\ndifferent than the Windows file system.\n\n73\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.920\nWe'll talk about how to work\nwith text files, because almost\n\n74\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.790\nall of the Linux Operating System\nconfigurations are stored in text files.\n\n75\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.525\nWe need to know how to manipulate those,\nand edit, change them.\n\n76\n00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:29.710\nThen we're gonna take a look\nto how to manage processes,\n\n77\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.860\nhow to run applications,\nhow to make them perform better,\n\n78\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.610\nhow to stop them if they're not performing\nright and manipulate how they work.\n\n79\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.023\nAnd lastly, we're gonna learn how\nto write simple shell script.\n\n80\n00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:43.232\nShell scripting is really where a lot of\nthe power of the Linux Operating System\n\n81\n00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:43.944\ncomes from.\n\n82\n00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:48.530\nThe Linux OS was designed by\ndevelopers for developers.\n\n83\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.080\nAnd it's evolved a lot since then, so\nthat now it's good for everybody to use.\n\n84\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.560\nBut if we know how to do a little bit of\ndevelopment, we could take advantage of\n\n85\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.170\nthat and really streamline our\nworkflow by using shell scripts.\n\n86\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.220\nSo that's what we'll take a look\nat at the end of the series.\n\n87\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks, Don.\n\n88\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.040\nNow, if this sounds like something that\nyou'd be interested in, and it should,\n\n89\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.220\nyou should check out all the episodes in\nthe Becoming a Linux Power User series.\n\n90\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.384\nThanks for watching.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
