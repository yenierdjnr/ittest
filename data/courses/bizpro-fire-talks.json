Hi, thanks for joining us on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.976\nI'm Joshua Marpet, and\nthis is Scott Lyons, we're from Red Lion.\n\n6\n00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:22.380\nWe're gonna do a quick-fire talk on\nlow-cost resources for small business.\n\n7\n00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.522\nSo, Scott, start us off, what kind\nof resources are we talking about?\n\n8\n00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, in small businesses,\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.283\na lot of small businesses\nreally rely on communication.\n\n10\n00:00:30.283 --> 00:00:34.744\nThey rely on project management, a little\nbit of document management because, hey,\n\n11\n00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.280\nyou need a place to be\nable to put your stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what kind of resources\nwould you use for communication?\n\n13\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, personally my personal favorite,\nnot gonna lie,\n\n14\n00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.810\nI break the holy truth of communication\ndon'ts, and that's using Facebook.\n\n15\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.160\nRealistically, you shouldn't do that, but\nI am a huge, huge breaker of that rule,\n\n16\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.440\nonly because everybody that\nI know is there, so why not?\n\n17\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.033\nVersus having Slack, right?\n\n18\n00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.610\n&gt;&gt; That's true because, with Slack,\nyou have to be on a specific team.\n\n19\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.291\nWith Gtalk, you have to know which\naddress they have their Gtalk set up on.\n\n20\n00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.980\nWith Facebook, everybody's right there,\nthey're all in the same sort of grouping.\n\n21\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.130\nAnd if they're a friend of yours, you can\nimmediately message them and talk to them.\n\n22\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.136\nBut it's monitored, it's subpoenable,\nit's easily get at people.\n\n23\n00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:23.504\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n24\n00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:26.152\nSo we recommend anything but Facebook.\n\n25\n00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:30.352\nSignal, Slack, Gmail any of those things,\nplease use them instead of\n\n26\n00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:36.018\nFacebook Messenger, but if you have to, as\nScott apparently always does, it's there.\n\n27\n00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nyou also have to remember, though,\n\n28\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.440\nit comes down to the level\nof communication.\n\n29\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.490\nIf you're talking about\ncompany trade secrets,\n\n30\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.960\nyou sort of want an encrypted chat.\n\n31\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.919\nFacebook is not what you wanna use.\n\n32\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.520\nAin't that the truth?\n\n33\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n34\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.412\n&gt;&gt; But in being able to talk to\npeople about communication also\n\n35\n00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.372\ncomes project management.\n\n36\n00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:58.865\nSo for you,\nwhen we're going through projects,\n\n37\n00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:02.820\nwhat do you like to use\nto manage the projects?\n\n38\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.310\n&gt;&gt; So in actuality,\nthere's several things that I've used.\n\n39\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.160\nI've used Trello, I've used Producteev.\n\n40\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.890\nFor BSides Delaware, the conference that\nI run, we use Producteev and Trello.\n\n41\n00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.250\nFor my house,\nmy wife setup a Trello board, so\n\n42\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.025\nI would have a honey do\nlist that was perfect.\n\n43\n00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:19.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Everything from taking out the garbage\n\n44\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560\nto folding the laundry to fixing\nthe plumbing is on our Trello list for\n\n45\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.100\nthe house.\n\n46\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.770\nEvernote is a great one because it allows\nyou to put snippets of web pages and\n\n47\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.890\neverything else in there.\n\n48\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.740\nIt depends.\n\n49\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.330\nTrello is a Kanban board, or\nthink of Post-it notes on a white board.\n\n50\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.745\nProducteev is more project based like\nAsana where you have tasks that tricked\n\n51\n00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:43.415\ntogether or linked together to do the task\none, then task two, then task three.\n\n52\n00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.205\nSo it depends, but\nall of these are free versions.\n\n53\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:47.165\nSo it's very,\nvery low cost and very simple.\n\n54\n00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\na lot of the free versions follow the same\n\n55\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.040\ntheory of project management,\nwhether it's the hybrid model,\n\n56\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.080\nthe DevOps model, the Waterfall model,\nthey're all baked into these systems.\n\n57\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.770\nAnd that's really what's most important is\nthat they're flexible for your business.\n\n58\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, because,\nif you're an Agile firm.\n\n59\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.810\nIf you do Agile development, you're gonna\nwant to use a Kanban board like Trello or\n\n60\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.290\nyou're gonna want to use,\nif you're Waterfall,\n\n61\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.020\nyou're gonna want to use\na Waterfall-based system or\n\n62\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.520\nsomething that's Waterfall sort of\nbaked into its genes, like Producteev.\n\n63\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.790\nYou can do Agile on Producteev, but\nit's a little different to set up.\n\n64\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.300\nBut again, even to do these things,\n\n65\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.041\nyou've gotta figure out where\nyou're gonna save all your stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:25.308\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually a really good\npoint, because it brings us into the next\n\n67\n00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:28.490\npart of our discussion here which\nis document management, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.500\nNow me personally,\nI love using Google Docs.\n\n69\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.770\nGoogle Docs for everything.\n\n70\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.240\nIt makes things really simple.\n\n71\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.360\nThe cost benefit value is there,\nespecially for\n\n72\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.950\na small business that might not have\naccess to enterprise level resources.\n\n73\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, except that Google Docs\nis a nightmare to keep organized,\n\n74\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.180\nbecause if you create it or I created it,\nit's now in different folders.\n\n75\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.150\nAnd if we have folders of the same name,\nit's impossible to merge them together.\n\n76\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.700\nSo one friend of ours, Kevin Johnson from\nSecure Ideas, actually had a great idea.\n\n77\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.040\nHe created a single master folder in\nGoogle Docs and everybody in the firm puts\n\n78\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.110\nall of their things, all of their\ndocuments, in that master folder.\n\n79\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.540\nThat's worked, and we actually have\ndone that with some of our subcompanies.\n\n80\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.560\nAnd some of our subcompanies somebody\nstarted stuff that didn't do that and\n\n81\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.790\nI got a little annoyed with them.\n\n82\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.510\nI'm not saying it was\nanybody in particular,\n\n83\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.130\nI'm just pointing it out, let's say.\n\n84\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.250\nBut there's plenty of document management\nprojects and systems out there.\n\n85\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.693\nThere's Google Docs, there's GitHub,\nthere's Dropbox, there's Citrix.\n\n86\n00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.115\nI forget the shares.\n\n87\n00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:32.666\n&gt;&gt; AWS, you can use the S3 buckets\nin AWS to do storage as well.\n\n88\n00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:33.840\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's correct.\n\n89\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.300\nBut there's lots of them out there.\n\n90\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.080\nAWS actually charges for the S3 buckets,\nso that's technically not free but\n\n91\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.650\nit's relatively inexpensive.\n\n92\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.470\n&gt;&gt; And either way you look at it, you need\nto have security built-in to what you do,\n\n93\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.692\nso you're looking at Google\nauthenticator for your two factor,\n\n94\n00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:53.218\nyou're looking at let's encrypt,\nand https, all the things.\n\n95\n00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:57.390\n&gt;&gt; Well that's https everywhere which is\na project that was started I think by\n\n96\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.510\nGoogle, maybe even Facebook, but you'll\nnotice as you wander around the web these\n\n97\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.140\ndays most every major website is now https\nwith the green padlock on some browsers.\n\n98\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.804\nIf it's not SSL or TLS encrypted,\nto be honest with you,\n\n99\n00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:14.390\nis the correct way to say it, if it's not\nTLS encrypted, you shouldn't be using it.\n\n100\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.932\nIt means you're pushing information\nacross an unsecure connection,\n\n101\n00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:20.960\nthat's an insecure connection that\njust will not secure your information.\n\n102\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.160\nSo you've got to make sure that you're\ntwo-factor, multi-factor in some form or\n\n103\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.750\nfashion, you're getting another factor\nof authentication into your document\n\n104\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.290\nmanagement, into your sales management,\ninto all of the things that you do as\n\n105\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.590\na business, because otherwise\nyou're risking everything you have.\n\n106\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's say you\nwalk down all of these roads.\n\n107\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.168\nYou do all the basics, you've watched\nthe talks that we've put out.\n\n108\n00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:42.997\nAnd you say, hey, I have this\ngreat thing called customers, and\n\n109\n00:05:42.997 --> 00:05:44.840\nnow I have money coming in, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.320\nSo the last two topics that I wanna talk\nabout real quick are, what do we do for\n\n111\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.560\nour customers?\n\n112\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.710\nAnd what are good options for\nmanaging your money?\n\n113\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so for customers, you want a CRM,\n\n114\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.090\nthat's a customer relationship\nmanagement system.\n\n115\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.230\nThere's Hub Spot, there's Salesforce,\nthere's a lot of different ones out there.\n\n116\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.262\nThere's xZro, X-Z-R-O,\nthere's several out there.\n\n117\n00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:06.890\n&gt;&gt; Salesforce?\n\n118\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.380\nSalesforce is super pricey.\n\n119\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.260\nIt's great, don't get me wrong, but the\nprice, especially for a small business,\n\n120\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.880\ncan be astronomical.\n\n121\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a good point,\nbut it depends.\n\n122\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.960\nLet me explain.\n\n123\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.910\nSalesforce has the best\nintegrations out there in terms of\n\n124\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.820\ncustomer relationship management systems.\n\n125\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.640\nIf your product or something you do with\na partner or some part of your business\n\n126\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.620\nrelies on those integrations,\nyou're gonna buy into Salesforce.\n\n127\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.390\nYeah, it's about 150\nbucks a month per person.\n\n128\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.110\nBut you know what?\n\n129\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.190\nIf you need those integrations,\n\n130\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.015\nan API integration with something,\nyou're gonna buy Salesforce.\n\n131\n00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:37.330\nIt's just that simple.\n\n132\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.830\nNow if you had to buy stuff,\nyou gotta track your money.\n\n133\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.430\nSo how are you gonna do it?\n\n134\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.160\nHow are you gonna take money\nif you're doing retail?\n\n135\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.260\nAnd how are you gonna track money\nif you're doing basic accounting,\n\n136\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.980\nwhich I hope you're doing as a business.\n\n137\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.610\nIt's just a detail thing.\n\n138\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.700\nSo if you wanna take money,\nyou're gonna wanna use either Square or\n\n139\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.941\nany of the phone-enabled readers.\n\n140\n00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:58.054\nIn other words, you plug it into your\nphone through the headphone jack or\n\n141\n00:06:58.054 --> 00:07:01.527\nthrough the bottom port, whether it's\nLightning or a Micro USB or a USB-C, and\n\n142\n00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:02.770\nyou can swipe a credit card.\n\n143\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.130\nThey even have EMV readers now.\n\n144\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.160\nSquare I know has them.\n\n145\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.380\nI believe First Data has them as well,\nwhere you can slide their chip readers.\n\n146\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.570\nSo where you can slide the card in and\nread the chip.\n\n147\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.310\nOkay, that's good for taking in money.\n\n148\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.050\nBut when you're out and\nyou have to go to business meetings.\n\n149\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.840\nAnd you have lunches and\nyou have to get Ubers, and this, that, and\n\n150\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.470\nthe other, how do you keep\ntrack of all those receipts?\n\n151\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.760\n&gt;&gt; So there's two ways that you do that.\n\n152\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.960\nOne is you can use an app that's\ndesigned for keeping track of receipts.\n\n153\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.440\nExpensify is something I've\nbeen pushing for years.\n\n154\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.020\nI think it's a great app.\n\n155\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.130\nConcur is another one, but\nthat's more enterprise based.\n\n156\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.640\nExpensify you can do on your own,\nand if you join a company,\n\n157\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.070\nthey can have a corporate\nExpensify account.\n\n158\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.160\nIt's really, really simple.\n\n159\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.900\nYou literally take a picture\nof the receipt and\n\n160\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.240\nboom, it's in your Expensify account.\n\n161\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600\nAnd you say it's billable,\nhere's the client it's billable to, and\n\n162\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.640\nit's reimbursable to me, Here's\nthe account I wanna get reimbursed from.\n\n163\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.860\nIt's simple, straightforward.\n\n164\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.380\n&gt;&gt; So as a good recap, for communication,\nuse Slack or WhatsApp, not Facebook.\n\n165\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.110\nFor project management, you want Evernote\nor Trello, right, or Producteev, right?\n\n166\n00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.020\nFor document management, it all depends\non what your business is doing,\n\n167\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.890\non how you wanna manage your documents,\n\n168\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.230\nbecause that's really what it comes\ndown to, what fits for your business.\n\n169\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.770\nFor security, make sure that you're\nalways using encryption, right?\n\n170\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.470\nFor CRM, you wanna look at HubSpot\nif you're a small business or\n\n171\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.690\nsomething that's along\nthe lines of HubSpot.\n\n172\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.860\nIt's not as pricey as Salesforce,\n\n173\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.740\nalthough you may find Salesforce\nfits your needs for your business.\n\n174\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.790\nAgain, it all comes back to how\ndo you run your business and\n\n175\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.150\nhow do you tailor your business, right?\n\n176\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.500\nFor money, it depends on whether\nyou're taking cash in over the web,\n\n177\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.480\nwhether you're taking it in over a card,\nright, and how you're managing\n\n178\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.020\nwhat's going on with your money,\nwhether you're using QuickBooks for\n\n179\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.070\nyour accounting, or you're using Expensify\nto track you receipts for your accountant.\n\n180\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.520\nEither way, these are couple of small tips\nabout low cost resources for business.\n\n181\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.360\nI'm Scott, this is Josh.\n\n182\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.789\nThanks for watching.\n\n183\n00:08:55.789 --> 00:09:01.814\n[MUSIC]\n\n184\n00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:08.709\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
