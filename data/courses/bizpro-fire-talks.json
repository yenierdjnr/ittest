Hi, thanks for joining us on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.976\nI'm Joshua Marpet, and\nthis is Scott Lyons, we're from Red Lion.\n\n6\n00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:22.380\nWe're gonna do a quick-fire talk on\nlow-cost resources for small business.\n\n7\n00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.522\nSo, Scott, start us off, what kind\nof resources are we talking about?\n\n8\n00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, in small businesses,\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.283\na lot of small businesses\nreally rely on communication.\n\n10\n00:00:30.283 --> 00:00:34.744\nThey rely on project management, a little\nbit of document management because, hey,\n\n11\n00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.280\nyou need a place to be\nable to put your stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what kind of resources\nwould you use for communication?\n\n13\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, personally my personal favorite,\nnot gonna lie,\n\n14\n00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.810\nI break the holy truth of communication\ndon'ts, and that's using Facebook.\n\n15\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.160\nRealistically, you shouldn't do that, but\nI am a huge, huge breaker of that rule,\n\n16\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.440\nonly because everybody that\nI know is there, so why not?\n\n17\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.033\nVersus having Slack, right?\n\n18\n00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.610\n&gt;&gt; That's true because, with Slack,\nyou have to be on a specific team.\n\n19\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.291\nWith Gtalk, you have to know which\naddress they have their Gtalk set up on.\n\n20\n00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.980\nWith Facebook, everybody's right there,\nthey're all in the same sort of grouping.\n\n21\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.130\nAnd if they're a friend of yours, you can\nimmediately message them and talk to them.\n\n22\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.136\nBut it's monitored, it's subpoenable,\nit's easily get at people.\n\n23\n00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:23.504\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n24\n00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:26.152\nSo we recommend anything but Facebook.\n\n25\n00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:30.352\nSignal, Slack, Gmail any of those things,\nplease use them instead of\n\n26\n00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:36.018\nFacebook Messenger, but if you have to, as\nScott apparently always does, it's there.\n\n27\n00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nyou also have to remember, though,\n\n28\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.440\nit comes down to the level\nof communication.\n\n29\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.490\nIf you're talking about\ncompany trade secrets,\n\n30\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.960\nyou sort of want an encrypted chat.\n\n31\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.919\nFacebook is not what you wanna use.\n\n32\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.520\nAin't that the truth?\n\n33\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n34\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.412\n&gt;&gt; But in being able to talk to\npeople about communication also\n\n35\n00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.372\ncomes project management.\n\n36\n00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:58.865\nSo for you,\nwhen we're going through projects,\n\n37\n00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:02.820\nwhat do you like to use\nto manage the projects?\n\n38\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.310\n&gt;&gt; So in actuality,\nthere's several things that I've used.\n\n39\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.160\nI've used Trello, I've used Producteev.\n\n40\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.890\nFor BSides Delaware, the conference that\nI run, we use Producteev and Trello.\n\n41\n00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.250\nFor my house,\nmy wife setup a Trello board, so\n\n42\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.025\nI would have a honey do\nlist that was perfect.\n\n43\n00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:19.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Everything from taking out the garbage\n\n44\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560\nto folding the laundry to fixing\nthe plumbing is on our Trello list for\n\n45\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.100\nthe house.\n\n46\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.770\nEvernote is a great one because it allows\nyou to put snippets of web pages and\n\n47\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.890\neverything else in there.\n\n48\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.740\nIt depends.\n\n49\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.330\nTrello is a Kanban board, or\nthink of Post-it notes on a white board.\n\n50\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.745\nProducteev is more project based like\nAsana where you have tasks that tricked\n\n51\n00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:43.415\ntogether or linked together to do the task\none, then task two, then task three.\n\n52\n00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.205\nSo it depends, but\nall of these are free versions.\n\n53\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:47.165\nSo it's very,\nvery low cost and very simple.\n\n54\n00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\na lot of the free versions follow the same\n\n55\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.040\ntheory of project management,\nwhether it's the hybrid model,\n\n56\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.080\nthe DevOps model, the Waterfall model,\nthey're all baked into these systems.\n\n57\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.770\nAnd that's really what's most important is\nthat they're flexible for your business.\n\n58\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, because,\nif you're an Agile firm.\n\n59\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.810\nIf you do Agile development, you're gonna\nwant to use a Kanban board like Trello or\n\n60\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.290\nyou're gonna want to use,\nif you're Waterfall,\n\n61\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.020\nyou're gonna want to use\na Waterfall-based system or\n\n62\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.520\nsomething that's Waterfall sort of\nbaked into its genes, like Producteev.\n\n63\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.790\nYou can do Agile on Producteev, but\nit's a little different to set up.\n\n64\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.300\nBut again, even to do these things,\n\n65\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.041\nyou've gotta figure out where\nyou're gonna save all your stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:25.308\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually a really good\npoint, because it brings us into the next\n\n67\n00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:28.490\npart of our discussion here which\nis document management, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.500\nNow me personally,\nI love using Google Docs.\n\n69\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.770\nGoogle Docs for everything.\n\n70\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.240\nIt makes things really simple.\n\n71\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.360\nThe cost benefit value is there,\nespecially for\n\n72\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.950\na small business that might not have\naccess to enterprise level resources.\n\n73\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, except that Google Docs\nis a nightmare to keep organized,\n\n74\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.180\nbecause if you create it or I created it,\nit's now in different folders.\n\n75\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.150\nAnd if we have folders of the same name,\nit's impossible to merge them together.\n\n76\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.700\nSo one friend of ours, Kevin Johnson from\nSecure Ideas, actually had a great idea.\n\n77\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.040\nHe created a single master folder in\nGoogle Docs and everybody in the firm puts\n\n78\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.110\nall of their things, all of their\ndocuments, in that master folder.\n\n79\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.540\nThat's worked, and we actually have\ndone that with some of our subcompanies.\n\n80\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.560\nAnd some of our subcompanies somebody\nstarted stuff that didn't do that and\n\n81\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.790\nI got a little annoyed with them.\n\n82\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.510\nI'm not saying it was\nanybody in particular,\n\n83\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.130\nI'm just pointing it out, let's say.\n\n84\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.250\nBut there's plenty of document management\nprojects and systems out there.\n\n85\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.693\nThere's Google Docs, there's GitHub,\nthere's Dropbox, there's Citrix.\n\n86\n00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.115\nI forget the shares.\n\n87\n00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:32.666\n&gt;&gt; AWS, you can use the S3 buckets\nin AWS to do storage as well.\n\n88\n00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:33.840\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's correct.\n\n89\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.300\nBut there's lots of them out there.\n\n90\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.080\nAWS actually charges for the S3 buckets,\nso that's technically not free but\n\n91\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.650\nit's relatively inexpensive.\n\n92\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.470\n&gt;&gt; And either way you look at it, you need\nto have security built-in to what you do,\n\n93\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.692\nso you're looking at Google\nauthenticator for your two factor,\n\n94\n00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:53.218\nyou're looking at let's encrypt,\nand https, all the things.\n\n95\n00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:57.390\n&gt;&gt; Well that's https everywhere which is\na project that was started I think by\n\n96\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.510\nGoogle, maybe even Facebook, but you'll\nnotice as you wander around the web these\n\n97\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.140\ndays most every major website is now https\nwith the green padlock on some browsers.\n\n98\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.804\nIf it's not SSL or TLS encrypted,\nto be honest with you,\n\n99\n00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:14.390\nis the correct way to say it, if it's not\nTLS encrypted, you shouldn't be using it.\n\n100\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.932\nIt means you're pushing information\nacross an unsecure connection,\n\n101\n00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:20.960\nthat's an insecure connection that\njust will not secure your information.\n\n102\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.160\nSo you've got to make sure that you're\ntwo-factor, multi-factor in some form or\n\n103\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.750\nfashion, you're getting another factor\nof authentication into your document\n\n104\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.290\nmanagement, into your sales management,\ninto all of the things that you do as\n\n105\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.590\na business, because otherwise\nyou're risking everything you have.\n\n106\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's say you\nwalk down all of these roads.\n\n107\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.168\nYou do all the basics, you've watched\nthe talks that we've put out.\n\n108\n00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:42.997\nAnd you say, hey, I have this\ngreat thing called customers, and\n\n109\n00:05:42.997 --> 00:05:44.840\nnow I have money coming in, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.320\nSo the last two topics that I wanna talk\nabout real quick are, what do we do for\n\n111\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.560\nour customers?\n\n112\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.710\nAnd what are good options for\nmanaging your money?\n\n113\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so for customers, you want a CRM,\n\n114\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.090\nthat's a customer relationship\nmanagement system.\n\n115\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.230\nThere's Hub Spot, there's Salesforce,\nthere's a lot of different ones out there.\n\n116\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.262\nThere's xZro, X-Z-R-O,\nthere's several out there.\n\n117\n00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:06.890\n&gt;&gt; Salesforce?\n\n118\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.380\nSalesforce is super pricey.\n\n119\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.260\nIt's great, don't get me wrong, but the\nprice, especially for a small business,\n\n120\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.880\ncan be astronomical.\n\n121\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a good point,\nbut it depends.\n\n122\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.960\nLet me explain.\n\n123\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.910\nSalesforce has the best\nintegrations out there in terms of\n\n124\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.820\ncustomer relationship management systems.\n\n125\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.640\nIf your product or something you do with\na partner or some part of your business\n\n126\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.620\nrelies on those integrations,\nyou're gonna buy into Salesforce.\n\n127\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.390\nYeah, it's about 150\nbucks a month per person.\n\n128\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.110\nBut you know what?\n\n129\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.190\nIf you need those integrations,\n\n130\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.015\nan API integration with something,\nyou're gonna buy Salesforce.\n\n131\n00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:37.330\nIt's just that simple.\n\n132\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.830\nNow if you had to buy stuff,\nyou gotta track your money.\n\n133\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.430\nSo how are you gonna do it?\n\n134\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.160\nHow are you gonna take money\nif you're doing retail?\n\n135\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.260\nAnd how are you gonna track money\nif you're doing basic accounting,\n\n136\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.980\nwhich I hope you're doing as a business.\n\n137\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.610\nIt's just a detail thing.\n\n138\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.700\nSo if you wanna take money,\nyou're gonna wanna use either Square or\n\n139\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.941\nany of the phone-enabled readers.\n\n140\n00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:58.054\nIn other words, you plug it into your\nphone through the headphone jack or\n\n141\n00:06:58.054 --> 00:07:01.527\nthrough the bottom port, whether it's\nLightning or a Micro USB or a USB-C, and\n\n142\n00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:02.770\nyou can swipe a credit card.\n\n143\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.130\nThey even have EMV readers now.\n\n144\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.160\nSquare I know has them.\n\n145\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.380\nI believe First Data has them as well,\nwhere you can slide their chip readers.\n\n146\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.570\nSo where you can slide the card in and\nread the chip.\n\n147\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.310\nOkay, that's good for taking in money.\n\n148\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.050\nBut when you're out and\nyou have to go to business meetings.\n\n149\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.840\nAnd you have lunches and\nyou have to get Ubers, and this, that, and\n\n150\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.470\nthe other, how do you keep\ntrack of all those receipts?\n\n151\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.760\n&gt;&gt; So there's two ways that you do that.\n\n152\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.960\nOne is you can use an app that's\ndesigned for keeping track of receipts.\n\n153\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.440\nExpensify is something I've\nbeen pushing for years.\n\n154\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.020\nI think it's a great app.\n\n155\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.130\nConcur is another one, but\nthat's more enterprise based.\n\n156\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.640\nExpensify you can do on your own,\nand if you join a company,\n\n157\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.070\nthey can have a corporate\nExpensify account.\n\n158\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.160\nIt's really, really simple.\n\n159\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.900\nYou literally take a picture\nof the receipt and\n\n160\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.240\nboom, it's in your Expensify account.\n\n161\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600\nAnd you say it's billable,\nhere's the client it's billable to, and\n\n162\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.640\nit's reimbursable to me, Here's\nthe account I wanna get reimbursed from.\n\n163\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.860\nIt's simple, straightforward.\n\n164\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.380\n&gt;&gt; So as a good recap, for communication,\nuse Slack or WhatsApp, not Facebook.\n\n165\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.110\nFor project management, you want Evernote\nor Trello, right, or Producteev, right?\n\n166\n00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.020\nFor document management, it all depends\non what your business is doing,\n\n167\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.890\non how you wanna manage your documents,\n\n168\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.230\nbecause that's really what it comes\ndown to, what fits for your business.\n\n169\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.770\nFor security, make sure that you're\nalways using encryption, right?\n\n170\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.470\nFor CRM, you wanna look at HubSpot\nif you're a small business or\n\n171\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.690\nsomething that's along\nthe lines of HubSpot.\n\n172\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.860\nIt's not as pricey as Salesforce,\n\n173\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.740\nalthough you may find Salesforce\nfits your needs for your business.\n\n174\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.790\nAgain, it all comes back to how\ndo you run your business and\n\n175\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.150\nhow do you tailor your business, right?\n\n176\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.500\nFor money, it depends on whether\nyou're taking cash in over the web,\n\n177\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.480\nwhether you're taking it in over a card,\nright, and how you're managing\n\n178\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.020\nwhat's going on with your money,\nwhether you're using QuickBooks for\n\n179\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.070\nyour accounting, or you're using Expensify\nto track you receipts for your accountant.\n\n180\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.520\nEither way, these are couple of small tips\nabout low cost resources for business.\n\n181\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.360\nI'm Scott, this is Josh.\n\n182\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.789\nThanks for watching.\n\n183\n00:08:55.789 --> 00:09:01.814\n[MUSIC]\n\n184\n00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:08.709\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

It's difficult.\n\n45\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.331\nIt's very difficult.\n\n46\n00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:23.725\nYou've got businesses that are not\nable to get off the ground.\n\n47\n00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:27.535\nBut everybody inside the business\nis obsessed with it saying,\n\n48\n00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:31.365\nwe're gonna be a billion dollar business,\nwe just have to make that first sale.\n\n49\n00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:35.672\nYou've got businesses that\nare high-flying and then all of a sudden,\n\n50\n00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:39.187\nthe CEO is revealed to be a harasser and\na general scumbag,\n\n51\n00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:42.442\nand then they're falling\nas fast as you can imagine.\n\n52\n00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.430\n&gt;&gt;

Not just stress, but\na lot of other things.\n\n75\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.540\nWhen you're an entrepreneur, especially an\nentrepreneurial CEO, you're stressed out.\n\n76\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.770\nIt's almost an occupational hazard,\nit's a fact of life.\n\n77\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.650\nYou're stressed beyond normal people.\n\n78\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.790\nI mean people have committed suicide,\npeople have died, people have had heart\n\n79\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.270\nattacks, people have developed heart\nproblems because of the stress.\n\n80\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.260\nYou're lonely because you may have\npeople that work for you, but\n\n81\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.300\nunless they've been a CEO, how are they\ngoing to know what you're going through?\n\n82\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.350\nIt is an entirely different feeling.\n\n83\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.970\nThey're worried about\nmaking their paycheck.\n\n84\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.463\nYou're worried about making their\npaycheck, your paycheck, the healthcare\n\n85\n00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:26.380\nthat you've gotta buy, the sales that\nyou've gotta make, the, you get the idea.\n\n86\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n87\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.090\nSo one of the things that we like to\npreach about when we're going through and\n\n88\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.880\ndoing these business talks is\nthat when you hire somebody,\n\n89\n00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.740\nit's not a key marker of success.\n\n90\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.330\nWhat it really is is the fact that you\nhave another mortgage that you're taking\n\n91\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.970\non, right?\n\n92\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.860\n&gt;&gt; You have a wonderful thing when you\nhave a business that grows enough for\n\n93\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.130\nyou to get some employees.\n\n94\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.360\nThat is fantastic,\nit's a great marker of success.\n\n95\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.470\nIt also means that you've\nnow taken on people who are,\n\n96\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.440\nthink of them as your kingdom.\n\n97\n00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.120\nYou've taken on people who\nare now responsible to you, but\n\n98\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.390\nyou're responsible to them to\nmake sure that there is business,\n\n99\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.850\nthere is opportunity, there is money,\nthere are paychecks going on.\n\n100\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.496\nLet's say you fail three months in,\nbecause that's a constant worry for a CEO,\n\n101\n00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:12.653\nIf you fail,\nyou've now broken your promise to them.\n\n102\n00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:16.150\nYou've now broken the promise that you\nwould be there and building the business.\n\n103\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.090\nHow is that gonna make you feel, and\nworrying about that kind of feeling\n\n104\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.030\nis absolutely terrifying to a CEO.\n\n105\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Now, at the time that we're recording\nthis talk that you're watching right now,\n\n106\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.950\nwe are actually streaming this\nover Facebook Live, right?\n\n107\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.724\nAnd we had somebody ping us on Facebook\nLive and made a great, great point.\n\n108\n00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:40.680\nDuncan says,\nshouldn't one immediately define what\n\n109\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.458\nsuccess means for\nboth of them before they launch business.\n\n110\n00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:49.050\nFor example, is it money, is it freedom\nand that's actually a really good point.\n\n111\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.707\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n112\n00:05:49.707 --> 00:05:50.800\nIt's a great point.\n\n113\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.676\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nso let's answer that.\n\n114\n00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:57.672\nSo if you're going to launch a business,\nyou have an idea of what success is.\n\n115\n00:05:57.672 --> 00:06:01.000\nDoes it mean that you ironed it\nout to an absolute certainty?\n\n116\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.080\nNo.\nDoes it mean that even once you've ironed\n\n117\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.150\nit out and once you've created that\nbusiness, that that won't change?\n\n118\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.940\nNo, it can still change.\n\n119\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.330\nYou might start a business because that\nproblem that you're starting the business\n\n120\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.850\naround pisses you off so much that you're\ngonna see that everybody has the solution,\n\n121\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.740\nso nobody ever has that problem again.\n\n122\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.720\nNow, of course, along the way,\n\n123\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.070\nyou wanna be able to support\nyourself while doing it.\n\n124\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.660\nAlong the way, you wanna be able to\ncreate some value for the world.\n\n125\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.740\nThat's kind of a common thing.\n\n126\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.690\nBut it doesn't mean that along\nthe way you don't realize,\n\n127\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.940\nwow I could make $50 million\nselling this solution.\n\n128\n00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.370\nI'm pretty comfortable with\nthat as a measure of success.\n\n129\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.690\nThat's not bad, you know.\n\n130\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.405\n&gt;&gt; But some people just want to have\na business that subsists, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:43.080\nIt just goes along, it generates money and\nit really doesn't scale up, scale down.\n\n132\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.280\nIt just floats.\n\n133\n00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Well that’s a lifestyle consultancy,\nthat’s the term for it.\n\n134\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.020\nIt’s a lifestyle consultancy.\n\n135\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.290\nIt allows me to live in a lifestyle\nto which I’ve become accustomed to.\n\n136\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.510\nAnd it allows me to live at my $100,000,\n$300,000, $500,000 a year and\n\n137\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.030\nit never really changes.\n\n138\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.640\nI'm not interested in taking employees on,\nI’m not interested in what building and\n\n139\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.880\nscaling and whatever.\n\n140\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.340\nAnd if that's your measure of success,\nthat is totally fine, don't get me wrong.\n\n141\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.570\n&gt;&gt; But don't you ever wanna\nspend time with your family?\n\n142\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.420\n&gt;&gt; Well it doesn't mean that somebody who\nhas a lifestyle consultancy can't spend\n\n143\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.130\ntime with their family.\n\n144\n00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.870\nThey totally can.\n\n145\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.140\nAgain, those are measures of success.\n\n146\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.140\nIf your measure of success is to make\n$100 million, inside of three years, and\n\n147\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.400\nyou've got a company that can do it,\ncongratulations that's fantastic\n\n148\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.260\nby the way, but you'll have to work a\nmillion hours a day, and I'm exaggerating\n\n149\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.780\nbear with me, to do so, then you're\nnot gonna spend time with your family,\n\n150\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.320\nyou're not gonna spend time by yourself,\n\n151\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.540\nyou're not gonna spend time taking care\nof your own health, your own sanity.\n\n152\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.909\nAnd at the end of that year or\nthree years, or whatever it is,\n\n153\n00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:42.353\nyou're probably gonna be a blubbering\nwreck, but you'll have the $100 million.\n\n154\n00:07:42.353 --> 00:07:43.584\nYeah.\n\n155\n00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:46.585\nBut you're a blubbering wreck,\nnot able to enjoy 100 million.\n\n156\n00:07:46.585 --> 00:07:50.160\n&gt;&gt; So to help you with this,\nI think a little bit if I may,\n\n157\n00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.970\nspend time with family,\nspend time with friends.\n\n158\n00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.356\nGo and enjoy life.\n\n159\n00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:59.045\nYour business is not the most\nimportant thing you do.\n\n160\n00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.665\nWhat it does is it pays your bills.\n\n161\n00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:03.419\n&gt;&gt; Well ok, yes and no.\n\n162\n00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:07.812\nIt pays your bills but it also allows you\nto have quality time with your family.\n\n163\n00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:09.209\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Money is not happiness.\n\n164\n00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:11.931\nMoney is not happiness.\n\n165\n00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.416\nBut it certainly allows you to buy some\nfun times to help create happy memories.\n\n166\n00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:16.244\n&gt;&gt; It helps, yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:16.244 --> 00:08:18.190\n&gt;&gt; You have a young daughter.\n\n168\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:18.860\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n169\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.420\n&gt;&gt; And you adore her.\n\n170\n00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n171\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.230\n&gt;&gt; She is really, really, really cute.\n\n172\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.660\nShe's adorable.\n\n173\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.790\nAnd spending time with her, I see your\nface light up when you get to do it\n\n174\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.060\nIt is one of the most\namazing times in your life.\n\n175\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.380\nYou just absolutely adore her and\nthe time you spend with your wife and\n\n176\n00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.500\nyour little one, you're happy.\n\n177\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.370\nThat is wonderful.\n\n178\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.830\n&gt;&gt; It's the same with you and your dog.\n\n179\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.628\nIt's actually kind of funny.\n\n180\n00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:43.402\n&gt;&gt; My dog is so cute.\n\n181\n00:08:43.402 --> 00:08:45.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm also including your\nwife in this mixture.\n\n182\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:53.427\nBut you know it's the little\nthings that really make it for us.\n\n183\n00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:57.112\nAs we're running Red Lion and\nwe're bringing it off the ground,\n\n184\n00:08:57.112 --> 00:09:01.534\nit's the little things, the little\nchances, the little nuggets of time that\n\n185\n00:09:01.534 --> 00:09:06.023\nwe get to spend with our loved ones, that\nwe get to go and hug a loved one, right,\n\n186\n00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:10.170\nare what we really,\nreally value as being precious and wealth.\n\n187\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.150\n&gt;&gt; And as entrepreneurs, if you don't\nvalue those things, you are in trouble.\n\n188\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.620\nYou will not, not,\nnot live a quality life.\n\n189\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.290\nIf you have loved ones, and if you don't I\napologize, I'm not trying to be rude, but\n\n190\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.790\nif you don't, you've got friends.\n\n191\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.552\nMake some friends.\n\n192\n00:09:25.552 --> 00:09:27.160\nGo have time with friends.\n\n193\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.870\nMake sure you have a life and take care\nof yourself along with your business.\n\n194\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.270\nThe better quality life you have,\nthe better quality business you'll have.\n\n195\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.080\nI guarantee it.\n\n196\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n197\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.030\nSo to wrap all of this up.\n\n198\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.920\nThere are many facets to\nthe entrepreneurial roller coaster, right?\n\n199\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.748\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n200\n00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:49.343\nit all depends on what you wanna\ndo with your life, with your job,\n\n201\n00:09:49.343 --> 00:09:53.930\nwith your business and\nhow you run things, right?\n\n202\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.500\n&gt;&gt; Look, it all matters.\n\n203\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.830\nHaving money is fantastic,\nhaving a good family and\n\n204\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.410\na good wonderful set\nloved ones is fantastic.\n\n205\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.582\nThese are all good things, okay?\n\n206\n00:10:02.582 --> 00:10:06.470\nIt's a balance, it's moderation.\n\n207\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.848\nYou know, if you spend a year and you sit\ndown with your wife, or your husband, or\n\n208\n00:10:09.848 --> 00:10:11.438\nyour spouse or your loved one and say,\n\n209\n00:10:11.438 --> 00:10:14.222\nthis next year I'm gonna be working\non the business exclusively,\n\n210\n00:10:14.222 --> 00:10:16.920\nlike there is nothing in my life but\nbusiness for a year.\n\n211\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.790\nThat's fine.\n\n212\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.750\nThat's a choice that you make between\nthe two of you, the three of you,\n\n213\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.480\nthe ten of you,\nwhatever it is I don't care.\n\n214\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.830\nBut what matters is, is that you\nmake these choices, you communicate,\n\n215\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.320\nyou spend time, you balance and\nmoderate your life, okay?\n\n216\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.452\nIf you don't do that,\n\n217\n00:10:32.452 --> 00:10:35.561\nyou will not be healthy enough\nto get your company to success.\n\n218\n00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:38.830\nIf you don't do that, you will not be\nhealthy enough to get a job if it fails.\n\n219\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.473\nAnd that always has to be\nin your head by the way.\n\n220\n00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:44.176\n&gt;&gt;

Hi, I'm Scott, I'm the CEO, although\ntitles are relative, CEO of Red Lion.\n\n10\n00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:34.240\nYou can reach me at slyons@redlion.io\nif you have any questions.\n\n11\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.300\nSo Josh, running a business is fun.\n\n12\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.136\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n13\n00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Its' horrifying you're saying?\n\n14\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.490\n&gt;&gt; It's a serious pain in the buns.\n\n15\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.350\nLets be honest.\n\n16\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.566\nThere's enough paperwork\nto kill a small horse.\n\n17\n00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.324\nThere's enough stress to kill a large\nhorse or an elephant at that point.\n\n18\n00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:52.838\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's occasionally fun when you win,\n\n19\n00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:56.559\nand it's a lot of grind, and a lot of\nslog to get to those winning points.\n\n20\n00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it all depends on\nhow you keep track of all of it,-\n\n21\n00:00:59.293 --> 00:00:59.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is true.\n\n22\n00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:04.722\n&gt;&gt; Because there's multiple reasons\nthat you need to keep track of things,\n\n23\n00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:10.247\nwhether it be for taxes, for paperwork,\nfor, I don't know, just SNGs, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.247 --> 00:01:10.884\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n25\n00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:15.156\nhow do we go about keeping track\nof expenses because we've got,\n\n26\n00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:20.548\njust coming down here for ITPro and doing\nwhat we're doing for you to watch this.\n\n27\n00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:24.977\nWe've got flight, hotel, car,\nwe've got gas, we've got food.\n\n28\n00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:25.507\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n29\n00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:27.024\n&gt;&gt; What other incidentals?\n\n30\n00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:28.301\nHow do we track them?\n\n31\n00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.370\nLet's dive.\n\n32\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so keeping track of your expenses\nuse to be a very, very simple process.\n\n33\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.900\nAt the end of a trip you had\na wallet full of crumpled receipts,\n\n34\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.116\nthat you would carefully extract from\nthat bear trap known as a wallet.\n\n35\n00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:45.027\nYou pull them out, stretch them out,\nrealize that the thermal printing faded\n\n36\n00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:49.351\nfour days ago, and you're having to guess\neverything that's on it, tape them down to\n\n37\n00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.376\na piece of paper, write everything out on\nanother piece of paper and total it up,\n\n38\n00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:57.228\nfill out a form on some antiquated excel\nspreadsheet that has macros that were\n\n39\n00:01:57.228 --> 00:02:01.493\ndesigned by cave men, and then, eventually\nyour HR or expense department would give\n\n40\n00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:05.284\nyou back a piece of paper that basically\nsaid we can't read these receipts,\n\n41\n00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:06.995\nwe're not giving you any money.\n\n42\n00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:10.208\n&gt;&gt; And so,\nyou're saying you have to manually OCR, or\n\n43\n00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:13.700\noptical character recognize,\nyour own receipts?\n\n44\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.015\n&gt;&gt; It was bad in the old days, let me\ntell you something, it was horrible.\n\n45\n00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:18.221\nI remember having,-\n&gt;&gt; Back in my day.\n\n46\n00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.431\n&gt;&gt; A binder,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.115\n&gt;&gt; A binder full of receipts for\n\n48\n00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:22.803\na one month trip that I took.\n\n49\n00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:24.860\nIt was pitiful.\n\n50\n00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.200\nNowadays there's so\nmany more easier ways to do it.\n\n51\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.356\nWe personally use Expensify.\n\n52\n00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:32.235\nExpensify is literally\nan app on your phone.\n\n53\n00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.643\nYou take a picture of\nthe receipt with the camera.\n\n54\n00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:36.995\nThe app actually takes the receipt and\n\n55\n00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:38.866\nsends it off to be OCR'd-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n56\n00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:39.990\n&gt;&gt; By a human,-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n57\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.602\n&gt;&gt; So it's not digital OCR,\nor mechanical OCR.\n\n58\n00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:46.530\nThey put in the amount, the name of\nthe restaurant or whatever the expense is.\n\n59\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.988\nThey even put in a category sometimes if\nit's blatantly easy for them to do so.\n\n60\n00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:53.320\nThen at the end of the day you say\nwell this was for this client.\n\n61\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.687\nIt's billable and reimbursable, or\nit's not reimbursable or whatever, and\n\n62\n00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:01.076\nit was this category of thing\nthat happened, food, travel,\n\n63\n00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:01.970\nhotel,-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n64\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.075\n&gt;&gt; Yadda-yadda, you get the idea, and it\ngenerates a PDF with a lovely spreadsheet\n\n65\n00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:09.528\nlooking expense report form and\npictures of all the receipts without\n\n66\n00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:13.770\nthe thermal printing problem, because\nbelieve me, that's still a problem.\n\n67\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:21.175\n&gt;&gt; Now Expensify also has data connectors,\nright, which will allow it to export and\n\n68\n00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:24.601\nimport data as needed from other-\n&gt;&gt; Applications.\n\n69\n00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:25.742\n&gt;&gt; Other applications.\n\n70\n00:03:25.742 --> 00:03:28.532\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Like if you need to throw out invoices\n\n71\n00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:32.945\non a regular basis, right,\nthere are application integrations for\n\n72\n00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.166\ninvoicing, that Expensify has.\n\n73\n00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:41.610\nAnother really good expense tracking\npiece of software is Concur.\n\n74\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.288\n&gt;&gt; Concur is more for larger corporations.\n\n75\n00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:47.667\nIt's designed to have more rules and\napprovals and things like that.\n\n76\n00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:52.012\nSo Scott may only be authorized\nup to $300 for a car or\n\n77\n00:03:52.012 --> 00:03:56.090\nhe can only stay at Hilton or\nthese kinds of things.\n\n78\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.690\nIt's much more workflow\noriented than Expensify.\n\n79\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.500\nExpensify works for one person,\nthere's a free version even.\n\n80\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.440\nSo obviously, it depends on what type\nof business you are as to which type of\n\n81\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.933\npackage you're going to pick up, but\n\n82\n00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:09.004\nthose are the two big ones\nthat I know about at least.\n\n83\n00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:11.833\n&gt;&gt; Right, but when you're looking for\n\n84\n00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.925\na good expense tracking system,-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:18.181\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there's a couple of things\nthat you really wanna look for\n\n86\n00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:20.560\nin the system as far as usability goes.\n\n87\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.772\nSo portability.\n\n88\n00:04:21.772 --> 00:04:22.272\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:24.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's always an issue.\n\n90\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.364\nThe usability of it, does it have\na great UI that is just intuitive?\n\n91\n00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:30.614\n&gt;&gt; Well a lot of them do, but\n\n92\n00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:34.440\nyou gotta remember that it also\ndepends on what you're doing with it.\n\n93\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.608\nRemember that I said that Concur\nhas a lot of workflow rules.\n\n94\n00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:42.109\nIf those workflow rules are setup properly\nthen your expenses should go in boom,\n\n95\n00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:43.307\nboom, boom, done.\n\n96\n00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:46.504\nIf you're trying to break the rules\nhowever, or you don't know the rules, or\n\n97\n00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:49.960\nthey're not clear to you, then it's gonna\nvery, very choppy sort of experience.\n\n98\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.760\nIt's very bad.\n\n99\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.333\nIt's gonna reject this, deny that, and\n\n100\n00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:56.871\nyou're stuck doing a lot of\nwork to try make things work.\n\n101\n00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:57.526\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo\n\n102\n00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:01.862\nthe other piece that you wanna\nlook at is sustainability.\n\n103\n00:05:01.862 --> 00:05:05.430\nYou wanna look at where\nthe architecture sends your data.\n\n104\n00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.442\nDoes it send it to the cloud or\ndoes it keep it locally on your device?\n\n105\n00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:13.666\n&gt;&gt; And that’s for a privacy reasons, as\nwell as, what happens if I lose my device,\n\n106\n00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.540\nI drop it in the river.\n\n107\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.855\nDo I lose all of the receipts, which\ncould be thousands, and thousands, and\n\n108\n00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:19.882\nthousands of dollars?\n\n109\n00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:23.534\nSo, if it’s a SaaS application,\nand there’s a cloud backup,\n\n110\n00:05:23.534 --> 00:05:25.712\nthen I've got all my receipts still.\n\n111\n00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:28.593\nI just get a new device,\nlogin to my account.\n\n112\n00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:32.600\nThere's my thousands of dollars\nI would have lost otherwise.\n\n113\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.335\nOn the other hand, if it's not on your\ndevice, is it encrypted in the cloud so\n\n114\n00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:39.727\nthat it can only be opened by me, or\nperhaps, the admin at my company,\n\n115\n00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:43.254\nif it's a corporate application,\nso that there's privacy involved?\n\n116\n00:05:43.254 --> 00:05:46.617\nI don't want everybody to know what\nrestaurants I stayed at, sorry,\n\n117\n00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:49.242\nwhat restaurants I ate at,\nor what hotels I stayed at.\n\n118\n00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:52.292\nThere can be security implications,\nespecially if you're a target for\n\n119\n00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:53.493\nphysical security issues.\n\n120\n00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:54.304\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n121\n00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:58.440\nsometimes you don't even wanna use\nany of the technology at all, okay.\n\n122\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.723\nYou sit back and\nyou say I'm sick of this, okay and\n\n123\n00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:08.600\nhey a bag, works perfectly for\nme or my accountant.\n\n124\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah look, accountants cost by\nthe hour, and if you wanna pay somebody to\n\n125\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.700\nspend hours and days cataloguing your\npaper receipts, well that's your choice.\n\n126\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.607\nBut if you're a smart CEO, or a smart CFO,\nyou're gonna say why did we spend $800 to\n\n127\n00:06:24.607 --> 00:06:28.660\ncatalog your $10,000 worth of receipts for\none trip?\n\n128\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.300\nWhy don't we just have you use Expensify\nor Concur, it's a heck of a lot cheaper?\n\n129\n00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.300\nUnless, of course, you're here at ITPro,\nand they have Shelly.\n\n130\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.168\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We actually talked to Don at\n\n131\n00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:45.511\nITPro, and he said, we used Expensify and\nwe had some issues with it.\n\n132\n00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:48.708\nShelly took it over, she was already\ndoing this, that, and other thing, and\n\n133\n00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.580\nit works just fine for us, and\nthat's great, that's their choice.\n\n134\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.677\nBut they already had Shelly so\nthis is a very minor addition to her job,\n\n135\n00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:56.936\nit's not a big deal.\n\n136\n00:06:56.936 --> 00:07:00.222\nIf, however, they started getting\ntraveling sales people going all over\n\n137\n00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:03.402\nthe world, or the country at least,\nthey would probably switch to one of\n\n138\n00:07:03.402 --> 00:07:07.590\nthe applications that actually do it for\nthem, because Shelly would be overwhelmed.\n\n139\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.600\nAgain, it goes back to cost and time.\n\n140\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.980\n&gt;&gt; But the most important thing that they\ndid to figure it out was that they asked\n\n141\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.090\nquestions.\n\n142\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.971\n&gt;&gt; They tried.\n\n143\n00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:19.802\nThey tried, and they asked questions, and\nif you have questions about expenses,\n\n144\n00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:21.389\ntracking, business paperwork,\n\n145\n00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.798\nall the things we've been doing these\nFireTalks on, well, give a yell.\n\n146\n00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:25.529\nIt's not a problem at all.\n\n147\n00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.313\nYou can get to us through ITPro and\nBusinessPro.TV.\n\n148\n00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:31.366\nYou can call us directly\nat our Twitter handles.\n\n149\n00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:38.574\nYou've got @quadling at Twitter and\njmarpet@redline.io and for Scott.\n\n150\n00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:43.122\n&gt;&gt; Scott Lyons @CSP3R,\nC-S-P-3-R, or at slyons-\n\n151\n00:07:43.122 --> 00:07:45.630\n&gt;&gt; @redlion.io.\n\n152\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.740\n&gt;&gt; @redlion.io.\n\n153\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.072\nSo for Scott and Josh, thanks for\n\n154\n00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:55.835\nwatching our FireTalk about keeping track\nof your expenses, and have a good day.\n\n155\n00:07:55.835 --> 00:08:01.957\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
