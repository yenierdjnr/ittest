          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.948\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.744\nCapitalism has been at the center\nof economic prosperity and\n\n3\n00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.940\nfreedom for centuries.\n\n4\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.470\nBut when you hear names like Bernie Madoff\nor hear about the shenanigans of companies\n\n5\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.000\nlike Enron, well,\ncapitalism can become a dirty word.\n\n6\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.200\nHello, I'm Eric Wright\nalong with Jeff Piersall.\n\n7\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.480\nAnd we're here today with TREP talks\nto talk about some of the questions\n\n8\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.620\nentrepreneurs are asking.\n\n9\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.250\nAnd the question we're delving into\ntoday is, capitalism isn't a dirty word.\n\n10\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.100\nJeff, have greed and\ncapitalism become, well,\n\n11\n00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.120\nsynonymous?\n&gt;&gt; It's a great question, Eric,\n\n12\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.020\nand what has really happened\nover the course of time is that\n\n13\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.870\ncapitalism has created so\nmuch temptation for people.\n\n14\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.140\nAnd when left unchecked, that temptation\nwill lend itself to greed and\n\n15\n00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.980\nthose opportunities of selfishness when\n\n16\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.570\nactually capitalism is supposed to\nbe designed for that one thing and\n\n17\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.670\nthat one opportunity to really drive\nthe opportunity of freedom for all people.\n\n18\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.550\nAnd it's what made our country great, but\ntoday, it is very confused by itself in\n\n19\n00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.480\nits own definition.\n&gt;&gt; Jeff, it's almost like if we're not\n\n20\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.330\ngoverned by some sort of internal compass,\nwe're going to be forced to\n\n21\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.000\nbe governed by something on\nthe outside that nobody really wants.\n\n22\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.380\nSo we coin this term ethical capitalism.\n\n23\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.920\nWhy don't you unpack that for us, Jeff?\n\n24\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.940\nAnd how does it sort of address\nthis problem that we're discussing?\n\n25\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Eric, ethical capitalism,\n\n26\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.120\nby definition, creates a method, in a way,\nin which capitalism can prosper.\n\n27\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.270\nEthical meaning, let's just do\nthe right thing at the right time, and\n\n28\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.880\nat the right place.\n\n29\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.880\nAnd capitalism being the difference\nbetween the private sector driving profit,\n\n30\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.950\nor the public sector driving profit,\nin reality,\n\n31\n00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.240\nyou don't want the public\nsector driving private.\n\n32\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.020\nWe already know what the end\nconclusion to that is.\n\n33\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n34\n00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.910\nyes, gross inefficiency in most cases.\n\n35\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.590\nNow and\n\n36\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.280\nessential to this whole principle of\nethical capitalism is the idea of freedom.\n\n37\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.700\nAnd so let's talk about freedom and let's\ntalk about the elements of freedom that\n\n38\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.480\nimpact each and every one of us.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n39\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.920\nwhen you think about ethical capitalism,\nyou gotta go back and\n\n40\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.280\nget to the root fundamental of what\nreally drives all human beings.\n\n41\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.970\nAnd it really doesn't matter if\nwe're talking about terrorists, or\n\n42\n00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.290\nwe're talking about business owners,-\n&gt;&gt; Everybody.\n\n43\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.850\n&gt;&gt; Or we're talking a single mom at home.\n\n44\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.260\nIt's everybody.\n\n45\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.540\nWe're wired for freedom from birth of\nall cultures, all genders, all sexes.\n\n46\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.870\nAnd there's four components\nthat really drive that which is\n\n47\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.410\nfreedom of time, freedom of money,\nfreedom of relationships,\n\n48\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.010\nand freedom of purpose.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n49\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.060\nJeff, I know that these things didn't come\nout of something that you read in a book.\n\n50\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.130\nThis idea of freedom came out of your own\npersonal experience as an entrepreneur.\n\n51\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.520\nAnd so, maybe share a little\nbit of that journey with us,\n\n52\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.510\nhow this idea of freedom captured you and\n\n53\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.560\nbegan to drive you as an entrepreneur.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Eric, it really starts back in\n\n54\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.690\na summer around July 7th or\n8th for me, when I was working for\n\n55\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.420\na gentleman, making more money than\nI had ever made in my history.\n\n56\n00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.400\nAnd this was about 15 years ago.\n\n57\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.650\nAnd my daughter was between her junior and\nsenior year, was in a head-on crash, and\n\n58\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.630\nshe was airlifted to the hospital,\nwas there all night and\n\n59\n00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.020\ngreat thing, there was no alcohol or\nanything like that involved.\n\n60\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.470\nIt was just the other driver fell asleep.\n\n61\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.800\nAnd we get to the hospital,\nwe finally get through the surgeries.\n\n62\n00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.370\nI get on the phone with my\nboss the next morning and\n\n63\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.500\nit's about 7 AM and\nI go through this whole scenario.\n\n64\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.340\nAnd he ends the conversation with okay,\nJeff, great, I guess I'll see you in\n\n65\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.917\nan hour at the office.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to be kidding me.\n\n66\n00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:17.224\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And everything in me turned upside\n\n67\n00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:18.510\ndown.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n68\n00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.200\nAnd it was at that point it\nbecame the passion to drive for\n\n69\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.190\nthat time freedom and for\nthose relationship freedoms.\n\n70\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.380\nAnd later it became the financial freedoms\nwhich we'll talk about in other courses.\n\n71\n00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.290\nAnd then of course the purpose\nfreedom which I think, so for\n\n72\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.940\nme personally it was all about\nthe time and the relationship and\n\n73\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.470\nit was driven by an event which can happen\nto any of us where it creates the trigger.\n\n74\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.060\nIt took me eight to nine\nmonths to break out of\n\n75\n00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:54.135\nconfines of that relationship.\n&gt;&gt; But boy,\n\n76\n00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:58.241\nit's led to the last 14 years of great\ntime freedom and relationship freedom.\n\n77\n00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:01.305\n&gt;&gt; Wow, the main principles of ethical\n\n78\n00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:05.965\ncapitalism are discussed in our book,\nDogs Don't Bark at Parked Cars.\n\n79\n00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:07.975\nAnd as I was listening to you Jeff,\n\n80\n00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:12.910\nI was thinking about two really key\nelements that you have discussed\n\n81\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.010\nwith me many times that are essential\nto this concept to freedom.\n\n82\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.680\nWhy don't you break those down for a sec?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can have all the drive and\n\n83\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.630\npurpose that you want and you could\nhave all the desire for time, money,\n\n84\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.190\nrelationships, and purpose,\nbut at the end of the day,\n\n85\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.060\nif you don't have faith and\nthe courage to actually pursue it,\n\n86\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.355\nyou're gonna end up missing it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n87\n00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:40.990\n&gt;&gt; I always talk about the guy who sits\n\n88\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.190\non the couch and he's got all the desire,\n\n89\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.220\nhe's got all the reasons, he's got all\nthe knowledge, but at the end of the day,\n\n90\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.340\nhe doesn't have the courage\nto get off the couch and go.\n\n91\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.572\nAnd then you just gotta\nhave the faith in yourself.\n\n92\n00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:56.630\nYou gotta have the faith and\nthe belief that your courage and\n\n93\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.230\nthose things that are important to\nyou are worth it and you deserve it.\n\n94\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.730\nToo many people spend to much time in\na process of actually battling against\n\n95\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.590\nthemselves, than ever giving themselves\nthe chance by just having the faith for\n\n96\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.780\nthe future.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, that's so good, Jeff.\n\n97\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.940\nNow, what can the viewers that\nare watching here today do to help\n\n98\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.515\nincorporate these principles of freedom\nand ethical capitalism into their life?\n\n99\n00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:28.680\nNow one of them, Jeff and I wrote a book\ncalled, Dogs Don't Park at Parked Cars.\n\n100\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.760\nIt's available at Amazon,\nyou can pick it up at your bookstore.\n\n101\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.550\nAnd we worked through in detail\nsome of these principles.\n\n102\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.670\nBut Jeff, help our viewers have some\ntakeaways on how they can incorporate\n\n103\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.730\nethical capitalism,\nparticularly freedom into their own life.\n\n104\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think very most importantly is\n\n105\n00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:49.783\nto understand, this sounds so easy,\nit's just do the right thing and\n\n106\n00:06:49.783 --> 00:06:54.175\nlet's drive this through\nthe private sector with profit.\n\n107\n00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:59.653\nBut when you get down to the real final,\nnut and grind of this whole thing Eric,\n\n108\n00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:04.882\nthese decisions become very difficult and\nthe decisions you're making,\n\n109\n00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:10.446\nsomebody's always typically going to come\nout on the shorter end of the stick.\n\n110\n00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:15.230\nAnd so, people will look at you and go,\nyou're unethical because that hurt me.\n\n111\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.491\nWell actually, what it did is it probably\nfreed you up to go do what you're supposed\n\n112\n00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:21.300\nto be doing.\n&gt;&gt; Forced you to do what you need to do.\n\n113\n00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.520\n&gt;&gt; And that really starts\n\n114\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.890\nthe conversation, which is the first\nthing that everybody needs to do is\n\n115\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.770\ndefine what freedom is for them in time,\n\n116\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.130\nmoney, relationship, and purpose.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n117\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Because if you don't write that\n\n118\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.410\ndown and define it, then you've got no\nidea and you're kinda just being pushed\n\n119\n00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.910\nby the wind, and you've really gotta\nhave a real clear track of that.\n\n120\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.960\nAnd then you've gotta decide,\n\n121\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.940\nwhat price are you willing to\npay to go achieve that freedom?\n\n122\n00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.670\nAnd there's a lot of people that\nreally say they want something but\n\n123\n00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.430\nthey're not willing to put the effort and\n\n124\n00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.890\nthe desire toward achieving it.\n&gt;&gt; Jeff,\n\n125\n00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:07.220\nwe have a statement that we often\nuse that unethical is unsustainable.\n\n126\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.170\nThat if you operate in an unethical way,\neventually that is going to catch up\n\n127\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.670\nto you, eventually it's gonna torpedo\neverything you're trying to do and\n\n128\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.770\neverything you're trying to get.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n129\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.900\nwe've got tons of examples.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n130\n00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.110\nwe could spend the rest of\nthe day unpacking all of those.\n\n131\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.630\nBut by incorporating these\nsolutions into your life,\n\n132\n00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.260\nyou're going to begin to gain freedom.\n\n133\n00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.990\nAnd hopefully you're going to arrive at\na place where you're driving your business\n\n134\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.770\ninstead of your business driving you which\nis really the essence of freedom for\n\n135\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.660\nan entrepreneur.\n\n136\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.290\nAnd again, we'll talk about that more is\nsome of our future FREP talk, TREP talks.\n\n137\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.410\nSo take the time, stop, don't wait,\n\n138\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.900\nwrite down what freedom means to you in\nthese four terms that Jeff mentioned.\n\n139\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.960\nDo it now.\n\n140\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.450\nAlso, you can go to our website,\nTrepBiz.com.\n\n141\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.860\nThere you can get videos like this,\nyou can get articles that Jeff and\n\n142\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.430\nI have written so that you have help and\n\n143\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.170\nassistance on your\nentrepreneurial journey.\n\n144\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.870\nI wanna again thank you for\njoining us for TrepTalks.\n\n145\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.110\nFor myself Eric Wright and\nmy partner here Jeff Pearsol,\n\n146\n00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.444\nwe look forward to continuing this\ndiscussion and further conversations.\n\n147\n00:09:18.444 --> 00:09:22.890\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
