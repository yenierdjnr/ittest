ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.650\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrey, joining me\ntoday is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.930\nHow's it going today Mr. Wes?.\n\n5\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.490\n>> It's going great, it's good to be here.\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.800\nGood to be back with the ITProTV crew\nhere and, we got a really fun show today.\n\n7\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.280\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout building computers.\n\n8\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.480\nAnd one of the things that we're gonna do\nin this episode is we're gonna try to set\n\n9\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.750\nthe stage for well what do you\nneed to put together, a list.\n\n10\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.510\nWe're gonna develop our shopping list and\nget our components ready to go.\n\n11\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.770\nAnd we're gonna set a budget,\nwe're gonna find out.\n\n12\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.390\nHow close we can get to that budget.\n\n13\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.570\nIf we have a couple thousand dollars,\nwe have $5,000 out, well guess what?\n\n14\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.990\nI don't really think we have a problem\n>> [LAUGHS]\n\n15\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.650\n>> on what we want to build.\n\n16\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.470\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n17\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.450\nNot everybody just has money to\njust keep throwing out there.\n\n18\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.675\nAt least,\nI don't know about you Dan I know I don't.\n\n19\n00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:04.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm poor.\n\n20\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.140\n>> Right, so, hopefully one of the things\nthat we can do today is help you guys\n\n21\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.270\nwhen you come away from this show knowing\na little bit of the method to the madness.\n\n22\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.060\nDeveloping a list, setting a budget, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.960\nseeing how close we can get to that budget\nwhen it comes to building a computer.\n\n24\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.460\n>> That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.798\nWe're gonna kinda operate under\nthe assumption that we're a couple of\n\n26\n00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:26.411\ncomputer techs, or\nmaybe you're a self employed guy,\n\n27\n00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:29.208\nyou're trying to get into the field and\ndo stuff like that.\n\n28\n00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:33.772\nBuilding custom PCs for people is\ntypically a job that newbies get into and\n\n29\n00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:37.905\nit's a great one, because it allows\nyou to work with components.\n\n30\n00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.269\nYou start understanding what's out there,\nwhat's available for\n\n31\n00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:45.570\nthe customer market and working with\nequipment, giving you some real hands on.\n\n32\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.580\nSo, that's one of the reasons\nwe wanted to do this show.\n\n33\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.490\nNow, as Wes said there's some\npre-planning that's gonna go along.\n\n34\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.100\nWe are gonna set a budget for ourselves,\nit's not gonna be gargantuan.\n\n35\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.002\nWin, but\nit's not going to be a pittance either.\n\n36\n00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.870\nWe're gonna make sure that\nit's mid to the road,\n\n37\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.910\nmake sure there's a little bit\nof money in the kitty, for\n\n38\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.560\nus to pick out some components,\nand try to meet that mark.\n\n39\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.841\nNow Wes, obviously we've got our budget.\n\n40\n00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:09.919\nWhere did we set our budget at?\n\n41\n00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.169\n>> We set our budget\nat around 700 to $800.\n\n42\n00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.465\nAt first Dan and I were talking, we're\nlike, we're going to go for $700, and\n\n43\n00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.325\nthen I was thinking.\n\n44\n00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:19.710\nWell, we might need a little cushion.\n\n45\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.441\nBecause if I'm spending money, you always\nhave in your minds eye what you're\n\n46\n00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.462\ngonna go for, but\nsometimes it doesn't happen.\n\n47\n00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:31.770\nSo we're gonna say 700 to $800 range\nhere and we're gonna look at some of\n\n48\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.168\nthe components that we have to put into\nthat case, and some of the requirements.\n\n49\n00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:41.175\nNow if you're the average end-user you\nknow you might save some money if you're\n\n50\n00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:46.048\njust gonna buy it outright from an OEM,\nor original equipment manufacturer.\n\n51\n00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:50.410\nBut one of the great things about building\nyour own and having it customized for you,\n\n52\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.130\nis you can tailor make it\na little more to your needs.\n\n53\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.600\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n54\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.908\n>> Awesome, so I guess, where do we begin?\n\n55\n00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:57.758\nWe've got our budget.\n\n56\n00:02:57.758 --> 00:02:58.860\n>> That's right.\n\n57\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.696\n>> We know we don't need\nthe top of the line,\n\n58\n00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:03.017\nwe know we don't want\nthe bargain basement either.\n\n59\n00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.600\nWe need that mid range, so\nnow, where do we start?\n\n60\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.218\nWhat's the first component\nwe should tackle?\n\n61\n00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:07.921\n>> That's right.\n\n62\n00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:11.740\nWell, you need a place to store all the\ncomponents that are gonna be in the system\n\n63\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.116\nunit, right, the system unit.\n\n64\n00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:16.341\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly, so with the system unit,\n\n65\n00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.740\nit holds everything together, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.530\nOur system unit,\none of the major components\n\n67\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.080\nthat are part of the system unit is\nsomething known as a case or a tower.\n\n68\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.070\nYou might hear many different terms,\nchassis, case, tower.\n\n69\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.440\nSo, don't let any of\nthose terms confuse you.\n\n70\n00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.470\nJust remember that some places might\ncall it a little bit different,\n\n71\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.979\nprimarily what we talk about is the tower.\n\n72\n00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.738\nNow, when it comes to\nthe tower there are some very,\n\n73\n00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:43.318\nvery important things\nthat you got to consider.\n\n74\n00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:47.020\nOne of the first things we got to\nconsider is something called form factor.\n\n75\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.720\nNow form factor for us typically\ndescribes the size of the case and\n\n76\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.000\nmore importantly what kind of\nmotherboard we can put in the case.\n\n77\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.780\nSo that’s one of the first things\nthat you want to start out with.\n\n78\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.660\nNow when it comes to the form factor,\n\n79\n00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.340\nyou can also have what is known as\nthe mid-range or the full tower.\n\n80\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.718\nNow the full tower,\nyou've got to be careful.\n\n81\n00:04:08.718 --> 00:04:10.553\nIt might be the size of\na small refrigerator.\n\n82\n00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:14.470\nSo if you're storing your components,\nhow big is your desk?\n\n83\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.160\nYou really have to consider:\ndo I have a lot of space?\n\n84\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.740\nIf I have a lot of space, well then, I\ncould probably go with a full size tower.\n\n85\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.230\nMaybe space is a little bit limited,\n\n86\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.070\nand if it is you can reduce that\ndown to even a midsize tower.\n\n87\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.010\nMaybe you don't have any space at all and\n\n88\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.230\nthen you're going to go even smaller form\nfactor of what's known as a slimline case.\n\n89\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.952\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nhit middle of the road here.\n\n90\n00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:41.950\nWe're gonna say we're not going to go for\nthe refrigerator size computer and\n\n91\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.780\nat the same time we're not gonna go for\nthe matchbox size computer.\n\n92\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.640\nI think one of the best mid range form\nfactors is gonna be something known\n\n93\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.550\nas your midsize ATXK.\n\n94\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.080\nSo it's one that's very important for us.\n\n95\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.250\nNow when you're considering buying a case\n\n96\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.570\nthere are some characteristics\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n97\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.580\nFor instance how many hard\ndrives can you store in this.\n\n98\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.306\nNow again we're not gonna go with a gaming\ncase where we have to have a gazillion\n\n99\n00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:10.955\ndrives, and that'd be awesome.\n\n100\n00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:14.090\nBut you also gotta think\nabout things like expansion.\n\n101\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.698\nSo if I start out with a case that\nonly has maybe two hard drive bays,\n\n102\n00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:21.510\nwell I'm kinda limited as to what I\ncan do potentially in the future.\n\n103\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.530\nSo we have to make sure that we get\na case that has enough drive bays for it.\n\n104\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.300\nWe need to make sure that what kinda\n\n105\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.770\noptical drives we might need\nto put into this machine.\n\n106\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.989\nAre we gonna have one that's DVD,\nmaybe one that's Blu-ray.\n\n107\n00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:36.361\nAre we gonna have a combo?\n\n108\n00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.629\nBecause that's the difference between\nhaving enough of the five and a half inch\n\n109\n00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.180\nbays that optical drives typically\nstay in, versus not having enough.\n\n110\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.710\nSo some good considerations there.\n\n111\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.330\nOne of the things you also have to\nconsider too, if you're gonna buy a case.\n\n112\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.140\nDo I need any front panel connectors,\nin the positioning of those connectors?\n\n113\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.220\nSome people, they put their case right\nnext to them where their work station is,\n\n114\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.270\nand they like top mounted IO ports.\n\n115\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.840\nMaybe to be able to plug in a headset\nto the top of the case rather than\n\n116\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.630\nhaving to fumble down and\nplug it down into the bottom of the case.\n\n117\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.280\nSo that might really be something\nyou have to consider as well.\n\n118\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.400\nSometimes you can even get them\nwith ESATA ports on the top.\n\n119\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.450\nIf I've got an extra laptop drive\nthat I'm not using anymore,\n\n120\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.740\nI can just plug it right in.\n\n121\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.010\nAnd I can use it as an external drive.\n\n122\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.020\nI would say probably one thing that you\nalso have to consider is power supplies.\n\n123\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.470\nIs the power supply gonna\nbe part of the case or not.\n\n124\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.960\nSo, one of the things that we're going\nto do here is, let's go ahead and\n\n125\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.470\nmaybe take a look at some cases,\nmaybe do some comparison here.\n\n126\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.095\nSo, we've gone and kinda done some\nof the research ahead of time.\n\n127\n00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:51.175\nTo try to help just ease the burden of all\nof the research you have to do for this.\n\n128\n00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:53.355\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:56.955\nI've got our computer case\npulled up here on the screen.\n\n130\n00:06:56.955 --> 00:07:01.420\nNow, one of the things that you\nwant to do, do your research.\n\n131\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.190\nYou can go to many different places here.\n\n132\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.980\nI've got one pulled up, again kind\nof doing that research beforehand.\n\n133\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.210\nI've also got one here.\n\n134\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.030\nTiger direct too.\n\n135\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.660\nSo you do have a couple of options, but\none of the first things you want to do\n\n136\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.772\nis you want to look at\nthe specifications of the case.\n\n137\n00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:19.110\n>> Good idea.\nWhen it comes to cases like we've been\n\n138\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.440\nkinda hinting toward.\n\n139\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.340\nYou need enough room inside\nto put all your components if\n\n140\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.270\nyou're gonna have some massive gaming\nrig that's super awesome, gigantic,\n\n141\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.500\ncrazy video cards that you can buy and\nI've seen them there.\n\n142\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.840\nThey have their own fans and\nheatsinks and everything.\n\n143\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.120\nYou're going to need room for that, right?\n\n144\n00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.686\nSo buying the correct case for what your\napplication is, is kind of important.\n\n145\n00:07:39.686 --> 00:07:43.172\nNow Wes you talked a little bit at the\nbeginning when we were jumping into this\n\n146\n00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:43.946\ncase business.\n\n147\n00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:45.485\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> About form factors.\n\n148\n00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.115\nDifferent types of motherboards as well.\n\n149\n00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:48.215\n>> Yep.\n>> Also has to make sure\n\n150\n00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:49.595\nit fits the right motherboard, right?\n\n151\n00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:50.565\n>> That's, that's right too.\n\n152\n00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:54.084\nSo, for instance, the case that I have\nright here, the one that I've picked out.\n\n153\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:56.793\nAnd I've got a couple, so\nI'm not just picking on one vendor.\n\n154\n00:07:56.793 --> 00:07:58.126\nYou might have a vendor\nout there you like.\n\n155\n00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:59.169\nThis is New Egg, great vendor.\n\n156\n00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.876\nWe got another one here.\n\n157\n00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.626\nFor TigerDirect.\n\n158\n00:08:02.626 --> 00:08:07.716\nNow notice they've got some of\nthe same specifications and\n\n159\n00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:15.090\nthe specification I want you to look at\nhere is Standard ATX, microATX, Mini-ITX.\n\n160\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.250\nIf I switch on over to the other\none that we've looked at,\n\n161\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.030\nwell, they've only got one ATX,\nbut what does that mean for us?\n\n162\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.060\nWell, the ATX form factor has\ndiffered throughout the years.\n\n163\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.520\nSo you have to be very very mindful of\nwhat motherboard form factor you're gonna\n\n164\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.330\nget, because three of the form factors\nthat have to match in any computer build.\n\n165\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.470\nWe've already mentioned one.\n\n166\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.360\nThe case is very important cuz\neverything has to fit inside the case.\n\n167\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.320\nBut then the second factor that's\ncoming up here is the motherboard.\n\n168\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.290\nThe case and the motherboard have to\nmatch, because if you get one of these\n\n169\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.720\ngiant motherboards and you try to put\nit into this little top set like box,\n\n170\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.730\nwell, obviously,\nyou're not gonna break out the hammer and\n\n171\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.800\ntry to break that thing in there and\ndo any customizations.\n\n172\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.000\nSo, I have to make sure that\nif I've got a ATX case,\n\n173\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.640\nin this case you can see some\nof the specifications behind it.\n\n174\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.400\nDoes it have what I need?\n\n175\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.290\nWell, it's got three, oh,\nfive and a quarter inch base.\n\n176\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.180\nIt looks like this one has, what is it?\n\n177\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.510\nThree and a half inch base,\nwhich are internal drives.\n\n178\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.810\nAnd this one even\nsupports solid state too.\n\n179\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.120\nSo you can see those 2.5 inch drive bays.\n\n180\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.560\nNow, I have to get a motherboard\nthat matches the same thing.\n\n181\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.545\nI've gone ahead and\n\n182\n00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:28.640\nI've picked a motherboard that you can\nsee has the Micro ATX form factor.\n\n183\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.270\nNow here's the thing\nthat I have to consider,\n\n184\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.580\nis the Micro ATX gonna fit in this case?\n\n185\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.860\nWell if we went with this case,\n\n186\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.560\nwe might run into a problem cuz\nremember it only says ATX here.\n\n187\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.690\nSo if I scroll down and I wanna find out,\ndoes this motherboard have\n\n188\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.740\nthe compatibility with my case or\nvice versa, however you wanna say that.\n\n189\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.020\nOne of the first things I have to\ndo is I have to look right here and\n\n190\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.330\nyou can see this says MICRO ATX.\n\n191\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.400\nAnd ATX here.\n\n192\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.240\nSo looks like this motherboard is going\nto support our case, or vice versa.\n\n193\n00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.960\nOur case is going to\nsupport our motherboard.\n\n194\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.550\nNow, when it comes to your motherboard,\nthe form factor is absolutely critical.\n\n195\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.720\nNow, in relationship to your case, a lot\nof times when you see these multiple form\n\n196\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.750\nfactor names in the list, it's because\nthey have different mounting points.\n\n197\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.549\nSo you don't have to worry about, it's\nnot certainly a one size fits all, but\n\n198\n00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:26.620\nyou can fit different form\nfactors inside there.\n\n199\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.923\nThe other thing I think about when I think\nabout a motherboard is going to be how\n\n200\n00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:33.320\nmany hard drive connections does it have?\n\n201\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.460\nDoes it have video support?\n\n202\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.910\nDoes it have sound support?\n\n203\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.828\nBut I can tell you one of the first things\nthat we really need to know here is this\n\n204\n00:10:42.828 --> 00:10:47.460\nwhole concept of what family,\nwhat product line are we going to go with?\n\n205\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.640\nAnd for us today there's really\ntwo major product lines.\n\n206\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.640\nAnd that product line is either going\nto be Intel or it's going to be AMD.\n\n207\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.080\nNow, when it comes to that,\nthat's going to be your choice.\n\n208\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.510\nSome people like Intel and\nare going to stick with Intel.\n\n209\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.510\nSome people like AMD and\nthey're gonna stick with AMD.\n\n210\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.760\nAnd that is one of the most crucial\nthings, I would say if you're gonna start\n\n211\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.610\nwith a motherboard, you have to know\nwell what product line am I gonna get,\n\n212\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.610\nbecause in some of the other components\nthat we talk about they have to match.\n\n213\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.860\nYou can't mix and match.\n\n214\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.690\nSo knowing whether you're going to go with\nAMD or you're going to go with Intel,\n\n215\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.680\nis going to be one of the first\nthings that you want to discuss.\n\n216\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.913\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then don't forget,\n\n217\n00:11:27.913 --> 00:11:29.490\nyou got to cool the stinking things.\n\n218\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.920\nWhether you're an AMD fan or\nyou're an Intel fan, great.\n\n219\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.905\nWave that flag as hard as you like.\n\n220\n00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.497\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you want to make sure that a case\n\n221\n00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:39.070\nstays cool, because if you don't\nit's going to burn the thing up and\n\n222\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.725\nit's going to be a useless hunk of brick.\n\n223\n00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:42.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's not what we want.\n\n224\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.010\nSo cooling is also an important\nfactor when it comes into\n\n225\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.090\nwhich motherboard you actually choose.\n\n226\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.560\nAnd also the case that you bought.\n\n227\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.020\nHow are we gonna get,\nis it gonna be a large cooling device?\n\n228\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.860\nIs it gonna be a small?\n\n229\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.790\nAnd Wes, actually there's\nquite a few different types of\n\n230\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.230\ncooling systems that you can run into.\n\n231\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.760\n>> There is.\n\n232\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.280\nThere is.\n\n233\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.635\nNow, again depending on what you're\ngonna do with the overall build,\n\n234\n00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:06.890\nit's really gonna dictate which one of\nthese cooling options you're gonna have.\n\n235\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.120\nSee when you buy your case,\nsometimes not all the time, but\n\n236\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.670\nsometimes you might have some\nfans included in the case.\n\n237\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.440\nOne of the things that usually happens\nis when you buy a CPU it typically\n\n238\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.630\ncomes with a heat sic, just a metal\nblock that sits on top of the CPU.\n\n239\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.710\nAnd for the most part if you're\nnot applying more voltage,\n\n240\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.760\nyou're not trying to get extra performance\nand pump more electrical current into that\n\n241\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.850\nCPU than what it's generally rated at,\nyou should be good with a stock cooling.\n\n242\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.650\nNow, if you want to go a little\nbit farther than this,\n\n243\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.940\nif you want to go overboard on it,\na little bit more advanced of a set up,\n\n244\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.530\nyou could go with something\nlike liquid cooling.\n\n245\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.720\nNow, with a liquid cooling, it is fun,\nbut I will tell you something,\n\n246\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.060\nI have always had a problem with\nshould I take an electrical component,\n\n247\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.470\nand run a liquid across that?\n\n248\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.080\n>> Yeah, it's definitely something\nthat would probably cross the mind\n\n249\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.820\nof an average person of\nmoderate intelligence.\n\n250\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.470\nWe understand that electricity and\nwater, not the best of friends,\n\n251\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.570\nwhen it comes to things we want to buy and\nkeep running.\n\n252\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.830\nIf you get the two mixed together, well\nyou're gonna have yourself another brick.\n\n253\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.440\nAnd maybe even a fire, oh that'll be fun.\n\n254\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.040\nNo it won't be fun.\n\n255\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.520\nBut liquid cooling it's come a long way,\n\n256\n00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.082\nit's not like you're just hosing in some\nfish tank pipes in there, all right Wes.\n\n257\n00:13:22.082 --> 00:13:23.050\n>> Hopefully.\n[LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.340\n>> They kind of look like radiators\n\n259\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.040\nto be honest with you.\n\n260\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.770\n>> They really do.\n\n261\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.470\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n262\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.590\nlet's take the time to look at\nsome of these cooling options.\n\n263\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.500\nBecause, you have a lot of options out\nthere and which one you go with is\n\n264\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.330\nreally gonna be based on your knowledge,\nyour skill level as a tech.\n\n265\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.957\nBecause some of the liquid\ncooling systems,\n\n266\n00:13:38.957 --> 00:13:42.920\nthey can be, they can come in\na lot of parts if you will.\n\n267\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.340\nIf you don't know those individual parts,\nit could be a little difficult.\n\n268\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.320\nSo here we've got many different options.\n\n269\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.580\nYou can see some air coolers here,\nsome water and liquid coolers.\n\n270\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:58.910\nIf you are an entry-level technician,\nmaybe you wanna try using liquid cool.\n\n271\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.140\nCorsair makes some good ones here\nthat are all self contained systems.\n\n272\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.380\nSo you don't have to put the liquid in.\n\n273\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.100\nYou don't have to screw down\nthe water blocks, any of the water\n\n274\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.820\nblocks that are across the chip set,\nand it's relatively easy.\n\n275\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.450\nIt's a good entry level type\nof liquid cooling system.\n\n276\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.970\nNow you can go, certainly,\n\n277\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.640\nas extravagant as you want based\non whatever your price point is.\n\n278\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.670\nLet's see here, there's another one.\n\n279\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.750\nThat one looks like it's\nan all internal system.\n\n280\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.710\nThere we go, so there's another one here.\n\n281\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.800\nAnd again you can look at\nthe specifications there.\n\n282\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.640\nAnd there we go.\n\n283\n00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.140\n>> Looks like what's in my car.\n\n284\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.990\n>> Yes that's exactly it,\nwell Dan made a good point,\n\n285\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.540\nit's like these look a lot\nlike radiators right.\n\n286\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.280\nWell, that's exactly what they're doing,\n\n287\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.170\nthey're taking this whatever\nthe liquid is inside of them and\n\n288\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.160\nit's trying to dissipate that heat\noff of whatever it's cooling.\n\n289\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.940\nCuz it could cool the CPU,\ncould cool the memory, and\n\n290\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.420\nthen pass it through a radiator, and\nthat process just keeps continuing here.\n\n291\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.970\nSo again,\ndepending on the complexity of the build,\n\n292\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.190\nit's really gonna tell you which one of\nthese cooling solutions you're gonna use.\n\n293\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.580\nAll in ones are very good if\nyou are just starting out,\n\n294\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.660\nhowever if you wanna get a bit\nfarther than that, you can.\n\n295\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.150\nYou also have the option too to when it\ncomes to cooling, is buying cases fans.\n\n296\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.420\nNow when you buy a case fan,\nyou have certain common sizes,\n\n297\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.340\nyou have what are known as 80 millimeter,\nthe 20 millimeter and\n\n298\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.140\neven some of the 250 millimeter fans too.\n\n299\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.600\nYou can see some other shapes here\nas well, like 140 millimeter.\n\n300\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.369\nNow, one of the things you want to keep\nin mind when you're talking about buying\n\n301\n00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:35.069\na cooling system,\nsee if it's a liquid cooling system,\n\n302\n00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:37.650\nwe don't really have to worry about noise.\n\n303\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.730\nNo noise at all.\n\n304\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.530\nAll right.\n\n305\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.750\nBut if you're buying your fans,\n\n306\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.020\nyou definitely have to worry\nabout how loud they are,\n\n307\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.200\nespecially if you start the case up and\nit sounds like a helicopter taking off.\n\n308\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.100\nSo, pay attention to which\nfans your case takes.\n\n309\n00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.830\nYour CPU typically comes with a fan.\n\n310\n00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.870\nAnd if you're not doing\nthings like over-clocking,\n\n311\n00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.850\nmost often the stock cooling\nsystem will be just fine.\n\n312\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.770\n>> So then we've got to motherboards,\nright?\n\n313\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.958\nThat's where we're at.\n\n314\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.668\nWe've got a processor for it,\nwe've got a cooling system for that.\n\n315\n00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:05.950\nWe gotta take that into account.\n\n316\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.808\nAlso wanna take into account,\n\n317\n00:16:07.808 --> 00:16:12.459\nsometimes Motherboards will come with\non board things like video and sound.\n\n318\n00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:16.820\nAnd that might be a good way to go,\nit can do some advantageous things for us.\n\n319\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.960\nWe can also make sure that we get it\nlarge enough, with enough expansion slots\n\n320\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.350\nto add in those video or\nsound if that's the way we're gonna go.\n\n321\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.115\nBut again, it's all gonna come back to\nthat, oh, what does the customer need.\n\n322\n00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:30.140\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> Versus what we have available.\n\n323\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.190\n>> And what the price point is.\n\n324\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:31.900\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly.\n\n325\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.410\nSo, for instance, if your customer\nplans on trying to keep this for\n\n326\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.065\na couple of years of not being\noutdated like the proverbial computer\n\n327\n00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:44.235\nusually is outdated in six months,\nand then you might\n\n328\n00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:47.765\nwant to make sure that you have also\nroom for additional expansion too.\n\n329\n00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:51.700\nAnd that'll all be in the specifications\nof the motherboard itself, again,\n\n330\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.344\nif you're maybe trying to price cut\na little bit here you can go with the on\n\n331\n00:16:55.344 --> 00:16:56.000\nboard video.\n\n332\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.410\nBut if you're gonna do any kind of video\nrendering that might not be feasible,\n\n333\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.610\nso you might have to add\nthat extra video capability.\n\n334\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.220\nThe same thing goes with your sound.\n\n335\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.680\nOne of the other things\nto keep in mind though,\n\n336\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.060\nI want to get back to though\nis those adapter slots.\n\n337\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.640\nDepending on how much expansion you wanna\ndo in the future, pay attention to that,\n\n338\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.210\ncuz that could be a deal breaker.\n\n339\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.210\nI know when I was buying my\ngigabyte board at the house,\n\n340\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.000\nI had looked at another board and\nit only had two PCIE slot.\n\n341\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.255\nWell, I needed three, I can't\nremember exactly what I was doing but\n\n342\n00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:28.785\nI needed three.\n\n343\n00:17:28.785 --> 00:17:33.265\nThree is better than one or two, so, for\nthat board it was the perfect price.\n\n344\n00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:36.445\nEverything was set up exactly\nthe way I wanted, except for\n\n345\n00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:39.355\nthat there, so that was the deal\nbreaker on the motherboard,\n\n346\n00:17:39.355 --> 00:17:42.150\nso make sure that you have room for\nexpansion.\n\n347\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.920\n>> Yeah, I tend to be under\nthe philosophy of, I'd rather have it and\n\n348\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.760\nnot need it than need it and\nnot have it if I can get away with that.\n\n349\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.500\nAnd so,\n\n350\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.650\nyou gotta take into account maybe one day,\nI will want that extra expansion slot.\n\n351\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:58.200\nSo, if you have the money and you can go\nfor a board that has more expansion slots,\n\n352\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.380\nthat might be a good idea,\njust forward thinking.\n\n353\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.780\nNow, that brings us to,\nwe've got motherboard now, right?\n\n354\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.220\nWe understand, we've got the CPU,\ngotta cool it, we have expansion slots.\n\n355\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.840\nMaybe we'll go with some on board sound or\nvideo.\n\n356\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.500\nBut another one of the big components that\nwe're gonna have to really focus in on\n\n357\n00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.840\nis the hard drive.\n\n358\n00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.620\nHow much storage space am I\ngoing to need for this thing?\n\n359\n00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.620\nHow fast do I need that guy to run?\n\n360\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.520\nWhat kind of reliability am I\ngonna go with a RAID array?\n\n361\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.780\nAll sorts of things come into\nmind when it comes to storages.\n\n362\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.580\nInternal, external.\n\n363\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.270\nThis can be very bogging down,\n\n364\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.690\nit can get you spinning your wheels going,\nokay do I want this one?\n\n365\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.660\nOr do I wanna go with that one?\n\n366\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.000\nAgain, a lot of times it's gonna come\ndown to price, what can you afford?\n\n367\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.205\nI always say get the the best product that\nyou can afford that sticks to your budget.\n\n368\n00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:51.679\nDon't go over that, cuz next thing you\nknow, you're nickel and dimming yourself.\n\n369\n00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:54.887\nYou set your budget at $700,\nand now it's $1700.\n\n370\n00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:55.745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You think, well,\n\n371\n00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:59.000\nI only added, you know,\nthese small components.\n\n372\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.340\nThey add up, so be mindful of that,\nespecially if it’s a customer’s build, but\n\n373\n00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.950\nthe hard drive is a place where\nif they want good performance,\n\n374\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.300\nthis is where you might want\nto spend some more money.\n\n375\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.040\n>> Yeah, and\nthat’s a good thing to consider, too,\n\n376\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.940\nis whether you’re going to do\nthe traditional mechanical drive.\n\n377\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.220\nNow, traditional mechanical\ndrives that we talk about,\n\n378\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.470\nthey can usually scale up to\nlarge storage capacities.\n\n379\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.910\nAnd you don't get charged an arm and\na leg for them,\n\n380\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.830\nbut it might reduce a little\nbit of the performance.\n\n381\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.940\nThe other thing to keep in mind is,\nwhat interface?\n\n382\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.040\nAnd it's usually serial ATA\nin the PC environment today,\n\n383\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.980\nbut, how many of those interfaces?\n\n384\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.668\nSo, how many drives does\nthe mother board support?\n\n385\n00:19:37.668 --> 00:19:39.290\nSo, you're gonna notice\na commonality here,\n\n386\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.800\nwhere we keep going back to\nthat mother board, right?\n\n387\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.910\nWell, I need to make sure that if I, yeah.\n\n388\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:50.300\nIt's nice to have four drive base,\neight drive based on your case there.\n\n389\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.250\nBut if the motherboard only has\ntwo drive interfaces cases,\n\n390\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.940\nthen you're pretty much limited.\n\n391\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.170\nThe other consideration might\nbe solid state storage.\n\n392\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.340\nIt's not uncommon today to say hey, I'm\ngonna get a smaller solid state storage\n\n393\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.050\ndevice, and\nmaybe put my operating system on that.\n\n394\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.490\nAnd then turn around and get like one of\nthe traditional mechanical drives for\n\n395\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.200\nthe data that I'm gonna store,\ncuz of the fact that dollar for\n\n396\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.490\ndollar if you're just storing data, you're\ngonna get more of a benefit out of those\n\n397\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.710\ntraditional heart mechanical drives than\nyou will the solid state storage device.\n\n398\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.690\nYou also have to pay\nattention to vendor as well.\n\n399\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.060\nSo one of the things that we do, and you\nknow, quantity is another big thing too.\n\n400\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.030\nIf you are gonna use storage erase,\n\n401\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.140\nif you're gonna use a RAID array like\nthat, now we're getting into a situation.\n\n402\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.450\nDoes the motherboard support RAID?\n\n403\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.030\nAll right.\n\n404\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.060\nOr does, do you have to get\nan additional adapter card?\n\n405\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.850\nIf you have to get an additional adapter\ncard to support the RAID functionality,\n\n406\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.300\nkinda like Dan said, maybe that put us\na couple $100 over what our budget was.\n\n407\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.560\nSo there again, that's something that\nif you're gonna do multiple drives,\n\n408\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.780\njust take a look at the specifications\nof the motherboard and\n\n409\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.120\nsee if it has that\nintegrated functionality.\n\n410\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.910\nIf it doesn't, there again,\nthat might not be the motherboard for you,\n\n411\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.750\nif you truly do need that functionality.\n\n412\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.330\nAverage end user a lot of\ntimes doesn't need this,\n\n413\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.570\nbut again, It's gonna be based\non the customer's needs.\n\n414\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.190\n>> Yeah, Wes,\n\n415\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.020\nit really brings up a really good question\nthat I was sitting here thinking of.\n\n416\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.800\nCapacity, right?\n\n417\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.935\nWe're all like, give me all\nthe space I can get my hands on,\n\n418\n00:21:17.935 --> 00:21:20.340\ncuz Lord knows I'm going to fill it up.\n\n419\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.260\nBut with SSDs, I don't usually\nget as much capacity unless I'm\n\n420\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.660\nwilling to pay gargantuan\namounts of money.\n\n421\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.490\nSo, the question comes in, do I go with\nthe mechanical drive where I don't get\n\n422\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.560\nthe performance that I would with\nthe SSD but I do get the capacity or\n\n423\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.210\nis it worth more the money to go for\nthe performance of the SSD.\n\n424\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.360\nA nice quick speed, everything's\ncoming at me that way I like it.\n\n425\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.610\nWhat's the better of the two?\n\n426\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.700\n>> Well, there again,\nhow much money do you have to spend?\n\n427\n00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.005\nWhat is you're price point?\n\n428\n00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:56.190\nCuz you can even get into trouble when it\ncomes to selecting a solid state drive.\n\n429\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.440\nOne of the things that might be beneficial\nto the end user is to get one of these\n\n430\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.700\nsmaller solid state drives that per gig,\ndollar for dollar, they are fairly cheap.\n\n431\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.930\nToday they are, it certainly wasn't\nthe case a couple years back.\n\n432\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.260\nYou could spend hundreds of\ndollars on even a small SSD,\n\n433\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.340\nso as the solid state drives get\na little bit better if you need\n\n434\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.780\nmaybe performance on some kind of\napplication, if you're running,\n\n435\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.480\ni don't know, the Adobe,\nlike Photoshop or something like that.\n\n436\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.630\nYou need some really good performance,\n\n437\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.930\nthen maybe a smaller solid state drive is\ngonna be good for you, but if you can't\n\n438\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.920\njustify the cost to get the performance,\nthen you can always back up and\n\n439\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.190\nsay you know what I'll just go with what\nwe've been using for a very long time.\n\n440\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.060\nAnd I can get two terabytes for\n\n441\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.820\nhalf of the price of what I got\nsomething that might only be 100 gigs.\n\n442\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.330\n>> Yeah I would say on a budget build.\n\n443\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.380\nProbably the best way to go is a really\nfast mechanical drive cuz you're gonna\n\n444\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.380\nget lots of storage, that's gonna\nnot cost you as much as solid state.\n\n445\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.800\nBut if you still want to go solid\nstate cuz you just, like he said,\n\n446\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.240\nmaybe you're running Photoshop,\nmaybe you're doing audio work or\n\n447\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.150\nvideo rendering, those types of things.\n\n448\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.870\nThis application can really hit\nperformance when it comes to\n\n449\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.620\nthe drive itself.\n\n450\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.030\nSo, go with a small SSD for\nthings like the applications and\n\n451\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.090\nthe operating system and then spend\nthe rest of your money as much storage\n\n452\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.140\nwith a mechanical drives as you can.\n\n453\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.980\nProbably, the best of both worlds, right.\n\n454\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.720\n>> Yeah,\nI've got an older Intel X 25 M and\n\n455\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.990\nit's just a little 80\ngig solid state drive.\n\n456\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.900\nAnd I put my operating system on that.\n\n457\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.450\nI ended up going out and\ngetting a second 80 gig solid state drive,\n\n458\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.210\nyou're saying 80 gigs, man.\n\n459\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.970\nGosh, I got thumb drives that\nare bigger than that today.\n\n460\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.420\nWhat are you using it for?\n\n461\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.440\nI don't put any data on it,\nother than what applications need.\n\n462\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.540\nSo, for instance,\nI use virtualization technology,\n\n463\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.870\nso I put all of my virtual machines\non that second stylus state drive.\n\n464\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:43.100\nBut when it comes to the data like my,\nI don't know videos,\n\n465\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.450\nmy music, that data,\nI don't really access too much.\n\n466\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.420\nAnd it can stand on,\nit can sit on those traditional drives.\n\n467\n00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.050\nAnd the one good thing about\nthe traditional drives is if you're just\n\n468\n00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.610\nstoring your data, you can scale\nup to a very large capacity for\n\n469\n00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.180\na relatively cheap amount today.\n\n470\n00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.750\nYou're drives, like, Western Digital\nCaviar Black editions which is\n\n471\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:07.120\na higher end PC hard drive,\nthey go for 70 bucks.\n\n472\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.730\nSo very easily,\nyou could go up to two to four terabytes.\n\n473\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.690\nIt doesn't cost quite as\nmuch as the solid state.\n\n474\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.410\nBut again,\nif you need the performance solid states,\n\n475\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.580\nit is going to be where it's at.\n\n476\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.500\n>> All right.\nSo what are we going\n\n477\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.900\nto put inside of our computer\nthat we're building today?\n\n478\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.500\n>> We're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna put a, let's see here.\n\n479\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.760\nWe've got a case here,\nthis is the series 200 R Corsair.\n\n480\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:37.180\nI think what we're gonna see here,\nis this LGA Intel gigabyte board.\n\n481\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:43.700\nWe kind of went mid range on the processor\nhere cuz everybody wants the i7.\n\n482\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:50.370\nBut we said, not quite the i7,\nwe're gonna go with the i5 here.\n\n483\n00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.030\nAll right, here's the one that I think\nis going to be best for our build.\n\n484\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.070\nIt's a drive that I've actually used.\n\n485\n00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.729\nAnd this one here is the western\ndigital black series, so you're gonna\n\n486\n00:24:59.729 --> 00:25:04.340\nget moderate amount of performance out of\nthis, it's got the larger cache in it and\n\n487\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.890\nyou know the price isn't too bad either,\nit's only about $70.\n\n488\n00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.270\nSo, you know dollar for dollar,\none terabyte drive here,\n\n489\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.630\n7200 RPM's on the newest interface for\n$70.\n\n490\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.210\nYou really can't beat that, especially\nif you're again, building for a budget.\n\n491\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:19.780\n>> Awesome.\n\n492\n00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.350\n>> Yep.\n\n493\n00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.740\n>> All right, Wes, well, really good\nlooking drive you got there and\n\n494\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.720\nthat's gonna be great for\nour build what we're trying to do.\n\n495\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.100\nAnd you know what, we've got a whole\nlot more that we gotta talk about.\n\n496\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.230\nThere's actually a few more components\nwe wanna stick in this turkey but\n\n497\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.110\nwe've run out of time for this episode.\n\n498\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.020\nSo we're gonna have to make a part two.\n\n499\n00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.770\nWes, I know I'm looking forward to it.\n\n500\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.710\nI can't wait to see what the end price is.\n\n501\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.100\nDid we meet our budget or not?\n\n502\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.870\n>> We're hoping [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.560\n>> Yeah, we are hoping at that.\n\n504\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.500\nHopefully, we'll see you\nguys in part two on that.\n\n505\n00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.400\nBut as for this,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n506\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.370\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Danielle Lawrie.\n\n507\n00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.300\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n508\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:59.520\n>> And we'll see you next time\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.007\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, joining\nme yet again today is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:22.029\nHow are you doing today, Wes?\n\n5\n00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.530\n>> Oh, I'm doing great and it's great\nto be here with the ITProTV crew again.\n\n6\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.060\nAnd we're going on into our\ncomputer components and what we\n\n7\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.750\nreally need to put inside of a machine\nif we are building a PC for a customer.\n\n8\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.900\nIf you wanna know a little bit\nmore about the case, form factors,\n\n9\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.240\nwe talk about the motherboard and\nthe CPU, check out the first part of this\n\n10\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.450\nepisode here and\nwe can definitely review that information.\n\n11\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.960\nWhat we're gonna move on to today\nis something known as memory.\n\n12\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.000\nAnd apparently I seem to have a short-term\nmemory because we didn't put that\n\n13\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.560\none in the first portion\nof this series here.\n\n14\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.790\nSo we're gonna talk about it today.\n\n15\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.080\nAnd the memory is very, very important.\n\n16\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.010\nIt's one of the most important\ncomponents inside of the computer.\n\n17\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.470\nAnd the more you have, the better it is,\n\n18\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.588\nthe more applications you can\nhave working at one time.\n\n19\n00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:21.630\nNow, it's gonna be important that when\nyou need to decide what type of memory\n\n20\n00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.230\nyou need in the case, or attached to\nthe motherboard, we have to go back and\n\n21\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.220\nwe have to look at\nthe motherboard specification.\n\n22\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.380\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n23\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.550\nThe motherboard that we\nwere looking at here,\n\n24\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.120\nif you look at the specifications,\nyou will see, scrolling down here and\n\n25\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.980\nhitting specifications,\nit tells us a whole slew of numbers.\n\n26\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.100\nWell, [LAUGH] what are these numbers for\nus?\n\n27\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.303\nWell, these are the different memory\nstandards that this board supports.\n\n28\n00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:50.159\nSo you can really,\nyou've got a lot of options here.\n\n29\n00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.545\nNow, depending on how much\nmoney you wanna spend,\n\n30\n00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:57.020\nwe can definitely get\nvery pricey in your RAM.\n\n31\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.050\nOne of the things that you can\nalways keep in mind, depending on\n\n32\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.720\nhow much memory the motherboard supports,\nyou can always upgrade later.\n\n33\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.610\nSo, if you just need to start out with a\nbase build because you're in budget, well,\n\n34\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.410\nthat's perfect.\n\n35\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.120\nSo, for instance, you'll see right here,\nwe've got some G.SKILL memory,\n\n36\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.383\nits standard here is DDR3 2666.\n\n37\n00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:20.147\nAnd again, remember to match\nit up to the motherboard.\n\n38\n00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:22.420\nWhen we talk about things like pins and\nstuff,\n\n39\n00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.300\nthe specifications are what\nare really important.\n\n40\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.150\nAnd you can see we've got 8 gigs here, and\n\n41\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.922\nwe install this memory and maybe down the\nroad, the customer says, you know what?\n\n42\n00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:33.760\nI'm gonna do a lot more\nwith this computer.\n\n43\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.413\nSo maybe later, we can max it out, because\nthe board here does support 32 gigs.\n\n44\n00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:43.256\nBut just because the board supports that\nmuch doesn't necessarily mean that you\n\n45\n00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:45.471\nhave to max the RAM out to begin with.\n\n46\n00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:48.710\nBut it's definitely something that\nwe want to have in our systems.\n\n47\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.854\nIf we don't have it in our systems, you\ncan have the CPU, you can have the cache,\n\n48\n00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:55.380\nyou can have the motherboard, but the\nproblem is, the computer's not gonna run.\n\n49\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.110\n>> Yeah, so Wes,\nit sounds like what you're saying is,\n\n50\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.420\nsome of the best place we can spend\nour money is right here in RAM.\n\n51\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.200\nI know that a lot of times, if people come\nto me and they say my computer is slow,\n\n52\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.300\nand you're looking at it and\nit's really not slow for any bad reason.\n\n53\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.900\nIt's just, it probably needs\nan upgrade in the RAM department.\n\n54\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.930\nSo, if you're building a custom PC, and\nyou've got some budget money left over,\n\n55\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.370\nmaybe you didn't reach that cap and\nthere's still a little left in the kitty.\n\n56\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.500\nWell, it might be a good\nidea to go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.915\nthrow that money at more RAM,\nif at all possible.\n\n58\n00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.405\nMore RAM is gonna equal\nbetter performance.\n\n59\n00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:32.028\nAnd that's gonna equal a satisfied\ncustomer going, man this thing smokes,\n\n60\n00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:33.823\nI love the performance on this thing.\n\n61\n00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:35.100\nWes, would you agree with that?\n\n62\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.163\n>> Oh, absolutely,\nit's where the bang for the buck is.\n\n63\n00:03:39.163 --> 00:03:43.135\nYou're probably aware of the fact,\nand if you're not,\n\n64\n00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:48.280\nthe more RAM you have, the more\napplications we can have open at one time.\n\n65\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.110\nAnd ultimately, that's probably where one\nof the performance either, benefits or\n\n66\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.550\nhindrances are gonna be that the\ncustomer's gonna notice almost right away.\n\n67\n00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.224\nSo it's gonna be very, very important\nto have that RAM present and\n\n68\n00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:02.140\nhave enough of it.\n\n69\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.260\n>> Yes, definitely,\nwise words from Mr. Bryan.\n\n70\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.515\nNow, we're talking about RAM,\nthat's the R-A-M.\n\n71\n00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:12.244\nThere's also R-O-M, and it's probably not\nsomething we see as much anymore, but\n\n72\n00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:16.722\nit could still be a part of your PC build,\ndepending on what your customer needs.\n\n73\n00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:20.029\nAnd that's CD-ROMs,\nDVD-ROMs, even Blu-ray.\n\n74\n00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.290\nYou might need an optical drive inside of\nthe case for, maybe multimedia purposes.\n\n75\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.340\nNow Wes, we have obviously a variety of\ndifferent devices of which to choose from.\n\n76\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.660\nWhat would be the most\nprobably ubiquitous,\n\n77\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.740\nthe one that we see the most of?\n\n78\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.290\n>> I would say probably the DVD drive,\nbecause the DVD drives,\n\n79\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.750\na lot of times today, what you'll see\nis they're backwards compatible with\n\n80\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.650\nearlier formats and\nmost of them support multiple formats.\n\n81\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.220\nNow, Blu-ray, if you need that included,\nthat'll definitely jack the price up\n\n82\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.230\na little bit cuz it's another standard and\nagain, it could increase the cost.\n\n83\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.170\nBut keep in mind too,\nthat you have the expandability in a case.\n\n84\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.020\nIf you really do your research in\nthe case, a lot of times these cases\n\n85\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.970\nwill come with optical drive bays out\nof the five and a quarter inch bays.\n\n86\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.545\nSo maybe, I think I wanna expand later.\n\n87\n00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:09.315\nWell, I don't have to get the Blu-ray disc\nplayer or optical drive at this point,\n\n88\n00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:13.615\nI can get just the standard,\ntraditional DVD rewrite drive.\n\n89\n00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:15.715\nAnd again, a lot of times,\nthey are their combo drives,\n\n90\n00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:16.849\nthey support multiple formats.\n\n91\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.215\nNow, we actually have one of those here,\nand\n\n92\n00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.430\nyou can see that the price\nis relatively cheap.\n\n93\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.770\nThey can be a little bit more\nexpensive here, but here on Newegg,\n\n94\n00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.300\nwe've got about 35 bucks,\nwe could put an optical drive.\n\n95\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.930\nAnd, as much as we say maybe we\ndon't need optical disks anymore,\n\n96\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.400\nthere's still been times where I've\nwanted to install an operating system.\n\n97\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.410\nAnd well, unfortunately,\nI didn't have a USB drive around.\n\n98\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.230\nSo never think that optical drives\nhave gone by the wayside yet,\n\n99\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.340\nso it's definitely something\nthat you wanna keep.\n\n100\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.700\nAnd even for the average home user,\n\n101\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.105\na lot of times they're gonna\nlike their little cup holder.\n\n102\n00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:54.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's why we use the DVD\n\n103\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.360\ndrives, right?\n\n104\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.927\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> We built the case and here,\n\n105\n00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:58.508\nyou've got a cup holder, use it.\n\n106\n00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:00.632\n>> We put that right there,\na nice little coffee cup for you.\n\n107\n00:06:00.632 --> 00:06:05.900\nNow, the idea of practicality does come up\na lot when you talk about optical drives.\n\n108\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.591\nA lot of today's computers do not come\nwith optical drives at all because, well,\n\n109\n00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:12.062\nthere's a lot of different\ntypes of digital formats.\n\n110\n00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:16.139\nOnline formats, there's cloud services,\nthings of that nature,\n\n111\n00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.162\nwhere you can access data\nthrough the Internet, or\n\n112\n00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:21.989\nthrough a flash media,\nmaybe like a USB drive.\n\n113\n00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:25.135\nThose have become kind of\nthe letter of the day.\n\n114\n00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:29.551\nBut, like Wes said, every now and then,\nwhat you've got in your hand is a disk and\n\n115\n00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.100\nthat is how you need to install something.\n\n116\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.630\nPeople are still, and\nI would say, enough, sharing,\n\n117\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.210\nusing disks and putting format or\nmedia on that disk.\n\n118\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.540\nIt is a media, I'm sorry.\n\n119\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.404\nSoftware, programs,\napplications, files and\n\n120\n00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.230\nfolders are still getting stored to disk,\nso you might need this.\n\n121\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.410\nIf you don't, your customer says,\nyou know what, I don't need that,\n\n122\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.880\nI hardly ever use DVDs anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.050\nActually, I don't use them anymore,\nso don't worry about that.\n\n124\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.390\nYou can find a cheap one, and we've\ngot no room for it, maybe that's fine.\n\n125\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.382\nBut if not, you might be able to\nsave a little money on this part.\n\n126\n00:07:01.382 --> 00:07:04.477\n>> Yeah, because if somebody says,\noh, I don't need it right now, and\n\n127\n00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:07.729\nI'm just using external, a lot of times\nthe externals are going to be more\n\n128\n00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.690\nexpensive than any of the internal disks.\n\n129\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.540\nSo again, if you're on a budget,\nit does make sense to go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.240\nbuy the internal optical drive, whatever\nthe format is that you have to support.\n\n131\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.700\nAnd you'll see, even with some of\nthe newer formats like Blu-ray,\n\n132\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.270\nyou'll see the price come down over time.\n\n133\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.030\nSo, just like any technology,\nthe longer it's around,\n\n134\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.530\nthe cheaper it typically gets.\n\n135\n00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.310\n>> That's right.\n\n136\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.800\nNow, another component we commonly see or\n\n137\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.000\nadd into our computers is\nthat of a video adapter.\n\n138\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.220\nAnd there's many of which to choose from,\n\n139\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.220\nup from high end gaming adapters down\nto the low bargain bin that just gives\n\n140\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.460\nyou a nice display you can\nuse a workstation for.\n\n141\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.890\nWhat we need, is gonna, again,\nit's gonna depend on that customer.\n\n142\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.324\nNow Wes, you pulled up a few\nof these to take a look at.\n\n143\n00:07:49.324 --> 00:07:50.935\n>> Yeah, and\nthese are the fun things, too.\n\n144\n00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:53.215\nWhen we start talking\nabout graphics cards,\n\n145\n00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:55.921\nwe can start putting a lot\nof power into our machines.\n\n146\n00:07:55.921 --> 00:07:59.694\nAnd for the most part,\nwe've kept it kinda mid range here.\n\n147\n00:07:59.694 --> 00:08:03.861\nBut you can easily surpass your\nbudget in just a single card.\n\n148\n00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:07.180\nSo you have to pick and\nchoose and be careful.\n\n149\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.240\nSo you'll see that there's many\ndifferent selections out here, and\n\n150\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.200\nthey even got different categories,\nright, the enthusiasts.\n\n151\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.450\nSo this is the one that'll probably\nshut down whoever's providing\n\n152\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.150\nyour power there in the city.\n\n153\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.580\nPerformance cards, mainstream\nvideo cards and even value cards.\n\n154\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.490\nNow before we get into the categories\nhere, if you're one of these end\n\n155\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.075\nusers that's maybe going to do some\nkind of video processing with this,\n\n156\n00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:34.690\nyou have to figure out does\nthe board supports multiple cards?\n\n157\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.016\nIs that going to be\nsomething that you're going?\n\n158\n00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:42.003\nIf you're going to require a multiple card\nsetup, you have to pay attention again to\n\n159\n00:08:42.003 --> 00:08:45.120\nmotherboard technologies like SLI and\nCrossfire.\n\n160\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.910\nGuys, just technical jargon for\ntaking more than one video card and\n\n161\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.130\nputting them together.\n\n162\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.720\nSo that really is going to also be\nsomething that you have to consider.\n\n163\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.010\nThe other thing that we might want to\nconsider too is the power requirements.\n\n164\n00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.990\nCuz as you add these cards, you're gonna\nadd a little bit more demand for power.\n\n165\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.150\nSo since we're on a budget, I think what\nwe'll do here is we'll stick to a value\n\n166\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.790\nvideo card here, and we'll look and\nfind, let's see here.\n\n167\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.365\nWe've got a couple here.\n\n168\n00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:12.470\nThirty bucks, that's not too bad.\n\n169\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.170\nA DVI, VGA, there's another thing that\nyou're gonna wanna pay attention to,\n\n170\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.890\nthe output of the video card.\n\n171\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.730\nAgain, what kind of monitor do you have?\n\n172\n00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.940\nIf the customer already has a monitor, you\nmight wanna question them and say, okay,\n\n173\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.190\nwell, what are the cables,\nand they might not know.\n\n174\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.840\nBut what are the cables and connectors\nthat you have available on the monitor\n\n175\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.680\nbecause if they only have things\nlike display port and HDMI, well,\n\n176\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.960\none of these cards here that can save you\nmoney, you can see looking at this card,\n\n177\n00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.610\nit looks like it has HDMI,\nso we'd be okay with that.\n\n178\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.850\nBut imagine if they take\ntheir machine home,\n\n179\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.550\nand their monitor just\nhappens to be display port.\n\n180\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.290\nWell, now you don't have a very happy\ncustomer because they've paid you this\n\n181\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.950\nmoney to get this computer built,\nand when they take it home,\n\n182\n00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.040\nunfortunately, they can't really use it.\n\n183\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.690\nSo the interface is\ngonna be important here.\n\n184\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.610\nLet's see if we can find one that's\na little bit more modern here.\n\n185\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.624\nAnd you can see some that\nsupport multiple outputs.\n\n186\n00:10:06.624 --> 00:10:10.240\nAnd notice that the prices\nare fairly cheap here.\n\n187\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.960\nThey're not too bad.\n\n188\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.840\nAnd you can see that there are starting\nto get a little bit more expensive.\n\n189\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.680\nSo, tell you what, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll take this Nvidia GeForce card here.\n\n190\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.100\nFor the most part,\nit's not too expensive, about 48 bucks.\n\n191\n00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.430\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nthrow that into the loop.\n\n192\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.440\nNow, again,\npay attention to that motherboard.\n\n193\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.000\nMake sure it's got PCI-E\nslots available to\n\n194\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:40.120\ninstall this card, especially if you're\nthinking about maybe upgrading it later.\n\n195\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.800\nYou wanna make sure what slots\nare available, so we'll go ahead and\n\n196\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.970\nadd the video card.\n\n197\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.300\nYou do want to consider things like\nif you are going with a video card,\n\n198\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.910\nit has a what's known as\nyour graphics memory there,\n\n199\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.720\nand depending on what\nperformance levels you need,\n\n200\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.730\nit'll say how many of the graphical\nprocessing units are on it.\n\n201\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.820\nAnd again, you don't have to get complex,\nbecause if you're not doing gaming,\n\n202\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.440\nyou're not trying to squeeze\nout every frame per second,\n\n203\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.520\nthen a lot of times what you'll see is\nyou'll pay the money for these cards, and\n\n204\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.790\nyou never get the performance out of them.\n\n205\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.110\nNow, that's not always the case,\n\n206\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.170\nbecause gamers will definitely\nget their performance levels out.\n\n207\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.800\nBut again, keep in mind, this is\na budget build for an average end user.\n\n208\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.581\nSo I would say probably\nlike this little $48,\n\n209\n00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:26.780\n$50 card here will probably\nbe as much as they need.\n\n210\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.180\nAnd it could be more so than that,\n\n211\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.830\nso definitely pay attention to what\nthe customer's requirement is.\n\n212\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.850\n>> Yeah.\nIt doesn't make a whole lot of sense to\n\n213\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.560\nslam in a gaming video card,\ninto somebody that just needs it for\n\n214\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.290\ndoing presentations, surfing the web,\nmaybe watching online video,\n\n215\n00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.770\nthings of that nature.\n\n216\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.095\nThat would be overkill.\n\n217\n00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:46.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they'd be like, wow,\n\n218\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.550\nthis thing was really expensive,\nand I really don't use it for that.\n\n219\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.960\nAnd then they're gonna think you don't\nknow what you're talking about, and\n\n220\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.220\nyou don't know what you're doing.\n\n221\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.430\nSo that is a good way for you to show that\nyou are listening to the customer's needs.\n\n222\n00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.710\nAnd saying, hey, if you're not doing\nall that high-end graphics work,\n\n223\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.110\nwe don't need a large graphics card.\n\n224\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.640\nI know they sound cool,\nI know they're expensive and you think,\n\n225\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.630\nthe more money I spend,\nthe better I'm getting.\n\n226\n00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.283\nAnd don't get me wrong, they are better\ncards, but you'll never use it.\n\n227\n00:12:11.283 --> 00:12:13.719\nIt's like buying a Ferrari and\nparking it in the garage, right?\n\n228\n00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:14.463\n>> Yes.\n\n229\n00:12:14.463 --> 00:12:17.540\n>> You never use it, so\nwhat's the point of having the thing?\n\n230\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.519\nThey're nice to look at, but\nit can become a little impractical.\n\n231\n00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.930\n>> I can give you an example of it.\n\n232\n00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:30.030\nWhen I bought my machine, the machine\nthat I built, it was a fairly decent rig,\n\n233\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.220\nbut I'm using it for virtualization.\n\n234\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.970\nSo what also did I have, well,\nI am building my first machine here,\n\n235\n00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.990\nI've got to have the latest and\ngreatest best video adapter.\n\n236\n00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.486\nI don't think I've probably used 25% of\nthat video adapter [LAUGH] since it's been\n\n237\n00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:44.777\nup there, because, well,\nit's not what I use it for.\n\n238\n00:12:44.777 --> 00:12:48.986\nSo again, one of the things that you might\nsee, is you can save your customer money,\n\n239\n00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:52.721\nif you know that they're not going to\nget the full utilization of the card,\n\n240\n00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:54.400\nyou can tone it down a little bit.\n\n241\n00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.840\nYou don't have to get a 2, 3, $400 card\ncuz some of these cards can get so\n\n242\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.568\nexpensive that I've seen some cards\nthat are $5,000 just for the card alone.\n\n243\n00:13:01.568 --> 00:13:02.415\n>> Whoa.\n>> Right.\n\n244\n00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.588\nExactly.\n\n245\n00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:07.992\nThat's at ten times or\nbetter above our budget.\n\n246\n00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:09.650\nSo you gotta be careful.\n\n247\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.961\n>> Not for us.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n248\n00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:13.715\n>> It's for me if Dan's paying for it.\n\n249\n00:13:13.715 --> 00:13:14.640\n>> That's right.\n\n250\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.510\nI'll take two.\n\n251\n00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.305\n>> That's right.\n\n252\n00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now like he was saying,\n\n253\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.700\nyou can spend some money on these\nthings if they need the high-end stuff.\n\n254\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.400\nYou can also save some\nmoney on these things.\n\n255\n00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.750\nMaybe you even wanna go even cheaper.\n\n256\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.530\nSay maybe they're really,\nreally tight on the budget, and\n\n257\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.990\nthey wanna keep it as close as possible,\nmaybe just go with that onboard video.\n\n258\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.530\nMake sure that when you\nbuy the motherboard,\n\n259\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.650\nthat it supports onboard video.\n\n260\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.700\nYou don't even have to go\nwith an external card.\n\n261\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.660\nSo just realize that is an option for\nthe budget-minded customers, and\n\n262\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.690\nkeep that in mind.\n\n263\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.670\nNow Wes, moving on into other things\nthat we need to put into this guy.\n\n264\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.920\nSound, I know, I don't know about you,\nbut I know for myself.\n\n265\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.520\nI do like to hear when I'm watching\nYouTube videos or watching ITProTv,\n\n266\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.900\nit helps if I can actually\nhear the presenters.\n\n267\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.650\nSo sounds is probably important.\n\n268\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.100\nSound cards is what we're gonna need.\n\n269\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.610\n>> That's right.\n\n270\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.080\nSo sound cards is another\none of those things that\n\n271\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.705\nyou really just have to pay attention\nto the needs of the end user.\n\n272\n00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:11.050\nBecause obviously, this is not an episode\non what's the best sound card, but\n\n273\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.240\nyou have two to one surround sound.\n\n274\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.950\nThey might need five to one, seven to one,\n\n275\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.700\ndepending on, again,\nwhat the end user is going to need.\n\n276\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.550\nNow, again, these can be very,\nvery expensive.\n\n277\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.030\nThey can also be fairly economical, again,\n\n278\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.610\nif you're trying to stick\nwithin your budget.\n\n279\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.490\nFor instance, I've got some sound\ncards pulled up here, and for\n\n280\n00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.650\nthe most part, you're gonna see\nthey're not really too expensive.\n\n281\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.080\nWe could see $30 range, I'm sure if I\nwas to sort this from highest to lowest,\n\n282\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.650\nwe'd probably have some that\nare more studio quality for\n\n283\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.320\nmaybe audio production and stuff.\n\n284\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.870\nAnd that might be what you need,\nbut let's see here.\n\n285\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.410\nOh, there we go, you can see one there,\n$179 just for the card itself.\n\n286\n00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.860\nJust to have sound.\n\n287\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.130\nSo I'll tell you what.\n\n288\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.700\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's take one of these here.\n\n289\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.920\nIt's average,\nit's not two to one surround.\n\n290\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.060\nIt's not seven to one surround,\nthis is five to one here.\n\n291\n00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.860\nAnd it is, let's see,\nthat's about 35 bucks or so,\n\n292\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.900\nit doesn't add too much there.\n\n293\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.570\nOne of the things you\nwanna keep in mind is\n\n294\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.850\nwhether the user is actually\ngonna take advantage of this.\n\n295\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.280\nAgain, they could take advantage of this.\n\n296\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.850\nBut there again, it could be one of\nthose things where if you install it\n\n297\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.190\nthat they're not really\ngetting the full utilization.\n\n298\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:31.910\nSo again, quality is really relative\nto whatever the requirements are.\n\n299\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.055\nThe other thing you might want to keep\nin mind too is what kind of ports,\n\n300\n00:15:36.055 --> 00:15:38.155\nwhat kind of interfaces does it have?\n\n301\n00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:41.485\nWe've talked about the surround sound,\nif they need surround capabilities,\n\n302\n00:15:41.485 --> 00:15:43.315\ntwo to one, five to one, seven to one.\n\n303\n00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:44.675\nBut then what are the ports?\n\n304\n00:15:44.675 --> 00:15:47.005\nAre you gonna be dealing with FireWire?\n\n305\n00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:49.887\nYou'll see Ssmetimes these sound\ncards have FireWire on them.\n\n306\n00:15:49.887 --> 00:15:52.501\nAgain, you could see your audio jacks.\n\n307\n00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:56.084\nSo there again, just make sure that\nwhatever the end user says, hey,\n\n308\n00:15:56.084 --> 00:15:59.973\nwe need some good sound, that might be\nthe direction that they're going You\n\n309\n00:15:59.973 --> 00:16:03.312\nmight want to go ahead and\nput one of these cards in the system, and\n\n310\n00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:06.230\nagain give the end user\na better user experience.\n\n311\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.446\n>> Yeah, I know for myself,\nI am a musician I've done a little bit of\n\n312\n00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:12.859\nrecording and home recording stuff\nis getting very, very popular.\n\n313\n00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:16.056\nPeople wanna build machines that\ncan handle software like pro tools,\n\n314\n00:16:16.056 --> 00:16:19.634\nyou need a good sound card if you're gonna\nwork with that kind of stuff make sure\n\n315\n00:16:19.634 --> 00:16:20.625\nthe quality is good.\n\n316\n00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:24.569\nBut if you're just saying yeah, I just\nwanna some YouTube videos I wanna watch\n\n317\n00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:28.870\nsome ITProTv, well, you're probably\nnot gonna need those higher end cards.\n\n318\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.280\nSo, again it's all about finding\nwhat the customer needs and\n\n319\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.910\npurchasing accordingly to what\nthey're actually asking you for.\n\n320\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.740\nAll right, let's move on.\n\n321\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.300\nWell now that we've got all these\nwonderful components that we've picked out\n\n322\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.755\nfor our cool computer that we're building,\nthis nice custom awesomeness.\n\n323\n00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We actually need to power the thing,\n\n324\n00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.860\nwe need to feed the beast, and\nthat's gonna come down to power supply.\n\n325\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.580\n>> That's right, that's a very,\nvery important thing to have.\n\n326\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.240\nWhen we look at some of\nthe things on power supplies.\n\n327\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.830\nWell, first of all,\nyou might need to calculate.\n\n328\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.497\nWell how much power are you\nactually gonna need?\n\n329\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.370\nAre you gonna need a 350 watt power\nsupply, you gonna need a 450 watt,\n\n330\n00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.240\nyou gonna need a 750 watt.\n\n331\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.290\nAre you gonna need a kilowatt?\n\n332\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.100\nYou never know.\n\n333\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.210\n[LAUGH] Probably not in this build,\n\n334\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.560\nthat'll be a little bit too\nmuch of an over kill there.\n\n335\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.532\nBut one of the great things that they have\nout there is, a power supply calculator.\n\n336\n00:17:23.532 --> 00:17:27.699\nSo if we need to know, how much wattage do\nwe need in our systems, we can always go\n\n337\n00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:31.432\nto a calculator, a lot of times they'll\nhave some kind of online form or\n\n338\n00:17:31.432 --> 00:17:33.200\nsomething that you can fill out.\n\n339\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.942\nAnd again go through and\n\n340\n00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:39.700\ncalculate whatever the needs of\nthe overall system unit are.\n\n341\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.560\nSo we've actually got one\nof those pulled up here.\n\n342\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.220\nLet's see, desktop.\n\n343\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.900\nSo notice our motherboard here.\n\n344\n00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.850\nAsks us what CPU are we gonna use, and\nnow you'll see in the first part of this,\n\n345\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.150\nwe went ahead and selected Intel,\nso we can select Intel here.\n\n346\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.570\nAnd it's gonna ask us, well what\ntype of processor do we have, and\n\n347\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.490\nthe socket that we had on that,\nlet's see if it's in the list here.\n\n348\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.259\nIt should be a 1250 or on 11,\n\n349\n00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:12.130\n1151 that's a little bit newer,\nbut that'll be okay.\n\n350\n00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.040\nLet's see, one CPU and\nyou don't need this,\n\n351\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.220\nif you're gonna have multiple CPUs\nyou need that other selection.\n\n352\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.720\nBut we don't have that and let's see,\nwe have some modules here.\n\n353\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.880\nWe have two modules, and I think we\nwent with the two, let's see here.\n\n354\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.550\nThere we go, two four gigabyte modules,\nthat's what we had kinda chose.\n\n355\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:39.400\nAll right, and our video card we went\n\n356\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.350\nwith the NVIDIA, let's make sure\nthat we put that brand there.\n\n357\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.330\nAnd we're only gonna use\none NVIDIA card here.\n\n358\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.300\nAnd let's go with one of the smaller ones.\n\n359\n00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.400\nHard Drives, we settled on\na traditional hard drive here\n\n360\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.100\nrather than the SSD, 7200 RPM.\n\n361\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.253\nOptical drives, only one, and\nwe went with a DVD rewrite,\n\n362\n00:19:07.253 --> 00:19:11.253\nmultiple formats here, and\nwe could choose Calculate.\n\n363\n00:19:11.253 --> 00:19:12.761\n404 watts.\n\n364\n00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:17.179\nNow, this calculator, I want you to\nunderstand, 404 watts is saying,\n\n365\n00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:20.837\nI'm gonna fill my car so\nthat I can drive to my destination, and\n\n366\n00:19:20.837 --> 00:19:24.720\nthe moment I pull up to my destination,\nthe gas runs out of the car.\n\n367\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.920\nWell, we usually don't plan for trips\nthat way, so this is what they give you,\n\n368\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.950\na good ballpark on about the range that\nyou're gonna need for this machine.\n\n369\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.810\nBut, guys, that really is the bare\nminimum, you're gonna wanna exceed that.\n\n370\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:43.254\nIt's better to have more power than\nyou need than not enough power.\n\n371\n00:19:43.254 --> 00:19:46.790\nIf you don't have enough power then what\nyou can do is you can run into system\n\n372\n00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.642\ninstabilities.\n\n373\n00:19:47.642 --> 00:19:50.751\nAnd again you can cause some\ncrashes within the system and\n\n374\n00:19:50.751 --> 00:19:52.580\nultimately damage components.\n\n375\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.460\nSo I would say for me, and again this\nis a personal opinion that I would\n\n376\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.900\nprobably exceed it by a couple of\nhundred watts just to make sure\n\n377\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.590\nthat you're within the range,\ngiven our calculations here.\n\n378\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.020\nAnd then another thing too,\nis for expandability.\n\n379\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.950\nWe only put a single video card in this.\n\n380\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.610\nMaybe later we wanna\nput another video card.\n\n381\n00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.100\nMaybe we wanna put in some additional\ndrives if we didn't have them because,\n\n382\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.800\nagain this is a budget build.\n\n383\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.480\nWell now, if we only had a 500\nwatt power supply we'd be kinda\n\n384\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.470\nlimited into what we could do.\n\n385\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.190\nWe're gonna add memory later,\nthe board that we supported,\n\n386\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:29.670\nwe only went with eight gigs of RAM at\nfirst but it scales out to 32 gigs of RAM.\n\n387\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.130\nSo for the most part RAM doesn't\ntake too much wattage but\n\n388\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.930\nit could be something that we need here.\n\n389\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:40.870\nSo we've actually got a power\nsupply up here and let's see here.\n\n390\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.340\nSome of the other things that you\ngotta think about too are these little\n\n391\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.570\nspecifications here.\n\n392\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.430\nLet's see if I can,\noops, that didn't work.\n\n393\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.302\nGet back to our, right here you\ngot to watch these specifications.\n\n394\n00:20:52.302 --> 00:20:54.887\nATX 12 volt and EPS 12 volt.\n\n395\n00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:58.130\nNow, that's a bunch of standards and\nspecifications guys.\n\n396\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.482\nBasically what that means for us,\nis things like the power connectors.\n\n397\n00:21:02.482 --> 00:21:06.420\nYour motherboard, all right,\nyour power supply, and\n\n398\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.070\nyour case have to have\nthe same form factor.\n\n399\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.100\nAnd for the most part when\nwe talk about form factor,\n\n400\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.060\nwe're talking about the dimensions of\nwhatever the device is or component.\n\n401\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.230\nBut when you're talking about motherboards\nand you're talking about power supply\n\n402\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.710\nform factors, you're also talking about\nadditional characteristics or attributes.\n\n403\n00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.980\nAnd one of the big ones is that power\nconnector that you see on the motherboard,\n\n404\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.500\nover the years it's gone through a 20,\n20 plus 4 and a 24 pin connector.\n\n405\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.400\nAnd you also need to pay attention when we\ntalk about some of these connectors here.\n\n406\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.015\nYou have to pay attention\nto whether you have enough.\n\n407\n00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:43.287\nDo I have enough for my serial ATA drives?\n\n408\n00:21:43.287 --> 00:21:46.385\nIf this is what I'm putting in,\ndo I have enough for any,\n\n409\n00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:50.040\nif you're powering video cards,\ndo you have enough for that?\n\n410\n00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.130\nThe other thing too, is you typically\nwith these multi core processors today,\n\n411\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:59.010\nyou'll have a multiple pin connector for\n\n412\n00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.740\nthe CPU and has a dedicated rail or\nvoltage going to the CPU.\n\n413\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.821\nAnd for a long time it was\na four pin connector but\n\n414\n00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:07.703\ntoday you'll see an eight pin connector.\n\n415\n00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:10.105\nSo those standards even\nthough it's a bunch of,\n\n416\n00:22:10.105 --> 00:22:14.490\nit seems like a bunch of jargon definitely\npay attention to the specifications.\n\n417\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.290\nThe other thing that should be and\nI don't see it, oh yeah, there it is.\n\n418\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.030\n80 plus,\nyou might be looking at efficiency.\n\n419\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.020\nSo, energy efficiency we've got our\nwattage, we got our energy efficiency.\n\n420\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.365\nThat's a recommendation, it just means\nthat at certain levels you're gonna get\n\n421\n00:22:31.365 --> 00:22:34.930\n80% more efficiency than you would with\none that doesn't have that stamp on it.\n\n422\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.310\nNow, it's not a regulated standard, guys.\n\n423\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.820\nIt's a voluntary type thing that people\nwho make power supplies can get into.\n\n424\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.230\nSo it's not heavily regulated.\n\n425\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.180\nNotice that this power supply, another\nconsideration for your power supplies.\n\n426\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.040\nNow this is cool.\n\n427\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.201\nI like this Dan.\n\n428\n00:22:52.201 --> 00:22:54.746\nNotice that there is not a single\nwire coming off of the back of that\n\n429\n00:22:54.746 --> 00:22:55.359\npower supply.\n\n430\n00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:56.670\n>> I did notice that.\n\n431\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.230\n>> That's right.\n\n432\n00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.480\nSo we talked about cooling.\n\n433\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.200\nRight?\n\n434\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.680\nYou might have seen, and if you haven't,\n\n435\n00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.660\nyou're in the right spot,\npower supplies that have fixed wiring.\n\n436\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.820\nAll right?\nFixed wiring generally means that if\n\n437\n00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.140\nyou're not using those cables,\nwe're gonna try to bundle them up,\n\n438\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.310\ndoing cable management, but\nthey can also restrict air flow.\n\n439\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.000\nThis is known as a modular power supply,\nand personally, I like the modular power\n\n440\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.650\nsupplies because I only have to\nadd the connectors that I need.\n\n441\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.100\nIf I don't need it,\nI don't need to add it.\n\n442\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.065\nI don't need to worry\nabout cable management.\n\n443\n00:23:27.065 --> 00:23:29.910\nBecause you have to, another thing you\nhave to worry about to are the cabling\n\n444\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.420\nitself that comes off to\nthe back of the power supply.\n\n445\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.330\nBecause some of these\npower supplies can be\n\n446\n00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.170\nextremely difficult to route the cables.\n\n447\n00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.730\nBecause of very stiff cables,\nI've got a 1,000 watt power supply that\n\n448\n00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.980\nI should have paid attention\nto my own advice on this one.\n\n449\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.566\nBecause when the, even though\nI'm only using, its modular, and\n\n450\n00:23:48.566 --> 00:23:52.344\nI'm only using the connectors that I need,\nthat power connector that\n\n451\n00:23:52.344 --> 00:23:55.887\ngoes down to the motherboard,\nit's almost impossible to bend.\n\n452\n00:23:55.887 --> 00:24:00.744\nIt's got good shielding on it so\nlet's definitely take advantage of\n\n453\n00:24:00.744 --> 00:24:04.443\nthe modular power supply but\nalso do your research.\n\n454\n00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.023\nReviews.\n\n455\n00:24:05.023 --> 00:24:08.279\nWe've talked about in the first part\nof this episode, looking at and\n\n456\n00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:10.302\ndoing your research, doing your review,\n\n457\n00:24:10.302 --> 00:24:13.180\nfinding out what other people\nthink about the power supply.\n\n458\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.871\nYou might end up coming in and\nfinding some tips that somebody says,\n\n459\n00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:18.762\nwell this is a great power supply.\n\n460\n00:24:18.762 --> 00:24:21.751\nIt's just not easy to route the cables\nwhich again, I should used,\n\n461\n00:24:21.751 --> 00:24:25.002\nI should have took some of my own advice\nbecause I found out after the fact,\n\n462\n00:24:25.002 --> 00:24:26.860\nsomebody says, oh I love it.\n\n463\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.730\nBut good luck trying to hide those wires,\nso\n\n464\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.370\nyou definitely want,\nmodular power supplies, I think.\n\n465\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.870\nPoint being here are better for\nthe cooling and the system overall.\n\n466\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.395\nThe other thing to keep in mind\nis make sure that the fan,\n\n467\n00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:41.881\nhow loud the fan is on the power supply.\n\n468\n00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:45.585\nMost often, they're ultra-quiet,\nbut if you're building a system for\n\n469\n00:24:45.585 --> 00:24:49.468\nsomebody that maybe is using speech\nrecognition technology, maybe they've\n\n470\n00:24:49.468 --> 00:24:53.559\ngot some physical impairment and they're\nusing voice recognition technology.\n\n471\n00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:57.931\nThe louder the system gets the less\nthe persons gonna like it if\n\n472\n00:24:57.931 --> 00:25:00.720\nthey're using that kind of software.\n\n473\n00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.710\nSo all in all,\nmake sure it's not too loud either.\n\n474\n00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.590\n>> Yeah, you don't wanna bunch\nof ambient noise going on,\n\n475\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.770\nI mean they can just be\nannoying to be honest with you.\n\n476\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.790\nA lot of CPU fans, they get super loud.\n\n477\n00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.290\nThese fans for\nthe power supplies they can be super loud.\n\n478\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.880\nYou got two of them going at each other,\n\n479\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.970\nit sounds like a choir of noise\ncoming out of that thing.\n\n480\n00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.020\nSo you do wanna check and see is this\na good fan, is it nice and quiet and\n\n481\n00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.520\nstill give the power that I need that\ncan definitely be a consideration for\n\n482\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.110\nyour end user.\n\n483\n00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.080\nAll right, now Wes,\n\n484\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.150\nwe've covered a lot of stuff, we've looked\nover a lot of different components.\n\n485\n00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.580\nI totally like those modular\npower slides by the way.\n\n486\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.984\nThat is the way to fly, in my book.\n\n487\n00:25:36.984 --> 00:25:38.167\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n488\n00:25:38.167 --> 00:25:40.060\n>> I'm gonna take advantage of\nthat next time I need to buy one.\n\n489\n00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.720\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n490\n00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.320\n>> But have we come in under budget?\n\n491\n00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.450\n>> I don't know.\nLet's find out.\n\n492\n00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.713\nHere we go, drum roll please.\n\n493\n00:25:45.713 --> 00:25:46.580\n>> That's right.\n\n494\n00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.210\n>> Let's see, so\nwe did a optical drive at 35 bucks,\n\n495\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.280\nyou wanna help me out here\nwith a calculator here?\n\n496\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.100\n>> Sure.\n\n497\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.385\n>> I'll challenge my\nmathematical capabilities.\n\n498\n00:25:54.385 --> 00:26:01.791\nThe video adapter I believe we said\nwas a little bit more expensive, 74.\n\n499\n00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:02.883\nSo, here's what I got so far.\n\n500\n00:26:02.883 --> 00:26:06.760\nI've got 70 bucks.\n\n501\n00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.562\n>> 70?\n\n502\n00:26:07.562 --> 00:26:10.070\n>> Yeah, that's for our case.\n\n503\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:15.917\nAnd i got a 109 so add these up here 70,\n\n504\n00:26:15.917 --> 00:26:19.495\n109, 199, 34.\n\n505\n00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:22.720\nWe've got $13 for our cooling system.\n\n506\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.460\nWe've got a four-pack of 120\nmillimeter fans there, so\n\n507\n00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.120\nthat one worked out really good for us.\n\n508\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.571\nAnd let's see, where are we at here?\n\n509\n00:26:30.571 --> 00:26:31.907\nWhat was the last one you got there?\n\n510\n00:26:31.907 --> 00:26:33.520\nThe cooling system was 13 bucks.\n\n511\n00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.570\nWe got RAM, we did 80 bucks for our RAM.\n\n512\n00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.800\nAll right,\noptical drive that was about 35 bucks.\n\n513\n00:26:44.387 --> 00:26:51.724\nVideo adapter, we went with $74 and\nsound card was 35 bucks.\n\n514\n00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.017\nLet me double back here\non this power supply and\n\n515\n00:26:58.017 --> 00:27:02.400\nthat is gonna be just around 80 bucks so\nthat's $79 there.\n\n516\n00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.623\nAnd the total-\n>> The grand total is well we came in\n\n517\n00:27:06.623 --> 00:27:09.944\ninside of our budget it was $729.\n\n518\n00:27:09.944 --> 00:27:11.348\n>> All right, very good.\n\n519\n00:27:11.348 --> 00:27:13.021\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right in the middle.\n\n520\n00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:15.550\n>> That's right so\nwe've covered a lot of stuff, right?\n\n521\n00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.250\nWe covered our case and\nwhat you need to know about the case.\n\n522\n00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.320\nRemember form factor,\neverything's gotta fit inside of it.\n\n523\n00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.480\nSame thing goes with your power supply,\nso let's recap that real quick.\n\n524\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.370\nCase, motherboard, power supply.\n\n525\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.330\nThree of the form factors you\nabsolutely have to have match.\n\n526\n00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.940\nThe motherboard,\nmake sure your connectors are there.\n\n527\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.480\nMake sure that you have enough\nRAM that can be supported.\n\n528\n00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.410\nYou don't have to go really\nexpensive on your RAM.\n\n529\n00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.798\nIf you need video adapters and\nif you need sound cards, all right.\n\n530\n00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:47.318\nYou can put them in the system, but we can\nprobably even reduce the price a little\n\n531\n00:27:47.318 --> 00:27:50.761\nbit more if we wanted to by going\nwith an onboard video card and\n\n532\n00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:54.678\nan onboard sound card might give us\nsome little bit more spending room\n\n533\n00:27:54.678 --> 00:27:57.819\nlike Dan said earlier on\nwhat really counts, the RAM.\n\n534\n00:27:57.819 --> 00:28:01.162\nWe put in our optical drives,\nwe put in our video adapter,\n\n535\n00:28:01.162 --> 00:28:04.110\nsound card, and then finally,\nthe power supply.\n\n536\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.250\nSo a lot of components in there,\na lot of considerations.\n\n537\n00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.038\nDo your research.\n\n538\n00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:13.016\nMake sure that if you're trying to set\nyour budget before you even start,\n\n539\n00:28:13.016 --> 00:28:15.199\ntry to stay within your budget.\n\n540\n00:28:15.199 --> 00:28:17.865\nAnd then if you can go with\nsomebody's integrated features,\n\n541\n00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:21.247\nyou could turn around and say, we need\na little bit more money and then, well,\n\n542\n00:28:21.247 --> 00:28:24.630\nyou can shift some of that money into\nmaybe the components that are most crucial\n\n543\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.230\nto whatever the bill is gonna be.\n\n544\n00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.980\n>> That's right.\n\n545\n00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.550\nWell, Wes, this has been a lot of fun, and\n\n546\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.800\nhopefully you out there now have a better\nidea of what it takes in the pre\n\n547\n00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.580\nplanning stages when someone's asking you,\nhey can you build a computer for me?\n\n548\n00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.520\nHelp me build one out, budget that out.\n\n549\n00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.140\nNow you know what it takes,\nwhat you gotta do, all the pitfalls and\n\n550\n00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.890\ncaveats that go along with it.\n\n551\n00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.440\nWes, thanks for\njoining us on the show today.\n\n552\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.310\n>> Oh man, it's been fun.\n\n553\n00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.820\n>> Great demonstrations.\n\n554\n00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.970\nHopefully, you guys got a lot out of that.\n\n555\n00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off though.\n\n556\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.170\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:17.610\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.590\nJoining me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.010\nHow you doing today, Wes?\n\n6\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.700\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.900\nIt's great to be here today.\n\n8\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.730\nToday we get to work\nwith a lot of components.\n\n9\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.300\nWe get to build a computer.\n\n10\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.250\nWe've got a whole bunch\nof components back here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.310\nA lot of fun stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.760\nWe got video cards,\nwe got liquid cooling systems.\n\n13\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.040\nWe got a massive video adapter.\n\n14\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.070\nWe got a lot of stuff going on and\nI just can't wait to get started.\n\n15\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.626\n>> Yeah, so our goal today is to take\nall those cool components that we got\n\n16\n00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:49.518\nsitting here a little off camera,\nover here on our cart,\n\n17\n00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.859\nwe're gonna try to put them all\ntogether and actually build a PC.\n\n18\n00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.367\nIf you watched the previous\ntech skill show,\n\n19\n00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.545\nwe showed you how to kind of shop for\nbuilding a custom PC.\n\n20\n00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:01.900\nSo we're gonna take those ideas that\nwe did on all those components that we\n\n21\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.782\nneed for this build, and\nnow we're gonna slap them together.\n\n22\n00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:07.836\nAnd hopefully when we hit the power button\nat the end of the show it fires up and\n\n23\n00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:09.685\nwe actually have a working computer.\n\n24\n00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:11.225\nThat's the goal anyway.\n\n25\n00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:12.535\n>> Just one beep, remember.\n\n26\n00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:14.653\nOne beep is good and anything else is bad.\n\n27\n00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:18.469\nSo one of the first things that we're\ngonna do is we're gonna start by well,\n\n28\n00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.021\ninstalling the motherboard,\n\n29\n00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:23.700\none of the main most crucial\ncomponents within the system.\n\n30\n00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.790\nOne of things that we always have\nto be careful with when you're\n\n31\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.030\nworking with computer circuitry or making\na build here, is electrostatic discharge.\n\n32\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.640\nSo one of the things that you're\ngonna notice is that I do have an ESD\n\n33\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.680\nwrist strap.\n\n34\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.867\nRemember when it comes to static charge,\n\n35\n00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:41.000\nit's not about what you can feel that's\ndetrimental to computer circuitry.\n\n36\n00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.824\nIt's more about what you can't feel.\n\n37\n00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:47.784\nNow when we go ahead and\nline up this back panel,\n\n38\n00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:50.520\nand be very careful here.\n\n39\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.509\nWe certainly don't wanna bend anything.\n\n40\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.600\nAnd then right in the middle of\nthe board here, there's a little post.\n\n41\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.710\nAnd that just makes sure that\nthe motherboard is all lined up and\n\n42\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.940\ngood to go here.\n\n43\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.670\nAnd the next thing we'll do is we'll go\nahead and we'll put the screws inside of\n\n44\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.090\nthe case here, and one of the things that\nI have is a little extension screwdriver.\n\n45\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.620\nThis thing, I tell you what, it's gonna\nsave you a lot of trouble when it comes to\n\n46\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.480\nthe installation of anything that\nyou really have to reach down into.\n\n47\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.250\nAnd so we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna put some screws in here.\n\n48\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.950\nAnd on the first couple of them,\n\n49\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.750\none of the things that I try not to\ndo is tighten them down too much.\n\n50\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.070\nAnd the reason I say that is because you\nmight not have it lined up just perfect.\n\n51\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.910\nNext thing that we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.760\nmount the motherboard now that we've\ngot it set down inside of the case.\n\n53\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.820\nAnd one of these guys,\nthe little extensions,\n\n54\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.440\ncome in very handy when you need\nto reach down inside of the case.\n\n55\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.330\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n56\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.570\nWe are going to put a couple\nof these screws in.\n\n57\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.300\nNow, be careful with these screws because\nyou might not have the mother board\n\n58\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.030\ncompletely lined up, you might see\nthat it moved a little bit there.\n\n59\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.149\nSo the first couple of ones,\nI don't really torque them down too much.\n\n60\n00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.450\n>> Do you have to worry about,\nlike, breaking the motherboard?\n\n61\n00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.636\nAs well as-\n>> Yes, you do.\n\n62\n00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.289\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> That's a good point, and\n\n63\n00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.830\nI'm glad you mentioned that too, Dan.\n\n64\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.190\nBecause another thing that\nyou might have to get,\n\n65\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.400\nis you might have to get standoffs.\n\n66\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.317\nAnd standoffs, we're not really\ntalking about the whole I dont know,\n\n67\n00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.990\ncowboys-type standoff here.\n\n68\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.960\n[LAUGH] But what we're talking about\nis it raises it up from the case.\n\n69\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.940\nIt'll prevent things\nlike short-circuiting.\n\n70\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.960\nWe don't want any bouncing on that case,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.600\nThe motherboard doesn't do well with that.\n\n72\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.610\nAnd the other thing it helps with too,\nis vibration.\n\n73\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.860\nNow keep in mind, be very careful\nwhen you're putting these in here,\n\n74\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.700\ncuz you certainly don't wanna see crack,\ncrack, crack or hear crack,\n\n75\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.760\ncrack, crack, you can see it,\nyou got really bad issues there.\n\n76\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.820\nNotice that I'm going around the outside\nof the case here with these screws,\n\n77\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.370\nit's just gonna make sure that\nwe are lined up and ready to go.\n\n78\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.010\nNow honestly, you might have\na method out there to do this.\n\n79\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.250\nAnd that's just fine.\n\n80\n00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.780\nI like to go around the outside\nof the motherboard first,\n\n81\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.450\nmaking sure that everything's squared up.\n\n82\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.320\nNow, another thing that I would definitely\nkeep in mind, Is that a lot of these\n\n83\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.080\ncases support multiple variations\nof the ATX form factor.\n\n84\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.590\nSo, again, the placement for\n\n85\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.060\nmounting the board could be\ninconsistent between case to case.\n\n86\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.742\nAnd that could definitely\ncause some issues there.\n\n87\n00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:36.538\nWe got one more over here, and\nthat should be it for the screws here.\n\n88\n00:04:36.538 --> 00:04:41.600\nNow, I'm surprised I haven't\ndropped one of these yet.\n\n89\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.388\nNow be careful if you do.\n\n90\n00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:49.445\nOne of the things I would suggest is\nhaving needle nosed pliers around.\n\n91\n00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:50.879\nJust in case.\n\n92\n00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.319\n>> No magnetic tip screw driver for us?\n\n93\n00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.838\n>> No we'll definitely stay off of those.\n\n94\n00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:58.888\nNow one of the things I can see is\nthat this isn't quite lined up,\n\n95\n00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:00.097\nbelieve it or not.\n\n96\n00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:03.296\nSo it's a good thing we haven't\ntorqued all those screws down yet and\n\n97\n00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:04.020\ndropped them.\n\n98\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.217\nThere we go!\n\n99\n00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:06.819\n>> It's not a case build without.\n\n100\n00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.174\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's never complete, you got it,\n\n101\n00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:11.439\nwithout at least dropping those screws.\n\n102\n00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.116\nJust try to make sure that at\nthe end of the build you don't have\n\n103\n00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.570\nscrews left over here.\n\n104\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.220\nBecause I'm so graceful,\nI decided that it was time to cut myself.\n\n105\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.830\nWell, we've got gloves on now, so,\nwell, you guys don't have to see that.\n\n106\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.050\nNext thing we're going to do here,\n\n107\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.005\nis we're going to install\nthe backing to the water cooler.\n\n108\n00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:34.300\nNow, typically a case, or a motherboard,\nwill come with a stock heat sync,\n\n109\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.100\nand you might have a back plate on\nit there that you have to remove.\n\n110\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.380\nWe've already done that.\n\n111\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.200\nBut let's go ahead.\n\n112\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.710\nWe're gonna tip this computer.\n\n113\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.630\nOr actually stand it up,\nI guess I should say.\n\n114\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.480\nAll right, now right here in this area,\n\n115\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.660\nthere is a little plate\nthat needs to be here and\n\n116\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.630\nthe stock heat sync that came with it,\nit already had it's little plate there.\n\n117\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.036\nBut, we've already gone ahead and\nremoved that.\n\n118\n00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:02.450\nAnd, now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna replace it with one that the water\n\n119\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.430\nblock itself is gonna attach to.\n\n120\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.470\nAnd all we're gonna do is put this, oh and\n\n121\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.780\none thing to keep in mind here,\nyou'll see that these slide.\n\n122\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.600\nAnd that it's important, one of the things\nI like to do if I'm gonna install this,\n\n123\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.910\nI'll put the top ones in first and\nthen you can just pull the bottom ones,\n\n124\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.070\nlike I'm doing, down there like that and\nthey fit right in.\n\n125\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.463\nNow it's fairly easy here.\n\n126\n00:06:25.463 --> 00:06:28.378\nAll I'm going to do,\nI've got a couple of other screws here and\n\n127\n00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:31.581\nwhat we're going to do is we're going\nto put these on the other side.\n\n128\n00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:37.075\nGot one in right there and\nwe're going to put another one here.\n\n129\n00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:39.513\nWe got four of these bad boys to put in.\n\n130\n00:06:39.513 --> 00:06:44.227\nAgain, if the base of it just\nmoves a little bit, it's okay..\n\n131\n00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:49.649\nJust slide that little washer back up and\n\n132\n00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.366\nwe can get this one.\n\n133\n00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:56.033\nAnd again I'm not tightening\nthese down too much yet\n\n134\n00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:59.630\nbecause we want to go ahead and\nget them installed.\n\n135\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:06.013\nAnd then once we know they're on there,\nand I'm not gonna go all graceful here and\n\n136\n00:07:06.013 --> 00:07:10.653\ndrop it, which I wouldn't,\nI'm not out of the woods yet.\n\n137\n00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:14.170\n>> Wes, I'm sure you've got plenty of time\nleft to make sure you've dropped screws.\n\n138\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.389\n>> Oh yes!\n\n139\n00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:17.049\n>> Cut yourself behind your gloves.\n\n140\n00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:19.557\n>> You better believe it.\n\n141\n00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:20.428\n>> I expect this to be a massacre\nby the end of the show.\n\n142\n00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:21.091\n>> That's right.\n\n143\n00:07:21.091 --> 00:07:24.960\nAll right, so\nfairly easy to put those on there.\n\n144\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.300\nYou can see I didn't torque them down yet.\n\n145\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.080\nThat'll give us a chance to\nlower the case back down.\n\n146\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.980\nWe can tighten them up and\n\n147\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.430\nI can show you a little trick to\nget these tightened a lot easier.\n\n148\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.444\nSo we've got the four posts,\nthe standoff posts for\n\n149\n00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:40.990\nthe water block that mounts here.\n\n150\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.240\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\nwe've got these little pieces here and\n\n151\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.414\nit makes it a little easier to\ntorque down these individual bolts.\n\n152\n00:07:51.414 --> 00:07:52.169\nI say that.\n\n153\n00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.813\n>> And\nWes has lost all feelings in his fingers.\n\n154\n00:07:57.813 --> 00:08:01.954\n>> [LAUGH] Yes and if you have to reach\nunder the case like I'm doing right here,\n\n155\n00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:03.875\nthat's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n156\n00:08:07.193 --> 00:08:10.191\nAnd I'm not going torque these down,\nlike I said,\n\n157\n00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:14.150\nall the way while we still\nhaven't put the water block on.\n\n158\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.910\nSo no reason to torque\nit down too much yet.\n\n159\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.185\n>> I think one thing that's\nbecome heir apparent here,\n\n160\n00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:25.855\nin our build is that this is\na bit of a physical activity.\n\n161\n00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:27.635\nYou're gonna get your hands dirty.\n\n162\n00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:29.285\nYou're gonna tackle some things.\n\n163\n00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:31.444\nAnd like you said,\nWesley's already cut himself.\n\n164\n00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.630\nIt's a little sharp in there.\n\n165\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.010\nYou do wanna be careful, but you're\ngonna have to manhandle these things.\n\n166\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.090\nDon't be afraid to actually\nmaneuver the case around.\n\n167\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.700\nMove that mother board around.\n\n168\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.260\nObviously, you want to be somewhat genteel\nbecause there are sensitive components,\n\n169\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.320\nbut don't be afraid of every, you know,\n\n170\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.400\nto move it, turn it,\npick up on it a little bit.\n\n171\n00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.660\nIt can take a little bit\nof torquing it down.\n\n172\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.810\n>> That's right, absolutely.\n\n173\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.440\nNow, one of the next things\nthat we have to figure out,\n\n174\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.090\nwhen you are putting the pieces together,\nin fact Dan and I, we were talking about\n\n175\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:05.040\nthis before we started here, there's not\nreally a right order and a wrong order.\n\n176\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.520\nOne of the things that we\nhave to worry about here,\n\n177\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.610\nis there are certain components\nthat if I went ahead and\n\n178\n00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.980\ninstalled something, well,\nI couldn't get the next component in here.\n\n179\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.600\nSo the next thing that\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n180\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.340\ninstall is, I'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall the RAM.\n\n181\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.780\nHere we've got some G.Skill memory.\n\n182\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.130\nFairly easy to install the memory,\none of the good things about it is\n\n183\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.100\nit's notched and\nyou can only put it in one way.\n\n184\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.570\nIf you put it in the wrong way,\n\n185\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.185\nwell then it's pretty much going to be one\nof these things that never works again.\n\n186\n00:09:32.185 --> 00:09:37.540\n[LAUGH] So just pay attention to that and\nyou'll see here, it's fairly easy.\n\n187\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.370\nJust line them up.\n\n188\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.153\nAnd one of the things that is kind of\ncool about these DIMM slots here is,\n\n189\n00:09:43.153 --> 00:09:44.785\nyou might be able to here this too.\n\n190\n00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:46.990\n[SOUND] Little click.\n\n191\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.219\n[SOUND] And fairly easy.\n\n192\n00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:52.510\nIf it's seated right,\nyou should get those clicks.\n\n193\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.520\nDo be careful.\n\n194\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.150\nI know that I I've done this before\nin putting a machine together,\n\n195\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.540\nwhere I was actually\nin-between the RAM slot.\n\n196\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.605\nIt's pretty easy to tell\ncuz it just falls out.\n\n197\n00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.949\n>> [LAUGH] It doesn't\ntend to be very sturdy.\n\n198\n00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:10.410\n>> No.\n>> It's missed the actual slot it's\n\n199\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.640\nsupposed to go into.\n\n200\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.784\n>> And notice one of the things that\nwe're trying to be careful with,\n\n201\n00:10:14.784 --> 00:10:17.046\nwe're not really trying\nto put too much force.\n\n202\n00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:21.572\nDan had already mentioned that when we\nwere installing the motherboard, that it's\n\n203\n00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:25.331\nnot a good day in the neighborhood here\nif you push down on this board and\n\n204\n00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:27.340\nyou hear crack crack.\n\n205\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.740\nSo just kinda be careful about that.\n\n206\n00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.727\nNow there's a reason that I'm\nputting in the memory first.\n\n207\n00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:36.740\nThis board, you're gonna see here.\n\n208\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.820\nThere we go, last click, there.\n\n209\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.140\nThis board right here is going to\nhave a liquid cooling radiator and\n\n210\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.550\na fan right here, and the problem with\nthat is it's gonna sit out about this far,\n\n211\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.480\nas you'll see coming up, and\nI couldn't get the RAM in or out.\n\n212\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.040\nSo like I said, not a right way or\n\n213\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.260\na wrong way when you're\ninstalling these components,\n\n214\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.070\njust make sure that sometimes you'll have\ncertain components that'll block others.\n\n215\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.880\n>> Yeah, so just be a little\nmindful as you're building it.\n\n216\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.140\nOh, this is actually gonna get in my way,\nso I might do this step first.\n\n217\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.640\n>> That, yeah, that's right, yup.\n\n218\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.030\nAll right Dan, the next thing we get\nto install is the fun part, right?\n\n219\n00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.090\nThe massive video card.\n\n220\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.694\nLooks like it's got a water\ntreatment plant here on the bottom.\n\n221\n00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:22.920\n>> That thing is no joke, that's for sure.\n\n222\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.826\n>> Yeah, I know.\nThis is a nice video card.\n\n223\n00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:30.690\nI think this is a One of the GTX 760,\nI believe.\n\n224\n00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.470\nSo it's a fairly good card here.\n\n225\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:37.080\nNow when this gets installed, we're\ngoing to install it in the PCIE slot.\n\n226\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.930\nBe careful with these cards here, because\nthis card, it's gargantuan to begin with.\n\n227\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:50.080\nAnd the other thing is, even though\nit only mounts in one PCIE slot,\n\n228\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.540\nit is so large that it actually takes\nup two of your expansion slots.\n\n229\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.820\nThat's why you'll see that like certain\nboards that support multiple video cards,\n\n230\n00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.690\nyou can only get a couple of\nthose cards in there just due to\n\n231\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.120\nthe clearance of this massive beast here.\n\n232\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.480\nAll right, so that's got that set up.\n\n233\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.180\nNext thing that we have to do here is\nwe'll lock this graphics card down,\n\n234\n00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.080\nand make sure that it doesn't go anywhere.\n\n235\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.740\nFairly easy to do.\n\n236\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.730\nIt's got a couple of adapter slot screws.\n\n237\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.090\nAnd you know what's interesting?\n\n238\n00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:32.990\nThey're one of the things I really\nlike about this case is all the screws\n\n239\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:39.210\nare pretty much the same and that\ndefinitely makes it a lot easier on us.\n\n240\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.780\n>> So if you lose the screws for\nthis you're not completely hosed.\n\n241\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.830\nNo, no, no.\n\n242\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.856\nYou don't wanna have spare parts, but\n\n243\n00:12:46.856 --> 00:12:53.211\nif you do end up having to mix and\nmatch, then you'll be okay.\n\n244\n00:12:55.137 --> 00:12:56.880\nThe best thing to do,\nthough, is not have to.\n\n245\n00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.240\n[LAUGH] Try to remember where all those\nscrews are and no spare parts at the end.\n\n246\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.720\nAll right, so\nwe'll torque that down just a little bit.\n\n247\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.497\nAnd towards the end we'll go back and\nwe'll double check and\n\n248\n00:13:10.497 --> 00:13:13.415\nwe'll make sure that all these\nconnections are good and\n\n249\n00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:17.227\nthat everything that has a screw in\nit has been torqued down pretty good.\n\n250\n00:13:17.227 --> 00:13:18.828\nSo the next thing that we're gonna do,\n\n251\n00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:20.825\nis we're going to install\nour network adapter.\n\n252\n00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:25.936\nNow you have to make sure you remove these\nscrews, because remember these screws\n\n253\n00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:30.836\nare what holds the adapter card down and\nmakes sure that it doesn't vibrate.\n\n254\n00:13:33.335 --> 00:13:34.885\nGet these out of here real quick.\n\n255\n00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:38.715\nAnd that's one of the things\nI like this case,\n\n256\n00:13:38.715 --> 00:13:43.020\nit's just got a lot of space to work with.\n\n257\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.290\nAnd a lot of customization, so\n\n258\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.810\nwe're gong to go ahead and\ninstall this, that down through here.\n\n259\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.400\nOkay, see,\nthere's a method to the madness.\n\n260\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.750\nThat's why we didn't install\nthe power supply, right?\n\n261\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.650\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\n262\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.059\n>> Again, logical progression, right?\n\n263\n00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:03.209\n>> That's right.\n>> Make sure you get all the stuff that's\n\n264\n00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.887\ngoing to be covered or blocked up put in\nand then we go with the rest of the thing.\n\n265\n00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:07.514\n>> That's right.\n\n266\n00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:10.429\nAnd before I install the next card,\n\n267\n00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:15.300\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ntorque this screw down a little bit.\n\n268\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.680\nAnd reason is, I wanna make sure\nthat this one is lined up and\n\n269\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.231\nthat doesn't interfere with that next one.\n\n270\n00:14:22.231 --> 00:14:28.318\nNow, we wanted to make sure that\nthis board supports USB 3.0,\n\n271\n00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:32.540\nso we got a small little\nUSB 3.0 card here.\n\n272\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.055\nAnd it's gonna fit in\nthe PCIE one lane slot here.\n\n273\n00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:39.375\nSo nice small card deck.\n\n274\n00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:45.495\nNotice, keep in mind guys, try to stay\noff of the little traces on that card.\n\n275\n00:14:45.495 --> 00:14:52.320\nThe other thing too, is even if you do\nhave your anti-static wrist strap on,\n\n276\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.090\nkeep in mind that the oils in\nyour hands can be very caustic.\n\n277\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.960\nSo you'll leave behind those oils\non those little metal traces.\n\n278\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.570\nAnd they'll just keep\neating through the metal.\n\n279\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.080\nAnybody who's a musician, plays guitar,\n\n280\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.700\nany kind of metal instrument,\nyou've probably seen that before.\n\n281\n00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.750\nIt's one of the reasons you have\nto replace your strings so much.\n\n282\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.550\nTime for some power.\n\n283\n00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.620\nWe're gonna put the power\nsupply in here now.\n\n284\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.120\nWe're not turning it on yet,\nbut at least we'll go ahead and\n\n285\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.370\nput the power supply in.\n\n286\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:21.130\nNow fairly easy on a lot of these cases,\nthey'll have rails.\n\n287\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.893\nAnd this one does have a rail right here.\n\n288\n00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:29.170\nAll right, and\nit lines up fairly easy here.\n\n289\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.230\nYou'll notice right there, all we gotta\ndo here is once it's on that rail,\n\n290\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.270\nit should guide it right into place there.\n\n291\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.640\nNow, the next component that we're going\nto have to or the next thing we're going\n\n292\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.805\nto have to do is we're going to actually\nhave to tighten up the power supply here.\n\n293\n00:15:43.805 --> 00:15:47.711\nSo we'll move this up here and\nshow you what that looks like.\n\n294\n00:15:47.711 --> 00:15:49.721\nSo we have our power supply in now and\n\n295\n00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:53.540\none of the things that we have to make\nsure is that we put some screws in\n\n296\n00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.102\nhere and make sure that the power supply\nisn't a mobile power supply [CROSSTALK].\n\n297\n00:15:58.102 --> 00:15:59.727\nRattling around in your case.\n\n298\n00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:01.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n299\n00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.615\nWell the computer is great but\nthe power supply it took a vacation and\n\n300\n00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:05.911\nit'll be back in a week.\n\n301\n00:16:05.911 --> 00:16:10.260\nSo there we go, pretty easy here guys.\n\n302\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.210\nNoting more than just torquing\ndown this screw here.\n\n303\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.820\nThat's good.\n\n304\n00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.340\nWe've got three of them there.\n\n305\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.838\nWe get those torqued down and the power\nsupply will be in and then we're going to\n\n306\n00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:21.660\ndo a little bit of cable management\nhere routing these cables.\n\n307\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.442\nWe haven't installed all of\nthe cables here in the power supply,\n\n308\n00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:30.070\na modular power supply, which is great\nbecause you only install what you need.\n\n309\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.980\nHowever, we do have to make some\nsense out of these guys, right here.\n\n310\n00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.454\nSo we're gonna do a little bit of routing\nhere and make sure that our CPUs,\n\n311\n00:16:38.454 --> 00:16:42.421\npower supply, and our 24 pin power\nsupply to the mother board or\n\n312\n00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:44.466\npower connection is installed.\n\n313\n00:16:44.466 --> 00:16:49.276\nNow, one of the great things is this case\nallows you to do some pretty good routing.\n\n314\n00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:53.987\nI'm going to go ahead and put that through\nhere and I'm going to twist this around up\n\n315\n00:16:53.987 --> 00:16:58.430\nhere Dan's gonna play us some snake\ncharmer music here in the background, and\n\n316\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.340\nhopefully this thing will work.\n\n317\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.510\nAnd we'll clip that in there,\ngotta be careful with that one.\n\n318\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.880\n>> I forgot my snake charming flute.\n\n319\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.950\n>> That's right, and.\n\n320\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.340\n>> It was mission critical and\nI dropped the ball.\n\n321\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.040\nThat's on me guys, that's on me.\n\n322\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.610\nAnd like Dan mentioned earlier,\nbe careful.\n\n323\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:21.270\nYou don't want to put too much\npressure on the mother board itself.\n\n324\n00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.136\n>> You can put some pressure,\nbut not too much pressure.\n\n325\n00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:24.517\nJust a little bit of pressure.\n\n326\n00:17:24.517 --> 00:17:28.990\n>> So here is our eight pin connector for\nour CPU.\n\n327\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.070\nIt's the next thing we're going to do,\nand this is fairly easy.\n\n328\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.640\nJust clip that it there.\n\n329\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.170\nAnd it's got a keyed locking connector so\nyou should be able to\n\n330\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.380\nfeel that connector kind of slide\nback into place and clip down on it.\n\n331\n00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.130\nSo make sure that those two connectors and\n\n332\n00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.670\nreally all of your\nconnectors are set right.\n\n333\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.280\nAnd there we go.\n\n334\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.020\nSo we've got our power\nrouted to the motherboard.\n\n335\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.840\nWe've got our power routed to the CPU.\n\n336\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.530\nNext thing that we're gonna do,\n\n337\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.990\nwe're gonna do a little bit\nmore power management here.\n\n338\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.020\nNext thing that we have to look\nat connecting are the cables to\n\n339\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.340\nthe front panel.\n\n340\n00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.490\nThese front panel connectors are things\nlike your LED light indicators,\n\n341\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.440\nyour hard drive activity, your reset\nswitch, the power button as well.\n\n342\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.340\nNow as far as how these are arranged,\ncheck the documentation.\n\n343\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.130\nMost of your manufacturers\nare gonna have the documentation.\n\n344\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.010\nAnd I've already gone out to the Intel\nwebsite for this motherboard, and I\n\n345\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.440\nfound the documentation for this, because\nagain, it's not a one size fits all.\n\n346\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.350\nEverybody does this just\na little bit different.\n\n347\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:38.120\nSo let's go ahead and turn this case\naround and see what we're looking at.\n\n348\n00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.340\nSo, the front panel header on\nthe motherboard is right here.\n\n349\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.700\nYou can see this colored pattern here and,\non the documentation,\n\n350\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.060\nit'll tell you exactly how you line it up.\n\n351\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.860\nNow when you follow the documentation\nyou’ll notice that the cables themselves,\n\n352\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.410\nthey have a little bit of writing on them.\n\n353\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.340\nYou can see right there that that’s\nthe reset switch so that if you\n\n354\n00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.760\nbe too need to turn the power off on\nthe motherboard you have that ability.\n\n355\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.670\nNow we’ll go ahead and check our\ndocumentation we’ll get these lined up.\n\n356\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.820\nSo the next thing that we’re gonna\ndo is we’re gonna go ahead and\n\n357\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.470\nwe’re gonna install our optical drive.\n\n358\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.330\nNow it’s fairly easy to do this and\none of the things that with installing\n\n359\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.090\na lot of the drives, is that you don't\nreally need screwdrivers anymore.\n\n360\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.050\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's take a look, here.\n\n361\n00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.190\nNow, on the side of this case,\n\n362\n00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.350\nyou're gonna notice that there\nare these little latches.\n\n363\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.330\nThese little latches are what helps\nit to make it pretty much toolless.\n\n364\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.220\nAnd you gotta open that up, there, and\n\n365\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.690\nit'll allow us to slide that optical\ndrive, hopefully fit right on in.\n\n366\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:40.990\nIts got some rails here and we're hoping\nthat just like that, it lines up.\n\n367\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.490\nAnd then all you have to do, tighten\nthat back down and you're good to go.\n\n368\n00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.850\nThe optical drive, other than\nthe power which we'll get to in a bit.\n\n369\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.810\nIs installed and ready to go.\n\n370\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.080\nNext thing that we have\nto put in is our fans and\n\n371\n00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.550\nwe've got a couple different kinds here.\n\n372\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.350\nWe've got a 240 mm fan and a 40mm fan.\n\n373\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:03.840\nPay attention to the mounting points\nwithin the case too cause you may have\n\n374\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.320\n80mm fans that, again its gonna\nbe specific to the case you have.\n\n375\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.000\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n376\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.730\nWe'll put these screws in here,\nand we can line these up and\n\n377\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.010\nhopefully we will be good to go.\n\n378\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.499\nGot our trusty screwdriver here.\n\n379\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.230\nLong as I don't thread that through\nmy glove, we'll be doing even better.\n\n380\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.710\n>> Yeah, you wanna make sure that when\nyou're tightening any screws down that you\n\n381\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.110\ndon't strip them out.\n\n382\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.110\nSo if they're not seated in just right,\nand you start to thread them down and\n\n383\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.980\nyou notice there's some tension, and\nso you just kind of power through it,\n\n384\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.260\nnot the idea that you wanna do.\n\n385\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.700\nYou wanna make sure they go in nice and\n\n386\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.920\neasily, they should get\ntighter as they sink in.\n\n387\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.220\nBut, if you start off and it's got some\ntension on it, you're probably stripping\n\n388\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.770\nthat thread and you're gonna ruin\nthe screw and the hole that goes through.\n\n389\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.170\nSo, just back it back out,\nmake sure that it's nice and flat and\n\n390\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.620\nseated correctly and\nthen start to screw it in.\n\n391\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.000\nMost of the screws will go in just finger\ntight until you get to a certain depth,\n\n392\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.730\nand then you can use a screwdriver,\nbut, again, don't strip those out.\n\n393\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.200\nThat would be a bad day for your case.\n\n394\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.900\n>> Next thing we have to\ninstall is our hard drive.\n\n395\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.200\nWe need a place to store our data.\n\n396\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.220\nNow, your hard drives should\ncome with these rail, or\n\n397\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.000\nI should say the case should come\nwith these quick release rails,\n\n398\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.080\ndepending on what kind of case you have,\nit could vary just a little bit.\n\n399\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:30.760\nNow, once you've got your rails on, it's\njust a matter of sliding the drive in.\n\n400\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.826\nNext thing we have to do is\ngrab our data cable here.\n\n401\n00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:37.009\nSo pay attention to the serial\nATA cable that you have and\n\n402\n00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:38.644\nthe length of the cable too.\n\n403\n00:21:38.644 --> 00:21:42.696\nSo sometimes the cables can be\na little difficult to route.\n\n404\n00:21:42.696 --> 00:21:46.038\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ninstall the data cable.\n\n405\n00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:49.115\nAnd you'll see we have our SATA\nports down here on the bottom.\n\n406\n00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:54.189\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ntorque that down there.\n\n407\n00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.189\nThis is a good thing because these are.\n\n408\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.430\nFairly easy to install.\n\n409\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.460\nAnd now we've got our\nhard drive ready to go.\n\n410\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.150\nTime to the brains of\nthe operations into this case.\n\n411\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.830\nAnd let's see if we can do that\nwithout destroying it here.\n\n412\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.860\nYou gotta be very,\nvery careful with these processors.\n\n413\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.470\nI don't want to touch any\nof the electrical contacts.\n\n414\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.020\nThere's little triangle.\n\n415\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.320\nI know it's difficult to see there.\n\n416\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.328\nAnd that lets us know to line this up.\n\n417\n00:22:20.328 --> 00:22:25.680\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nopen up this LGA socket here, and\n\n418\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.860\nwe are going to try to pull the pins\nback here, it's kind of hard to do.\n\n419\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.960\n>> I would say this is probably one\nof the times where my caveat of,\n\n420\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.220\ndon't worry about giving it a little\nbit of pressure does not apply.\n\n421\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.360\nThis is where you do want to worry\nabout giving it a little pressure.\n\n422\n00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.290\n>> Yeah.\n>> The CPUs are very fragile.\n\n423\n00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.458\nYou don't want them to break.\n\n424\n00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:49.250\nBecause A, they're one of the most\nexpensive components inside of your PC and\n\n425\n00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.180\nB, well you don't want to have to pay for\nit.\n\n426\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.920\n>> No you definitely don't.\n\n427\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.025\nNow what the LGA sockets,\nthey're relatively easy to install.\n\n428\n00:22:58.025 --> 00:23:01.485\nAgain, there is a triangle mark there so\nbe careful.\n\n429\n00:23:01.485 --> 00:23:06.225\nMake sure that you definitely install\nthese in the right direction here.\n\n430\n00:23:06.225 --> 00:23:11.290\nAnd then it's just as simple\nas pushing that cover down.\n\n431\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.670\nAnd we’re gonna try to lock this in place.\n\n432\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.828\nLet me just double check and\nmake sure that everything is lined up.\n\n433\n00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:21.470\nAnd there we go.\n\n434\n00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.500\nWe’ll try to push this lever down.\n\n435\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.270\nAnd our CPU should be installed.\n\n436\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.700\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nput some thermal compound on it.\n\n437\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.530\nWe're gonna hook up\nthe water cooler as well.\n\n438\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.090\nFirst part of installing the liquid\ncooling system is making sure\n\n439\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.160\nthat the rear fan here\nis installed properly.\n\n440\n00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.620\nAnd you also have to pay attention too,\n\n441\n00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.270\non where this CPU fan is going to plug\nin to the mother board back here.\n\n442\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:54.526\nSo, we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe'll throw that in there.\n\n443\n00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:59.540\nAnd this can be a little tricky\nhere because you actually\n\n444\n00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.980\nhave to thread the screws through,\nnot only the Fan itself,\n\n445\n00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.438\nbut also into the radiator\nto hold the radiator on.\n\n446\n00:24:10.438 --> 00:24:16.382\nOnce we get one in there and\nget the other one in here, too.\n\n447\n00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:20.425\nHopefully.\n\n448\n00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:22.063\nThat's the goal, at least.\n\n449\n00:24:29.682 --> 00:24:31.030\nThere we go.\n\n450\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.070\n>> We have full confidence\nin your threading abilities.\n\n451\n00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.900\n>> I hope so.\n\n452\n00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.472\nI hope so.\n\n453\n00:24:35.472 --> 00:24:39.736\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n454\n00:24:39.736 --> 00:24:44.860\nnow that we've got those set,\ntry to hold those in place here.\n\n455\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.150\nAnd, the next thing that we've got\nto do is get this radiator in.\n\n456\n00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.430\nAnd with the radiator,\nwe'll just be careful with this thing.\n\n457\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.730\nDan, you think you might be\nable to hold that right there?\n\n458\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:55.640\nPerfect.\n\n459\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.430\nWe certainly don't want\nany parts just kind of\n\n460\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.880\nbouncing around down there\nin the bottom of the case.\n\n461\n00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.318\nLike I said, this one's gonna be a little\nbit tricky if I can get that first one\n\n462\n00:25:05.318 --> 00:25:07.656\nstarted it's all downhill from there.\n\n463\n00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:14.527\nWe will get that one threaded in.\n\n464\n00:25:14.527 --> 00:25:18.300\nAnd we'll get the rest\nof these threaded in and\n\n465\n00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.830\nthe next thing we'll do is install\nthe water block on top of the CPU.\n\n466\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.370\nWhen you install the CPU, it's important\nto make sure that the surface of\n\n467\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.845\nthe CPU is clean and\nwe do have a little compound.\n\n468\n00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:36.330\nAnd it's I guess, not a compound,\na little solution here that will make\n\n469\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.795\nsure that the surface of the CPU and\nthe thermal compound work together.\n\n470\n00:25:40.795 --> 00:25:43.650\nAnd you get a better cooling out of it.\n\n471\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:50.080\nSo when you put your thermal compound\non the CPU be careful because you\n\n472\n00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.370\ndon't really need that much they typically\nsay a rice sized dot will do you.\n\n473\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.480\nAnd you only have to put a little\nbit right in the middle of the CPU.\n\n474\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.360\nNow, you'll hear people that\nwill differ on this next port.\n\n475\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.775\nSome of them will say that go ahead and\nspread the thermal compound.\n\n476\n00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:11.925\nIf you go up to Intel's website, which\nis where I got the specifications for\n\n477\n00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:13.035\nthis motherboard.\n\n478\n00:26:13.035 --> 00:26:18.015\nIntel on this board, doesn't recommend\ndoing that, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n479\n00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:21.059\nlet's get this water cooler on here,\nthe block.\n\n480\n00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:28.553\nAnd those screws that we tightened down in\nthe first part here when we were putting\n\n481\n00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:34.450\nthe motherboard on, that's where they're\ngonna come into place for us now.\n\n482\n00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.870\nAll right, and we're going to go ahead and\nwe're gonna install those.\n\n483\n00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.550\nOne of the last things that we're going to\ndo before we put our case back together is\n\n484\n00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.560\nwe're gonna route some\nof these power cables.\n\n485\n00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:52.045\nNow pay attention to the markings on\nthe cable, most of them are marked there.\n\n486\n00:26:52.045 --> 00:26:55.190\nAnd for instance, this first one's\ngonna go to our hard drives.\n\n487\n00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:59.860\nIt's gonna go from the edge, or the back\nof the power supply, and we're gonna route\n\n488\n00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.920\nit over here to this hard drive, and\nup towards the optical drive right here.\n\n489\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.890\nWe have another one that looks\nreally close to the same thing.\n\n490\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.670\nSo again just pay attention\nto the markings on the cable.\n\n491\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.520\nNow this one is going to power\nthis massive graphics card that we\n\n492\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.190\nhave back here.\n\n493\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.520\nAnd we're gonna go from the back of the\npower supply here, and then we're gonna\n\n494\n00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.080\nroute this right to the back of that card\nand power the PCI video adapter here.\n\n495\n00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.350\nOne of the last things that we have\nto do is put the front of the case\n\n496\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.280\nback together.\n\n497\n00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.440\nSo let's go ahead, and we'll move\nthis around just a little bit here.\n\n498\n00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.370\nAnd with this, you'll see that the,\n\n499\n00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:45.000\nthey have these pressure points here that\nyou can, should just clip right back on.\n\n500\n00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.410\nI went ahead and took this plate off\ncuz it makes it a little bit easier.\n\n501\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.965\nAnd we'll line these up with the inside.\n\n502\n00:27:57.223 --> 00:27:59.760\nJust make sure that those\nare all lined up good.\n\n503\n00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.970\nAnd then we can put the faceplate back on,\nthe blank plate.\n\n504\n00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.860\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n505\n00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.840\nWe've got a few of these\nAllen bolts I guess.\n\n506\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.640\nA Allen wrench here\nwill snug them back up.\n\n507\n00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.530\nWe’re gonna take one more\nlook through everything.\n\n508\n00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.820\nWe’re gonna make sure that\nour routing is good and\n\n509\n00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.620\nall the components are seated well.\n\n510\n00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.110\nAnd we should be good to start this thing\nup and put an operating system on it.\n\n511\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.110\n>> Yeah I cannot wait for that.\n\n512\n00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.340\nIt’s gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n513\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.840\nWes we’ve gone through\nquite a bit of stuff today.\n\n514\n00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.310\nWe installed the motherboard.\n\n515\n00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.140\nWe put the hard drives in,\nwe put the RAM in.\n\n516\n00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.600\nWe put the CPU cooling systems.\n\n517\n00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.440\nWow, it was a lot of work, but\nnow we have our own custom PC.\n\n518\n00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.880\nLike Wes said, all we gotta do now is\nthrow an operating system on that guy and\n\n519\n00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.120\nwe should have a screaming\ndemon here in front of us,\n\n520\n00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.270\nwe do have quite a BP system here.\n\n521\n00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.130\nThanks, Wes, for showing us how\nto put all these things together,\n\n522\n00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.080\nhopefully if you were following\nalong now you've figured out how to\n\n523\n00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.450\nget some of the components that\nyou're working with into your PC.\n\n524\n00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.510\nHopefully you got a nice one like we do.\n\n525\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:05.350\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for this\nepisode, for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n526\n00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.080\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n527\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.920\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n528\n00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.610\n>> And we'll

to\nanother great episode of ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:21.194\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, joining me\nin the studio today is my good friend and\n\n5\n00:00:21.194 --> 00:00:23.131\nthe master of PCs is Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.160\nHow are you doing today, Wes?\n\n7\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.990\n>> Oh man, I'm doing good, and\nit's great to be here today.\n\n8\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.800\nWe're moving along in our PC build,\nwe've got our machine put together.\n\n9\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.450\nIf you haven't seen those episodes,\ndefinitely check them out.\n\n10\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.760\nToday, it's gonna be about hopefully,\nthe hardware is where we want it to be.\n\n11\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.560\nAnd one of the things that we have to\ndo to make sure that our hardware is\n\n12\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.060\nrecognized, and we're not having any\nissues is with a technology called BIOS.\n\n13\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.920\nSo in this episode we're gonna talk\nabout BIOS configurations, and\n\n14\n00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.580\nlet's go ahead and\njust real briefly talk about what BIOS is.\n\n15\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.150\nRemember every PC is going to have\nsome kind of input/output system,\n\n16\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.925\nfirmware platform if you will,\nthat's going to bring our devices online,\n\n17\n00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:06.170\ngonna make sure that they're there,\nsend a little electrical signals, and\n\n18\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.690\nhopefully it gets a response back.\n\n19\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.420\nSo basically bringing that\nhardware online and stabilizing so\n\n20\n00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.780\nthat the operating system doesn't have to,\nand it makes it a lot easier for us today.\n\n21\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.870\n>> Yes.\nThe BIOS is one of the systems that\n\n22\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.923\nyou've gotta learn about,\nthe good old basic input/output system.\n\n23\n00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:29.050\nIt's the kickstarter, right,\nthe subprimal brain of the computer.\n\n24\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.730\nIt's where everything gets going, so we\ngot to know a little bit about it because\n\n25\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.960\nit does deal with our hardware, right, it\nmakes sure all those things are working.\n\n26\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.800\nPlus you have a few other settings in\nthere as well, that will be important for\n\n27\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.100\nyou when you're setting up a computer\nmaybe in your environment.\n\n28\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.010\nNow Wes, there is a lot of options,\n\n29\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.170\na lot of configuration stuff\ninside of the BIOS systems.\n\n30\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.000\nWhere the heck do we even begin?\n\n31\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.660\n>> Well, very good.\n\n32\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.520\nWell, one of the things that you're gonna\ndo first, is you're gonna pay attention to\n\n33\n00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.470\nthe specifics within whatever\nfirmware platform you have in the PC.\n\n34\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.570\nWell, when you first start the machine,\none of the things that you will notice is\n\n35\n00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.600\nthat you have to press\na certain function key.\n\n36\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.420\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and do here\nis we're gonna go ahead and we're going to\n\n37\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.133\nrestart our machine, and we're gonna\nshow you exactly how to boot into BIOS.\n\n38\n00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:18.390\nSo, right now our machine is rebooting and\nagain, pay attention to whatever\n\n39\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.090\nthe manufacturer's, not recommendations,\nI guess it's not a recommendation.\n\n40\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.820\nIt's gonna be what you have to push\nin order to boot into the BIOS.\n\n41\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.006\nNow, this one right here,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n42\n00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.835\nboot it into it via the F2\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n43\n00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:37.305\nSome of them I've seen are Escape,\nsome of them I've seen are also Delete.\n\n44\n00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:39.255\nI know the one on my machine\nat the house is Delete.\n\n45\n00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:40.890\nSo just pay attention to whatever.\n\n46\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.740\nYou can easily see it on\nthe Splash screen pretty quick.\n\n47\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.240\nNow one of the first screens\nthat we talk about and\n\n48\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.650\nreally need to look at, is that\nthe main screen as they call it here.\n\n49\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.460\nSo it's the main deal, right?\n\n50\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.305\nThis is Main Street.\n\n51\n00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:56.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now Wes, is this ubiquitous?\n\n52\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.224\nIs this the same kind of screen I'll\nsee regardless of the BIOS system or\n\n53\n00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:03.730\nare they different with\nthe same kind of concepts?\n\n54\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.380\n>> The concepts are going to be identical.\n\n55\n00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.151\nI will tell you though, the interfaces,\nthey can differ just a little bit, so\n\n56\n00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:13.283\nagain, pay attention to the BIOS revision\nthat you have, and we're gonna show you.\n\n57\n00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:17.837\nYou can see right up here at the top, this\nlittle grayed out bar here at the top,\n\n58\n00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:19.850\ntells us what our BIOS version is.\n\n59\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.620\nNow you can see that crazy\nslew of numbers and letters,\n\n60\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.150\nalphanumeric characters there.\n\n61\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.870\nOne of the things that you're gonna\nwanna do is go ahead and check it out.\n\n62\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.670\nYou can do a Google search out there.\n\n63\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.990\nOne of the best things to do honestly,\nis just go straight to the vendor.\n\n64\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.550\nWhen it comes to BIOS, you really\ndon't want to go through any third\n\n65\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.110\nparties because you wanna make\nsure that your BIOS is consistent.\n\n66\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.490\nSo one of the first things we do\nis we identify the current BIOS.\n\n67\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.920\nSo in some of the other episodes\nthat we have talked about,\n\n68\n00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.710\nwe were under a budget build.\n\n69\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.160\nOne of the things with a budget build\nis you might not have the latest and\n\n70\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.800\ngreatest, right?\n\n71\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.168\nIf you had the latest and greatest,\nit probably wouldn't be a budget,\n\n72\n00:03:57.168 --> 00:03:58.641\nit'd be well over the budget.\n\n73\n00:03:58.641 --> 00:04:01.904\nSo most likely you'll have\nto do a firmware update,\n\n74\n00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:06.798\nso that's why this number right here,\nvery, very important to check it out,\n\n75\n00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:10.820\nto make sure that you have\nthe most current BIOS revision.\n\n76\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.550\nRemember when you update a BIOS after\ninstalling the hardware, a lot of times,\n\n77\n00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.060\nnot only does it give you full\nsystem functionality, but\n\n78\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.960\nit could give you additional options too.\n\n79\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.490\nSo the BIOS revision's very,\nvery important here.\n\n80\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.500\n>> Yeah, I don't wanna let them get too\nfar behind, cuz we wanna take advantage of\n\n81\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.980\nall the cool features that they're adding\nto those systems, and making sure that\n\n82\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.110\nthey are compatible with anything new\nthat we add into the computer as well.\n\n83\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.250\nSo Wes is exactly right on that.\n\n84\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.200\nMake sure that anytime\na new reversion comes out,\n\n85\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.440\ncheck it for maybe some compatibility\nissues, maybe some new features, and\n\n86\n00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.360\nif need be, go ahead and install that.\n\n87\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.040\nNow, I do notice sometimes people\ndon't always add them in because\n\n88\n00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.830\nthey don't need it, or\nthey don't expect they need it.\n\n89\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.283\nBut if you ever do add some hardware, and\nit's not being supported by the BIOS,\n\n90\n00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:58.690\nit's not seeing it, well then you\nknow you gotta go grab that firmware.\n\n91\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.870\n>> Yeah, and\nlet's make sure we also establish,\n\n92\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.370\nif you do have to do a BIOS update,\nbe careful.\n\n93\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.410\nYou never want to a BIOS update when\nthere an electrical storm out and\n\n94\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.400\nmore importantly,\nwhen you have a potential for power loss.\n\n95\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.020\nYou can permanently ruin a machine\nif you ruin its firmware platform,\n\n96\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.120\nand you get any corruption in there,\nit's a bad day at the office.\n\n97\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870\nNow, the next thing that we have\nup here on the main screen,\n\n98\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.640\nyou'll see is the processor type, and\nthe processor type's gonna be important.\n\n99\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.380\nWe have a Xeon Processor here.\n\n100\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.533\nIt's a W3250, and it tells me\nexactly what the frequency is here.\n\n101\n00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.681\nWe can see 2.67 gigahertz.\n\n102\n00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:39.140\nYou can also see the architecture.\n\n103\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.540\nNow, why is architecture important?\n\n104\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.640\nBecause after we've done\nour BIOS configuration,\n\n105\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.480\nwe're gonna have to load\nan operating system.\n\n106\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.840\nAnd if we have a 64-bit BIOS here, and\nwe load a 32-bit operating system, well,\n\n107\n00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.920\nwe're not gonna be able to take advantage\nof the full power of this machine,\n\n108\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.520\nspecifically due to the memory limitation.\n\n109\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.000\nNow we also have active cores here, and\nif you have a multi-core processor,\n\n110\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.530\nyou can make some changes.\n\n111\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.010\nYou can tell the BIOS, hey,\nmaybe I don't want to use all the cores.\n\n112\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.976\nNow, personally, if I've got more cores,\nI don't want to turn it off, right?\n\n113\n00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:13.471\nI don't want to get the 350\nbored out engine, and\n\n114\n00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:16.740\nthen revert it back to\nless than a four cylinder.\n\n115\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.500\nSo it really, really doesn't make much\nsense on there, so you can do that.\n\n116\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.530\nBut I would just recommend,\nif you've got the cores here, use them.\n\n117\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.390\nNow, the other thing we have here\nis a Hyper-Threading Technology.\n\n118\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.130\nNow, you won't see this, speaking\nabout specifics with manufacturers,\n\n119\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.020\nyou're not gonna see\nthis on the AMD board.\n\n120\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.540\nSo this won't be available.\n\n121\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.140\nIt's a multithreading technology and\nreally in PC, Intel is the only\n\n122\n00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.720\none supporting it, and again you can turn\nit off [LAUGH] or you can enable it.\n\n123\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.955\nI'm gonna leave it enabled because, again\nit's more performance here if we turn off\n\n124\n00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:55.590\nHyper-Threading, we don't get the ability\nto have extra software-based cores, and\n\n125\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.410\nyou can really just\nhinder your performance.\n\n126\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.440\nOne of the things that we also have here,\nwe talk about, well, language.\n\n127\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.570\nTalk about the language, well, that's\ngoing to be specific to your motherboard.\n\n128\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.720\nI've always wondered, well, are there\ngoing to be other languages in here?\n\n129\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.136\nNope.\n\n130\n00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:11.800\n[LAUGH] That's all you get.\n\n131\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.480\nSo, I know not everybody out there's\nobviously going to be speaking English, so\n\n132\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.640\nit's going to be something,\nwherever you bought the product from,\n\n133\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.070\nmost likely it'll have whatever\nthe native language is there, too.\n\n134\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.770\nAll right, now you might notice some\nthings across this motherboard.\n\n135\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.322\nWhat do you notice off the, or\nI say motherboard, the BIOS screen.\n\n136\n00:07:30.322 --> 00:07:33.780\nDan, what do you notice up here\nbetween some of this lettering?\n\n137\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.120\n>> Yeah, it was funny,\nwe were talking about this earlier.\n\n138\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.005\nAnd the first thing we noticed was some\nof the options are obviously white, and\n\n139\n00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:42.420\nsome of them are gray.\n\n140\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.621\nAnd now usually grayed-out means you can't\ntouch them, you can't do anything to them.\n\n141\n00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:51.305\nThey are set in stone kind of thing, it is\nmore informational, whereas the white ones\n\n142\n00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.983\nseem to be Where you can go into and\nstart configuring things.\n\n143\n00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:55.933\n>> Yeah, well it just shows you,\neven in computing here,\n\n144\n00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:57.310\nnot everything can be black and white.\n\n145\n00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.660\nWe always have to have shades of gray.\n\n146\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.990\nI can think of an old\nBiohazard song coming on here.\n\n147\n00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.530\nWell, the gray is\nbasically just information.\n\n148\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.030\nIt's information,\na lot of times you can't set it.\n\n149\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.130\nNow this is gonna get kinda confusing,\ncuz there's one in here,\n\n150\n00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.520\nyou'll see things like memory speed,\nit's grayed out.\n\n151\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.360\nAnd, well, I said you can't change it,\nwell, that's not really the case.\n\n152\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.300\nYou have to unlock it to\nbe able to change it.\n\n153\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.280\nSo when you see something that's grayed\nout, it's really for information purposes\n\n154\n00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.200\nonly and you're not really going to\nbe able to make a difference on it or\n\n155\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.210\nI should change it and configure it.\n\n156\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.890\nNow, we've got also some system\nidentification information too.\n\n157\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.770\nThis is where you can have\nthings like your MAC address for\n\n158\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.010\nyour network adapters,\nwhat the company is.\n\n159\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.370\nAnd we really can see the company\nhere at the top, right,\n\n160\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.050\nit says it's an Intel board.\n\n161\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.460\nYou go with Intel,\nyou're going to go with an Intel board, so\n\n162\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.050\nyou can see that system\ninformation there as well.\n\n163\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.410\nNext thing that we can figure\nis the system date and time.\n\n164\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.640\nAnd you can see that here at the bottom.\n\n165\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.170\nWe have the date and\nwe can set that there.\n\n166\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.410\nNot too specific, right?\n\n167\n00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.090\nWe also have the system time\nthat we can set here as well.\n\n168\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.680\n>> That's right.\n\n169\n00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.080\nNow, what's an interesting thing about\nhaving the system date and time, and\n\n170\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.980\nyou're like, huh Well, it's nice to\nbe able to know what date it is and\n\n171\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.010\nwhat time it is.\n\n172\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.950\nI'm logged in my bios here.\n\n173\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.957\nAnd maybe I'm,\nwell what was todays date again?\n\n174\n00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:14.070\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Where was my watch?\n\n175\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.765\n>> But,\nit actually is kind of an important thing.\n\n176\n00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:17.348\nRight, Wes?\n\n177\n00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.565\n>> It is.\nYou know, all of your synchronization,\n\n178\n00:09:19.565 --> 00:09:22.590\nwhen we think about all of\nthe electrical currents running across\n\n179\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.920\nthe the motherboard.\n\n180\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.630\nWe think about network communications,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.090\nWell, everything can be\ntypically synchronized, right.\n\n182\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:34.050\nYou have something in your computer\ncalled that system clock, right, and\n\n183\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.230\nDan, I know you play guitar.\n\n184\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.740\nI like music as well.\n\n185\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.560\nIt's like a metronome, right,\nit sets the heartbeat.\n\n186\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.040\nFor every single interaction\ngoing across the mother board.\n\n187\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.280\nSo at a basic level,\nif we talk hardware level,\n\n188\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.050\nagain it really sets the pace for\nour communications.\n\n189\n00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.730\nThe other thing you have to know is that\nsoftware level, if we talk about for\n\n190\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.500\ninstance being in a Windows domain.\n\n191\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.220\nIf you join this computer to a corporate\nnetwork it uses something known as\n\n192\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.280\nthe Kerberos Authentication Protocol, and\nthere can't be any variations between\n\n193\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.690\nthe system time and\nthe time within that corporate network.\n\n194\n00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.890\nSo that could cause problems there too.\n\n195\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.710\nSo if your time isn't set right,\n\n196\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.950\nit's not just a matter of saying,\noh, well it's about 3 o'clock here.\n\n197\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.020\nYou need to make sure that\nthe system time is right.\n\n198\n00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.320\nIt is important.\n\n199\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.670\nIf you do go with a refurbished board,\nand you boot into your bios and\n\n200\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.170\nyou set your time, and you restart the\ncomputer, and you come back in here and\n\n201\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:39.140\nthe time still says 2004, check your\ncmos battery that is a tell tell sign\n\n202\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.700\nthat maybe whomever you bought it from,\nmaybe they didn't spend even three bucks\n\n203\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.490\non that little three volt battery to\nkeep this time, so very important.\n\n204\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.690\nIt's one of the tell tell signs too that\nyou need to replace your CMOS battery.\n\n205\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.110\n>> Yeah I've actually had to use this\n\n206\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.360\nparticular function right here to get\npeople back into their computers.\n\n207\n00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.270\nYou would think how the heck do\nyou use the time to get people\n\n208\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.450\ninto their computers.\n\n209\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.320\nHow is it locking them\nout of the computers?\n\n210\n00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.450\nLike what Wes said, if those times on\nthe Kerberos authentication protocol isn't\n\n211\n00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.460\nworking, in a Windows domain?\n\n212\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.060\nWell, people aren't gonna log in, it's\ngonna say that the time is too far off\n\n213\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.360\nfrom the time that the network is looking\nat and it's not gonna allow you to login.\n\n214\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.290\nWell, if they are a domain user,\n\n215\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.550\nthey probably don't have\na local login to the machine.\n\n216\n00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.880\nAnd if you've disabled all\nthe administrative local logins\n\n217\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.740\nhow are they suppose to log in?\n\n218\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.910\nWell, you can change the time, you can\njump down into the log, into the BIOS.\n\n219\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.430\nRestart the computer,\njump into that BIOS screen and\n\n220\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.690\nchange the time to the current date and\ntime.\n\n221\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.330\nOnce that's fixed, it fixes it for\nthe entire system, and now it will\n\n222\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.270\nline up with that Kerberos authentication,\nand they'll be able to log in.\n\n223\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.920\nSo you think something, oh, it's just so\nminute, it's just the date and time!\n\n224\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.650\nIt can really have an effect on\nthe system itself, and you can even use\n\n225\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.330\nit to affect the system in a positive way,\nmaybe even troubleshoot a problem.\n\n226\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.150\n>> Yeah, and then not to get off\non a tangent on security, but\n\n227\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.620\neven if you're using things like IPsec\ncommunication it works very, anything that\n\n228\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.390\nworks on timestamping is gonna either\n>> Succeed or fail all based on the system\n\n229\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.720\ntime, so it's very, very important,\nvery important, yeah.\n\n230\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.170\n>> All right, well Wes,\nwhere do we go to next?\n\n231\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.610\n>> Well, you know, next thing that we're\ngonna do is look at some configuration\n\n232\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.210\nof the components that are on\nthe motherboard itself.\n\n233\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.140\nSo the next category we're\ngonna get in here, go to,\n\n234\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.910\nif I can say that right, is configuration.\n\n235\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.110\nNow the configuration section here,\nI don't want to say tab,\n\n236\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.390\nthere aren't really any tabs here,\nis gonna be where we can configure\n\n237\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.660\nsome of the devices that\nare connected to the motherboard,\n\n238\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.670\nand even some of the devices that\nare built into the motherboard.\n\n239\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.850\nYou say, wait a second, I've got a device?\n\n240\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.990\nBuilt into the motherboard well we've\ngot this thing called the chipset.\n\n241\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.900\nAnd based on your different motherboard\nthat you installed the chipset is really\n\n242\n00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.060\nan amazing thing it can\npotentially do a lot of things.\n\n243\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.160\nSo let's look at some of\nthe things that we can do here.\n\n244\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.820\nOne of the first things that we can\ndo is if you want to set up infrared,\n\n245\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.536\nI don't know anybody that's\ngoing to use infrared.\n\n246\n00:12:56.536 --> 00:12:59.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least not in a computer anymore,\n\n247\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.090\nbut, I could turn on\nthe infrared if I wanted audio.\n\n248\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:07.250\nI also have the ability to\nturn the onboard audio, and\n\n249\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:13.780\nwhat that means for us is that, Intel's\nICH, that integrated controller hub.\n\n250\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.110\nWhat it can do is, it can perform\nthe same functionality as a sound card.\n\n251\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.750\nSo if I am using on board sound here,\nwell, guess what?\n\n252\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.730\nI can enable it.\n\n253\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:29.600\nIf I have a sound card installed, a lot\nof times you might have to come in here,\n\n254\n00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.870\nyou might have to disable it, and tell\nthe VIOS, no that's okay, we got this.\n\n255\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.940\nWe don't need you.\n\n256\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.200\nYou can go ahead and turn that off.\n\n257\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.480\nAnd we also have a network adapter here.\n\n258\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.390\nNow the network adapter\nyou can see on board LAN.\n\n259\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.660\nThat's all it is, the LAN,\nlocal area network.\n\n260\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.980\nThis is the network adapter that's\nbuilt into the motherboard, and\n\n261\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.610\nyou can see that it's enabled right now.\n\n262\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.160\n>> That's right.\nNow when we did our build on this machine,\n\n263\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.330\nwe actually installed an add-in nick.\n\n264\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.220\nWe wanted to use that,\nmaybe it's faster than the onboard one.\n\n265\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.710\nSo we went in and said, you know what?\n\n266\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.900\nLet's go with that gigabit network card,\nsomething to that effect.\n\n267\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.720\nNow Wes,\ncan we use both at the same time, or\n\n268\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.825\nare we stuck with With one or the other.\n\n269\n00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:10.545\n>> Yeah, it can cause some havocs and\n\n270\n00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:14.095\na lot of times,\nthe boards aren't gonna support it.\n\n271\n00:14:14.095 --> 00:14:16.205\nNow, give you a comparison.\n\n272\n00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:19.515\nI've got a board at the house\nthat's got a two integrated NIX for\n\n273\n00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:21.705\nthings like LAN teaming,\nif you're a gamer and\n\n274\n00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:24.530\nwanna double your speeds\non your internal network.\n\n275\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.370\nThat works fine.\n\n276\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.160\nIt's two on-board necks.\n\n277\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.050\nBut typically with an adaptor slot based\nnetwork adaptor and one that's on board,\n\n278\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.910\nthey're gonna conflict here.\n\n279\n00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.980\nSo let's go ahead and\ndisable that because like Dan said,\n\n280\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.880\nwe've got a pretty good network adaptor.\n\n281\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.730\nWe dropped it in that 16-lane PCIE slot,\n\n282\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.200\nso we can really get some\nperformance out of that.\n\n283\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.850\nFreeing up some of the performance\nthat could be used or\n\n284\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.340\nutilized elsewhere across the motherboard,\nhere.\n\n285\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.045\nSo we'll go ahead and make sure I\ndon't disable the sound card, here.\n\n286\n00:14:52.045 --> 00:14:56.520\n[LAUGH] And now you can see, I've got\nthe ability to enable or disable it.\n\n287\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.390\nAnd we'll go ahead and disable it now.\n\n288\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.920\n>> How are you getting into\nthose subdirectors to.\n\n289\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.280\n>> That's a.\n>> Enable or disable.\n\n290\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.040\n>> That's a good question.\n\n291\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.520\nLet's go ahead and establish that.\n\n292\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.240\nWhen I go into a section, I'm actually\nlooking for the highlighted area and\n\n293\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.570\nI'm pressing enter.\n\n294\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.005\nNow the other thing too is\ngetting outta that section.\n\n295\n00:15:14.005 --> 00:15:15.535\nAnd I probably should mention that.\n\n296\n00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:16.855\nNotice I was just in here.\n\n297\n00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:18.305\nNow that's an enter.\n\n298\n00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:22.765\nAnd then once I've set the values\nthrough the arrow keys, and again pay\n\n299\n00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:26.565\nattention to your mother board, because\nyou might be pushing the space key.\n\n300\n00:15:26.565 --> 00:15:27.855\nIt might be the tab key.\n\n301\n00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:29.240\nOn this one it's pretty easy.\n\n302\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.240\nIt's just the Enter key and then\nthe Escape key after you set the value.\n\n303\n00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.660\nWe'll get back to that area\nthat you were working in.\n\n304\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.870\nYou've gotta be careful though,\n\n305\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.300\nbecause if you hit Escape twice,\nnotice what's gonna happen.\n\n306\n00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.290\nIts gonna ask me,\ndo I wanna discard the changes?\n\n307\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.414\nAnd we're not there yet so\nI certainly don't want to do that.\n\n308\n00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:52.198\nAnd I'm just doing escape and enter and\nthen the up and down keys, arrows.\n\n309\n00:15:52.198 --> 00:15:56.400\n>> Yeah, I've seen some Dell motherboards,\ntheir will use the.\n\n310\n00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.199\nU and D for up and down.\n\n311\n00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:00.382\nSome of them use plus and minus.\n\n312\n00:16:00.382 --> 00:16:04.950\nSo you've just got to kind of check\nyour BIOS around, take a look around.\n\n313\n00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.300\nUsually, just something that's easy,\nthough, is just use the enter, and\n\n314\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.530\nthe up and down key.\n\n315\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.768\nOther than than that,\nthey should be pretty descriptive.\n\n316\n00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:14.450\n>> Yeah, and\nnotice one thing that happened.\n\n317\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.900\nThe moment Dan had me turn off that NIC,\n\n318\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.680\nthat network adapter,\nif you look down there in the bottom,\n\n319\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.300\nit's letting me know in yellow and\nthat's not always the case with the BIOS.\n\n320\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.210\nIt's letting me know down\nthere at the bottom, hey,\n\n321\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.720\nyou've got changes that you've\ncommitted to this BIOS.\n\n322\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.180\nDo you want to commit\nthem to the ROM onboard?\n\n323\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.950\nAnd that's something that you're going\nto have to remember is that sometimes we\n\n324\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.050\ncome in here.\n\n325\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.860\nLike we did here, in fact,\nlet's go back to that first screen.\n\n326\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.800\nSometimes I'm just looking to see what\nthe memory is inside of the board.\n\n327\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.580\nAnd I can see here down at\nthe bottom that channel A, B, and C,\n\n328\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.620\nall four slots are populated.\n\n329\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.400\nThat might be all I wanna do, right?\n\n330\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.200\nI might not wanna have\nto get down there and\n\n331\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.070\npull the case open and\ncount each RAM module.\n\n332\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:55.990\nI can see it right here.\n\n333\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.980\nI'm not gonna make a change.\n\n334\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.730\nSo I don't have that little\nwarning button there.\n\n335\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:05.090\nSo definitely pay attention to that on\nyour machine if you have made changes.\n\n336\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.470\nSometimes it'll let you know but\n\n337\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.180\nother times it won't let you\nknow until you go to escape.\n\n338\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.970\nSo just be careful with that because you\ndon't want to make all of your changes,\n\n339\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.550\nwhich you can get into making a lot of\nconfigurations and really tuning this\n\n340\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.020\nboard, and if you exit and discard them,\nwell now you've rebooted them.\n\n341\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.210\nIt's dumped the changes out and\nnow you've gotta start over so\n\n342\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.590\nyou've got to be careful with that one.\n\n343\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.670\nAll right so we've got some\nother onboard devices here too.\n\n344\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:34.005\nYou're probably familiar if not,\nthen good thing you're here with us.\n\n345\n00:17:34.005 --> 00:17:37.560\nIEEE 1394 guys,\nthis is just fancy jargon here,\n\n346\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.857\nthis is the technical standard for what\nwe commonly call FireWire in a machine.\n\n347\n00:17:42.857 --> 00:17:48.940\nSo if your board supports an onboard\nFireWire port what you're telling the BIOS\n\n348\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.320\nis I'm gonna use the motherboard's port,\nI'm not gonna use a card.\n\n349\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.970\nNow again if you have a card you\nmight want to disable it and\n\n350\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.140\nit's just as easy as getting in\nhere the same thing on or off.\n\n351\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.060\nLight switch on, gonna work on the mother\nboard, light switch off it's going to say\n\n352\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:11.130\nkick that out to the expansion slot and\nlet the expansion slot take care of it.\n\n353\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.010\nNow here's another one\nthat's very important.\n\n354\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.320\nThis is the USB configuration, and\nwe'll go ahead and get into here.\n\n355\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.470\nWith the USB configuration\nyou've got a couple of options.\n\n356\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.323\nDo you wanna turn these\nports on in the back plane?\n\n357\n00:18:22.323 --> 00:18:25.710\nOr, do you,\nin the little IO panel in the back.\n\n358\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.660\nOr do you wanna disable them?\n\n359\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.280\nThere's really no reason to disable them.\n\n360\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.580\nMaybe if you have legacy ports.\n\n361\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.810\nAnd what I mean by that is maybe\nyou've done like we've done and\n\n362\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.710\nyou've installed a USB 3.0 card.\n\n363\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.560\nSo you get the more current speeds.\n\n364\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.680\nWell, you might have to disable it.\n\n365\n00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.300\nWe don't have to do that here,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n366\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.790\nThere's a legacy option too.\n\n367\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.600\nNotice it says legacy option,\nenable or disable.\n\n368\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.102\nNow, the legacy option,\nnow we're gonna take a trip back in time.\n\n369\n00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:58.510\n[LAUGH] 88.5 miles per hour.\n\n370\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:05.150\nAnd if you want to run back, I think it's\nthe USB 1.1 mode, that's the 12 megabits.\n\n371\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.035\nWell, you can go down to that crawl speed.\n\n372\n00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:10.530\nSo if you needed support backwards\ncompatibility you can do that as well.\n\n373\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.200\nSo that right there,that gets our\nonboard devices configured for us.\n\n374\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.930\nPay attention to which one you're\nusing,which component you're using.\n\n375\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.340\nRemember to keep in mind,\n\n376\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.960\nthat if you've put cards in these slots\nthat are performing these functionalities,\n\n377\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.460\nyou might get a conflict here and that\ncould cause you some problems for sure.\n\n378\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.450\nAll right.\n\n379\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.530\nNow, next thing, we got our hard drives.\n\n380\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.770\nIn configuration, if we put the drives in,\nwe gotta configure them.\n\n381\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.690\nNow in this BIOS, one of the things\nI like about this BIOS here,\n\n382\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.340\nDan, is it detects the drives.\n\n383\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.180\nSome BIOSes do not detect the drives.\n\n384\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.870\nWhen you put a drive into a saddle\nport on the motherboard, and\n\n385\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.730\nyou boot it up, if it's not in that zero,\n\n386\n00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.180\nI think it's HDD0 is what the label\nis usually on the motherboard.\n\n387\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.820\nThat means hey, on the first drive,\nmost likely it's gonna be the drive you're\n\n388\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.404\ngonna boot off of and a lot of times that\none's turned on from the manufacturer so\n\n389\n00:20:13.404 --> 00:20:14.920\nyou're good to go with that one.\n\n390\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.900\nBut what if you've just put three other\ndrives in and now you want to do a,\n\n391\n00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.190\nI don't know,\na RAID zero configuration, right?\n\n392\n00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.490\nWe're gonna go,\nludicrous speed to the max.\n\n393\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.890\nWell, the problem is\nsome BIOSes won't detect\n\n394\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.300\nthat that interface has a connection,\nand it doesn't automatically turn it on.\n\n395\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.760\nNow, like,\nDan asked that question earlier.\n\n396\n00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.670\nYou'll notice the majority\nof this is grayed out.\n\n397\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.160\nThe reason it's grayed out Is because\nI didn't have to turn any of these on.\n\n398\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.300\nIn our build, when we were building this\nmachine, we put in the optical drive,\n\n399\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.670\nwe put in the hard drive.\n\n400\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.720\nAnd when I turned that machine on for\n\n401\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.510\nthe very first time,\nwhat do you know, it's ready to go.\n\n402\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.050\nAnd I can see up at the top, port zero.\n\n403\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.520\nThat's our hard drive.\n\n404\n00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.300\nRight, that port zero is typically what\nyour boot drive is going to default to.\n\n405\n00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.030\nAnd it turns it on for us.\n\n406\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:07.340\nNow, if we were gonna configure RAID and\nput in some additional drives,\n\n407\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.270\nthey would be detected but\nthey wouldn't be ready for RAID.\n\n408\n00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.030\nAnd that's where we can actually\ngo to a setting right here,\n\n409\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.720\nyou'll see it's SATA IDE mode but\nI've got a few options here.\n\n410\n00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.260\nYou can see right there in the middle I've\ngot the RAID option that if I want to\n\n411\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.440\nconfigure performance, do a RAID zero,\n\n412\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.780\nconfigure maybe a little\nbit of fault tolerance.\n\n413\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.640\nWell, we'd maybe do a RAID five array,\ndepending on if I have the hard drives and\n\n414\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.040\nthe connections on the motherboard.\n\n415\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.610\nOr I could even go with the advanced\nhost configuration interface too.\n\n416\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.080\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nleave it IDE.\n\n417\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.095\nNo problems, well we won't break\nit until there are problems.\n\n418\n00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:48.700\n[LAUGH] So the next thing we have, too,\nthis is a very, very cool technology.\n\n419\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.690\nI absolutely love this technology.\n\n420\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.960\nThis is the, let me see if I\ncan remember the acronym here,\n\n421\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.805\nsmart self monitoring analysis\nreporting technology.\n\n422\n00:21:56.805 --> 00:22:01.740\n[LAUGH] This is one that helps you\nto diagnose problems on your drives.\n\n423\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.300\nDrives come out of the factory,\ntypically, with errors on them.\n\n424\n00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.820\nIt's just there's enough good technology\nbuilt in to the disk controllers that they\n\n425\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.290\ncan manage it and\nit's really transparent to us.\n\n426\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.010\nSometimes things aren't transparent.\n\n427\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.930\nSometimes we notice right away when\nsomething happens with a drive and\n\n428\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:20.070\nthe SMART analysis here can\nhelp us to again diagnose and\n\n429\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.130\nhopefully correct some of those errors.\n\n430\n00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.325\nSo that's a good one that I would\nsay if your motherboard supports it,\n\n431\n00:22:25.325 --> 00:22:28.515\nwhich a majority of the modern\nmotherboards are gonna support it, or\n\n432\n00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.495\nthe BIOS I should say.\n\n433\n00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:32.985\nKeep it on, don't disable it.\n\n434\n00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:35.215\nAgain, because it could\ncause some problems.\n\n435\n00:22:36.895 --> 00:22:37.485\nAll right,\n\n436\n00:22:37.485 --> 00:22:43.390\nnow let’s say you wanna keep track of\nsome of the more important happenings,\n\n437\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:48.090\nevents that happen within a machine\nwell this is where you can do auditing.\n\n438\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.670\nNow be careful, anytime we say auditing\nif you turn auditing off, or on, and\n\n439\n00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.340\nyou don’t plan to check\nthe logs it’s pretty useless so\n\n440\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.470\nthat will be up to you\nwhether if you turn it on.\n\n441\n00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.430\nYou can see clearing the event logs,\nevent logging is enabled here.\n\n442\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.540\nAgain, some more grayed out information.\n\n443\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.610\nNotice we have some CMOS battery failures,\nit tells us, back in 2006.\n\n444\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.915\nSo looks like we haven't had to\nworry about that for a while.\n\n445\n00:23:10.915 --> 00:23:14.100\n[LAUGH] And again,\nyou can see some additional information.\n\n446\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.630\nWe can turn around if we want.\n\n447\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.590\nWe could clear the logs, again logs in and\nof themselves if you enable it I'm sure\n\n448\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.500\nyou have probably seen this Dan,\nif your doing security auditing right?\n\n449\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.870\nI want, I want to audit everything.\n\n450\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.600\nYou got to turn the audit logs on and you\nhaven't looked at them in three years they\n\n451\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.020\ncan start to be their own\nperformance degradation, so-\n\n452\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.313\n>> Yeah, drinking from a fire hose.\n\n453\n00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:35.285\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right,\n\n454\n00:23:35.285 --> 00:23:38.432\nwe'll hit you with a fire hose,\nwe just don't expect you to stand up for\n\n455\n00:23:38.432 --> 00:23:39.389\ntoo long after that.\n\n456\n00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:43.105\nSo again, that really is basically\nit when it comes to the event logs.\n\n457\n00:23:43.105 --> 00:23:45.321\nDo you want to use them, or\ndo you not want to use them?\n\n458\n00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:49.072\nAnd if you don't want to use them I would\nsay just go ahead and disable them.\n\n459\n00:23:49.072 --> 00:23:52.550\nNow that brings us in to\na very cool technology.\n\n460\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.360\nRight.\nGraphics.\n\n461\n00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.700\nWell everybody's going to have graphics.\n\n462\n00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.630\nIf you don't have video.\n\n463\n00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.810\nWell we can't work with our devices.\n\n464\n00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.710\nI mean it's important to have a video.\n\n465\n00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.690\nEven more important for\n\n466\n00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.460\nme somebody who bases themselves\nout of the graphic user interface.\n\n467\n00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.890\n>> Unless we install a video card.\n\n468\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.080\nRight.\nWe've got that add in card.\n\n469\n00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.690\nAnd here we are.\n\n470\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.810\nWe're confronted yet\n\n471\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:16.040\nagain with an onboard component kind\nof conflicting with our add in stuff.\n\n472\n00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.500\nAnd I've noticed one thing.\n\n473\n00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.360\nIt defaults to itself.\n\n474\n00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.230\nIt says hey, I've got this.\n\n475\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.310\nI know you've got that beef monster in\nthere as far as graphics adapters go,\n\n476\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.505\nbut we're gonna use my on board.\n\n477\n00:24:26.505 --> 00:24:27.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n478\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.200\nNow this one I actually like on this BIOS.\n\n479\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.550\nAll right.\nDan's absolutely right.\n\n480\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.210\nIn fact on the board that I have,\nit didn't detect it.\n\n481\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.760\nAnd there's been some other like,\n\n482\n00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.830\nsome other Dell machines that\nI've worked with before.\n\n483\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.244\nThat if you put an on board video card in,\nand\n\n484\n00:24:44.244 --> 00:24:48.034\nyou're plugged into the back of\nthe motherboard's on board video,\n\n485\n00:24:48.034 --> 00:24:52.370\nthe BIOS would throw you a warning and\nit'd basically say, stop.\n\n486\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.830\nDo not pass go.\n\n487\n00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:54.540\nDo not collect $200.\n\n488\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.790\nGo straight to jail.\n\n489\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.000\nNo, actually, it really didn't say that.\n\n490\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.010\nIt just said you better just reboot\nthe machine, unplug, boot back into BIOS,\n\n491\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.420\nand then go ahead and reconfigure it.\n\n492\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.820\nNow, with this one,\ngetting back to this BIOS here,\n\n493\n00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.270\none of the things I like about it,\nauto-sensing.\n\n494\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.947\nIt says, hey,\nI can detect that $50,000 graphics card\n\n495\n00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:20.635\nthat's ten feet long,\nthat's on the motherboard right now.\n\n496\n00:25:20.635 --> 00:25:23.676\nSo what I'll do is I'll just go ahead and\nI'll back off.\n\n497\n00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:25.360\nI'll let that machine go ahead.\n\n498\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.850\nI'll let the adapter card go ahead and\ntake care of everything.\n\n499\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.330\nNow what's good about this\nsetting is let's say that Dan and\n\n500\n00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.760\nI decided hey,\nwe gotta take that card out.\n\n501\n00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.290\nWell, if we take the card out\nit should default to auto.\n\n502\n00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:43.353\nNow I don't believe this actually\nhas an on board video system,\n\n503\n00:25:43.353 --> 00:25:48.570\nso any time you do auto-detect,\nit should detect it for you.\n\n504\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.200\nAgain, a lot of the things today in\nyour adapter cards that are installed,\n\n505\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.550\nthey're all plug and play.\n\n506\n00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:58.110\nAnd inside of your BIOS you have something\nknown as the extended system configuration\n\n507\n00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.110\ndata region.\n\n508\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.200\nAnd it's a little part of the ROM chip\nthat allows it to pull information\n\n509\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.140\non the fly in and out before\nthe operating system comes online and\n\n510\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.270\nthen finally the operating system plug and\nplay takes over.\n\n511\n00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.600\nSo, the good thing for that?\n\n512\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.040\nWe don't really have to worry about it.\n\n513\n00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.350\nAll right, now.\n\n514\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.490\nNext thing that we really need\nto look at is the monitoring and\n\n515\n00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.520\nthe control, fan control section here.\n\n516\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.020\nThis is actually really, really cool.\n\n517\n00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.770\nNow I know I keep saying everything's\nreally cool but I really like this BIOS.\n\n518\n00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:36.630\nAnd the real-time hardware monitoring\nis to me, is an amazing component here.\n\n519\n00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:41.120\nAnd when we get in here we can see\nthings like the current CPU fan speed.\n\n520\n00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.110\nIf you notice a norm.\n\n521\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.430\nSee one of the good things about\nthe hardware monitoring is,\n\n522\n00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.600\nlet's say that we boot this computer up,\nwe're using it for awhile, and\n\n523\n00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.400\nwe see on average, let's say it's a 4,000,\nalmost 4,500 RPMs.\n\n524\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:01.000\nWell, if you're doing video encoding and\nstuff like that, and you\n\n525\n00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.880\nturn around you come in here and you see\nthose RPMs are jacked up pretty much, you\n\n526\n00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.450\nmight find that maybe you need to upgrade\nwhatever your cooling system is here.\n\n527\n00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.860\nNow, I know that Dan and I, we've got\na pretty decent cooling system in here.\n\n528\n00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.940\nAnd it's liquid-cooled so we shouldn't\nreally have any problems with that.\n\n529\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.830\nNow, the last two fans here, be careful\n\n530\n00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:28.380\nbecause there's things that you can see\nin here and things that you can't see.\n\n531\n00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.130\nAll right, so let's start with what we\ncan see and it's obvious right here.\n\n532\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.920\nWe can see the front and\nthe rear fan speeds.\n\n533\n00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.050\nThis is contingent on plugging\nthe fans into the motherboard itself.\n\n534\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.840\nYou usually see three pin and\nfour pin headers, and\n\n535\n00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.740\nthey usually take these\nMolex KK connectors.\n\n536\n00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.150\nMolex is an international\ncompany that makes connectors,\n\n537\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:56.410\nand KK just happens to be a product\nline within their company there.\n\n538\n00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.240\nIf you don't use those,\nyou have another option.\n\n539\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.800\nIf maybe you wanna put in\nadditional fans in here,\n\n540\n00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.140\nyou can connect them to the full sized\nMolex connectors that the old IDE and\n\n541\n00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.300\nSCSI drives,\nparallel SCSI drives would take.\n\n542\n00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.620\nWell, even the modern SCSI drives.\n\n543\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.940\nThe problem with that is that's just\na power rail coming off of the back of\n\n544\n00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.620\nthe power supply itself.\n\n545\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.180\nSo when you do that the BIOS goes I\ndon't know what you're talking about\n\n546\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.760\nthere's no fan there.\n\n547\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.440\nSo it really can't control it, so good\nthings here, we can monitor things like\n\n548\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.020\nour processor temperatures, we can monitor\nthings like our core voltages as well.\n\n549\n00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.630\nNotice everything's great out here again.\n\n550\n00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.430\nSo that really means we can configure it.\n\n551\n00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:41.140\nSo it's here's your candy, but\nyou can't do anything with it.\n\n552\n00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.400\nBut it's a great thing to have.\n\n553\n00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.120\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nthe onboard monitoring's amazing.\n\n554\n00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.830\nYou can do fan control.\n\n555\n00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.440\nYou can also do system fan\ncontrol in the slowest speed too.\n\n556\n00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.480\nSo if you want to turn\nit off you can do that.\n\n557\n00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.430\nOr if you want to always\njust have a low speed,\n\n558\n00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.290\nlow RPMs going on it,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n559\n00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.110\nA cooler system is\na better running system,\n\n560\n00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:05.900\nless damage, I wouldn't disable this,\nand I would use it.\n\n561\n00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.460\nAll right.\n\n562\n00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.730\nNow, let me, I'll tell you what,\nlet me show you here.\n\n563\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.610\nI could turn that on or off,\nit's just like a light switch.\n\n564\n00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.450\nIt's either you're gonna enable it or\nyou're gonna say,\n\n565\n00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:18.650\nwhen the fan's not needed,\ndon't turn it on.\n\n566\n00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.230\nAll right.\n\n567\n00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.110\nLast but not least in this\nsection here we've got all of our\n\n568\n00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:30.000\nPCIe slots on the motherboards and\nthis is great.\n\n569\n00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.410\nI can tell if they're populated or not.\n\n570\n00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.340\nSo you can see that crazy 16 lane\ncard that we've got sitting in\n\n571\n00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.380\nthe motherboard right now.\n\n572\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.700\nWell, I can tell you it's in slot five.\n\n573\n00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.200\nThat's great.\n\n574\n00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.362\nSo I guess we've got a slot machine here.\n\n575\n00:29:42.362 --> 00:29:43.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n576\n00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.710\nthat's really nice information, right.\n\n577\n00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.460\nTo be able to say,\nI can go into my BIOS and\n\n578\n00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.880\nI don't have to look and pop the case\nopen to see what card is where.\n\n579\n00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.540\nI can just jump right into the BIOS and\nsay oh, it's in slot two.\n\n580\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.680\nNow I can look at the back, oh there\nit is, great, everything's working.\n\n581\n00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.605\nIt's detecting it, it's on fire,\nor whatever's happening, right.\n\n582\n00:30:00.605 --> 00:30:01.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's given us a lot of\n\n583\n00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:02.690\ngood information.\n\n584\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.120\n>> Yeah, and\nlet me expand on that a little bit.\n\n585\n00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.880\nIf you look at slot five,\nnotice that there's a vendor ID.\n\n586\n00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.560\nHave you ever wondered what your video\ncard in a machine that maybe you were\n\n587\n00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.740\nsupporting and\nyou said I don't know what it is.\n\n588\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.370\nThen what do we do?\n\n589\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.820\nWe unplug everything, we take the case up,\nwe turn it on its side,\n\n590\n00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.180\nwe open it up, we say oh, it's an in\nvideo card or oh, it's an ATI card.\n\n591\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.690\nWell, okay now let me go ahead and\ntake the card out of the slot and\n\n592\n00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.770\nlook for whatever the SED number is on it,\nusually very small.\n\n593\n00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.260\nI can take the vendor ID right here and\n\n594\n00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.400\nif I need to now what adapter\nthis is well, I'm good to go.\n\n595\n00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.490\nAnd I can take that information and\nI can find out without\n\n596\n00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.080\nactually having to open the machine,\nand that makes it a lot easier.\n\n597\n00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.240\n>> Yeah it does, and\nit's a lot of good information.\n\n598\n00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.150\nAs you can see, the BIOS is actually\na pretty helpful system not just for\n\n599\n00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.150\ngetting our computers running and\ndetecting hardware.\n\n600\n00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:48.790\nAnd things like that.\n\n601\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.240\nBut giving us a lot of information and\neven a bit of control.\n\n602\n00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.660\nNow Wes, we've got quite a few-\n>> We have.\n\n603\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.330\n>> More topics to go over\nwhen it comes to BIOS.\n\n604\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.800\nBut I'm looking at this clock and\nit has run out of time.\n\n605\n00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.745\n>> I've talked a lot, man.\n\n606\n00:31:00.745 --> 00:31:01.785\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a lot to cover.\n\n607\n00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:03.947\nSo it looks like we're gonna have\nto do a part two on this guy.\n\n608\n00:31:03.947 --> 00:31:05.733\n>> Sounds good, sounds good.\n>> I look forward to seeing you there.\n\n609\n00:31:05.733 --> 00:31:07.550\nI look forward to seeing\neverybody else there.\n\n610\n00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.370\nThanks for watching.\n\n611\n00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.260\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTv.\n\n612\n00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.150\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n613\n00:31:12.150 -->

ITProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:20.052\nI'm your host It's Daniel Lowery,\njoining me in the studio yet again today,\n\n4\n00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.053\nit's my good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:22.993\nHow are you doing today, Wes?\n\n6\n00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:23.933\n>> I'm doing good.\n\n7\n00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.220\nIt's good to be back her\non the IT ProTV stage.\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.270\nWe're moving into part two and\nwe're continuing along with our PC build.\n\n9\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.630\nIf you need to check out some of\nthe first parts of BIOS configuration.\n\n10\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.240\nWe can see that in part one.\n\n11\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.360\nNow we're gonna jump right into\nwell performance configurations and\n\n12\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.040\nsome of the peeks and\nsweeps we can do inside of the BIOS.\n\n13\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.770\nNow on this next screen\nthat you're gonna see here,\n\n14\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.890\nit's gonna give you this big old warning\nthat says well wait a second here.\n\n15\n00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.630\nAnd the next thing that you do,\nyou've gotta be very careful.\n\n16\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.750\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna ignore the warning.\n\n17\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.730\n>> That warning is both big and old.\n\n18\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.040\n>> It is, it is.\n\n19\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.080\nNow we're gonna give a test at the end\nof the day on the last part of this so\n\n20\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.400\nhopefully you can see that out there,\nright?\n\n21\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.110\nJust kidding here.\n\n22\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.330\nSo let's go ahead and ignore\nthe warning and we're gonna say yes.\n\n23\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.870\nNow here's where we get into a few\ndifferent components that we can do\n\n24\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.050\noverrides on.\n\n25\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.111\nAnd, well, it's always nice to\noverride something if you can, right?\n\n26\n00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:22.852\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:26.240\nNow Wes, is this the same idea, I've\nheard of things like overclocking, right?\n\n28\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.290\nWhere you're kinda, your processor or\nyour RAM or whatever is set to work at\n\n29\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.430\na certain speed, and you kinda say you\nknow what, we're gonna put the giggle\n\n30\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.280\ngas on, some nitrous oxide, and make it\ngo a little faster than it's supposed to.\n\n31\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.810\nIs this what we do with that?\n\n32\n00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.420\n>> That's right.\n\n33\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.300\nOverclocking.\n\n34\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.830\nOverclocking is applying more\nvoltage to the components.\n\n35\n00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.910\nAnd you've got to be careful with that\nbecause there are system defaults or\n\n36\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.660\nthe recommended specifications\nto what kind of\n\n37\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.030\nvoltage should be applied to\nthese independent components.\n\n38\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.880\nAnd that's one of the reasons they call\nit override is because you're overriding\n\n39\n00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.030\nwhat the default's here.\n\n40\n00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560\nSo when we get into this you can see,\nfor instance, if we want to overclock\n\n41\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.620\nthe processor, we want to put more\nvoltage on that processor that we can,\n\n42\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.290\nbut you typically have to\nramp up the cooling systems.\n\n43\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.410\nNow, we've actually done that.\n\n44\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.820\nWhen we put together this PC\nwe actually put one of those,\n\n45\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.830\nI think it's an H60 Corsair\nliquid cooling system.\n\n46\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.970\nSo, this can actually take\na little bit of overclocking,\n\n47\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.060\ndepending on how much voltage that you're,\nif you want to overclock is really\n\n48\n00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.050\ngonna be contingent on the cooling system\nthat you have inside of the system unit.\n\n49\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.940\nSo be careful with that.\n\n50\n00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.220\nKnow that there are some limitations.\n\n51\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.060\nAnd the other thing to know is that you\ncould void your warranty [LAUGH] because\n\n52\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.730\nif you put more voltage on that processor\nand you end up doing some damage to it\n\n53\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.160\nwell, that's not gonna be\na really good day at the office.\n\n54\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.590\nMemory overrides, again, overclocking,\nas we're gonna overclock,\n\n55\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.300\nput more voltage on the memory.\n\n56\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.510\nNow, one of the things that I want you to\nnotice here is that on memory overrides,\n\n57\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.810\nit mentions that this is 1081, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.440\nSo, we'll just say 1080 megahertz.\n\n59\n00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.090\nSee, the RAM that we've installed in this\nsystem is actually 1600 megahertz RAM\n\n60\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.220\nso one of the things that\nwe can do here is we can\n\n61\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.410\noverclock this memory from what it's\ndetecting, and apply more voltage.\n\n62\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.290\nSo let's go ahead and do that, let's\nsee if we can blow the machine up here.\n\n63\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.170\nNotice that it says that the performance\nprofile here is automatic,\n\n64\n00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.980\nit's non ECC, so\nit's not error correcting code.\n\n65\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.680\nWe're gonna choose Automatic and\nwe're gonna set Manual.\n\n66\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.510\nWhen we choose Manual here, now we've got\nsome ability to set individual timings and\n\n67\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.600\nstuff like that or in case what we're\ngonna do we're just gonna apply some\n\n68\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.410\nvoltage and to do that you're actually\ngonna go into the Memory Multiplier.\n\n69\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.730\nAnd you'll see by default\nhere it's defaulting to 8.\n\n70\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.280\nWe're actually gonna set\nthat multiplier up to 12.\n\n71\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.820\nWe'll choose Enter here.\n\n72\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.560\nRemember Escape takes you out of an area.\n\n73\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.300\nEnter brings you into a selection,\nthe up and\n\n74\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.700\ndown arrow allows you to change and\nmake your choice here.\n\n75\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.700\nNow, this is one of those settings that\nyou definitely, any kind of setting\n\n76\n00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.120\nthat you make a change to, it's gonna\nrequire a reboot to store it in the BIOS,\n\n77\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.180\nbut be careful with this one,\nbecause when you do reboot the machine,\n\n78\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.010\nit's gonna apply more voltage\nthan what the default is.\n\n79\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.190\nSo make sure that that cooling\nsystem works really well.\n\n80\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.800\nSo, we'll go ahead and do that here.\n\n81\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.700\nOn this one it's down there in the lower\nright hand corner you can see F12 or\n\n82\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.840\nno, F10 here to Save and Exit, so\nwe'll go ahead and Save and Exit.\n\n83\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.561\nAnd let's see here,\n\n84\n00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:52.880\nand yes, and now it's gonna take\njust a little bit to reboot.\n\n85\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.130\nAnd as this is rebooting, just as a recap,\nany time you do the overclocking\n\n86\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.130\nyou wanna step up the cooling system so\nfor\n\n87\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.100\ninstance what Dan and I have in\nthe computer here is we've got a radiator,\n\n88\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.770\npart of the liquid cooling system and\nit's attached to the rear fan.\n\n89\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.230\nWe've got a water block\nplaced down on the CPU.\n\n90\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.950\nNow, that's great for the CPU.\n\n91\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.828\nThere isn't anything on the memory, so\nyou have to pay attention to the memory.\n\n92\n00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:24.660\nThis G scale memory that we have in\nhere has heat spreaders on it, and\n\n93\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.590\nwe've got some nice,\ngood sized fans inside of the system, so\n\n94\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.140\nwe should be okay and that's one of the\nthings that you might wanna go back in and\n\n95\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.930\nyou might wanna check out things\nlike your temperature monitoring.\n\n96\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.960\nMaking sure that the core voltage,\nor the temperature of the memory,\n\n97\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.640\ntemperature of the CPU is\nstaying where it needs to be.\n\n98\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.390\nBecause, even though this voltage\ndoesn't directly affect the CPU,\n\n99\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.370\nindirectly, anytime you raise voltage,\nyou raise heat.\n\n100\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.400\nThe ambient heat within the case.\n\n101\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.390\nSo you could see that\nthere are some problems.\n\n102\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.090\nMake sure that the cooling system can\n\n103\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.240\nhandle any extra voltage\nthat you apply to it.\n\n104\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.380\n>> Yeah, it's gonna be a good way to get\nyourself a nice thermal shutdown, because\n\n105\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.450\nthings are getting a little too warm\n>> And so the computer you gotta remember\n\n106\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.620\nthey tend to heat up as you push\ndown on the gas with these things.\n\n107\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.960\nSo make sure you have\na nice cooling system.\n\n108\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.220\nMake sure that you have fans installed.\n\n109\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.770\nIf you're going to be doing\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n110\n00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.630\nNow normally if you're just\nrunning a regular PC that you want\n\n111\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.170\nto get on the internet,\nyou want to do some spreadsheets and\n\n112\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.700\nthings of that nature,\njust work type stuff, regular computing.\n\n113\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.250\nYou're not gonna have to worry about that.\n\n114\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.930\nThis is kinda the thing for gamers or\nif you're doing some sort of simulations.\n\n115\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.470\nThings of that nature that\nare gonna be resource intensive and\n\n116\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.080\nyou really want to throw everything and\nthe kitchen sink at it.\n\n117\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.060\nThen we can overclock here and\n\n118\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.950\nyou'll want to install those thermal\ncountermeasures, as they were,\n\n119\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.620\nto make sure that you don't get above\nregs, and start a nice case fire.\n\n120\n00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.241\nThat's always fun.\n\n121\n00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> And that's why it's also important to\n\n122\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.440\nmake sure that you have some kind of fans\nthat are connected to the motherboard,\n\n123\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.947\nbecause any of the fans\nthat are plugged into\n\n124\n00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:13.180\nthe motherboard you can\nmonitor the temperature.\n\n125\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.910\nA lot of the motherboards might have built\ninto them a thermal temperature sensor,\n\n126\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.080\npay attention to the configurations.\n\n127\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.910\nI know that within this\nmotherboard there's an LED light.\n\n128\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.870\nWell, the LED light's not really\ndoing me much good [LAUGH] right now\n\n129\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.310\nbecause it's about a millimeter,\nmaybe, max, and it's in the case.\n\n130\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.420\nAnd with overclocking,\n\n131\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.495\nyou're telling me it's not gonna\nmake my emails go any faster?\n\n132\n00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.870\n[LAUGH] Darn.\n\n133\n00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.430\nSo, that is something that's a little bit\nmore advanced, so just be prepared for it.\n\n134\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:46.160\nAnd also be prepared to any warranty\nof violations that might happen.\n\n135\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.060\nSo that leads us to the next, wait, let\nme make sure I don't get out of here yet.\n\n136\n00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.804\nThat leads us to the next component or\nsection, and that's security.\n\n137\n00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:58.952\nAnd security is, it can be important when\nyou're in a heavily managed environment.\n\n138\n00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:01.881\nWhen you're in a heavily\nmanaged environment,\n\n139\n00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.668\nyou might want to make sure that only\ncertain people Can configure the BIOS, and\n\n140\n00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.740\nonly certain people can boot the machine.\n\n141\n00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.930\nNow understand when you\nset a password here,\n\n142\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.540\nthis isn't the password\nin the operating system.\n\n143\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.370\nThis is a password that allows the user,\nfor\n\n144\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.150\ninstance, if we set\nthe user password here.\n\n145\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.200\nAlright.\n\n146\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.370\nWhen I set the password, and\nwe'll set our super secret password here.\n\n147\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.571\nAnd it's gonna ask us to confirm it.\n\n148\n00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:32.766\nLooks like I can type\nthe same password twice.\n\n149\n00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:33.706\nPerfect.\n>> Good for you.\n\n150\n00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:38.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> What this user password does,\n\n151\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:44.240\nthe user password says now this user that\nhas the password can boot the machine.\n\n152\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.880\nIf you have a password protected user\naccount, which the majority of us do,\n\n153\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.520\nif you don't your should, you'll still\nneed the operating system password too.\n\n154\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.830\nSo now you've also,\nnot only added a level of security,\n\n155\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.180\nyou've potentially added a level\nof complexity to your end user.\n\n156\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.940\nSo you're gonna wanna make sure\nthat they know that password.\n\n157\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.510\nThe BIOS or supervisor password,\nsometimes called an admin password.\n\n158\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.140\nThat means not only can I boot the\nmachine, but I can get back in here and\n\n159\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.840\nmake changes if I need to.\n\n160\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.151\nCouple of other things that we have here.\n\n161\n00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:17.962\nThey have a physical layer level IDS,\nintrustion detection system,\n\n162\n00:09:17.962 --> 00:09:22.121\nand that's essentially what\nthe chassis intrusion means,\n\n163\n00:09:22.121 --> 00:09:24.826\nit's an intrusion detection system.\n\n164\n00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:29.050\nNow it's not going to stop\nanybody from opening the case.\n\n165\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.140\nAt that point if somebody\ncan touch the case,\n\n166\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.950\nyou've probably got bigger\nproblems to worry about.\n\n167\n00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.370\nAll this lets you know\nis that when we reboot,\n\n168\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.210\nit's gonna say somebody's opened a case.\n\n169\n00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.310\nSo it lets me know if maybe\nI've got encrypted information,\n\n170\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.350\nif it happens to be a server or if it\nhappens to be a specialty work station,\n\n171\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.360\nwhere you've got sensitive\npayment information on there,\n\n172\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.170\nthen you might want to set this.\n\n173\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.670\nNow, this is always, [LAUGH] this is\ninteresting here, is because the next one,\n\n174\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.700\nIntel VT?\n\n175\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.440\nThat's just their\nvirtualization technology.\n\n176\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.320\nIf you wanna run a hypervisor\non your machine,\n\n177\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.930\nyou have to make sure that\nthe processor supports it.\n\n178\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.730\nMost of the modern processors support it.\n\n179\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.360\nIntel's got their VT technology,\nAMD's got AMDV.\n\n180\n00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.770\nPay attention to whether it's enabled or\nnot.\n\n181\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.390\nIn this case,\nthis one is enabled by default.\n\n182\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.740\nI think AMD,\nI think you actually have to turn it on.\n\n183\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.580\nI'm pretty sure Intel turns theirs on like\nyou can see, cuz these are the default\n\n184\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.340\nsettings, by the way here,\nwhere there's no smoke and mirrors.\n\n185\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.350\nWe got done with the build.\n\n186\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.780\nThis is a factory defaults here.\n\n187\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.620\nSo one of the things you can see,\nIntel has theirs on by default.\n\n188\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.420\nNow, that is,\n\n189\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.010\nyou know as far as security goes,\nyou notice there's this clear password.\n\n190\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.720\nOne of the last things I might want to say\nabout this is if you forget the password,\n\n191\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.030\nthe user password, well it's not that\nbig of a deal, because if you know\n\n192\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.200\nthe supervisor, the administrator\npassword, you can get in here.\n\n193\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.060\nWhat happens if you forget\nthe administrator password?\n\n194\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.750\nYou won't be able to see his clear\npassword option, and one of the easiest\n\n195\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.320\nways to clear a password for\nus is to flip the CMOS battery out.\n\n196\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.120\nYou really don't have to\neven do that much any more.\n\n197\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.670\nA lot of these boards will\nhave a push-button reset.\n\n198\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.460\nThis one, again,\nbeing a budget build, remember,\n\n199\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.130\nwe're paying attention to how\nmuch money we're spending on it,\n\n200\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.310\nthis is in a little bit of an older\nboard and it still has these jumpers.\n\n201\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.640\nJumper blocks that you gotta reconfigure,\nand all it does, guys,\n\n202\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.370\neither way whichever,\nwhatever [LAUGH] method you use,\n\n203\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.910\nit's cutting the voltage to the CMOS and\nit clears everything out for us.\n\n204\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.530\n>> Yeah that was one of the old\ntricks that we'd have to do.\n\n205\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:36.550\nYou'd buy some boards maybe, or buy a\ncomputer off of eBay or online somewhere.\n\n206\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.390\nAnd you're like, oh this is awesome, and\nyou go to log in and it's asking you for\n\n207\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.078\nthat password.\n\n208\n00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:44.020\nAnd you're like, oh this is\nkilling me cuz you don't have it.\n\n209\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.550\nYou can do the old jumper trick or\nyou can just pop the battery out.\n\n210\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.370\nAnywhere that you just take\nthat power away from CMOS so\n\n211\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.400\nthat all those settings will\nclear back to their defaults.\n\n212\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.080\nThen you should be back in the case and\nback in business.\n\n213\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.130\n>> Don't forget to check the side of\nthe monitor or underneath the keyboard.\n\n214\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.650\nThat's where a lot of\npeople store passwords.\n\n215\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:01.550\nJust kidding guys.\n\n216\n00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.393\nNever store your passwords there.\n\n217\n00:12:03.393 --> 00:12:06.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well the next thing that we ge to look\n\n218\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.180\nat is power!\n\n219\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.880\nI mean everybody's gotta\nhave a little bit of power.\n\n220\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.680\nAnd one of the first options\nyou see here is speed step.\n\n221\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.350\nSpeed step is a technology, it's what they\ncall a multi-voltage positioning system.\n\n222\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:22.420\nIt just intelligently manages how much\npower's that the CPU's consuming and\n\n223\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.750\nif you're not using, the processing power,\nkind of like Dan said earlier,\n\n224\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.670\nif you're sending emails,\ndoing a little word processing,\n\n225\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.500\nyou might not need all\nthe voltage to the CPU.\n\n226\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.920\nSo, intelligently, they can lower the\nvoltage, save you a little bit of money.\n\n227\n00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.260\nIf you're running a work station,\n\n228\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.268\nit might not be as important to you\nas if you have this in your laptop,\n\n229\n00:12:39.268 --> 00:12:43.400\nwhere you're power, you know, to conserve\npower, battery life, if you will.\n\n230\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.340\nSome of these other power,\nthese power technologies,\n\n231\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.870\nhave you ever seen some of these here?\n\n232\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.300\n>> Oh yeah,\nI've had to use these, actually,\n\n233\n00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.850\nquite extensively in previous\njobs that I've had because, well,\n\n234\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.360\nsometimes you have a computer that's\nnot being used by a lot of people.\n\n235\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.230\nAnd you want to make sure this stays on.\n\n236\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.820\nSo I would go into these\npower settings and\n\n237\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.300\nI'd make sure like, I think you have\none there that says power management.\n\n238\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.590\nUsually inside of something like that or\ndepending on your BIOS again,\n\n239\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.620\nyou'll see things like what do you want\nto do if the computer loses power.\n\n240\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.020\nDo you want it to stay powered off?\n\n241\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.790\nDo you want it to come back on?\n\n242\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.390\nOr how do you want to work this?\n\n243\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.550\nA lot of times you say,\nwell, I want this to be on.\n\n244\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.640\nI need it to be on as much as possible so\nthat I don't have to bother anybody.\n\n245\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.010\nI'll just set that to power on.\n\n246\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.620\nBut you gotta remember,\nyou gotta really plan, and\n\n247\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.740\nhere in Florida we have a lot of lightning\nactivity and power issues because of it.\n\n248\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.750\nSo I had to be very careful to make sure\nthere was like a UPS attached to these\n\n249\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:40.190\nthings, because if there wasn't, and I set\nthat to bring it to a powered on state,\n\n250\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.630\nand once it goes off, if it loses power,\nwell, the power could be flapping, right?\n\n251\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.040\nIt could be on, off, on, off,\n\n252\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.180\non, off, and it's continually\ntrying to boot this thing.\n\n253\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.450\nThat kind of thing can be damaging to your\nsystem, so I might wanna not to do that,\n\n254\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.630\nso you have to learn to plan accordingly.\n\n255\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.110\nI used this a lot, sometimes what I would\ndo in those case if I knew there was gonna\n\n256\n00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.880\nbe UPS, I would say power on at 6:00 AM.\n\n257\n00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.900\nSo if you do lose power, at least\nI'm probably just without you, for\n\n258\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.715\nthe day and that's fine,\nI won't have to worry about it.\n\n259\n00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:13.140\n6:00 comes along and the thing\nreboots itself, and I should be good.\n\n260\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.760\nThat storm is probably over at that time\nand we're not experiencing another one,\n\n261\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.380\nunlikely but it could happen.\n\n262\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.160\nBut with just a little planning, these\npower options can be very, very helpful.\n\n263\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.000\n>> Yeah you know,\nin one of those situations that I've used,\n\n264\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.380\nis this option here where it says\nwake on LAN from S5 state, in fact,\n\n265\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.950\nDan and I were talking about\nthis before the episode,\n\n266\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.940\nwe were talking about what\ndo these S standards mean?\n\n267\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.450\nWell, that's actually an industry\nset of standards here, S0 to S5.\n\n268\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.157\nAnd again, depending on the vendor and\nthe manufacturer,\n\n269\n00:14:43.157 --> 00:14:46.920\nit'll really dictate what\nthey're actually using.\n\n270\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.780\nSo Wake on LAN is from the S5 is\na completely powered off state.\n\n271\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.860\nAnd this is handy.\n\n272\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.600\nLike for instance, when I was running my\nmedia center, I'd want my computer to be\n\n273\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.880\non at a certain time in order to\nrecord whatever the movie was.\n\n274\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.310\nAnd I actually had a smaller\nmachine that took less power.\n\n275\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.219\nSo what I'd do is I'd task schedule it\na wake on land packet from the little\n\n276\n00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:14.066\nmachine, and it would fire off a wall\npacket over to this machine that was\n\n277\n00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:16.805\nalready turned off, and\nit would bring it online.\n\n278\n00:15:16.805 --> 00:15:19.945\nAnd then from there I had a task\nschedule to record the movie, and\n\n279\n00:15:19.945 --> 00:15:22.110\nthen turn around and\nshut the machine down.\n\n280\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.660\nSo it's a really good thing to have.\n\n281\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.129\nFor instance, you look at Windows.\n\n282\n00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:31.522\nThe S4 state is their hibernation state,\nand\n\n283\n00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:35.525\nthen S1 through S3 are your\ndifferent sleep levels.\n\n284\n00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:40.373\nAnd today it's kinda interesting, Windows\ndoes this hybrid low powered state.\n\n285\n00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:44.114\nIt's a cross between sleep and\nhibernation, so hibernation just writing\n\n286\n00:15:44.114 --> 00:15:47.270\nyour data to the hard drive and\nthen shutting everything down.\n\n287\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.800\nYou don't have to worry\nabout losing power.\n\n288\n00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.950\nBecause well the power's\ngonna be turned off and\n\n289\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.560\nyour information's safe on the drive.\n\n290\n00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.670\nThe sleep state's easy to get back to\na production desktop really quick.\n\n291\n00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.970\nBut keeps a little bit of\nRAM there on your data.\n\n292\n00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.030\nYou have to worry about losing the data.\n\n293\n00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.114\nWell, Microsoft and Windows blended both.\n\n294\n00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:05.128\nThey said, if you're in a sleep state,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n295\n00:16:05.128 --> 00:16:06.834\nwrite that information to\nthe hard drive for you.\n\n296\n00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:11.104\nSo, just in case you lose power, you\nstill have access to your information, so\n\n297\n00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:12.719\nthey actually use both here.\n\n298\n00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:16.190\nAnd then you can see some of\nthe other options here as well.\n\n299\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.190\nAnd again, just different power management\noptions, features that you might have and\n\n300\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.140\nyou might need to use.\n\n301\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.810\nAnd some of them could\nbe beneficial to you.\n\n302\n00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.080\nSome of them, you can see we've\ngot the last three disabled.\n\n303\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.300\nI might actually turn on that wake,\nwake system from s five,\n\n304\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.660\nor basically what it means guys,\ntake some of the jargon out,\n\n305\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.290\nit means I'm gonna wake this computer up\nfrom a wake on LAN when it's turned off.\n\n306\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.980\nAnd that is a very,\nvery handy option to have.\n\n307\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.160\nNow, one of the last ones\nthat we get into is Boot.\n\n308\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.640\nNow when we talk about Boot,\n\n309\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.530\nwe're not talking about the boots\nthat we wear on our feet.\n\n310\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.070\nWhat we're talking about is how we\nget this operating system online,\n\n311\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.240\nand where are we gonna look for\nthe operating system?\n\n312\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.300\nSo we could do boot menu type,\nboot priority.\n\n313\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.720\nNow one of the things that\nI've seen In other systems,\n\n314\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.150\nas they might call this device priority,\nthey might call it boot order,\n\n315\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.050\nit's all right, don't worry about that.\n\n316\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.640\nWhat it's saying is,\nwhen the BIOS is done doing its job,\n\n317\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.680\nwhat is the first device you want me\nto look for the operating system?\n\n318\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.760\nNow, if I've got a situation where\nmaybe I'm doing network boots,\n\n319\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.920\nbecause I wanna be able to reimage\na machine every week at a certain time.\n\n320\n00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.200\nI might actually set, like, for\n\n321\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.380\ninstance to be able to boot\nto the network adapter first.\n\n322\n00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.690\nAnd what it does is then if it doesn't\nfind it's boot record it says okay, well,\n\n323\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.010\nI didn't find it on the optical drive.\n\n324\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.780\nIn this case I'm gonna go to\nthe floppy drive, you know,\n\n325\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.950\ncause everybody's got\na floppy drive today.\n\n326\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.940\nDidn't find it on the floppy drive, and\nit's just going to go down the list and\n\n327\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.270\nsearch for it.\n\n328\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.680\nYou also have hard drive order,\nnot really too much to see here,\n\n329\n00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.110\nbecause we only have one hard drive,\nyeah, so.\n\n330\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.100\nIf it can't find this order,\nyou gotta problem here.\n\n331\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.050\nSome of the other options,\nalmost self explanatory here.\n\n332\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.660\nOptical drive order, we've only got one,\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n333\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.670\nDo we wanna be able to\nboot to optical drives?\n\n334\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.380\nIf you wanna do local installations,\nthat's an option you might wanna have.\n\n335\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.320\nDo you wanna boot from a USB drive or\ndevice?\n\n336\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.440\nWell, that's the other one there.\n\n337\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.260\nNotice boot to removable devices.\n\n338\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.580\nPixy boot, I mentioned booting\nto the network adapter,\n\n339\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.060\nallowing the network adapter\nto call out to the network and\n\n340\n00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.010\nsay, I need an operating system,\ncan you find me one?\n\n341\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.190\nWell that's what this option does here,\nagain USB boot.\n\n342\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.590\nOops, let me get back there,\njust a bit outside, ball one.\n\n343\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.350\nAnd then USB master or\nemulation type, UEFI,\n\n344\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.040\nwe've been primarily talking about\nBIOS system cuz that's what this is.\n\n345\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.330\nThere's a more modern firmware\nplatform that was developed by Intel,\n\n346\n00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.320\nthat's called\nthe Unified Accessible Firmware Interface.\n\n347\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.730\nAnd when we turn this on, we can get\nadditional features like, for instance,\n\n348\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.460\nsecure boot, safely booting\nthe operating system at the low,\n\n349\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.690\nearly portions of the boot up process.\n\n350\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.840\nThere's some benefits to that,\nfor sure, if you want that.\n\n351\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.680\nI've got this disabled\nbasically in the legacy system,\n\n352\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.870\ncuz that's what we're operating here.\n\n353\n00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.090\nSo we don't really change that.\n\n354\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.890\nNow one of the things that I like is cool,\nboot display options.\n\n355\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.156\nDo you wanna tell the BIOS what\nkeyboard shortcut you wanna use?\n\n356\n00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:17.160\nOr keystroke that you have to push\nin order to get into the bios?\n\n357\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.610\nOr to bring up the onetime\nboot menu which tells you, and\n\n358\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.330\nthat’s another thing I should mention too,\nwhen we’re talking about boot.\n\n359\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.450\nThe difference between, let me get\nback here to the device priority.\n\n360\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.920\nThis information stays within the ROM,\n\n361\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.120\nwhen you set this think\nof it as hard-wiring,\n\n362\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.160\nyou're telling the bios every single\ntime you boot up you will look here.\n\n363\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:44.270\nWell you also have the option to\npresent a one time boot menu all right?\n\n364\n00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.880\nAnd the one time boot menu you can see\nhere is, press F10 to enter the boot menu.\n\n365\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.150\nYou're not modifying the ROM at all.\n\n366\n00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.300\nWhat you're saying is,\nI know what I told you, but\n\n367\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.320\nI want you to ignore\nit at least this time.\n\n368\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.870\nThe next time the computer restarts,\nif you don't get back into this boot menu,\n\n369\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.450\nit's gonna go back to the default that\nwe've just seen on the last screen.\n\n370\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:10.270\nSo, many different ways, if you will,\nthat you can, configure where you're\n\n371\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.940\ngonna boot from, what device to check,\nand also how I'm gonna get in there.\n\n372\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.570\nAnd, I think that's great.\n\n373\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.310\nYou have the flexibility to tell them,\nI'm gonna push this key,\n\n374\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.420\nI'm not gonna push this key.\n\n375\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.790\nSometimes you don't have that option.\n\n376\n00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.960\n>> Yeah, probably one of\nthe most commonly frequented area\n\n377\n00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.120\nof the bio-system is what\nwe're looking right here.\n\n378\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.680\nThe boot order, I need to say all right,\n\n379\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.090\nI don't want you to boot to the hard\ndrive just yet, because I've got a DVD\n\n380\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.780\nin the drive and it's up-bootable and\nI want you to boot to that.\n\n381\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.330\nI've got a flash drive\nstuck in the USB and\n\n382\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.070\nI need you to boot to the others and\non there that's bootable.\n\n383\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.560\nAnd that's where I need you to go.\n\n384\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.905\nSo, being able to come in here and say,\nokay, that's what I need you to do.\n\n385\n00:20:46.905 --> 00:20:49.140\nThat's why we use it quite a bit,\n\n386\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.860\nbecause as techs, we're always installing\noperating systems, we're always\n\n387\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.740\nbooting to some sort of disc for\nrepair purposes or things of that nature.\n\n388\n00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.300\nAnd we have to set these devices to do\nthat, because they normally they can, and\n\n389\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.280\nas they should,\nthey look at the hard drive for\n\n390\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.410\nus because that's normally\nwhere an operating system lies.\n\n391\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.250\nBut from time to time,\n\n392\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.525\nas these computers enter our offices and\nthey say, something's wrong with this guy.\n\n393\n00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:12.785\nI don't know what's going on here.\n\n394\n00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:16.925\nWell we're gonna pull out our disk\nutilities, our flash drives with utilities\n\n395\n00:21:16.925 --> 00:21:19.535\non them, and we're probably gonna\nstart booting to things like that.\n\n396\n00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:24.345\nSo coming in here is one of the major\nreasons I get into the BIOS system at all,\n\n397\n00:21:24.345 --> 00:21:25.215\nis to do this.\n\n398\n00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:25.915\n>> Yeah.\nIn fact,\n\n399\n00:21:25.915 --> 00:21:28.745\nyou've got in things like\nthe System Center Configuration Manager,\n\n400\n00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:32.385\nyou can manage imaging your machines\nfrom a centralized location.\n\n401\n00:21:32.385 --> 00:21:35.060\nAnd I always wondered,\nwell how do you do that?\n\n402\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.350\nHow do you tell the operating system that\nI'm gonna boot to the network adapter?\n\n403\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.120\nAnd it's kinda interesting,\nSECM will install a little\n\n404\n00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.500\nagent that you're gonna have to do what\nthey call a light touch installation and\n\n405\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.860\nhit that one-time boot\nmenu to go to it first.\n\n406\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.420\nBut then it installs that and\n\n407\n00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.100\nit can actually, during the early portions\nof the boot process, it can call out and\n\n408\n00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.690\nboot to the network, and\nyou can point it to its operating system.\n\n409\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.130\nSo there's nothing better\nthan a centralized location.\n\n410\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.070\nYou have 50 computers, it's not set up by\ndefault, you'd have to configure it here.\n\n411\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.650\nWhere you configure that pre-execution\nenvironment, that pixie boot and\n\n412\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.360\nthen wherever your admin is, just pushes\na button and all 50 machines reboot and\n\n413\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.410\nthen next Monday they come in, they have a\nfresh installation of an operating system.\n\n414\n00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:21.155\nEssentially what we've done is a ZTI,\nzero touch installation, set it and\n\n415\n00:22:21.155 --> 00:22:21.965\nforget it, walk away.\n\n416\n00:22:21.965 --> 00:22:25.295\nCome back in Monday, hopefully the network\ndidn't fail, and we're good to go.\n\n417\n00:22:25.295 --> 00:22:27.785\nOne last thing that I\nprobably wanna mention her,\n\n418\n00:22:27.785 --> 00:22:31.065\nis you'll see on this screen\nthat there's some changes.\n\n419\n00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:35.092\nNow in all the different configurations,\nI really didn't change anything.\n\n420\n00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:38.295\n[LAUGH] We say BIOS is stored in memory,\n\n421\n00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:40.135\nthough it doesn't have\na good memory apparently.\n\n422\n00:22:40.135 --> 00:22:42.865\nBecause, the moment you make\na modification, even if you change it back\n\n423\n00:22:42.865 --> 00:22:45.105\nto the original setting, it's saying,\nhey, something has changed.\n\n424\n00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:50.570\nSo If you haven't modified anything,\nyou probably are gonna go ahead and\n\n425\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.030\nescape, and when you do you're gonna\nescape without saving the settings.\n\n426\n00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.070\nSo just be careful, cuz if you discard the\nsettings and you have modified something,\n\n427\n00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.170\nyou might go back to the drawing board and\ngo all the way back to step one and have\n\n428\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.430\nto go through all these configurations and\nthat can definitely be a problem.\n\n429\n00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.650\nAnd that's only a single machine.\n\n430\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.330\nIf you're doing this to 50 machines, you\nmight have a long day at the office, or\n\n431\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.780\nmaybe even a long weekend.\n\n432\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.000\n>> That's for sure.\n\n433\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.630\nAll right, Wes,\n\n434\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.830\nis there anything else we need to\ncover before we close this show up?\n\n435\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.680\nNo, just again I've got to\nreiterate on firmware BIOS updates,\n\n436\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.850\nbe careful when you update a bios.\n\n437\n00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.400\nDo not do it during a lightning storm or\nwhere there is any potential to\n\n438\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.800\nlose power, cause you could\npermanently ruin your machine.\n\n439\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.990\nAnd there's nothing worst\nthan spending all that money,\n\n440\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.910\nall that time getting here,\npermanently ruining a mother board,\n\n441\n00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.880\nand now you're back to\nthe purchasing process.\n\n442\n00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.450\n>> That's right.\n\n443\n00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.556\nVery expensive door stop.\n\n444\n00:23:39.556 --> 00:23:40.217\n>> [LAUGH]. That's right. >> [CROSSTALK].\n\n445\n00:23:40.217 --> 00:23:41.930\nThat's not what we want.\n\n446\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.610\nSo, wise words,\ngood safety tip from Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n447\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.600\nWes, thank you so much for\nthis demonstration today,\n\n448\n00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.500\nwe really appreciate that.\n\n449\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.050\n>> This was fun.\n\n450\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:49.880\n>> Yeah.\nIt was.\n\n451\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.840\nAnd we thank you guys for watching.\n\n452\n00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.170\nWell I guess we're going to go ahead and\nclose down this episode.\n\n453\n00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.880\nSo signing off for I.T. Pro T.V.\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n454\n00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.740\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n",
