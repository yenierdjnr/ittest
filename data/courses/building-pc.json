ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.650\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrey, joining me\ntoday is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.930\nHow's it going today Mr. Wes?.\n\n5\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.490\n>> It's going great, it's good to be here.\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.800\nGood to be back with the ITProTV crew\nhere and, we got a really fun show today.\n\n7\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.280\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout building computers.\n\n8\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.480\nAnd one of the things that we're gonna do\nin this episode is we're gonna try to set\n\n9\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.750\nthe stage for well what do you\nneed to put together, a list.\n\n10\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.510\nWe're gonna develop our shopping list and\nget our components ready to go.\n\n11\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.770\nAnd we're gonna set a budget,\nwe're gonna find out.\n\n12\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.390\nHow close we can get to that budget.\n\n13\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.570\nIf we have a couple thousand dollars,\nwe have $5,000 out, well guess what?\n\n14\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.990\nI don't really think we have a problem\n>> [LAUGHS]\n\n15\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.650\n>> on what we want to build.\n\n16\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.470\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n17\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.450\nNot everybody just has money to\njust keep throwing out there.\n\n18\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.675\nAt least,\nI don't know about you Dan I know I don't.\n\n19\n00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:04.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm poor.\n\n20\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.140\n>> Right, so, hopefully one of the things\nthat we can do today is help you guys\n\n21\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.270\nwhen you come away from this show knowing\na little bit of the method to the madness.\n\n22\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.060\nDeveloping a list, setting a budget, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.960\nseeing how close we can get to that budget\nwhen it comes to building a computer.\n\n24\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.460\n>> That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.798\nWe're gonna kinda operate under\nthe assumption that we're a couple of\n\n26\n00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:26.411\ncomputer techs, or\nmaybe you're a self employed guy,\n\n27\n00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:29.208\nyou're trying to get into the field and\ndo stuff like that.\n\n28\n00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:33.772\nBuilding custom PCs for people is\ntypically a job that newbies get into and\n\n29\n00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:37.905\nit's a great one, because it allows\nyou to work with components.\n\n30\n00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.269\nYou start understanding what's out there,\nwhat's available for\n\n31\n00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:45.570\nthe customer market and working with\nequipment, giving you some real hands on.\n\n32\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.580\nSo, that's one of the reasons\nwe wanted to do this show.\n\n33\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.490\nNow, as Wes said there's some\npre-planning that's gonna go along.\n\n34\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.100\nWe are gonna set a budget for ourselves,\nit's not gonna be gargantuan.\n\n35\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.002\nWin, but\nit's not going to be a pittance either.\n\n36\n00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.870\nWe're gonna make sure that\nit's mid to the road,\n\n37\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.910\nmake sure there's a little bit\nof money in the kitty, for\n\n38\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.560\nus to pick out some components,\nand try to meet that mark.\n\n39\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.841\nNow Wes, obviously we've got our budget.\n\n40\n00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:09.919\nWhere did we set our budget at?\n\n41\n00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.169\n>> We set our budget\nat around 700 to $800.\n\n42\n00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.465\nAt first Dan and I were talking, we're\nlike, we're going to go for $700, and\n\n43\n00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.325\nthen I was thinking.\n\n44\n00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:19.710\nWell, we might need a little cushion.\n\n45\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.441\nBecause if I'm spending money, you always\nhave in your minds eye what you're\n\n46\n00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.462\ngonna go for, but\nsometimes it doesn't happen.\n\n47\n00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:31.770\nSo we're gonna say 700 to $800 range\nhere and we're gonna look at some of\n\n48\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.168\nthe components that we have to put into\nthat case, and some of the requirements.\n\n49\n00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:41.175\nNow if you're the average end-user you\nknow you might save some money if you're\n\n50\n00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:46.048\njust gonna buy it outright from an OEM,\nor original equipment manufacturer.\n\n51\n00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:50.410\nBut one of the great things about building\nyour own and having it customized for you,\n\n52\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.130\nis you can tailor make it\na little more to your needs.\n\n53\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.600\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n54\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.908\n>> Awesome, so I guess, where do we begin?\n\n55\n00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:57.758\nWe've got our budget.\n\n56\n00:02:57.758 --> 00:02:58.860\n>> That's right.\n\n57\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.696\n>> We know we don't need\nthe top of the line,\n\n58\n00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:03.017\nwe know we don't want\nthe bargain basement either.\n\n59\n00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.600\nWe need that mid range, so\nnow, where do we start?\n\n60\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.218\nWhat's the first component\nwe should tackle?\n\n61\n00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:07.921\n>> That's right.\n\n62\n00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:11.740\nWell, you need a place to store all the\ncomponents that are gonna be in the system\n\n63\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.116\nunit, right, the system unit.\n\n64\n00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:16.341\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly, so with the system unit,\n\n65\n00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.740\nit holds everything together, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.530\nOur system unit,\none of the major components\n\n67\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.080\nthat are part of the system unit is\nsomething known as a case or a tower.\n\n68\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.070\nYou might hear many different terms,\nchassis, case, tower.\n\n69\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.440\nSo, don't let any of\nthose terms confuse you.\n\n70\n00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.470\nJust remember that some places might\ncall it a little bit different,\n\n71\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.979\nprimarily what we talk about is the tower.\n\n72\n00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.738\nNow, when it comes to\nthe tower there are some very,\n\n73\n00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:43.318\nvery important things\nthat you got to consider.\n\n74\n00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:47.020\nOne of the first things we got to\nconsider is something called form factor.\n\n75\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.720\nNow form factor for us typically\ndescribes the size of the case and\n\n76\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.000\nmore importantly what kind of\nmotherboard we can put in the case.\n\n77\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.780\nSo thatâ€™s one of the first things\nthat you want to start out with.\n\n78\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.660\nNow when it comes to the form factor,\n\n79\n00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.340\nyou can also have what is known as\nthe mid-range or the full tower.\n\n80\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.718\nNow the full tower,\nyou've got to be careful.\n\n81\n00:04:08.718 --> 00:04:10.553\nIt might be the size of\na small refrigerator.\n\n82\n00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:14.470\nSo if you're storing your components,\nhow big is your desk?\n\n83\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.160\nYou really have to consider:\ndo I have a lot of space?\n\n84\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.740\nIf I have a lot of space, well then, I\ncould probably go with a full size tower.\n\n85\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.230\nMaybe space is a little bit limited,\n\n86\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.070\nand if it is you can reduce that\ndown to even a midsize tower.\n\n87\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.010\nMaybe you don't have any space at all and\n\n88\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.230\nthen you're going to go even smaller form\nfactor of what's known as a slimline case.\n\n89\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.952\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nhit middle of the road here.\n\n90\n00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:41.950\nWe're gonna say we're not going to go for\nthe refrigerator size computer and\n\n91\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.780\nat the same time we're not gonna go for\nthe matchbox size computer.\n\n92\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.640\nI think one of the best mid range form\nfactors is gonna be something known\n\n93\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.550\nas your midsize ATXK.\n\n94\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.080\nSo it's one that's very important for us.\n\n95\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.250\nNow when you're considering buying a case\n\n96\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.570\nthere are some characteristics\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n97\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.580\nFor instance how many hard\ndrives can you store in this.\n\n98\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.306\nNow again we're not gonna go with a gaming\ncase where we have to have a gazillion\n\n99\n00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:10.955\ndrives, and that'd be awesome.\n\n100\n00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:14.090\nBut you also gotta think\nabout things like expansion.\n\n101\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.698\nSo if I start out with a case that\nonly has maybe two hard drive bays,\n\n102\n00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:21.510\nwell I'm kinda limited as to what I\ncan do potentially in the future.\n\n103\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.530\nSo we have to make sure that we get\na case that has enough drive bays for it.\n\n104\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.300\nWe need to make sure that what kinda\n\n105\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.770\noptical drives we might need\nto put into this machine.\n\n106\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.989\nAre we gonna have one that's DVD,\nmaybe one that's Blu-ray.\n\n107\n00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:36.361\nAre we gonna have a combo?\n\n108\n00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.629\nBecause that's the difference between\nhaving enough of the five and a half inch\n\n109\n00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.180\nbays that optical drives typically\nstay in, versus not having enough.\n\n110\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.710\nSo some good considerations there.\n\n111\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.330\nOne of the things you also have to\nconsider too, if you're gonna buy a case.\n\n112\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.140\nDo I need any front panel connectors,\nin the positioning of those connectors?\n\n113\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.220\nSome people, they put their case right\nnext to them where their work station is,\n\n114\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.270\nand they like top mounted IO ports.\n\n115\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.840\nMaybe to be able to plug in a headset\nto the top of the case rather than\n\n116\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.630\nhaving to fumble down and\nplug it down into the bottom of the case.\n\n117\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.280\nSo that might really be something\nyou have to consider as well.\n\n118\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.400\nSometimes you can even get them\nwith ESATA ports on the top.\n\n119\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.450\nIf I've got an extra laptop drive\nthat I'm not using anymore,\n\n120\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.740\nI can just plug it right in.\n\n121\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.010\nAnd I can use it as an external drive.\n\n122\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.020\nI would say probably one thing that you\nalso have to consider is power supplies.\n\n123\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.470\nIs the power supply gonna\nbe part of the case or not.\n\n124\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.960\nSo, one of the things that we're going\nto do here is, let's go ahead and\n\n125\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.470\nmaybe take a look at some cases,\nmaybe do some comparison here.\n\n126\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.095\nSo, we've gone and kinda done some\nof the research ahead of time.\n\n127\n00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:51.175\nTo try to help just ease the burden of all\nof the research you have to do for this.\n\n128\n00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:53.355\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:56.955\nI've got our computer case\npulled up here on the screen.\n\n130\n00:06:56.955 --> 00:07:01.420\nNow, one of the things that you\nwant to do, do your research.\n\n131\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.190\nYou can go to many different places here.\n\n132\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.980\nI've got one pulled up, again kind\nof doing that research beforehand.\n\n133\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.210\nI've also got one here.\n\n134\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.030\nTiger direct too.\n\n135\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.660\nSo you do have a couple of options, but\none of the first things you want to do\n\n136\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.772\nis you want to look at\nthe specifications of the case.\n\n137\n00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:19.110\n>> Good idea.\nWhen it comes to cases like we've been\n\n138\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.440\nkinda hinting toward.\n\n139\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.340\nYou need enough room inside\nto put all your components if\n\n140\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.270\nyou're gonna have some massive gaming\nrig that's super awesome, gigantic,\n\n141\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.500\ncrazy video cards that you can buy and\nI've seen them there.\n\n142\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.840\nThey have their own fans and\nheatsinks and everything.\n\n143\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.120\nYou're going to need room for that, right?\n\n144\n00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.686\nSo buying the correct case for what your\napplication is, is kind of important.\n\n145\n00:07:39.686 --> 00:07:43.172\nNow Wes you talked a little bit at the\nbeginning when we were jumping into this\n\n146\n00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:43.946\ncase business.\n\n147\n00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:45.485\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> About form factors.\n\n148\n00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.115\nDifferent types of motherboards as well.\n\n149\n00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:48.215\n>> Yep.\n>> Also has to make sure\n\n150\n00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:49.595\nit fits the right motherboard, right?\n\n151\n00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:50.565\n>> That's, that's right too.\n\n152\n00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:54.084\nSo, for instance, the case that I have\nright here, the one that I've picked out.\n\n153\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:56.793\nAnd I've got a couple, so\nI'm not just picking on one vendor.\n\n154\n00:07:56.793 --> 00:07:58.126\nYou might have a vendor\nout there you like.\n\n155\n00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:59.169\nThis is New Egg, great vendor.\n\n156\n00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.876\nWe got another one here.\n\n157\n00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.626\nFor TigerDirect.\n\n158\n00:08:02.626 --> 00:08:07.716\nNow notice they've got some of\nthe same specifications and\n\n159\n00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:15.090\nthe specification I want you to look at\nhere is Standard ATX, microATX, Mini-ITX.\n\n160\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.250\nIf I switch on over to the other\none that we've looked at,\n\n161\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.030\nwell, they've only got one ATX,\nbut what does that mean for us?\n\n162\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.060\nWell, the ATX form factor has\ndiffered throughout the years.\n\n163\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.520\nSo you have to be very very mindful of\nwhat motherboard form factor you're gonna\n\n164\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.330\nget, because three of the form factors\nthat have to match in any computer build.\n\n165\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.470\nWe've already mentioned one.\n\n166\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.360\nThe case is very important cuz\neverything has to fit inside the case.\n\n167\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.320\nBut then the second factor that's\ncoming up here is the motherboard.\n\n168\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.290\nThe case and the motherboard have to\nmatch, because if you get one of these\n\n169\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.720\ngiant motherboards and you try to put\nit into this little top set like box,\n\n170\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.730\nwell, obviously,\nyou're not gonna break out the hammer and\n\n171\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.800\ntry to break that thing in there and\ndo any customizations.\n\n172\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.000\nSo, I have to make sure that\nif I've got a ATX case,\n\n173\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.640\nin this case you can see some\nof the specifications behind it.\n\n174\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.400\nDoes it have what I need?\n\n175\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.290\nWell, it's got three, oh,\nfive and a quarter inch base.\n\n176\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.180\nIt looks like this one has, what is it?\n\n177\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.510\nThree and a half inch base,\nwhich are internal drives.\n\n178\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.810\nAnd this one even\nsupports solid state too.\n\n179\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.120\nSo you can see those 2.5 inch drive bays.\n\n180\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.560\nNow, I have to get a motherboard\nthat matches the same thing.\n\n181\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.545\nI've gone ahead and\n\n182\n00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:28.640\nI've picked a motherboard that you can\nsee has the Micro ATX form factor.\n\n183\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.270\nNow here's the thing\nthat I have to consider,\n\n184\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.580\nis the Micro ATX gonna fit in this case?\n\n185\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.860\nWell if we went with this case,\n\n186\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.560\nwe might run into a problem cuz\nremember it only says ATX here.\n\n187\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.690\nSo if I scroll down and I wanna find out,\ndoes this motherboard have\n\n188\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.740\nthe compatibility with my case or\nvice versa, however you wanna say that.\n\n189\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.020\nOne of the first things I have to\ndo is I have to look right here and\n\n190\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.330\nyou can see this says MICRO ATX.\n\n191\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.400\nAnd ATX here.\n\n192\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.240\nSo looks like this motherboard is going\nto support our case, or vice versa.\n\n193\n00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.960\nOur case is going to\nsupport our motherboard.\n\n194\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.550\nNow, when it comes to your motherboard,\nthe form factor is absolutely critical.\n\n195\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.720\nNow, in relationship to your case, a lot\nof times when you see these multiple form\n\n196\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.750\nfactor names in the list, it's because\nthey have different mounting points.\n\n197\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.549\nSo you don't have to worry about, it's\nnot certainly a one size fits all, but\n\n198\n00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:26.620\nyou can fit different form\nfactors inside there.\n\n199\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.923\nThe other thing I think about when I think\nabout a motherboard is going to be how\n\n200\n00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:33.320\nmany hard drive connections does it have?\n\n201\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.460\nDoes it have video support?\n\n202\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.910\nDoes it have sound support?\n\n203\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.828\nBut I can tell you one of the first things\nthat we really need to know here is this\n\n204\n00:10:42.828 --> 00:10:47.460\nwhole concept of what family,\nwhat product line are we going to go with?\n\n205\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.640\nAnd for us today there's really\ntwo major product lines.\n\n206\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.640\nAnd that product line is either going\nto be Intel or it's going to be AMD.\n\n207\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.080\nNow, when it comes to that,\nthat's going to be your choice.\n\n208\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.510\nSome people like Intel and\nare going to stick with Intel.\n\n209\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.510\nSome people like AMD and\nthey're gonna stick with AMD.\n\n210\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.760\nAnd that is one of the most crucial\nthings, I would say if you're gonna start\n\n211\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.610\nwith a motherboard, you have to know\nwell what product line am I gonna get,\n\n212\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.610\nbecause in some of the other components\nthat we talk about they have to match.\n\n213\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.860\nYou can't mix and match.\n\n214\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.690\nSo knowing whether you're going to go with\nAMD or you're going to go with Intel,\n\n215\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.680\nis going to be one of the first\nthings that you want to discuss.\n\n216\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.913\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then don't forget,\n\n217\n00:11:27.913 --> 00:11:29.490\nyou got to cool the stinking things.\n\n218\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.920\nWhether you're an AMD fan or\nyou're an Intel fan, great.\n\n219\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.905\nWave that flag as hard as you like.\n\n220\n00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.497\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you want to make sure that a case\n\n221\n00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:39.070\nstays cool, because if you don't\nit's going to burn the thing up and\n\n222\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.725\nit's going to be a useless hunk of brick.\n\n223\n00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:42.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's not what we want.\n\n224\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.010\nSo cooling is also an important\nfactor when it comes into\n\n225\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.090\nwhich motherboard you actually choose.\n\n226\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.560\nAnd also the case that you bought.\n\n227\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.020\nHow are we gonna get,\nis it gonna be a large cooling device?\n\n228\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.860\nIs it gonna be a small?\n\n229\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.790\nAnd Wes, actually there's\nquite a few different types of\n\n230\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.230\ncooling systems that you can run into.\n\n231\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.760\n>> There is.\n\n232\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.280\nThere is.\n\n233\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.635\nNow, again depending on what you're\ngonna do with the overall build,\n\n234\n00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:06.890\nit's really gonna dictate which one of\nthese cooling options you're gonna have.\n\n235\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.120\nSee when you buy your case,\nsometimes not all the time, but\n\n236\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.670\nsometimes you might have some\nfans included in the case.\n\n237\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.440\nOne of the things that usually happens\nis when you buy a CPU it typically\n\n238\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.630\ncomes with a heat sic, just a metal\nblock that sits on top of the CPU.\n\n239\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.710\nAnd for the most part if you're\nnot applying more voltage,\n\n240\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.760\nyou're not trying to get extra performance\nand pump more electrical current into that\n\n241\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.850\nCPU than what it's generally rated at,\nyou should be good with a stock cooling.\n\n242\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.650\nNow, if you want to go a little\nbit farther than this,\n\n243\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.940\nif you want to go overboard on it,\na little bit more advanced of a set up,\n\n244\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.530\nyou could go with something\nlike liquid cooling.\n\n245\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.720\nNow, with a liquid cooling, it is fun,\nbut I will tell you something,\n\n246\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.060\nI have always had a problem with\nshould I take an electrical component,\n\n247\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.470\nand run a liquid across that?\n\n248\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.080\n>> Yeah, it's definitely something\nthat would probably cross the mind\n\n249\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.820\nof an average person of\nmoderate intelligence.\n\n250\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.470\nWe understand that electricity and\nwater, not the best of friends,\n\n251\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.570\nwhen it comes to things we want to buy and\nkeep running.\n\n252\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.830\nIf you get the two mixed together, well\nyou're gonna have yourself another brick.\n\n253\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.440\nAnd maybe even a fire, oh that'll be fun.\n\n254\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.040\nNo it won't be fun.\n\n255\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.520\nBut liquid cooling it's come a long way,\n\n256\n00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.082\nit's not like you're just hosing in some\nfish tank pipes in there, all right Wes.\n\n257\n00:13:22.082 --> 00:13:23.050\n>> Hopefully.\n[LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.340\n>> They kind of look like radiators\n\n259\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.040\nto be honest with you.\n\n260\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.770\n>> They really do.\n\n261\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.470\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n262\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.590\nlet's take the time to look at\nsome of these cooling options.\n\n263\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.500\nBecause, you have a lot of options out\nthere and which one you go with is\n\n264\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.330\nreally gonna be based on your knowledge,\nyour skill level as a tech.\n\n265\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.957\nBecause some of the liquid\ncooling systems,\n\n266\n00:13:38.957 --> 00:13:42.920\nthey can be, they can come in\na lot of parts if you will.\n\n267\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.340\nIf you don't know those individual parts,\nit could be a little difficult.\n\n268\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.320\nSo here we've got many different options.\n\n269\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.580\nYou can see some air coolers here,\nsome water and liquid coolers.\n\n270\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:58.910\nIf you are an entry-level technician,\nmaybe you wanna try using liquid cool.\n\n271\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.140\nCorsair makes some good ones here\nthat are all self contained systems.\n\n272\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.380\nSo you don't have to put the liquid in.\n\n273\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.100\nYou don't have to screw down\nthe water blocks, any of the water\n\n274\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.820\nblocks that are across the chip set,\nand it's relatively easy.\n\n275\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.450\nIt's a good entry level type\nof liquid cooling system.\n\n276\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.970\nNow you can go, certainly,\n\n277\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.640\nas extravagant as you want based\non whatever your price point is.\n\n278\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.670\nLet's see here, there's another one.\n\n279\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.750\nThat one looks like it's\nan all internal system.\n\n280\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.710\nThere we go, so there's another one here.\n\n281\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.800\nAnd again you can look at\nthe specifications there.\n\n282\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.640\nAnd there we go.\n\n283\n00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.140\n>> Looks like what's in my car.\n\n284\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.990\n>> Yes that's exactly it,\nwell Dan made a good point,\n\n285\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.540\nit's like these look a lot\nlike radiators right.\n\n286\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.280\nWell, that's exactly what they're doing,\n\n287\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.170\nthey're taking this whatever\nthe liquid is inside of them and\n\n288\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.160\nit's trying to dissipate that heat\noff of whatever it's cooling.\n\n289\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.940\nCuz it could cool the CPU,\ncould cool the memory, and\n\n290\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.420\nthen pass it through a radiator, and\nthat process just keeps continuing here.\n\n291\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.970\nSo again,\ndepending on the complexity of the build,\n\n292\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.190\nit's really gonna tell you which one of\nthese cooling solutions you're gonna use.\n\n293\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.580\nAll in ones are very good if\nyou are just starting out,\n\n294\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.660\nhowever if you wanna get a bit\nfarther than that, you can.\n\n295\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.150\nYou also have the option too to when it\ncomes to cooling, is buying cases fans.\n\n296\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.420\nNow when you buy a case fan,\nyou have certain common sizes,\n\n297\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.340\nyou have what are known as 80 millimeter,\nthe 20 millimeter and\n\n298\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.140\neven some of the 250 millimeter fans too.\n\n299\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.600\nYou can see some other shapes here\nas well, like 140 millimeter.\n\n300\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.369\nNow, one of the things you want to keep\nin mind when you're talking about buying\n\n301\n00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:35.069\na cooling system,\nsee if it's a liquid cooling system,\n\n302\n00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:37.650\nwe don't really have to worry about noise.\n\n303\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.730\nNo noise at all.\n\n304\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.530\nAll right.\n\n305\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.750\nBut if you're buying your fans,\n\n306\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.020\nyou definitely have to worry\nabout how loud they are,\n\n307\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.200\nespecially if you start the case up and\nit sounds like a helicopter taking off.\n\n308\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.100\nSo, pay attention to which\nfans your case takes.\n\n309\n00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.830\nYour CPU typically comes with a fan.\n\n310\n00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.870\nAnd if you're not doing\nthings like over-clocking,\n\n311\n00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.850\nmost often the stock cooling\nsystem will be just fine.\n\n312\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.770\n>> So then we've got to motherboards,\nright?\n\n313\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.958\nThat's where we're at.\n\n314\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.668\nWe've got a processor for it,\nwe've got a cooling system for that.\n\n315\n00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:05.950\nWe gotta take that into account.\n\n316\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.808\nAlso wanna take into account,\n\n317\n00:16:07.808 --> 00:16:12.459\nsometimes Motherboards will come with\non board things like video and sound.\n\n318\n00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:16.820\nAnd that might be a good way to go,\nit can do some advantageous things for us.\n\n319\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.960\nWe can also make sure that we get it\nlarge enough, with enough expansion slots\n\n320\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.350\nto add in those video or\nsound if that's the way we're gonna go.\n\n321\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.115\nBut again, it's all gonna come back to\nthat, oh, what does the customer need.\n\n322\n00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:30.140\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> Versus what we have available.\n\n323\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.190\n>> And what the price point is.\n\n324\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:31.900\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly.\n\n325\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.410\nSo, for instance, if your customer\nplans on trying to keep this for\n\n326\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.065\na couple of years of not being\noutdated like the proverbial computer\n\n327\n00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:44.235\nusually is outdated in six months,\nand then you might\n\n328\n00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:47.765\nwant to make sure that you have also\nroom for additional expansion too.\n\n329\n00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:51.700\nAnd that'll all be in the specifications\nof the motherboard itself, again,\n\n330\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.344\nif you're maybe trying to price cut\na little bit here you can go with the on\n\n331\n00:16:55.344 --> 00:16:56.000\nboard video.\n\n332\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.410\nBut if you're gonna do any kind of video\nrendering that might not be feasible,\n\n333\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.610\nso you might have to add\nthat extra video capability.\n\n334\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.220\nThe same thing goes with your sound.\n\n335\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.680\nOne of the other things\nto keep in mind though,\n\n336\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.060\nI want to get back to though\nis those adapter slots.\n\n337\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.640\nDepending on how much expansion you wanna\ndo in the future, pay attention to that,\n\n338\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.210\ncuz that could be a deal breaker.\n\n339\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.210\nI know when I was buying my\ngigabyte board at the house,\n\n340\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.000\nI had looked at another board and\nit only had two PCIE slot.\n\n341\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.255\nWell, I needed three, I can't\nremember exactly what I was doing but\n\n342\n00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:28.785\nI needed three.\n\n343\n00:17:28.785 --> 00:17:33.265\nThree is better than one or two, so, for\nthat board it was the perfect price.\n\n344\n00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:36.445\nEverything was set up exactly\nthe way I wanted, except for\n\n345\n00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:39.355\nthat there, so that was the deal\nbreaker on the motherboard,\n\n346\n00:17:39.355 --> 00:17:42.150\nso make sure that you have room for\nexpansion.\n\n347\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.920\n>> Yeah, I tend to be under\nthe philosophy of, I'd rather have it and\n\n348\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.760\nnot need it than need it and\nnot have it if I can get away with that.\n\n349\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.500\nAnd so,\n\n350\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.650\nyou gotta take into account maybe one day,\nI will want that extra expansion slot.\n\n351\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:58.200\nSo, if you have the money and you can go\nfor a board that has more expansion slots,\n\n352\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.380\nthat might be a good idea,\njust forward thinking.\n\n353\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.780\nNow, that brings us to,\nwe've got motherboard now, right?\n\n354\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.220\nWe understand, we've got the CPU,\ngotta cool it, we have expansion slots.\n\n355\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.840\nMaybe we'll go with some on board sound or\nvideo.\n\n356\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.500\nBut another one of the big components that\nwe're gonna have to really focus in on\n\n357\n00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.840\nis the hard drive.\n\n358\n00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.620\nHow much storage space am I\ngoing to need for this thing?\n\n359\n00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.620\nHow fast do I need that guy to run?\n\n360\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.520\nWhat kind of reliability am I\ngonna go with a RAID array?\n\n361\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.780\nAll sorts of things come into\nmind when it comes to storages.\n\n362\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.580\nInternal, external.\n\n363\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.270\nThis can be very bogging down,\n\n364\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.690\nit can get you spinning your wheels going,\nokay do I want this one?\n\n365\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.660\nOr do I wanna go with that one?\n\n366\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.000\nAgain, a lot of times it's gonna come\ndown to price, what can you afford?\n\n367\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.205\nI always say get the the best product that\nyou can afford that sticks to your budget.\n\n368\n00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:51.679\nDon't go over that, cuz next thing you\nknow, you're nickel and dimming yourself.\n\n369\n00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:54.887\nYou set your budget at $700,\nand now it's $1700.\n\n370\n00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:55.745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You think, well,\n\n371\n00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:59.000\nI only added, you know,\nthese small components.\n\n372\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.340\nThey add up, so be mindful of that,\nespecially if itâ€™s a customerâ€™s build, but\n\n373\n00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.950\nthe hard drive is a place where\nif they want good performance,\n\n374\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.300\nthis is where you might want\nto spend some more money.\n\n375\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.040\n>> Yeah, and\nthatâ€™s a good thing to consider, too,\n\n376\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.940\nis whether youâ€™re going to do\nthe traditional mechanical drive.\n\n377\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.220\nNow, traditional mechanical\ndrives that we talk about,\n\n378\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.470\nthey can usually scale up to\nlarge storage capacities.\n\n379\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.910\nAnd you don't get charged an arm and\na leg for them,\n\n380\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.830\nbut it might reduce a little\nbit of the performance.\n\n381\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.940\nThe other thing to keep in mind is,\nwhat interface?\n\n382\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.040\nAnd it's usually serial ATA\nin the PC environment today,\n\n383\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.980\nbut, how many of those interfaces?\n\n384\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.668\nSo, how many drives does\nthe mother board support?\n\n385\n00:19:37.668 --> 00:19:39.290\nSo, you're gonna notice\na commonality here,\n\n386\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.800\nwhere we keep going back to\nthat mother board, right?\n\n387\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.910\nWell, I need to make sure that if I, yeah.\n\n388\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:50.300\nIt's nice to have four drive base,\neight drive based on your case there.\n\n389\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.250\nBut if the motherboard only has\ntwo drive interfaces cases,\n\n390\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.940\nthen you're pretty much limited.\n\n391\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.170\nThe other consideration might\nbe solid state storage.\n\n392\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.340\nIt's not uncommon today to say hey, I'm\ngonna get a smaller solid state storage\n\n393\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.050\ndevice, and\nmaybe put my operating system on that.\n\n394\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.490\nAnd then turn around and get like one of\nthe traditional mechanical drives for\n\n395\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.200\nthe data that I'm gonna store,\ncuz of the fact that dollar for\n\n396\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.490\ndollar if you're just storing data, you're\ngonna get more of a benefit out of those\n\n397\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.710\ntraditional heart mechanical drives than\nyou will the solid state storage device.\n\n398\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.690\nYou also have to pay\nattention to vendor as well.\n\n399\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.060\nSo one of the things that we do, and you\nknow, quantity is another big thing too.\n\n400\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.030\nIf you are gonna use storage erase,\n\n401\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.140\nif you're gonna use a RAID array like\nthat, now we're getting into a situation.\n\n402\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.450\nDoes the motherboard support RAID?\n\n403\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.030\nAll right.\n\n404\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.060\nOr does, do you have to get\nan additional adapter card?\n\n405\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.850\nIf you have to get an additional adapter\ncard to support the RAID functionality,\n\n406\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.300\nkinda like Dan said, maybe that put us\na couple $100 over what our budget was.\n\n407\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.560\nSo there again, that's something that\nif you're gonna do multiple drives,\n\n408\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.780\njust take a look at the specifications\nof the motherboard and\n\n409\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.120\nsee if it has that\nintegrated functionality.\n\n410\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.910\nIf it doesn't, there again,\nthat might not be the motherboard for you,\n\n411\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.750\nif you truly do need that functionality.\n\n412\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.330\nAverage end user a lot of\ntimes doesn't need this,\n\n413\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.570\nbut again, It's gonna be based\non the customer's needs.\n\n414\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.190\n>> Yeah, Wes,\n\n415\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.020\nit really brings up a really good question\nthat I was sitting here thinking of.\n\n416\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.800\nCapacity, right?\n\n417\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.935\nWe're all like, give me all\nthe space I can get my hands on,\n\n418\n00:21:17.935 --> 00:21:20.340\ncuz Lord knows I'm going to fill it up.\n\n419\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.260\nBut with SSDs, I don't usually\nget as much capacity unless I'm\n\n420\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.660\nwilling to pay gargantuan\namounts of money.\n\n421\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.490\nSo, the question comes in, do I go with\nthe mechanical drive where I don't get\n\n422\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.560\nthe performance that I would with\nthe SSD but I do get the capacity or\n\n423\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.210\nis it worth more the money to go for\nthe performance of the SSD.\n\n424\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.360\nA nice quick speed, everything's\ncoming at me that way I like it.\n\n425\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.610\nWhat's the better of the two?\n\n426\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.700\n>> Well, there again,\nhow much money do you have to spend?\n\n427\n00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.005\nWhat is you're price point?\n\n428\n00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:56.190\nCuz you can even get into trouble when it\ncomes to selecting a solid state drive.\n\n429\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.440\nOne of the things that might be beneficial\nto the end user is to get one of these\n\n430\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.700\nsmaller solid state drives that per gig,\ndollar for dollar, they are fairly cheap.\n\n431\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.930\nToday they are, it certainly wasn't\nthe case a couple years back.\n\n432\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.260\nYou could spend hundreds of\ndollars on even a small SSD,\n\n433\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.340\nso as the solid state drives get\na little bit better if you need\n\n434\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.780\nmaybe performance on some kind of\napplication, if you're running,\n\n435\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.480\ni don't know, the Adobe,\nlike Photoshop or something like that.\n\n436\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.630\nYou need some really good performance,\n\n437\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.930\nthen maybe a smaller solid state drive is\ngonna be good for you, but if you can't\n\n438\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.920\njustify the cost to get the performance,\nthen you can always back up and\n\n439\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.190\nsay you know what I'll just go with what\nwe've been using for a very long time.\n\n440\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.060\nAnd I can get two terabytes for\n\n441\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.820\nhalf of the price of what I got\nsomething that might only be 100 gigs.\n\n442\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.330\n>> Yeah I would say on a budget build.\n\n443\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.380\nProbably the best way to go is a really\nfast mechanical drive cuz you're gonna\n\n444\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.380\nget lots of storage, that's gonna\nnot cost you as much as solid state.\n\n445\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.800\nBut if you still want to go solid\nstate cuz you just, like he said,\n\n446\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.240\nmaybe you're running Photoshop,\nmaybe you're doing audio work or\n\n447\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.150\nvideo rendering, those types of things.\n\n448\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.870\nThis application can really hit\nperformance when it comes to\n\n449\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.620\nthe drive itself.\n\n450\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.030\nSo, go with a small SSD for\nthings like the applications and\n\n451\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.090\nthe operating system and then spend\nthe rest of your money as much storage\n\n452\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.140\nwith a mechanical drives as you can.\n\n453\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.980\nProbably, the best of both worlds, right.\n\n454\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.720\n>> Yeah,\nI've got an older Intel X 25 M and\n\n455\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.990\nit's just a little 80\ngig solid state drive.\n\n456\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.900\nAnd I put my operating system on that.\n\n457\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.450\nI ended up going out and\ngetting a second 80 gig solid state drive,\n\n458\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.210\nyou're saying 80 gigs, man.\n\n459\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.970\nGosh, I got thumb drives that\nare bigger than that today.\n\n460\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.420\nWhat are you using it for?\n\n461\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.440\nI don't put any data on it,\nother than what applications need.\n\n462\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.540\nSo, for instance,\nI use virtualization technology,\n\n463\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.870\nso I put all of my virtual machines\non that second stylus state drive.\n\n464\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:43.100\nBut when it comes to the data like my,\nI don't know videos,\n\n465\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.450\nmy music, that data,\nI don't really access too much.\n\n466\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.420\nAnd it can stand on,\nit can sit on those traditional drives.\n\n467\n00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.050\nAnd the one good thing about\nthe traditional drives is if you're just\n\n468\n00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.610\nstoring your data, you can scale\nup to a very large capacity for\n\n469\n00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.180\na relatively cheap amount today.\n\n470\n00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.750\nYou're drives, like, Western Digital\nCaviar Black editions which is\n\n471\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:07.120\na higher end PC hard drive,\nthey go for 70 bucks.\n\n472\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.730\nSo very easily,\nyou could go up to two to four terabytes.\n\n473\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.690\nIt doesn't cost quite as\nmuch as the solid state.\n\n474\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.410\nBut again,\nif you need the performance solid states,\n\n475\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.580\nit is going to be where it's at.\n\n476\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.500\n>> All right.\nSo what are we going\n\n477\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.900\nto put inside of our computer\nthat we're building today?\n\n478\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.500\n>> We're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna put a, let's see here.\n\n479\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.760\nWe've got a case here,\nthis is the series 200 R Corsair.\n\n480\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:37.180\nI think what we're gonna see here,\nis this LGA Intel gigabyte board.\n\n481\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:43.700\nWe kind of went mid range on the processor\nhere cuz everybody wants the i7.\n\n482\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:50.370\nBut we said, not quite the i7,\nwe're gonna go with the i5 here.\n\n483\n00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.030\nAll right, here's the one that I think\nis going to be best for our build.\n\n484\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.070\nIt's a drive that I've actually used.\n\n485\n00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.729\nAnd this one here is the western\ndigital black series, so you're gonna\n\n486\n00:24:59.729 --> 00:25:04.340\nget moderate amount of performance out of\nthis, it's got the larger cache in it and\n\n487\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.890\nyou know the price isn't too bad either,\nit's only about $70.\n\n488\n00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.270\nSo, you know dollar for dollar,\none terabyte drive here,\n\n489\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.630\n7200 RPM's on the newest interface for\n$70.\n\n490\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.210\nYou really can't beat that, especially\nif you're again, building for a budget.\n\n491\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:19.780\n>> Awesome.\n\n492\n00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.350\n>> Yep.\n\n493\n00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.740\n>> All right, Wes, well, really good\nlooking drive you got there and\n\n494\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.720\nthat's gonna be great for\nour build what we're trying to do.\n\n495\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.100\nAnd you know what, we've got a whole\nlot more that we gotta talk about.\n\n496\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.230\nThere's actually a few more components\nwe wanna stick in this turkey but\n\n497\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.110\nwe've run out of time for this episode.\n\n498\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.020\nSo we're gonna have to make a part two.\n\n499\n00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.770\nWes, I know I'm looking forward to it.\n\n500\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.710\nI can't wait to see what the end price is.\n\n501\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.100\nDid we meet our budget or not?\n\n502\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.870\n>> We're hoping [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.560\n>> Yeah, we are hoping at that.\n\n504\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.500\nHopefully, we'll see you\nguys in part two on that.\n\n505\n00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.400\nBut as for this,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n506\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.370\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Danielle Lawrie.\n\n507\n00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.300\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n508\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:59.520\n>> And we'll see you next time\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",
