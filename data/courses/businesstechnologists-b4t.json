So let's talk about what's\nmost important, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.100\nSo you've got things like your\ncorporate administration.\n\n59\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.040\nYou've got fundraising, you've got\ntechnology and corporate business.\n\n60\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.760\nSo what do those things mean?\n\n61\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.370\nWell, look, when you start a business it's\nnot all, hey I'm gonna go build stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.821\nYou're gonna be doing,\nhey I've gotta do HR, god!\n\n63\n00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:19.738\nBut you've got to do it.\n\n64\n00:03:19.738 --> 00:03:21.103\nYou've got to get your EIN.\n\n65\n00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:23.151\nYou've got to get your\nincorporation paper signed.\n\n66\n00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:26.206\nYou've got to get your licenses if\nyou need them for your state or for\n\n67\n00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.270\nany states you wanna do business in.\n\n68\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.940\nYou've got to protect your\nintellectual property, your IP.\n\n69\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.300\nYou've got to get your stock issued or\nif you're an LLC,\n\n70\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.850\nyour percentages in\nthe company spread out.\n\n71\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.700\nYou've gotta decide,\nam I gonna be a government contractor?\n\n72\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.367\nBecause if you're a government contractor,\nScott,\n\n73\n00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:41.860\nyou're the expert on\ngovernment contracting.\n\n74\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n75\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.940\n&gt;&gt; What are the important pieces\nof ownership of a business for\n\n76\n00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.890\ngovernment contracting?\n\n77\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.690\n&gt;&gt; So there are many different qualifiers\nfor government contracting, Josh, right?\n\n78\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.569\nAnd some of those qualifiers\ncan be a woman-owned business,\n\n79\n00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.628\na small business, minority-owned business,\n\n80\n00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:02.640\nan Alaskan native-owned business, and\na Hawaiian native-owned business.\n\n81\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.530\nThat is something that we're going to\nbe going over in a different talk.\n\n82\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.430\nBut it is very important to understand,\nwhen you're talking about\n\n83\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.950\ncorporate structure, how the business is\nactually owned, run, operated, maintained,\n\n84\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.960\nand moved forward\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back to our slide.\n\n85\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.490\nAnd you'll notice that in all\nof these things, in all four\n\n86\n00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.590\ncategories of what's most important,\ntechnology is just one of the four.\n\n87\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.040\nAnd it only has one thing in it, the idea.\n\n88\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.650\nEverything else has multiple\npieces you've gotta worry about.\n\n89\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.710\nHow do you pay people?\n\n90\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.700\nHow do you talk to people?\n\n91\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.820\nWho's running the office?\n\n92\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.120\nDo you have to pay for Internet?\n\n93\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.010\nWell, I mean normally, right?\n\n94\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.140\nEven if it's at your house,\nyou gotta pay for internet.\n\n95\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.340\nAnd if you pay for\nInternet at your house, and\n\n96\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.590\nyou're running your\noffice out of your house,\n\n97\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.420\nhey, you can actually do a tax deduction.\n\n98\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.420\nBut that's a later talk.\n\n99\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.670\nYou've got to fundraise,\nbecause while you're building this,\n\n100\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.270\nyou've got to have either a job or\nsome money to live off of.\n\n101\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.020\nBecause those magic things called rent and\nmortgage, they don't pay themselves.\n\n102\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat even carries into the team,\n\n103\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.530\nthe implementation, what your sales are.\n\n104\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.150\nBecause let's face it,\nsales are a big thing here, right?\n\n105\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.240\nWhat type of marketing\nyou're using as well.\n\n106\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.429\nSo if you are going after VC funding,\nVCs today, venture capitalists,\n\n107\n00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:18.271\nare gonna say to you,\nI wanna see your sales, right?\n\n108\n00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:19.777\nI wanna see what your margins are.\n\n109\n00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:21.180\nI wanna see what your profits are.\n\n110\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.590\nI wanna see how much it costs to\nmake what your product is, right?\n\n111\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And if you don't have sales,\n\n112\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.310\na lot of VCs are gonna\nactually walk from you, right?\n\n113\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's no traction.\n\n114\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.000\nAnd without traction,\nyou're not getting money.\n\n115\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.760\nIts just that simple these days.\n\n116\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.460\nSo again, that's a later talk.\n\n117\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.900\nBut the point is out of all\nthese categories of things,\n\n118\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.610\nthe technology was only one and\nthat's tough.\n\n119\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.180\nBecause there's so many details\nthat aren't your actual technology,\n\n120\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.970\nthat aren't your actual product.\n\n121\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.740\nThey're the marketing, they're the team,\nthey're everything else but\n\n122\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.630\nit's not the product.\n\n123\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.610\n&gt;&gt; So before we go past all this,\nJoshua, I wanna ask you something.\n\n124\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.390\nOut of the eight items that we have listed\nhere, what would you consider to be\n\n125\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.690\nthe most important number one and\nnumber two item for people to focus on?\n\n126\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.017\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a great question.\n\n127\n00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:15.158\nI will tell you that the number one item\nthat venture capitalists are looking for,\n\n128\n00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:18.350\nand honestly, they're kind of\nthe important ones right now.\n\n129\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.210\nBecause you wanna decide if your company's\ngoing to be a venture capital funded\n\n130\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.410\ncompany or not.\n\n131\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.490\nThey're looking at the team and\nthey're looking at your sales.\n\n132\n00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.886\nIf you have a successfully exited\nentrepreneur, that's a magic term,\n\n133\n00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:32.770\ndon't forget it, a successfully\nexited entrepreneur on your team.\n\n134\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.458\nIf you have a team that has\nproven sales track record,\n\n135\n00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.520\nproven marketing track record.\n\n136\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.020\nIf you have a product that has actually\nmade sales and so you have traction.\n\n137\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.825\nWow, you've got a lot going for you.\n\n138\n00:06:43.825 --> 00:06:47.460\nNotice not once there did I mention you\nhave a great technology, a great idea or\n\n139\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.390\na great prototype.\n\n140\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, okay, so hold on,\n\n141\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.180\nyou're telling me that you have to have\na successful entrepreneur on your team?\n\n142\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.540\nWhat is the key marker of that?\n\n143\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.566\nAnd then we're gonna keep going.\n\n144\n00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:01.558\nBut I just wanna pull this out of you so\n\n145\n00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:05.930\nthat everybody who's watching this\nunderstands what we understand.\n\n146\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.740\n&gt;&gt; So a successfully exited\nentrepreneur is somebody that is,\n\n147\n00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.290\nI mean it's in the name.\n\n148\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.248\nThey've sold a company,\nthey've sold intellectual property,\n\n149\n00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:16.225\nthey've performed a liquidation event,\nas it's known, okay.\n\n150\n00:07:16.225 --> 00:07:19.478\nAnd they've either sold the intellectual\nproperty to a another company,\n\n151\n00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:23.180\nthey've sold the entire company,\nthey've been acqui-hired, whatever.\n\n152\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.073\nThose are all successful exits.\n\n153\n00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:27.467\nExits that involve driving away and\n\n154\n00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:31.227\nstarting another job are not\nsuccessful exits, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:31.227 --> 00:07:36.200\nThose exits are ones that don't add to\nyour sort of cache as an entrepreneur.\n\n156\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.003\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n157\n00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:39.426\n&gt;&gt; But there's all kinds\nof entrepreneurs out there,\n\n158\n00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:41.223\nit's not just successfully exited.\n\n159\n00:07:41.223 --> 00:07:43.800\nAnd so\nlet's get into the cast of characters.\n\n160\n00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good.\n\n161\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.430\nSo understanding the cast of characters is\nvery important for how a business works.\n\n162\n00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.349\nSo you have a couple of them.\n\n163\n00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:53.513\nYou have the noobpreneur, right?.\n\n164\n00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:55.486\n&gt;&gt; Noobpreneur\n&gt;&gt; Noobpreneur, sorry.\n\n165\n00:07:55.486 --> 00:07:57.364\nThe wantrepreneur, right?\n\n166\n00:07:57.364 --> 00:07:59.998\nThe entrepreneur and the successful.\n\n167\n00:07:59.998 --> 00:08:01.205\nEntrepreneur, right?\n\n168\n00:08:01.205 --> 00:08:02.379\n&gt;&gt;

That's such a great book.\n\n241\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.140\n&gt;&gt; And my dad introduced me to it,\nand I've read it,\n\n242\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.450\nprobably every couple of years.\n\n243\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.500\nAnd I'm a voracious reader,\nI probably read a book a week, and\n\n244\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500\nI used to read a book a day, okay?\n\n245\n00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.210\nAnd the fact that I reread Zen and\n\n246\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.920\nthe Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\nevery year or two.\n\n247\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.040\nTells you that I really respect\nthe ideas in this book,\n\n248\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.390\nand every time I read it I\nget something more out of it.\n\n249\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.100\nBut one of the interesting\nthings he said was, for\n\n250\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.940\nevery fact there's\nan infinity of hypotheses.\n\n251\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:47.770\nHe actually had a student go, who is\nbright but just not creative at all and\n\n252\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.040\nhe told her write about the town we're in,\nthey were somewhere in Montana, I think.\n\n253\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.182\nAnd she just couldn't think\nof a way to start the essay.\n\n254\n00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:57.540\nSo he said, okay, go down to Main Street,\nsit at the cafe and\n\n255\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.870\nlook at the movie house across the street.\n\n256\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.840\nShe couldn't think of a way\nto start the essay, he said,\n\n257\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.430\nstart with the brick in\nthe upper left corner.\n\n258\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.010\nShe said, what?\nHe said, write about the brick.\n\n259\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.550\nShe goes what's a brick?\n\n260\n00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.933\nHe goes, just look at it and\nstart writing about it.\n\n261\n00:12:09.933 --> 00:12:13.080\nAnd she said, by the time I got to the\nthird brick, I just couldn't stop writing.\n\n262\n00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.310\nIt was a 3 page essay he had required\nher to write, she turned in a 50 page.\n\n263\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.870\nShe couldn't stop by the time\nshe got to the third brick.\n\n264\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.410\nIdeas happen, everybody, all the time.\n\n265\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.290\nAny time you open yourself up to ideas,\nyou go crazy.\n\n266\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.720\nWe thought of two different companies and\nideas on the way down here to Florida, and\n\n267\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.010\nthrew them out because they\nwere worthless and bad ideas.\n\n268\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.470\nBut we thought of them on the trip.\n\n269\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, but the most important\nthing is that, you catalog the ideas.\n\n270\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.160\nYou never, ever know when you're gonna\nbe in the right place at the right time\n\n271\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.290\nto exact an idea, right?\n\n272\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.460\nBut, the real difficult part\nis moving the idea forward.\n\n273\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.810\nDevelopment, development is expensive,\nit is very expensive.\n\n274\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.140\nIt is one of the biggest cash burns that\nyou will every face as an entrepeneur.\n\n275\n00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.800\n&gt;&gt; Especially these days, when developers\nmove out to Silicon Valley and\n\n276\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.610\nmake a salary that is pretty impressive.\n\n277\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.060\nMind you, they live in a closet the size\nof this laptop because of the real estate\n\n278\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.230\ncosts in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n279\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.960\nBut yeah, they're hard to find,\nthey know how much they're worth.\n\n280\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.530\nDevelopment is expensive,\nimplementation is hard.\n\n281\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.460\nYou've got so\nmany details that have to come together,\n\n282\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.570\njust the right time, just the right way.\n\n283\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.720\nProject management is not as\neasy as everybody thinks it is.\n\n284\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.210\nIt is actually a very, very highly skilled\nskill set, it is difficult, it is tough.\n\n285\n00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.320\nA good project manager,\nworth their weight in gold.\n\n286\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.168\n&gt;&gt; So if you're looking at the triangle,\nright, of good, cheap, hard, right?\n\n287\n00:13:40.168 --> 00:13:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Good, cheap, fast.\n\n288\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Good, cheap, fast,\nright, you'd pick two.\n\n289\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:50.170\nImplementation, good implementation\nis both hard and expensive.\n\n290\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.960\n&gt;&gt; And slow.\n\n291\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Very slow, yeah.\n\n292\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.429\n&gt;&gt; It's difficult to do it right.\n\n293\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.950\nSo if everybody's got ideas,\nthey're incredibly common,\n\n294\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.380\nI said as common as belly buttons,\neverybody's got one.\n\n295\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.840\nAnd half the time everybody's\ngot a dozen ideas.\n\n296\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.890\nI've got these great ideas,\nthey'd make a billion dollars each,\n\n297\n00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.090\nif only I could figure out\nhow to implement them.\n\n298\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.180\nWell that's the problem, implementation\nis not easy, it takes devotion,\n\n299\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.120\nit takes effort, it takes a lot of\nskills that you build up over the years.\n\n300\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.050\nIt takes almost an encyclopedic\nsynthesist, somebody who has so\n\n301\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.160\nmany different skills.\n\n302\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.540\nBecause remember,\n\n303\n00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.450\nwhen you're in a startup,\nthe first person you hire is yourself.\n\n304\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.890\nYou've got to able to do HR,\nyou've got to be able to do incorporation,\n\n305\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.820\nyou've to be able to\ndo all sort of things.\n\n306\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.320\nThat first person is really gotta be\npretty solid and pretty multiskilled.\n\n307\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.290\nSo, a good idea, however, a good idea,\n\n308\n00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.330\none that could lead to a successful\nbusiness, proposes a solution.\n\n309\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.290\nHere's a problem, I have a solution.\n\n310\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.770\nNow, does that matter?\n\n311\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.150\nYes, but does it matter a lot?\n\n312\n00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:55.360\nWell, it might, if a lot of people\nare spending money on that problem,\n\n313\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.580\nif a lot of people are doing\nsomething about that problem.\n\n314\n00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.400\nThen, maybe it's a viable\ncommercial business but\n\n315\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.120\nthere's a lot more steps along the way.\n\n316\n00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.206\n&gt;&gt; So we as entrepreneurs, right?\n\n317\n00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:08.930\nWe are heavily ingrained in our community,\n\n318\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.690\nwe have people coming to us quite\nconstantly, on a regular basis.\n\n319\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.570\nSaying, hey I've got this solution,\nbut I don't have a problem,\n\n320\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.750\nand we say, okay, go find your problem.\n\n321\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.690\nThey say, well, we found a problem\nwith the solution that we made,\n\n322\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.060\nbut it really only hits four people.\n\n323\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.660\n&gt;&gt; And we go, well,\n\n324\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.760\nare they willing to spend a quarter\nbillion dollars each on the solution?\n\n325\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.482\nNo, well then, why are you talking to us?\n\n326\n00:15:32.482 --> 00:15:35.413\nBecause frankly, and\nit's fine talking to us, we don't mind.\n\n327\n00:15:35.413 --> 00:15:40.003\nWe literally get, I don't know if anywhere\nfrom three to a dozen proposals a day\n\n328\n00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:44.090\nabout people that have a solution\nto a problem that they have had.\n\n329\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.600\nAnd we applaud them for\nfinding a solution.\n\n330\n00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.826\nAnd then out of that, maybe one a day or\n\n331\n00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:52.871\none a week has a solution on a problem\nthat a dozen people or more have.\n\n332\n00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:56.043\nAnd out of that, maybe one a week or\none a month says, I've got\n\n333\n00:15:56.043 --> 00:15:59.954\na solution to a problem that thousands\nof people or millions of people have.\n\n334\n00:15:59.954 --> 00:16:01.845\nAnd they're willing to spend money on it,\n\n335\n00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:04.636\ncuz they're already spending\nmoney on an inferior solution.\n\n336\n00:16:04.636 --> 00:16:06.494\n[SOUND] Then we can get to work.\n\n337\n00:16:06.494 --> 00:16:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Now mind you,\n\n338\n00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.250\npart of the special sauce of Red Lion when\nwe're dealing with this kind of stuff is.\n\n339\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.610\nWe look at those solutions and problems\nalmost the exact same way as VCs do.\n\n340\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's cuz we're jaded.\n\n341\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well we are, we've been through\nbusiness, we've seen business fail,\n\n342\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.560\nwe've seen business succeed.\n\n343\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.630\nBut really,\nwe've sat down with a lot of VCs and\n\n344\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.360\nwe said, okay, what drives you,\nwhat makes you tick, and why do you care?\n\n345\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.180\nAnd so when we're dealing with\nthese types of solutions,\n\n346\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.160\nwe're looking at it the same way VCs are,\nright?\n\n347\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.710\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking at it from the sense\nthat the team attracts the money.\n\n348\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.410\nOkay, the proven track record\nof the team attracts the money.\n\n349\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.850\nThe track record of the people,\nthe solution,\n\n350\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.050\nthe marketing, the implementation,\nthey attract customers, okay?\n\n351\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.550\nSo you've got money coming in\nbecause your team is amazing,\n\n352\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.650\nyou've got customers coming in.\n\n353\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.040\nBecause you've got a superior solution\nwith marketing and implementation, so\n\n354\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.380\nnow I've got money, I've got customers.\n\n355\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.760\nAnd that means that I\nhave venture capital,\n\n356\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.550\nthat I can actually do thing with.\n\n357\n00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.200\nAll right, I can set up a website.\n\n358\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.500\nI can build my sales pitches.\n\n359\n00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.940\nI can get published and certified.\n\n360\n00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.530\nI can buy sales engineers.\n\n361\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.500\nI can do all sorts of things\nthat's going to increase sales.\n\n362\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.170\nNotice did anything in there say,\nI can iterate my technology?\n\n363\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.440\nWell no, because to a VC, that's not\nas important as getting more sales.\n\n364\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.520\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so when you do get VC funding,\nthe important thing\n\n365\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.840\nis that you put it towards what is\ngoing to move your business forward.\n\n366\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.700\nSo is it marketing, is it sales?\n\n367\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.760\nIs it everything that\nwe've just listed out?\n\n368\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.490\nYou really need to take an introspective\nlook at what you're doing,\n\n369\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.470\nhow you're doing it.\n\n370\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.140\nAnd where and when you're doing it,\n\n371\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.630\nto really understand where to\nappropriately apply your cash flow.\n\n372\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.890\nAnd remember, if you're applying your cash\nflow towards your sales and marketing,\n\n373\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.080\nthis will make the VCs happy.\n\n374\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.070\nAnd if you're applying your cash flow\nto iterating your technology and\n\n375\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.449\nmaking it better,\nthat will make your customers happy.\n\n376\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.500\nThe balance between the two\nis often a very perilous one.\n\n377\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.090\nAnd it's something you've gotta walk\nthat tightrope very very carefully.\n\n378\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:10.390\nSo to do that, we've actually come up with\na few sayings that we've heard over and\n\n379\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:15.250\nover again from VCs, accelerators,\nentrepreneurs, you name it.\n\n380\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.220\nWe love these things,\nso Scott start us off.\n\n381\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:25.130\n&gt;&gt; So like we've been saying, the team\neverything stands around the team.\n\n382\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.220\nGood team trumps the idea, a good team\n\n383\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.270\nleads up to the great idea\nevery day of the week.\n\n384\n00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.690\nSo what we're really trying to say here\nhold on what we're really trying to say is\n\n385\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.270\nyou need somebody to be able\nto bounce ideas off of.\n\n386\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.770\nIt's not just hey this is a great idea\nits hey this is a great idea lets\n\n387\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.120\nmake sure that it floats\nthat it moves us forward.\n\n388\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.360\nWell basically a well implemented idea,\nthat's not so\n\n389\n00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.930\ngreat, will beat an amazing\nidea that's not implemented.\n\n390\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.910\nIt's just that simple, the implementation,\n\n391\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.710\nthe team is more important than the idea,\nI can't say that enough.\n\n392\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.670\nNow obviously, if you can get\na fantastic team, a fantastic idea,\n\n393\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.680\na fantastic implementation that's\ncheap to do, simple to do, fast to do.\n\n394\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.950\nWell, you've got kind of a gold star,\n\n395\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.770\nyou've got the golden ticket to\nthe Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory.\n\n396\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.930\nBut other than that,\nit's implementation and the team.\n\n397\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the more that you go\nthrough the entrepreneurial life cycle.\n\n398\n00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.650\nThe more you'll understand in\na project management sense,\n\n399\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.990\nof how everything sets up for\nsales, right?\n\n400\n00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:42.880\nSo your first 5 sales take just\nas long as your next 95 sales.\n\n401\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.520\n&gt;&gt; That's counter-intuitive,\n\n402\n00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.120\nevery sale should take the same\namount of time, right?\n\n403\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.730\nIf every sale takes three months,\n\n404\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.320\nevery sale should take three months,\nbut it's not true.\n\n405\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.370\nBecause remember the first\ntime you do a sale,\n\n406\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.560\nyou have to not only set up your sales\npitch, you have to set up your sales deck.\n\n407\n00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.560\nYou have to set up all your marketing\nmaterials, you have to go ahead and\n\n408\n00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.290\ndo the marketing.\n\n409\n00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.800\nYou have to iterate your\nproduct the same time.\n\n410\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.140\nYou either have to be your own sales man\nand normally see all the sales people.\n\n411\n00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.240\nOkay, they're the first sales people,\nlet's be honest.\n\n412\n00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.680\nYou have to actually go out and\ntry and sell it and\n\n413\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.320\nrealize where you're\nfailing in selling it.\n\n414\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.770\nAnd then iterate your sales,\n\n415\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.410\nas well as iterate your technology\nto meet what they need.\n\n416\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.653\nSo the first few sales take forever.\n\n417\n00:20:18.653 --> 00:20:22.443\nOnce you get through the first four,\nfive, six, somewhere in there sales,\n\n418\n00:20:22.443 --> 00:20:24.140\nthey just stat rolling in.\n\n419\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.410\nBut if it takes you a year\nto get the first five sales,\n\n420\n00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.600\nthe next year it'll take you\nthe same year to do 95 sales.\n\n421\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.820\nBut that first year is not gonna be fun,\nlet me tell you.\n\n422\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.410\n&gt;&gt; And sprinkled on top of that,\nyou have to know who your customer is.\n\n423\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.090\nIf you're going for a commercial\nsale versus a government sale,\n\n424\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.110\nthere are different sales\ncycles that need to be hit for\n\n425\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.770\nyou to be able to move\nyour product forward.\n\n426\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.200\nSo the real question is,\n\n427\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.570\ndo you have the burn rate to be\nable to sustain the sales cycle?\n\n428\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.030\nAnd we'll get into sales metrics and how\nall of that works in a later discussion.\n\n429\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.110\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about\nsome of the other truisms,\n\n430\n00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.690\nsome of the other sayings we've come\nup with and heard over the years.\n\n431\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.060\nThe most important part of\nan entrepreneurial venture, like we said,\n\n432\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.410\na previously successfully\nexited entrepreneur.\n\n433\n00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.050\nWhat do I mean by the nicest thing you\ncan hear from a venture capitalist\n\n434\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.050\nis a hard no?\n\n435\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.060\nWell, most of the time a VC will say let's\ntalk in a month, that sounds interesting.\n\n436\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.900\nGet back to me next quarter,\nI think that's fascinating.\n\n437\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.870\nWhat they're saying is no, but\nif you really pick up your game and\n\n438\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.080\nreally kick butt maybe\nI'll talk to you then.\n\n439\n00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.840\nBut a VC that actually says,\nno I'm not interested.\n\n440\n00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.200\nI really respect what you're doing and\nwish you well but\n\n441\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.240\nit's not in my ball field?\n\n442\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.940\nThat's wonderful because I'm not\ngonna bother with you anymore and\n\n443\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.830\nI'm not gonna waste my time.\n\n444\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.420\nAnd remember, time is the absolute most\nimportant asset you have over your team,\n\n445\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.010\nover your technology, over everything.\n\n446\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.220\nYou can't get any time back.\n\n447\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.460\nRemember as well, 99% of startups will\nfail and that's being optimistic,\n\n448\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.500\nokay, that's not a joke.\n\n449\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.480\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthat in the next slide.\n\n450\n00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.560\nSo again if winning the lottery\nis your plan, don't, just don't,\n\n451\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.580\nkeep your day job, please dear God,\nkeep your day job, okay?\n\n452\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.615\n&gt;&gt; So, real quick though,\nwhat happened to FedEx, why is FedEx,\n\n453\n00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:02.323\nbecause FedEx I think really is the great.\n\n454\n00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:03.570\n&gt;&gt; You had to bring FedEx up.\n\n455\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:08.320\n&gt;&gt; I had to bring FedEx up,\nit's the perfect example for this.\n\n456\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n457\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.750\n&gt;&gt; I had to bring it up.\n\n458\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.340\n&gt;&gt; The FedEx story is simple.\n\n459\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.370\nIf you've never heard this, this is great.\n\n460\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.260\nIn the early days of Federal Express as\nit used to be known before it was FedEx.\n\n461\n00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.100\nThey didn't have enough money to fuel\ntheir planes for the next days flights,\n\n462\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.300\nseriously to deliver packages,\nthey just didn't have enough money.\n\n463\n00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.000\nThey had enough money to go that night and\nthat was it.\n\n464\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.660\nStand like $15,000 I think?\n\n465\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.180\nThey needed about 30, something like that.\n\n466\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.460\nThe founder of FedEx pulled the 15k out of\nthe bank, took the cash to Vegas, hopped\n\n467\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.906\non one of his own flights, took it to\nVegas, and put it on the blackjack tables.\n\n468\n00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:43.050\nHe won $57,000, which was enough to\nfuel the planes for the next day.\n\n469\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.540\nThey got a huge pay check from one\nof their customers the next day,\n\n470\n00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.100\nand they are fine from there on.\n\n471\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.940\nAnother multi billion dollar industry,\nplease don't follow his example,\n\n472\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.185\nyou are not guaranteed when it\nblack cheque, I promise you.\n\n473\n00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:58.330\n[LAUGH] They don't build billion\ndollars casinos in Vegas cuz\n\n474\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.480\npeople win all the time, okay?\n\n475\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.910\nThey build them because people\nwill lose to the house,\n\n476\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.190\nthe house does have the advantage,\nbut remember.\n\n477\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.860\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I had to take us on\nthat tangent for a quick second.\n\n478\n00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.480\n&gt;&gt; Fine.\n\n479\n00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.420\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it works for\nthis situation, you know.\n\n480\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Don't count on it,\nplease don't count on it.\n\n481\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.420\nDear God, don't count on it.\n\n482\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.490\n&gt;&gt; But when we're looking at how\nbusinesses survive on a year by\n\n483\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.100\nyear basis, there's a great\ngraphic that we found that really.\n\n484\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.700\nExemplifies what we're talking about,\nright?\n\n485\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.380\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about failure.\n\n486\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.380\nFailure is endemic in startup world, okay?\n\n487\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.724\nEntrepreneurial world,\n\n488\n00:23:35.724 --> 00:23:39.274\nstartup world or whatever you want\nto talk about it, it's endemic.\n\n489\n00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:42.746\nAs you can see, businesses that\nstarted in 1994, 5, 6 whatever,\n\n490\n00:23:42.746 --> 00:23:44.700\nthey're all in this graph.\n\n491\n00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.811\nBut this graph actually shows,\n\n492\n00:23:46.811 --> 00:23:50.491\nthat those companies fail at\na fairly consistent rate.\n\n493\n00:23:50.491 --> 00:23:55.629\nThey fail all the way down to about 20%,\nwhich means that 80%\n\n494\n00:23:55.629 --> 00:24:00.232\nof the companies fail within\n15 to 20 years, they die.\n\n495\n00:24:00.232 --> 00:24:04.390\nNow you can go, well that's not correct\nanymore, this graph only goes to 2005,\n\n496\n00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.393\nwe move faster now.\n\n497\n00:24:05.393 --> 00:24:07.877\nYeah, but not really.\n\n498\n00:24:07.877 --> 00:24:11.690\nThe sharpest part of that curve is right\nat the beginning from 0 to 4 years.\n\n499\n00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.920\nThey just go crazy, losing half of\nthe businesses in this sort of field die.\n\n500\n00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.530\nAnd information security companies and\n\n501\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.810\ninformation technology companies,\nthey have a much worse graph.\n\n502\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:26.320\nThey only have 37% success rate after\nfour years, that's pretty bad, okay?\n\n503\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.230\nSo let's talk about that for a second.\n\n504\n00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.630\nIn a ten year period between 2000 and\n2010,\n\n505\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:37.070\nso now we've moved the graph five\nyears into the future, okay?\n\n506\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.440\nThe rate of failure is pretty unpleasant,\nall right?\n\n507\n00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.620\nBy four years, 47% of businesses\nare just gone, have a nice day, goodbye.\n\n508\n00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:51.680\nScott, I mean, how many businesses\nthat you know of have gone out of\n\n509\n00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.039\nbusiness in the first three,\nfour, five years?\n\n510\n00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:58.420\n&gt;&gt; A lot, a lot, and that could\nbe due to a multitude of factors.\n\n511\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.640\nFrom how to fail as a CEO,\nhow to fail as a C-level exec in general.\n\n512\n00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.640\nHow to watch your product crash and\nburn, your burn rate is off.\n\n513\n00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.540\nTo, am I hiring the right people\nto back my product, right?\n\n514\n00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.110\nSo in trying to understand what\nreally makes a business fail,\n\n515\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.700\nit really takes a good look at\nthe team to understand what happened.\n\n516\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.200\nWhere the communication went awry, and\nhow that just tail-spinned out of control.\n\n517\n00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.620\n&gt;&gt; So we've actually got some of\nthe stats on that on the next slide.\n\n518\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.987\nAnd those small business statistics\nshow that in the first four years,\n\n519\n00:25:31.987 --> 00:25:35.360\nmore than 50% of businesses fail.\n\n520\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.230\nAnd the reasons are just\nwhat Scott talked about,\n\n521\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:42.180\nincompetence, unbalanced experience,\nall different kinds of problems.\n\n522\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:47.064\nBut effectively, any significant problem\nin your first few years can just destroy\n\n523\n00:25:47.064 --> 00:25:49.169\nyour small business, just crazy.\n\n524\n00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:53.055\nAny small financial misconduct,\nany small financial mistake,\n\n525\n00:25:53.055 --> 00:25:57.160\nnot even misconduct, can make your\nbusiness just go out of control.\n\n526\n00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.680\nAny small business from one\nthat's started by Elon Musk,\n\n527\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.040\nall the way down to one started\nby John Smith on the corner.\n\n528\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.270\nIf they screw up a invoice coming in,\n\n529\n00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.600\nand their taxes gets screwed up because\nof it, that can destroy a business.\n\n530\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.410\nAn extra $5,000 of debt, an extra\n$10,000 of cash, that they go, great,\n\n531\n00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.210\nwe're growing.\n\n532\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.180\nAnd they spend it, but\nthey don't get it that next quarter.\n\n533\n00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.360\nBut we were counting and\nmaking more sales, well,\n\n534\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.560\nsales might not be consistent\nquarter-to-quarter.\n\n535\n00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.485\nYou might have to go year-to-year to look\nat nice smooth consistent curve, but\n\n536\n00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:28.898\nquarter-to-quarter, you\nmight be in trouble.\n\n537\n00:26:28.898 --> 00:26:31.370\nAll right, there's so many problems, and\n\n538\n00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.960\nremember it's not just problems\nthat'll kill your business.\n\n539\n00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.000\nHow many businesses are started\nby the founder's funds?\n\n540\n00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.540\nYour credit cards, your savings account,\nremortgaging your house.\n\n541\n00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.940\n&gt;&gt; That's a big one right there.\n\n542\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.200\nA lot of people will actually go out and\nremortgage their house\n\n543\n00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.080\nbecause they believe in the idea,\nthey believe in the product.\n\n544\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.220\nAnd that's good that they believe,\nit might be a gang buster, but\n\n545\n00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.770\nat the end of the day, you really need\nto understand when to cut your losses.\n\n546\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.860\n&gt;&gt; So let's go to a personal story.\n\n547\n00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.140\nScott and I founded Red Lion,\n\n548\n00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.610\nand we founded a couple of\nother companies as well.\n\n549\n00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.610\nWe also realized along the way doing\nour studies of this stuff that\n\n550\n00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.640\ntwo founders actually is a huge advantage.\n\n551\n00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.340\nAnd there's reasons for that,\nwe realized that with ourselves.\n\n552\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.680\nSo with Scott and myself,\nScott is enthusiastic and\n\n553\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.780\nhe wants to get in there and do stuff.\n\n554\n00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.230\nHe wants, my God,\nthat's a great idea, let's do this!\n\n555\n00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.980\nWhether it's a marketing idea,\nwhether it's a sales idea,\n\n556\n00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.100\nwhether it's a whatever.\n\n557\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.510\nAnd I'm the one that goes,\nhey Scott, do we have a plan?\n\n558\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.350\nDo we have a way to make this work?\n\n559\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.920\nAnd that works for us, because I'm\nthe one that says, let's talk about this,\n\n560\n00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.360\nlet's work it through.\n\n561\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.550\nScott's the one that's exciting and\naggressive and\n\n562\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.590\npushy on getting things done.\n\n563\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.070\nSo between us we're a very,\nvery good mix, and\n\n564\n00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.560\na lot of times you'll\nsee that in founders.\n\n565\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.793\nI know that the founders of ITPro.TV are\nvastly different in their personalities,\n\n566\n00:27:44.793 --> 00:27:48.264\nand in the way that they approach\nproblems, and that works for them.\n\n567\n00:27:48.264 --> 00:27:51.645\nIn every company out there\nyou'll see a mix of people.\n\n568\n00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:54.335\nAnd any company that has a cult\nof personality I'll call it,\n\n569\n00:27:54.335 --> 00:27:57.825\nwith one founder that they do their own\nthing and that's the way it gets done.\n\n570\n00:27:57.825 --> 00:27:59.532\nEither they're wildly successful or\n\n571\n00:27:59.532 --> 00:28:02.480\nthey're gonna be a miserable\nfailure really quickly.\n\n572\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.192\n&gt;&gt; All right, so speaking of success,\nlet's get into this for a quick second.\n\n573\n00:28:06.192 --> 00:28:12.090\nRight, what Josh, would you consider\na good key marker of success is for\n\n574\n00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.830\nany business across the board?\n\n575\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.610\n&gt;&gt; It depends, you've got sales,\nyou've got margin, you've got profit,\n\n576\n00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.050\nyou've got gross sales,\nyou've got annual revenue.\n\n577\n00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.810\nYou've got all kinds of numbers that mean\ndifferent things to accountants versus,\n\n578\n00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.560\nwell normal people.\n\n579\n00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.310\nAnd these numbers can be vastly,\nvastly misleading if you don't\n\n580\n00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.610\nknow what you're talking about,\nand I mean vastly misleading.\n\n581\n00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.733\nIf I told you that we're selling a product\nfor $1 million and we've got 20 sales,\n\n582\n00:28:38.733 --> 00:28:42.454\nwell you're like wow you've got 20\nmillion in revenue in your first year,\n\n583\n00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.099\nand I go yes.\n\n584\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:49.050\nAnd then I go, but\nit cause us 5 million to produce each one!\n\n585\n00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.672\nWell we've got 20 million in revenue and\na hundred, what would that be,\n\n586\n00:28:52.672 --> 00:28:57.000\n80 million in losses because our profit\nis negative 19 million on everyone.\n\n587\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.520\nThat would be a problem now, wouldn't it?\n\n588\n00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.437\nSo if I just told you the first figure,\nyou'd think we were a wild success.\n\n589\n00:29:02.437 --> 00:29:07.049\n&gt;&gt; Right, now it's really\nimportant to understand what\n\n590\n00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:09.888\nthis slide is telling us, okay?\n\n591\n00:29:09.888 --> 00:29:12.071\nSo let's take a look at it real quick,\n\n592\n00:29:12.071 --> 00:29:17.002\nbecause these are definitions that every\nentrepreneur needs to understand, okay?\n\n593\n00:29:17.002 --> 00:29:21.880\nYour net profit margin, your EBITDA,\nyour gross margin, right?\n\n594\n00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.024\nOr your gross profits or your net profit,\nyour margining, your rack rate,\n\n595\n00:29:26.024 --> 00:29:27.791\nyour wrap rate, and your MSRP.\n\n596\n00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:29.413\n&gt;&gt; These are actually simple concepts,\n\n597\n00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:33.070\nif think about it, they're very long\ndefinitions, but they're simple concepts.\n\n598\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:37.350\nStart at the bottom, your MSRP is your\nmanufacture's suggested retail price.\n\n599\n00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.280\nI mean, it's basically, your suggested\nretail price is how much you're gonna\n\n600\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.860\nsell it for,\nthe price you've got on the tag.\n\n601\n00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.560\nBut there's also things like street price.\n\n602\n00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.498\nIf you've ever gone to a store and\nbought a camera,\n\n603\n00:29:49.498 --> 00:29:51.582\nthe retail price on\nthe camera might be $1,000.\n\n604\n00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:56.439\nBut when you go to the store,\nit's only 800 bucks, well why is that?\n\n605\n00:29:56.439 --> 00:30:00.349\nWell they're buying it at $600 or $500,\nand though they could sell it at $1,000,\n\n606\n00:30:00.349 --> 00:30:01.111\nwhich is the MSRP,\n\n607\n00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:04.050\nthey're putting a discount on it to\nmake you think that they like you.\n\n608\n00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.110\nThey like your face, you're an awesome\nguy and we're gonna sell it to you for\n\n609\n00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.420\na discount.\n\n610\n00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.730\nDo you hear a used car salesman there,\nI don't know why.\n\n611\n00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:15.010\nAnyway, but the rates and margins and\n\n612\n00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.360\nthe profits are important, and so you have\nto understand what those numbers mean.\n\n613\n00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.530\nBecause if not, you're gonna go on\nShark Tank and you're gonna get hurt\n\n614\n00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.680\nby what they talk to you, if you don't\nunderstand what all those terms mean.\n\n615\n00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.710\nAs in any profession,\nas in any technological profession,\n\n616\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.900\nas in any office profession,\nthere are terms of art.\n\n617\n00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.800\nThere are words that if you do\nnot know the names of them,\n\n618\n00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.400\nthey're going to hurt you.\n\n619\n00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.030\nFor example,\n\n620\n00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:42.180\nright now on the screen, there are what\nI would call a picture in picture.\n\n621\n00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.830\nBut what our switcher Megan taught\nme was this is called a double box\n\n622\n00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:50.140\nin the industry, in the TV and\nadvertising and broadcasting industry.\n\n623\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:54.660\nThat's fine, I had to learn their\nterminology, their vernacular, their\n\n624\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.550\njargon, so that I can talk intelligible\nwith Megan and she can understand me.\n\n625\n00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.354\nCuz most the time she looks at me and\ngoes, really, what?\n\n626\n00:31:00.354 --> 00:31:03.380\nAnd I go, I'm sorry,\nlet me explain it a different way.\n\n627\n00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.062\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Okay.\n\n628\n00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:05.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n629\n00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:08.100\ngetting back on track here a little bit,\nokay?\n\n630\n00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.940\nLet's talk about NPM, right,\nthe net profit margin, okay?\n\n631\n00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:20.370\nThe net profit margin is the ratio\nof net profits to revenue, right?\n\n632\n00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.524\nSo when you're trying to understand\nhow NPM really works and say,\n\n633\n00:31:23.524 --> 00:31:25.170\nwell why does this really matter?\n\n634\n00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.920\nLet's take a look at\na couple of industries that\n\n635\n00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.240\nreally value where the NPM is.\n\n636\n00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.236\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, yeah, so\n\n637\n00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:38.630\nwe have oil and gas at a -7.6% NPM.\n\n638\n00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.015\nLeast profitable industry\nin the US by NPM.\n\n639\n00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:42.527\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n640\n00:31:42.527 --> 00:31:46.780\n&gt;&gt; If you think about everything that goes\nin to it, oil and gas, you have the drill,\n\n641\n00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.741\nyou have fracking now, you have all\nthe technology, the people behind it.\n\n642\n00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:52.401\nEverything that goes into it.\n\n643\n00:31:52.401 --> 00:31:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good point, is that why\nthe price of oil and gas matter so\n\n644\n00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.894\nmuch as to which industries are spun up or\ndown as the the price of oil per barrel,\n\n645\n00:31:59.894 --> 00:32:01.531\nI think it is, goes up or down?\n\n646\n00:32:01.531 --> 00:32:02.484\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n647\n00:32:02.484 --> 00:32:07.223\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so shale oil mining Is only\nprofitable when the price of oil is\n\n648\n00:32:07.223 --> 00:32:09.147\nhigh enough to justify it.\n\n649\n00:32:09.147 --> 00:32:11.480\nWhen it's not, they just shut\nthose things down and wait for\n\n650\n00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.150\nthe price of oil to go back up again.\n\n651\n00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.650\nIt's not worth it for\nthem to keep mining for the shale oil to\n\n652\n00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:19.400\npull the oil out of that shale rock, if\nit's not gonna be profitable to sell it.\n\n653\n00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.505\nSo why should they lose money?\n\n654\n00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:23.789\n&gt;&gt; But what's really interesting, and\nif we could pull this out full screen, so\n\n655\n00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:25.630\nyou can see the entire slide.\n\n656\n00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:32.445\nIs beer wine and liquor are at a positive\n3.4% for NPM, for net profit margin.\n\n657\n00:32:32.445 --> 00:32:33.763\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying go buy more alcohol?\n\n658\n00:32:33.763 --> 00:32:34.647\n&gt;&gt; Go buy more alcohol.\n\n659\n00:32:34.647 --> 00:32:36.320\n&gt;&gt; I love this guy.\n\n660\n00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.407\nOkay, so net profit margin,\nit looks bad, but that means you put all\n\n661\n00:32:41.407 --> 00:32:47.049\nthe sunk costs in there, you've put\nall the costs for all your technology.\n\n662\n00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:49.325\nYou've put all the costs for\neverything in there but these,\n\n663\n00:32:49.325 --> 00:32:52.191\nremember these are the least profitable\nindustries that we've looked at.\n\n664\n00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:54.667\nOkay, this is sort of\nthe bottom of the barrel, and\n\n665\n00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:56.633\nit's shocking how low the margins are.\n\n666\n00:32:56.633 --> 00:32:59.599\nBecause really,\nthe net profit margin is a margin, okay?\n\n667\n00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:04.384\nIt's in the name, and the margins on\nsome of these industries are very,\n\n668\n00:33:04.384 --> 00:33:06.040\nvery, very, very low.\n\n669\n00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.160\nIt's like why would\npeople bother to do that?\n\n670\n00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.101\nWell some of it is because there's so\nmuch volume that's worth it to them.\n\n671\n00:33:11.101 --> 00:33:14.385\nWhen you talk about oil and\ngas extraction, when they make money, they\n\n672\n00:33:14.385 --> 00:33:17.953\nmake a penny on every barrel but they're\nselling a million barrels a minute.\n\n673\n00:33:17.953 --> 00:33:20.217\nOkay, that's a lot of pennies,\nit's worth it to them.\n\n674\n00:33:20.217 --> 00:33:24.280\n&gt;&gt; So their total addressable market you\nwould say is in the net volume of sales?\n\n675\n00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.420\n&gt;&gt; Well when you start\ntalking about market,\n\n676\n00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.000\nyou start talking about how\nmany people are gonna buy?\n\n677\n00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.600\nWho's actually gonna buy from you?\n\n678\n00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.242\nWhat are the people that you're gonna\nget to loyal customers for you?\n\n679\n00:33:34.242 --> 00:33:38.865\nSo that goes from your total addressable\nmarket to your served available market to\n\n680\n00:33:38.865 --> 00:33:40.347\nwho you actually sell to.\n\n681\n00:33:40.347 --> 00:33:44.842\nSo if there is let's say a billion cars\nI'm making these numbers up don't take\n\n682\n00:33:44.842 --> 00:33:45.872\nthese as gospel.\n\n683\n00:33:45.872 --> 00:33:50.112\nIf there's a billion cars in the US,\nthat's your total addressable market for\n\n684\n00:33:50.112 --> 00:33:53.164\nselling oil or in this case gasoline or\ndiesel to, okay?\n\n685\n00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:56.913\nBut if you've got to serve the available\nmarket because there's let's say a quarter\n\n686\n00:33:56.913 --> 00:33:59.931\nbillion cars using bio diesel from\nall the fry grease in McDonalds and\n\n687\n00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:02.449\nBurger King and\nall the fast food restaurants out there.\n\n688\n00:34:02.449 --> 00:34:05.720\nYour served available market is now\nreduced to three quarters of the billion\n\n689\n00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.239\nvehicles.\n\n690\n00:34:06.239 --> 00:34:11.216\nAnd you've got a chain of gas stations\nacross the country that sell to about\n\n691\n00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:13.036\n400 million vehicles.\n\n692\n00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:13.553\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n693\n00:34:13.553 --> 00:34:16.973\nthat's the total address of a market,\nthe served available market and\n\n694\n00:34:16.973 --> 00:34:18.228\nwho you actually sell to.\n\n695\n00:34:18.228 --> 00:34:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's for\ndemographics really come in to play.\n\n696\n00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.487\nSo understanding who wants your product\nat what time and in what area, right?\n\n697\n00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:31.239\nSo talking about all that we say okay,\nwell how do we validate the marke, right?\n\n698\n00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.418\nThere's a couple of approaches,\nyou have the top down approach or\n\n699\n00:34:34.418 --> 00:34:36.196\nthe bottoms-up approach, right?\n\n700\n00:34:36.196 --> 00:34:40.115\nThe bottoms-up approach takes company\nspecifics with market specifics.\n\n701\n00:34:40.115 --> 00:34:44.688\nTakes the fundamental understanding of\nmarketing and the adjustability, right?\n\n702\n00:34:44.688 --> 00:34:46.235\nAnd goes from the bottom up,\n\n703\n00:34:46.235 --> 00:34:50.429\nversus the top down which is the\nunderstanding of the macro economy, right?\n\n704\n00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.797\nThe smaller economy within it,\nthe competitiveness of and\n\n705\n00:34:54.797 --> 00:34:59.352\nsorry, penetration of veer marking and\nthe digestibility.\n\n706\n00:34:59.352 --> 00:35:03.198\nNow notice,\nboth of them had addressability, right?\n\n707\n00:35:03.198 --> 00:35:04.437\nIn the center, okay?\n\n708\n00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:07.210\nSo you take those two approaches and\n\n709\n00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:12.204\nyou put them together as you're\ndoing your market validation,\n\n710\n00:35:12.204 --> 00:35:16.565\nand that tells you exactly\nwhere your target market is.\n\n711\n00:35:16.565 --> 00:35:18.603\n&gt;&gt; These are a lot of very large words.\n\n712\n00:35:18.603 --> 00:35:19.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That means some very,\n\n713\n00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:20.735\nvery simple things.\n\n714\n00:35:20.735 --> 00:35:24.615\nIf you understand who's buying things\nsimilar to what you wanna sell,\n\n715\n00:35:24.615 --> 00:35:28.247\nif you are understanding who owns\nthe market share as in segments.\n\n716\n00:35:28.247 --> 00:35:32.092\nIf you understand how many people could\nyou address with your technology,\n\n717\n00:35:32.092 --> 00:35:34.541\nwith your approach,\nwith your system, okay?\n\n718\n00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:35.816\nThese are what you're talking about.\n\n719\n00:35:35.816 --> 00:35:38.990\nIt's not this complex,\nit can be made that complex and\n\n720\n00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.350\neconomists delight in doing so.\n\n721\n00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.320\nBut really, the more you understand\nabout the people who might be interested\n\n722\n00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.220\nin buying your stuff,\nthe better off you are.\n\n723\n00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.554\nKind of that simple to be honest with you.\n\n724\n00:35:48.554 --> 00:35:50.435\n&gt;&gt; Right, but to get into that,\n\n725\n00:35:50.435 --> 00:35:54.517\nwe really need to understand\nthe implementation scale of pain.\n\n726\n00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.946\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n727\n00:35:55.946 --> 00:35:58.084\n&gt;&gt; There are two\nimplementation scales of pain.\n\n728\n00:35:58.084 --> 00:36:01.040\nThere's the business scale and\nthere's the technical scale.\n\n729\n00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.631\nOn the business scale,\nyou've gotta find decent engineers.\n\n730\n00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:08.240\nYou've gotta get hardware, you gotta\nfind servers and hosting and payroll.\n\n731\n00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.710\nMy God, you gotta make payroll.\n\n732\n00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.686\nYou've gotta make money to pay people\nwith, what is this country coming to?\n\n733\n00:36:13.686 --> 00:36:19.113\n&gt;&gt; And by the way the server and\nthe hosting are universal at this point.\n\n734\n00:36:19.113 --> 00:36:20.215\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n&gt;&gt; There interchangeable, commoditized.\n\n735\n00:36:20.215 --> 00:36:23.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, doesn't matter what\nline of business you're in,\n\n736\n00:36:23.512 --> 00:36:27.030\nyou're going to need hard ware\nto back up what you do, right?\n\n737\n00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.283\n&gt;&gt; It could be a WS, it could be-\n&gt;&gt; Azure.\n\n738\n00:36:29.283 --> 00:36:30.242\n&gt;&gt; DigitalOcean, it could be Azure.\n\n739\n00:36:30.242 --> 00:36:30.940\n&gt;&gt; It could be DO.\n\n740\n00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.747\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nyou've gotta find some hardware.\n\n741\n00:36:32.747 --> 00:36:37.470\nYou gotta do things, you gotta make\nthings happen in your company.\n\n742\n00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.333\nYou gotta hire people, which means you\ngotta write job descriptions cuz what if\n\n743\n00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:42.393\nyou hire someone and\nthey turn out not to do the right job.\n\n744\n00:36:42.393 --> 00:36:44.876\nIf you never wrote a job description,\nthey're gonna say, hey,\n\n745\n00:36:44.876 --> 00:36:46.926\nI didn't know what my job was,\nso how can you fire me?\n\n746\n00:36:46.926 --> 00:36:48.820\nI'm gonna file a lawsuit.\n\n747\n00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.795\nDo you really?\n\n748\n00:36:49.795 --> 00:36:51.075\nNo, it happens, trust me.\n\n749\n00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:54.886\nSo right job descriptions,\nyou gotta forecast all your sales revenue,\n\n750\n00:36:54.886 --> 00:36:57.272\nyou gotta market, you gotta get publicity.\n\n751\n00:36:57.272 --> 00:37:01.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but remember, there is\nthe touchy thing about publicity though.\n\n752\n00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:03.613\nI used to work in the TV industry, right?\n\n753\n00:37:03.613 --> 00:37:07.471\nAnd I remember my executive,\nwho is above me saying,\n\n754\n00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:12.554\nit doesn't matter whether it's good or\nbad publicity is publicity.\n\n755\n00:37:12.554 --> 00:37:15.280\nRealistically it's getting your\nname out there in front of people.\n\n756\n00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.585\nOf course, we don't wanna sit\nback with a malign event and say,\n\n757\n00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:21.113\nit was bad publicity.\n\n758\n00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:24.875\nBut publicity is publicity.\n\n759\n00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:28.038\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But then there's the big problems and\n\n760\n00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:31.989\nthe big problems for\nbusiness is finding customers,\n\n761\n00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:35.890\nfinding investors and\nactually closing sales.\n\n762\n00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.473\nGetting somebody to stroke a cheque,\nthat's a term of art.\n\n763\n00:37:38.473 --> 00:37:42.790\nWhich is to say sign a cheque off and give\nit to you, and actually clear the check,\n\n764\n00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.391\ncuz remember it isn't real.\n\n765\n00:37:44.391 --> 00:37:46.961\nNot when you get a check,\nnot when you get a customer.\n\n766\n00:37:46.961 --> 00:37:51.002\nIt's real when the check clears and\nthey don't ask for a return or a refund,\n\n767\n00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:53.163\nbecause dear God, that happens too.\n\n768\n00:37:53.163 --> 00:37:58.595\n&gt;&gt; So if you're coming into\na implementation of technology, you really\n\n769\n00:37:58.595 --> 00:38:04.590\nneed to ask yourself, can you write code\nfor little to no money to begin with?\n\n770\n00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.779\nBecause if you don't, and remember this is\nnow the technical implementation scale of\n\n771\n00:38:07.779 --> 00:38:09.760\npain, you've gotta get your code written.\n\n772\n00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.670\nYou've gotta get your MVP written,\nyour minimum viable product.\n\n773\n00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.924\nYou've actually gotta write something that\nsolves at least a part of the problem.\n\n774\n00:38:16.924 --> 00:38:20.299\nAnd you've gotta write something that\nsolves a part of the problem that is\n\n775\n00:38:20.299 --> 00:38:23.140\nattractive for a customer to use so\nthat they can use it.\n\n776\n00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.323\nAnd it's superior to what's\ncurrently out there,\n\n777\n00:38:25.323 --> 00:38:27.412\nprobably backed by millions\nof dollars of sales.\n\n778\n00:38:27.412 --> 00:38:30.993\nAnd they're wanting to use your thing\nwith your tiny little startup that has no\n\n779\n00:38:30.993 --> 00:38:31.707\ntrack record.\n\n780\n00:38:31.707 --> 00:38:34.467\nAnd probably no successfully\nexit entrepreneurs and\n\n781\n00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:36.618\nthey're willing to pay you money for it.\n\n782\n00:38:36.618 --> 00:38:37.510\nYeah, that's not fun.\n\n783\n00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.650\nSo let's talk about what investors\nare gonna ask you when you go, hey,\n\n784\n00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.480\nI need some money to get things\nrolling with this whole process.\n\n785\n00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.101\nCan you give me some money?\n\n786\n00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:48.580\nI mean you're an investor,\ndon't you wanna invest in my amazing idea?\n\n787\n00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.085\nLet's talk about what the investors\nare thinking when you come to them with\n\n788\n00:38:51.085 --> 00:38:51.611\nthat problem.\n\n789\n00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:56.936\n&gt;&gt; So right up front, investors can ask\nyou, what does your company do, okay?\n\n790\n00:38:56.936 --> 00:38:59.600\nWhat is unique about you, right?\n\n791\n00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.690\nWhat is the bigger problem\nthat you're trying to solve?\n\n792\n00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.300\nWhat is your market opportunity, right?\n\n793\n00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.332\nWhat is your actually addressable market?\n\n794\n00:39:07.332 --> 00:39:12.258\nAnd that right there is huge because\nit tells you how many products you can\n\n795\n00:39:12.258 --> 00:39:16.881\nsell or how many units of what\nyou've built, you can sell, right?\n\n796\n00:39:16.881 --> 00:39:19.034\n&gt;&gt; You can talk about the founders and\nkey team members.\n\n797\n00:39:19.034 --> 00:39:22.375\nNotice, we talked about the product\nslightly in terms of the actual\n\n798\n00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:23.665\naddressable market, but\n\n799\n00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:26.782\nwe haven't actually talked about\nwhat the technology is yet.\n\n800\n00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:28.595\nSo who are the founders and\nkey team members?\n\n801\n00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:32.128\nWhat domain experience, if you're\ntalking about an anti-virus product,\n\n802\n00:39:32.128 --> 00:39:33.520\njust to give an example.\n\n803\n00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.240\nWhat anti-virus experience do your people\nhave, or selling an anti-virus product,\n\n804\n00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.090\nyou're dealing with anti-virus, you're\ndealing with people that buy anti-virus or\n\n805\n00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.710\ndoing anything with anti-virus.\n\n806\n00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.490\nWhat experience they have with that?\n\n807\n00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.209\nWhy is you're team uniquely capable?\n\n808\n00:39:45.209 --> 00:39:46.900\nWhat motivates you as a founder?\n\n809\n00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.560\nHow are you gonna scale you team?\n\n810\n00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.020\nWho are you gonna hire?\n\n811\n00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.380\nHow are you gonna hire them?\n\n812\n00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:56.060\nWho are you gonna pick up that's gonna\nimpress the heck out of the next set of\n\n813\n00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:56.887\ninvestors?\n\n814\n00:39:56.887 --> 00:39:58.971\nWe haven't even talked\nabout the technology yet.\n\n815\n00:39:58.971 --> 00:40:02.583\n&gt;&gt; No, but what we do need to\ntalk about are the competitors.\n\n816\n00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:07.056\nWho are you going up against and\nwhat does the market look like for them?\n\n817\n00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:10.910\nHave they gone through the steps\nnecessary to solve the problems that you\n\n818\n00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.820\ncould possibly be seeing?\n\n819\n00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.260\nAnd what kind of traction did they get?\n\n820\n00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.150\nHow did they get it?\n\n821\n00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.830\nBecause that actually might\nhelp you rather than hurt you.\n\n822\n00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:24.975\nSo understanding who's out there is\nalways a very big key factor to success.\n\n823\n00:40:24.975 --> 00:40:28.320\n&gt;&gt; Again, out of these 20 questions, and\nwe're not gonna go through all of them.\n\n824\n00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.936\nBut they're fantastic questions to\nask yourself about your product,\n\n825\n00:40:31.936 --> 00:40:34.354\nabout your competitors,\nabout your company.\n\n826\n00:40:34.354 --> 00:40:37.021\nAbout your people,\nabout the team that you've developed,\n\n827\n00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:39.060\nthrough your years of networking.\n\n828\n00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.397\nOkay, through doing these things,\ngetting ready to build a company,\n\n829\n00:40:43.397 --> 00:40:45.505\ngetting ready to build a product.\n\n830\n00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:49.388\nThese are the questions you need to\nask yourself and notice, only one or\n\n831\n00:40:49.388 --> 00:40:53.570\ntwo of them is actually about the product,\nabout the technology.\n\n832\n00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.950\nThat's about it.\n\n833\n00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.780\nEverything else is about your team,\nyour traction, your sales,\n\n834\n00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.100\nyour marketing, your market,\nyour intellectual property, the risks,\n\n835\n00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.710\nthe competitors, legalities,\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n836\n00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.910\nOnly one or\ntwo questions is actually about the-\n\n837\n00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I have to interject here.\n\n838\n00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:17.860\nLet's boil this down to one question,\none question everybody can deal with.\n\n839\n00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.090\nIs it all worth it?\n\n840\n00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.650\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n841\n00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:23.150\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n842\n00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.080\n&gt;&gt; Not even close.\n\n843\n00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.080\nIt's a horrifyingly bad idea.\n\n844\n00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.060\nDon't do it.\n\n845\n00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.210\nNo, I'm serious.\n\n846\n00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.860\nDon't do it, okay?\n\n847\n00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.372\nYou're not going to do this\nunless you're an absolutely\n\n848\n00:41:34.372 --> 00:41:39.480\npassionate person about this team,\nthis market, the risks.\n\n849\n00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.952\nUnless the competitors are so\nbad that you know you can beat them,\n\n850\n00:41:42.952 --> 00:41:47.070\nunless you've done a competitive\ndifferentiator and measured all of that.\n\n851\n00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.266\nYou're not gonna do it unless\nyou absolutely know for\n\n852\n00:41:50.266 --> 00:41:53.827\na fact that you can beat\neverybody else on the marketplace.\n\n853\n00:41:53.827 --> 00:41:56.811\nOr at least take enough of their business\naway to make it worthwhile to the tune of\n\n854\n00:41:56.811 --> 00:41:59.070\nmillions and millions and\nmillions of dollars.\n\n855\n00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.290\nYou're not gonna do this unless you know\nthat you've got people backing you up who\n\n856\n00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.790\nare just rock solid,\n100% never gonna let you go.\n\n857\n00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.620\nNever gonna let you, wait wrong song.\n\n858\n00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.520\n&gt;&gt; Whoa whoa whoa time out, time out.\n\n859\n00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.320\nWe can't do that on this show, okay?\n\n860\n00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.190\n&gt;&gt; All right fine.\n\n861\n00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.940\nBut in all seriousness unless\nyou're absolutely obsessive and\n\n862\n00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.690\npassionate about it, don't do it, okay?\n\n863\n00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:21.770\nI'm not joking.\n\n864\n00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.520\nThis series is not to tell you\nhow you should be awesome and\n\n865\n00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:29.610\ndo a business everyday because frankly,\nthat's not a good idea.\n\n866\n00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.700\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's say that you have made the decision.\n\n867\n00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.710\nThat you are going to do it and\nyou say, you know what Josh and Scott?\n\n868\n00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.950\nI have heard all of your malarkey.\n\n869\n00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.960\nI've heard it all,\nI know what I'm doing, okay?\n\n870\n00:42:42.902 --> 00:42:46.750\nI've made the decision is to\nstart the business, all right?\n\n871\n00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.067\nNotice how sad he sounds.\n\n872\n00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:49.950\nDid you hear how sad he sounds?\n\n873\n00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.682\nHe's like okay,\nI'm gonna go start a business.\n\n874\n00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:52.725\nI suppose it's okay.\n\n875\n00:42:52.725 --> 00:42:53.866\n&gt;&gt; I hope you're ready for no sleep.\n\n876\n00:42:53.866 --> 00:42:57.642\nI really do, I really hope that you\nare tried, true and prepared for\n\n877\n00:42:57.642 --> 00:42:59.040\nabsolutely zero sleep.\n\n878\n00:43:00.972 --> 00:43:05.030\n&gt;&gt; But you know what,\nif you're gonna do it, do it right.\n\n879\n00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.580\nEither be a successfully exited\nentrepreneur or be somebody that's failed.\n\n880\n00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.770\nI'm not joking.\n\n881\n00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.400\nFailure actually gives you a better\nchance of succeeding the next time.\n\n882\n00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.700\nNot much of a better chance,\nbut a better chance.\n\n883\n00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.270\nAnd it gives you a heck of\na lot of learning experience.\n\n884\n00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.430\nIf you get that learning experience,\nif you get the knowledge, that wow,\n\n885\n00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:24.200\nI did this wrong the last time.\n\n886\n00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.920\nI'm going to try something different.\n\n887\n00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.750\nAt the very least you're lessening your\nchance of having the same problems\n\n888\n00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.750\nthat you did during your failure mode,\nokay?\n\n889\n00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.530\nYou need to do this at least once.\n\n890\n00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.990\nIf you're gonna do it, do it,\nand if you fail, don't give up.\n\n891\n00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.120\nEvery failure gives you a better\nchance to succeed the next time.\n\n892\n00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.200\nNow realistically, that just sounds like\nI'm pushing you to mortgage your house and\n\n893\n00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.120\ndo 15 businesses in a row, and\n\n894\n00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.760\nfail every time because I\nmight succeed the next time.\n\n895\n00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.570\nJosh said so.\n\n896\n00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:57.690\nI'm not, okay?\n\n897\n00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.020\nPlan each and every single one.\n\n898\n00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.470\nIf it takes you years in between,\ntake years, that's fine.\n\n899\n00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:03.640\nBut do it the right way.\n\n900\n00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.190\nIf you're gonna do it, if you're bound and\ndetermined, I'm gonna start a business and\n\n901\n00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.090\nI'm gonna succeed, do it.\n\n902\n00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.640\nAnd I respect that, and\nI respect not doing it as well.\n\n903\n00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.160\nSome people are risk averse and\ndon't want to.\n\n904\n00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.660\n&gt;&gt; So get out there and if you really\nwant to do if you really want to try and\n\n905\n00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.400\nforay into this, get out there and\nmake sales happen.\n\n906\n00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.530\nUnderstand what it takes for a sales\ncycle because guess what tech is only 5%.\n\n907\n00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:30.071\nOkay you have to bring in revenue\nyou have to bring in sales\n\n908\n00:44:30.071 --> 00:44:31.082\n&gt;&gt;

Hi, I'm Josh Marpet.\n\n16\n00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:49.060\nI'm the COO of Red Lion.\n\n17\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.990\nI've been a speaker at so\nmany conferences,\n\n18\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.960\nI literally don't remember anymore.\n\n19\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.320\nI'm a member of the CEO organizations,\nMindshare and Missionlink.\n\n20\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.080\nI've been around the block more than once.\n\n21\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.310\nI was a board member of Hackers for\n\n22\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.610\nCharity besides Las Vegas,\nCloud Security Alliance Delaware Valley.\n\n23\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.030\nWe're starting up a journal of\ninformation security called SYNACK.\n\n24\n00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.600\nI run besides Delaware and\noccasionally I get to nap once in a while.\n\n25\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Napping is important.\n\n26\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.770\nAnd you know what's also important?\n\n27\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.449\nProduct creation okay?\n\n28\n00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:19.900\nAnd that's really what we're\ntalking about in today's talk.\n\n29\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.000\nWe are moving into the steps of\nwhat it takes for making a product.\n\n30\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.510\n&gt;&gt; So what are those steps?\n\n31\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.230\nWell, it ranges from where are you\nnow to where do I go from here?\n\n32\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.420\nHow do I fund it?\nWhat are the different stages?\n\n33\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.390\nHow do I pay for it?\n\n34\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.420\nAll these different steps,\nnot necessarily in this order, but\n\n35\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.300\nthis is the way we just organize it to\nmake it simple to go through, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.190\nSo don't take this as Gospel\nin terms of the order.\n\n37\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.673\nBut let's start with where am I now.\n\n38\n00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:53.490\nIf you've got a product, I have\nan idea but I haven't built anything.\n\n39\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.960\nI've built a prototype or\nI actually have some customers.\n\n40\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.901\nSo those are sort of the three\ndefining moments in product creation.\n\n41\n00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.547\nAll right, and if you have an idea.\n\n42\n00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:07.146\nYou know this because, I've got\nsomething a solution for a problem,\n\n43\n00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:11.200\nI've got a problem that, that problem\na lot of people have that problem.\n\n44\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.790\nThey have money they're\ncurrently spending, and hey.\n\n45\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.860\nI've got a better solution.\n\n46\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nhave you really built a prototype?\n\n47\n00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.280\nOkay?\n\n48\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.830\nWas it simple to build?\n\n49\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.130\nDoes it actually work?\n\n50\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.780\nThat's a real big problem\nthat we're seeing.\n\n51\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.720\nPeople build prototypes, and they build\nit for just one aspect of the problem.\n\n52\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.770\nSo does your prototype actually fit it?\n\n53\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.990\nAnd what are your customers saying,\nare they paying for the solution?\n\n54\n00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.640\nAre you post revenue right?\n\n55\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.483\nSo, does it mean that you have put out\nenough prototypes to be able to say\n\n56\n00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:51.036\nyes I have customers.\n\n57\n00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:53.711\n&gt;&gt; Well it's not necessarily putting\nout the number of prototypes,\n\n58\n00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:55.250\nit's how many customers do you have?\n\n59\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.163\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; So again, that third stage is,\n\n60\n00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:01.441\nI had an idea, I built a prototype and\nnow I've got somebody to pay for me,\n\n61\n00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:06.510\npaid me for that prototype, which is\namazing because then you're post revenue.\n\n62\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.876\nPost revenue is a term of art\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n63\n00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Adventure capitalists use it a lot.\n\n64\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.104\nIt means somebody has started\ngiving me money to use my product,\n\n65\n00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:14.052\nwhich is a wonderful stage\nto be at by the way.\n\n66\n00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:16.232\n&gt;&gt; But what about validation?\n\n67\n00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:18.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so validation is important.\n\n68\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.470\nIf you don't have validation,\nyou've got a problem.\n\n69\n00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.310\nNow look this is an interesting one.\n\n70\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.770\nSo Juicero, if you've heard about them,\nthey spent $120 million\n\n71\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.640\nto build an incredibly complex supply\nchain and a beautifully engineered product\n\n72\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.600\nthat you could replicate with a pair\nof hands around one of their pouches.\n\n73\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.680\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; If you didn't hear about them it was\n\n74\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.850\na $400 juice machine that you had to\nuse their pouches to get juice out of.\n\n75\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.060\nEach pouch gave you, I think one\nglass of juice and cost about four or\n\n76\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.380\nfive dollars, which means that I could\nhave gone down to my local barista,\n\n77\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.940\nand smoothie shop and got one for\nroughly the same price.\n\n78\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.100\nBut the only reason that you get\na Juicero was, it looks cool.\n\n79\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.480\nNeedless to say Juicero is out of\nbusiness, that’s just ridiculous.\n\n80\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.810\nThey didn’t validate properly.\n\n81\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the product that they had\nis absolutely beautifully engineered.\n\n82\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.850\nIf you go to the address that is here and\nyou look at how the system breaks apart,\n\n83\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.990\nyou'll see what we're saying.\n\n84\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.900\n&gt;&gt; They had complex castings,\nmassive amounts of engineering\n\n85\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.630\nthat went into an amazing juice press\nThat was totally useless and a failure,\n\n86\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.290\nbut really cool engineering.\n\n87\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.510\nThat's a problem, people.\n\n88\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.500\nThey didn't go out there.\n\n89\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.120\nThey didn't build prototype one.\n\n90\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.800\nThey didn't say hey, do you like it?\n\n91\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.020\nThen they build prototype two.\n\n92\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.400\nDo you like it even more?\n\n93\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.490\nHey, build prototype three.\n\n94\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.130\nLet's iterate through the solutions.\n\n95\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.709\nSo, let's talk about those types of\nthings you can do, the iterations.\n\n96\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.180\nSo if you've got an idea,\nyou need to validate the idea.\n\n97\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.590\nWho has the problem?\n\n98\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.910\nAre there enough people?\n\n99\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.990\nDo they need a solution?\n\n100\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.690\nDo they even care?\n\n101\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.130\nThey might have the problem,\nand it might be so\n\n102\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.410\nminiscule, they just don't care, okay?\n\n103\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.810\nWould they use your solution?\n\n104\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.510\nHey, look at my product,\nwould you use this?\n\n105\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.160\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n106\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.290\nThat's validation.\n\n107\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.060\nOkay?\n\n108\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.450\nWould you pay for it?\n\n109\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.150\nYeah.\nI'd give you $1,000 a month for\n\n110\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.200\nthat product.\n\n111\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.980\nGreat.\n\n112\n00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.930\nWould you mind signing a check for\n$1,000 for your first month's bill?\n\n113\n00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.890\nAnd obviously you know, you wont\nget a product for three months, but\n\n114\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.550\nyou'll be the first to get it.\n\n115\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.070\nHas anybody heard of Kickstarter?\n\n116\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's funny that you'd\nsay that because that really goes into\n\n117\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.190\ndetermining how much funding you\nactually need for your prototype.\n\n118\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.410\nSo, how much is the code?\n\n119\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.190\nHow much is the hardware?\n\n120\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.460\nHow much in cloud assets,\nare you using the cloud?\n\n121\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.995\nDo you need the cloud because the cloud\nis really somebody else's computer,okay.\n\n122\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.880\nHow many people do you\nneed to back this up?\n\n123\n00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.417\nWhat does your UI UX look like?\n\n124\n00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:50.925\nAnd then you double and\ntriple that amount because, let's face it,\n\n125\n00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:53.805\na lot of people just don't\nget the estimation correct.\n\n126\n00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:56.388\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Estimates are tough, man,\n\n127\n00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:57.760\nestimates are tough.\n\n128\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.390\nIt's gonna take a developer\nlike three days.\n\n129\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.560\nAnd when you get a developer and they go,\n\n130\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.570\nit's gonna take two weeks, you just\nblew your estimate out of the water.\n\n131\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nyou know what's more difficult?\n\n132\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.760\nGetting somebody to actually write\nthe check, stroke the check.\n\n133\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.380\n&gt;&gt; Dear God, that's not a joke.\n\n134\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.474\nI remember that the first people you\nnormally get checks from are the three F,\n\n135\n00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:19.246\nand that's family, friends, and fools.\n\n136\n00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.570\nAnd that's actually a term of art,\nit's not a joke.\n\n137\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.510\nThat's the first round of funding,\nfamily, friends, and fools.\n\n138\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.590\nAnd if you can get money from them, great.\n\n139\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.440\nI prefer to get it from\nperspective customers.\n\n140\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.020\nI prefer to give them a prototype,\nshow them an idea, and\n\n141\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.320\nsay would you sign a check?\n\n142\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.710\nBecause let's be honest, if they're\nwilling to put a check out there right now\n\n143\n00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.046\nfor that idea, that means your idea is\nthat good that they're that excited and\n\n144\n00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:42.839\nthat to me is the perfect form of funding.\n\n145\n00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.020\nThat's what Kickstart and GoFundMe and\nall those guys came around with.\n\n146\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's the epitome of prototyping.\n\n147\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.400\nRight, and prototyping is\nactually what's next here, right.\n\n148\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.070\nAre you letting someone use it, right.\n\n149\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.120\nSo do people have questions\nthat have been answered\n\n150\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.560\nabout the prototype itself, right.\n\n151\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.490\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean, so\nyou got validation for you idea.\n\n152\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.380\nIf you got validation for you idea,\nnow you've got names, addresses,\n\n153\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.920\npeople that answered questions.\n\n154\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.250\nThey're the validators.\n\n155\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.120\nIf you go, hey you answered\nsome questions and she said,\n\n156\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.850\nyou'd be interested in using it.\n\n157\n00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.610\nYou want to?\n\n158\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.390\nAnd they go, that be awesome.\n\n159\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.280\nGreat!\n\n160\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.420\nOkay, would you be\ninterested in paying for it?\n\n161\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.330\nWhy yeah, I would, here is money.\n\n162\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.680\nThen your post revenue.\n\n163\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.530\nThat's great.\n\n164\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.450\nRemember, a single dollar\nmeans your post revenue.\n\n165\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.730\nI had an advisor that\nsaid gets $5 on somebody.\n\n166\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.130\nWhat?\nJust get $5.00 then you post revenue.\n\n167\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.980\nIt's kinda faking it but let's be honest.\n\n168\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.550\nAny money at all means you post revenue,\nokay?\n\n169\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.570\nAnd for a 99 cent game that means you've\ngot five customers if you've got $5.00.\n\n170\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.720\nNot bad.\n\n171\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.134\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time keeping\nin mind the whole adage of,\n\n172\n00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:49.338\nyou fake it till you make it doesn't hurt,\nright?\n\n173\n00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:54.384\nIt might not be the best way to go about\ndoing things, but it doesn't hurt, right?\n\n174\n00:07:54.384 --> 00:07:58.442\nSo what also doesn't hurt is\nthat it's validation Right, so\n\n175\n00:07:58.442 --> 00:08:01.651\neven when you had the idea,\nyou got validation.\n\n176\n00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:04.028\nNow that you have the prototype,\ngo back and get more validation.\n\n177\n00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:06.490\nDoes it actually solve the problem?\n\n178\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.270\nGive me honest feedback, do you think\nit sucks, do you think it's amazing,\n\n179\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.430\ndo you think it's wonderful,\n\n180\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.240\ndo you think it could need some\nimprovement, how could it be improved?\n\n181\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.320\nHow can I iterate this?\n\n182\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.830\nHow can I do this better?\n\n183\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.780\nPlease, give me your honest opinion.\n\n184\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.030\nIf you get that from people,\nyou are doing amazingly well.\n\n185\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.270\nBecause a, it means that you've built\na product that has some improvement\n\n186\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.045\npossibilities, that's wonderful.\n\n187\n00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:30.935\nB, it means you've built a pool of people\nwho will give you honest feedback and\n\n188\n00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.265\nthat is incredibly valuable.\n\n189\n00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:36.475\nAnd c, hopefully, it means you've built\na pool of people who will give you money,\n\n190\n00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:39.525\nas well, which we all know\nis not a bad thing to have.\n\n191\n00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:44.165\n&gt;&gt; Now, if I have a prototype, Josh, is\nthere a way that I would be able to take\n\n192\n00:08:44.165 --> 00:08:49.020\na prototype and get money up front to be\nable to increase volume, increase sales,\n\n193\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.000\nand so on and so forth?\n\n194\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.490\nHow would I go about doing that?\n\n195\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.310\n&gt;&gt; Well you can sell features that are\ngonna come down the pike in three months,\n\n196\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.780\nsix months, a year, whatever.\n\n197\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.270\nYou can put bounties out there.\n\n198\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.270\nWhat a bounty is,\nanybody that wants this feature,\n\n199\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.180\nthis benefit in my product,\npay upfront and we'll start building it.\n\n200\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.530\n&gt;&gt; So is that the same thing as, I don't\nknow, angel funding or seed funding?\n\n201\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.620\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, totally different,\ntotally different.\n\n202\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.790\nAngel and\nseed funding is investing in your company.\n\n203\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.460\nThey're taking a piece of your company\nequity in return for money, okay?\n\n204\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.630\nWhat a bounty program does, and this is\nnot a bug bounty that's totally different.\n\n205\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.000\nWhat a feature bounty program does is,\nsay, hey, I want the ability for\n\n206\n00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.600\ngrammar checking, I'm making stuff up,\nI want the ability for grammar checking.\n\n207\n00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.480\nAnybody that wants that put $5,000 up.\n\n208\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.380\nThat's how much it'll cost to code it up.\n\n209\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.640\nAnd we'll add it to the program and\nyou get it first for 30 days,\n\n210\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.840\na year, whatever.\n\n211\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.190\nOr, you just have the feature that\nyou wanted that's worth it to you.\n\n212\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.160\nSo there's plenty of ways to get\nfunding out of potential customers, or\n\n213\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.410\nout of current customers, without\nbeing rude, being very, very popular.\n\n214\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.530\nThese are lovely programs,\n\n215\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.520\nthey work really well too, depending\non your product and things like that.\n\n216\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's funny that you\nhad mentioned customers, okay?\n\n217\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.170\nHow many times have you been in front of\na customer that wants to stroke a check?\n\n218\n00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.760\nBut you've gone out and you've done\nresearch on that customer and said,\n\n219\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.408\nyou know this really\ndoesn't fit what I want.\n\n220\n00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:13.020\n&gt;&gt; So, it depends.\n\n221\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.930\nWhat I mean by that is there\nare customers you don't wanna have.\n\n222\n00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.490\nThere are customers that are gonna take\nmore time in support, more time in\n\n223\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.440\ntraining, more time in, whatever, than the\nprofit you're going to make off of them.\n\n224\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.960\nNow, they might still be worth it.\n\n225\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.840\nGauge this carefully.\n\n226\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.670\nIf it's a huge company and\n\n227\n00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.360\nthey're willing to give you\na massively powerful recommendation,\n\n228\n00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.230\nthen it might be worth it for the add-on\nbusiness you'll get from other customers.\n\n229\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.270\nIf they're a small company that nobody\nknows about and they're gonna take so\n\n230\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.750\nmuch of your time,\nbecause even in the prototype phase,\n\n231\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.000\nthey didn't give you feedback,\nbut they wanted more from you,\n\n232\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.710\nit might not be worth your time\nto deal with them as a customer.\n\n233\n00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.870\nBut you need to get\nreferences from people.\n\n234\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.130\nReferences are actually worth dollars.\n\n235\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.400\nThere's no real way to gauge that.\n\n236\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.970\nIt's really going to be your gut, but\nif you can get a reference from a big\n\n237\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.500\npowerful company that says, this is\nan amazing product, go spend money on it.\n\n238\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.390\nThat might be millions\nof dollars of business.\n\n239\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.770\nIs it worth losing $10,000 a year\nto have them as a customer?\n\n240\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.670\nProbably.\n\n241\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.250\nIt all depends on who the customer is,\n\n242\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.520\nhow powerful they are in that vertical,\nall that kinds of things.\n\n243\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.140\nBut again, what ever you do,\nif you have some customers now,\n\n244\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.210\nand that is the stage you're at,\ngo get more.\n\n245\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.590\nGo find the verticals\nthat you can work in.\n\n246\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.330\nGo find those verticals and\ngo hammer on them hard.\n\n247\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.640\nFigure out if you're better selling\nto small or large companies.\n\n248\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.410\nFigure out if you're better at\nselling to the mid cap market.\n\n249\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.930\nGo get venture capital funding to\nsupport full scale manufacturing.\n\n250\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.030\nGo get things done.\n\n251\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so venture capitalism, let's\ntalk about that for a quick second, okay?\n\n252\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; When is it a good\n\n253\n00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.850\npoint to start seeking VC funding?\n\n254\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.320\nIs it six months down the road,\nis it three months down the road,\n\n255\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.060\nis it ten years down the road?\n\n256\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.440\nDoes it all depend on the business?\n\n257\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.990\nBecause without customers, this is hard.\n\n258\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.730\nWith customers, it's even more\ndifficult because of the iterations.\n\n259\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.730\nSo VC funding actually will\nhelp in this instance,\n\n260\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.990\nbut when is it a good time to go after VC?\n\n261\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwe actually cover that in a later talk,\n\n262\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.270\nbut we'll go over it really quickly here.\n\n263\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.750\nVC funding is a multi tier,\nmulti stage piece.\n\n264\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.370\nYou have Angel, you have Seed,\nyou have A Round, you have B Round,\n\n265\n00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.460\nyou have Bridge funding, you have all\nkinds of funding that's out there.\n\n266\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.070\nAnd some of it's incredibly useful and\n\n267\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.250\nsome of it's actually\ndegrading to your business.\n\n268\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.950\nIt doesn't work well for your business.\n\n269\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.860\nIt's gonna depend on who you are,\nwhat stage you're in.\n\n270\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.750\nIt's gonna depend on a lot of things.\n\n271\n00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.260\nIf you wanna get angel funding,\nit used to be, I'm sorry,\n\n272\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.380\nI'm gonna have to go into history here.\n\n273\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.380\nBut it used to be that you would get\nangel funding when you had an idea and\n\n274\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.010\nyou were ready to bring that idea\nto fruition with a prototype.\n\n275\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.500\nAnd the angel funding got you\nthrough building the prototype.\n\n276\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.630\nIt got you through doing the things that\nyou needed to do to build the prototype,\n\n277\n00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.810\nhave something in hand, or in code,\ndepending if it's software or\n\n278\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.110\nhardware product.\n\n279\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.530\nAnd then start being able to sell\nit to get you to the point of MVP,\n\n280\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.410\nminimum viable product.\n\n281\n00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:05.730\nNow, the investors have\nmoved to the right.\n\n282\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.490\nWhat that means is instead of Angel\nseed abc, they're mostly in as and bs.\n\n283\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.250\nThere's very few angel funders that\nare doing what they used to do,\n\n284\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.330\nwhich is write a cheque almost at the mere\nmention of a good idea with a good team.\n\n285\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.880\nNowadays, they want faster\nreturn on investment,\n\n286\n00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.328\nwhich means going later in the life cycle\nof a company, and they want less risk.\n\n287\n00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:26.730\nThey wanna de-risk, that's another term\nof ours, they wanna de-risk the equation.\n\n288\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.740\nSo they want an experienced team\nwith traction on their product,\n\n289\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.310\nsales already done,\nbefore they'll start the check.\n\n290\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.060\n&gt;&gt;

Okay, so I have this MVP.\n\n440\n00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:52.653\nMy real question is how do I pay for\nit all, right?\n\n441\n00:20:52.653 --> 00:20:57.321\nSo what I'm looking to do as a CEO is say,\nput things on credit cards,\n\n442\n00:20:57.321 --> 00:21:01.520\nmortgage, beg, borrow, but\nplease don't steal, right?\n\n443\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.200\nThat's a big one,\nI can't stress that enough.\n\n444\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.216\nYour friends and family are investors,\nif the idea's infectious enough and\n\n445\n00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:09.647\nyou can get across to them.\n\n446\n00:21:09.647 --> 00:21:13.961\nYour day job, okay, keep that until\nyou're ready, but realistically,\n\n447\n00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:15.476\nwho needs sleep, right?\n\n448\n00:21:15.476 --> 00:21:22.407\nWhen we're talking about putting things\non beg, borrow and credit cards, right?\n\n449\n00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.443\nIf you have a contract,\nmore than likely most banks,\n\n450\n00:21:25.443 --> 00:21:27.810\nif you take them a contract and say, yes.\n\n451\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:32.263\nThey have signed for this many units the\nbank will actually work with you to give\n\n452\n00:21:32.263 --> 00:21:34.835\nyou a loan against what\nthe contract states.\n\n453\n00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:37.913\n&gt;&gt; Now be careful because if they\nbreak the contract, you've just lost\n\n454\n00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:41.710\nthe collateral for your loan and\nthe bank's gonna call it right now.\n\n455\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.990\nSo make sure that you have an iron\nclad contract with penalties and\n\n456\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.300\nthings like that.\n\n457\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.395\nDo whatever you can to make sure that\nthey can't break that contract and\n\n458\n00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.365\nthat they absolutely adore you, all right?\n\n459\n00:21:51.365 --> 00:21:56.420\nKeep your day job until you have somewhere\nwhere you can stand fairly well secure.\n\n460\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.791\nIf you have to remortgage your house to do\nsomething that you're not 100% sure of,\n\n461\n00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:02.206\nI'd have a real problem signing\nthat paperwork, all right?\n\n462\n00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:02.821\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n463\n00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:03.726\n&gt;&gt; Be careful please.\n\n464\n00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:09.030\n&gt;&gt; So I don't mean to cut you off here,\nbut doing all this is just\n\n465\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:16.108\ngonna drive us completely not being in\nthe entrepreneurial lifecycle, right?\n\n466\n00:22:16.108 --> 00:22:19.260\nOf product creation with the seven\nsteps that we're laying out.\n\n467\n00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.067\nIt's really easy to lose\nsight of what's going on.\n\n468\n00:22:24.067 --> 00:22:28.623\n&gt;&gt; Well true, but I mean you gotta have\nstages, you gotta go through this.\n\n469\n00:22:28.623 --> 00:22:32.790\nAnd first you start off with the proble,\n.I can't do this, I need a solution.\n\n470\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.720\nIt's something that a lot of successful\nentrepreneurs start with the problem\n\n471\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.400\nthey are personally experiencing.\n\n472\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.247\nWhether it's something in their job\nworkflow, whether it's a problem at work,\n\n473\n00:22:41.247 --> 00:22:42.763\nwhether its something at home.\n\n474\n00:22:42.763 --> 00:22:45.894\nThe guy who came up with the hot dog bun\nsteamer with hot dog cooker didn't do it.\n\n475\n00:22:45.894 --> 00:22:47.665\nBecause he'd never cooked hot dogs or\n\n476\n00:22:47.665 --> 00:22:49.944\ngot annoyed at the grill\ntrying to cook hot dogs.\n\n477\n00:22:49.944 --> 00:22:51.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He had a problem,\n\n478\n00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.640\nso he came up with something\nto fix that problem.\n\n479\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.213\nSo he said, I've got a problem,\nI'm gonna build a solution.\n\n480\n00:22:56.213 --> 00:22:58.088\nHe goes wow, this solution really works.\n\n481\n00:22:58.088 --> 00:22:59.667\nDoes anybody else have this problem?\n\n482\n00:22:59.667 --> 00:23:02.594\nDoes anybody else like to cook hot\ndogs and buns at the same time?\n\n483\n00:23:02.594 --> 00:23:06.367\nAnd he got 15,000 people to say,\nyes, I love it, it's a great idea.\n\n484\n00:23:06.367 --> 00:23:07.732\nAnd he goes, wow.\n\n485\n00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:09.083\n&gt;&gt; I'm onto something.\n\n486\n00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:10.121\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go build-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n487\n00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:12.430\n&gt;&gt; This thing, that sounds good to me.\n\n488\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.492\nSo he built it and he prototyped it,\nand he sold prototypes like crazy.\n\n489\n00:23:16.492 --> 00:23:18.386\nAnd I'm picking on this,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n490\n00:23:18.386 --> 00:23:21.701\nHe sold prototypes like crazy, and\nthat's when you start seeing wow,\n\n491\n00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:24.290\nI might actually be\na successful entrepreneur.\n\n492\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.128\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when you're successful the\nreal question is where do we go from here,\n\n493\n00:23:29.128 --> 00:23:29.645\nright?\n\n494\n00:23:29.645 --> 00:23:35.663\nSo there's a lot of ingredients\nthat go into a product, right?\n\n495\n00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:40.041\n&gt;&gt; Look, you've got everything from\nthe original problem, the solution,\n\n496\n00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:44.571\nwho's spending what, who is the audience\nfor the problem and the solution?\n\n497\n00:23:44.571 --> 00:23:48.588\nWhat technology are you using,\nwhat outside influences, competitors,\n\n498\n00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:50.957\npublicity, all kinds of things like that.\n\n499\n00:23:50.957 --> 00:23:52.459\nWhat's your roadmap?\n\n500\n00:23:52.459 --> 00:23:53.305\nWhat are you gonna be building?\n\n501\n00:23:53.305 --> 00:23:54.960\nWhat features are you gonna be adding?\n\n502\n00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.770\nWhat channels?\n\n503\n00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.404\nWhat pieces?\n\n504\n00:23:56.404 --> 00:23:56.958\nWhat parts?\n\n505\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:57.617\nWhat functions?\n\n506\n00:23:57.617 --> 00:23:58.780\nWhat benefits?\n\n507\n00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.540\nAre you gonna be adding on to your product\nto make it even better down the road?\n\n508\n00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.422\nThat's why they call it a roadmap.\n\n509\n00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:07.368\nAll of these matter in terms of building a\nprototype, in terms of building a product.\n\n510\n00:24:07.368 --> 00:24:12.280\nIn terms of getting your product from\nI have a problem to I have successful\n\n511\n00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.900\nbusiness, okay?\n\n512\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:19.150\nAnd if you're not paying attention to\nall of these things all of the time,\n\n513\n00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.211\nyou're going to fail, so pay attention.\n\n514\n00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:25.421\n&gt;&gt;

So, my name is Joshua Marpet.\n\n11\n00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:36.775\nI'm the COO of Red Lion.\n\n12\n00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:40.155\nAnd we're here at BizProTV to\ntalk about operational status.\n\n13\n00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:41.595\nAnd we've talked about\na lot of different things.\n\n14\n00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:44.625\nWe wrote up all these business for\ntechnologists talks because the failures\n\n15\n00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:47.535\nthat we've had and the issues and\nproblems we've had.\n\n16\n00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:50.975\nBecause, well,\nwe've done a lot of business stuff before.\n\n17\n00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:54.810\nAlong the way, let's see,\nI've been a blacksmith, a cop, a fireman.\n\n18\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.770\nI've done just about everything\nthere is to do, save astronaut and\n\n19\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.360\nI swear I'm working on that.\n\n20\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.610\nSo, let's get started.\n\n21\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.860\nSo in this series we talk about everything\nfrom how to start a business from\n\n22\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.150\nan idea all the way through to exit.\n\n23\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.550\nThat's building a product, having an idea,\ngetting a product working, making a sale.\n\n24\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.580\nAll the way to running\nyour sales managing team.\n\n25\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.790\nAnd, well, like we said,\nexiting the company,\n\n26\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.070\nhopefully with a wad of\ncash in your pocket.\n\n27\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.990\nToday, operational status,\n[COUGH] our third talk in this series,\n\n28\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.280\nis about what you do\nonce you've made a sale.\n\n29\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.450\nNow what do you do after that?\n\n30\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.240\n&gt;&gt; And so operational status really\nstarts with the prototype, right?\n\n31\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.260\nEverything you do with the business\nstarts with the prototype.\n\n32\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.433\nFrom there, you need to get pilot,\nbeta sales,\n\n33\n00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.530\nyou need to become production ready.\n\n34\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.600\nYou need to do little bit of this\nthing called manufacturing, right?\n\n35\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.350\nLittle step details, and then you need\nto maintenance on your product, right?\n\n36\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.450\nSo under prototype,\nwhat are you looking to do?\n\n37\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.970\nYou are looking to build your code.\n\n38\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.510\nYou are looking to minimum viable product.\n\n39\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.560\nYou're looking to validate your solution\nbecause validation really tells you that\n\n40\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.040\nyou're on to the right track.\n\n41\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.730\nYou're looking to create your solution,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.270\nAfter you've validated, you may need\nto recreate because of iteration.\n\n43\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.160\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n44\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nhave you adequately defined the problem?\n\n45\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.880\nSo the prototype that you've built does it\nmeet what the actual problem is, right?\n\n46\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.800\nAnd then you move into pilot, beta sales.\n\n47\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n48\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.330\nthis whole cycle that we have on screen\nnow is something that we came up with.\n\n49\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.860\nIt's not like it's totally original to us,\nbut putting it into this format is.\n\n50\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370\nWe realized that everything\nyou do is an iteration.\n\n51\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.340\nAnd every iteration then\nfeeds the next phase.\n\n52\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.207\nSo everything is sort of like a multi\nroundabout which they have in England and\n\n53\n00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:36.320\nthey're terrifying.\n\n54\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.040\nBut anyway, in the business format,\nit's much better.\n\n55\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.580\nSo you build your prototype,\nyou go to your pilot, beta sales.\n\n56\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.990\nYou validate your business case, you get\naccess to the validators to the solution.\n\n57\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.120\nYou actually get feedback and\n\n58\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.420\nrebuild again and you'll keep iterating\nthere until you go to the next thing.\n\n59\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.610\nWhich is I'm production ready.\n\n60\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.380\nWow, production ready,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n61\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.890\nProduction ready means I'm ready to go and\nsell it on a mass scale, okay?\n\n62\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.190\nAnd manufacture in large quantities.\n\n63\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.010\nAnd then, as Scott said,\nwe go to maintenance.\n\n64\n00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.760\nSo let's move on and\nlet's start with, prototyping.\n\n65\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.290\nSo what is prototyping?\n\n66\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.710\nWell, prototype is the original,\nit's the representative model.\n\n67\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.150\nIt's what I'm gonna start with.\n\n68\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.560\nIt's what I hand to a validator and\nI say, hey, do you like this?\n\n69\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.210\nDoes it work?\n\n70\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.260\nIs it going well for you?\n\n71\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.340\nAnd if they go, yes,\nwell, that's fantastic.\n\n72\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.520\nSo then, it works out very well.\n\n73\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.030\nAnd we can do that and move on.\n\n74\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.160\nBut to start a prototype,\nyou have to have a problem to go from.\n\n75\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.500\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat's really wrong with your problem?\n\n76\n00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.240\nWhat is your objective?\n\n77\n00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.760\nWhat are you trying to build\nyour prototype around, right?\n\n78\n00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.490\nWhat is really driving the question?\n\n79\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.120\n&gt;&gt; And that's the big problem.\n\n80\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.640\nYou've got a problem.\n\n81\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.540\nYou've gotta be able\nto define the problem.\n\n82\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.840\nYou've gotta be able to solve the problem.\n\n83\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.860\nYou've gotta be able to have the solution\nnecessities, what are the prerequisites?\n\n84\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.100\nWhat hardware do you need?\n\n85\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.960\nWhat software do you need?\n\n86\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.560\nWhat do I need to build\na healthy solution?\n\n87\n00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.750\nThat kind of thing.\n\n88\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.430\nThese are all different things that,\n\n89\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.760\nagain, even after you've made your\nfirst sale, reiterate, rebuild, redo.\n\n90\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.620\nStart from scratch,\nthrow out all your numbers and try again.\n\n91\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.630\nMake sure you haven't missed a piece of\nresearch that you could do that could\n\n92\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.150\nthree or four or five fold your\nsolution volume or profit or margin or\n\n93\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.140\nwhatever tomorrow.\n\n94\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.780\nSo, again, I know we're harping\non this and beating a dead horse.\n\n95\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.640\nBut it's important that you understand\nwhat's going on with your solution at\n\n96\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.430\nevery stage of the game.\n\n97\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.610\nAnd that you keep\nreiterating your research,\n\n98\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.619\nyour validation,\nyour problem and solution.\n\n99\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.700\n&gt;&gt; So if you've been following\nalong in our series like we\n\n100\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.210\nlike to think that you have.\n\n101\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.980\nYou've already seen our\nlittle spill about the MVP,\n\n102\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.760\nwhich is the minimum viable product,\nright?\n\n103\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.650\nWhich you see here, small,\nsimple, smooth, steps, right?\n\n104\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.588\n&gt;&gt; Every step should be able to be sold.\n\n105\n00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:00.594\nI can sell a skateboard.\n\n106\n00:05:00.594 --> 00:05:01.520\nI can sell a scooter.\n\n107\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.960\nI can sell a bike.\n\n108\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.630\nI can't sell the frame of\na car without an actual car.\n\n109\n00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.190\nIf I can't sell something,\nI can't iterate something.\n\n110\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.350\nUnless you're Elon Musk, or\nsomething like that, Steve Jobs perhaps,\n\n111\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.250\nyou can't conceive of the finished\nproduct that will sell for a $1,000 and\n\n112\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.960\nI'll sell 10 million units, and it'll\nbe perfect, and get there in first try.\n\n113\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.473\nYou have to start with\nsomething that sells for $10,\n\n114\n00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:32.660\n$100, $15, whatever, and is perfect for\nthis small limited application.\n\n115\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.890\nAnd then you iterate to expand\nthe applications it's useful for,\n\n116\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.560\nto expand the price,\nto expand the complexity.\n\n117\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.300\nBut I guarantee you, if you start off\ntrying to build a car first thing,\n\n118\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.390\nit's not gonna work very well.\n\n119\n00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.740\n&gt;&gt; So, where's does the theory of\niteration coming to play, right?\n\n120\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.140\nWell, that really comes in with\nvalidating the solution, right?\n\n121\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.870\nSo, does the solution meet your needs?\n\n122\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.736\nLet's walk through the scenario that\nJosh just spoke about which is sell for\n\n123\n00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:01.030\n$10, $15, $20, $30 a unit, right?\n\n124\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.600\nWell, each time you increase your price,\nyou're pivoting and\n\n125\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.590\nyou're making that unit be\nmore sellable to the market,\n\n126\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.540\nthe total addressable market,\nthat we went over in the last talk.\n\n127\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you've gotta make sure\nthat as you increase your price,\n\n128\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.660\nyou're increasing the benefits.\n\n129\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.590\nYou're increasing the problems that,\nthat solution can address.\n\n130\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.300\nYou're increasing what you're doing for\nyour customers.\n\n131\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.090\nYou're increasing the things that work and\nmake sense and benefit them with value.\n\n132\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.770\nYou're doing value add,\nit's as simple as that.\n\n133\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.440\nBut, strangely enough,\npeople don't get that.\n\n134\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.180\nSo we find the need to reiterate\nthat often in our presentations.\n\n135\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.130\n&gt;&gt; So the big question here is, does\nyour product actually solve the problem?\n\n136\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.290\nAre you the only one having the problem?\n\n137\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.160\nBecause let's face it, there are a lot of\npeople out there that have problems but\n\n138\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.640\nthey don't want to talk about it.\n\n139\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.090\nSo therefore they live in a vacuum,\n\n140\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.430\nnobody knows, people just move on\nwith a very bad idea or product.\n\n141\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.180\nThey don't get it.\n\n142\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.400\n&gt;&gt; I mean, and if nobody sees the value,\nyou're not going to sell.\n\n143\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.222\nIt's just that simple, if nobody sees\nthe value you're not gonna sell.\n\n144\n00:07:07.222 --> 00:07:10.676\nAnd if you can't provide value with\nthe resources you have available to you,\n\n145\n00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:13.707\nif you can't build a solution with\nwhat you have available, well,\n\n146\n00:07:13.707 --> 00:07:17.639\nyou can go look for more resources, that's\nknown as friend capital, family capital,\n\n147\n00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.320\ncredit cards,\nmortgage your house, whatever.\n\n148\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.510\nBut if you can't do it, you can't do it.\n\n149\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.311\nYou need to have a product that solves\na problem with the resources you have now\n\n150\n00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:28.241\nthat other people will see the value and\n\n151\n00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:31.132\ndo this magic thing called pay\nyou money for the solution.\n\n152\n00:07:31.132 --> 00:07:35.370\n&gt;&gt; So we've gone over, does your\nproduct actually solve the problem?\n\n153\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.610\nBut how does this all play together\ninto pilot, beta sales, right?\n\n154\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.356\nWell, the real goal here is to\nvalidate your business case and\n\n155\n00:07:43.356 --> 00:07:46.040\nto grant validator access to the solution.\n\n156\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.924\nWe'll cover that in-depth\nhere in quick second.\n\n157\n00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:52.580\nBut out of all of this, get the feedback,\nbecause the feedback really tells you\n\n158\n00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.031\nwhere you need to pivot, or any type\nof features, or value added benefits,\n\n159\n00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.415\nthat you need to bake into your product.\n\n160\n00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:04.280\nRemember, the magic word is iterate and\nwe're gonna harp on that over and\n\n161\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.250\nover and over and over.\n\n162\n00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.890\nBut if you don't iterate, if you don't\nfind out what they're thinking, and\n\n163\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.430\nfix your product to meet\nwhat their needs are,\n\n164\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.870\nthen you're never gonna make a good\nsale or a good amount of sales.\n\n165\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.572\nSo that get feedback and iterate,\ntalk about a dead horse,\n\n166\n00:08:21.572 --> 00:08:24.240\nwe're gonna hit that probably in\nevery presentation in everything we\n\n167\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.860\never do in BizProTV in everything,\nbecause iteration is what it's all about.\n\n168\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's take a current product\nthat's already out on the market,\n\n169\n00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:32.920\nlike the iPhone, right?\n\n170\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.270\nIf the iPhone had stayed in it's original\nconcept, would it have been as successful\n\n171\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.640\nor helped to add value to Apple's\nbusiness the way that it has?\n\n172\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.638\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean it was wonderful in\nthe day, but today the original iPhone,\n\n173\n00:08:45.638 --> 00:08:48.428\nI mean, you couldn't sell that for\nlove or money.\n\n174\n00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:53.114\nEven the cheap ones that they're selling\nin third world countries are three or\n\n175\n00:08:53.114 --> 00:08:56.610\nfour generations newer\nthan the original iPhone.\n\n176\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.600\nHeck, the original iPhones don't even\nwork anymore because they were 2G phones?\n\n177\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They were 2G phones,\n\n178\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.020\n2G isn't even on in this country and\nmost countries around the world, so\n\n179\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.190\nyou couldn't even use it.\n\n180\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.050\nI mean, It'd be the equivalent\nof a Palm Pilot, and\n\n181\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.370\nhow many of those are sold nowadays?\n\n182\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny that you say that,\n\n183\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.890\nbecause it brings up a really good point\nin that, would you really buy this?\n\n184\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.918\n&gt;&gt; Well, not any more, they iterated,\nnow the iPhone, what is it, the 7?\n\n185\n00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:20.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The latest one, the iPhone 7.\n\n186\n00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:23.974\n&gt;&gt; 7, 8, soon to be the X,\nthe iPhone X, yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:23.974 --> 00:09:25.720\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know that, very cool.\n\n188\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.820\n&gt;&gt; It's coming.\n\n189\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.880\n&gt;&gt; So the iPhone X is coming, and those\nsolutions, those iterations have brought\n\n190\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.860\nincredible advancement in value, in\nbenefits, in features to the iOS platform.\n\n191\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.240\nIncluding bringing iOS to not only\nthe Macintosh laptops with the App Store,\n\n192\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.060\nbut in some sort of limited form.\n\n193\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.490\nBut iOS on tablets,\nthe iPad and the iPad Pro,\n\n194\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.260\none of which is right\nhere as a matter of fact.\n\n195\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.890\nWe've got iOS all over the place and all\nkinds of hardware platforms, shall I say.\n\n196\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.850\nAnd it works out well, so\nthey've taken that solution and they've,\n\n197\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.585\nwhat's that magic word, iterated,\nthat's right, that's the magic word.\n\n198\n00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:05.560\nThey've iterated it out into different\nplatforms, different value platforms,\n\n199\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.350\ndifferent ways to use it.\n\n200\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.414\nAnd they've changed the pricing\npoint significantly over time,\n\n201\n00:10:10.414 --> 00:10:14.240\nthey've put it on low-cost price points,\nthey've put it on high price points.\n\n202\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.341\nThey've got luxury price points for\nGod sakes, they got everything.\n\n203\n00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:20.240\nSo how much would you pay,\nyou only have $300,\n\n204\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.950\nwe've got a price point for\nyou, we've got one over here.\n\n205\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.638\n&gt;&gt; Right, but the real question is\nwould you pay for it right now, okay?\n\n206\n00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:31.870\nAgain, there's a little-known concept\ncalled the need versus the want, right?\n\n207\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.453\nDo you need something or\ndo you want something, right?\n\n208\n00:10:34.453 --> 00:10:40.010\nAnd so [COUGH] when you're dealing\nwith the need versus the want,\n\n209\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.600\ndo you need a phone right now or\ndo you want a phone right now?\n\n210\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Well okay, so I need a phone,\nI mean, I'm important, I need a phone.\n\n211\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.699\nLet's be honest here, so I have to have\na phone, it's just part of who I am.\n\n212\n00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:54.208\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n213\n00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:56.760\n&gt;&gt; But realistically,\nsorry, I couldn't resist.\n\n214\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.690\nBut realistically, you've got the thing,\nyou need the smart phone?\n\n215\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.847\nDo you need one that you can conduct\nbusiness on and all the people do.\n\n216\n00:11:01.847 --> 00:11:03.763\nAs a matter of fact, I always tell people,\n\n217\n00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.550\nI can pretty much conduct my\nentire business on a smartphone.\n\n218\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.920\nI carry a keyboard around with me as\na matter of fact, to do that with.\n\n219\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.970\nBut the thing with pilots and betas is,\nyou've gotta give people access to it.\n\n220\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.230\nIf you don't give people access to it,\nlike access to the new version of your\n\n221\n00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.260\nsmartphone, access to the keyboard to let\nthem see if they can do their business on\n\n222\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.080\nthe smartphone, or whatever,\nthen it's worthless.\n\n223\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.900\nBecause you can't iterate\nwithout feedback, feedback is so\n\n224\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.400\nimportant to iteration.\n\n225\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.500\nI know, I told you I would harp on\nit like a dead horse, didn't I?\n\n226\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.750\nSo you've gotta get references\nfrom your pilots, from your betas.\n\n227\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.520\nYou've gotta make sure that they love it,\nyou've gotta get that feedback.\n\n228\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.090\nSo now you've got a select group\nof people who you're close to,\n\n229\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.565\nwho you have relationships with,\nyou've given them your solution.\n\n230\n00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:47.225\nYou're saying hey, take a look at this,\ntell me what you think?\n\n231\n00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:51.555\nPay me some money for it,\nbecause now I'm post revenue, yay, okay?\n\n232\n00:11:51.555 --> 00:11:55.225\nYou've got referenceable clients, you've\ngot people who are giving you honest,\n\n233\n00:11:55.225 --> 00:11:56.755\nclear feedback.\n\n234\n00:11:56.755 --> 00:12:00.725\nAnd there are people who are solving\ntheir problem with your solution.\n\n235\n00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:02.195\nAnd they're willing to go out there and\n\n236\n00:12:02.195 --> 00:12:04.565\ntell people about it,\nincredibly wonderful.\n\n237\n00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:07.790\n&gt;&gt; So once you get your feedback\nyou say [LAUGH] great, now,\n\n238\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.120\nI need to go to change it, right?\n\n239\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.420\nAdd features, add benefits,\nthat is the sound of inevitability, right?\n\n240\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.030\nI know that was bad, but you get the\npoint, add user experience improvements.\n\n241\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.940\nThe app store for iPhone,\nlet's use that as an example.\n\n242\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.330\n&gt;&gt; It's iterated hundreds of times.\n\n243\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.384\n&gt;&gt; Hundreds of times, and what recently\nhappened with the upgrade iOS 11?\n\n244\n00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:34.910\nWe've seen the first major change\nto the App Store in years.\n\n245\n00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.840\n&gt;&gt; What was the change?\n\n246\n00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.880\n&gt;&gt; The look, the feel,\nthe layout, the UX, the UI.\n\n247\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.520\n&gt;&gt; See, I don't really use many Crapple,\nI mean Apple products.\n\n248\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.960\nSo I really don't know very much\nabout the App Store anymore.\n\n249\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.400\nI had an iPhone 7, and I actually\ngave it back, I went back to Android.\n\n250\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.260\nI was heavily invested\nin the Android universe.\n\n251\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.700\nI normally switch between the Apple and\nAndroid universes every year or two, but.\n\n252\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.399\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let me ask you a question,\nJosh, do people really care?\n\n253\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.051\nNot about what you said about, you know\nswitching between Apple and Android.\n\n254\n00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.634\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you,\nI thought you were insulting me.\n\n255\n00:13:08.634 --> 00:13:12.060\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no really,\nit's more of a status check.\n\n256\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.600\nDo people care about your product?\n\n257\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.930\nDo they care about your pilot?\n\n258\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.950\nDo they care about giving you feedback?\n\n259\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.840\nCuz I know when I have a new update on\niOS, right, I always go for the beta.\n\n260\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.680\nI say, damn the torpedoes, I go for\nthe pilot beta on iOS, and\n\n261\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.930\nI always provide feedback.\n\n262\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.669\nOr I may not, because I don't have time,\ndo people really care?\n\n263\n00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:34.363\n&gt;&gt; Well, It's interesting.\n\n264\n00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:36.636\nIf you've got a good pilot or\nbeta program,\n\n265\n00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:39.280\nyou've got people that\nwill give you feedback.\n\n266\n00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.830\nIf you've got a good pilot or\nbeta program,\n\n267\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.090\nyou've got people that will tell you,\nI'm not willing to spend money on this,\n\n268\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.430\nI don't think it's worthwhile.\n\n269\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.260\nOr that I will spend money on this,\nI think it's fantastic.\n\n270\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.140\nIf you can get them to see the value,\nto move forward,\n\n271\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.950\nto do the right stuff, then it's\nfantastic what you can get out of them.\n\n272\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.590\nIf you can't get them to care,\n\n273\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.490\nthen your product is going to fail,\nit's just that simple.\n\n274\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.110\nSo again, it's an iteration model,\ndo they care?\n\n275\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.690\nYes, do they care enough?\n\n276\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.965\nNot really, let's fix that.\n\n277\n00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:06.298\n&gt;&gt; Well, another point of\ncontention with failure, and\n\n278\n00:14:06.298 --> 00:14:09.607\nit's funny you should bring that up,\nis dealing with the hardware, right?\n\n279\n00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:13.630\nThe hardware and the software, is\nthe hardware ready, is the software ready?\n\n280\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.699\nLet's dive into that a little bit more,\n\n281\n00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:21.666\nbecause it's such an integral\npart when it comes to prototypes,\n\n282\n00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:26.490\nsorry, when it comes to prototypes and\ngetting feedback.\n\n283\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.790\nSo what are your thoughts on this?\n\n284\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay look, when you're gonna go get\nproduction ready, because, my gosh,\n\n285\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.710\nmy pilot has gone so well.\n\n286\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.823\nEverybody is willing to pay me a scad\nof money, a scad is a technical term,\n\n287\n00:14:37.823 --> 00:14:38.865\nI'm kidding, relax.\n\n288\n00:14:38.865 --> 00:14:42.090\n[LAUGH] And I'm gonna get lots of money.\n\n289\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.670\nI've got lots of people that wanna buy,\nI've lots of things gong on.\n\n290\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.840\nThis is fantastic, okay fine.\n\n291\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.470\nTo get ready for manufacturing, it's\na little different than calling your local\n\n292\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.210\nfabricator and saying hey can\nyou build this or duplicate it?\n\n293\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.250\nYou've gotta have a formal bit of\nmaterials, you've gotta find a factory.\n\n294\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.800\nA lot of people go to China for hardware.\n\n295\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.160\nA lot of people use India for\nsoftware creation, or\n\n296\n00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.480\nvarious software creation groups,\ndevelopment groups here in the US.\n\n297\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.200\nYou've got to make sure that you've\ngot SLAs, service level agreements,\n\n298\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.060\nguarantees, warranties.\n\n299\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.950\nYou've got a lot of moving pieces to\nconsider when you actually go for\n\n300\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.362\nmanufacturing.\n\n301\n00:15:14.362 --> 00:15:17.870\nYou've gotta make sure that, for\nexample, I mean here's the simplest one.\n\n302\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.050\nThe pieces that you purchased, bought,\nscrapped, whatever, you were able to sell\n\n303\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.695\nthat at a profit mostly because you're\ntrying just to get the iteration,\n\n304\n00:15:25.695 --> 00:15:27.290\nthe feedback from your people.\n\n305\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.230\nIn a commercial or\nindustrial setting, will the pieces\n\n306\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.550\nthat are needed to build your hardware\ncost more than you want to sell it for?\n\n307\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.550\nI mean, it sounds stupid, but there's\na lot of products that have gone broke\n\n308\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:42.300\nbecause they're like, wow, it actually\ncosts us $300 to build our $250 product.\n\n309\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.360\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n310\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.218\nAnd what was it, pets.com that said,\nwe lose money on every transaction, but\n\n311\n00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:48.850\nwe make it up in volume?\n\n312\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:49.673\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n313\n00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:54.213\nwe cannot under any circumstance\nstress enough to get SLAs,\n\n314\n00:15:54.213 --> 00:15:58.499\nguarantees, and\nwarranties about what you're doing.\n\n315\n00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.476\nWe can't stress that enough.\n\n316\n00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:03.996\nIt's like doing the paperwork that we were\ntalking about in a couple of other of our\n\n317\n00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:07.173\npresentations at the very front,\nmaking sure that everything's done.\n\n318\n00:16:07.173 --> 00:16:11.001\nSo, that way it doesn't come\nto bite you in the end, but\n\n319\n00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:15.415\nwhat it all comes down to is one\nsimple question, will it scale?\n\n320\n00:16:15.415 --> 00:16:18.359\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; But before you worry about scaling,\n\n321\n00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:22.214\nyou've got to make sure that your\ncode is also production ready.\n\n322\n00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.749\nWe talked about hardware,\nbuilding materials and things like that.\n\n323\n00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:28.523\nBut if your code is not documented and\ncommented, if it's not supportable,\n\n324\n00:16:28.523 --> 00:16:32.864\nif you haven't addressed your\ntechnical debt, you're in trouble.\n\n325\n00:16:32.864 --> 00:16:36.790\nSo again, when you talk about hardware,\nyou're talking about building materials.\n\n326\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.900\nWhen you talk about software, you talk\nabout commented/documented code, so\n\n327\n00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.060\nyou can support it.\n\n328\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.750\nYou can make sure that you're not doing\nsomething quick and dirty right now to get\n\n329\n00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.960\nit out the door, that down the road\nyou're gonna spend $1 million to fix.\n\n330\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.230\nThat's called technical debt, okay?\n\n331\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.770\nYou've gotta make sure that your software\nis ready, your hardware is ready,\n\n332\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:58.010\nyour manufacturing is ready, and then, and\nonly then, will you worry about scaling.\n\n333\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's my fault for jumping\nahead because it's actually a really good,\n\n334\n00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.770\nit's actually a really good use case.\n\n335\n00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.620\nJust like we were talking about here, is\nyour hardware correct, will it scale, and\n\n336\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.860\nyou completely forget about one of the\nmost integral steps which is the software.\n\n337\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.740\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right.\n\n338\n00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.580\n&gt;&gt; Software is incredibly important,\nsoftware is the code that either\n\n339\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.910\nruns your hardware, or it's your entire\nproduct is a software-based product.\n\n340\n00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.500\nWhether it's an app, a web system or\n\n341\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.980\neven a backend office system, software\nis kind of a detail thing nowadays.\n\n342\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.410\nWell not a detail, it's kind of important.\n\n343\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.300\nBut the scaling matters for\nboth hardware and software.\n\n344\n00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.580\nIf you're selling five units a month and\nyou all of the sudden get a 10,000\n\n345\n00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.780\nunit order, that's a massive\nscale up in manufacturing.\n\n346\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.280\nThat is gonna change the factory you\ndeal with, the cost of your materials.\n\n347\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.770\nYou might not be able to get enough\nmaterials to do a 10,000 unit order.\n\n348\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.270\nIt just might not be available, okay?\n\n349\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.410\nThe same with software.\n\n350\n00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.470\nWhat if you have, okay, so\nsoftware you can just copy.\n\n351\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.840\nIt's just lines on a hard drive but\nwhat about in terms of support.\n\n352\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.770\nSoftware has massive amounts of support\nissues that you have to deal with.\n\n353\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.820\nIf you have one call a month for support,\nwell, guess what, you can just take it.\n\n354\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.440\nIt's not a problem but all of a sudden,\nyou scale up to 1,000 calls a month.\n\n355\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.350\nYou better have a technical\nsupport organization or\n\n356\n00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.050\nsomebody you can offload that to.\n\n357\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.940\nIt makes a difference, scale is a problem.\n\n358\n00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.300\n&gt;&gt; So when we're talking about going\nfrom five units to 10,000 units,\n\n359\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.360\nisn't that called surging, surge support?\n\n360\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.390\n&gt;&gt; It can be,\nthat's one of the possibilities.\n\n361\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.290\nBut you've also got, there's different\nwords for it, let's put it that way.\n\n362\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.270\nBut I mean basically,\nthe idea of scaling is tough.\n\n363\n00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.800\nYou go from a sample batch\nto testing to certification,\n\n364\n00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.760\nall sorts of problems arise.\n\n365\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.590\nIf I build a wireless box, for\nexample, for a friend, I go hey, Don,\n\n366\n00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.840\nhere's a wireless box.\n\n367\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.600\nYou wanna try it?\n\n368\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.060\nHe goes sure let me play with it.\n\n369\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.620\nhe can play with it in a lab,\nin an experimental format,\n\n370\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.170\nwhen I'm manufacturing one hundred\nthousand of them, I've got to get them FCC\n\n371\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.020\ncertified for wireless, otherwise it's\nillegal for me to manufacture them and\n\n372\n00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.200\nsell them unless they're specifically\ndone in an experimental format,\n\n373\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.880\nand that's, kind of, not easy to do Okay.\n\n374\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.610\nSo it's actually manufacturing adds a lot\nof hurdles that you have to think about.\n\n375\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.230\nYou have to worry about.\n\n376\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.790\nOr at least have the knowledge\nto call somebody and go,\n\n377\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.270\nI know you know this stuff.\n\n378\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.330\nLet's talk.\n\n379\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd that's where the sample batch\n\n380\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.430\ncomes in to place, right.\n\n381\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.400\nLet's make sure that we have\neverything on line ready to go.\n\n382\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.750\nThat you can scale as needed to solution,\nwhether it software or hardware,\n\n383\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.800\nright, let's do a sample build,\nlet's run through the scenario.\n\n384\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.540\n&gt;&gt; I've got a great story for this one,\n\n385\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.730\nfriends of mine were asked by a company,\nwe're thinking about buying and\n\n386\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.290\nacquiring this other company,\nthey have this software product,\n\n387\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.370\nwould you go check them out\n&gt;&gt; Well what do you want us to do?\n\n388\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.470\nWell just make sure that the product\nis mature, that it's solid,\n\n389\n00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.970\nthat it's ready to be scaled-up for\nproduction.\n\n390\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.300\nOkay, sure, no problem.\n\n391\n00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.060\nThey walked in,\n\n392\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.740\nthey did the most brilliant thing\nI've heard of in a long time.\n\n393\n00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.011\nThey asked one question, he went to\nthe dev team and he said, hi, how are you?\n\n394\n00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:57.239\nAnd they introduced everybody, and\nhe goes, do me a favor, kick off a build.\n\n395\n00:19:57.239 --> 00:19:59.210\nThey went, what do you mean?\n\n396\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.740\nHe said, kick off a build,\nyou have software,\n\n397\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.260\nkick off a build of your software,\nlet me see how you build it.\n\n398\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.220\nWell, we don't do that, we have a very\nlong and involved procedure to do a build.\n\n399\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.900\nHe goes, so when you do a code change,\nwhich you should be doing\n\n400\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.330\nhow many times a day, and you can't\nkick off a build of the software?\n\n401\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.310\nThey're like, no,\nit takes about three days to do a build.\n\n402\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.420\nDone, they were done, they left.\n\n403\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.360\nThey were like, not ready,\nit's not production ready.\n\n404\n00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.100\nIt is hobbyist ready, it is sample ready,\nit is not production ready.\n\n405\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.570\n&gt;&gt; So what you're really saying is test,\ntest, test?\n\n406\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Test and\nbuild like you're going to production.\n\n407\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.520\nIf you don't build like you\nare going to production,\n\n408\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.820\nhow can you ever hope to produce and\nmanufacturer and sell.\n\n409\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.330\n&gt;&gt; So testing forward and\nbackward is always the right thing to do.\n\n410\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.520\n&gt;&gt; Of course, of course, you do regression\ntesting, you do user acceptance testing,\n\n411\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.480\nyou do user testing, you do all\nthe different testing, you have a QA team.\n\n412\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.480\nThat QA team might be one person out of\nIndia, I don't care but you have a QA team\n\n413\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.500\nbecause if you don't quality, assure,\nand test everything you do including by\n\n414\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.220\nthe way, you're factory, your dev team,\nyour outsource pieces, all that stuff,\n\n415\n00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.470\nif you don't test everything you\nare not going to get a quality product.\n\n416\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.640\nIf you don't get a quality product,\nGuess what you don't get?\n\n417\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.650\nIt's called sales.\n\n418\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.920\nIt's a detail thing, I know.\n\n419\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.820\n&gt;&gt; And it's also called certification.\n\n420\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.020\nLet's not leave that out.\n\n421\n00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.560\nYou've got to go the FCC for\nwireless, as an example, HHS for\n\n422\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.960\nhealthcare, and FISMA, FEDRAMP, HITRUST.\n\n423\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.500\nThere's all these compliance regimes,\nthat some of them have certifying bodies,\n\n424\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.950\nsome of them don't, but\nthe point is, if your product...\n\n425\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.650\nIf you say hey, we're great for,\nlet's say HIPAA, okay?\n\n426\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.910\nSo for healthcare, all right?\n\n427\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.500\nthe Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act.\n\n428\n00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.540\nAnd if you say well, we're great for\n\n429\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.880\nHIPAA, and\ndoctors offices start using your stuff.\n\n430\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.750\nAnd then all of the sudden\nsomebody goes well, let's test.\n\n431\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:55.070\nAnd they test and your stuff is so\nnot HIPAA compliant, dear God.\n\n432\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.420\nGuess what?\nYou're in trouble.\n\n433\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.320\nYou're in serious trouble because you\ndidn't actually test your own product.\n\n434\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.130\nYou didn't check and\nyou made false claims.\n\n435\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.960\nAnd you made medical data at risk.\n\n436\n00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.410\nGuess how many lawsuits that is?\n\n437\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.580\nThe number's not low,\nlet's just put it that way.\n\n438\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was about to ask how\nmany C-level execs go to jail for\n\n439\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.390\nthis kind of stuff?\n\n440\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.945\n&gt;&gt; Not very many.\n\n441\n00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:15.430\n[LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a problem.\n\n442\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.060\nI think there should be more,\nbut whatever.\n\n443\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Correct, but the real question is,\njust like that problem of your thought,\n\n444\n00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.870\nwill it pass muster?\n\n445\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.110\nWill it pass the sniff test?\n\n446\n00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.050\n&gt;&gt; Did you plan correctly?\n\n447\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.060\nIf you said I can scale to 100,000 units,\nit's gonna cost me this much,\n\n448\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.810\nI have to do this much code review,\nI have to do this much testing, And\n\n449\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.510\nall of a sudden things start breaking\nbecause you didn't test properly.\n\n450\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.350\nBecause you didn't do\nthings the right way.\n\n451\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.530\nBecause your scaling\nplans were not correct.\n\n452\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.620\nAnd you didn't test,\ncheck, watch and iterate.\n\n453\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.690\nYou're in trouble.\n\n454\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.500\n&gt;&gt;

So one of the big things\nthat we really dig into, right,\n\n481\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.610\nis what's known as a burn rate, okay?\n\n482\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.280\nYou're talking about getting into\nsocial media and dealing with emails.\n\n483\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.590\nHow do you deal with emails\nwhen you don't have the burn?\n\n484\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:24.140\nWhen you don't have the capital to be able\nto hire somebody to deal with emails,\n\n485\n00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.810\ndeal with social media,\ndeal with phone calls, how do you do it?\n\n486\n00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually,\nthat's a really great question.\n\n487\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.530\nSo your burn rate is how fast you're\nburning money at current spend.\n\n488\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.770\nPresumably, you're not profitable yet,\nbecause, look,\n\n489\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.470\nwe just turned out a prototype,\nwe just started manufacturing it.\n\n490\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.880\nWe might be bringing in some money, but\n\n491\n00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.500\nit's certainly not enough to\nsupport the business yet.\n\n492\n00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.850\nSo your burn rate is how fast\nyou're burning the money you have,\n\n493\n00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.570\nhow long your runway is, okay?\n\n494\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.720\nMy six-month runway means,\nin six months, I'm shutting the doors.\n\n495\n00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.828\nBut if you don't have the money for\nthe capital, okay,\n\n496\n00:24:53.828 --> 00:24:56.557\nthen actually you work\nwith automated systems.\n\n497\n00:24:56.557 --> 00:24:58.655\nThere's a, is it Zendesk?\n\n498\n00:24:58.655 --> 00:25:00.680\nZendesk is a help desk system.\n\n499\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.410\nThere's all kinds of automated systems,\nOPEX, SaaS-based systems,\n\n500\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.760\nthat you can build knowledge bases,\nyou can build threaded forms with.\n\n501\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.732\nLook, if your core competency, if your\nproduct is not about a threaded form and\n\n502\n00:25:12.732 --> 00:25:15.361\na help desk system,\nwhy would you build one, okay?\n\n503\n00:25:15.361 --> 00:25:18.749\nUse something that costs you $30 a month,\n$50 a month,\n\n504\n00:25:18.749 --> 00:25:23.200\nrather than spend $10,000 of time and\neffort on building one, okay?\n\n505\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.910\nSo that's how you can support all\nthe different versions of your software.\n\n506\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.960\nThat's how you can support\nall the different pieces.\n\n507\n00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.650\nNow, mind you, supported versions\nis an important point, okay?\n\n508\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.870\nWe'll talk about that in a second, but\n\n509\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.970\nthat's how you build your FAQ,\nyour knowledge base.\n\n510\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.000\nThat's how you get your patches out, okay?\n\n511\n00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.051\nBesides the fact that everybody who has\nyour software should have an update\n\n512\n00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:42.870\nthe software here button, and\nit'll get an update out there.\n\n513\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.650\nBut that's how you get hotfixes and\nupgrades,\n\n514\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.120\nthat's how you get the information back\nto do a hotfix, okay, that kind of thing.\n\n515\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.787\nSo let's talk about all\nthe different things that we can do.\n\n516\n00:25:51.787 --> 00:25:55.955\nYou've gotta answer, who will answer\nthe phone, who will answer the email,\n\n517\n00:25:55.955 --> 00:25:59.700\nthe IRC channel, Slack,\nall these different things?\n\n518\n00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.050\nYou better think about this, and\nby the way, that's another thing.\n\n519\n00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.834\nYou better register the names for\nthose right off the bat.\n\n520\n00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:06.430\nNow, the Slack team\nmight not be a big deal.\n\n521\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.400\nBut if you don't have the Facebook for\nyour company name or your product name,\n\n522\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.540\nthe IRC channel and that kind of thing,\nyou're gonna be in trouble.\n\n523\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.570\nPeople will miss doing things.\n\n524\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.520\nI know a company that started with one\nname and built their business around\n\n525\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.670\nanother name because that's\nthe one that took off first.\n\n526\n00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.850\nThey actually had credit card chargebacks\nbecause that first name was, they're like,\n\n527\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.060\nI don't know who that is.\n\n528\n00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.510\nWell, it's the actual\nbusiness name of the company.\n\n529\n00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.690\nI didn't know that.\n\n530\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.182\nAnd they had to go through a long and\n\n531\n00:26:32.182 --> 00:26:35.631\ninvolved process to change the business\nnames and do DBAs, Doing Business As,\n\n532\n00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:38.684\nto make sure that the credit cards\ndidn't get chargebacked anymore.\n\n533\n00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:43.599\n&gt;&gt; So what is a really good free\nresource that our viewers can take away,\n\n534\n00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:48.172\nas to say, okay, well,\nI wanna make sure that it checks .com,\n\n535\n00:26:48.172 --> 00:26:51.310\n.io, Facebook, Twitter, in one shot?\n\n536\n00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.250\nIs there a place that people can go?\n\n537\n00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.784\n&gt;&gt; We don't have a screenshot of it, but\nthe one I normally use is NameCheckr.\n\n538\n00:26:55.784 --> 00:26:58.113\nNameCheckr.com, I think it is.\n\n539\n00:26:58.113 --> 00:26:59.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how's it spelled?\n\n540\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.520\n&gt;&gt; It's spelled N-A-M-E-C-H-E-C-K-R,\nleave off the last E in there.\n\n541\n00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.360\nAnd actually, you type a name,\nlike Marpet or whatever.\n\n542\n00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.456\nAnd it'll tell you if somebody's\nregistered marpet.com, marpet.io,\n\n543\n00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:17.320\nmarpet.net, .org, marpet in Facebook,\nin Twitter, in MySpace, God knows why, and\n\n544\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.557\nall the various other aspects of-\n&gt;&gt; Wow, MySpace.\n\n545\n00:27:20.557 --> 00:27:22.960\nWell, it's funny that you'd say MySpace.\n\n546\n00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.485\n&gt;&gt; Who's in your Top 8?\n\n547\n00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:24.882\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I know, right?\n\n548\n00:27:24.882 --> 00:27:27.133\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you'd\nactually say MySpace,\n\n549\n00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:29.530\nbecause when we talk\nabout versioning support.\n\n550\n00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.835\nRemember, we mentioned that, especially\nwhen you start to get into the FAQ.\n\n551\n00:27:32.835 --> 00:27:33.431\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n552\n00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:36.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, you need to go at least\ntwo to three versions back.\n\n553\n00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.090\nAnd a lot of people, from what we've seen,\n\n554\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.100\nhave made the mistake of only\ndealing with the current version.\n\n555\n00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, so this is the problem.\n\n556\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.471\nIf you have a piece of software and\nyou version it, you change things.\n\n557\n00:27:47.471 --> 00:27:50.329\nI mean, you're gonna update it, you're\ngonna hotfix it, whatever, patch it.\n\n558\n00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:53.460\nSo you've got version,\nlet's say, 1, 2, and 3, okay?\n\n559\n00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.010\nAnd current is version 3.\n\n560\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.100\nYou need to support version 3, you need\nto support version 2 and version 1.\n\n561\n00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.610\nBecause, remember,\n\n562\n00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.460\nthere's gonna be people that are locked\ninto a version because of a dependency,\n\n563\n00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.010\na regulatory regime, a rule somebody just\ndoesn't feel like patching, whatever.\n\n564\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.280\nAnd they're paying you,\nyou need to support them.\n\n565\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.750\nBecause, if you say, well, look, you're\ndoing an old version, you need to upgrade.\n\n566\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.160\nWell, we can't yet, here's why.\n\n567\n00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.600\nWell, I don't support that old version.\n\n568\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.730\nAnd they're gonna go, well,\n\n569\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.040\nwe're gonna tell everybody you're\nhorrible if you don't support it.\n\n570\n00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.900\nSo traditionally, and\n\n571\n00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.800\nthis is sort of the rule of thumb, you\nsupport the current version and 2 back.\n\n572\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.377\nAnything beyond that, you have sort\nof a legitimate way of saying,\n\n573\n00:28:29.377 --> 00:28:33.560\nhey, look, I end-of-lifed that,\nI end-of-supported that.\n\n574\n00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.243\nYou're 3 versions old,\ncome on, you've gotta update.\n\n575\n00:28:36.243 --> 00:28:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's funny that you would say that,\n\n576\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.230\nbecause if you look at what's going\non in the information security arena,\n\n577\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.450\nwe have now gotten to the point where\nthe floppy disk is ancient, right?\n\n578\n00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.523\nAnd there's not much going on with it,\nnow wait.\n\n579\n00:28:47.523 --> 00:28:49.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just hold on,\n\n580\n00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.670\njust hold on, there's a reason\nI'm going down this road, okay?\n\n581\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.490\nThe floppy disk is old, right?\n\n582\n00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.130\nWe have, what,\nFortran that's old, we have-\n\n583\n00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.470\n&gt;&gt; NASA still uses Fortran.\n\n584\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, you see what I'm saying, though.\n\n585\n00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.370\nThere are other parts that\nstill use floppy disks.\n\n586\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.302\nAnd it's security through obscurity.\n\n587\n00:29:06.302 --> 00:29:06.896\n&gt;&gt; God, can I tell the story?\n\n588\n00:29:06.896 --> 00:29:08.003\n&gt;&gt; Go for it.\n\n589\n00:29:08.003 --> 00:29:08.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, really quick.\n\n590\n00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Have at it.\n\n591\n00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:14.340\n&gt;&gt; Really quick, so I was working at a\ncompany that had been in this building for\n\n592\n00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.170\n40 years, okay?\n\n593\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.520\nAnd all of a sudden, one day,\nwe hear, beep, beep, beep.\n\n594\n00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.890\nAnd we're like, what is going on?\n\n595\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.860\nWe found it buried in a support column,\nnot a joke.\n\n596\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.396\nThere was a building support column\nthat they'd walled in, like the I-beams,\n\n597\n00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:30.961\nthey'd walled in the side of the I.\n\n598\n00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:34.524\nAnd if you opened the doors,\nwhich we didn't even know were there,\n\n599\n00:29:34.524 --> 00:29:36.230\nwe had to find them and bap them.\n\n600\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.117\nAnd they were magnet catches,\nso they pop open.\n\n601\n00:29:38.117 --> 00:29:40.840\nIt's like, there's a door there, okay.\n\n602\n00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.810\nThey opened up, and\nthere was a machine in there.\n\n603\n00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.250\nWe had no idea what this machine was,\n\n604\n00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.830\nnobody in IT had ever\nseen this thing before.\n\n605\n00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.460\nSo it's beeping, so\nwe're like, what is it?\n\n606\n00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.210\nWe pop open the panels,\nthere's a support contract, great!\n\n607\n00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.860\nWe call the company up.\n\n608\n00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.678\nWe're like,\nwe don't know what this machine is.\n\n609\n00:29:53.678 --> 00:29:54.850\nThey're like, neither do we.\n\n610\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.949\nWe're like, no, wait, we have a support\ncontract with you, we're paying you.\n\n611\n00:29:56.949 --> 00:30:00.290\nThey're like, yeah, but\nwe don't know what it does.\n\n612\n00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.088\nWe're like, well, send the expert out.\n\n613\n00:30:01.088 --> 00:30:02.241\nThey're like, what expert?\n\n614\n00:30:02.241 --> 00:30:06.331\nWe're like, well, we pay you $500 a month,\nthere's a support contract for\n\n615\n00:30:06.331 --> 00:30:07.530\nthis machine.\n\n616\n00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.248\nThey're like, yeah, the last guy that\nknew anything about that machine,\n\n617\n00:30:10.248 --> 00:30:12.461\nwe read them off the model number,\ndied about 15 years ago.\n\n618\n00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:15.192\n[LAUGH] We're like,\nokay, guys, this is bad.\n\n619\n00:30:15.192 --> 00:30:19.670\nAnd my boss, who was the head of\nIT at the time, was going, really?\n\n620\n00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.688\nWe're gonna be talking about a refund.\n\n621\n00:30:21.688 --> 00:30:24.341\nBut [LAUGH] it turns out that machine,\n\n622\n00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:29.477\nafter we tried to fix using\nthe eight-inch floppy disk that was there,\n\n623\n00:30:29.477 --> 00:30:34.560\nwas a dumb terminal for\nthe mainframe, the AS/400, okay?\n\n624\n00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.720\nWe found out that, out of the 75\npairs of Twinax wire going out,\n\n625\n00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.510\nthere was one dumb terminal left, one.\n\n626\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.390\nWe replaced her dumb terminal\nwith a computer with\n\n627\n00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.377\nHummingbird software on it and 3790-\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait,\n\n628\n00:30:49.377 --> 00:30:49.896\nwait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n629\n00:30:49.896 --> 00:30:50.614\n&gt;&gt; Terminal emulation software.\n\n630\n00:30:50.614 --> 00:30:52.136\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying you patched it?\n\n631\n00:30:52.136 --> 00:30:56.020\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no,\nno, we did a workaround.\n\n632\n00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.050\nWe did a workaround, but\nwe did a good workaround.\n\n633\n00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.960\nIt worked out really well,\nwe gave her a dumb terminal.\n\n634\n00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.730\n&gt;&gt; Which is a patch.\n\n635\n00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.740\n&gt;&gt; But we gave her a computer-\n&gt;&gt; It's a patch!\n\n636\n00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.620\n&gt;&gt; With a terminal emulation software,\nit worked out fine.\n\n637\n00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.050\n&gt;&gt; It's a patch.\n&gt;&gt; All right, it's a patch, fine.\n\n638\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.994\nBut guess what, patching is part of life.\n\n639\n00:31:07.994 --> 00:31:09.399\nLive with it, okay, plan on it.\n\n640\n00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:11.668\nIf you're gonna patch,\nif you're gonna have workarounds,\n\n641\n00:31:11.668 --> 00:31:14.770\nif you're gonna do stuff, you gotta\nhave patches, you gotta have hotfixes.\n\n642\n00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.945\nYou gotta have updates, you gotta\nsupport them to a certain extent.\n\n643\n00:31:17.945 --> 00:31:20.545\nYou've gotta make sure that you're\nusing proper version control.\n\n644\n00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.260\nYou've gotta make sure you're\ndoing things the proper way.\n\n645\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.110\nIf you don't do things the proper way,\n\n646\n00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.380\nyou're gonna incur incredible\ncosts in the long term.\n\n647\n00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.690\nWe already have ongoing costs,\nbut long-term ongoing costs?\n\n648\n00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.020\nThat's fine, but\nlong-term added incurred costs?\n\n649\n00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.050\nThat's not fine, people.\n\n650\n00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.010\n&gt;&gt; So\nare you saying that ongoing costs are fun?\n\n651\n00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, in an incredibly sarcastic way,\nyes, they are.\n\n652\n00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.162\nLook, you gotta figure out\nwho's answering the phone.\n\n653\n00:31:47.162 --> 00:31:49.210\nYou gotta figure out how you're patching,\nhow you're upgrading,\n\n654\n00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.951\nwho's your prototype tester,\nwho's your beta tester.\n\n655\n00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:54.530\nYou've gotta get feedback and\niterate, iterate, iterate.\n\n656\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.561\nEvery single piece of this is iterate,\nokay?\n\n657\n00:31:56.561 --> 00:32:01.750\nIf you're not iterating,\nyou're having a problem.\n\n658\n00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.220\nSo it's that difficult,\nyou've gotta make sure you plan ahead.\n\n659\n00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.340\nYou've gotta cost, you've gotta\nfigure out who's answering the phone.\n\n660\n00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.530\nAnd the answers to these\nquestions are very difficult.\n\n661\n00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.313\nAnd they're individualized to your\ncompany, your product, your solution for\n\n662\n00:32:14.313 --> 00:32:15.602\nyour problem, all right?\n\n663\n00:32:15.602 --> 00:32:21.562\nBut if you have any other questions-\n&gt;&gt;

Men, I love me some real good business\ndevelopment, there's nothing like it.\n\n18\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.950\nDo you know why I love\nbusiness development, Pete?\n\n19\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.660\nBecause it's fresh, it's new,\nthings are always evolving and\n\n20\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.990\nthen always changing, right?\n\n21\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.890\nAnd we're about to go though the ins and\nouts of what BD really is, right?\n\n22\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.440\nSo, with that being said we really need to\ntake a look at securities business, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.240\nSo Josh and I, we come from\nthe information security community, and\n\n24\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.888\nto us this is a really key factor, right?\n\n25\n00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:42.331\nSo, let's see here we've got 169 million\nperson records were taken in 2015.\n\n26\n00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.363\nWe can tell you that there has been\na definite rise in 2016 although we don't\n\n27\n00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:48.240\nhave the numbers right now, right?\n\n28\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.930\n&gt;&gt; We are analyzing them though, one of\nour side businesses has some interesting\n\n29\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.040\nbreach intelligence, and we've collected\nover the years several billion records,\n\n30\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.530\nI'm not supposed to tell you how\nmany billions, it's ridiculous.\n\n31\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.820\nBut [COUGH] the records that are out there\nshowed that it's getting worse every year,\n\n32\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.490\nevery quarter actually.\n\n33\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.030\nWe've done some statistical analysis and\n\n34\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.150\nwe've read up on some statistical\nanalysis done by academics.\n\n35\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.160\nEvery year it's getting worse, every year\nthe organizations, even though they claim\n\n36\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.520\nthey're doing pretty well,\nsome of them are, and some of them aren't.\n\n37\n00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.450\nAnd the new ones, again,\nit's not that there's any consistency.\n\n38\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.660\nYou can have a new organization that\ndoes a fantastic job at being secure and\n\n39\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.800\na new organization that\ndoes a horrible job.\n\n40\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.150\nAnd it's tough to tell which ones\nare going to do a good job or not.\n\n41\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.507\nSo it's a problem, it's a continual\nproblem, it's rising as a problem,\n\n42\n00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:37.990\nit's getting worse.\n\n43\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.890\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n44\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.520\n&gt;&gt; Job security.\n\n45\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Job security, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.530\nAnd more importantly,\nbusiness development.\n\n47\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.460\nBut we need to go over a couple of\nthings about business development for\n\n48\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.540\nyou to really get a good sense as\nto why we like this so much, or\n\n49\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.920\nat least I like this so much, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.810\nNear and dear true to my heart.\n\n51\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.020\nSo we're gonna do some introductions and\ndefinitions,\n\n52\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.360\nwe're gonna talk about nightmares.\n\n53\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.277\nWe're gonna go over some of the how tos\nand FAQ's, frequently asked questions of\n\n54\n00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:05.991\nbusiness development and then we're\ngonna tell you how to destroy them all.\n\n55\n00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:10.435\nSo, after going over the agenda\nwe really wanna take\n\n56\n00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:14.888\na look at products, tools,\nand services, right?\n\n57\n00:03:14.888 --> 00:03:17.974\nSo in Biz Dev we wanna know is\nthe product rubber stamped,\n\n58\n00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:22.210\nis it scalable like we've been talking\nin the last couple of segments?\n\n59\n00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.906\nIs it non human reliant\nwhich means does it really\n\n60\n00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:29.220\nneed a human interaction to keep going,\ncan it make money while you sleep?\n\n61\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.390\nAs far as tools go, tools are trained\nto the personnel to use it.\n\n62\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.540\n&gt;&gt; So effectively.\n\n63\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.230\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead.\n\n64\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.480\n&gt;&gt; A product is something that you don't\nhave to be there to make money with.\n\n65\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.530\nSomebody else is using it,\nsomebody else is paying you to use it,\n\n66\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.460\nsomebody else bought it from you,\nwhatever.\n\n67\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.620\nA tool is something that you,\nas a service provider, use, so\n\n68\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.370\nthat you can perform something for\na client.\n\n69\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.417\nSo you're not gonna leave it behind,\nyou're gonna take it with you when you go.\n\n70\n00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.731\nBut while you're there, so\nthis is something you would either sell to\n\n71\n00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.500\na service provider, or\nuse as a service provider, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.860\nAnd then obviously a service provider\nis the one that does services.\n\n73\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.610\nSo people perform the work,\nthere's hours traded for dollars.\n\n74\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.780\nYou're there consulting on compliance,\nyou use a compliance tool\n\n75\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.300\nthat you take with you, you're providing\na service and you're using a tool.\n\n76\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.520\nIf you sell them a compliance tool that is\na, let's say a GRC product, look product.\n\n77\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.620\nThe names really do mean something.\n\n78\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.010\nBut knowing how to do business development\nmeans that you have to understand what\n\n79\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.880\ntype of system your selling.\n\n80\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.450\nA product that you sell to them and\nthey keep,\n\n81\n00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.720\na tool that you sell them the use of and\ncharge them for the use of but\n\n82\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.050\nyou take with you, or\na service that you're going to perform.\n\n83\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's really funny Josh,\nthat you would speak about sales, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.720\nSo, in sales there is a lot of metrics\nthat have to be taken into account\n\n85\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.750\nto really understand what it looks\nlike for your business, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.620\nSo, what is your reach,\nwhat is your target, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.077\nIf you go back to the presentation\nwe just did, right?\n\n88\n00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:05.650\nIt will talk about how to understand what\nyour target is for your sales, right?\n\n89\n00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.080\nFrom there,\nyou take it to leads generated per month.\n\n90\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.240\nSo who are you talking to,\nwho are outreaching to, right?\n\n91\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.410\nAnd then, you go from your leads\ngenerated per month to your\n\n92\n00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.210\nleads approached versus your leads work-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n93\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.486\n&gt;&gt; Percentage,\nthen your leads work to versus your leads-\n\n94\n00:05:25.486 --> 00:05:25.997\n&gt;&gt; Closed.\n\n95\n00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:26.948\n&gt;&gt; Closed, right?\n\n96\n00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:29.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Also know as the lead conversion rate.\n\n97\n00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:33.481\nSo you're converting from people that\nyou've approached to or people or\n\n98\n00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:37.310\ncompanies that you've approached\nto actual sales, right?\n\n99\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.954\nThat from there, it tells you how much\nyour pipeline is worth, and what your\n\n100\n00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:46.984\nactual cost for customer acquisition is,\nwhich gives you your lead closed rate.\n\n101\n00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:50.390\nSo they're all symmetrical,\nthey all fit in together, right?\n\n102\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.180\nIt’s an important piece we're\ngoing to go into sales.\n\n103\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.070\n&gt;&gt; But why do I care about these numbers?\n\n104\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.543\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to go\ninto sales on the next rigs.\n\n105\n00:05:58.543 --> 00:05:59.599\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n&gt;&gt; Today,\n\n106\n00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.170\nnot rigs sorry,\non the next presentation, right?\n\n107\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Today,\n\n108\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.330\nwe're sticking with business development,\nright?\n\n109\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.887\nSo, to do that we need to understand\nthe why of Biz Dev, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:13.770\n&gt;&gt; So look, even though\n\n111\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.590\nyou may have an amazingly large network\nyou don't know everybody in the world.\n\n112\n00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.710\nYou may know Elon Musk, you may know\nBill Gates, you may know a lot of people.\n\n113\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.350\nBut there's still a limitation\nto how many people you know and\n\n114\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.280\ncan actually get at, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.260\nAnd if you don't have a good network,\nyou're not gonna succeed.\n\n116\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.220\nBuild a better mousetrap and\nthey'll show up?\n\n117\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.192\nYeah, it doesn't really work that way,\nokay?\n\n118\n00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:39.352\nYou can sit back and\ntwiddle your thumbs all you like,\n\n119\n00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:41.580\ncustomers don't just walk in the door.\n\n120\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.180\nIf they do, that's absolutely a miracle, I\nmean miracle as in it never happens, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.660\nAnd remember,\nyou may know a million people, but\n\n122\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.540\nif none of them have the problem\nyou're trying to solve,\n\n123\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.220\nnone of them are gonna care\nvery much about your solution.\n\n124\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.170\nSo you've gotta go get new customers,\n\n125\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.820\nnew people, people that you've never\nmet before, that want that solution.\n\n126\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.490\nAnd again,\nthey don't really care about you.\n\n127\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.940\nThey care about the product, the solution.\n\n128\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're right.\n\n129\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.680\nThey care about the product but they\nalso care about risk mitigation, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.350\nSo how does what your product do, right?\n\n131\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n132\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.060\n&gt;&gt; You get what I'm\nsaying here walk with me.\n\n133\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.600\nHow does your product take\ncare of risk mitigation?\n\n134\n00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.770\nI'll give you an example, I was up late\nlast night watching Shark Tank, right?\n\n135\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.460\nThey had somebody who came in with drones.\n\n136\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.080\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; And all of the sharks bought into it\n\n137\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.440\nbecause each one of them could\nsee a different use case for\n\n138\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.450\nwhat their main line of business is,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.310\nSo a drone, it actually could cut risk for\n\n140\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.842\none of the sharks because\nthey own an oil refinery.\n\n141\n00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:52.714\nSo the drone could actually fly over the\ntop of the oil refinery and look at where.\n\n142\n00:07:52.714 --> 00:07:54.484\nHumans, we're not in it.\n\n143\n00:07:54.484 --> 00:07:57.445\nWe're not in that refinery where\neverything was automated to see if there\n\n144\n00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:58.790\nwas a problem, right?\n\n145\n00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:04.820\nOr another one of the sharks just acquired\na whole bunch of land on his ranch.\n\n146\n00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now he is responsible for\n\n147\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.510\nmaintaining the trees,\nthat are on his land.\n\n148\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.810\nSo now he's using the drone who\nthey brought into to fly over and\n\n149\n00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.140\nlook directly down at the trees.\n\n150\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.450\nAnd tell which ones are dead and which\nones are alive and so on and so forth.\n\n151\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:27.560\nSo there are different levels of risk\nmitigation, depending on what's going on.\n\n152\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.480\n&gt;&gt;

Right, and a lot of it hinges\non business communication, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.030\nSo can you overcome a language barrier?\n\n319\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.130\nCan you overcome a dialect barrier?\n\n320\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.570\nAre you using the right jargon,\n\n321\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.840\nlike we've been throwing around\ntoday learning, terms of art?\n\n322\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.450\nThere you go.\n\n323\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.375\n&gt;&gt;

Six degrees of Kevin Bacon.\n\n593\n00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.210\n&gt;&gt; So, well, okay, but\nit starts with six degrees of separation.\n\n594\n00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.950\nIf you wanna get to Kevin Bacon,\nplay the Kevin Bacon game.\n\n595\n00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.980\nHe's not important to me\nin terms of business.\n\n596\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.320\nI'm sorry, Kevin, I apologize,\nyou can feel free to yell at me.\n\n597\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.860\nBut in terms of business, six degrees\nof separation, you'd be shocked\n\n598\n00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.510\nwho your friends and family know that\ncan get you access to somebody else.\n\n599\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's a really great parlay, if you will,\n\n600\n00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.650\ninto the very next topic, which is dealing\nwith sales and your contract cycle.\n\n601\n00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.080\nSo where do sales come from, do you\nreally think they come from the stork,\n\n602\n00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.870\nthey just fall out of the sky.\n\n603\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.950\nNo, they don't okay.\n\n604\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.750\nSales come from cultivation of leads.\n\n605\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:49.710\nThey come from the most unexpected places,\nfriends, family, connections.\n\n606\n00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.110\nHey, I know a guy who needs this done,\n\n607\n00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.560\nwe've had some of our most lucrative\ncontracts so far happen in that nature.\n\n608\n00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n609\n00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.410\nSo look, it matters in terms of how\nlong does a sale like would take.\n\n610\n00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.220\nIf you're selling with the government,\nthe sale cycle by the is 18 to 36 months.\n\n611\n00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.643\nIf you're selling to a company the bigger\nones the sale cycle is 6 to 12 months.\n\n612\n00:30:10.643 --> 00:30:12.860\nThe smaller ones it could\nbe little as three days.\n\n613\n00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.910\nWe've made a sale for in under two\nhours based on we've met somebody.\n\n614\n00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.710\nThey liked what we've talked about and we\nwe're even realizing they wanted to buy.\n\n615\n00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.030\nBut they realized that they\nneeded something we had.\n\n616\n00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.250\nThey said, do you sell this?\n\n617\n00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.760\nCan you do this for us?\n\n618\n00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.790\nWell yeah, what do you need?\n\n619\n00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.360\nWe need this, we'll charge you this.\n\n620\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.140\nOkay, here's a check.\n\n621\n00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.290\nMy God, this is wonderful.\n\n622\n00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.862\nSo you've gotta know how\nlong your sales cycle take.\n\n623\n00:30:34.862 --> 00:30:36.290\nYou gotta know what's\ngonna get in your way.\n\n624\n00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.029\nWhat's that called, Scott?\n\n625\n00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.444\n&gt;&gt; Friction, sales friction.\n\n626\n00:30:39.444 --> 00:30:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Lots and lots of friction.\n\n627\n00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.460\n&gt;&gt; But, you have to understand though,\nJosh and\n\n628\n00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.030\nI, we're known as super\nconnectors in our industry.\n\n629\n00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.420\nWe go to conferences to meet people,\nto understand who's doing what and where.\n\n630\n00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.970\nTo know where business is going to head.\n\n631\n00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.280\nWe can always watch talks on irongeek.com,\n\n632\n00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.570\nAdrian Crenshaw shout out,\ngood friend of ours.\n\n633\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.530\nWe can go there and\nsee anything at anytime but\n\n634\n00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.590\nwhat we don't have access\nto are the people.\n\n635\n00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.920\nThat's really where we pour\nour resources into and\n\n636\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.080\nthat gets us the business development.\n\n637\n00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and there's also people\nthat we don't wanna talk to at all if we\n\n638\n00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.500\ncan avoid and that's legal.\n\n639\n00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.180\nDon't get me wrong, I love lawyers but,\n\n640\n00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.440\nthey're the slowest thing\nin the contract cycle.\n\n641\n00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.850\nSo the faster you can get through legal\nby having pre cleared look documents that\n\n642\n00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.570\nhave been pre cleared by someone very\nprominent in the legal industry.\n\n643\n00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.516\nHave certifications on your security; have\ncertifications on your cyber insurance,\n\n644\n00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:33.520\nadd everything pre-done.\n\n645\n00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.663\nThe faster you get through legal,\n\n646\n00:31:34.663 --> 00:31:36.792\nthe faster you're gonna get\nthrough the contract sales cycle,\n\n647\n00:31:36.792 --> 00:31:38.580\nthe faster you can get that\nmagic thing called money.\n\n648\n00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.390\nI know its an amazing concept,\nbut basically,\n\n649\n00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.758\neverything that stops you is sales\nfriction, legalist sales friction.\n\n650\n00:31:45.758 --> 00:31:48.405\nThat's why we work very hard\nto get certifications done,\n\n651\n00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:51.171\nwe get all the documents pre-cleared and\nso on and so forth.\n\n652\n00:31:51.171 --> 00:31:53.917\nBecause remember,\neven after you've gotten through legal,\n\n653\n00:31:53.917 --> 00:31:57.021\nyou can still hear the worst thing\nyou can possibly hear, which is hey,\n\n654\n00:31:57.021 --> 00:32:00.870\nwe should talk about this in a couple of\nmonths when we get some more budget news.\n\n655\n00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.840\nBut all the work you've done so far,\nlet's just shelve it for six months, okay?\n\n656\n00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.590\n&gt;&gt; And to be honest,\nthat's a very viable option.\n\n657\n00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.690\nIt's known as the entrepreneur\nrollercoaster.\n\n658\n00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.290\nWhere you get money one day and\nhey, everybody eats steak,\n\n659\n00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.710\nthe next day everybody eats ramen.\n\n660\n00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.740\nThe next day everybody eats steak,\nthe next day everybody eats ramen.\n\n661\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.047\nYou go from high to low,\nto high to low, and\n\n662\n00:32:22.047 --> 00:32:24.176\ngood to bad to good to bad to good to bad.\n\n663\n00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:27.881\nAnd somewhere in there, you figure out\nwhere the pivot is to really start\n\n664\n00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:30.876\nsmoothing out the good and\nthe bad to get it nice and level.\n\n665\n00:32:30.876 --> 00:32:31.550\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n666\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think the entrepreneur's\n\n667\n00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:38.130\nrollercoaster smooths out because\nyou just start ignoring the stress.\n\n668\n00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.441\nAnd you start realizing that\nstress is part of your life.\n\n669\n00:32:40.441 --> 00:32:41.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n670\n00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.310\n&gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you.\n\n671\n00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.790\nBut it's-\n&gt;&gt; Stress and no sleep.\n\n672\n00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.270\n&gt;&gt; It's tough, it's very tough.\n\n673\n00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.280\nI mean, look, building a business is hard.\n\n674\n00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.290\nIt is one of the hardest things if\nnot the hardest things you'll ever do\n\n675\n00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.690\nbesides perhaps being a parent.\n\n676\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.918\nAnd realistically this is being a parent.\n\n677\n00:32:54.918 --> 00:32:58.750\nYou're growing and culturally\nsocializing a business to the world,\n\n678\n00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.170\nand you don't even get a tax break for\nit really, okay?\n\n679\n00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.520\nYou gotta build not only a business but\na book of business sales,\n\n680\n00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.350\ncustomers, clients,\npeople that you can call on and\n\n681\n00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.220\nthey'll give you this\nmagic thing called money.\n\n682\n00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you have to network\nlike it's your livelihood, you know?\n\n683\n00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:16.060\nWait [LAUGH] it is.\n\n684\n00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.850\nNo, seriously, your job is getting\nthe business, hence sales and biz dev,\n\n685\n00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.090\nbusiness development.\n\n686\n00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.850\nIt's not that easy, okay?\n\n687\n00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.370\nYou have to put your\nnose to the grindstone.\n\n688\n00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.660\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes it works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n689\n00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.417\nThere's a thing in information security in\nquite a lot of consulting businesses known\n\n690\n00:33:33.417 --> 00:33:34.301\nas feast or famine.\n\n691\n00:33:34.301 --> 00:33:37.897\nAnd weirdly enough, it seems your\neither looking for work desperately or\n\n692\n00:33:37.897 --> 00:33:41.190\nyou've got so\nmuch work you don't know what to do with.\n\n693\n00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.870\nSo you've either got plenty of money but\nno time or plenty of time but no money.\n\n694\n00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.300\nIt's very difficult and that's part\nof the entrepreneur's rollercoaster.\n\n695\n00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.500\nIn a consulting business,\nyou eat what you kill.\n\n696\n00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.460\nWhatever you bring in, you eat it.\n\n697\n00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.650\nIn a business, not just an occupation but\na business, you kill something,\n\n698\n00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.100\nyou bring it in and it's split\namong the people in the company.\n\n699\n00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.030\nThe idea is to get everybody so\nefficient, working so\n\n700\n00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.830\nhard, getting things done,\nthat we bring in more than we need today,\n\n701\n00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.000\nmore than we need tomorrow,\nmore than we need next week.\n\n702\n00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.980\nSo that we accrue value and\n\n703\n00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.310\nbecome either a prime acquisition target,\nor people with fat bank accounts.\n\n704\n00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.170\nWe're okay with either.\n\n705\n00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a lot of it can be akin to\n\n706\n00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.525\nstocking your freezer in Alaska for\nthe winter.\n\n707\n00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:26.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you're not gonna get a chance to\n\n708\n00:34:26.395 --> 00:34:28.265\ngo out and do as much fishing\nas you want in the winter.\n\n709\n00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:31.395\nSure, ice fishing, it's fun.\n\n710\n00:34:31.395 --> 00:34:36.995\nBears, they hibernate, so your source\nof food and meat go away, right?\n\n711\n00:34:36.995 --> 00:34:39.525\nSo you need to be able to be prepared for\na rainy day.\n\n712\n00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:45.560\n&gt;&gt; So basically, doing business\ndevelopment is very, very tough.\n\n713\n00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.380\nIt's something you've gotta network on.\n\n714\n00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.120\nIt's something you've\ngotta do a people work on.\n\n715\n00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.855\nAnd remember, a lot of technologists,\n\n716\n00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.003\nthey've been concentrating\non the technology.\n\n717\n00:34:53.003 --> 00:34:55.250\nThey haven't been concentrating\non their network.\n\n718\n00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.580\nThey haven't been concentrating on\nthe people that they need to meet to sell\n\n719\n00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.110\ntheir technology to.\n\n720\n00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.960\nSo this is something that's\nincredibly important.\n\n721\n00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.247\nYou've gotta go network,\nyou've gotta go meet people.\n\n722\n00:35:03.247 --> 00:35:05.644\nAnd if you're not good at it,\nhire somebody who is,\n\n723\n00:35:05.644 --> 00:35:08.050\npartner with somebody who is,\nget somebody who is.\n\n724\n00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.680\nGet somebody who can actually do\nthe networking for you, already owns\n\n725\n00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.210\nthe network, has the network, has the\nfriends, the family, the whatever to help\n\n726\n00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.920\nyou with funding, to help you with sales,\nto help you with getting things done.\n\n727\n00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.790\nAnd so business development is all about,\nstrangely enough, not technology.\n\n728\n00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.120\nIt's really all about people.\n\n729\n00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.350\n&gt;&gt;

am Scott Lyons, this is Josh Marpet and\nwe are with Red Lion.\n\n4\n00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.800\nToday, we are talking\nabout exit strategies.\n\n5\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.910\nSo to get us going,\nlet's do a little bit of intro first and\n\n6\n00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.010\nthen we are going to drop right into it,\nokay?\n\n7\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.027\nSo, hi I'm Scott,\nI am the CEO of Red Lion,\n\n8\n00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:27.710\nI am a graduate of the school\nof hard business knocks.\n\n9\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.340\nI've been there, I've done it,\nI've seen everything.\n\n10\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.580\nBeen inside of government,\noutside of government,\n\n11\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.040\nin the commercial space,\nall over the place.\n\n12\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.870\nI hold certifications,\nI'm not going to tell you which, and\n\n13\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.320\nI really love people and business.\n\n14\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.820\nJosh?\n\n15\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.260\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joshua Marpet,\nI'm the COO of Red Lion.\n\n16\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.520\nI've been around the block more than once.\n\n17\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.542\nIt's definitely not my first rodeo,\nor probably not even my tenth.\n\n18\n00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:55.590\nI am a member of the CEO organizations\nMindshare and Missionlink.\n\n19\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.810\nI'm a graduate of the Mach37\nschool down in Herndon, Virginia.\n\n20\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.524\nIt's the cyber security accelerator,\nI think one of the top ones in the world.\n\n21\n00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:06.147\nAnd through them, actually, is where I got\na lot of the information for this talk and\n\n22\n00:01:06.147 --> 00:01:08.870\na lot of the experience dealing\nwith venture capitalists.\n\n23\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.028\nI deal with conferences and hackers and\ntechnologists all over the country and\n\n24\n00:01:13.028 --> 00:01:14.100\nall over the world.\n\n25\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.590\nAnd through them, we've learned\nhow necessary these talks are.\n\n26\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.640\nSo let's get right into it.\n\n27\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.380\nLet's get into B4T6, exit strategies.\n\n28\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.100\n&gt;&gt; So originally,\n\n29\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.180\nthis talk we gave at a very small\nconference in Philly called PompCon.\n\n30\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.120\nShout out to the guys who were on PompCon,\ngreat conference.\n\n31\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.670\nIf you get a chance to go,\ndefinitely check it out.\n\n32\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.190\nBut if you don't,\ntry to get there, all right?\n\n33\n00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.310\nSo we're talking about how acquisitions,\n\n34\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.230\nIPOs, exiting,\nhow all of that works, right?\n\n35\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.600\nAnd to get into that we need to take\na look at a little bit of the agenda.\n\n36\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.778\nAnd so, with this we want to\nknow the statistics of exits.\n\n37\n00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:58.973\nWe want to understand and\ndetermine the worth and value.\n\n38\n00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.397\nHow exiting issues can arise.\n\n39\n00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:03.635\nWe wanna know the types of exits.\n\n40\n00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.120\nWe wanna know problems.\n\n41\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.010\nAnd most importantly, the negotiations\nand, yes, you did read that correctly.\n\n42\n00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.872\n&gt;&gt; Backwards because he insisted but\nanyway.\n\n43\n00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:18.269\n[LAUGH] Let's get into why this matters.\n\n44\n00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.520\nLook, security is a business.\n\n45\n00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.680\nInformation security is a business\nthat is growing rapidly.\n\n46\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.220\nThese statistics that we\nhave are actually now old.\n\n47\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.170\nAnd they're only about six months or\na year old.\n\n48\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370\nThe rapidity of which security is growing,\nthe number of identities that are stolen,\n\n49\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.030\nthe number of businesses\nthat are hacked into,\n\n50\n00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.480\nthe number of problems that people have.\n\n51\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.910\nAnd the compliance regimes that\nhave to be compliant with and\n\n52\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.070\nactually abide by to handle their\ncontracts, whether they are government or\n\n53\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.940\ncommercial contracts is\nincreasing incredibly rapidly.\n\n54\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.610\nIt effectively while ten years ago,\nsecurity was an occasional this and\n\n55\n00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.680\nmaybe of that, and only the forward\nthinking companies were doing pentest and\n\n56\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.080\nthings like that.\n\n57\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.160\nToday, if you're not doing a pentest at\nleast yearly, and if you're PCI based,\n\n58\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.720\ntwice yearly,\nif you're not doing continuous monitoring,\n\n59\n00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.670\nif you're not doing various things,\nyou're in trouble.\n\n60\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.750\nThese stats should show you.\n\n61\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.055\nAgain, these are I think about a year old.\n\n62\n00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:10.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.510\n&gt;&gt; The median number of days that\nattackers stay dormant is over 200.\n\n64\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.358\nThat's now over 300.\n\n65\n00:03:15.358 --> 00:03:19.203\nSo effectively, you don't get any\nknowledge of an attacker in your\n\n66\n00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:23.991\nnetwork for almost a year before you find\nout, they've been there for a while,\n\n67\n00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:28.661\nwhat did they get, we don't know,\nlet's try and figure it out, that's tough.\n\n68\n00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:32.449\nSo business is good and there's\nplenty of businesses out there, but\n\n69\n00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.450\nwhat happens when they want to sell?\n\n70\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's interesting you say that.\n\n71\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.760\nLet's take a really close\nlook at the statistics, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.357\nSo, if we can get that to go,\nthere we go, that's it exactly.\n\n73\n00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:51.430\nSo, approximately 20% of small businesses\nare on the market for sale at anyone time.\n\n74\n00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.202\nOnly about 20 to 25% will actually sell\nwithout the help of an experienced\n\n75\n00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.890\nexit advisor, right?\n\n76\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.930\nAt any given time, 40% of US businesses\nare facing a transfer of ownership issue.\n\n77\n00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:10.195\nApproximately 24% of owners said that they\nhad not planned their business exits,\n\n78\n00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:14.245\nwhereas 18 indicated that their\nexits would be opportunistic\n\n79\n00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:18.149\nwhich means that their plan was\nto wait for third party offer.\n\n80\n00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.231\n&gt;&gt; Look,\nthere's a lot of transactions that happen.\n\n81\n00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:24.010\nIn 2015, there were about 44,000 of them.\n\n82\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.800\nAnd there were $4.5 trillion.\n\n83\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.580\nIt's ridiculous how many businesses\nget bought, sold, acquired, etc.\n\n84\n00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.860\nBut if you're not ready for it, you're not\ngonna get the most out of the business,\n\n85\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.150\nout of the time that you've put in.\n\n86\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.100\nAnd as I've stated through this entire\nseries, time is the only worthy currency.\n\n87\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.330\nTime you can't get back.\n\n88\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.150\nMoney we can make, time,\nonce it's spent it's spent.\n\n89\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.570\nYou have to be prepped to maximize\nthe value of your company when a time for\n\n90\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.500\nacquisition or a liquidation event,\nan acquisition or whatever happens.\n\n91\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.502\nIf you're not ready,\n\n92\n00:04:57.502 --> 00:05:00.472\nyou'll be at the bottom into that\ncurve not at the top of it, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:00.472 --> 00:05:02.886\nBut, look,\nthese acquisitions happen all the time.\n\n94\n00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.960\nIn 2015, for\n44,000 companies to get bought or sold.\n\n95\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.760\nThat's a lot of transaction\nhappening literally everyday.\n\n96\n00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.950\nSo it's not something that happens rarely.\n\n97\n00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.180\nIt happens all the time.\n\n98\n00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.230\nLet's get you ready.\n\n99\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, you said something interesting\nabout worth and value, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.750\nAnd what we really need to look at is\nthe types of worth and value, right?\n\n101\n00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.720\nSo there are different types of\nservices that define the worth and\n\n102\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.420\nvalue of a company, right?\n\n103\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.780\n&gt;&gt; So, let's talk about that for a second.\n\n104\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.860\nIf you are a standard sort of\nshrink wrap software company,\n\n105\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.200\nyou sell $10 million worth of software\na year, and it's a product, right?\n\n106\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.970\nThat's not a service,\nthat's not a tool, it's a product.\n\n107\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.390\nI sell a package of software to $10\nmillion worth of intercompanies out there.\n\n108\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.360\nIf everybody in the company\ndisappeared tomorrow,\n\n109\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.190\nwe could still continue\nto sell the software.\n\n110\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.500\nWe'd have to support it, of course,\nbut that's not a big deal.\n\n111\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.840\nSupport is seen as low\nvalue in these cases.\n\n112\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.390\nI can then get a 10x valuation because\nI am a shrink wrap software company,\n\n113\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.810\nproduct company.\n\n114\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.260\nSo I'm selling $10 million a year,\n10x times that is 100 million.\n\n115\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.530\nI could value my company at 100 million.\n\n116\n00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.890\nAnd if I can value my company at\n100 million, that's wonderful.\n\n117\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.360\nBut what is that multiplier\nI'm talking about?\n\n118\n00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.410\nFor every type of company, it's different.\n\n119\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.580\nFor a services company, let's say,\na consulting organization,\n\n120\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.680\nthat services company is valued much less,\n\n121\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.660\neven if they're doing $20 million\nworth of consulting services a year.\n\n122\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.780\nThey're valued at only a 2 to\n5x multiplier, 5x maximum.\n\n123\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.510\nWhy?\n\n124\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.415\nBecause as soon as you sell the company,\neverybody there walks away.\n\n125\n00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:39.375\nAnd how many times have you seen a company\nsell and all the workers are gone,\n\n126\n00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.115\nlooking for greener pastures.\n\n127\n00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:44.005\nAll the worth has just\nwalked out the doors.\n\n128\n00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:45.165\nThe institutional knowledge,\n\n129\n00:06:45.165 --> 00:06:48.965\nwhich is what you sell,\nhigh value consultants, they're gone.\n\n130\n00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:53.085\nSo every single type of company has\na different valuation multiplier scheme,\n\n131\n00:06:53.085 --> 00:06:55.400\nstrata, structure,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n132\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.720\n&gt;&gt; So before we go any further,\nI definitely wanna ask you the question,\n\n133\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.790\nhow would a company understand what\nthe correct multiplier for them is?\n\n134\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nif you're a straight-up software company,\n\n135\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.070\nI sell shrink-wrap software,\nyou're gonna go on an 8 to 10x multiplier.\n\n136\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.640\nIf you're,\neffectively there are sort of standards.\n\n137\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.080\nIf you're a consulting company,\nyou're lucky if you get three.\n\n138\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.130\nOkay, five is really high, and\nthat's because you've proceduralized and\n\n139\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.450\nstandardized so much of what you've done.\n\n140\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.850\nYou could bring in a fresh crop\nof consultants and be up and\n\n141\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.180\nrunning in ten minutes.\n\n142\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.760\nNormally, you're gonna get\n1.5 to 3x multiplier for\n\n143\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.220\nyour annual running revenue,\nthat's your gross revenue, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.960\nThat's your multiplier.\n\n145\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.270\nIf you're a, there are companies\nthat break these rules.\n\n146\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.138\nSaaS companies, they're valued\nat two years of future earnings.\n\n147\n00:07:42.138 --> 00:07:46.279\nNot anymore, about two or three years ago,\nthe market, and that's a very nebulous\n\n148\n00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:50.012\nterm, so effectively we're talking\nabout the people that run the market,\n\n149\n00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.959\ntype of thing,\ndecided that two years of future earnings.\n\n150\n00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:57.147\nFirst off, I should stop and\nsay what's two years of future earnings?\n\n151\n00:07:57.147 --> 00:08:00.786\nWell if I'm a SaaS company,\nI don't sell you the software for $1,000.\n\n152\n00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:03.928\nI sell you access to the software for\n100 bucks a month.\n\n153\n00:08:03.928 --> 00:08:08.098\nWell, if I've got 100 bucks a month\nfrom you, that's $2,400 for\n\n154\n00:08:08.098 --> 00:08:10.325\nthe next two years of earnings, right?\n\n155\n00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:11.324\nFrom you, as one customer.\n\n156\n00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.527\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So if I've got 100 customers,\n\n157\n00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:18.370\nwe take that $2,400, put two 0s at the end\nof it, now I've got $240,000, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:24.347\nAdd another, maybe it's 1,000 customers,\nand now I've got 2.4 million.\n\n159\n00:08:24.347 --> 00:08:25.510\nOkay, that kind of thing.\n\n160\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.856\nI think my math works out, I hope it does,\nit did that in my head quickly.\n\n161\n00:08:27.856 --> 00:08:28.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n162\n00:08:28.692 --> 00:08:31.039\n&gt;&gt; But that's my value as a company, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:35.044\nAnd now you can do a multiplier on top of\nthat depending on which the company is,\n\n164\n00:08:35.044 --> 00:08:38.460\nhow much cache has, whether it's\na unicorn, that kind of thing.\n\n165\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.189\nBut really, that's how SaaS\ncompanies determine their value.\n\n166\n00:08:41.189 --> 00:08:42.609\nAbout three years ago,\n\n167\n00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:47.447\nthe market decided they were gonna take\nthat down to one year of future earnings.\n\n168\n00:08:47.447 --> 00:08:49.692\nAnd the one year future earnings method,\n\n169\n00:08:49.692 --> 00:08:52.721\nevery SaaS company lost half\nof their value overnight.\n\n170\n00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:56.528\nWhat a great day that, it was horrible,\nit was really a horrible day.\n\n171\n00:08:56.528 --> 00:08:59.501\nEvery SaaS company just went,\nwhat just happened?\n\n172\n00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:02.427\nIt was decided that you're gonna be\nvalued at one year future earnings now.\n\n173\n00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:05.523\nBasically one brokerage house said,\nlet's be conservative and\n\n174\n00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:07.048\nlet's make it down to one year.\n\n175\n00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:09.393\nAnd then everybody else said no,\nthat's a good idea, let's do that.\n\n176\n00:09:09.393 --> 00:09:14.325\nBecause then it becomes cheaper for us\nto buy into their next round of funding.\n\n177\n00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:17.149\nAnd I get more of\nthe company if I do that.\n\n178\n00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:20.488\nYes, so effectively, Wall Street and\nagain a nebulous term,\n\n179\n00:09:20.488 --> 00:09:22.443\nbut I'm using it properly vaguely.\n\n180\n00:09:22.443 --> 00:09:27.003\nDecided that they wanted to get more\nvalue out of any funding rounds for\n\n181\n00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:30.338\nSalesforce or Uber or\nanybody who does that stuff.\n\n182\n00:09:30.338 --> 00:09:31.093\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n183\n00:09:31.093 --> 00:09:36.162\nthe valuations come into play when we're\ndealing with the exit types, right?\n\n184\n00:09:36.162 --> 00:09:43.230\nSo as we see it, there are seven\ndifferent exit types, right?\n\n185\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:49.640\nAnd those exit types could be, you run\nforever, it's a nuisance acquisition.\n\n186\n00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.028\nThere's a little bit of acquhire,\nit an actual acquisition.\n\n187\n00:09:54.028 --> 00:10:01.028\nYou subsist and you close up shot,\nor you hit the lottery and you IPO.\n\n188\n00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:04.454\nNow let's talk about each of these for\njust a quick minute.\n\n189\n00:10:04.454 --> 00:10:08.763\nBecause it's really important to\nunderstand what you're end goal for\n\n190\n00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:09.923\nyour business is.\n\n191\n00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:13.256\nSo when you start a business,\nyou should also have an end goal for\n\n192\n00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:14.509\nthe business, right?\n\n193\n00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:17.319\nSo the first one is run forever.\n\n194\n00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:21.196\nSo nobody loves me, I guess I'll just\nmake money by running my business.\n\n195\n00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:24.742\nYou really don't make an advancement,\nyou make an impact, but\n\n196\n00:10:24.742 --> 00:10:29.289\nyou're not really advancing your business,\nyou just keep running and running.\n\n197\n00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:30.567\n&gt;&gt; No, that's not true.\n\n198\n00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:31.612\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's not true.\n\n199\n00:10:31.612 --> 00:10:33.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You can advance your business,\n\n200\n00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:35.746\nyou're just not going after venture\ncapital, nobody's looking to acquire you.\n\n201\n00:10:35.746 --> 00:10:36.292\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n202\n00:10:36.292 --> 00:10:40.555\n&gt;&gt; You can grow to a $100 million\nbusiness running your business.\n\n203\n00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:42.925\nBut this is just not doing\nit in the sort of sense of,\n\n204\n00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:45.960\nI'm going to go get sold,\nI'm going to go get bought rather.\n\n205\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.120\nSo running your business,\nyou can make as much money as you want.\n\n206\n00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.600\nNow some people run this\nas a lifestyle consultancy.\n\n207\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.694\nA lifestyle consultancy is where you build\nyourself a job rather than a business.\n\n208\n00:10:54.694 --> 00:10:59.558\nI make 150, $300,000 a year, I'm good\nthat's all I want, that's a run for ever.\n\n209\n00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:05.160\nYou can make it with 100 employees and\n10, 20, $30 million a year in sales.\n\n210\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.994\nBut nobody wants to buy you,\nyou're just gonna keep running.\n\n211\n00:11:06.994 --> 00:11:08.573\nThere's nothing wrong with\nmaking money that way.\n\n212\n00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:11.627\nWhen you talk about advancing,\nI agree with you to a certain extent.\n\n213\n00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:13.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; When you talk about advancing you're\n\n214\n00:11:13.593 --> 00:11:16.711\ntalking about advancing in adventure\ncapital, fast-growth, the sale,\n\n215\n00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:19.452\nthe massive unicorn acquisition\nstyle market that's out there.\n\n216\n00:11:19.452 --> 00:11:21.379\nYes, you're not advancing\nin that marketplace.\n\n217\n00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:26.046\nBut there's nothing wrong with running\na business for awhile, but let's move on.\n\n218\n00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:28.461\nThat's running your business\nsort of steady state.\n\n219\n00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:31.004\nHow about a nuisance acquisition,\nwhat's that?\n\n220\n00:11:31.004 --> 00:11:36.222\n&gt;&gt; It's where you may\nhave a competitor that is\n\n221\n00:11:36.222 --> 00:11:43.428\ntaking away from your sales,\nyour annual revenue, right?\n\n222\n00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:44.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:46.980\n&gt;&gt; And you say to the competitor,\nwell I just wanna get rid of you.\n\n224\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.058\nSo I'm gonna buy you up,\nI'm gonna put golden handcuffs on you.\n\n225\n00:11:50.058 --> 00:11:52.651\nAnd keep you from being able\nto do your business for\n\n226\n00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:56.374\nfive years to be able to advance mine or\nyou might just say you know what?\n\n227\n00:11:56.374 --> 00:12:00.945\nI've got the cash to buy you I like your\ntechnology, it's better than mine maybe,\n\n228\n00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:03.573\nit's happened before,\nI'm going to buy you.\n\n229\n00:12:03.573 --> 00:12:08.405\nI'm gonna enhance or embrace your\ntechnology and put you out of business.\n\n230\n00:12:08.405 --> 00:12:10.711\nBut it's okay,\nbecause I'm giving you plenty of money,\n\n231\n00:12:10.711 --> 00:12:12.086\nyou're now coming to work for me.\n\n232\n00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:14.091\nWe are going to merge\nthe technologies together and\n\n233\n00:12:14.091 --> 00:12:15.823\neverything is gonna be fine and\nhunky dory.\n\n234\n00:12:15.823 --> 00:12:18.677\nBut getting them out of your market space,\nthat's the important part.\n\n235\n00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:20.862\n&gt;&gt; Well isn't that more of\na aquihire more than anything else?\n\n236\n00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:23.363\nI mean you really don't care about\nthe product in an aquihire, but\n\n237\n00:12:23.363 --> 00:12:24.400\nyou care about the people.\n\n238\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.426\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, no, no,\n\n239\n00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:29.024\nbecause a nuisance acquisition is when\nsomething is in your sort of space.\n\n240\n00:12:29.024 --> 00:12:32.714\nThey do the exact same widgets as I do\nwith a couple of different twists, and\n\n241\n00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:34.073\nI want them out of my space.\n\n242\n00:12:34.073 --> 00:12:37.063\nThey're taking sales away from me,\nthey're annoying me and\n\n243\n00:12:37.063 --> 00:12:40.295\nthey're diluting the market and\nthey're diluting the message.\n\n244\n00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:43.313\nI'm gonna destroy them by buying\nthem up and taking them in.\n\n245\n00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:45.171\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat would be a good example of that?\n\n246\n00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:46.331\n&gt;&gt; Of a nuisance acquisition?\n\n247\n00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.318\n&gt;&gt; In a real world example of businesses\nas they stand today in the past,\n\n248\n00:12:50.318 --> 00:12:53.843\nwhat have we seen that would be\na really good example of that?\n\n249\n00:12:53.843 --> 00:12:58.269\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean Microsoft bought\nPerceptive Pixel quite a few years ago,\n\n250\n00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:01.900\nand took their technology and\ntook them out of the market.\n\n251\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.573\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what is Perceptive Pixel?\n\n252\n00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:07.033\n&gt;&gt; The Surface touch tables\nthat everybody was doing?\n\n253\n00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:07.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n254\n00:13:07.768 --> 00:13:10.980\ntouch screens,\nthat was huge touch screens.\n\n255\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.059\nThere's only four perceptive\npixel screens left, I understand.\n\n256\n00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.240\nOne of them Dead Mouse actually owns,\nit's in his house.\n\n257\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.925\nHe uses it to control his sound system.\n\n258\n00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:18.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great fan.\n\n259\n00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:20.466\n&gt;&gt; Amazing musician.\n\n260\n00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; LinusTechTips did a great segment on\n\n261\n00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:24.274\nall the cool technology in his house.\n\n262\n00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:25.969\nI was drooling, it was horrible.\n\n263\n00:13:25.969 --> 00:13:31.079\nBut the Perceptive Pixel got bought\nturned into the Surface touch screens.\n\n264\n00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:34.728\nAnd so that's extinguishing\nthe technology effectively and\n\n265\n00:13:34.728 --> 00:13:36.701\npulled all their technology in.\n\n266\n00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:40.756\nI don't even think the Surface touch\nscreens exist any more other than\n\n267\n00:13:40.756 --> 00:13:43.376\nthe tablets,\nI dont think the tables exits.\n\n268\n00:13:43.376 --> 00:13:44.724\nI'm not sure that they still build them.\n\n269\n00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:45.857\nThey might, I might be wrong.\n\n270\n00:13:45.857 --> 00:13:48.364\nBut that would be an example\nof a nuisance acquisition.\n\n271\n00:13:48.364 --> 00:13:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then the next example\nto drop right back into this,\n\n272\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.019\nis the acquisition itself, right?\n\n273\n00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:58.476\nSo some borger like organization\ncomes in and buys me, okay?\n\n274\n00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:00.474\n&gt;&gt; So if Raytheon says-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n275\n00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:03.376\n&gt;&gt; I like your technology, we don't\nhave anything like that right now.\n\n276\n00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:06.801\nRemember, it's not a nuisance acquisition,\nyou're not a small company.\n\n277\n00:14:06.801 --> 00:14:07.980\nAnd another small company or\n\n278\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.135\nbigger company says you're competing\nin our space and muddying the space.\n\n279\n00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:13.654\nI'm buying you and getting you out\nof business, that's a nuisance.\n\n280\n00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:15.295\nRaytheon or Lockheed Martin or\n\n281\n00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:19.050\nsome other big company comes in\nI'm just using these examples.\n\n282\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.871\nSays, we love your technology, your a\nmature company, your ripe for acquisition.\n\n283\n00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:26.930\nWe wanna buy your technology and take you\nand make you a Raytheon technology or\n\n284\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.555\nLockheed Martin or Microsoft technology or\nGoogle or whatever, and\n\n285\n00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:32.880\nwe're just gonna buy your company.\n\n286\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.646\nAnd here's money, and\nhere's golden handcuffs.\n\n287\n00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:37.767\nYou're gonna work for us to ease\nthe transition through and then after two,\n\n288\n00:14:37.767 --> 00:14:41.640\nthree, four, five years, you can stay if\nyou want, you can leave, it's up to you.\n\n289\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.262\nNormally they'll tie the bulk\nof the money to those years.\n\n290\n00:14:44.262 --> 00:14:47.694\nSo you get some money right now,\nyou get some money year one, two, three,\n\n291\n00:14:47.694 --> 00:14:48.686\nfour whatever it is.\n\n292\n00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:51.498\nThat's a standard sort of acquisition,\nokay?\n\n293\n00:14:51.498 --> 00:14:53.135\nThey own your company from there on out.\n\n294\n00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:57.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you don't hit any of\nthe ones that we've just lined out,\n\n295\n00:14:57.385 --> 00:14:59.775\nyou can always go into subsist, okay?\n\n296\n00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:00.472\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n297\n00:15:00.472 --> 00:15:02.121\n&gt;&gt; You just move along.\n\n298\n00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:04.709\n&gt;&gt; No, no, subsist is different,\nyou're talking about run forever.\n\n299\n00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:08.286\nRun forever is I'm profitable but\nnobody wants to buy me.\n\n300\n00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:08.947\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:13.282\n&gt;&gt; Subsist over there on the right is I\nhaven't been able to get my technology to\n\n302\n00:15:13.282 --> 00:15:14.311\nwork correctly.\n\n303\n00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:18.175\nI know it's gonna work, I know it's\ngonna work, but it doesn't work right or\n\n304\n00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:22.470\nnobody wants to buy it, but I believe\nin it, I'm obsessed and believe in it.\n\n305\n00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.380\nBut you've run out of run way, you've ran\nout of money, you've ran out of backers,\n\n306\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.830\neven your family won't\nreturn your calls anymore.\n\n307\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.943\nYou can subsist,\nyou can drive cars for Uber, and\n\n308\n00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.402\nkeep building cold in your spare time.\n\n309\n00:15:33.402 --> 00:15:37.176\nAnd just get to the point where\nyou can build it [CROSSTALK]\n\n310\n00:15:37.176 --> 00:15:38.639\n&gt;&gt; Or lay roofing tiles and\n\n311\n00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:43.350\nwhatever it keep writing your code and\nhoping that your company takes off.\n\n312\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.509\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it works, but honestly, most\nof the time subsist goes to close up shop.\n\n313\n00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:50.355\nYou realize after a certain\namount of time, this idea is bad,\n\n314\n00:15:50.355 --> 00:15:51.460\nthis idea won't sell.\n\n315\n00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.162\nSomebody else is building it, it's not\nme and they've got backing and for\n\n316\n00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:58.690\nwhatever reason, even if your ideas,\nSpecifically and wonderful and\n\n317\n00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.450\nsuperior to the other idea, the other\ncompany, nobody wanted to back you,\n\n318\n00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.540\nit happens, don't take it personally.\n\n319\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.530\nIt's just a matter or luck or time or\n\n320\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.425\nchance or being there,\nas we've said earlier, and I think.\n\n321\n00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you close up shop.\n\n322\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.110\nYou close the doors and go, I'm done,\nand I've actually had to do that.\n\n323\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.857\nI started a company at Mach 37,\nthat I shut down after a year and a half.\n\n324\n00:16:19.857 --> 00:16:22.440\nBecause while we were\ndoing amazing things, and\n\n325\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.094\nwe actually had investment in our hands,\nand customers in our hand,\n\n326\n00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:30.650\nthe customers that we were gonna get\nweren't gonna pay for about 90 days.\n\n327\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.430\nThe investors, well,\nwe only had about enough money for\n\n328\n00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.210\n45 days even with their investment.\n\n329\n00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.325\nAnd so when the numbers didn't match up,\nit was time to close up shop.\n\n330\n00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:42.410\n&gt;&gt; And I know we're on camera and\nwe're talking about this,\n\n331\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.330\nbut just to ask you a real question here.\n\n332\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.190\nOkay Josh,\nhow difficult was that decision to make?\n\n333\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.281\n&gt;&gt; That was not easy.\n\n334\n00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:53.300\nThat was not easy at all.\n\n335\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.340\nWe take an investment, we had the people\nwho had worked on this project and\n\n336\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.720\nthis code for a year and\na half, and they put their life,\n\n337\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.090\ntheir hearts, their souls into it.\n\n338\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.231\nI had people move to various parts of the\ncountry to be closer to data centers and\n\n339\n00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:08.680\nto work together.\n\n340\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.330\nWe had-\n&gt;&gt; You had a lot going on,\n\n341\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.450\nyou had a lot going on.\n\n342\n00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was very tough,\nbut it was the right choice.\n\n343\n00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:22.261\nI wasn't gonna string them along any\nfarther, I wasn't gonna make them wait for\n\n344\n00:17:22.261 --> 00:17:24.898\nmoney that maybe could\nshow up 45 days later.\n\n345\n00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:26.320\nI wasn't gonna make them and beg them and\n\n346\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.740\nplead them to make them even farther\ninto the hole than they already were.\n\n347\n00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.130\nI wasn't gonna do that to them,\nso we've closed the doors.\n\n348\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.620\nAnd it was a hard decision,\nbut it was the right decision.\n\n349\n00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.460\nI made a good decision and\nI'm actually very proud of it.\n\n350\n00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.720\nSomebody that came to me and\n\n351\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.000\nsaid [INAUDIBLE] capitalist said,\nI'm actually really proud of you.\n\n352\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.390\nI said, why, he said,\n\n353\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.980\nbecause that decision is the hardest\ndecision you can possibly make.\n\n354\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.290\nBut it is a good decision to make,\nit's almost invariably the right one,\n\n355\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.140\nbecause if you make that decision it means\nthat you're strong enough to make it, and\n\n356\n00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.520\nit says good things about you and\nyour character.\n\n357\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.660\nIt was pretty cool.\n\n358\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Now on the opposite spectrum,\nand thank you for sharing that.\n\n359\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.190\nOn the opposite side of\nthe spectrum from that is the IPO.\n\n360\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthe IPO is the initial public offering,\n\n361\n00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.950\nwhen you can take a company and\nmake it go public.\n\n362\n00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.807\nAnd it's really cool, it is a lottery.\n\n363\n00:18:15.807 --> 00:18:19.244\nIt's winning the lottery, because normally\nthat means you're about to make millions,\n\n364\n00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:22.420\nand billions, and gazillions of dollar\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily\n\n365\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, so\n\n366\n00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.090\nthere are companies that have gone IPO and\ntheir IPO was supposed to be $20 and\n\n367\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.910\nit's dropped immediately\nbefore it even opens to ten.\n\n368\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.895\n&gt;&gt; Well, who recently tried to go IPO,\n\n369\n00:18:33.895 --> 00:18:39.680\ninflated their price and\nthen it bottomed out, SnapChat.\n\n370\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.080\n&gt;&gt; Aah, right, right, right SnapChat,.\n\n371\n00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.990\nI forget the pricing on SnapChat, but they\nthought that their price was gonna be so\n\n372\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:51.030\nhigh because they were worth, they were\ntold you're worth billions of dollars.\n\n373\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.650\nI think a billion, billion and\na half, I forget what it was.\n\n374\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.140\nAnd they went, well, we're gonna\nprice our stock price at that level.\n\n375\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:58.980\nAnd everybody went, well,\n\n376\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.430\nyou don't actually make any money, how\nare we gonna make any money off of you?\n\n377\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.240\nBecause when you're in the venture capital\ngrind, doing the A rounds, the B rounds,\n\n378\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.230\nC rounds, and so on, your valuation\nis continuing increasing, okay?\n\n379\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.090\nDoing a down run is bad, so you're\ncontinuing increasing your valuation, but\n\n380\n00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.725\nthat sort of self referential,\n\n381\n00:19:16.725 --> 00:19:21.410\nself-help guru people, when you go to\nan IPO, now you're talking accountants.\n\n382\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.480\nAnd they're going,\n\n383\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.170\nyou're actually not worth anything\nbecause you don't make any money.\n\n384\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.340\nSo, your price is going down right now.\n\n385\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.760\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that it comes\ndown to long term sustainment\n\n386\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.340\nversus the initial hey,\nwe're cool, we do cool stuff?\n\n387\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nBut\n\n388\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.270\nwe skipped over one of our pieces here,\none of our seven types.\n\n389\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.840\nSo let's go back for one second,\nand that's Acqui Hire.\n\n390\n00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.545\nWe skipped over Acqui Hire so\nlet's do that.\n\n391\n00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:49.230\nAcqui-Hire is an interesting one.\n\n392\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.780\nIf somebody goes look, you're a one\nperson company, a three person company,\n\n393\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.650\na five person company,\nwe want to grab that\n\n394\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.390\nincredible technology and\nthat incredible ability that you have.\n\n395\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.040\nWe wanted you to stop that company and\nshut it down, we will pay you for\n\n396\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.560\nthat company.\n\n397\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.920\nWe're gonna hire you, and we're gonna\neither pay you for the technology or\n\n398\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.570\nmaybe it's a true acqui-hire.\n\n399\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.680\nWe don't even care about your technology,\nwe just want you because what you\n\n400\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.660\nbuilt there is amazing, and we want you,\nyour team, your group, whatever.\n\n401\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.360\nThey're gonna hire your entire group and\nthey're gonna pay premium prices.\n\n402\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.920\nThey'll throw some cash at you to have\nyou stop your company and shut it down.\n\n403\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.460\nAnd they now have acquired an entire group\nthat you so carefully and thoughtfully\n\n404\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.550\ncollected for them of data scientists,\ndevelopers, of dev ops team, whatever.\n\n405\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.230\nAnd they love it, because they are able\nto pick up an entire team of people at\n\n406\n00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.000\neffectively less time, with good fit,\nthe whole nine yards for\n\n407\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.960\nless than it would have\ncost them with a recruiter.\n\n408\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we just went over\nthe seven types of exits, okay?\n\n409\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:54.450\nNow, let's go over a little bit of\nthe issues of how exits actually work.\n\n410\n00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.102\nSo when you're looking at exits,\nyou're looking at a third and\n\n411\n00:20:57.102 --> 00:20:57.946\na third and a third.\n\n412\n00:20:57.946 --> 00:21:04.460\nSo 33%, roughly subsists,\n33%, they just utterly fail.\n\n413\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.770\nAnd then 33%, the last third,\nget to the series A, right?\n\n414\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.670\nWhich actually counts as a success.\n\n415\n00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou've gotta put a caveat on that, okay?\n\n416\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.900\nSo the caveat is that's for\nan accelerator, an incubator,\n\n417\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.486\nsort of an organization that's devoted\nto moving startups forward over time.\n\n418\n00:21:22.486 --> 00:21:23.826\nAnd this is anecdotal evidence.\n\n419\n00:21:23.826 --> 00:21:25.686\nI don't have a study behind it, but\n\n420\n00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:28.235\nthis has been what we\nlooked at with statistics.\n\n421\n00:21:28.235 --> 00:21:33.224\nSays that out of at least 107, that's\nkind of the minimum critical mass pool\n\n422\n00:21:33.224 --> 00:21:35.690\nthat you need to have good statistics.\n\n423\n00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.734\nOut of 107, about a third subsist,\nwhich is going back to subsist,\n\n424\n00:21:38.734 --> 00:21:42.156\nsaying I don't have any money, I don't\nhave any people, but I'm gonna code.\n\n425\n00:21:42.156 --> 00:21:44.954\nI'm gonna drive for\nUber and code on the side.\n\n426\n00:21:44.954 --> 00:21:48.170\nSo realistically, they're not doing very\nmuch and they don't count very well.\n\n427\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:48.860\nA third fail,\n\n428\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.280\nlike I failed with my company, and\na third of them get to a Series A.\n\n429\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.910\nNow Series A does not mean that\nthey've gone to a liquidation event.\n\n430\n00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.170\nIt is not technically an exit strategy.\n\n431\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.296\nSo every time you go to an incubator and\nthey go, hey,\n\n432\n00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:00.920\n80% of our companies succeed.\n\n433\n00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.840\nWell great, define success, please.\n\n434\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.190\nBecause to them, success could be just\ngetting out of the accelerator and\n\n435\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.270\nhaving customers.\n\n436\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.980\nIt could be, in our case,\nwe're talking about Series A as a success.\n\n437\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.840\nBut that's just your first round\nof institutional VC funding.\n\n438\n00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.650\nSo is success liquidation event, because\nthe number is much lower than that.\n\n439\n00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Woah, woah, woah, woah.\n\n440\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.160\nTime out.\nSo\n\n441\n00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.070\nyou're saying that the Series A is\nthe first round of VC funding?\n\n442\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.330\nWhat about Angel?\n\n443\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.240\n&gt;&gt; That's not VC funding.\n\n444\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.070\nSorry, that's not\ninstitutional VC funding.\n\n445\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's more like it.\n\n446\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.900\n&gt;&gt; So look.\n\n447\n00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.520\nA successful exit however\nwhich is not a Series A,\n\n448\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.800\nit's a successful exit\ncan be almost anything.\n\n449\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.230\nIf you sell even at a loss,\nyou have successfully exited.\n\n450\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.560\nYou have performed a liquidation event.\n\n451\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.930\nSo even if you do a down round then you\nare, not necessarily a down round, but\n\n452\n00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.400\nif you sell your company at a loss,\nyou put $10 million in and\n\n453\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.350\nyou get an $8 million buyout.\n\n454\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.790\nAt least you got something that\nyou can give to your people.\n\n455\n00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.180\nYou got something that you can distribute.\n\n456\n00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.820\nYou can pay back,\nhopefully most are all your investors.\n\n457\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:08.690\nYou might walk away with a $100,000 or a\nmillion dollars whatever or maybe nothing.\n\n458\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.420\nBut you successfully exceeded.\n\n459\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.660\nNow, what that does that mean?\n\n460\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.925\nLet's talk about that in just a second.\n\n461\n00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:17.590\nEarlier in this series of talk,\nwe talked about the team.\n\n462\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:23.730\nNow if you are a successfully exited\nentrepreneur, you are successful.\n\n463\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.000\nAnd your next venture,\n\n464\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.910\nyou will have so much easier time\ngetting venture capital funding.\n\n465\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:34.290\nSo even if you sell at a loss, it will\nlead to success in your future ventures.\n\n466\n00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:34.960\nWhy?\n\n467\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.630\nBecause you have cache, you have clout.\n\n468\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.151\nYou have the VC on your side,\nyou are now a hot commodity for\n\n469\n00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:45.670\nthe next team, a venture that comes along.\n\n470\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.031\nYou go, I wanna be a part of that,\nyou're really a hot commodity,\n\n471\n00:23:49.031 --> 00:23:50.290\na team member for them.\n\n472\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.609\nYou're a winner.\n\n473\n00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:55.035\n&gt;&gt; But remember,\nwe also talked about key markers for\n\n474\n00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:58.310\nsuccess in business in\nanother one of our talks.\n\n475\n00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.310\nRight, we talked about them in,\nwas it B for T one?\n\n476\n00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:03.270\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n477\n00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.466\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think so.\nMake sure you watch all of the Business\n\n478\n00:24:05.466 --> 00:24:07.010\nfor Technologists talks.\n\n479\n00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.170\nAnd totally shameless plug, forgive me.\n\n480\n00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.257\nBut make sure you watch all\nof them here on BizPro.TV.\n\n481\n00:24:11.257 --> 00:24:15.048\nWe think they're pretty good talks,\nwe've worked on these for a long time, and\n\n482\n00:24:15.048 --> 00:24:16.390\na lot of effort.\n\n483\n00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.218\nBut look, as we've said earlier, a cruddy\nidea with a great team is better for\n\n484\n00:24:20.218 --> 00:24:22.960\nan investor than a great idea\nwith a cruddy team, okay?\n\n485\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.780\nThe team is more important\nthan the technology.\n\n486\n00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.540\nThe technology is worth 5%, that's\nstraight from a venture capitalist's lips.\n\n487\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.443\nIt was B for T one,\ncuz that's technology is worth 5%.\n\n488\n00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.326\nAnd a team with a successfully exited\nentrepreneur is 30% more likely to succeed\n\n489\n00:24:39.326 --> 00:24:41.013\nthan one without one, okay?\n\n490\n00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:41.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n491\n00:24:41.636 --> 00:24:46.310\nnow you're starting to get into exit\nproblems versus actual exit issues.\n\n492\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.110\nAnd so to understand the problems, right,\n\n493\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.950\nwe need to look at liquidation\npreferences, we need to look at ratchets.\n\n494\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.070\nWe need to look at how\nthe investors look at us, and\n\n495\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.730\nwhat the founder expectations are.\n\n496\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.595\nHow many people have we had come up\nto us and say, I wanna be this guy,\n\n497\n00:25:04.595 --> 00:25:08.650\nas this CEO, I wanna be this person,\nI wanna make millions of dollars.\n\n498\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.570\nAnd we're like,\nno it doesn't work like that.\n\n499\n00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm gonna tell a story,\nI won't name names.\n\n500\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.070\nBut I had somebody come up to me and say,\nI wanna be a CEO like you and like him.\n\n501\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.270\nAnd the him that they were pointing to\nwas the CEO of a massively successful\n\n502\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.130\ninformation security company.\n\n503\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.200\nAnd I said great, you wanna be like him,\ncuz you don't wanna be like me.\n\n504\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.331\nWhat do you mean?\n\n505\n00:25:30.331 --> 00:25:34.225\nWell, I mean I'm a CEO, at the time I was,\nand I've got 15 people or\n\n506\n00:25:34.225 --> 00:25:36.520\nso people working for me.\n\n507\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.121\nBut I pay myself last, and\noftentimes that means I don't get paid.\n\n508\n00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:43.524\nHe was like yeah, I wanna be like him, he\nmakes money, he makes millions of dollars.\n\n509\n00:25:43.524 --> 00:25:44.811\nI'm like, absolutely,\n\n510\n00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:48.810\nfirst thing you need to do is go be\nthe CISO of a million dollar corporation.\n\n511\n00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.780\nPlan for\nyears about when you're gonna leave,\n\n512\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.290\nget the contract signed before you ever\nleave the safety of that paycheck.\n\n513\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.910\nHave the people sign up to start on day X,\nand have work for them on day X.\n\n514\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.230\nAnd then the day that you leave,\nday X happens a day or two later, and\n\n515\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.230\nguess what, you're already making money.\n\n516\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.590\nBut to do that, you need to have\na little bit of time in grade first.\n\n517\n00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.240\nBut I thought all CEOs\nmade millions of dollars.\n\n518\n00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.850\nThe answer is no, that's not the way\nit works, let's discuss why.\n\n519\n00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.380\nSo when you go and get venture capital,\ninstitutional capital,\n\n520\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.570\nthere's gonna be clauses in there that\nare gonna go, well is that important?\n\n521\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:27.710\nAnd they're gonna go, it's no big deal,\nthey're lying, it's a huge big deal.\n\n522\n00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.780\nThere are some good VCs out\nthere that will tell you,\n\n523\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.160\nthis is what we do, this is why we do it,\nand this is how it works.\n\n524\n00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.420\nThank them, even if you don't wanna\nwork with them, thank them for\n\n525\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.870\nbeing open and honest, I love VCs\nlike that, they're wonderful people.\n\n526\n00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.855\nBut things like liquidation preference,\nif a VC has a liquidation preference,\n\n527\n00:26:43.855 --> 00:26:48.490\nthey get every dollar, sorry,\nthey get the dollars before you do, okay?\n\n528\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:53.620\nThey get a dollar for every share plus\nthe cost of the shares before it comes\n\n529\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.416\ndown to you as the founding team,\nthe CEO, the CTO, the C whatever,\n\n530\n00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:02.430\nthe founding plank owners for\nthe entire company, etc.\n\n531\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:08.630\nLet's assume that they get\na million shares, and they get a 1X\n\n532\n00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.010\nliquidation preference, they get the price\nof the shares plus a million dollars.\n\n533\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.250\nWait, a million dollars?\n\n534\n00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.710\nYeah, because a million shares is\na pretty common amount of shares.\n\n535\n00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.170\nWe normally started companies at\nMach 37 with 10 million shares.\n\n536\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.579\nSo if you're gonna give\naway 30% of the company,\n\n537\n00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:27.090\nwell that's 3.3 million shares\nright there, that kind of thing.\n\n538\n00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.160\nI'm bastardizing the numbers,\nDan, don't kill me.\n\n539\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.065\nBut, Dan Woolley, a good friend and\ntaught me a lot of this at Mach 37.\n\n540\n00:27:35.065 --> 00:27:38.780\nIrrespectively, so you've got\nthe liquidation preferences that can get\n\n541\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.090\nthe venture capitalists the money.\n\n542\n00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.870\nAnd by the time you get\ndown to the founders,\n\n543\n00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.275\nyou might have zero dollars left.\n\n544\n00:27:44.275 --> 00:27:48.920\nSo okay, hm, that's a problem isn't it?\n\n545\n00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.130\nI mean,\nI wanna make money as a founder, so\n\n546\n00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:52.550\nlet's take out the liquidation preference.\n\n547\n00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.560\nOkay great, how about ratchets?\n\n548\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.292\nA ratchet is an anti-dilution thing.\n\n549\n00:27:56.292 --> 00:28:02.310\nIf the founder, sorry, if the VC buys\n30% of the company, and then we go for\n\n550\n00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.580\nanother round of funding, and the VC\nsays I'm not putting any more money in,\n\n551\n00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.250\nbut I've got a ratchet in,\nyou're not allowed to dilute.\n\n552\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.448\nI keep 30% of the company,\neven if you add more shares, so\n\n553\n00:28:11.448 --> 00:28:14.851\nyou've gotta give me shares, and\nI don't have to put money in.\n\n554\n00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:17.530\nIt's like wait, what?\n\n555\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.840\nSo at the end of the day,\nif you have 30% and they have 30% and\n\n556\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.840\nanother VC has 30%, and\nonly one of them has a ratchet.\n\n557\n00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.590\nLet's say you add another VC,\nwell now you're gonna give them 30% but\n\n558\n00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.910\nyou're gonna add those shares.\n\n559\n00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.750\nSo everybody comes down a little bit\nin the original pool, to say 20%.\n\n560\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.970\nNo, no, no, not the VC with the ratchet,\ncuz one guy with 30,\n\n561\n00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.760\none lady with 30, one guy with 20, and\nyou've got, wait, this is a problem.\n\n562\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.764\nI keep going down, they keep going up,\nbecause they're not getting diluted,\n\n563\n00:28:47.764 --> 00:28:48.974\nwhat's going on here?\n\n564\n00:28:48.974 --> 00:28:50.900\nBut remember-\n&gt;&gt; We lose control.\n\n565\n00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and remember,\nas investors you are first in line right?\n\n566\n00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.020\nBut as the founder?\n\n567\n00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.940\nNo, no, no, no, you are last in line.\n\n568\n00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.170\nIn fact, we gave this talk at PumpCon,\ndo you wanna tell the story real quick?\n\n569\n00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.420\n&gt;&gt; So\nthere was a young lady in the audience,\n\n570\n00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.572\nit was a lovely young lady,\nincredibly smart.\n\n571\n00:29:08.572 --> 00:29:13.500\nI believe a NASA scientist, absolutely\nbrilliant, a wonderful conversationalist.\n\n572\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.950\nWe gave this talk and explained that\nfounders can get totally screwed.\n\n573\n00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.420\nThey can get absolutely no money\nat all at the end of the day.\n\n574\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.460\nAnd there's still a successfully exited\nentrepreneur, and that's great, and\n\n575\n00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.240\nthat again gives them better chance for\nsuccess in the next one.\n\n576\n00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:32.000\nBut they might walk away with 5 grand,\n50 grand, 0, nothing at all.\n\n577\n00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.438\nAnd she was just blown away,\nno that's not the way it works.\n\n578\n00:29:36.438 --> 00:29:38.140\nPlease, explain to us how it works.\n\n579\n00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.890\nShe goes, but\nyou make millions of dollars.\n\n580\n00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.103\nNo, you can, you absolutely can, and\n\n581\n00:29:42.103 --> 00:29:45.812\nit's absolutely possible that\nyou'll walk away with nothing.\n\n582\n00:29:45.812 --> 00:29:49.652\nIt was really a problem because she\ndidn't get that as a technologist,\n\n583\n00:29:49.652 --> 00:29:54.470\nshe had this naive notion, unfortunately,\nthat founders make all the money.\n\n584\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.910\nWe often use the metaphor of an ice\ncream cake for the money that comes in.\n\n585\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.550\nThe founders and the plank owners,\nthe original employees are the first layer\n\n586\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.077\nthat gets put into the ice cream cake,\nokay?\n\n587\n00:30:03.077 --> 00:30:06.822\nAnd then you go and freeze it, and\nthen you add some more ice cream for\n\n588\n00:30:06.822 --> 00:30:07.760\nthe next layer.\n\n589\n00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.310\nLike chocolate at the bottom,\nthen vanilla, then strawberry,\n\n590\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.530\nevery layer of funding that comes\nin is the next layer in the cake.\n\n591\n00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.670\nWell, when you go to cut the cake,\nguess what, the top layer comes out first.\n\n592\n00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.700\nThey get the money first,\nthen the next layer, then the next layer.\n\n593\n00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.330\nLook, all the way at the bottom,\nit's the founders.\n\n594\n00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.800\nWe don't have any money left,\nI'm so sorry.\n\n595\n00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.230\nYou don't get anything,\nhave a nice day, you're last in line.\n\n596\n00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.910\nLook, there's two kinds of CEOs and\nfounders in the world.\n\n597\n00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.730\nThey're the ones that want control,\nand the one's that want success.\n\n598\n00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.400\nIf you're a founder or CEO that says,\nI want control, what's gonna happen?\n\n599\n00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.970\n&gt;&gt; You're pretty much gonna\nrun it right into the ground.\n\n600\n00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:46.590\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n\n601\n00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.530\n&gt;&gt; Always, every single time,\nbecause you're\n\n602\n00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.580\nnot able to see the forest through the\ntrees and take a look at the big picture,\n\n603\n00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.190\nunderstand what other people are trying\nto tell you, and get those points across.\n\n604\n00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.140\nVersus the founder-owner who says,\n\n605\n00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.040\nokay, I'm gonna let somebody who knows\nwhat they are doing run with this.\n\n606\n00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.420\n&gt;&gt; If you want success,\nthere's a good chance you'll succeed.\n\n607\n00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.640\nIf you want control,\nthere's a good chance you'll have control.\n\n608\n00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.150\nNotice I didn't say you'll succeed.\n\n609\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\ndon't forget to hire to success, right?\n\n610\n00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.060\nDon't just say well my friend can do\nthis so, I'm gonna hire him for it.\n\n611\n00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.810\nReally look for the people and\ntake your time, because the investment,\n\n612\n00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.420\nin the long run, will be worth it.\n\n613\n00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.140\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe wanted to give you some references,\n\n614\n00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.490\nthere's some incredible\ninformation out there.\n\n615\n00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.250\nAnd so we've got a slide\nthat has references on it.\n\n616\n00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.880\nVenture Deals by Brad Feld,\nplease buy the book.\n\n617\n00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.050\nI think he's coming out with a new\nedition soon, I'm not sure about that.\n\n618\n00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.845\nThis will let you know more\nthan your lawyer, your VC, or\n\n619\n00:31:41.845 --> 00:31:44.463\nat least as much as your VC,\nabout how venture deals,\n\n620\n00:31:44.463 --> 00:31:47.743\nliquidation events, ratchets,\nall that kind of stuff happens.\n\n621\n00:31:47.743 --> 00:31:50.450\nIt's a fantastic book,\nI can't recommend it enough.\n\n622\n00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.231\nI constantly read a chapter on my\nKindle here or there, everywhere.\n\n623\n00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:55.640\nThere's a great blog called,\nBoth Sides of the Table.\n\n624\n00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.296\nThere's Investopedia for terms.\n\n625\n00:31:57.296 --> 00:31:59.436\nThere's all sorts of terms out there.\n\n626\n00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:02.885\nRemember, again, throughout this entire\nseries we've talked about terms of art.\n\n627\n00:32:02.885 --> 00:32:07.123\nIf you don't know the jargon,\nyou will get screwed.\n\n628\n00:32:07.123 --> 00:32:10.130\nSo that's a term of art, but\nnot for this profession.\n\n629\n00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we screenshot this.\n\n630\n00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:14.786\nScreenshot this exact slide, 100%.\n\n631\n00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:21.009\nGo out and look for where these things\nare, and hey, if you find something that\n\n632\n00:32:21.009 --> 00:32:24.968\nyou think should be included, for later-\n&gt;&gt; Let us know.\n\n633\n00:32:24.968 --> 00:32:28.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let us know, and hey,\nwhere can people reach us at?\n\n634\n00:32:28.068 --> 00:32:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Well they can get to us.\n\n635\n00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.660\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n636\n00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.481\n&gt;&gt; At our email addresses and twitters.\n\n637\n00:32:33.481 --> 00:32:37.056\nI'm Josh Marpet, @quadling,\nat jmarpet@redlion.io.\n\n638\n00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:41.201\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Scott Lyons, Casper, @csp3r.\n\n639\n00:32:41.201 --> 00:32:47.506\nYep [LAUGH], and\nyou can reach me at slyons@redlion.io.\n\n640\n00:32:47.506 --> 00:32:52.230\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for joining us here at\nthis business for technologists talk.\n\n641\n00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:56.050\nThe last one in the original series B4T6,\nExit Strategies.\n\n642\n00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.340\nWe've talked about what happens\nwhen companies get acquired,\n\n643\n00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.270\nor Jacqui-hired, or\nall the different variations above.\n\n644\n00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.290\nWe've talked about problems\nthat can happen and\n\n645\n00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.870\nissues you've got to watch out for.\n\n646\n00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.118\nWe've talked about reality\nversus expectations, and\n\n647\n00:33:08.118 --> 00:33:10.507\nwe've blown a lot of people's\nminds with these concepts,\n\n648\n00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:12.492\nand it's honestly one of\nthe first talks we did.\n\n649\n00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:15.230\nIt was fascinating to see how\nmany people's minds got blown and\n\n650\n00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.884\nrebooted because of these concepts,\n\n651\n00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:19.481\nand that's actually why we did\nthis whole series of talks.\n\n652\n00:33:19.481 --> 00:33:23.528\n&gt;&gt; And that's because a lot of what\nwe're saying, in this talk specifically,\n\n653\n00:33:23.528 --> 00:33:26.130\nis not in the forefront\nof most people's minds.\n\n654\n00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.743\nWhat's in the forefront is hiring for\n\n655\n00:33:28.743 --> 00:33:33.398\nsuccess, is building the products,\nis getting the right things,\n\n656\n00:33:33.398 --> 00:33:38.396\npeople, team, everything else that\nwe've talked about out the door.\n\n657\n00:33:38.396 --> 00:33:41.843\nAnd more often than not,\nwhen it comes to exiting the company,\n\n658\n00:33:41.843 --> 00:33:44.717\nit's the exact last thing\nthat people think about.\n\n659\n00:33:44.717 --> 00:33:50.139\nWhen realistically, it should be I'm\nstarting a company, here's where\n\n660\n00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:55.916\nI want to take it, and then everything\nelse in between is the rest of the 95%.\n\n661\n00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:59.662\n&gt;&gt; One of the venture capitalists that\nwe're friends with told us, if you don't\n\n662\n00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:03.311\nhave an exit strategy from day one,\nit's not gonna work, and he's right.\n\n663\n00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:05.563\nSo we want you to watch this.\n\n664\n00:34:05.563 --> 00:34:08.768\nWe want you to understand and learn,\nand figure out, it might change.\n\n665\n00:34:08.768 --> 00:34:09.708\nThat's fine.\n\n666\n00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:13.743\nBut figure out what your exit strategy is,\nor your preferred exit strategy is, so\n\n667\n00:34:13.743 --> 00:34:16.140\nthat you can aim for\nit as you go along the route.\n\n668\n00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.770\n&gt;&gt; So Josh, speaking of exit strategies.\n\n669\n00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.270\n&gt;&gt; I think that's my cue.\n\n670\n00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:25.925\nSo thank you for watching us here at\nBizPro.TV for B4T6, Exit Strategies.\n\n671\n00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:27.400\nTake care.\n\n672\n00:34:27.400 -->
