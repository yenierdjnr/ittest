introduce you\nto the ICND1 content, right, for\n\n4\n00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.847\ngetting ready for Exam 100-105.\n\n5\n00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:22.669\nAnd to help us to make sure that we\nactually know what we're gonna be covering\n\n6\n00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.780\nin this new show that we're\nproducing is Mr Todd Lammle.\n\n7\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.882\nThank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:30.330\n>> Thank you, Ronnie,\nit's good to be back here with ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.370\nI am very excited about this\nepisode we're about to create.\n\n10\n00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.623\nWe're about to do multiple episodes,\nboth for the ICND1 CCENT and\n\n11\n00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:42.420\nthen of course for the CCNA ICND2\nsection 2, different courses.\n\n12\n00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.878\nSo in this first course,\nwhich we're about to jump into,\n\n13\n00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.351\nwe're gonna learn about inner\nnetworking and Ethernet.\n\n14\n00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.635\nAnd we're gonna spend some\ntime on Ethernet actually.\n\n15\n00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.361\nWe'll really get our foundations down pat,\nTCP/IP, and\n\n16\n00:00:55.361 --> 00:01:00.700\nthen we're gonna hit subnetting,\nVLSM, and summarization.\n\n17\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.760\nAll right, so maybe you feel really\ncomfortable with inner networking,\n\n18\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.950\nEthernet, TCP/IP, subnet, and VLSM and\nsummarization, and that's fine.\n\n19\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.440\nBut I highly recommend maybe\nperusing through it and\n\n20\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.420\nredoing and building up that foundation.\n\n21\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.100\nIt's kind of like going to the gym, right?\n\n22\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.350\nGotta go do some push ups, right,\nget our subnetting down at least, right?\n\n23\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.060\nNo subnetting, no CCENT, right?\n\n24\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.110\nNo VLSM, no summarization, no CCENT, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.919\nThen we're gonna hit the CISCO IOS,\nwe're gonna log into some routers and\n\n26\n00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:34.803\nswitches, just basic stuff,\ndoing the help send, setting IP addresses,\n\n27\n00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.320\nunderstanding CDP, and\nmanaging the CISCO IOS.\n\n28\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.790\nSo we actually spent a lot of\ntime in managing CISCO IOS.\n\n29\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.141\nSo in this newer CCENT, based from 2016,\nfrom the one that was from 2013, right?\n\n30\n00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:49.004\nWe got a new one in 2016.\n\n31\n00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.660\nWe have a lot more management\nof the CISCO IOS, right?\n\n32\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.690\nSo although in the CISCO IOS chapter six,\n\n33\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.370\nwe're going to set our passwords,\ncrypt our passwords, and things like that.\n\n34\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.437\nAnd we're going to then manage\nthe network with like Telnet SSH.\n\n35\n00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:07.063\nAnd one of their bigger objectives\nthis time is DHP servers, right, and\n\n36\n00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:11.780\nunderstanding DHCP servers, configuring\nDHCP servers, controlling DHCP servers.\n\n37\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.150\nSo we're gonna spend some time,\nand in my book,\n\n38\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.150\nI talk about DHCP servers in three\ndifferent chapters, three different ways,\n\n39\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.180\nthat's how important this is,\nDNS servers, understanding DNS servers.\n\n40\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.430\nAnd then we're going to hit IP routing.\n\n41\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.960\nThis is a routing and switching course, so\n\n42\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.623\nwe're gonna spend some\ntime with IP routing.\n\n43\n00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.730\nThe CCENT doesn't have a huge\namount of objectives on routing.\n\n44\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.170\nWe have to understand how packets and\nframes work, and\n\n45\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.210\nthe frames work locally to get\na packet to a router, for example, and\n\n46\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.040\nthe packets switch to another network and\nput into another frame.\n\n47\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.210\nWe have to understand that process, and\n\n48\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.970\nwe'll go through it in detail in\nthe IP routing section, right?\n\n49\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.950\nAnd then we also cover static and\ndefault routing,\n\n50\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.930\nthat's pretty much most of the routing\nobjectives, configuration objectives.\n\n51\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.260\nBut we also then get into RIP version 2.\n\n52\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.690\nSo unlike the old CCENT 2013 objectives,\nin the new objectives that had come out in\n\n53\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.720\n2016, they just had RIP version\n2 static and default routing.\n\n54\n00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.270\nSo we will make sure that we\nunderstand that, passive interfaces.\n\n55\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.906\nWe'll go into a little bit more detail\nthan we have in the past in CCENT\n\n56\n00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:09.680\nversion 2.\n\n57\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.330\nBut then we're gonna get into switching,\nlayer two switching.\n\n58\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.270\nAnd understanding how switches work,\nhow they forward filter and\n\n59\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.090\nflood frames, and then we're gonna do\nVLANs and access ports, trunk ports,\n\n60\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.360\ninter VLAN routing with router on a stick,\nand with a layer three switch, right?\n\n61\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.020\nSo, layer switch is probably the best way\nto go today, but we have to know both for\n\n62\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.270\nthe objectives.\n\n63\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.594\nOkay, then we're gonna hit security,\nwe're gonna talk about access list, and\n\n64\n00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.450\nwe only hit, [LAUGH] in the new CCENT,\nwe only talk about standard access list.\n\n65\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.140\nSo, they're pretty simple, actually,\nbut securing VTY lines, right?\n\n66\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.400\nWe're gonna make sure we do a lab on that,\nand then we're gonna get into NAT, and\n\n67\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.170\nwe're gonna do configuration on\nstatic dynamic NAT with the pool and\n\n68\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.660\nthen PAT or NAT overload.\n\n69\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.558\nSo we're gonna really hit NAT hard,\nand then we're gonna finish up with\n\n70\n00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:07.433\na really big section,\na very exciting section on IPv6.\n\n71\n00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:09.210\nSo repeat after me.\n\n72\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.860\nIPv6 is my friend.\n\n73\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.630\nAll right, so stick around.\n\n74\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.210\nDon't leave until the end cuz\nwe have a big finale, all right?\n\n75\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:22.505\nSo, let's get started on CCENT, and we're\ngonna jump right into inter networking.\n\n76\n00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:31.189\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Unlike IPv4, there are many different types of addresses: link local addresses, unique-local, unique global addresses.  The address space is a 128 bit in size.  It’s function though is analogous to that of IPv4 addresses but it does it differently, easier and better because of it’s design.  IPv6 addresses are either stateless or stateful.  Stateless addresses are auto configured and stateful addresses will be assigned through DHCPv.6.  In stateful addressing the advertisement is from the dhcp server using imcp 134 on ff02::1,   if stateless then the advertisement is from the client on ff02::2 on ICMP 133",
