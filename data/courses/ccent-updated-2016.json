introduce you\nto the ICND1 content, right, for\n\n4\n00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.847\ngetting ready for Exam 100-105.\n\n5\n00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:22.669\nAnd to help us to make sure that we\nactually know what we're gonna be covering\n\n6\n00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.780\nin this new show that we're\nproducing is Mr Todd Lammle.\n\n7\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.882\nThank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:30.330\n>> Thank you, Ronnie,\nit's good to be back here with ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.370\nI am very excited about this\nepisode we're about to create.\n\n10\n00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.623\nWe're about to do multiple episodes,\nboth for the ICND1 CCENT and\n\n11\n00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:42.420\nthen of course for the CCNA ICND2\nsection 2, different courses.\n\n12\n00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.878\nSo in this first course,\nwhich we're about to jump into,\n\n13\n00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.351\nwe're gonna learn about inner\nnetworking and Ethernet.\n\n14\n00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.635\nAnd we're gonna spend some\ntime on Ethernet actually.\n\n15\n00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.361\nWe'll really get our foundations down pat,\nTCP/IP, and\n\n16\n00:00:55.361 --> 00:01:00.700\nthen we're gonna hit subnetting,\nVLSM, and summarization.\n\n17\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.760\nAll right, so maybe you feel really\ncomfortable with inner networking,\n\n18\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.950\nEthernet, TCP/IP, subnet, and VLSM and\nsummarization, and that's fine.\n\n19\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.440\nBut I highly recommend maybe\nperusing through it and\n\n20\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.420\nredoing and building up that foundation.\n\n21\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.100\nIt's kind of like going to the gym, right?\n\n22\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.350\nGotta go do some push ups, right,\nget our subnetting down at least, right?\n\n23\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.060\nNo subnetting, no CCENT, right?\n\n24\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.110\nNo VLSM, no summarization, no CCENT, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.919\nThen we're gonna hit the CISCO IOS,\nwe're gonna log into some routers and\n\n26\n00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:34.803\nswitches, just basic stuff,\ndoing the help send, setting IP addresses,\n\n27\n00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.320\nunderstanding CDP, and\nmanaging the CISCO IOS.\n\n28\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.790\nSo we actually spent a lot of\ntime in managing CISCO IOS.\n\n29\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.141\nSo in this newer CCENT, based from 2016,\nfrom the one that was from 2013, right?\n\n30\n00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:49.004\nWe got a new one in 2016.\n\n31\n00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.660\nWe have a lot more management\nof the CISCO IOS, right?\n\n32\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.690\nSo although in the CISCO IOS chapter six,\n\n33\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.370\nwe're going to set our passwords,\ncrypt our passwords, and things like that.\n\n34\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.437\nAnd we're going to then manage\nthe network with like Telnet SSH.\n\n35\n00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:07.063\nAnd one of their bigger objectives\nthis time is DHP servers, right, and\n\n36\n00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:11.780\nunderstanding DHCP servers, configuring\nDHCP servers, controlling DHCP servers.\n\n37\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.150\nSo we're gonna spend some time,\nand in my book,\n\n38\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.150\nI talk about DHCP servers in three\ndifferent chapters, three different ways,\n\n39\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.180\nthat's how important this is,\nDNS servers, understanding DNS servers.\n\n40\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.430\nAnd then we're going to hit IP routing.\n\n41\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.960\nThis is a routing and switching course, so\n\n42\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.623\nwe're gonna spend some\ntime with IP routing.\n\n43\n00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.730\nThe CCENT doesn't have a huge\namount of objectives on routing.\n\n44\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.170\nWe have to understand how packets and\nframes work, and\n\n45\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.210\nthe frames work locally to get\na packet to a router, for example, and\n\n46\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.040\nthe packets switch to another network and\nput into another frame.\n\n47\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.210\nWe have to understand that process, and\n\n48\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.970\nwe'll go through it in detail in\nthe IP routing section, right?\n\n49\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.950\nAnd then we also cover static and\ndefault routing,\n\n50\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.930\nthat's pretty much most of the routing\nobjectives, configuration objectives.\n\n51\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.260\nBut we also then get into RIP version 2.\n\n52\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.690\nSo unlike the old CCENT 2013 objectives,\nin the new objectives that had come out in\n\n53\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.720\n2016, they just had RIP version\n2 static and default routing.\n\n54\n00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.270\nSo we will make sure that we\nunderstand that, passive interfaces.\n\n55\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.906\nWe'll go into a little bit more detail\nthan we have in the past in CCENT\n\n56\n00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:09.680\nversion 2.\n\n57\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.330\nBut then we're gonna get into switching,\nlayer two switching.\n\n58\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.270\nAnd understanding how switches work,\nhow they forward filter and\n\n59\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.090\nflood frames, and then we're gonna do\nVLANs and access ports, trunk ports,\n\n60\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.360\ninter VLAN routing with router on a stick,\nand with a layer three switch, right?\n\n61\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.020\nSo, layer switch is probably the best way\nto go today, but we have to know both for\n\n62\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.270\nthe objectives.\n\n63\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.594\nOkay, then we're gonna hit security,\nwe're gonna talk about access list, and\n\n64\n00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.450\nwe only hit, [LAUGH] in the new CCENT,\nwe only talk about standard access list.\n\n65\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.140\nSo, they're pretty simple, actually,\nbut securing VTY lines, right?\n\n66\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.400\nWe're gonna make sure we do a lab on that,\nand then we're gonna get into NAT, and\n\n67\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.170\nwe're gonna do configuration on\nstatic dynamic NAT with the pool and\n\n68\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.660\nthen PAT or NAT overload.\n\n69\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.558\nSo we're gonna really hit NAT hard,\nand then we're gonna finish up with\n\n70\n00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:07.433\na really big section,\na very exciting section on IPv6.\n\n71\n00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:09.210\nSo repeat after me.\n\n72\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.860\nIPv6 is my friend.\n\n73\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.630\nAll right, so stick around.\n\n74\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.210\nDon't leave until the end cuz\nwe have a big finale, all right?\n\n75\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:22.505\nSo, let's get started on CCENT, and we're\ngonna jump right into inter networking.\n\n76\n00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:31.189\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.593\nI'm your host Ronnie Wang.\n\n4\n00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:17.288\nAnd today,\n\n5\n00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:21.980\nwe're gonna be taking the Interconnecting\nCisco Networking Devices part

studios.\n\n10\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.508\n>> Thank you, very much.\n\n11\n00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:36.342\nIt's great to be here, guys.\n\n12\n00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:41.020\nI'm gonna jump right into our first\nepisode, internetworking, define exciting\n\n13\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.800\nterms like collision domains, broadcast\ndomains and even the term internetwork.\n\n14\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n15\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.555\nAll right, on this one here,\nwe have the basic network and if you guys\n\n16\n00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:54.543\nare following with my book, I use the same\nfigures throughout this video course that\n\n17\n00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:58.100\nI will in my book, so you should be\nable to follow along chapter by chapter.\n\n18\n00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.270\nNow, that being said, Bob's gonna talk\nto Sally, I use that analogy a lot.\n\n19\n00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.475\nSally doesn't really like Bob,\n\n20\n00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:05.973\nas you'll find out as we go through\nthese episodes but nonetheless,\n\n21\n00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:08.788\nBob wants to communicate with Sally,\nmaybe get a file from her or something.\n\n22\n00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:13.772\nSo he'll use a file transfer protocol,\nmaybe we'll use FTP and\n\n23\n00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.430\nhe'll say hey, FTP Sally, you there?\n\n24\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.490\nAnd really his host doesn't\neven communicate to Sally,\n\n25\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.730\nit has to do something first.\n\n26\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.654\nWhat is that Ronnie, you think?\n\n27\n00:01:22.654 --> 00:01:25.210\n>> We normally have to do\nsomething called name resolution.\n\n28\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.075\n>> Name resolution's like ding,\nding, ding.\n\n29\n00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.690\nSo, we have to and\nDNS is pretty important.\n\n30\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.380\nNow in the world where we're running\nmostly IP Version 4 today as users,\n\n31\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.850\nin our back ISPs we're using more IPV6.\n\n32\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.240\nSaying something like TellMed or FTP\n1.1.1.1 which is Sally's IP isn't a big\n\n33\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.110\ndeal, but being DNS becomes a much bigger\ndeal when we get tied to version 6.\n\n34\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.690\nBut also if we didn't have DNS,\nwe wouldn't be able to get to places on\n\n35\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.110\nthe Internet too, because we'd have to\nknow every IP address on the Internet,\n\n36\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.830\nthat could be a little cumbersome.\n\n37\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.150\nNone the less, DNS is gonna resolve\nSally's address to an IP address in this\n\n38\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.198\nexample something simple right, 1.1.1.1.\n\n39\n00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:07.820\nNow, Bob has almost everything he\nneeds to use to communicate to Sally.\n\n40\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.450\nHe still needs to get her-\n>> MAC address.\n\n41\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.085\n>> MAC address.\n\n42\n00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:12.370\nThank you, very much.\n\n43\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.260\nIf we are on a LAN,\nI don't communicate using IP address.\n\n44\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.830\nI use that IP address to\nget someone's MAC address,\n\n45\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.690\nhardware address, burned-in address,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n46\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.942\nNonetheless, Sally's going to send that,\nor he's gonna look in his ARP cache.\n\n47\n00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:27.744\nBut when you get sent in a host, he's\ngonna save that for I think Windows keeps\n\n48\n00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:31.740\nit for about nine minutes, but Cisco\nrouters keep it for four hours, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.672\nSo basically, now we're going to broadcast\nan ARP address resolution protocol,\n\n50\n00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:41.838\nget Sally's Mac at us,\nnow Bob can communicate to Sally.\n\n51\n00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:46.388\nBut on this basic network, we just created\nconnecting segments together here, so\n\n52\n00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:49.768\nthey can share resources like files,\nprinters and whatnot,\n\n53\n00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:52.820\nthat's why we created the basic network.\n\n54\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.280\nSo, in the basic network we have hubs,\nand all they read is digital signal,\n\n55\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.060\nwork at something called layer one and\nall we do is read the digital signals.\n\n56\n00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.620\nNow, inside here we encode the ones and\nzeroes, right.\n\n57\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.010\nSo in ethernet, we use something called\nManchester encoding, but we also use\n\n58\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.450\nsomething called analog signalling today,\ntoo and I'll show you that in a minute.\n\n59\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.580\nBut in this case here when\nBob sends a digital signal,\n\n60\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.990\nthe hubs don't segment the network.\n\n61\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.330\nThey just take that digital signal and\nre-amplify and send it out or\n\n62\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.400\nregenerate it and\nsend it out every port, right?\n\n63\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.780\nSo, this is considered\none big collision domain.\n\n64\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.978\nMeaning that every device is\nreally just in one big network,\n\n65\n00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:35.793\ncuz these wires are all just\ninterconnected together with this device.\n\n66\n00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:39.253\nSo, this is one big collision domain,\nmeaning that only one device can\n\n67\n00:03:39.253 --> 00:03:42.942\ncommunicate at a time, and I think all\nof us are aware that what happens if two\n\n68\n00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:45.720\ndevice and\na digital signal at the same time.\n\n69\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.800\nNow so, we're not going to really use hub\ntoday, we're going to use LAN switches.\n\n70\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.450\nRight, they came from bridges,\nthey break up collision domain.\n\n71\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.411\nSo, every port on the switch is\ncalled his own collision domain.\n\n72\n00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:04.220\nSo now this allows us to have\nmore bandwidth for users.\n\n73\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.790\nSo in this case here,\nwhen Bob wants to talk to Johnny,\n\n74\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.450\ncertainly broadcast,\ngetting his MAC address.\n\n75\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.780\nOnce he does that, he sends a frame\nwith a destination MAC address to John.\n\n76\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.310\nIt comes over here to the switch,\nthe switch doesn't have any destination\n\n77\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.630\nport with that MAC address on it, or\nany board with that MAC address on it.\n\n78\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.600\nSo, it doesn't forward it out any ports.\n\n79\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.636\nSo, Sally is very happy right now,\ncuz she's not getting John's data anymore.\n\n80\n00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:34.258\nNow in this case here, John wants to go to\nthe Internet and he sends it to a switch.\n\n81\n00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:37.060\nAnd instead of like the hub where it\njust takes that digital signal and\n\n82\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.360\nsends out every port,\nnow we're only gonna send it out to port,\n\n83\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.160\nthe frame that's destined for,\nin this case here it's destined for what?\n\n84\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.600\nThe default gateway,\n\n85\n00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.920\nwhich is configured on John's host via\nstatically with an IP address or through,\n\n86\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.520\nwith probably typically through something\ncalled DHCP which we will look at shortly.\n\n87\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.654\nBut it comes in here the source MAC\naddresses look to make sure it's in\n\n88\n00:04:57.654 --> 00:05:00.518\nthe MAC address so\nwe know John's MAC address.\n\n89\n00:05:00.518 --> 00:05:04.324\nThe destination if we don't know it, we're\ngoing to flood this frame now to every\n\n90\n00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.325\nport that is looking for the destination.\n\n91\n00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:09.510\nBut in this case we know it, so\nit really goes to port four.\n\n92\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.848\nAgain, the Cisco's term for micro\nsegmentation where every port beings its\n\n93\n00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:16.070\nown collision domain really shows\nits value here, doesn't it?\n\n94\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.560\nBecause we're not sending frames out,\nports where the data's not destined.\n\n95\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.890\nWe're saving bandwidth for users this way.\n\n96\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.956\nHowever, but without routers,\n\n97\n00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:28.834\nwe might have multiple collision domains\nhere guys, but we're one big what?\n\n98\n00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:29.682\n>> Broadcast domain.\n\n99\n00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:31.517\n>> Broadcast domain.\n\n100\n00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:34.260\nBy default, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.570\nSo, Bob's sitting here going,\nI love it that everyone hears my data,\n\n102\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.700\nbut you're gonna learn that\nBob's kind of a jerk in my book.\n\n103\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.520\nWhen I was at Hughes in the 90s,\nhe was an accountant, and he was a jerk.\n\n104\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.970\nS, I've been using him in my books for\n18 years, this poor Bob guy.\n\n105\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.246\nAnyways, never piss off someone in IT.\n\n106\n00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:52.889\nAll right, anyways, I love shouting.\n\n107\n00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.840\nAnd he sends it out, and\nbasically you hear Sally go man,\n\n108\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.760\nI need to get away from this guy, right?\n\n109\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.930\nSo you can read more detail about Bob and\nSally in my book.\n\n110\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.880\nThat's should go and\nmake you go out and buy my book.\n\n111\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.100\nThe drama in networking that\nyou never knew existed.\n\n112\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.690\nRemember, that Cisco calls\nthis micro segmentation.\n\n113\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.650\nSo in this case here, one big broadcast,\nis our network better?\n\n114\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.980\nAbsolutely, better than the hub network,\nbut not good enough for today's network.\n\n115\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.320\nNow we're gonna create a what?\n\n116\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.640\nWhat's this section called?\n\n117\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.600\nAn internetwork.\n\n118\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.668\nSo, when we put out a router or some type\nof, hold on guys, layer three device,\n\n119\n00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:35.610\nright, so we can have an enterprise\nswitch that does this as well.\n\n120\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.355\nNow, we're breaking up a broadcast domain.\n\n121\n00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:42.140\nSo when I look at this figure here,\nI have two broadcast domains.\n\n122\n00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.720\nOne for each router interface and\nI have multiple collision domains.\n\n123\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.640\nThis is one, two,\nthree collision domains on each side,\n\n124\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.910\none broadcast domain on each side, two\nbroadcast domains total in this figure,\n\n125\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.910\nand there's,\nlooks like six collision domains.\n\n126\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.580\nThat being said, Bob sends a broadcast,\nthe router drops the broadcast,\n\n127\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.850\ndoes not forward it by default.\n\n128\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.170\nCan I forward that?\n\n129\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.692\nCan I fix it to sort for its broadcast?\n\n130\n00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.599\nYeah, we'll do that later on,\nbut in this case here,\n\n131\n00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.790\nwe're gonna have collision domains,\nnow we have broadcast domains.\n\n132\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.175\nThis is where the term\ninternetworking comes in.\n\n133\n00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:19.351\nOnce we put a layer three device in,\nnow we have separate broadcast,\n\n134\n00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:24.608\nmeans these are called subnets aren't\nthey, we're in IP version four, right.\n\n135\n00:07:24.608 --> 00:07:26.820\nAnd Cicsco likes the term address base,\nand\n\n136\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.750\nthe reason why is because I'm gonna\nhave an IPv4 network over here.\n\n137\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.294\nBut I can certainly even have\nan IPv6 network over here.\n\n138\n00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:35.706\nThey don't use subnets,\nthey're just called links.\n\n139\n00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:40.296\nThat's why you're gonna love IPv6,\ncuz once we get to our subnetting section,\n\n140\n00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:42.840\nyou're gonna go, take me to IPv6.\n\n141\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.852\nAnyways, in this case here we have\na separate address base on each side, but\n\n142\n00:07:46.852 --> 00:07:50.108\nwe just wanna think about\na broadcast domain equals a subnet,\n\n143\n00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:52.695\ncuz we're just doing an IP\nversion 4 right now.\n\n144\n00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:57.155\nNow, couple of other things here,\nsome networking devices,\n\n145\n00:07:57.155 --> 00:08:01.150\nit needs to have to do with\nyour CCENT objectives.\n\n146\n00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.530\nThat's to get people paying\nattention here, right?\n\n147\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.026\nSo some new CCENT objectives, collision\ndomains, broadcast domains, switches,\n\n148\n00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:09.257\nrouters, nothing really new\nunder the sun there, but\n\n149\n00:08:09.257 --> 00:08:11.265\nlet's pay attention to\ncouple of devices here.\n\n150\n00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:15.418\nFirst off, let me change my color here\nto get to some, let's do green and\n\n151\n00:08:15.418 --> 00:08:17.576\nwe've got our firewall here.\n\n152\n00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:20.760\nAnd I think I remember coming back here\na few months ago, and I think we have some\n\n153\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.080\nepisodes, I did a whole section\non something called Firepower.\n\n154\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.480\nThat was Cisco's next generation IPS,\nnext generation firewall.\n\n155\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.010\nWe need firewall technologies today.\n\n156\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.300\nReally, I mean I can't even imagine why\nwe'd have to say something like this.\n\n157\n00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.277\nIt's pretty obvious,\nright, ransomware and all.\n\n158\n00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:45.044\nSo there are plenty of different subjects\nto go further into firewalls other than\n\n159\n00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:48.983\nthis course, but we absolutely\nhave to have firewalls, plural.\n\n160\n00:08:48.983 --> 00:08:51.774\nThe other thing that I wanna bring\nto your attention here, over here,\n\n161\n00:08:51.774 --> 00:08:52.980\nthis access point.\n\n162\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.560\nRemember these hosts here?\n\n163\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.860\nThey're communicating digitally\non our ethernet network but\n\n164\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.830\nwhen I come over here,\nI'm certainly doing digital, but\n\n165\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.810\nnow I'm gonna communicate from\nthis AP to this wireless host.\n\n166\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.680\nHow do I do that with\na wireless digital signal?\n\n167\n00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.880\nWhat do you think?\n\n168\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.860\n>> It's gonna be an analog signal.\n\n169\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.415\n>> Analog signal which makes this a what?\n\n170\n00:09:11.415 --> 00:09:16.261\nA something that, let's go back into\nthe 90s I think, a modem, modulator demod,\n\n171\n00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:18.347\nso I'm gonna go digital to analog and\n\n172\n00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:21.610\nthen analog back to digital\nto communicate, right?\n\n173\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.900\nNow, the most important\nthink on is not that.\n\n174\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.750\nThe most important thing is over here.\n\n175\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.262\nThis is being controlled now by a device\non your internetwork called a controller.\n\n176\n00:09:30.262 --> 00:09:34.530\nNow, I use these in my large internetwork,\nso I work with my customers, 10, 20, 30,\n\n177\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.650\n40, 50,000 users and more, right?\n\n178\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.483\nControllers manage a wireless network,\nmake them secure, and they're really,\n\n179\n00:09:40.483 --> 00:09:41.149\nreally good.\n\n180\n00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:42.857\nNow, these are considered lightweight,\n\n181\n00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:45.561\nI used to use the word dumb until\nCisco said, don't use that term and\n\n182\n00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:48.230\nI'm like well, they are kinda dumb,\nbut they're lightweight.\n\n183\n00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.560\nThey don't have any code,\n\n184\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.750\nthe configurations downloaded when\nthey boot up from the controller.\n\n185\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.080\nWe configure them from the controller and\nso on, and if you have a smaller network,\n\n186\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.200\nI say, you don't have to have these\nexpensive enterprise controllers.\n\n187\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.520\nProbably the best one I've seen is,\nwhat is that, Meraki, right?\n\n188\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.775\nThat's a really good cloud-based one,\nvery inexpensive and easy to manage, but\n\n189\n00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.190\nit's still the same idea.\n\n190\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.016\nWe have a central management for\nour wireless networks.\n\n191\n00:10:14.016 --> 00:10:18.066\nNow, we had our inner network\nwith our router, right, and\n\n192\n00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:22.927\nnow I wanna show you that this is\ntypically how our networks work today.\n\n193\n00:10:22.927 --> 00:10:28.142\nWe typically have some sort of core\nover here, right, where we have our core\n\n194\n00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:33.320\nswitch here connecting up to our\nother dozens or hundreds of switches.\n\n195\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.617\nNow notice here, for your CCENT\nobjectives, that you see a router here.\n\n196\n00:10:37.617 --> 00:10:41.021\nSo that's gonna provide the routing,, or\n\n197\n00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:44.890\nwhat they call IVR,\ninterVLAN routing, right?\n\n198\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.830\nBecause if we have something like this,\n\n199\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.510\nwe're gonna have something\ncalled Virtual LANs.\n\n200\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.222\nVirtual LANs which are breaking up of\nbroadcasting domains in a layer two\n\n201\n00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:55.930\nswitch network, right?\n\n202\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.222\nSo, by defaults switches\nare one day broadcast domain.\n\n203\n00:10:58.222 --> 00:11:00.147\nSo virtual LANS allow us\nto break those up and\n\n204\n00:11:00.147 --> 00:11:03.000\nwe'll get into much detail\nin a later episode.\n\n205\n00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.989\nBut nonetheless, I have to have some way\nto communicate between these VLANS and\n\n206\n00:11:07.989 --> 00:11:12.976\nI could use a layer three switch, right,\nan enterprise layer three switch, or\n\n207\n00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:13.661\na router.\n\n208\n00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:15.041\nRemember for your CCENT objectives,\n\n209\n00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.887\nthis was to tell you, it's either gonna\nbe an enterprise layer three switch,\n\n210\n00:11:17.887 --> 00:11:20.580\nand if they don't tell you that,\nthen you're gonna have to see a router.\n\n211\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.231\nIf you don't see a router,\nthat means you're one broadcast domain.\n\n212\n00:11:23.231 --> 00:11:25.420\nOkay, let's go ahead and\nwhat do you guys think?\n\n213\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.730\nDo you think Ronnie was paying attention?\n\n214\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.149\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wanna test him here.\n\n215\n00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:29.206\nWhat do you think?\n\n216\n00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:31.829\n[LAUGH] All right, Ronnie,\nwhat do you got here?\n\n217\n00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:33.489\nI'm gonna tell you right\nhere this is a hub.\n\n218\n00:11:33.489 --> 00:11:34.046\n>> All right.\n\n219\n00:11:34.046 --> 00:11:34.662\n>> What do you think you have?\n\n220\n00:11:34.662 --> 00:11:36.171\nHow many collisions and\nbroadcasts domains?\n\n221\n00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:40.222\n>> All right, so Todd, what I see here is,\nsince you told me it's a hub,\n\n222\n00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:43.780\nit's one big broadcast domain and\none collision domain.\n\n223\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.380\n>> Yep, I'm just gonna put b and c here.\n\n224\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.880\nThat's right, so\nwe're gonna have to look at these.\n\n225\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.841\nWe typically ask for\nthe CCENT aren't gonna see a hub,\n\n226\n00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.503\nbut you've gotta have\nthat foundation down so\n\n227\n00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:53.204\nyou understand the difference between\nhub switches and routers and so on.\n\n228\n00:11:53.204 --> 00:11:56.802\nTake a look over here, we've got, well,\nit tells you what it is here, bridge.\n\n229\n00:11:56.802 --> 00:12:01.075\nRemember, a bridge was just a low port\ndensity, but now we call them land\n\n230\n00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:05.230\nswitches with higher port density,\nASICS into much faster and so on.\n\n231\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.730\nGo ahead, what do we got here?\n\n232\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.330\n>> I'm gonna say that we have\none big broadcast domain.\n\n233\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.960\n>> Yup, no router.\n\n234\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.771\n>> With the bridge to\nseparate collision domains?\n\n235\n00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:15.458\n>> That's right.\n\n236\n00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:18.760\nEach collision, each bridge,\nswitchboard, or land switchboard\n\n237\n00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.840\nwould be its own collision domain, so\nwe'll have two collision domains, okay?\n\n238\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.000\nWhat do we got down there, Richard?\n\n239\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.204\n>> All right, so when we start seeing this\none, I have one big broadcast domain and\n\n240\n00:12:31.204 --> 00:12:35.011\nI'm gonna say three or\nfour collision domains.\n\n241\n00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:36.220\n>> All right what do you\nguys think out there?\n\n242\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:36.986\nIs he right?\n\n243\n00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.110\nWhat do you think?\n>> I'm gonna say four.\n\n244\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.900\n>> So, let's look over here,\nthis is definitely a switch port.\n\n245\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.030\nSo I mean, so we could just go to these\nswitches, one, two, three, four for sure.\n\n246\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.560\nBut this hub is just part of\nthis collision domain, so we\n\n247\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.460\nonly have four collision domains, so it's\none broadcast, four collision domains.\n\n248\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.472\nNow over here though,\nwe're throwing in another device.\n\n249\n00:12:56.472 --> 00:12:58.224\nDo you think you can do this guys?\n\n250\n00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:01.712\n>> All right, so with the router, I'm\ngonna just count up the router ports and\n\n251\n00:13:01.712 --> 00:13:04.450\nI'm gonna say we have three\ndifferent broadcast domains.\n\n252\n00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.380\n>> There he goes.\n\n253\n00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.210\nHe's got this one down.\n\n254\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.770\nSo, that's three broadcast domains,\nhow many collision domains?\n\n255\n00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.420\n>> I'm gonna say three as well.\n\n256\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.139\n>> Yeah, he's right.\nNow,\n\n257\n00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:15.003\na router's, we always say they\nbreak out broadcast domains, but\n\n258\n00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.369\nthey absolutely break out\ncollision domains as well.\n\n259\n00:13:17.369 --> 00:13:20.960\nAnd these are hubs, if they are switches\nyou've gotta count every port.\n\n260\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.170\nOkay, so great job.\n\n261\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.933\nSo, we have three collision domains.\n\n262\n00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:28.756\nOkay, so what we wanna remember from\nthis section, you've got routers,\n\n263\n00:13:28.756 --> 00:13:33.620\nswitches, hubs, switches break\nup collision domains by default.\n\n264\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.740\nRouters are gonna break\nup our broadcast domains,\n\n265\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.980\ngive us separate address\nspace over subnets and so on.\n\n266\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.878\nWe have wireless controllers now that\nmanage our wireless networks, right, so\n\n267\n00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:44.212\nyou have to remember that.\n\n268\n00:13:44.212 --> 00:13:48.676\nFirewalls, next generation firewalls, next\ngeneration IPS, right, internetworking,\n\n269\n00:13:48.676 --> 00:13:52.040\nwhen we put a router in there,\nand we need logical addressing.\n\n270\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.100\nHow we had to resolve names with DNS,\nARP, and then\n\n271\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.770\nmake sure that we understand the deference\nbetween collision and broadcast domains.\n\n272\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.950\n>> All right, well, Todd, thank you.\n\n273\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.510\nThat's a great summary of everything\nthat we've covered in this episode.\n\n274\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.670\nAnd that means it's a great place for\nus to also sign off then.\n\n275\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.634\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm you're host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n276\n00:14:08.634 --> 00:14:09.378\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n277\n00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:13.813\n>> And see us right here for more

The OSI was introduced when networking between disparate networks was more likely, Todd explains and then tells us where it’s particular usefulness may have passed.  Even so, Todd breaks down the 7 layers into the Upper Block and Lower Block introducing why we still use it today.  It’s main use is descriptive, essentially allowing us to understand how data is prepared for networking between endpoints.  He also describes how data is broken into PDUs called segments, packets and frames that help to get data to it’s destination.",

00:00:17.530\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.540\nAnd today were gonna take a look at ICND1,\nand in our studio today is going to be Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.625\nTodd Lammle, helping us make\nsure that we are clearly and\n\n6\n00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.080\nrazor-focused in on those exam objectives.\n\n7\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.330\n>> Thanks Ron, great to be back.\n\n8\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.030\nGuys, let's dive right in to the OSI\nmodel, let's stick to the objectives,\n\n9\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.490\nthey're a little bit smaller with this new\nexam than they have been in the past, so\n\n10\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.080\nthat's good news.\n\n11\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.780\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n12\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.900\nAll right, so the OSI model\nwas created in 1977, actually,\n\n13\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.680\nto allow disparate communications\nbetween different types of computers.\n\n14\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.760\nWe had DAK, Honeywell, IBM, and so on.\n\n15\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.840\nThat's all we had, guys, and because\nof the OSI, we came up with CompUSA,\n\n16\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.270\nright, that obviously changed our world.\n\n17\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.950\nBut, today, did we outlive\nthe purposefulness of the OSI model?\n\n18\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.170\nSure we did, because we run wireless or\nethernet, we run IP,\n\n19\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210\nwe run TCP, it's pretty much what everyone\nruns, so we don't really have, per se,\n\n20\n00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.380\ndisparate communications anymore,\nwe run protocol stack.\n\n21\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.790\nLet's go ahead and take a look that\nthe OSI actually created seven different\n\n22\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.570\nlayers, so we have the upper layers, the\napplication, presentation, session, and\n\n23\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.270\ngone are the days where you just have\nto memorize what those are, right?\n\n24\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.500\nThey're not gonna ask you,\nhey, what's the fourth layer?\n\n25\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.350\nThat was in 1998 for the first CCA,\nor something like that.\n\n26\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.640\nBut in the upper layers,\nthis gives us our user interface.\n\n27\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.460\nOur applications tautry interface.\n\n28\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.250\nIn the middle layers,\nthe transport network, they get our data,\n\n29\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.870\nthe data stream coming from the upper\nlayers, to another network.\n\n30\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.330\nSo we're going to segment the network and\nroute it.\n\n31\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.550\nAnd then on the bottom layers here,\n\n32\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.630\nwe're gonna put it on to the local\nnetwork where it's gonna be either\n\n33\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.570\nethernet some sort of ethernet all\nthe way up to 100 gig or wireless right.\n\n34\n00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.390\nIt's gonna be one of those two things.\n\n35\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.390\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at these two options.\n\n36\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.110\nSo again, we have an application up here\nan example of an application be something\n\n37\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.820\nlike Microsoft Word or something and\n\n38\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.360\nthe reason I say this because\nsomeone might ask you, hey.\n\n39\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.200\nWhere is a Microsoft Word reside\nanswers nowhere or maybe layer eight,\n\n40\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.960\nI imagine right?\n\n41\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.470\nIt comes down here and\nit talks to the user interface.\n\n42\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.670\nNow these upper layers here present\na solid interface for the data and then\n\n43\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.190\nwe take this and send it down to the lower\nlayers to be transmitted on the network.\n\n44\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.060\nSo the operator just encoded.\n\n45\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.570\nNow we do different things here.\n\n46\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.300\nWe do translation services, encryption and\nso on for the upper layers if that's used.\n\n47\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.000\nBut the other thing is this session\nlayer keeps the different applications\n\n48\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.330\nlayer data separate.\n\n49\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.550\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n50\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.890\nLet's say that you have a browser open,\none Facebook here and Facebook here,\n\n51\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.665\ntwo users, I don't know and whatever.\n\n52\n00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:47.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just something like that.\n\n53\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.750\nYou have two users,\nhow would the data node come in?\n\n54\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.610\nGot the same port numbers and\nit's got the same Facebook and so\n\n55\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.050\non, that's what the session layer does.\n\n56\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.790\nSo we do session multiplexing in there\nto be able to keep that data separate.\n\n57\n00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.090\nAlright, so the transport layer gives us\nreliable or unviable communication for\n\n58\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.770\nour data stream, because the data\ncomes down here, this is my data.\n\n59\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.080\nGonna come down here, the transport\nlayer where we have possibly and\n\n60\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.330\ntypically reliable communication.\n\n61\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.120\nThen we're gonna come down here to\nthe network layer where we're going to\n\n62\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.920\nbe routed through the Internet work\nusing some sort of routed protocol.\n\n63\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.120\nWhat are two examples today,\n\n64\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.100\nRonnie, of routed protocols\nthat we'll us there today?\n\n65\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.270\n>> Routed protocols?\n\n66\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.110\nIP is one.\n\n67\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.080\n>> IP.\n\n68\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.470\nAnything else?\n\n69\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.310\nIpx or something?\n\n70\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.920\n>> IPX.\n\n71\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.030\nI could've fooled him\nif I said in use today.\n\n72\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.350\nSee that's now the CCnet would get you.\n\n73\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.140\nThey wouldn't ask you so simple,\nbut they'd say in use today, and\n\n74\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.060\nthe answer is what?\n\n75\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.460\nIPv6 isn't it.\n\n76\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.110\n>> IPv6 yep.\n>> IPX was absolutely an answer and\n\n77\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.030\nit was on answer all the way\nup until the early 80's.\n\n78\n00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.040\nAnyways, now we come down here And this\nnow is my local network here, isn't it?\n\n79\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.740\nThis is now, getting on my local network,\nand we're going to get the data ready for\n\n80\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.530\ntransmission either on ethernet or\nwireless at this point here.\n\n81\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.020\nNow up at our upper layers, there's\ntwo applications that in protocols,\n\n82\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.590\nin processes, that Cisco wants you\nto really understand for the secant.\n\n83\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.570\nYou really have to understand this.\n\n84\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.290\nI have this in multiple chapters in my\nbook explaining this in different ways.\n\n85\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.510\nDNS gives us our name resolution right,\nname to IP address resolution.\n\n86\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.660\nIf we did not have that today\nwe really could not communicate,\n\n87\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.050\nit would be pretty tough.\n\n88\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.480\nRight now we know from our earlier example\nwhere Bob talked to Sally right, and\n\n89\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.320\nwe could use her IP address because it\nis pretty easy with IP version 4, or\n\n90\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.800\neasier But not to get to the internet; for\nexample, what's Cisco's IP address?\n\n91\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.760\nYou'd have to type in www the ip\naddress or just type in the IP address.\n\n92\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.990\nSo the point is, when we get to IPv6,\nthat's impossible, so\n\n93\n00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.150\nDNS become extremely important.\n\n94\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.460\nNow, what does DHCP do?\n\n95\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.290\nIt's been around for a long time, guys.\n\n96\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.771\nAnd it started off in the late\n70's/early 80's as boot:he,\n\n97\n00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:57.680\nwhen we had disclose workstations and so\non, and DHP rides on top of boot:he today.\n\n98\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.610\nEveryone says 'well,\nit gives me my IP address', no no no,\n\n99\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.550\nit gives you much more than that,\nit gives IP configuration to host.\n\n100\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.110\nIP, subnet mask,\ndefault gateway, DNS, WINS.\n\n101\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.860\nOption 43, if you know what that is,\nthat's vender specific information,\n\n102\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.130\nso we can go way out there with DHCP,\nmore than most people would realize.\n\n103\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.450\nNow, we have remember something called\nDORA, so how does a client come up?\n\n104\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.520\nFirst of all it comes up and says hey\nHelp me, I don't have an IP address,\n\n105\n00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.280\nI'm a DHCP client, no one gave\nme an IP address, I'm a nobody.\n\n106\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.820\nRight?\nSo it\n\n107\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.520\nsends out the source IP address of all\nzeros and it sends this out as a discover.\n\n108\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.260\nRight?\nSo we've got discover,\n\n109\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.150\nthen the server [INAUDIBLE] goes well,\nI can offer you this.\n\n110\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.730\nAnd for this long Right,\nand it comes back and\n\n111\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.960\nit goes, well, I've been using\nthis address, I'd prefer that, so\n\n112\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.600\nit's going to request and then it's going\nto come back and its gonna say okay, fine.\n\n113\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.180\nAnd this is cool, I'm somebody now, I've\ngot an IP address, mask, gateway and more.\n\n114\n00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.180\nI've got all that and how did it get it?\n\n115\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.190\nWith something called DORA.\n\n116\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.500\nThat's how you're gonna remember it.\n\n117\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.340\nDiscover, offer, request, acknowledge.\n\n118\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.230\nThe Transport Layer typically gives\nus our reliable communication but\n\n119\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.400\nI'm sure that as you're all aware it can\ngive us unreliable communication as well.\n\n120\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.350\nNow we only use two protocols today.\n\n121\n00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.610\nRonnie, what do you think\nthose two protocols are?\n\n122\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.490\n>> One is gonna be UDP and\nthe other one is TCP.\n\n123\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.010\n>> That's right.\n\n124\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.620\nI have them listed down here.\n\n125\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.420\nThere is UDP that's my connection less and\n\n126\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.860\nTCP is my connection oriented gives us\na reliable session, not guaranteed but\n\n127\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.940\nreliable, it's more reliable and\nwe'll talk about how that happens.\n\n128\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.470\nSo this is a the transport layer\nthere also something here called\n\n129\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.070\nthe Protocol Data Unit,\n\n130\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.910\nthis is nothing really it's just way to\ndefine the data at any certain layer.\n\n131\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.730\nThe upper PDUs is called data\nThe transport layer, the PDU,\n\n132\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.820\nwhen it gets a header, right?\n\n133\n00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.710\nWe get the piece of the data,\nis called a segment, why?\n\n134\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.070\nBecause we're gonna take the data stream.\n\n135\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.110\nWe're gonna break it up so we can transmit\nit on the network into smaller segments.\n\n136\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.780\nLet's go ahead and take a look at\nreliable network communication.\n\n137\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.850\nThat happens with TCP.\n\n138\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:16.270\nSo remember, no connection is guaranteed,\nbut it can be reliable if TCP is used.\n\n139\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.720\nThe reason UDP is there is to give\nthe application developer options.\n\n140\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.960\nYou don't got a choice guys.\n\n141\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.460\nWhen you boot up you say, I think I'm\ngonna use UDP today, cuz I'm in a hurry.\n\n142\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.970\nIke, you don't have that option,\nit comes with the application you choose.\n\n143\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.080\nSo in this case here,\nwhat a reliable session?\n\n144\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.530\nA reliable session means\na virtual circuit is set up and\n\n145\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.430\nwe'll take a look at the virtual\nsession setup on the next screen, but\n\n146\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.370\nin this case here, once that's set\nup we get a reliable session and\n\n147\n00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.950\nthat gives me, and\nthat happens by sequencing.\n\n148\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.960\nWe're gonna number the segments.\n\n149\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.430\nBecause remember we're\ntaking the data stream,\n\n150\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.250\nbreaking it into smaller pieces for\ntransmission on the network.\n\n151\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.170\nSo we're going to sequence it.\n\n152\n00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.070\nThen we're gonna do flow control, okay.\n\n153\n00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.440\nThat flow control happens on the receiver.\n\n154\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.940\nThis is important for your CCN objectives.\n\n155\n00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:04.690\nThe receiver can control the transmission\nspeed of the transmitter right,\n\n156\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.670\nand slow it down if its\nbuffers are getting full.\n\n157\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.370\nBecause if its Receivers' buffers are\ngetting full, then we're gonna lose data\n\n158\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.980\nand we're no longer reliable\ncuz we're dropping packets.\n\n159\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.950\nSo flow control.\n\n160\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.270\nThen after we receive everything, we're\ngoing to acknowledge it based on my what\n\n161\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.320\nis called window size,\nwhich is part of my flow control, okay.\n\n162\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.590\nNow so\nwe're gonna to send acknowledgement.\n\n163\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.830\nSo we have Okay,\n\n164\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:31.050\nso first off we have to set up something\ncalled port numbers, port numbers.\n\n165\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.800\nat the transfer layer.\n\n166\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.420\nAnd this defines a couple things.\n\n167\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.510\nOne is my source port number which I\nrandomly make up between a number range,\n\n168\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.370\nand then my destination port\nnumber is one I'm gonna do.\n\n169\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.070\nSo if I was doing FTP,\nI would do Destination port would be 21.\n\n170\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.310\nTalent would be 23,\nHTP would be 80, and so on.\n\n171\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.500\nNow, in that case,\nnow we're going to acknowledge this.\n\n172\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.950\nAnd if I'm doing flow control and things\ncome in too fast, I'm gonna slow down\n\n173\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.080\nthe transmitter with my flow\ncontrol mechanism called windowing.\n\n174\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.610\nRight?\n\n175\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.550\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at this one last thing,\n\n176\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.810\nTCP provides synchronized communication\nbetween the transmitter receivers and\n\n177\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.780\ntake a look at that.\n\n178\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.070\nSo when a sender come ups it\nsends a sync pocket, right?\n\n179\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.502\nSo this is called three-way handshake,\na three-way handshake\n\n180\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.480\nSo we sync the receiver if it\nagrees with the terms port numbers,\n\n181\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.200\nflow control, sequence number,\nwindowing size.\n\n182\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.970\nIf it agrees with all that,\nit's going to send back a sync app.\n\n183\n00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.210\nIt also might change the windowing size,\n\n184\n00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.840\nif you look at an analyser you'll see\nthis happen, you'll see the sync.\n\n185\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.680\nThe SYN/ACK comes back and says, I like\neverything but the window size is too big.\n\n186\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.440\nSo I'm gonna recommend something else.\n\n187\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.570\nAnd then the sender then gets that and\nsays, okay, I agree with all your terms.\n\n188\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.340\nLet's create a session.\n\n189\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.990\nNow we can't transmit any segments\nuntil this session is complete.\n\n190\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.600\nAll right, that's the TCP 3-way handshake.\n\n191\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.200\nAll right and at the network layer we\nhave something called routed protocols.\n\n192\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.130\nYou've heard of this routed protocols.\n\n193\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.790\nAn example of routed protocols is IP which\n\n194\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.770\nrefers to IP version\nfour if you just say IP.\n\n195\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.290\nThe other routed protocol\nwe have here is IPV six.\n\n196\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.850\nNow both of these are routed protocols\nthat are defined as Logical addressing and\n\n197\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.010\nrouting through an Internet network.\n\n198\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.810\nSo both of these,\nyou wanna think of as mailmen.\n\n199\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:33.900\nSo they're going to look at the routing\ntable, they're going to provide logical\n\n200\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.780\naddressing, read logical addressing, and\ndo routing through an Internet network.\n\n201\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.630\nSo now we have, if you look at this,\n\n202\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.480\nwe have data coming down here to the\ntransport layer which gives us segments.\n\n203\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.980\nWhich comes down to the network layer, but\n\n204\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:52.060\nnow we have our protocol data\nunit is called a packet.\n\n205\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.880\nA packet.\n\n206\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.150\nSo IP is defined here as your well ware,\nbut we also have something called ICMP.\n\n207\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.030\nVery important for\nwhat diagnostics and, for example,\n\n208\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.480\nwhat would be used here for diagnostics?\n\n209\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.450\nI know what you're thinking,\nping and trace route, or just trace.\n\n210\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.300\nAnd Microsoft uses TRACERT,\nbut it's not the same.\n\n211\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.700\nThat wasn't work on a Cisco router so we\nwon't answer that on a Cisco exam, right?\n\n212\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.580\nAll right, so ping and trace, but\nwe also get destination unreachables.\n\n213\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.140\nDestination unreachables.\n\n214\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.200\nNow a router works at the network layer,\ndoesn't it?\n\n215\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.240\nSo we're gonna have our, these are our\nbroadcaster mains, here and here.\n\n216\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.210\nRight?\nSo we have two broadcast domains here,\n\n217\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.760\neach with 2 subnets.\n\n218\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.000\nAnd then we possibly could\nhave serial WAN connections,\n\n219\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.410\nyou absolutely have to have a serial WAN,\na router to do this.\n\n220\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.660\nIt's very rare in today's networks\nthat we still see serial WAN's.\n\n221\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.820\nThere's some out there, but I go to a lot\nof my customers that just don't have it\n\n222\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.520\nanymore because they're running MPLS or\nPGP and so on, and so\n\n223\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.100\nwe have our LAN connections going\nacross our LAN, so we need PNs, right?\n\n224\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.760\nBut there is some, when we get to\nthe WAN section in ICD2, not ICD1.\n\n225\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.280\nWe are going to have some\nserial connections in there.\n\n226\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.760\nWe just don't have the same as\nwhat we had in the last CCA.\n\n227\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.530\nSo remember each router LAN\ninterface is a broadcast domain.\n\n228\n00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.650\nRouters break up broadcast domains\nby filtering on Layer 3 information.\n\n229\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.610\nAnd also what's very important here is if\na broadcast comes in from Bob it's not.\n\n230\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.760\nForward to the cross router to\nany other interface is dropped.\n\n231\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.610\nVery important to understand.\n\n232\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.980\nAt the data link layer, remember,\nlet's go through this again.\n\n233\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.990\nWe had data up here.\n\n234\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.340\nSend the data stream down\nto the transport layer.\n\n235\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.375\nFrom the transport layer we send\nit down to the network layer.\n\n236\n00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:44.356\n[COUGH] And\n\n237\n00:12:44.356 --> 00:12:47.130\nso we get to data,\nwhat's at the transport layer?\n\n238\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.390\nThen we're gonna have what, segments.\n\n239\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.880\nAt the network layer we have what?\n\n240\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.390\n>> Packets.\n\n241\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:59.110\n>> Packets, okay, so now we come down to\nthe data link layer and we have what?\n\n242\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.990\nFrames, frames.\n\n243\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.240\nSo the PDU is frames.\n\n244\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.740\nBecause we're gonna take the packet,\nso if this is my packet, I'm\n\n245\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.630\ngonna put a header in there and\na trailer, kind of like bookends, so\n\n246\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.280\nwe're going to encapsulate\nthe frame with control information.\n\n247\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.070\nIn the header we'll find\nout the next episode\n\n248\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.510\nwhat's in that header\nin this ethernet frame.\n\n249\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.070\nBut now that we have this,\nwe have a frame,\n\n250\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.000\nnow we send it down to the physical layer.\n\n251\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.090\nCuz this is sent out in bytes,\nto be put into bits, and\n\n252\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.785\nencoded within a digital or analog signal.\n\n253\n00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:39.206\n[SOUND] Right.\n\n254\n00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:42.519\nNow one last thing guys for\nyour objectives, for your CN objectives so\n\n255\n00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.000\npay attention here.\n\n256\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.100\nYou have your physical and\nlogical topologies.\n\n257\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.130\nNow let's define these.\n\n258\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.380\nA physical topology is the actual\ncable layout in your network.\n\n259\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.310\nThe logical topology is defined\n\n260\n00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.450\nAs the digital signal that\ntraverses that physical topology.\n\n261\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.180\nThey can be different.\n\n262\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.710\nFor example here, if I look at this bus\ntopology here, I have a physical bus, and\n\n263\n00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.970\nthen my signal is gonna\ntravel down the wire,\n\n264\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.240\nstop at in this location,\njust like a bus going down a street.\n\n265\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.770\nWe have the ring topology, we have token.\n\n266\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:20.840\nNow I pretty much only see these in\nlarge metro ethernet with like Sonnet or\n\n267\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.100\nsomething today.\n\n268\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.150\nI don't see too much Mesh but\nMesh gives us the most flexibility and\n\n269\n00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.030\nredundancy and then but\nwe usually use a star topology.\n\n270\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.540\nThis is also refered to as a hybrid,\nisn't it?\n\n271\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.730\nA hybrid technology.\n\n272\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.450\nThe hybrid is, basically, we have on\nphysical topology But we have a different\n\n273\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.550\ntype of, one physical topology but\na different type of logical topology.\n\n274\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.840\nSo our networks today\nare physical stars right,\n\n275\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.530\nthink about switches the wires coming\nfrom all directions, logical bus.\n\n276\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.079\nBecause that's the way ethernet runs.\n\n277\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.940\nAll right Todd, well thank you again for\nthat introduction to the OSI model.\n\n278\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.290\nAnd reminding us of all the things\nthat we need to be concerned about.\n\n279\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.890\nGreat thing again that Todd actually\nreminded us is that on the OSI model,\n\n280\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.800\nespecially for the exam,\nis not as big of a focus but\n\n281\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.500\nit doesn't mean it's not important.\n\n282\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.590\nSo we wanna make sure that we do\npay attention to the OSI model,\n\n283\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.630\nis break down into it's\nPDU components as well.\n\n284\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.870\nAnd also pay attention to those brief\nprotocols, especially in the transport\n\n285\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.720\nlayer, and of course in the network layer,\nand in the datalink layer as well.\n\n286\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.380\nThese are actually great things\nthat we have to think about.\n\n287\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.360\nAnd lastly here, Tom,\n\n288\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.610\nremind us of the basic type of topologies,\nbeing able to distinguish between physical\n\n289\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:35.250\ntopologies as well as logical topologies\nis also going to be important there too.\n\n290\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.890\nSo in that sense there is a great\nbit of information here but\n\n291\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.610\nwe're actually nicely\npackaged in this one episode.\n\n292\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.700\nThan you again Tod for helping us here,\nthank you for joining us, signing of\n\n293\n00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.830\nIT Pro TV I'm your host Ronnie Wong\n>> Tod Lemley\n\n294\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.785\n>> Stay tuned right here for more CCENT\n\n295\n00:15:54.785 -->

Wong.\n\n3\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.290\nAnd today we'll be taking ICND1.\n\n4\n00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.439\nAnd in our studio we have Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.770\nTodd Lammle to help us to make sure that\nwe are focused in and ready for the exam.\n\n6\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.160\nWelcome back to our studio, Todd.\n\n7\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.185\n>> Thanks guys, hey, we're gonna head more\ndirectly into some more objectives guys\n\n8\n00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:36.080\non the TCP/IP model, we're gonna look at\nsome protocols, some headers, and so on.\n\n9\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.430\nSo let's pay attention and\nhit these objectives hard, let's do it.\n\n10\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.740\nAll right, first off, we have two\nmodels now, the DoD and the OSI.\n\n11\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.700\nSo let's take a look at the original DoD\nwhich was created before the OSI model.\n\n12\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.840\nDepartment of Defense.\n\n13\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.025\nNow this was upgraded by Cisco\nin the last CCNA objectives.\n\n14\n00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:59.850\nRight, so we're gonna compare this\nto the OSI model which had seven\n\n15\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.440\nlayers where we only have four here,\nwe have seven here.\n\n16\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.094\nThe application layer encompassed all of\nthe specifications from the application\n\n17\n00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:10.970\ndevelopers for\nwriting code into the stack.\n\n18\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.710\nSo it kinda made sense,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n19\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.620\nSo although we have three here, if you\nlook like NetBIOS or something like that\n\n20\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.250\nit's one protocol that encompasses all\nthe specifications of the upper layers.\n\n21\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.610\nSo again, DoD is,\nmodel is pretty much what we use.\n\n22\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.960\nNow [COUGH] the transport layer Cisco is\nnow calling this the transport layer,\n\n23\n00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.770\nso you have to be aware of that.\n\n24\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.490\nBut originally by the DoD,\nthey call it host to host layer.\n\n25\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.260\nSo I still do.\n\n26\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.120\nI use that.\n\n27\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.660\nSo, if we look at the top layer,\nthey're calling application.\n\n28\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.100\nIt was called the process application,\nthe process application layer.\n\n29\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.370\nAnd then the host to host layer typically,\nit's just called the transport layer but\n\n30\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.630\nwe'll see it both ways but\nthose terms are interchangeable.\n\n31\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.360\nAnd then we have the internet layer.\n\n32\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.310\nNow, this one,\nthey say they didn't change.\n\n33\n00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.340\nThis one, that's where we got the name for\nthe internet, obviously,\n\n34\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.370\nbecause this is where routing occurred,\nwhere IP sat, right.\n\n35\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.780\nIn the OSI that was the network layer.\n\n36\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.400\nIn the bottom layer, they didn't have\nany protocols as this was called Link.\n\n37\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.950\nOr really the original name\nwas Network Access, right?\n\n38\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.270\nAnd now it's just called Link.\n\n39\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.008\nAnd then those reference\nthe physical layer in land drive.\n\n40\n00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.230\nSo it kinda makes sense because if you\nhave, let's say, an ethernet card,\n\n41\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.380\nthe physical specifications and\n\n42\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.600\nthen the land drive are all\nin one protocol here, right.\n\n43\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.030\nSo we're gonna look at this.\n\n44\n00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.620\nSo it's a condensed version\nof the OSI model, isn't it?\n\n45\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.440\nSo if we look at the protocols that\nI cover in my chapter here, and\n\n46\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.470\nwe'll get through these in another\nlater episode, we have Telnet, right?\n\n47\n00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.190\nTelnet is,\ndoes anyone know what that stands for?\n\n48\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860\nYou know that is an acronym for something.\n\n49\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.900\nDoes anyone know?\n\n50\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.918\nIt actually stands for\nTelephone network [LAUGHING].\n\n51\n00:02:54.918 --> 00:02:56.860\nNo-one knows that, Telephone Network.\n\n52\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.315\nAnd it basically makes your terminal\na dumb terminal that lets you run\n\n53\n00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:02.690\nprogrammes; you can't transfer\nfiles out of them kinda cool but\n\n54\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.078\nit just lets you run\nprogrammes on another device.\n\n55\n00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.485\nSSH, right, secure shell,\n\n56\n00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:13.260\nthat gives us a connection like Telnet,\nbut that's encrypted.\n\n57\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.130\nFile transfer protocol let's us transfer\nfiles in a connection orientated manner,\n\n58\n00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.470\nmeaning that it uses TCP.\n\n59\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.310\nMost of these use TCP here, all right.\n\n60\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.790\nAnd then we should know our port\nnumbers as well, this is 23.\n\n61\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.920\nRonnie, you know what SSH is?\n\n62\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.670\n>> Should be 22.\n\n63\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.669\n>> It is 22.\n\n64\n00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.503\nWhat about FTP?\n\n65\n00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.012\n>> Should be 20 and 21.\n\n66\n00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.260\n>> Yeah, it is 20, 20 and 21,\nit's good to remember both.\n\n67\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.500\nAnd the reason why is when I\nconfigure ASAs and firewalls and so\n\n68\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.850\non, different types of firewalls,\nif you go out 21,\n\n69\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.300\nyou're gonna come back\na different port number.\n\n70\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.480\nAnd firewalls kind of freak\nout about stuff like that.\n\n71\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.623\nThe ASAs know how to\nhandle that automatically.\n\n72\n00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:49.849\nBut some firewalls don't, so\n\n73\n00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.069\nyou really do have to understand that FTP\ndoes come back a different port number.\n\n74\n00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.857\nTFTP?\n\n75\n00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:55.902\nI don't remember now.\n\n76\n00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.039\n>> Guess.\n\n77\n00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:01.056\n>> First off, it's UDP, and uses port 69.\n\n78\n00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:05.160\nSNMP?\n\n79\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.530\n>> 161?\n>> It is 161.\n\n80\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.630\nSimple network management protocol helps\nus gather information about our network\n\n81\n00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.730\nand that's definitely an objective that I\nsee in D2 so we'll go through that later.\n\n82\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.100\nAnd that's gonna use, well, for\nthe most part it uses UDP but\n\n83\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.280\ncan be configured for TCP and\nversion three just uses TCP.\n\n84\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.040\nHTTP, I think you know that one.\n\n85\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.130\n>> Port 80.\n\n86\n00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760\n>> And TCP, whoops, I had these backwards.\n\n87\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.775\nI'm putting the numbers where,\nthat goes there.\n\n88\n00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:38.030\n>> [LAUGH] So this is AD and\nTCP and that HTTPS.\n\n89\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.830\n>> 443.\n\n90\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.154\n>> Right, TCP and 443.\n\n91\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.932\nNetwork time protocol, NTP.\n\n92\n00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:47.040\nObviously it gives us time.\n\n93\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.300\n>> 123?\n>> It's easy to remember, cuz it's 123.\n\n94\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.310\n[LAUGH] And that uses, I guess UDP?\n\n95\n00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.841\n>> Yeah.\n>> DNS?\n\n96\n00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:56.341\n>> 53?\n\n97\n00:04:56.341 --> 00:05:03.750\n>> It is 53, and okay, and.\n\n98\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.260\n>> DHCP?\n>> You couldn't have been wrong here!\n\n99\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.060\n>> It uses both!\n\n100\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.860\n>> Both, sorry!\n\n101\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.745\n>> So if I go out hey,\n\n102\n00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:13.770\nwhat's the IP address for lynda.com\nit's gonna come back that's a UDP query.\n\n103\n00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.040\nIf I'm a server, I need to go to my route\nserver to get the answer then I'm gonna\n\n104\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.910\nuse TCP right, in order or\nto do zone updates, right?\n\n105\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.730\nNow DHCP/BootP 67, 68.\n\n106\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.510\nUDP for sure.\n\n107\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.460\nAnd APIPA,\nI have no idea what that is protocol.\n\n108\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.010\nThat's what is APIPA?\n\n109\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.460\nThat is hilarious they have this in here.\n\n110\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.540\n>> That's the automatic\nprivate IP address.\n\n111\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.615\n>> Commonly referred to\nas the crap address.\n\n112\n00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:42.190\n[LAUGH] Isn't that right?\n\n113\n00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.730\nDon't you always say that when you get it?\n\n114\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.161\nI maybe say something\nsometimes something worse.\n\n115\n00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:47.234\n[LAUGH] But that's my crap.\n\n116\n00:05:47.234 --> 00:05:48.980\nBecause when you get that,\nthe 169.254 address,\n\n117\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.650\nthat means you didn't get\nan address from a DHCP server.\n\n118\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.958\nRight, and you're like man.\n\n119\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.112\nAll right.\n\n120\n00:05:56.112 --> 00:06:00.120\nTCP/UDP Header,\nthis is important to understand here guys.\n\n121\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.760\nFIrst off let's take a look, so we have\nour source and destination port numbers.\n\n122\n00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.430\nAll right, so I have my port number here,\nthis is my source.\n\n123\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.880\nAnd what's the range, guys,\n\n124\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.748\nthat's typically is gonna\nbe my source port number?\n\n125\n00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:12.911\n>> The range?\n\n126\n00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:15.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n127\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.110\nIt starts 1024.\n\n128\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.928\n>> All the way up to 65535.\n\n129\n00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:22.270\n>> 65535.\n\n130\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.200\nAnd the destination port numbers.\n\n131\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.530\nTypically well known port numbers\ndon't always have to be, but\n\n132\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.150\nlet's just pretend well-known\nport numbers, what's our range?\n\n133\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.388\n>> 1 through 1,023?\n\n134\n00:06:32.388 --> 00:06:33.485\n>> That is correct.\n\n135\n00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:34.362\n>> Or 0?\n\n136\n00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:35.830\n0 through-\n>> It is 0, 0 to 1,023.\n\n137\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.035\nAnd so then we have our sequence number,\n\n138\n00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:42.910\nour acknowledgment number and\nour window size.\n\n139\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.840\nThese guys should sound familiar.\n\n140\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.050\nWhat do those do?\n\n141\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.400\nRonnie, what do those\nthree things give us?\n\n142\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.910\n>> Those are helping us with reliable-\n>> Reliable communications.\n\n143\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.720\nSo we have our virtual circuit, Ronnie,\nand then we get reliable communications\n\n144\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.890\nthrough TCP by using sequencing,\nacknowledging and windowing.\n\n145\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.330\nPlus take a look, let's jump ahead\ndown here to our UDP header,\n\n146\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.070\nand we're gonna see that we have\nall sort of wait, no, we don't.\n\n147\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.320\nWe have nothing.\n\n148\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.260\nWe have a small little edit.\n\n149\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.020\nWe have our source port, destination port,\nwe run a full checksum here, right?\n\n150\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.410\nWe don't trust the lower layers,\nso we're gonna run a full CRC.\n\n151\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.130\nWe have a length field.\n\n152\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.590\nWhere's our reliability?\n\n153\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.170\nWhere's our acknowledgements?\n\n154\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.310\nNot gonna happen.\n\n155\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.290\nThat's why people use VPN.\n\n156\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.100\nWe typically use it for\nvoice and video, don't we?\n\n157\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.110\nSo because, let me ask you a question,\nif you and your kid was watching a video\n\n158\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.440\na children's video on how to read\nthe alphabet, and you sent it with TCP and\n\n159\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.050\nsomething came out of order, they wouldn't\nlearn the alphabet, I think, wrong.\n\n160\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.190\nCuz it would go a, b, c, s, j, k,\ncuz I mean TCP would try to fix it and\n\n161\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.220\nreorder it and\nit would come out of order at that point.\n\n162\n00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.574\nSo we hit it as UDP and you either hit\nit or you don't, right, all right.\n\n163\n00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:58.625\nSo, now, let's take a look at\na couple of things in the TCP header,\n\n164\n00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:02.629\nwe're gonna look at the port numbers,\nsequencing.\n\n165\n00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:06.128\nRight this gives us our reliability.\n\n166\n00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:06.651\n>> Right.\n\n167\n00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:07.532\n>> Here's our reliability.\n\n168\n00:08:07.532 --> 00:08:10.787\nAll right, and then we can see\nthat UDP we don't have that.\n\n169\n00:08:10.787 --> 00:08:16.696\nNow at the transport layer so\nwe have our protocols TCP and\n\n170\n00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:22.357\nUDP best effort, reliable And\nTCP as you are well aware\n\n171\n00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:28.164\nis connection oriented and\nthe UDP is connection less.\n\n172\n00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:33.353\nSequencing, alright so we have\nsequencing what means numbering right.\n\n173\n00:08:33.353 --> 00:08:37.080\nAs we send our segments out\nwe're going to number them.\n\n174\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.497\nSo they can put them\nback in the right order.\n\n175\n00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:40.006\nWe don't have that with UDP.\n\n176\n00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:42.600\nSo again we got our voice and\nvideo over here.\n\n177\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.330\nAnd pretty much for everything else\nwe use TCP today, pretty a lot.\n\n178\n00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.580\nSo remember our three way handshake,\nright.\n\n179\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.440\nI'm gonna sync and\n\n180\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.150\none of the three parameters I'm gonna send\nout if I'm using TCP for reliability.\n\n181\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.990\n>> Is sequencing flow control or\nacknowledgements?\n\n182\n00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.780\n>> Acknowledgements.\n\n183\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.455\n>> Acknowledgements.\n\n184\n00:09:00.455 --> 00:09:01.250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, right.\n\n185\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.120\nso sequencing.\n\n186\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.000\nMeans flow control with windowing.\n\n187\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.950\nSo we sync, sync ack, we acknowledge that.\n\n188\n00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.510\nThis is my three way handshake.\n\n189\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.780\nAnd then my session is established.\n\n190\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.240\nAll right?\nNow we have a reliable session.\n\n191\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.580\nNow to look at our port numbers here,\nwe have our transporter.\n\n192\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:29.840\nNotice in my network layer,\nThese are my routed protocols.\n\n193\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.449\nIPv4 and IPv6 all right so\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Yes,\n\n194\n00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:39.309\nJohn, I'm famous [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.310\n>> That's funny.\n\n196\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.855\nSo notice that these guys can.\n\n197\n00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:45.290\n[LAUGH]\nThese guys can run.\n\n198\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.430\nSorry guys, we were laughing because\nwe're watching the chat screen on here.\n\n199\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.380\nBut anyways IPv4 or IPv6, does it matter?\n\n200\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.780\nIt doesn't right,\nthey both do the same thing.\n\n201\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.450\nLogical addressing and\nrouting through an inner network.\n\n202\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.100\nOkay.\nSo\n\n203\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.680\nnotice we use port numbers to define\nthe upper layer processor application.\n\n204\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.800\nRight?\nAnd as Ronnie and I went through,\n\n205\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.940\nwe got FTP, SSH, Telnet and\nsome different examples here.\n\n206\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.260\nSo, the port numbers are very important\nwhen it comes to the transport layer.\n\n207\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.490\nRight?\nTo help us define our virtual circuit and\n\n208\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.410\ndefine our process and application.\n\n209\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.460\nAt the internet layer,\nhere We have IP right?\n\n210\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.040\nWorks at the internet layer.\n\n211\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.830\nRight, in the OSI it's\ncalled the network layer but\n\n212\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.040\nthe internet layer makes sense here.\n\n213\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.300\nAgain the host to host layer or\nthe transport layer, TCP or UDP there.\n\n214\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.610\nNow IP operates at the internet layer,\nconnectionless.\n\n215\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.950\nNow, whats important to understand here\nguys is everything is connectionless\n\n216\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.700\nin the IP stack except TCP.\n\n217\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.540\nRight?\nSo whenever you look at\n\n218\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.620\nany other protocol,\nit's not even a question.\n\n219\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.120\nTCP is the only\nconnection-oriented protocol.\n\n220\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.350\nOkay, we use a hierarchical collagicin\nwith IP version 4, not so with 6.\n\n221\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.580\nAnd it's connection so we get best effort.\n\n222\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.890\nNo data recovery, doesn't even\nmatter what they run down here so\n\n223\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.210\nthey don't even list anything.\n\n224\n00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.240\nNow in the IP header,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n225\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.420\nI have my source and\ndestination IP addresses.\n\n226\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.120\nAlright these are all thirty-two bytes.\n\n227\n00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:22.645\nAnd we have a version,\na service type, total length.\n\n228\n00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:26.465\nNow the fragment offset, remember I'm\ngonna bring up a couple things because\n\n229\n00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:29.465\nwe're gonna compare these to IPv6 later.\n\n230\n00:11:29.465 --> 00:11:32.535\nThe fragment offset, we use that so\nwhen we take a packet and\n\n231\n00:11:32.535 --> 00:11:34.545\nit's too big to send down a link.\n\n232\n00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.820\nThe MTU isn't matching so\nwe're gonna Fragment that packet and\n\n233\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.390\nput it back together again\nalso using load balancing.\n\n234\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.430\nSo we use that fragment offset.\n\n235\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.950\nAnd the other thing is is\nthe time to live field.\n\n236\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.960\nSo this time to live field is used for\na couple things.\n\n237\n00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.320\nThe time to live field is used for\n\n238\n00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.000\ndiagnostics with trace route,\nwhich we'll get into.\n\n239\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.920\nBut also it just tells us how far\nthis packet can go before it has\n\n240\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.050\nto kill itself.\n\n241\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.390\nBecause if we didn't have\nthis time to live field,\n\n242\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.330\nwe might have packets whirling around\nthe world that were here from the 60s.\n\n243\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.910\nIt's possible, unlikely.\n\n244\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.630\nBut I'm just making a point.\n\n245\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.500\nNow what's the most important thing here\n\n246\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.830\nis this protocol field\nthat I talked about here.\n\n247\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.949\nSo we have our data right?\n\n248\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.640\nThis protocol field tells us what?\n\n249\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.700\n>> Who owns it.\n\n250\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.070\n>> Who owns this segment\nthat I'm carrying?\n\n251\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.210\nWho owns this, or\nit could be ICMP data, right?\n\n252\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:32.680\nSo if it's coming from TCP in\nthat protocol field down here,\n\n253\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:40.410\nwe'll look at this It's going to say,\nso this is my protocol field here.\n\n254\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:46.880\n0x06 or 0x17 right, for\nUDP and this is in hex, right.\n\n255\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.860\nSo in my protocol field it's going to find\nit, now again it could say 01 for ICMP but\n\n256\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.660\nif we have an ICMP diagram in there Right?\n\n257\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.180\nSo that protocol field is important.\n\n258\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.020\nSo the time to live field is and\nwe get to IPv6 is our hops field,\n\n259\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.150\nand we'll talk about these.\n\n260\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.660\nSo the fragment offset,\ntime to live, protocol field.\n\n261\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.660\nThose are important to us.\n\n262\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.060\nNow ICMP in action.\n\n263\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.210\nRemember it gives us diagnostics and\nerrors.\n\n264\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.560\nIt tells us about error.\n\n265\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.040\nSo in other words,\nthis server one Sends a packet to\n\n266\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.610\nthis router and says the destination\nIP address is 10.1.1.5.\n\n267\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.626\nWell this is ten,\nif we look at this closer, this is 10.1.5,\n\n268\n00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:27.915\nnot 10.1.1.5, okay.\n\n269\n00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:32.160\nSo this guy comes to the router and\nhe's directly\n\n270\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.160\nconnected to 10.1.5.0 says 10.1.1.0\nnetwork never heard of it, discard.\n\n271\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.700\nAnd it sends an ICMP error message\nback to the originating host.\n\n272\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.900\nSo we're out the same\nport it was received on.\n\n273\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.200\nSo that's ICMP destination\nunreachable messages.\n\n274\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.650\nWe also would use this for\nour program ping, right?\n\n275\n00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.780\nSo that would tell us if\na host is alive or not.\n\n276\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.280\nAnd that uses ICMP.\n\n277\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.310\nNow arp requests, arp broadcasts,\ntake a look at here.\n\n278\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.420\nSo I don't see the broadcast,\nbut an arp comes up and\n\n279\n00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.080\nsays, I need the Ethernet address.\n\n280\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.906\nNow remember, it says that I was at\ndestination MAC address, whoops not 255.\n\n281\n00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:17.720\nFF, FF, FF and so on, right.\n\n282\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.530\nThere's six fields.\n\n283\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.920\nSo we're gonna get our broadcast\nEthernet address sent out so\n\n284\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.910\nit goes to every host on your local LAN.\n\n285\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.250\nAnd the host will come back and\ngive us its MAC address, so now\n\n286\n00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.240\nwe can send data To that host now that we\nhave open we'll keep that in our app cash.\n\n287\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.900\nOkay now layer two broadcast\nit's important to understand so\n\n288\n00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.890\nhere's my broadcast sure I\nput six fields in there.\n\n289\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.590\nSo I'm gonna take that and\nI'm going to send this out and\n\n290\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.100\nit says everyone on my local network.\n\n291\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.370\nSo everyone picks it up including\nthis router in a phase.\n\n292\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:50.960\nNow if it's not for\n\n293\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.550\nthe router because who knows it could\nbe destined For the router, right, but\n\n294\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.610\nin, you know, for example, not coming\nfrom this host but if it was a broadcast.\n\n295\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.620\nOkay, so every host,\nhere's the problem with broadcast,\n\n296\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.205\nis every host including the router\nhas to read that broadcast.\n\n297\n00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:10.345\nIt has to read all the data just to find\nout why I don't run that protocol or\n\n298\n00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:11.495\nwhatever that was coming from.\n\n299\n00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:13.965\nSo, if it was coming from\nanother router and it was rip,\n\n300\n00:15:13.965 --> 00:15:17.065\nthat means every single\nhost would read that,\n\n301\n00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:20.325\nall the way up to the application layer,\nas a broadcast, just to be denied and\n\n302\n00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:23.185\nsay I don't want rip because\nthe rip runs in layer seven, right?\n\n303\n00:15:23.185 --> 00:15:26.065\nSo, this is why broadcasts aren't good,\nright?\n\n304\n00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:29.038\nOur layer three broadcast\nnow looks like this.\n\n305\n00:15:29.038 --> 00:15:35.690\nSo we have all Fs at Layer 2 and\nthen we have a Layer 3 broadcast here.\n\n306\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.342\nRight, it is all 1s or 255.255.255.255.\n\n307\n00:15:40.342 --> 00:15:45.020\nOkay, so that's going to tell everyone\nincluding this router to read this data.\n\n308\n00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.620\nSo we have a local LAN broadcast here.\n\n309\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.580\nAnd a layer 3 meaning all network,\nall host.\n\n310\n00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.760\nNow a unicast is slightly different,\nright?\n\n311\n00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.776\nSo we need to understand this.\n\n312\n00:15:55.776 --> 00:15:59.666\nSo this was one to all, right?\n\n313\n00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:03.823\nThe broadcast was one to all,\nsounds right?\n\n314\n00:16:03.823 --> 00:16:06.400\nLayer-2 Unicast is what?\n\n315\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.178\n>> One to one?\n\n316\n00:16:07.178 --> 00:16:10.160\n>> One to, yes.\n\n317\n00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.140\nOne, that's right.\n\n318\n00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.440\nSo the unicast is the actual IP address\n\n319\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.960\nthat you have on your host interface,\nyour NIC, right?\n\n320\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.620\nSo we're actually sending it to the body.\n\n321\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.340\nSo we can use the term unicast\nat layer-2 or at layer-3, right?\n\n322\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.960\nIf we know the MAC\naddress we send that out,\n\n323\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.460\nwe send out a unicast destination Mac or\na unicast destination IP address.\n\n324\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.420\nSo, notice everyone's going to read\nthis and say that's not for me.\n\n325\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.750\nIt says this is for me,\nwhoops I'm gonna jump ahead here.\n\n326\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.540\nThis is for me,\nnow I need to read the packet.\n\n327\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.880\nSo it's going to discard the frame and\npull the packet.\n\n328\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.500\nAnd what field in the frame tells\nit who to give the packet to?\n\n329\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:55.240\nOkay, so in the frame,\nwe had the ether type field.\n\n330\n00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.580\n>> Right.\n>> And inside there,\n\n331\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.040\nwe had 0x800 which says it was\nan IP packet and then so the router\n\n332\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.470\ndiscards the frame because they're only\nused locally, never go through a router.\n\n333\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.200\nTakes the packet and hands it to IP\nbecause that's who we said it's for.\n\n334\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.605\nRight, that's what that\nether type field is for.\n\n335\n00:17:12.605 --> 00:17:16.220\nS,o in this case here everyone's gonna\ndiscard it but here's the problem here.\n\n336\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.750\nEven on this we're a what's called\na broadcast multi access network.\n\n337\n00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.010\nBroadcast multisends.\n\n338\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.030\nWe just broadcast for everything, right.\n\n339\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.100\nThat was the way we\nfound all our services.\n\n340\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.020\nWorked pretty well for a lot of years.\n\n341\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.060\nAnyways, in this case here,\neveryone has to read this and\n\n342\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.180\ndetermine it's not for them.\n\n343\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.600\nAll right, so\nthat's not necessarily a problem.\n\n344\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.310\nIt's how our networks run today.\n\n345\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:45.520\nBut it can cause a lot of traffic, right,\nif we have large broadcast domains.\n\n346\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.070\nNow that being said,\nwe can use something called multicast.\n\n347\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.990\nThis can make our networks run\nbetter if we can figure our\n\n348\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.370\nrouters [INAUDIBLE] mode and go into\nmulticast and all that other stuff.\n\n349\n00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.860\nWe can create what's called multicast\ngroups, only certain people read them.\n\n350\n00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.229\nBut even if we don't have that,\n\n351\n00:18:00.229 --> 00:18:02.520\nit can make our networks\na little bit more efficient.\n\n352\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.233\nLet's take a look, so, here's\na router that says I'm running EIGRP.\n\n353\n00:18:06.233 --> 00:18:07.763\nThat means it's gonna send a multicast.\n\n354\n00:18:07.763 --> 00:18:10.984\nHere it is right here, 224.0.0.10.\n\n355\n00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:13.620\nThat says I'm the EIGRP with IP version 4.\n\n356\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.630\nIt said reserved\nmulti-class address right.\n\n357\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.840\nAnyway, so he comes out it goes\nout onto my broadcast domain,\n\n358\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.660\nright as a multi cast.\n\n359\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.620\nEveryone's going to read that frame,\nsays we see that multicast frame, but\n\n360\n00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.810\nwe don't run that protocol in\ndiscard that the data link layer.\n\n361\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.910\nSo this is important because instead of\nmy example with the broadcast with rip\n\n362\n00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.560\nwhich went to layer seven and\nall the hosts, and\n\n363\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.530\nthey have to process the millions\nof packets every minute or\n\n364\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.550\nso, depending upon how many routers\nyou have, it can be very chatty.\n\n365\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.689\nSo, that can use a lot of\nprocessing of your host.\n\n366\n00:18:46.689 --> 00:18:48.175\nThis stops that from happening,\ndoesn't it?\n\n367\n00:18:48.175 --> 00:18:49.592\nThe data link layer.\n\n368\n00:18:49.592 --> 00:18:51.171\nSo that's some efficiency here.\n\n369\n00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:57.093\nBut, multicast has other uses that\nare beyond the scope of this class.\n\n370\n00:18:57.093 --> 00:19:00.630\nNow with IP Addressing,\nwe can see that this is a,\n\n371\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.516\nthey have a hierarchical scheme, so\nwe can see that we have network,\n\n372\n00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:10.233\nthe class A, they made it into\ndifferent classes to hand them out to\n\n373\n00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:14.330\ndifferent corporations\nthat had different needs.\n\n374\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.139\nFor example, some of them didn't\nneed a lot of networks but\n\n375\n00:19:17.139 --> 00:19:18.270\nthey had a lot of hosts.\n\n376\n00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.390\nRight, so they came up with a Class A that\nsaid well you don't have very many\n\n377\n00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.993\nnetworks, but we have a lot of hosts.\n\n378\n00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:26.511\nThis is actually 24 bits of host,\nisn't it?\n\n379\n00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:28.624\nRight, 8, 16, 24.\n\n380\n00:19:28.624 --> 00:19:30.760\nThat's a lot, that's a lot.\n\n381\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.177\nWhat is that?\n>> [CROSSTALK] million.\n\n382\n00:19:32.177 --> 00:19:33.872\n>> Yeah, 65 million.\n\n383\n00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:37.410\nAnyways, in a Class B\nwe still have 16 bits.\n\n384\n00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.825\nSo if this was 16 million,\nthis is like what?\n\n385\n00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:40.708\n>> 65,000.\n\n386\n00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:42.263\n>> 65,000.\n\n387\n00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:47.110\nRight, hosts per network, and by the way\nyou can't install that anywhere on this\n\n388\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.989\nplanet or universe,\nmaybe somewhere else in another universe.\n\n389\n00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:55.864\nIs class C the first three bytes\nrepresent the network address and\n\n390\n00:19:55.864 --> 00:19:59.156\nthe last byte represents the network host.\n\n391\n00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:02.037\nOkay, so\nthis network host is only eight bits so\n\n392\n00:20:02.037 --> 00:20:04.426\nit only gives us Well with to minus two.\n\n393\n00:20:04.426 --> 00:20:07.716\nWe'll get into that but\nonly 254 hosts per networks.\n\n394\n00:20:07.716 --> 00:20:13.830\nSo right but anyways class A, the first\nbyte represents the network address.\n\n395\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.080\nThe last three bytes\nrepresent the host addresses.\n\n396\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.340\nIn a class B, the first two bytes\nrepresent the network address and\n\n397\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.320\nthe last two bytes represent\nthe host addresses.\n\n398\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.090\nSo you might see something like\nthis on the objective, guys,\n\n399\n00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:32.860\nwhich class of address gives you an equal\namount of bits for networks and hosts?\n\n400\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.820\nWell, what's your best answer?\n\n401\n00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.350\n>> Class B.\n\n402\n00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:40.360\n>> Yeah, but Class B is right, but\nis that truly, technically correct.\n\n403\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.060\nThe answer is it's not because we're not\nusing all the bits in the first two bytes.\n\n404\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.790\nRight, but that was the best answer for\nthe CC exam.\n\n405\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:54.300\nNow, in a Class C we have 24 bits for\na network so we have a lot of networks.\n\n406\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.820\nNot with very few hosts but\na lot of people do use this and we see it.\n\n407\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.630\nWe used to just call it\nthe Linksys address for\n\n408\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.600\na long time cuz what everyone knew it as,\n192.\n\n409\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.420\nAnd we'll get into those RC\naddresses in a second but\n\n410\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.790\nthe fact is it gives us a ton\nof networks with very few hosts.\n\n411\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.880\nBut still that's more than\na couple hundred hosts,\n\n412\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.990\nthat's way almost too big for\na broadcast domain today.\n\n413\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.670\nBecause of the things we just went\nthrough on the broadcast domains,\n\n414\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.150\nyou want to keep those small.\n\n415\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:26.050\nClass D was reserved for multicast and\nclass e was reserved for research.\n\n416\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.780\nSo when we get to IPV six we're gonna talk\nabout more of this wasted addresses and\n\n417\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.150\nall the billions of addresses\nwe wasted down here.\n\n418\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.290\nNow, that being said we have to define and\n\n419\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.300\nbe able to look at an address and\nknow where there's Class A, B or C.\n\n420\n00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.355\nWhy?\nSo whenever the host pits starts we know\n\n421\n00:21:41.355 --> 00:21:43.276\nwhen we could start subletting, all right?\n\n422\n00:21:43.276 --> 00:21:45.140\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n423\n00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.720\nSo in the Class A range, they said\nthe first bit must always be a 0, okay?\n\n424\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.224\nSo if I look at this,\n\n425\n00:21:52.224 --> 00:21:57.359\nthe value of the first binary place\nin the first octet can only be a 0.\n\n426\n00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:01.606\nThat means I have 7 other bits,\nand if I turn them all off,\n\n427\n00:22:01.606 --> 00:22:05.353\nthese other seven bits,\nmy decimal value is zero.\n\n428\n00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:10.490\nIf I turn on these other 27\nbits my decimal value is 127.\n\n429\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:17.322\nSo that means that my range on a class\na network is 0 to 127 which is true,\n\n430\n00:22:17.322 --> 00:22:21.889\nexcept Cisco reserved 0 for\nrouter broadcasts.\n\n431\n00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:23.870\nAnd 127 was reserved.\n\n432\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.130\nNow, this was how little they thought\nof IP Version 4 when it came out.\n\n433\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.677\nFor just what,\ndiagnostics are loopbacks, right?\n\n434\n00:22:29.677 --> 00:22:34.020\nSo we can ping 127001 or\n127 anything, really.\n\n435\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.352\nBut the fact is is that was reserved\njust to test your IP stack.\n\n436\n00:22:38.352 --> 00:22:42.733\nSo that's a lot of addresses, right?\n\n437\n00:22:42.733 --> 00:22:46.619\nAnd they just waste them because they\ndidn't really think IP 4 was gonna come of\n\n438\n00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:47.607\nanything, right?\n\n439\n00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:52.276\nSo if they reserve them, that makes my\naddress range, we'll come back over here,\n\n440\n00:22:52.276 --> 00:22:53.887\n1-126, doesn't it?\n\n441\n00:22:53.887 --> 00:22:55.220\nOkay so the first bit.\n\n442\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:01.703\nNow on the objectives, What is the bit\nvalue of, for Class A, Class B, Class C.\n\n443\n00:23:01.703 --> 00:23:03.420\nSo yes, we're paying attention here.\n\n444\n00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.848\nIn a Class B they say the first\nbit must always be on, but\n\n445\n00:23:07.848 --> 00:23:10.072\nthe second can never be on.\n\n446\n00:23:10.072 --> 00:23:14.226\nAll right, so your binary value must\nalways start with 10 when you're defining\n\n447\n00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.350\na Class B network address range.\n\n448\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.120\nThat means you have six other bits.\n\n449\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.220\nIf I turn them all off\nthe value of this byte is 128.\n\n450\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:27.350\nIf I turn the other ones back\non plus the 128 my value is 128.\n\n451\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:32.640\nSo my network address, my range is 128\nto 191 and that's how they get that.\n\n452\n00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.690\nDo we have to remember this?\n\n453\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.063\nYes you do.\nYou should absolutely know this.\n\n454\n00:23:37.063 --> 00:23:43.156\nNot just for the just pretty clear in\na Class C, they said it must be 110,\n\n455\n00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:49.356\nno exceptions, 110 which leaves us five\nbits to turn off and five bits to turn on.\n\n456\n00:23:49.356 --> 00:23:53.872\nOn, right, and that gives us our\nrange 192 to 223, all right?\n\n457\n00:23:53.872 --> 00:24:00.641\nAnd then a Class D range is 1110\nwhich is 224 to 239, right?\n\n458\n00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:02.558\nNot necessarily important but\nit's good to know.\n\n459\n00:24:02.558 --> 00:24:05.844\nOkay, so our range is here, so\nwe are going to know our class A,\n\n460\n00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:09.566\nB and C ranges, when we get in\nthe submits pre-recorded information,\n\n461\n00:24:09.566 --> 00:24:13.242\nwhen I talk about them, I'm gonna\nassume that you have this down pat.\n\n462\n00:24:13.242 --> 00:24:18.527\nClass A range 1 to 126, class B 128\n\n463\n00:24:18.527 --> 00:24:23.664\nto 191, in class C 192 to 223.\n\n464\n00:24:23.664 --> 00:24:28.940\nAll right, one more thing, and\nthat is public vs private addresses.\n\n465\n00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.820\nThere's an RFC that defines this.\n\n466\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.720\nIt was in the late 90s, '97 I think.\n\n467\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.220\nRFC 19?\n\n468\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:36.732\n>> 18\n>> 18.\n\n469\n00:24:36.732 --> 00:24:39.810\n[LAUGH] I should have tested you\n\n470\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.170\non that one,\nyou would have got a gold star.\n\n471\n00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.530\nThe private address range for\n\n472\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.980\na class A was reserved at\nanything that starts with 10.\n\n473\n00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:52.060\nIn a Class B it's 172.16, but\nwait everybody sees that 172.16,\n\n474\n00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.810\nbut it goes further, this is a slash 12.\n\n475\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.558\nSo meaning it's a lock size 16 here and\nwe'll get into that.\n\n476\n00:24:58.558 --> 00:24:59.142\n172.31.\n\n477\n00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:02.340\nSo 172.16 to 31 is is reserved.\n\n478\n00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.592\nWhat do this reserved\naddresses mean Ronnie?\n\n479\n00:25:06.592 --> 00:25:11.030\n>> Private address ranges one we\ncan use inside our own network but\n\n480\n00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.020\nthey are not allowed for\nus to be able to use on the internet Yes.\n\n481\n00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.440\nAnd that allowed to what extend\nthe life of IP Version 4.\n\n482\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.480\nSo I don't know if we should\nhate this guy or love this guy.\n\n483\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.930\nRight?\nBecause let me tell you,\n\n484\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.110\nhad they not come out with this, and\nreally it wasn't necessarily this.\n\n485\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.420\nBut it was this and Nad, or\npad address translation.\n\n486\n00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.610\nThat ruined our lives.\n\n487\n00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.870\nAnd I say that because IP version\n4 sucks as you're well aware, And\n\n488\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.700\nthe other, and\nit extended the life of IP version four.\n\n489\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.250\nOur world would be a lot better if we were\nat IP version six, it absolutely would be.\n\n490\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.020\nAnd we'll find out so stick around for\nthat later episode so\n\n491\n00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.650\nyou can find out what I'm talking about.\n\n492\n00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.799\nIn the class C it's anything\nthat starts with 192.168.\n\n493\n00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:55.310\nI'm pretty sure that most people\nwatching this probably know this, and\n\n494\n00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.500\nif not you do now.\n\n495\n00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.560\nRC1918, which makes my public address\nrange as the numbers in between,\n\n496\n00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.960\none through nine,\n11 through 126, and so on.\n\n497\n00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.680\nNow, private IP addresses cannot\nbe routed through the Internet.\n\n498\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.880\nThey were a scheme to\nconserve public addresses.\n\n499\n00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.310\nBut as I just mentioned, You can have this\nif you don't have another translation\n\n500\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.620\nprotocol called\nNetwork Address Translation, NAT, right?\n\n501\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.380\nAnd because of NAT,\nwe extended our lives for a long time.\n\n502\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:29.410\nNow that being said,\nlet's go ahead and take a look at,\n\n503\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.640\nI wanna show you guys a couple\nof things before we move on.\n\n504\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.430\nOkay?\n\n505\n00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.800\nFirst off, IP Config is going\nto show me my IP Address.\n\n506\n00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.930\nAll right?\nSo I can see my IP Address,\n\n507\n00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.130\n192168 my default gateway and my mask.\n\n508\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.580\nI don't see my DNS server, though,\nremember that was pretty important because\n\n509\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.130\nBob couldn't talk to Sally\nwithout his DNS server.\n\n510\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.900\nSo I might have to type in something else\nbut before I do, keep an eye right here.\n\n511\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.780\nWhat is this stuff down here?\n\n512\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.180\nWhat is this weird address here,\nlooks like some alien thing.\n\n513\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.550\n>> That looks like an IPV6.\n\n514\n00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.350\n>> It is.\n\n515\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:10.460\nAnd not to jump ahead to far,\nbut what kind of IPV6 is that?\n\n516\n00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.400\nThat's a link local.\n\n517\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.770\n>> Yes, also it's a analogous\nto the IPAP address isn't it.\n\n518\n00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.420\nRight?\nSo we just get that automatically.\n\n519\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.940\nIt helps us communicate.\n\n520\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.070\nSo that's the hop hip of the IPV 6 world.\n\n521\n00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.650\nOkay?\nSo I'm gonna do IPV config, oops,\n\n522\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.100\nspace all and\nthat would get a lot more stuff here.\n\n523\n00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.203\nLet's see where it's at.\n\n524\n00:27:39.373 --> 00:27:40.494\nLots of info here.\n\n525\n00:27:40.494 --> 00:27:42.235\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n526\n00:27:42.235 --> 00:27:43.580\n>> There you go.\n\n527\n00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.500\n>> Here, here, I'm getting there.\n\n528\n00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.290\nThere we go.\n\n529\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.270\nHooo That's some information there.\n\n530\n00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.890\nOkay IPV six, autoconfiguration,\nDHCP, link local.\n\n531\n00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.957\nEven tell us right there to link\nlocal which the of IPV six.\n\n532\n00:27:57.957 --> 00:28:03.140\nMy IPV four address and\nthen here's my DHCP server And\n\n533\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.070\nhere's my DNS servers, right.\n\n534\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:09.450\nSo we can see this with an IP config and\nif I was on a Mac, so if I went over to my\n\n535\n00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:13.090\nMac, which I could do but\nI'm not going to, what would I type in?\n\n536\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.780\n>> For?\n\n537\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.710\n>> For my Mac side or Linux.\n\n538\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.560\n>> It'd be IF.\n\n539\n00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.000\n>> Yep, IF config, If config,\nthat's absolutely right.\n\n540\n00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.540\n>> IF config.\n>> And\n\n541\n00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.890\nthen I'm gonna show you guys one\nmore thing that was important and\n\n542\n00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.970\nI'm showing this cuz\n>> It was on the objectives so\n\n543\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:25.920\nwhen I was looking through,\n\n544\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.980\nI'm I gotta go through this even though\neveryone already probably knows this.\n\n545\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:36.190\nLocal area connection, so this is my\nethernet net card which I guess I'm using.\n\n546\n00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.680\nAnd there's my properties here,\nand I can look.\n\n547\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.430\nLet's take a look at my\nIP4 properties here.\n\n548\n00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.120\nMy gosh, how am I at work and\nI'm plugged in, I'm not using wireless.\n\n549\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.030\nI mentioned I was using wireless\nearlier and I'm not because I'm so\n\n550\n00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.120\nused to it because I'm a DHCP client here.\n\n551\n00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.260\nSo let me test you guys\nfrom the last episode.\n\n552\n00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.210\nNo let's test this guy over here.\n\n553\n00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.100\nWhat happens when my host comes up and\ndoesn't have IPv4 address?\n\n554\n00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.210\nwhat's it gonna do?\n>> It's\n\n555\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.280\ngonna do the discover process to Dora.\n\n556\n00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.530\n>> Yes, go ahead and please elaborate.\n\n557\n00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.430\n>> On Dora?\n\n558\n00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:11.210\nWe of course, the client,\nsends out a discover packet and\n\n559\n00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.900\nthen the server of course gives us an\noffer and then we reply with a request or\n\n560\n00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.980\nif we actually do request-\n>> Yeah we request.\n\n561\n00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.410\n>> And the finally it acknowledges saying\nsure of course you can use that address.\n\n562\n00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.830\n>> Yeah\n>> I never knew watching Dora the Explorer\n\n563\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.505\nwith my grandchild could be so rewarding.\n\n564\n00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:29.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But now we know how the DHP layer,\n\n565\n00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.110\n4 step process works, right?\n\n566\n00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.350\nSo in here then we're going to see,\nwe can add our DNS.\n\n567\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.690\nSome people come in here and add it.\n\n568\n00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.180\nOne of the things you got\nto be careful of, and\n\n569\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.030\nsometimes they do

that.\n\n572\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.440\nAnd they're like you can't resolve names,\nthe DHP sent it out,\n\n573\n00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.640\nand its because someone came in here and\n\n574\n00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.390\nput a static address in here which would\nabsolutely make it stop working, right?\n\n575\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.250\nSo we wanna be aware of\nsomething like that,\n\n576\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:01.320\nwhich is why I went out of\nthe way to show you guys this.\n\n577\n00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.430\n>> All right, well thank you Todd again.\n\n578\n00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.245\nfor actually taking us through\na little bit of the basics of\n\n579\n00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:09.490\nTCP/IP Remember that what we've\nactually taken a look at here.\n\n580\n00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.340\nRight?\nIt was just a brief comparison versus\n\n581\n00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.760\nthe OSI model and that DOD model.\n\n582\n00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.078\nSometimes you also hear\nthe term TCPIP model as well.\n\n583\n00:30:17.078 --> 00:30:21.920\nAnd then Todd also ended taking us\nthrough of course the breakdown here of\n\n584\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.390\nTCP as well as IVP, allowing us to look\nat each of those Header layers and\n\n585\n00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.810\nthe information inside.\n\n586\n00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.560\nFocusing in on the idea here of\nwhat makes reliable traffic and\n\n587\n00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.630\nof course unreliable as well.\n\n588\n00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:38.510\nWe also, of course, talked about the\nmulticast versus broadcast, and unicast,\n\n589\n00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:42.290\nmaking sure that we understood that too,\nand then of course the IP addressing,\n\n590\n00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.710\nmaking sure you understand the How those\nbreak down as far as the classes go,\n\n591\n00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.760\nfocusing in also on the RFC\n1918 addresses, and\n\n592\n00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.310\nthe private IP address range too.\n\n593\n00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.070\nSo all these of course are important\ntopics that you're gonna find that's gonna\n\n594\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.360\nhit you on the exam.\n\n595\n00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.260\nThey may not hit you just\na question on that, but\n\n596\n00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.720\nthese are basic concepts like\nwhat Todd was telling us.\n\n597\n00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.880\nAnd you just have to know if you're gonna\nbe ready to face the exam or in what he\n\n598\n00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.560\nsaid, if you're gonna be in networking,\nyou just have to know these concepts.\n\n599\n00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.850\nSo these are some of those foundations\nthat's really gonna help you\n\n600\n00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.480\nin getting ready for the exam as well as\nfor the rest of your networking career.\n\n601\n00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.430\nBut thank you again,\nTodd, for that reminder.\n\n602\n00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.080\n>> You bet.\n\n603\n00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.600\n>> Thank you also for watching today.\n\n604\n00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.940\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n605\n00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.910\nAnd Todd Langley.\n\n606\n00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.917\n>> Stay tuned right here for more CCENT.\n\n607\n00:31:30.917 --> 00:31:38.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

This skill set according to Todd is indicator of readiness for the ICND1 exam.  He takes us through multiple examples and even some different types of questions that are based on understanding the concept of subnetting. **Errata - at the 46:36 mark, Ronnie incorrectly names 212 as the next number in the sequence. The correct number is 208",

00:00:20.170\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking a look at ICND1.\n\n4\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.670\nWe're specifically going to be\nfocusing on the exam objectives,\n\n5\n00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.380\nand who better to help us than Mr.\nTodd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.340\nThank you for\nbeing in the studios with us today.\n\n7\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.000\n>> Excellent, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.560\nOK, guys.\n\n9\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.220\nWe're going to start having some real fun.\n\n10\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420\nI know we've had some fun so\nfar in the previous episodes, but\n\n11\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.080\nlet's step into subnetting, but I'm going\nto skip the details of subnetting and\n\n12\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.370\nget right into easy subnetting.\n\n13\n00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.970\nDoes that sound good for you guys?\n\n14\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.900\nAll right let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this.\n\n15\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.380\nAll right, so I have done this a lot.\n\n16\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.580\nSo the one thing is I love getting in to\nthis section on my classes or whatever,\n\n17\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.310\nbut when I say you know\nI don't cover binary,\n\n18\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.562\nI don't use binary then\nI show the screen right.\n\n19\n00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:59.360\n[LAUGH] So this is kind of funny, but\nhere's the thing you wanna realize that\n\n20\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.610\nwhy I'm showing you this screen cuz I\nwant you to see this pattern here, right.\n\n21\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.150\nThe pattern is, and the reason if we use\na regular mask, and we can't skip bits.\n\n22\n00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.480\nAnd when we can't skip bits that\nmeans our answers can't change.\n\n23\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.810\nSo, when we get into OSPF and\naccess list, so\n\n24\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.360\nthat we can use inverse mass,\nthen we just get bits.\n\n25\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.620\nThat makes it a little more complicated.\n\n26\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.280\nIn this case here, something that's really\nsimple when you understand that the math\n\n27\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.870\nnever changes, the answers can never\nchange, because we can't skip bits is why.\n\n28\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.180\nSo if we take a look, and\nthis is our subnet mask.\n\n29\n00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.140\nSo if you think about this\nas our subnet mask, and\n\n30\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.810\nfor sake of argument to not stress people\nout, it really doesn't matter here.\n\n31\n00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.220\nBut let's just say I'm in\nthe fourth octet doing a class C,\n\n32\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.665\nthat just helps people feel better.\n\n33\n00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.460\n[LAUGH] So I'm in the fourth octet,\nbut the answers,\n\n34\n00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.530\nwhatever I'm doing here works in\nthe second, third, and fourth octet.\n\n35\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.240\nBut just to not stress and cause extra\nanxiety, which this seems to do,\n\n36\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.310\nwe'll say we're class E, we're only\nworking in the fourth octet, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.410\nKeep it simple.\n\n38\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.190\nSo if I have no bits on in\nmy pseudo fourth octet here.\n\n39\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.337\nThen my decimal value is 0.\n\n40\n00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:08.472\nIt would be 255, 255, 255, 0, right?\n\n41\n00:02:08.472 --> 00:02:13.210\nIf I turn on the first bit,\nthen I have a value of 128.\n\n42\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.620\nSo it would be 255, 255, 255, 128, right?\n\n43\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.130\nSo, the key is that and\nwe look at this, and\n\n44\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.540\nas I turn on bits and don't skip bits,\nthese become my subnet masks.\n\n45\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.330\nSo I have the 128 mask, and we're\ngonna go through what all that means.\n\n46\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.230\nBut I'm just getting you to\nmemorize the masks right now,\n\n47\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.492\nbecause these masks never change,\nthey stay the same forever.\n\n48\n00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:39.150\n[LAUGH] And if I have two bits on,\nbecause I can't skip bits so\n\n49\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.650\nI need more sub bits, so I add more sub\nnit bits which take away the host bits.\n\n50\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.270\nAll right.\n\n51\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.680\nSo I have two bits, 128 and 64 equals 192.\n\n52\n00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.440\n128, 64 and 32 equals 224.\n\n53\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.540\n128 64 is 192, plus 32 is 224,\nplus 16 is 240,\n\n54\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.460\nplus 8 is 248, and this is the 4 bit.\n\n55\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.530\n248 plus 4 is 252.\n\n56\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.640\nNow that's how we get our subnet mask,\nand then we can determine\n\n57\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.640\nour subnets from these, and our\nbroadcasts, and our valid host addresses.\n\n58\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.018\nNow on this case here, for right now,\nsince I told you we were doing a Class E,\n\n59\n00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:26.330\n[COUGH]\nI can only use six subnet masks.\n\n60\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.240\nThe last two maths listed here, I can't\nuse because they only have two host beds\n\n61\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.010\nand if I took that away,\nI mean you have to have two host beds.\n\n62\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.390\nIf I use the last two subnet mask here,\nI would have one host bed and\n\n63\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.280\nzero host beds respectively.\n\n64\n00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.950\nSo the fact is is that I want I'm going to\nonly have six mass that even makes it even\n\n65\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.920\neasier which is another reason people like\nclassy, because there's less to memorize.\n\n66\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.660\nYou only have to memorize six things.\n\n67\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.060\nOkay so let's take this mass that\nwe learned that could never change.\n\n68\n00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.200\nSo remember these numbers forever,\n\n69\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.030\nbecause they can never change\nin IP version four right?\n\n70\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.230\nSo now what do we do with these numbers?\n\n71\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.024\nWell from these numbers we need to get\nthe subnet, the broadcast address, and\n\n72\n00:04:06.024 --> 00:04:08.450\nbetween these two numbers\nis my valid host range.\n\n73\n00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.980\nLet's take a look.\n\n74\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.010\nIn this case here, we want to get\nwhat's called our block size.\n\n75\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.320\nI figured this out in the early to\nmid 90s, how this block size worked.\n\n76\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.700\nIt just came to me, and\n\n77\n00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.100\nthen my whole career kind of\nchanged because of this right here.\n\n78\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.320\nThe reality is my career is where it\nis because of what I figured out here.\n\n79\n00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.200\nBecause then, you're talking about\nthe mid 90s, when no one could subnet.\n\n80\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.450\nAnd not only could I subnet in my head,\nI could do VLSM and\n\n81\n00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.950\nsummarization in my head.\n\n82\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.230\nIt was obviously worth some money.\n\n83\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.505\nBut anyways, so basically I\nfigured out you have 256 numbers,\n\n84\n00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:45.630\nbecause it's 0 to 255, guys.\n\n85\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.370\nThat's 256 numbers.\n\n86\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.430\nSo you take the 256 numbers minus\nthe mask, this is one bit on isn't it?\n\n87\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.020\nAnd then we get something\ncalled our block size.\n\n88\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.520\nNow a block size is important because,\nit's going to tell us our subnets.\n\n89\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.960\nSo I'll count in this\nblock size starting at 0.\n\n90\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.420\nAnd we'll talk about\nwhere we start at zero,\n\n91\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.860\nbut starting at zero all the way\nup to 256 which is invalid.\n\n92\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.610\nBecause that's the last number, right?\n\n93\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.660\nThat's the last incromag coz this is 256,\nright?\n\n94\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.300\nSo if a block size of 128, I start at 0,\nthat'll be my first subnet.\n\n95\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.290\nSo if you guys are confused and someone\nasks you, what's the subnet for this?\n\n96\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.320\nAlways just say zero cuz that's\nalways the first subnet, right?\n\n97\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.280\nSo zero.\n\n98\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.540\nMight not know the second one, but\njust say it with confidence, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.210\nSo what do you think?\n\n100\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.040\nWhat's my first subnet?\n\n101\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.610\n>> Zero.\n[LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.000\n>> Okay, that was somewhat confident.\n\n103\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.700\nWe're gonna work on his confidence.\n\n104\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.150\nZero plus the block size\nis 128 is my next subnet.\n\n105\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.570\nAnd then I take that subnet plus\nthe block size to get my next subnet,\n\n106\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.740\n128 plus 128 is 256,\nwhich we know is not a subnet.\n\n107\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.470\nBut we count and tell,\nbecause we know we are done.\n\n108\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.560\nSo if I am in the first subnet of zero.\n\n109\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.780\nMy next subnet is 128, I need to know in\n\n110\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.510\nthe zero subnet what the broadcast address\nis so that I don't assign it to a host.\n\n111\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.380\nI can't.\n\n112\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.590\nThe zero's reserved, the subnet number.\n\n113\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.000\nSo all host bits off.\n\n114\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.540\nAnd the broadcast adder's reserved\nwhich is all host bits on.\n\n115\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.200\nAll the numbers in between are out.\n\n116\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.340\nSo how do I get my broadcast address?\n\n117\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.560\nThe answer is simple.\n\n118\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.910\nIt was always the number\nright before the next subnet.\n\n119\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.380\nSo I was like, ding.\n\n120\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.630\nSo this was why I needed no math.\n\n121\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.180\nWhenever I did math it came\nout the same every time.\n\n122\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.200\nThe number right before the next\nsubnet in this example is 127.\n\n123\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.590\nMy valid hosts were always the numbers\nin-between the network address and\n\n124\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.050\nbroadcast address,\ndoing my math, 1 through 126.\n\n125\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.856\nSo, now I have a subnet.\n\n126\n00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:41.267\nAnd, we'll just say it's class-C to keep\nit simple, so you guys don't stress out.\n\n127\n00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.820\n192.168.10.0 here's my subnet.\n\n128\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.420\nMy valid host range is 1 to 126.\n\n129\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.650\nAnd everyone has to put in the same mask,\n\n130\n00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.840\n255, 255, 255,128 on every host\nthat uses this subnet, right?\n\n131\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.630\nNow so\nwe have another subnet that we can use.\n\n132\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.920\nThat's the 128.\n\n133\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.876\nThe next increment of 128 is 256,\nwe wrote that down here.\n\n134\n00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:09.943\nAnd the number right before that is what?\n\n135\n00:07:09.943 --> 00:07:11.034\n>> 255.\n\n136\n00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:16.490\n>> My valid host center, 129 to 254.\n\n137\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.189\nOkay, so now I have two subnets.\n\n138\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.370\nWhat should we do with these?\n\n139\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.720\nWe're gonna find that out.\n\n140\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.160\nNow, to get your subnets\ndoesn't mean very much,\n\n141\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.224\nif you can't determine what\nyour valid host range is.\n\n142\n00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:32.500\nYour subnet number,\nthen you find the next subnet,\n\n143\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.190\nthe number right before that\nis your broadcast address.\n\n144\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.980\nThe numbers now in between\nyour subnet number and\n\n145\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.950\nyour broadcast address is\nyour valid host range.\n\n146\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.852\nOkay, so, the next one, I'm gonna, when I\nsqueeze this it gets rid of my writing, so\n\n147\n00:07:46.852 --> 00:07:50.476\nnow I can do this again, so\nit might look funny on the screen, but\n\n148\n00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:53.187\nthat's how I can figure\nout how to delete this.\n\n149\n00:07:53.187 --> 00:07:57.660\nAnyways, my next subnet mask is a 192,\n\n150\n00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:04.017\n192 mask With a block size,\n256 minus 192 is 64.\n\n151\n00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.386\nWhat are my subnets?\n\n152\n00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:05.886\nWhat are my subnets?\n\n153\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.870\n>> First one is zero.\n\n154\n00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.790\n>> Zero with confidence.\n\n155\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.290\nOkay, you go ahead and\ncount by increasing to me block size,\n\n156\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.670\nthis is what you have to do.\n\n157\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.530\nSo determining your block size one thing,\nmemorizing that and then you count your\n\n158\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.790\nblock size, without screwing up, and\nthen you'll have your answers, right?\n\n159\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.400\nSo as long as you know what\nyour block size are is and\n\n160\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.440\nyou can count on that,\nyou're gonna be fine.\n\n161\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.190\nZero\n>> 64, 128, 192.\n\n162\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.700\n>> That's right,\n256 would have been the next one.\n\n163\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.290\nSo, if I'm in the zero subnet,\nand the next subnet is 64,\n\n164\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.380\nwhich makes my broadcast address\nsubnet zero, sub net what?\n\n165\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.220\n>> 63.\n\n166\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.350\n>> That's right, my valid host then for\nthe zero subnet are 162.\n\n167\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.880\nDo you see how easy this is?\n\n168\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.500\nIf you went to another class,\nthen they're gonna sit there and\n\n169\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.190\ngo, well did you do your one's and\nzero's and then you and and or, really?\n\n170\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.050\nReally, come on guys.\n\n171\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.020\nAnyways, counting in your increments\nof block sizes, you have your answer.\n\n172\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.960\nAnd eventually,\nit doesn't take very long, a week or\n\n173\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.730\ntwo of practice and you'll be doing\nthis in your head in no time.\n\n174\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.270\nAnd by the way, for you to do your say,\n\n175\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.800\nseason exam, if you can't subnet\nin your head, you'll never pass.\n\n176\n00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.630\nI can't figure out all\nthese other Cisco courses,\n\n177\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.730\nwhere they have new and or uses to write\nthat down and pass your test, forget it.\n\n178\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.260\nIt's not gonna happen guys.\n\n179\n00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.870\nAll right zero 64 is the next subnet,\nwhat's the broadcast of the 64 subnet?\n\n180\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.440\n>> 127\n>> Right, because the next subnet is 128.\n\n181\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.260\nI think, what's so\nfunny if you guys ever come to my class.\n\n182\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.340\nTypically, I have this, something like\nthis on the board behind me asking\n\n183\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.340\nquestions and every questions, I asked\nthe answer is on the board behind me.\n\n184\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:46.100\nSo when we're asking you guys a question\nout there you guys should be answering me.\n\n185\n00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.500\nThe answers on the board.\n\n186\n00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.340\n65 to 126 is my valid\nhost of my second subnet.\n\n187\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.680\nOn my third subnet, it's 128 and\nthe subnet after that is 192.\n\n188\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.134\nThat makes the 128 subnet\nbroadcast address 191.\n\n189\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.030\nValid host 129 to 190.\n\n190\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:10.240\nAnd then, 192 is my next one and\nthen 256 is my next increment,\n\n191\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.270\nso that be 255 here, so\n193 to 254, is that right?\n\n192\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:20.120\n>> Yep.\n>> Okay, I always have to check my math,\n\n193\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.295\nI do this so much, I don't pay attention.\n\n194\n00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:28.860\n[LAUGH] So, All right,\n224 mask, block size?\n\n195\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.890\n>> 32\n>> Now, you might doing cost a, b or c,\n\n196\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.490\nI told you c but I changed it in\nmy mind that we were doing b and\n\n197\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.785\nyou didn't even know it, why?\n\n198\n00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:40.570\n'Cuz the answers are the same, whether you\ndo an a, b or c that's what makes this\n\n199\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.585\nmethod so awesome, once you figure\nout you see a mask your block size\n\n200\n00:10:44.585 --> 00:10:47.570\nthe answers are always the same,\nwhether doing a class a, b or c.\n\n201\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.610\nThere is a slightly different way that\nwe figure out, but it is easy right, and\n\n202\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.612\nwe are going to do that in the next\nstep the next part of this episode.\n\n203\n00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.992\nAll right, we will get into class a and b.\n\n204\n00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:59.910\nAll right now, 224 block size of 32,\nI won't count all these out and\n\n205\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.593\nthen we will, zero.\n\n206\n00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.920\n[LAUGH] Zero, zero.\n\n207\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.230\n>> Dude, I gave away your first subhead.\n\n208\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.430\n>> Zero, zero.\n>> Okay, you go ahead and\n\n209\n00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.200\ncount it all out.\n\n210\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.310\n>> Zero thirty two.\n\n211\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:13.260\n64, that'd be 96 then 128,\n\n212\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.646\n160, 192, 224.\n\n213\n00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:19.907\n>> 224, 286, yes.\n\n214\n00:11:19.907 --> 00:11:21.161\nSo, we have eight subnets.\n\n215\n00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:24.524\nI knew that I was done because we\nhad four subnets in the mass before,\n\n216\n00:11:24.524 --> 00:11:26.471\nwe have eight now, it keeps doubling,\n\n217\n00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:29.729\nevery time we add a bit we double\nthe amount of subnets that we get.\n\n218\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.320\nI won't go through all these,\nbut if I was in the zero subnet,\n\n219\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.960\nwhat do you guys think that my\nbroadcast address would be?\n\n220\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.390\n>> 31.\n>> Yeah, now, but\n\n221\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.480\nyou didn't use any binary.\n\n222\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.160\n>> I did not.\n>> Are you sure you're right?\n\n223\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.340\n>> I'm pretty sure, I'm right.\n\n224\n00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.120\n>> Pretty sure.\n\n225\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.190\nI'm pretty sure you're right too,\n\n226\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.110\nbecause if you were to do this in binary\nthese are the answers you'd come out with.\n\n227\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.770\nExcept, we'll get through this whole\nsection before you guys can do one thing\n\n228\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.391\nwith binary.\n\n229\n00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:52.948\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> 32, the next subnet's 64,\n\n230\n00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:55.272\nmakes my broadcast 63, 33 to 62.\n\n231\n00:11:55.272 --> 00:11:58.610\nNow wait,\ngot something special to show you.\n\n232\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.460\nI'm not gonna go through all these, right?\n\n233\n00:12:04.522 --> 00:12:05.320\nGet rid of that.\n\n234\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.250\nI'm not gonna go through every single one,\ncuz it's all done the same way.\n\n235\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.690\nIt's just different sized blocks.\n\n236\n00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.100\nBut I wanna, I want to show you something.\n\n237\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.500\nLook at this here, this 128.\n\n238\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.300\nThe next subnet is 160.\n\n239\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.490\nWe just wanna broadcast that as 159.\n\n240\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.200\n129 to 190, right?\n\n241\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.750\nOkay, that's not that exciting.\n\n242\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.340\nThat's just another subnet.\n\n243\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.730\nWhat I want you guys to understand is,\nthere is one subnet that is in every mask.\n\n244\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.040\nFrom the 128 all the way to the 252.\n\n245\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.789\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n246\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.380\nThere's one subnet in every single mask\nand that is for 128 pass, the 128 subnet.\n\n247\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:41.920\nAll right, so whenever your subnetting,\nso 96 the next subnet's 128,\n\n248\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.670\n127's my broadcast, whenever your\nsubnetting, it doesn't matter\n\n249\n00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:50.010\nwhat subnet mask you're using, 128's\na subnet and 127's always a broadcast.\n\n250\n00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.030\nAlways.\n\n251\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.090\nNow, if you're not subnetting that's not\ntrue but if you're subnetting in any way,\n\n252\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.010\n128 is always a subnet and\n127 is always a broadcast address.\n\n253\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.010\nEasy to remember.\n\n254\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.880\nNow, why is this important?\n\n255\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.190\nBecause when I, in a few minutes I'm going\nto ask you guys some subnet questions that\n\n256\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.350\nare out past 150 and\n200 is a host address.\n\n257\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.760\nSo, instead of starting at zero,\nwe can start at 128 and count from there.\n\n258\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.280\nThat's a really good nice point.\n\n259\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.970\nThat being said,\nnow we've got the next one.\n\n260\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.960\n240 is the one where people struggle,\nand this is the one Cisco picks on.\n\n261\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.510\nWhy can't I get my thing done?\n\n262\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.570\nThere we go.\n\n263\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.040\nCisco picks on this one.\n\n264\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.640\nWhy?\nBecause Cisco knows that\n\n265\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.958\nyou can't count by 16.\n\n266\n00:13:27.958 -->

yet.\n\n269\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.050\nThey are, when they leave though,\ncuz they wanna pass their exams, so\n\n270\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.590\nthey can count by 16s.\n\n271\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.380\nAll right.\n\n272\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.789\nNow that being said, so\nI'm here in the 240 mask.\n\n273\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.580\nWe have to know our 240 mask,\nboth in class a, b and c,\n\n274\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.760\n12 slash 12 slash 20 slash 28.\n\n275\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.580\nWe'll get to that.\n\n276\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.210\nOkay, this is a block size of 16.\n\n277\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.720\nSo let's count by 16's and\nwe'll do it together, Ronnie.\n\n278\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.220\nHow's that sound?\n\n279\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.443\nReady with confidence.\n\n280\n00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:02.714\n[CROSSTALK] 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80.\n\n281\n00:14:02.714 --> 00:14:09.043\n96, 112, 128,\nthere's that infamous 128, right?\n\n282\n00:14:09.043 --> 00:14:15.866\nBroadcast 127 for\nthe 112 subnet, 144, 160, 176,\n\n283\n00:14:15.866 --> 00:14:21.080\n192, 208, 224 and absolutely, 240.\n\n284\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.000\nThat's 16 subnets that I wrote down there.\n\n285\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.820\nAnd now, I need to know my broadcast\ncenter, so I can get my valid host.\n\n286\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.460\nWell, it's pretty simple.\n\n287\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.950\nI'll do the 112.\n120 is my next subnet.\n\n288\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.320\n127 is a broadcast address.\n\n289\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.260\n128.\n143 is a broadcast address valid host.\n\n290\n00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.985\n113 to 126.\n\n291\n00:14:37.985 --> 00:14:43.330\n129, 142 pretty simple guys,\npretty simple.\n\n292\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.246\nAll right, let me see if I can make this,\nwhy is it fighting me today?\n\n293\n00:14:47.246 --> 00:14:52.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Might be an easier way to that out.\n\n294\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.990\n248 mask block size 8.\n\n295\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.700\nNow, I think we can count by eights.\n\n296\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.130\nI'm just gonna assume that you can so\n[INAUDIBLE], so does Cisco.\n\n297\n00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.450\n08, 16.\nIf I was at the 8 subnet the next sub\n\n298\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.859\nis 15 so my broadcast is 15.\n\n299\n00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:11.600\n9, 14 is my valid hosts.\n\n300\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.460\nVery few hosts, lot more subnets.\n\n301\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.340\nThen the 16, the next subnet's what?\n\n302\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:22.620\n24, so my broadcast is 23 17\nto 22 are my valid hosts.\n\n303\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.200\nIt's all done the same way,\nwhat's the difference, between the masks?\n\n304\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.170\nJust the amount of hosts,\njust the block size, that's it.\n\n305\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.680\nRight?\nAnd one last mask,\n\n306\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.110\nis the 252 mask here and\n\n307\n00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.560\nthe 252 mask used quite a bit and because\nwe have, we'll take a look at this here.\n\n308\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:47.233\nBlock size of 4, so\nmy subnet are 4 0 4 8 and 12 and so on.\n\n309\n00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:51.616\nIf I was in the 4 subnet, zero subnet,\nlet's do that, 3 is my broadcast,\n\n310\n00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:55.470\nvalid hosts are 1 and 2 but\nin the 4 subnet, my next subnet is 8.\n\n311\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:00.299\nSo, I put a 7 down here as\na broadcast address, valid host 5 and\n\n312\n00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:02.813\n6 I think everyone can see this.\n\n313\n00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:03.636\nHow many hosts is this?\n\n314\n00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:06.590\nThis is only two hosts.\n\n315\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.290\nWhy would we use something with two hosts?\n\n316\n00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:12.299\nI think Cisco would like that if you\nbought router hosts type of thing, right?\n\n317\n00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:14.644\nI think you know a lot\nof router ports there.\n\n318\n00:16:14.644 --> 00:16:21.427\nSo 8, 12, you've got 11, as our broadcast\naddress, 9 and 10 is my valid host.\n\n319\n00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:25.612\nSo we'd see this on something if I have\na serial WAN, it doesn't have to be, but\n\n320\n00:16:25.612 --> 00:16:29.380\nif I had a serial WAN I'd only\nhave two hosts, .9 and .10, right?\n\n321\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.600\nThis is the subnet 8,\nbroadcast equals 11, right?\n\n322\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.350\nSo that's in the 8 subnet here.\n\n323\n00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.566\nThat's when we use something like this,\nand why would we do this?\n\n324\n00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:40.029\nTo save address space.\n\n325\n00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:43.465\nThat's when we get to VLSM in the next\nsection, in the next episode.\n\n326\n00:16:43.465 --> 00:16:45.392\n254 mask block size of two.\n\n327\n00:16:45.392 --> 00:16:46.871\nCan only do that with Class A and B,\n\n328\n00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:50.720\ncan't do that with Class C cuz they need\nat least two host bits all the time.\n\n329\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.930\nAnd this one is a 285,\n\n330\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.030\nwe'll see this a lot with class B,\npeople use this is a block size of one.\n\n331\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.420\nSo, these get a little bit\neasier as block size of one and\n\n332\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.130\ntwo cuz I think we can count in those,\nright?\n\n333\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.525\nNow, IP addressing as we talked\nabout it in last section,\n\n334\n00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:09.615\nis 32 bits broken up into dotted decimal.\n\n335\n00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:11.436\nRight, eight bits each.\n\n336\n00:17:11.436 --> 00:17:17.885\nSo our lowest is 0.0.0.0,\nour highest is 255.255.255.255, right?\n\n337\n00:17:17.885 --> 00:17:24.205\nAnd so we'll see our addresses in four\nbytes broken up into dotted decimal.\n\n338\n00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:28.420\nNow, as we talked about in the last\nepisode we have a network and\n\n339\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.750\nthen host for each class of address.\n\n340\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.710\nClass A has more hosts.\n\n341\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.170\nClass B has, what Cisco considers\nan equal amount of networks and\n\n342\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.270\nequal amount of hosts.\n\n343\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.150\nAnd a Class C has more networks and\nvery few hosts on each network.\n\n344\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.750\nClass D is multicast.\n\n345\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.520\nSo, Ronnie,\nlet's do a review from last episode guys.\n\n346\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.315\nLet's test this guy out.\n\n347\n00:17:48.315 --> 00:17:49.474\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ronnie,\n\n348\n00:17:49.474 --> 00:17:51.194\nwhat's my network range with class A?\n\n349\n00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:52.437\nHow do I know if it's a class A address?\n\n350\n00:17:52.437 --> 00:17:54.620\nIf I look at it,\nwhat tells me it's Class A?\n\n351\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.530\n>> Well when you tend to look at it in\nthe binary should begin with a zero.\n\n352\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.668\n>> Begins with a zero.\n\n353\n00:17:58.668 --> 00:17:59.934\nGood, Ronnie.\n\n354\n00:17:59.934 --> 00:18:02.908\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the decimal value for Class A?\n\n355\n00:18:02.908 --> 00:18:05.648\n>> The decimal value\nshould be 1 through 126.\n\n356\n00:18:05.648 --> 00:18:07.239\n>> Well is he right, guys?\n\n357\n00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:08.621\nIs he right, anybody out there?\n\n358\n00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:11.220\nHe is right, okay, ding, ding, ding.\n\n359\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.620\nAll right, Class B, Ronnie.\n\n360\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.610\nGive me the binary and decimal equivalent.\n\n361\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.748\n>> Binary should be beginning with 1, 0.\n\n362\n00:18:17.748 --> 00:18:20.825\n>> 1,\n0 in the first byte is absolutely correct.\n\n363\n00:18:20.825 --> 00:18:23.287\nAnd the decimal equivalent.\n\n364\n00:18:23.287 --> 00:18:27.187\n>> Should be 129, no.\n\n365\n00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:28.105\nYep, no.\n\n366\n00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:29.800\n>> It's on the board.\n\n367\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.903\n>> 128.\n\n368\n00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:32.365\n>> 128 [LAUGH] What is it?\n\n369\n00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.561\n>> Through 191.\n\n370\n00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:35.744\n>> 191, I don't know why I said 129.\n\n371\n00:18:35.744 --> 00:18:37.072\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It was my head.\n\n372\n00:18:37.072 --> 00:18:37.955\n>> It's okay Ron.\n\n373\n00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:40.451\n>> And in the Class C,\nwhat's the bits that we use.\n\n374\n00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:41.832\n>> It should be 110.\n\n375\n00:18:41.832 --> 00:18:42.912\n>> It is 110.\n\n376\n00:18:42.912 --> 00:18:45.292\nAnd my decimal equivalent?\n\n377\n00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:47.254\n>> Should begin with 191?\n\n378\n00:18:47.254 --> 00:18:49.378\nNo 192 through 223.\n\n379\n00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:50.575\n>> Good.\n\n380\n00:18:50.575 --> 00:18:53.390\nAll right so that's how we know for\nrunning class A, B or C.\n\n381\n00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.422\nNow Ronnie do you remember\nwhat class D started with?\n\n382\n00:18:56.422 --> 00:18:57.966\n>> It starts with 224.\n\n383\n00:18:57.966 --> 00:18:59.068\n>> It does.\n\n384\n00:18:59.068 --> 00:19:00.660\nAnd that goes to 239.\n\n385\n00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.746\nAnd the wasted addresses,\ncouple billion here, that's all.\n\n386\n00:19:04.746 --> 00:19:08.710\nSo 285 are wasted in reserve,\nall right, [LAUGH].\n\n387\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.140\nSo we waste a lot of addresses\nin IP version 4 guys, okay.\n\n388\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.260\nI know we went over that in the last\nepisode if you watched it, and\n\n389\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.080\nthe reason I put it in here is because\na lot of people aren't going to watch\n\n390\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.752\nthat episode or maybe they skipped it.\n\n391\n00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:22.810\nOr it's just important for\nyou to know so I mention it twice and\n\n392\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.750\nagain those are the bits.\n\n393\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.290\nSo remember our subnet mass\nClass A default, Class B?\n\n394\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.800\nNow why do we remember this?\n\n395\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.905\nThe 285 means all ones mean my network\nbits, now I can start subnetting here.\n\n396\n00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:36.130\nI'll start subnetting with Class B\nhere and Class C here, right?\n\n397\n00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.770\nSo this is why it's important.\n\n398\n00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.430\nWe can tell whether it's class A, B or\n\n399\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.070\nC so we know which bits we\ncan start subnetting with.\n\n400\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.270\nNow we have to start with the first bit\nand then move right without skipping bits.\n\n401\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.100\nThat was our key, right,\nto understanding this.\n\n402\n00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.190\nSo as we add subnet bits,\nwe take host bits away so\n\n403\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.490\nwe have less host per sum then,\nwhich is okay with me.\n\n404\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:03.200\nClassless Internet domain routing,\nright, allows us to hand out blocks to,\n\n405\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.970\nyou know this was really just created so\n\n406\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.680\nISPs can hand out blocks of hosts to\ncompanies so we don't waste addresses.\n\n407\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.452\nInstead of giving them a whole Class A or\nClass B or Class C.\n\n408\n00:20:12.452 --> 00:20:15.620\nNow I don't list every\nslash notation here but\n\n409\n00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.730\nwhat we're working with with\nthe Class C right now in this episode.\n\n410\n00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:25.930\nA /8 means, this means how many bits\nout of 32 are turned on in the mask?\n\n411\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.720\nAre.\n\n412\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.578\nThis has 30, this is 8.\n\n413\n00:20:28.578 --> 00:20:30.135\nSo, this is a /8.\n\n414\n00:20:30.135 --> 00:20:32.479\n8, 16.\n\n415\n00:20:32.479 --> 00:20:35.629\n8, 16, 24.\n\n416\n00:20:35.629 --> 00:20:38.576\n8, 16, 24, and 1.\n\n417\n00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:41.220\nSo I did skip all these in here,\nthese masks.\n\n418\n00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.750\nThat's fine, we'll come back to those.\n\n419\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.600\nBut you need to memorize this and\nthen we'll come back and\n\n420\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.360\nmemorize the Class A and B.\n\n421\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.610\nBut in this case here,\nyou have to now what a slash 25 is.\n\n422\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.877\nSo if said to you,\n\n423\n00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:57.795\nwhat's your broadcast address in the first\nsubnet with a Class C with a slash 25?\n\n424\n00:20:57.795 --> 00:20:59.316\nAnd the answer is 127.\n\n425\n00:20:59.316 --> 00:21:00.250\nHow do I know that?\n\n426\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.825\nBecause I know that a slash 25\nis a 128 in the fourth octet,\n\n427\n00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:05.510\nand that's got a block size of 128.\n\n428\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.710\nMy subnets are 0 and 128.\n\n429\n00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.140\nFrom the zero subnet,\nthe next subnet's 128.\n\n430\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.998\nMy broadcast address must be 127.\n\n431\n00:21:11.998 --> 00:21:16.037\nThese are the kind of things that you have\nto know walking in that CCENT exam, and\n\n432\n00:21:16.037 --> 00:21:18.840\nuntil you know that don't walk in there,\nokay.\n\n433\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.343\nSo /25 128 mask in the fourth octet,\n\n434\n00:21:23.343 --> 00:21:28.353\n/26 is two bits on so 8, 16, 24 and 2.\n\n435\n00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:29.096\nIt's not 26.\n\n436\n00:21:29.096 --> 00:21:31.058\nA 192 mask is a block size of what?\n\n437\n00:21:31.058 --> 00:21:31.733\n>> 64.\n\n438\n00:21:31.733 --> 00:21:33.138\n>> 64.\n\n439\n00:21:33.138 --> 00:21:36.970\nSo in the /25 my subnets are 0 and 128.\n\n440\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.910\nBroadcast of 0, subnet is 127, right.\n\n441\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.156\nNow in the /26, let me make this\nsmaller so I can write more.\n\n442\n00:21:44.156 --> 00:21:51.354\n0, what was it 64, 128, 192.\n\n443\n00:21:51.354 --> 00:21:55.442\nOkay and the /27 here now,\nso 224 mask, 224 mask, so\n\n444\n00:21:55.442 --> 00:22:00.458\nI have to know this has a mask or a slash\nnotation or take the mask and turn it into\n\n445\n00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:05.490\na slash notation or the slash notation\ninto a mask and into a block size.\n\n446\n00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.835\nEither way you have to\nknow this inside out.\n\n447\n00:22:07.835 --> 00:22:10.563\nSlash 27 is a 224 mask\nwith a block size of?\n\n448\n00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:11.248\n>> 32.\n\n449\n00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:12.432\n>> 32 is correct.\n\n450\n00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:15.475\nAnd my subnets for the 32 are what?\n\n451\n00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:22.434\n>> 0, 32, 64, 96, 128.\n\n452\n00:22:22.434 --> 00:22:26.253\n>> 128, 160, 192.\n\n453\n00:22:26.253 --> 00:22:28.040\n>> Oops, [CROSSTALK] 224,\n\n454\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.932\niPad whenever I hit the corner\nit switches my screen there.\n\n455\n00:22:31.932 --> 00:22:33.990\nOkay so I'm kinda writing those down.\n\n456\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.410\nYou guys have to be able to do this so\nkeep practicing this.\n\n457\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.270\nI'll keep going over this.\n\n458\n00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.730\nWe're not done yet\nguys with this section either, all right.\n\n459\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:46.600\nAnyways /28 Cisco's favorite Class C mask,\nlet me tell you, all right.\n\n460\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.790\nSo here's what we're gonna do.\n\n461\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.630\nI'm gonna come over here\nto this screen here and\n\n462\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.378\nRonnie here's gonna be our\nspokesmodel here, right?\n\n463\n00:22:54.378 --> 00:22:59.852\nOn the 16s and you follow along with him\nwhile I'm over here laughing at him.\n\n464\n00:22:59.852 --> 00:23:02.560\nAll right, the first one I'll give to him\nbecause I have a lot of confidence in\n\n465\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.450\nthis first subnet of 0.\n\n466\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.180\n>> 0.\n>> What do you guys think?\n\n467\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:05.943\nSure Todd you're right.\n\n468\n00:23:05.943 --> 00:23:07.244\n>>

to\nit once I'm a CCENT and I have nothing\n\n488\n00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:59.187\nelse to do, maybe I'm retired sitting on\na beach with a With umbrella in my drink.\n\n489\n00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:00.767\nThen I'll get around to counting my 16's.\n\n490\n00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:02.162\nYou're not gonna get to the beach and\n\n491\n00:24:02.162 --> 00:24:04.999\nhave an umbrella in your drink unless\nyou can count by 16's, all right.\n\n492\n00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:05.556\nSo let's do this.\n\n493\n00:24:05.556 --> 00:24:07.982\n0, 16, 32, 48, 64.\n\n494\n00:24:07.982 -->

--> 00:24:30.401\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> 224\n\n511\n00:24:30.401 --> 00:24:31.109\n>> And one more.\n\n512\n00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:35.254\n>> And then that's going to be 240 itself.\n\n513\n00:24:35.254 --> 00:24:35.997\n>> Yep, that's the mask.\n\n514\n00:24:35.997 --> 00:24:40.090\nZero, 240, now if I'm in the zero subnet,\nthe next subnet is 16.\n\n515\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.997\nSo my broadcast is 15,\nvalid host, one two 14.\n\n516\n00:24:42.997 --> 00:24:45.030\nI think we got that part down, but\n\n517\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.330\nyou gotta be able to count by\n16s to be able to do this.\n\n518\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.020\nWhen I see a slash 28, and we're gonna\nget to a slash 20 shortly, hang in there.\n\n519\n00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.495\nSlash 28, you're gonna say this.\n\n520\n00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:57.517\nWhenever I say slash 28,\nyou're gonna go 0, 16, 32, 48, 64.\n\n521\n00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:58.469\nDo it in the shower.\n\n522\n00:24:58.469 --> 00:24:59.723\nDo it while you're walking.\n\n523\n00:24:59.723 --> 00:25:01.025\nGo for a jog.\n\n524\n00:25:01.025 --> 00:25:01.773\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n525\n00:25:01.773 --> 00:25:05.819\nmost of us that are watching this,\nprobably aren't gonna go for a jog.\n\n526\n00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:09.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But 64 nothing I'm gonna say whether it\n\n527\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.100\nlooks like out there but we're all\nthe same place here, come on guys.\n\n528\n00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.330\nAnyways, 240 mask.\n\n529\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.250\n>> What?\n>> Give me the valid host of broadcast\n\n530\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.400\naddress for the 240 mask.\n\n531\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.190\n>> The 240, 255.\n\n532\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.343\n>> 255, yes.\n\n533\n00:25:25.343 --> 00:25:26.640\n>> Would be the broadcast, sorry.\n\n534\n00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.940\n>> So you're looking at 241.\n\n535\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.570\n>> Through

like,\nall this confidence, I say what sub is it?\n\n546\n00:25:46.525 --> 00:25:47.805\nHe goes, zero!\n\n547\n00:25:47.805 --> 00:25:49.095\nRight, I know that for a fact.\n\n548\n00:25:49.095 --> 00:25:52.625\nIt's true because this command is on.\n\n549\n00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:55.794\nBy default, I think it started\neleven something t on this.\n\n550\n00:25:55.794 --> 00:26:00.653\nLet's go [INAUDIBLE] the late\n90's maybe early 2000s, anyways,\n\n551\n00:26:00.653 --> 00:26:04.877\nIP sub net zero,\nthis guys running version 12-2 here but,\n\n552\n00:26:04.877 --> 00:26:07.757\nthe key is guys,\nwhy am I showing you this?\n\n553\n00:26:07.757 --> 00:26:14.332\nBecause you're gonna get questions\nthat Cisco says something like this,\n\n554\n00:26:14.332 --> 00:26:19.653\nyou have a slash 29 network,\nwhat is the broadcast address\n\n555\n00:26:19.653 --> 00:26:24.275\nof the fourth subnet and\nsubnet zero is not enabled?\n\n556\n00:26:24.275 --> 00:26:25.995\nWhat's Ronnie gonna do now?\n\n557\n00:26:25.995 --> 00:26:27.155\nWhat's his first subnet?\n\n558\n00:26:27.155 --> 00:26:28.405\nRonnie?\n\n559\n00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:30.255\nOkay?\nLet me say it again.\n\n560\n00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.340\nRonnie's gonna have to answer this.\n\n561\n00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.650\nSlash 29, you should know the mask.\n\n562\n00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.680\nYou should know the lock size.\n\n563\n00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.270\nAll right?\n\n564\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.550\nSo now the fourth subnet.\n\n565\n00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.750\nSubnet zero's not an enabled.\n\n566\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.570\nThat's what the question is.\n\n567\n00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.990\nSo what's your broadcast address Ronnie?\n\n568\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.610\n>> The broadcast address,\nfor the first one, would be.\n\n569\n00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.520\n>> Fourth, fourth subnet.\n\n570\n00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.134\n>> Fourth

have to go to the next 7 to get my\nbroadcast adverse cuz we're in 32 subnet.\n\n585\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.060\nNext one is 40 so the answer was 39.\n\n586\n00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.630\nOkay, so not a hard one but\nyou see how it can get you twisted up?\n\n587\n00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.520\nAnd when you're under pressure with\na test it makes it even harder.\n\n588\n00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.180\nJust cuz he's on film here, no pressure.\n\n589\n00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.240\n>> No pressure.\n\n590\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.910\n>> Thousands and\nmillion of people watching,\n\n591\n00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.380\nthere are millions of people watching,\nright?\n\n592\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.252\n>> Yeah, and I got it wrong [LAUGH].\n\n593\n00:27:41.252 --> 00:27:44.180\n>> [LAUGH] All right, now,\nhere's the other thing,\n\n594\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.500\nI wanna show you something, all right?\n\n595\n00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.260\nNot gonna see this anywhere else, promise,\nwell, unless you come to my class.\n\n596\n00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.780\nNow that being said,\ncheck this out, I have two routers.\n\n597\n00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:55.790\nLet me do it this way.\n\n598\n00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.750\nThat's kind of a cool thing isn't it.\n\n599\n00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.150\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay, so I go and\n\n600\n00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.480\nI put this address on,\n\n601\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.580\nhere you guys are going Ronnie's\nnot going to give you the answer.\n\n602\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.795\nI want someone to text me this.\n\n603\n00:28:05.795 --> 00:28:08.107\n[LAUGH] And I type this in, IP address,\n\n604\n00:28:08.107 --> 00:28:11.085\nI'm going to put the address\non this interface.\n\n605\n00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:18.080\nI say IP address 192.168.10.62\n255.255.255.192.\n\n606\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.904\nI press Enter, nothing, so\n\n607\n00:28:20.904 --> 00:28:26.460\nthat means good,\n\n608\n00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.160\nno news is good news when you're\ntyping in a command on a router.\n\n609\n00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.160\nBut I come to this one here,\nand I type in this,\n\n610\n00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:44.379\nIP address 192 168 10.61\n\n611\n00:28:44.379 --> 00:28:49.430\nand the same mask, which is a slash 26.\n\n612\n00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.000\nNow, just, I put in shorthand here.\n\n613\n00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.400\nYou cannot type in slash 26 on a router.\n\n614\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.100\nAll right?\n\n615\n00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.100\nYou have to type out the mask.\n\n616\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.160\nI'm just lazy.\n\n617\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.830\nAll right.\n\n618\n00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.100\nBut it comes back and\nit does give you something.\n\n619\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.570\nIt says this, bad mask.\n\n620\n00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.130\nWell, remember,\nI didn't type in /26 in the router.\n\n621\n00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.180\nI'm just showing you that.\n\n622\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.263\nI typed in 285 285 285 192\nWhy would this one work and\n\n623\n00:29:12.263 --> 00:29:14.462\nthis one up here give me a bad mask?\n\n624\n00:29:14.462 --> 00:29:16.064\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n625\n00:29:16.064 --> 00:29:24.380\n{BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND] [LAUGH] All right.\n\n626\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.774\nOkay, actually the first time I saw this,\n\n627\n00:29:26.774 --> 00:29:31.298\nit took me about five seconds which is an\nenormous amount of time for me to subnet,\n\n628\n00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:34.110\nbecause I can do it without\nthinking whatsoever.\n\n629\n00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.750\nOnly because I do it every day, but\n\n630\n00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:40.150\nthe fact is is I had to say\nit our loud before I got it.\n\n631\n00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.720\nI came here and I said 192.168.10.62.\n\n632\n00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.190\n192 mass blocks size of\n64 is in the zero subnet.\n\n633\n00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.890\nBroadcast, he's in the zero subnet.\n\n634\n00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:49.780\nThat's what I said.\n\n635\n00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.880\nIt's got to have something\nto do with the zero subnet.\n\n636\n00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.570\nAnd I looked up here, it said 61.\n\n637\n00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.060\nThat's a valid host.\n\n638\n00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.900\nI bet you this doesn't\nhave IP subnet zero on.\n\n639\n00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:06.480\nSo I came here, and it said,\nin the config no IP subnet zero.\n\n640\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.860\nWhen you get that bad mask and\nyou're typing it in,\n\n641\n00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.560\nverify what subnet you're in.\n\n642\n00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.150\nSay it out loud!\n\n643\n00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.221\nAs soon as I said,\nit's in the subnet zero [INAUDIBLE].\n\n644\n00:30:14.221 --> 00:30:15.270\nIt immediately hit me.\n\n645\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.070\nIt's a subnet zero issue.\n\n646\n00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.150\nIt can be.\n\n647\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.550\nIt shouldn't be.\n\n648\n00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.170\nRight?\n\n649\n00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.550\nAll routers have subnet zero enabled.\n\n650\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.090\nRight?\n\n651\n00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.435\nBut it doesn't mean it won't be.\n\n652\n00:30:24.435 --> 00:30:26.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now you guys know the answer.\n\n653\n00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.540\nYou won't find that answer anywhere else.\n\n654\n00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.470\nWell, in my book and\nin my class but, all right.\n\n655\n00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.560\nYou guys, I'm tired of easy sub-netting.\n\n656\n00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.220\nIt's too hard.\n\n657\n00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.810\nLet's do very easy sub-netting,\nwhat do you say, okay?\n\n658\n00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.660\nNow, I don't really,\nthis is all the math that you would get\n\n659\n00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.560\nkind of in another class, so\nI kinda skip all this stuff.\n\n660\n00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.150\nAnd we'll cross it out so you can see it.\n\n661\n00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.640\nBut the fact is, is I'm just gonna come\nup here, I see what network I'm in.\n\n662\n00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.320\nIn 128, so once we get this done,\n\n663\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.160\nyou're gonna be able to\nanswer questions like this.\n\n664\n00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.757\n[SOUND] [SOUND] If I have a 128 mass,\nfirst off this is a slash what?\n\n665\n00:30:57.757 --> 00:31:02.390\nThis mass is a slash what?\n\n666\n00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.840\n>> 25.\n>> Thank you Ronnie, slash 25.\n\n667\n00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.750\nMy subnets with a slash 25 are zero and\n128.\n\n668\n00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.070\nBlock size of 128, 0.128.256.\n\n669\n00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.600\nFinding the 0 subnet my broadcast\nafter this must be 127.\n\n670\n00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.150\nAll right, still 127 as a broadcast in\na matter of the minute on sub-netting and\n\n671\n00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.540\n128 is always the subnet the minute\non sub-netting, all right?\n\n672\n00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.270\nAnd if I'm in the 0 subnet,\nmy valid host are 1.2.1.2 26.\n\n673\n00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:29.410\nThere is no reason to go through all\nthis other Math that I have on here;\n\n674\n00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.850\nyou might do it through other classes or\nother books or at University,\n\n675\n00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.320\nwherever you're studying.\n\n676\n00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:34.890\nForget it!\n\n677\n00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.640\nYou don't want to do all that binary,\nyou don't have time!\n\n678\n00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.080\nSo in this case here, 0.128,\nnow hold on a second,\n\n679\n00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.340\nthe reason I'm showing you this screen is.\n\n680\n00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.390\nThis is all great and good, and\n\n681\n00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.310\nyou can subnet everyday until\nthe cows come home, whatever.\n\n682\n00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.350\nI don't even know what that means.\n\n683\n00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.743\nWhen do the cows come home?\n\n684\n00:31:52.743 --> 00:31:57.094\nAnyways, [LAUGH] what do\nyou do with these subnets?\n\n685\n00:31:57.094 --> 00:31:59.834\nThat's the question du jour.\n\n686\n00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:02.990\nSo I wanna know,\nwhat should I do with these subnets.\n\n687\n00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.860\nWhat do you think Ronnie?\n\n688\n00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.660\n>> We should create smaller\nnetworks out of them.\n\n689\n00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.300\n>> Okay, with what kind of device,\nyou think?\n\n690\n00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.360\nA hub?\n\n691\n00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.200\n>> No, not a hub.\n\n692\n00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.060\nIt would be on a.\n\n693\n00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.750\n>> Switch?\n\n694\n00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.610\n>> Switch, router?\n\n695\n00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.580\n>> Well,\n>> Well.\n\n696\n00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.540\n>> Router.\n>> More of a router, yes.\n\n697\n00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.040\nMore of a router, but now implement.\n\n698\n00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.510\nNow, remember, he wasn't necessarily\nwrong when he said the switch but\n\n699\n00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.310\nhe probably should have said layer\nthree switch or enterprise switch.\n\n700\n00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.070\nThat's really the technical\nanswer isn't it?\n\n701\n00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.750\nSo we want to be careful,\nwe just say switch.\n\n702\n00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.940\nRemember, if Cisco says\nswitch on this exam,\n\n703\n00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.760\nthey're referring to a layer two device,\nso be careful.\n\n704\n00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.080\nAll right, now implement it.\n\n705\n00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.130\nSo, look at what I did here, guys.\n\n706\n00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.410\nThere's my zero subnet.\n\n707\n00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.510\nHere's my 128.\n\n708\n00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.660\nSo, I went in here and\n\n709\n00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:48.200\nsaid, on this interface here,\nwhich is Ethernet 0 and Ethernet 1.\n\n710\n00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.110\nNow, I use Ethernet 0 and\nEthernet 1 as examples in my CCNA.\n\n711\n00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.410\nIt's just a generic Ethernet interface.\n\n712\n00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.180\nAnywhere from 10 megabits to 10 gigabits,\nright?\n\n713\n00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.475\nSo, of course in the iOS, we typically\ndon't get 10 gigs, but on the Nexus we do.\n\n714\n00:33:02.475 --> 00:33:05.830\n10 and 40 gigs and stuff.\n\n715\n00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.688\nAnyways, so I came in here and\nsaid 192.168.10.1\n\n716\n00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:15.166\n255.255.255.128 right because we\nhave a block size of 128, right?\n\n717\n00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:16.640\nSo we're slash 25.\n\n718\n00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.300\nI put that in there and the router\nimmediately injected that network\n\n719\n00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.895\ninto the routing table in sub c\nwhich means directly connected,\n\n720\n00:33:25.895 --> 00:33:28.550\n192.168.10.0 is directly\nconnected to Ethernet 0.\n\n721\n00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.170\nSo, the routing table\nwhich is listed here,\n\n722\n00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.940\nimmediately put it's\ndirectly connected network.\n\n723\n00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:39.120\nSo, now when IP comes over here and says,\nhey send this to 192.168.10, the host.\n\n724\n00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.870\nIP parses this routing table, looks at the\nrouting table and finds the x interface.\n\n725\n00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.390\nThen packet switches it, we're a switch.\n\n726\n00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:48.630\nWe're a layer three switch.\n\n727\n00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.730\nPacket switches it over to the x\ninterface based on the routing table.\n\n728\n00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.780\nRight, that's how we use that.\n\n729\n00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.060\nAnd we'll get into that\nmore than you now maybe.\n\n730\n00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.730\nAnyways, the next one I came over and\nsaid 192.168, 10.129 25 25 25 128.\n\n731\n00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.300\nImmediately put that network\ninto the routing table.\n\n732\n00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.730\nBut wait.\nThe interphase have\n\n733\n00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.040\nto be enabled don't forget, or\nyou won't see them in there.\n\n734\n00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:13.530\nAnd notice, let me ask a question.\n\n735\n00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.230\nCan this host over here communicate\nto this host over here,\n\n736\n00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.190\nbased on this network draw?\n\n737\n00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.020\nAnd the answer is absolutely it can.\n\n738\n00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.220\nBut you're like I don't have RIP,\n\n739\n00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.730\nit doesn't matter,\nall my networks are directly connected.\n\n740\n00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.660\nThe reason you'd want a routing\nprotocol like RIP, OSPF or RGP or\n\n741\n00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.280\nwhatever cuz I have remote\nnetworks off other routers.\n\n742\n00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.460\nI don't have that here so they're\ndirectly connected, everyone can talk.\n\n743\n00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.299\nThis network would\nautomatically start working.\n\n744\n00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.840\nBecause we're running\nCisco routers of course.\n\n745\n00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.980\nAll right, [LAUGH] let's do it again.\n\n746\n00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:45.064\nCisco would like it that I said that,\n\n747\n00:34:45.064 --> 00:34:47.240\nI usually am very disparaging\nabout these guys.\n\n748\n00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.130\nAll right, 255.255.255.192,\nthis is a slash what, guys?\n\n749\n00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.700\nSlash what?\n>> 26.\n\n750\n00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.440\n>> 26, absolutely.\n\n751\n00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.609\nWith a block size of?\n\n752\n00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:01.275\nSlash 26 is a 192 mass\nwith a block size of 64.\n\n753\n00:35:01.275 --> 00:35:04.521\n0, 64, 128 and 192.\n\n754\n00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:08.063\nIf I am in the zero subnet,\nand the next subnet is 64,\n\n755\n00:35:08.063 --> 00:35:11.530\nthen the broadcast address for\nthe 0 subnet is 63.\n\n756\n00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.983\nValid hosts is between 1 to 62.\n\n757\n00:35:13.983 --> 00:35:15.081\nAll right,\nwe are going to do this the same way.\n\n758\n00:35:15.081 --> 00:35:17.450\nNext subnet is 64, and\nthe next subnet after that it is 128.\n\n759\n00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.200\nI don't even need to look to know\nmy broadcast addresses is 127.\n\n760\n00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.144\nRight.\n65 to 126 and so on, right.\n\n761\n00:35:25.144 --> 00:35:28.330\nSo this gives us 4 subnets,\neach with 62 hosts.\n\n762\n00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.890\nNow what should I do with these 4 subnets,\nI wonder?\n\n763\n00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.210\n>> Again, create more networks.\n\n764\n00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.850\n>> With a hub, a repeater?\n\n765\n00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.130\n>> A wireless access point?\n\n766\n00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.710\n>> Nope, an actual router.\n\n767\n00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.010\n>> A router or a?\n\n768\n00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:39.760\n>> A layer 3 switch.\n\n769\n00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.290\n>> Enterprise switch, thank you.\n\n770\n00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.612\nHe's getting there, he's getting there.\n\n771\n00:35:42.612 --> 00:35:43.451\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's gonna say\n\n772\n00:35:43.451 --> 00:35:44.670\nthe right thing next time.\n\n773\n00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.990\nNow, so notice we're gonna\nimplement this in a larger network.\n\n774\n00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.450\nNow, in this example,\nI have how many broadcast domains?\n\n775\n00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.910\nWell, I have three router interfaces,\nso I have three broadcast domains.\n\n776\n00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.615\nI can see them in my routing table.\n\n777\n00:35:56.615 --> 00:35:57.142\nRight?\n\n778\n00:35:57.142 --> 00:36:02.483\nSo I put 192.168, the 0 network here,\nthe 64 network here,\n\n779\n00:36:02.483 --> 00:36:06.230\n128, I even have an extra one here,\ndon't I?\n\n780\n00:36:08.746 --> 00:36:13.291\nSo that I didn't use, but we'll see them\nhere 0, 64, 128, Ethernet 0, 1 and 2.\n\n781\n00:36:19.732 --> 00:36:23.830\nOkay, 192.68.10.0, this is the slash what?\n\n782\n00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.980\n>> 27.\n\n783\n00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.190\n>> Okay.\n\n784\n00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.910\nSo my block.\n\n785\n00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:36.290\nIt's slash 27,\nit is a 224 mast with a block size of.\n\n786\n00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:37.216\n>> 30\n>> 32.\n\n787\n00:36:37.216 --> 00:36:39.348\n>> 32 [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n788\n00:36:39.348 --> 00:36:40.329\nZero.\nRemember,\n\n789\n00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:43.240\nalways count 0 unless told otherwise,\nright?\n\n790\n00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.177\nSo let's just say,\nmaybe like that question I just gave you,\n\n791\n00:36:46.177 --> 00:36:47.890\nsubnet 0 is not enabled.\n\n792\n00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.296\nIf they don't say that, always start at 0.\n\n793\n00:36:49.296 --> 00:36:53.573\nAll right, 0, 32, 64, 96, 128.\n\n794\n00:36:53.573 --> 00:36:57.038\nIf I'm in the 96 subnet,\nmy broadcast is 127.\n\n795\n00:36:57.038 --> 00:36:58.450\nValid those 97 to 126.\n\n796\n00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.730\nRight, I think we got this now.\n\n797\n00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.870\nThey're all done the same way.\n\n798\n00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.840\nWe just have different blocks of hosts.\n\n799\n00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.440\nThe more subnet bits we have,\nthe less host bits that we have.\n\n800\n00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.910\nSo now I can implement\nan even bigger network.\n\n801\n00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:16.230\nBut here's the problem and\nwe're gonna get to this one in the two\n\n802\n00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:21.740\nepisodes from now about VLS sound,\nbecause how many hosts does this give me?\n\n803\n00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.200\nHow many host does this,\nwe're at a slash 27, right?\n\n804\n00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.740\nYep, how many hosts does this give me?\n\n805\n00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.620\n>> 30.\n>> That's right.\n\n806\n00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.270\nBlock size of 32.\n\n807\n00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.940\nThe amount of host per network or\nsubnet is\n\n808\n00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.510\nalways two less cuz you minus the network\nand the broadcast address, right?\n\n809\n00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.910\nAbout hosting numbers in between.\n\n810\n00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:42.897\nSo my subnets are 0, 32, 62, 96 right?\n\n811\n00:37:42.897 --> 00:37:44.497\nAnd so in this case here,\n\n812\n00:37:44.497 --> 00:37:49.550\nhow many hosts do I have between\nthis point to point network here?\n\n813\n00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:51.270\nHow many hosts do I have available there,\nRonnie?\n\n814\n00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.730\n>> You should still have 30.\n\n815\n00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.010\n>> I have 30 still, yeah, 30.\n\n816\n00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.660\nHe's absolutely right.\n\n817\n00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:00.780\nSo the fact is this is called classful,\n\n818\n00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.460\nrouting which means that everyone\nuses the same subnet mask.\n\n819\n00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.840\nI doubt you'll see that on the exam.\n\n820\n00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.060\nWe're gonna use something called, and\nwe'll get to that two episodes from now,\n\n821\n00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.740\nclassless, which means that\nI can use a different mask.\n\n822\n00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.370\nSo what do you guys think?\n\n823\n00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:17.410\nIf I was using classless,\nI wouldn't use the same mask in here,\n\n824\n00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.850\nwhat mask would you think you would\nuse on a point to point connection?\n\n825\n00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.810\nWhat do you think?\n\n826\n00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:26.450\n>> 30.\n>> Slash 30 which gives me two Os.\n\n827\n00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.710\nDoes it make my network run better?\n\n828\n00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.310\nNo.\n\n829\n00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.930\nDoes it save address space?\n\n830\n00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:31.310\nYes, that's all it does.\n\n831\n00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:35.210\nSo let's everyone just use a class\nA address, so we run out of addresses and\n\n832\n00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.060\nhave to got IP version 6, what do you say?\n\n833\n00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.850\nLet's not save address space.\n\n834\n00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:45.550\nAll right, the 240 mask, should we\nhave Ronnie count by 16s again guys?\n\n835\n00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.020\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n836\n00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.810\n>> He says no.\n\n837\n00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.360\n240 mask, so a block size of 16.\n\n838\n00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.763\nWe have 16 subnets, each with 14 hosts.\n\n839\n00:38:53.763 --> 00:39:00.002\n0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80,\n96, 112, and so on, okay?\n\n840\n00:39:00.002 --> 00:39:03.918\nIf I'm in the 0 subnet,\nthe next subnet is 16, so\n\n841\n00:39:03.918 --> 00:39:07.936\nmy broadcast is 15,\ndial the host 1 through 14.\n\n842\n00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.490\nThat was a slash what, I didn't even ask.\n\n843\n00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.770\nThis is a slash what?\n\n844\n00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.630\n>> 28.\n>> Slash 28.\n\n845\n00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.970\nPlease remember your slash notations.\n\n846\n00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:20.880\nOkay, this is a slash what?\n\n847\n00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.380\n>> 29.\n>> 29.\n\n848\n00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.468\nBlock size?\n\n849\n00:39:22.468 --> 00:39:23.200\n>> 8.\n\n850\n00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:23.934\n>> 8.\n\n851\n00:39:23.934 --> 00:39:25.687\n0, 8, 16, 24.\n\n852\n00:39:25.687 --> 00:39:26.873\nIf I'm in a zero subnet,\n\n853\n00:39:26.873 --> 00:39:30.730\nthe next subnet's safe and I will write\nfor that as 7 with our host 1 through 6.\n\n854\n00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.990\nAll right, so we have 6 hosts.\n\n855\n00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.205\n32 subnets, each with 6 hosts.\n\n856\n00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.230\nAll right, I did wanna ask something\nwhile I'm back here on the 240\n\n857\n00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.940\nmask for a second.\n\n858\n00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.618\nActually, no I'm gonna wait\ntill we get to class B.\n\n859\n00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:49.218\nNow, this mask here\nthe last one in class C, so\n\n860\n00:39:49.218 --> 00:39:52.050\nour last one before we get to\nthe very easy sub name section.\n\n861\n00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.372\nThis was just a precursor war mop.\n\n862\n00:39:54.372 --> 00:39:57.832\n252 is a slash what?\n\n863\n00:39:57.832 --> 00:39:58.412\n30.\n\n864\n00:39:58.412 --> 00:40:00.153\n>> With a block size of?\n\n865\n00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:01.431\n>> 4.\n>> 4.\n\n866\n00:40:01.431 --> 00:40:05.580\nSo my subnets are 0, 4, 8,\n12, 16, whatever, right?\n\n867\n00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.630\nIf I'm in the 12th subnet,\nwhat is my broadcast address?\n\n868\n00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.774\nWell, the next subnet is 16, isn't it?\n\n869\n00:40:12.774 --> 00:40:13.428\n>> 15.\n\n870\n00:40:13.428 --> 00:40:15.950\n>> 15 valid host 13, 14.\n\n871\n00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:20.860\nIf I'm in the 8th subnet,\nthen I might go to host 9 or\n\n872\n00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.950\n10, my broadcast is 11.\n\n873\n00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:28.860\nPretty simple, and we would use this on,\nso is something like this like we\n\n874\n00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.350\nhave an example here of, all right,\na point to point, right?.\n\n875\n00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.220\nAll right, nine and ten.\n\n876\n00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.190\nThis is the 12th subnet, so\nwe have valid host 13 and 14.\n\n877\n00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.370\nThis mask, I don't know if it works well.\n\n878\n00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.980\nThat's what Cisco says, it works well.\n\n879\n00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.600\nI don't know about working any better, but\nit certainly saves address space better.\n\n880\n00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.400\nNow, all right guys, I know I mentioned\nabout getting into the very early,\n\n881\n00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.440\neasy subname earlier, but let's do it now.\n\n882\n00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.006\nI want you guys out there to tell me\nwhat the subnet broadcast address and\n\n883\n00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:01.743\nvalid host range of these two hosts are.\n\n884\n00:41:01.743 --> 00:41:03.657\nReady, set, [SOUND] go.\n\n885\n00:41:06.652 --> 00:41:10.570\nIf we could, yes, David,\nokay, I got a question on it.\n\n886\n00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:16.490\nThere is, David, there is absolutely\na /31 but not on the CCNA objectives.\n\n887\n00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.530\nAll right, so they don't consider that\nvalid, but in real life you can use a /31.\n\n888\n00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.830\nBut I'm not gonna cover it on this video,\nbecause it's not in the objectives.\n\n889\n00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:24.780\nThank you, David.\n\n890\n00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.437\nAll right, David,\ndo you happen to have an answer for\n\n891\n00:41:27.437 --> 00:41:29.279\nwhat subnet [LAUGH] these guys are in?\n\n892\n00:41:29.279 --> 00:41:30.232\nAnybody out there?\n\n893\n00:41:30.232 --> 00:41:32.252\nIf not, I'm going to have to\npick on Ronnie over here, guys.\n\n894\n00:41:32.252 --> 00:41:38.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, he's not answering.\n\n895\n00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.860\nSo, Ronnie, you're on board here.\n\n896\n00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.000\n>> All right, so\nthe first one is in the zero subnet.\n\n897\n00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.840\n>> That's right, because first off, for\n\n898\n00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.290\nRonnie to get to that point,\nhe had to know what a /25 is.\n\n899\n00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:54.722\nA /25 is a 128 mask, and\nmy subnets are 0 and 128.\n\n900\n00:41:54.722 --> 00:41:57.010\nIf he didn't know that,\nhe couldn't answer this question.\n\n901\n00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.600\nSo he knew that this 68 fell\nright here between 0 and 128.\n\n902\n00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.570\nSo Ronnie,\nwhat's your broadcast address, then?\n\n903\n00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.380\n>> Should be 127.\n\n904\n00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.110\n>> That is correct.\n\n905\n00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.500\nValid host then would be 1 through 126.\n\n906\n00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.541\nAll right, now the next one Ronnie,\nsame thing.\n\n907\n00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:14.440\nIt's out of 168, though.\n\n908\n00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:19.567\n>> Should be on the 128 network, and\nthe broadcast then would be on the 255.\n\n909\n00:42:19.567 --> 00:42:21.000\n>> 255, that's correct.\n\n910\n00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.410\nHe's in the 128 subnet,\nthe next increment of 128 is 286.\n\n911\n00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.250\nSo, my broadcast address is 285,\n\n912\n00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:33.390\n129 to 254 is my valid host range and\nthis guy falls in it.\n\n913\n00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.570\nSo, this guy is in the 0 subnet and\nthis guy is in the 128 subnet.\n\n914\n00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.890\nOkay, let's try another one\n>> You have three of them here Ronnie.\n\n915\n00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:44.970\n>> Nice.\n\n916\n00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:50.343\n>> Anybody out there can jump in here and\nhelp Ronnie out at any time.\n\n917\n00:42:50.343 --> 00:42:50.910\nGo ahead, Ronnie.\n\n918\n00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.601\n>> On the /27, that would be 224.\n\n919\n00:42:57.601 --> 00:43:00.838\nSo we would have a block space of 32.\n\n920\n00:43:00.838 --> 00:43:06.203\nSo, 32 64, the first one there would\nactually be in the 64 network so\n\n921\n00:43:06.203 --> 00:43:08.160\nthe-\n>> That's right.\n\n922\n00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:13.870\n>> The broadcast then would be in the 95.\n\n923\n00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:14.780\n>> That's right.\n\n924\n00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.870\nSo let's recap what he just did.\n\n925\n00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:20.009\nSo the first thing he did\nis he took a /27, and\n\n926\n00:43:20.009 --> 00:43:24.421\nsaid that's a 224 mask and\nthat's a block size of 32, okay?\n\n927\n00:43:24.421 --> 00:43:26.160\nHe had to know that part.\n\n928\n00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.445\nOnce you do that, you can just count\nby your increments of your block size.\n\n929\n00:43:29.445 --> 00:43:33.323\nSo, he just went 0, 32, 64.\n\n930\n00:43:33.323 --> 00:43:37.355\nNow we might know that 65 is in the 64\nsubnet, but we have to go one more so\n\n931\n00:43:37.355 --> 00:43:40.168\nwe can then determine\nour broadcast address.\n\n932\n00:43:40.168 --> 00:43:46.200\nSo, 96, our broadcast address then is 95,\nvalid host 65 to 94, okay.\n\n933\n00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:52.890\nThe next one Ronnie,\nnow this is where that 128\n\n934\n00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.200\nsubnet clue that I gave you would\ngonna come in handy, isn't it Ronnie?\n\n935\n00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.710\n>> It really is,\nbecause if it's a block 32 size and\n\n936\n00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:05.014\nthat next network should be 160\n>> So then after that,\n\n937\n00:44:05.014 --> 00:44:10.572\nthat should be 191,\nis gonna be our broadcast.\n\n938\n00:44:10.572 --> 00:44:11.687\n>> Boy, that's a mess, isn't it?\n\n939\n00:44:11.687 --> 00:44:12.894\n>> Yep.\n\n940\n00:44:12.894 --> 00:44:15.076\n>> [LAUGH] That says 160 there, guys.\n\n941\n00:44:15.076 --> 00:44:20.557\n128 160 192, so we started at 128 there,\nwe didn't have to start at 0.\n\n942\n00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:22.066\nSo, 120 160.\n\n943\n00:44:22.066 --> 00:44:25.385\nObviously, we're in that, but that we\nhave to go to the next subnet to get our\n\n944\n00:44:25.385 --> 00:44:27.445\nbroadcast address which\nis going to be 191.\n\n945\n00:44:27.445 --> 00:44:32.321\nThat host 161 to 190.\n\n946\n00:44:32.321 --> 00:44:33.940\nOkay, the last one.\n\n947\n00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.120\nNow, here's another clue.\n\n948\n00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.050\nWho said you can't start at 256 and\ngo backwards?\n\n949\n00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:38.650\nSo that's what I'll do.\n\n950\n00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:42.620\nLet me do this.\nSo I'm going to go 256, I'll start here,\n\n951\n00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.620\nminus 32.\n\n952\n00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.110\nIt's 224.\n\n953\n00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.070\nMinus 32 is 192, ding, ding, ding.\n\n954\n00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.750\nSo in this case here,\nwe started at 128, went up.\n\n955\n00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:55.230\nIn this case here, I started at\nthe very last, 256, and went down.\n\n956\n00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.830\nAnd I'm in the 192 subnet, and\nthen my broadcast becomes 223.\n\n957\n00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.780\n193 to 222.\n\n958\n00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.240\nBadda bing, badda boom.\n\n959\n00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.040\nRight?\n\n960\n00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.770\nSo, you've got to, this is\nthe thing that drives people crazy.\n\n961\n00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.030\nFor your c set, you've got to be able\nto count subnets forwards, backwards,\n\n962\n00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.020\nfrom the middle, you know, whatever,\nyou've gotta do it in all ways.\n\n963\n00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.210\nBut if you know the block size, and\n\n964\n00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.120\nyou know if you see a slash\nnotation what the mask is, and\n\n965\n00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.180\nyou can count in increments of\nthat block size, you can't miss.\n\n966\n00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.540\nYou will score.\n\n967\n00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.627\n>> All right, okay,\nwe've got another one, woo hoo.\n\n968\n00:45:24.627 --> 00:45:26.276\nThis is going to be the fun one guys.\n\n969\n00:45:26.276 --> 00:45:28.459\nCan he do it?\n\n970\n00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:34.390\nSo it's a /28, which is a-\n>> 240 subnet.\n\n971\n00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:41.560\nAnd so the first one would be 32,\n48, 47, would be the subnet mask.\n\n972\n00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.730\n>> Wait, say this again.\n\n973\n00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.238\nA /20, slow down a little bit.\n\n974\n00:45:47.238 --> 00:45:48.631\n>> 28, 240.\n\n975\n00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:52.323\n>> A /28 guys, is a 240 mask,\nwith a block size of what?\n\n976\n00:45:52.323 --> 00:45:52.834\n>> 16.\n\n977\n00:45:52.834 --> 00:45:53.760\n>> 16.\n\n978\n00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.520\nGuys, that's your first\ntwo critical questions.\n\n979\n00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.560\nA /28 is a 240 mass with\na block size of 16.\n\n980\n00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.790\nDo you have to really count by 16s?\n\n981\n00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:04.080\nI already told you that you did, so yes.\n\n982\n00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.610\nShould we do it again guys?\n\n983\n00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:06.210\nWhat do you say?\n\n984\n00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.426\nCome on, let's help Ronnie out here.\n\n985\n00:46:09.426 --> 00:46:10.640\nAll right, here we go Ronnie,\n\n986\n00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.326\nI'll give you the first one because\nI know that's the hardest one.\n\n987\n00:46:13.326 --> 00:46:14.482\n>> 0, 16.\n>> 0.\n\n988\n00:46:14.482 --> 00:46:18.990\n>> 32, 48,\n\n989\n00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:24.729\n64\n>> 80, 96, 112,\n\n990\n00:46:24.729 --> 00:46:29.808\n128, 144, 160,\n\n991\n00:46:29.808 --> 00:46:34.897\n176, 192, 212?\n\n992\n00:46:34.897 --> 00:46:36.185\n>> You're right.\nI was counting by 16.\n\n993\n00:46:36.185 --> 00:46:38.467\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No you're right, it was me,\n\n994\n00:46:38.467 --> 00:46:39.137\nI was on 32s.\n\n995\n00:46:39.137 --> 00:46:40.507\n212s.\n\n996\n00:46:40.507 --> 00:46:41.714\n224, 240.\n\n997\n00:46:41.714 --> 00:46:42.852\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n998\n00:46:42.852 --> 00:46:46.032\nI get halfway up by 16s, and\nI start counting by 32s.\n\n999\n00:46:46.032 --> 00:46:46.567\nYeah.\n\n1000\n00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:49.305\nSo that's part of how\nyou can get in trouble.\n\n1001\n00:46:49.305 --> 00:46:53.192\nYou start counting it with a 16,\nor a /28 or /29.\n\n1002\n00:46:53.192 --> 00:46:54.111\nYou start counting high,\n\n1003\n00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.125\nyou start counting in different\nblock size by accident.\n\n1004\n00:46:56.125 --> 00:46:57.045\nSo we want to be careful there.\n\n1005\n00:46:57.045 --> 00:47:01.410\nRight, that being said, guys,\nnow we have the answers here.\n\n1006\n00:47:03.345 --> 00:47:07.024\nOkay?\n240 mass block, size 16/28, 240 mass 38,\n\n1007\n00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:11.700\ndo I need to go through all that\nagain to know I'm in the 32 sub net?\n\n1008\n00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.045\nAnd the next sub net is 48, so\nmy broadcast address is 47.\n\n1009\n00:47:16.045 --> 00:47:18.528\nValid host 33 to 46.\n\n1010\n00:47:18.528 --> 00:47:25.263\nThe 138, now I know is going to be in the\n128 subnet, the next subnet after that is?\n\n1011\n00:47:25.263 --> 00:47:26.247\n>> 144.\n\n1012\n00:47:26.247 --> 00:47:30.729\n>> So my broadcast must be 1433,\n129 to 142.\n\n1013\n00:47:30.729 --> 00:47:34.657\nAnd the 238, I don't know,\nlet's count backwards!\n\n1014\n00:47:34.657 --> 00:47:39.254\n256, 240, 224.\n\n1015\n00:47:39.254 --> 00:47:46.429\nSo 224, the next one's 240 so\nmy broadcast address is 239, 225 to 238.\n\n1016\n00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:51.236\nGot to be able to do this,\nthis is a have to.\n\n1017\n00:47:51.236 --> 00:47:52.500\nThis one's pretty easy, Ronnie.\n\n1018\n00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.288\nKnock this one out of the park for me.\n\n1019\n00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:59.259\n/29,

128.\n\n1032\n00:48:31.597 --> 00:48:36.130\nSo my broadcast is 127,\nvalid host, 121 to 126.\n\n1033\n00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.615\nAnd lastly.\n\n1034\n00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:39.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>>

00:49:51.540\n192.168.23.61/28 is what mask?\n\n1062\n00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:57.520\nIt's a 240 mask in the fourth octet,\nso block size of 16,\n\n1063\n00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.705\n0, 32, 48, 64, I'm in the 48 subnet.\n\n1064\n00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.743\nNext one's 64, so 63's my broadcast.\n\n1065\n00:50:04.743 --> 00:50:07.704\n49 to 62 is my valid host.\n\n1066\n00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:08.668\nOkay, that's how you do it.\n\n1067\n00:50:08.668 --> 00:50:10.189\nThat's how you have to do it.\n\n1068\n00:50:10.189 --> 00:50:14.007\nOkay, a small company has\na Class C network address and\n\n1069\n00:50:14.007 --> 00:50:19.050\nneeds to create five subnets,\neach accommodating 25 hosts.\n\n1070\n00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.560\nWhich subnet mask needs to be configured?\n\n1071\n00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.755\nIt's actually a pretty\nrelatively simple question.\n\n1072\n00:50:26.755 --> 00:50:28.205\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you guys wanna look for\n\n1073\n00:50:28.205 --> 00:50:30.850\nis the amount of hosts and\nget your block size.\n\n1074\n00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:32.197\nSo how many hosts do you have?\n\n1075\n00:50:32.197 --> 00:50:33.857\n>> 25.\n\n1076\n00:50:33.857 --> 00:50:36.295\n>> Which means you need a block size of?\n\n1077\n00:50:36.295 --> 00:50:36.886\n>> 30.\n\n1078\n00:50:36.886 --> 00:50:38.245\n>> 32.\n\n1079\n00:50:38.245 --> 00:50:39.581\nWhich is a mask of?\n\n1080\n00:50:39.581 --> 00:50:40.382\n>> 224.\n\n1081\n00:50:40.382 --> 00:50:42.321\n>> 224, there's your answer.\n\n1082\n00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:43.284\nThat's it.\n\n1083\n00:50:43.284 --> 00:50:47.984\nJust look for the amount of hosts,\nadd it to your block size, get your host.\n\n1084\n00:50:47.984 --> 00:50:53.707\nWhat is the subnet of 192.168.1.42,\nthat's a slash, 29.\n\n1085\n00:50:53.707 --> 00:50:54.705\nI don't wanna read out the mask.\n\n1086\n00:50:54.705 --> 00:50:56.226\nI'm lazy that way.\n\n1087\n00:50:56.226 --> 00:50:57.352\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n1088\n00:50:57.352 --> 00:50:58.804\nWhat sum is this host in?\n\n1089\n00:50:58.804 --> 00:51:00.243\n>> 40.\n\n1090\n00:51:00.243 --> 00:51:03.471\n>> Yeah, 40 broadcast is what?\n\n1091\n00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:05.445\n47, 48.\n\n1092\n00:51:05.445 --> 00:51:06.350\n>> 47, yup.\n\n1093\n00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:08.370\n>> So right there, and it's a /29.\n\n1094\n00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:09.368\nWe have to know that.\n\n1095\n00:51:11.794 --> 00:51:15.675\nAdministrator is working with\nthe 192.168.4.0 network,\n\n1096\n00:51:15.675 --> 00:51:18.139\nwhich has been subnetted with a /26 mask.\n\n1097\n00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.970\nOkay, this is a good question.\n\n1098\n00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:21.920\nBe careful here.\n\n1099\n00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.390\nRead this carefully.\n\n1100\n00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:27.180\nWhich two addresses can be assigned\nto host within the same subnet?\n\n1101\n00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.390\nSo now you gotta know your block sizes.\n\n1102\n00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.130\nWhich two hosts listed here\nare in the same subnet?\n\n1103\n00:51:40.675 --> 00:51:42.789\nActually, there's a few that\nare in the same subnet, but\n\n1104\n00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:43.790\nwhich two can be assigned?\n\n1105\n00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:44.780\nLet me read it carefully.\n\n1106\n00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.978\nWhich two addresses can be assigned\nto hosts within the same subnet?\n\n1107\n00:51:52.415 --> 00:51:59.473\n>> [LAUGH] 67 and 125.\n\n1108\n00:51:59.473 --> 00:52:00.693\n>> I believe he's right.\n\n1109\n00:52:00.693 --> 00:52:04.416\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the problem with this guy here is,\n\n1110\n00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:10.440\nit's a /26, so\nour subnets are 0, 64, 128, 192.\n\n1111\n00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.000\nThese guys both might be in the 0 subnet,\nbut this is a broadcast address.\n\n1112\n00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:19.306\nAnd the answer I guess, what can be\nassigned, that makes this answer wrong.\n\n1113\n00:52:19.306 --> 00:52:22.394\n128 and 132, this guy is a subnet.\n\n1114\n00:52:22.394 --> 00:52:24.646\n128's always a subnet.\n\n1115\n00:52:24.646 --> 00:52:25.993\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right?\n\n1116\n00:52:25.993 --> 00:52:31.049\nSo 65 and 64, right,\nbecause 127 is my broadcast.\n\n1117\n00:52:31.049 --> 00:52:33.824\n65 to 126.\n\n1118\n00:52:33.824 --> 00:52:38.690\nOkay, so the answer is 67 and 125.\n\n1119\n00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:40.000\nNice.\n\n1120\n00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.191\nThought I had, right.\n\n1121\n00:52:43.191 --> 00:52:47.285\nWe gotta go into our next session, so\nthat'll do it for our Class Cs, guys.\n\n1122\n00:52:47.285 --> 00:52:50.392\n[SOUND] Hey, how do you feel?\n\n1123\n00:52:50.392 --> 00:52:51.217\nAwesome, Todd.\n\n1124\n00:52:51.217 --> 00:52:52.366\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's great!\n\n1125\n00:52:52.366 --> 00:52:54.200\n>> [LAUGH] That's great.\n\n1126\n00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.244\nGlad to hear it.\n\n1127\n00:52:55.244 --> 00:52:56.069\nWhat about you, Ronnie?\n\n1128\n00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.892\nHow are you feeling?\n\n1129\n00:52:56.892 --> 00:52:58.727\n>> I'm feeling challenged, now.\n\n1130\n00:52:58.727 --> 00:52:59.727\n>> Good.\n\n1131\n00:52:59.727 --> 00:53:01.351\nAlways good.\n\n1132\n00:53:01.351 --> 00:53:02.397\n>> In this episode,\n\n1133\n00:53:02.397 --> 00:53:07.229\nTodd took us through the advantage here\nof learning how to subnet easily, right?\n\n1134\n00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:09.623\n>> Very easily.\n>> Getting away from the idea of having to\n\n1135\n00:53:09.623 --> 00:53:10.599\nlearn the binary.\n\n1136\n00:53:10.599 --> 00:53:13.933\nMaking sure, of course, that you\nunderstand the method that he's been using\n\n1137\n00:53:13.933 --> 00:53:17.300\nthat has really helped him to be\nsuccessful, and helped him to get quicker.\n\n1138\n00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.110\nAnd the idea on the exam,\nof course, is fairly simple.\n\n1139\n00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:24.260\nWe need to know these concepts because\nthere is no time for you to sit down and\n\n1140\n00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.560\nthink that you can write out the binary\nbits, and get ready to answer those\n\n1141\n00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:31.660\nquestions, and answer them correctly, and\nfinish the entire exam at the same time.\n\n1142\n00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.540\nSo take a look at this\nparticular video over and\n\n1143\n00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.200\nover again until it\nreally does make sense.\n\n1144\n00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.670\nMake sure you learn how\nto count by sixteen.\n\n1145\n00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:39.830\nObviously, I can't.\n\n1146\n00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:40.678\nBut overall\n\n1147\n00:53:40.678 --> 00:53:41.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> make sure\n\n1148\n00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.070\n>> You're better at it now, though.\n\n1149\n00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.340\n>> Yeah, make sure you learn\nhow to do that as well, and\n\n1150\n00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.120\nthat's going to help out.\n\n1151\n00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.910\nAnd what we did is we really\nfocused in on the Class Cs.\n\n1152\n00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.535\nBut we do have more subnetting to come,\nso make sure you also stay tuned for\n\n1153\n00:53:52.535 --> 00:53:53.651\nthat episode as well.\n\n1154\n00:53:53.651 --> 00:53:55.640\nAnd that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off.\n\n1155\n00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.404\nFor ITProTV,\n>> Yes.\n\n1156\n00:53:57.404 --> 00:53:58.948\n>> I've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n1157\n00:53:58.948 --> 00:54:00.005\n>> And that was a lot of fun.\n\n1158\n00:54:00.005 --> 00:54:01.073\nThank you for joining me.\n\n1159\n00:54:01.073 --> 00:54:02.292\nMy name is Todd Lamley.\n\n1160\n00:54:02.292 -->

He points out where confusion and problems occur doing subnetting on larger address space.  Using multiple examples, Todd demonstrates the most like type of subnetting questions that a CCENT candidate will tend to face.  He also emphasizes the necessity of this skill without doing binary conversion or ANDing if you’re pursuing the CCENT.",

00:00:19.620\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're taking a look at ICND1 content and\n\n4\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.530\ngetting ready for that exam.\n\n5\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.000\nAnd to help us actually focus in\non that exam content we have Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.790\nTodd Lammie here in our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.860\nThank you for being here,\nglad you're back.\n\n8\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.830\n>> Great, thank you so much,\nit's great to be back here this morning.\n\n9\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.930\nNow we're gonna head right into\nthe objectives for subneting and\n\n10\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.640\nthen we're gonna head VLSM summarization.\n\n11\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120\nBut we're gonna start with\nclass B this morning.\n\n12\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.770\nSo if you're just joining us and\n\n13\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340\nyou missed yesterday where we were\ndoing class C introduction to TCPIP,\n\n14\n00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820\nwe did ethernet and we spent all day\non internetworking and what not.\n\n15\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.810\nBut we're going to hit class B now so\nI'm going to jump ahead like hey,\n\n16\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.350\nyou've been here okay.\n\n17\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.960\nSo if you're just joining us this\nmorning you might have to go back and\n\n18\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.350\nreview the videos.\n\n19\n00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.398\nAll right so listen let's go ahead,\nI'm gonna head towards the videos,\n\n20\n00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:04.430\ntowards the objectives.\n\n21\n00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.440\nOne of the things you\nguys gotta understand is,\n\n22\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.890\nyou have to be able to subnet, no ifs ands\nor buts, in your head, in zero seconds.\n\n23\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.430\nAll right, so\ntime has gone where you can, you know,\n\n24\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.800\nI just don't understand classes where they\nsay well, you and and or, and do all.\n\n25\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.620\nForget it, you won't be able to\nget your CSNA and your all right?\n\n26\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.450\nSo, we're not gonna do any of that.\n\n27\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.130\nWe're gonna take off from where we left\nyesterday, but we're using my block sizes,\n\n28\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580\ncount, we're gonna see a slash\nnotation turn into a mass,\n\n29\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.300\nturn into a block size, we're done, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.482\nNow, we're gonna turn that\ninto Class B guys, you ready?\n\n31\n00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:34.615\nAnd then again, as in yesterday,\nwe're gonna test Ronnie.\n\n32\n00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.270\nHe's gonna be a subnetting expert\nby the time I'm done here.\n\n33\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.522\nAll right, Class B /17, my friends.\n\n34\n00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:45.935\nWe have to know our slash\nterminology right, /8 through /30.\n\n35\n00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:50.301\nSo we understand there is a /31 but\nit's not covered in the CCNA, so\n\n36\n00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:51.660\nwe only go to /30.\n\n37\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.726\nThat being said, Class B subletting, /17.\n\n38\n00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:58.094\nSo notice this is my 172.16,\n\n39\n00:01:58.094 --> 00:02:00.940\nthis is a Class B, RFC-\n>> 1918.\n\n40\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.850\n>> 1918, thank you, address, right.\n\n41\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.700\nSo that's one of my private addresses.\n\n42\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.320\nNow if I look at,\nhere's my default mask, 255.255 and\n\n43\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.920\nthen my mask here in\nthe third octet is a 128.\n\n44\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.110\nWell, we know that we start\nsubnetting right here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.960\nSo how many bits am I using here, Ronnie,\nto subnet with this first subnet mask?\n\n46\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.230\n>> You're doing all 17, or\nyou're adding in the extra one?\n\n47\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.170\n>> Yeah, just one subnet bit,\ncuz these are my default bits.\n\n48\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.440\nI can't change those, obviously,\nyou can never change those or\n\n49\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.660\nanything until we get to summarization,\nthen we'll screw with them.\n\n50\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But for now,\n\n51\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.725\nwe have one subnet bit, right?\n\n52\n00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:41.003\nWe list that down here,\none subnet bit, and this gives us,\n\n53\n00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:42.810\nhow many host bits here?\n\n54\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.790\nWe have eight here and\nseven here, that's a lot.\n\n55\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.230\nThe answer is who cares right.\n\n56\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.050\nYou have a lot of hosts,\n\n57\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.338\nmore than you can implement on any host\never in this galaxy, world, whatever.\n\n58\n00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:57.750\nAll right so, when we were in Class C,\nwe had a 128 mask and\n\n59\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.630\nlet's talk about this for a second so\nwe don't det all stressed out.\n\n60\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.270\nA 128 mask is the block size of 128.\n\n61\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.360\nAnd starting at zero,\nwhich were we always count.\n\n62\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.240\nRemember we talked about\nthe IP subnet zero yesterday.\n\n63\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.320\nZero, and then we count increase of\nour block size until we get to 256.\n\n64\n00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.000\nSo might subnet would be zero,\nthe next subnet 128 and then 256, right?\n\n65\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.690\nAnd we know we can't use 256, but\nI just can't, I've been thorough here.\n\n66\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.980\nZero is my first subnet and next subnet\nis 128, and then the broadcast address of\n\n67\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.200\nmy zero subnet is always the number right\nbefore the next subnet, in this case, 127.\n\n68\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.801\nAnd yes, I know there's a fourth octet,\nhang in there.\n\n69\n00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.466\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> 128, the next increment is 256 so\n\n70\n00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.441\nI put a 255 here.\n\n71\n00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:42.850\nThis is my third octet information.\n\n72\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.770\nSo I'm taking the same subnets\nthat I had in the fourth octet,\n\n73\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.110\nmoving them to the third octet, right?\n\n74\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.890\nAnd I have the same exact numbers.\n\n75\n00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.490\nSo that's why this method is so great.\n\n76\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.610\nBecause once we get our method down,\ndoing Class C,\n\n77\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.760\nwe're not all stressed out or\nanxietized, we move into the second and\n\n78\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.710\nthird octet and\nthe numbers are exactly the same.\n\n79\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.690\nBut there's one small difference.\n\n80\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.380\nEasy, small difference and\nthat is in the fourth octet.\n\n81\n00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.570\nIf we look at this, this is a zero here.\n\n82\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.350\nWhich means we have zero subnet bits,\nzero subnet bits.\n\n83\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.010\nSo, Ronnie, if I want to get a network\naddress, what do I do to host bits?\n\n84\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.780\n>> To get the network address?\n\n85\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.490\n>> Yes.\n>> We normally zero them all\n\n86\n00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.150\nout on the host bits.\n\n87\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.500\n>> Yes, we turn them all off is\nthe answer, he is correct again.\n\n88\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.300\nSo that's your first one today.\n\n89\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.345\n>> Thank you.\n>> One for one so far.\n\n90\n00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:29.354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's two, cuz you got the block side.\n\n91\n00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:33.318\nZero, right, is my network\naddress all hosts bits off, so\n\n92\n00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:35.810\nI put a zero in the fourth octet.\n\n93\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.690\nAnd then Ronnie, if I'm looking for\nmy broadcast address,\n\n94\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.940\nwhat do I do with host bits now?\n\n95\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.640\n>> We turn them all on.\n\n96\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.430\n>> We turn them all on so\nwhen the fourth octet,\n\n97\n00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.160\nsince this is a zero and they're all\nhost bits, then that would be a 255.\n\n98\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.210\nSo if we look down here,\nactually, where I wrote it out,\n\n99\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.950\nthird octet is my same answers for\nmy block size of 128 here.\n\n100\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.306\nAnd my block is here, but whatever.\n\n101\n00:04:52.306 --> 00:04:57.200\n128, so zero's my first subnet, the next\nsubnet's 128, a 127 in the third octet.\n\n102\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.520\nRemember these were the same\nanswers in the fourth octet\n\n103\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.330\nmove them to the third octet,\nadd a zero and a .255 at the end.\n\n104\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.010\nSo this isn't hard.\n\n105\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.700\nAgain, I took the same answers I had\nbefore, moved them to the octet, that's\n\n106\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.470\ninteresting, in this case the third one,\nand then added my host bits on the right.\n\n107\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.700\nIt's either one or two octets,\nin this case one, added .0 and a .255.\n\n108\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.549\nThere is no other answer, at .0 and .285.\n\n109\n00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:24.220\nNow when we start subnetting into\nthe fourth octet with class A or\n\n110\n00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.740\nB then we'll come up\nwith different answers.\n\n111\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.548\nBut we're not doing that now,\nso let's not jump ahead.\n\n112\n00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:29.410\n.0 and .285 is always my answer.\n\n113\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.115\nSo if my next subnet is 128,\nthen what's my true subnet and\n\n114\n00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:35.985\nmy true broadcast address for\nthe next subnet?\n\n115\n00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:40.884\n>> The 128.0.\n\n116\n00:05:40.884 --> 00:05:44.098\n>> So we're gonna say it now\nsince we're in class A or B,\n\n117\n00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:49.310\nwe say 128.0 in this example and\nmy broadcast address 127.255, right?\n\n118\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.800\nSo it's a full I'm sorry,\n255.255 for my second subnet here.\n\n119\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.620\nAll right, so again, two subnets with a\n128 mask, whether you're class A, B, or C.\n\n120\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.270\nIf you have a 128 mask,\nyou have a block size of 128,\n\n121\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.770\nyour subnets are zero and 255.\n\n122\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.400\nTo the right of that are all host bits,\nand if you're doing A or B then it\n\n123\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.770\nwould be .0 and .255 for your broadcast,\nyour subnet broadcast out there.\n\n124\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.758\nSo let's take a look at the next one.\n\n125\n00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:19.080\nThis is a slash what?\n\n126\n00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.439\nSo right here, so let's take a look here.\n\n127\n00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:27.060\nSo I'm at 172.16, right and\nhere's eight 16, right this is my default.\n\n128\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.536\nI'm not screwing with that\nwhile I'm subnetting.\n\n129\n00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:33.120\nIn the third octet though,\nI'm playing with the bits here.\n\n130\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.499\nI'm sitting at two bits here, but\nagain, I don't care about the bits,\n\n131\n00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:36.240\nI really don't here.\n\n132\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.400\nI have 192 mask.\n\n133\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.647\nWhat I care about is that I understand\nthis is a /18, cuz 8, 16 and 2.\n\n134\n00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:49.638\nThis is a /18, so\n192 mask with a block size of what?\n\n135\n00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:50.323\n>> 64.\n\n136\n00:06:50.323 --> 00:06:55.752\n>> 64, so now,\nI count by 64s until I get to 256,\n\n137\n00:06:55.752 --> 00:06:59.808\nstarting at 0, 0, 64,\n>> 128.\n\n138\n00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:01.399\n>> 128, 192, right?\n\n139\n00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:07.238\nSo [COUGH] If I'm in the zero subnet,\nthe next subnet's 64 in the third octet,\n\n140\n00:07:07.238 --> 00:07:12.440\nnext block size in the third octet is 64,\nso I put a 63 down here.\n\n141\n00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.510\nThen my fourth octet is all host bits, so\nI just add a .0 and a .285, very simple.\n\n142\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.110\nOkay, don't get confused, because I'm\nnot going to sit here and go, okay,\n\n143\n00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.870\nnow I went through the easy part,\nlet me get to the hard part, right?\n\n144\n00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.480\nThat's not going to happen.\n\n145\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.620\nThis is it, right?\n\n146\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.390\nYou're going to have your block sizes.\n\n147\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.633\nYou put the number right before the next\nsubnet in that octet [INAUDIBLE].\n\n148\n00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:36.960\nThen you add to the right your host bits,\na .0 or a .285, right.\n\n149\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.250\nThis is my full answer here.\n\n150\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.470\nThis would be a lot easier if\nyou were here yesterday and\n\n151\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.930\nyou went through the class C, I think.\n\n152\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.728\nBut nonetheless, you have a chance\nto go back there and watch that.\n\n153\n00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:50.938\nNow, 64.0 is my next subnet and\nso, 60, 0, 64,\n\n154\n00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:56.376\n128, 192,\nwe're counting in blocks for the 192.\n\n155\n00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:58.296\nAll right, so if I'm 64,\nthe next subnet's 128.\n\n156\n00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:00.410\nWhat was one of the keys that\nwe learned yesterday Ronnie?\n\n157\n00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.400\nIs that what subnet is in every mask?\n\n158\n00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.500\nThere's one subnet in every single mask.\n\n159\n00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.538\n>> That's going to be 128.\n\n160\n00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:09.410\n>> [LAUGH] That is true,\n128 is a subnet in every single mask.\n\n161\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.150\nIf you're not subnetting,\n\n162\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.180\nthen you're not going to have it, but if\nyou subnet at all, 128's always a subnet.\n\n163\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.010\nAnd what address is always\na broadcast address?\n\n164\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.100\n>> Always a broadcast address?\n\n165\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.970\n>> If you're subnetting.\n\n166\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.850\n>> If you're subnetting?\n\n167\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.570\n>> That's my 127.\n\n168\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.345\n>> That's right.\n\n169\n00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:24.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n170\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.310\nSo if I'm ever looking down and\n\n171\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.160\nI'm subnetting,\nI don't care what mask you have.\n\n172\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.920\nIf you have a subnet,\n127 is always a broadcast.\n\n173\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.130\nWell, and 285 as well, but and then 128,\n128 is always a subnet, right?\n\n174\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.200\nSo in this case here,\n\n175\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.810\nthis really helped us yesterday\nbecause when we were subnetting,\n\n176\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.310\nwe're counting up high numbers when we\nwere doing like slash 28 and so on.\n\n177\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.150\nAnd we're up in the 200s.\n\n178\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.450\nIt was easy to start at 128.\n\n179\n00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.130\nWe also learned to go to 256 and\ncount backwards as well.\n\n180\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.370\nThat was kind of helpful\nwith the block sizes.\n\n181\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.810\nSo in the 64 subnet,\nthe next subnet's 128.\n\n182\n00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.580\nSo I put a 12 down here.\n\n183\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.170\nThat's my network and broadcast\naddress if I add a .0 and a .255.\n\n184\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.960\nSo what are my valid hosts?\n\n185\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.138\nThis is the key that we're\nactually trying to get to.\n\n186\n00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:15.380\n64.1 through 127.254, every number.\n\n187\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:21.280\nSo Ronnie, is 65.0 a valid host?\n\n188\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.324\n>> It is a valid host.\n\n189\n00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:24.047\n>> It is a valid host, [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n190\n00:09:24.047 --> 00:09:25.440\nWhat about 66.255?\n\n191\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.190\nI mean, 0 and 255 can't be\nsubnets in broadcast addresses,\n\n192\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.050\naren't they sub-nets of\nbroadcast addresses?\n\n193\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.230\nThey can't be a valid host\nwhenever you see a 0 in 255?\n\n194\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.380\n>> Well, in this case it can.\n\n195\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.290\n>> Absolutely, yes,\na 0 in a 255 is a sub-net and\n\n196\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.590\nbroadcast address some of the time,\nabsolutely not all the time.\n\n197\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:52.695\nIn this example here, 65.0 Is a valid host\nbecause it's between 64.1 and 127.284.\n\n198\n00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:57.760\nAlso, interesting enough,\nmaybe you see 64.255, that's a valid host.\n\n199\n00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.660\nWhat else is a valid host?\n\n200\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.530\nWhat about 126.255?\n\n201\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.180\nAgain, any number between this range.\n\n202\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.790\nSo just because you see a 0 and\n\n203\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.210\n255 does not mean it's a subnet\nin a broadcast address, right?\n\n204\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.380\nWe have to count in our block\nsizes to determine that.\n\n205\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.280\nAll right, the next one's 128 then 192.\n\n206\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.975\nSo I'll put a 191 down here.\n\n207\n00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:23.090\nAdd a .0 and .0255, I now have my\nnetwork and broadcast address.\n\n208\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.242\nMy valid hosts are the numbers in between.\n\n209\n00:10:25.242 --> 00:10:27.330\n128.1 through191.254.\n\n210\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.602\nAny number in between.\n\n211\n00:10:28.602 --> 00:10:29.440\n130.0, 130.25.\n\n212\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.200\nAny number, all right?\n\n213\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:39.710\nAnd the last one's 192 with the next\nblock size 286, so I put 255 here.\n\n214\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.710\nAdd up zero, 255.\n\n215\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.460\nAnd that's my four subnet\nwith the slash 18.\n\n216\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.980\nNow let's jump over to a /20,\none of Ciscos very masks.\n\n217\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.970\nAll right.\nSo I say this,\n\n218\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.650\nguys, if you were here yesterday,\nyou know that I picked on that /28.\n\n219\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.725\nAnd we had to spend a half hour on that,\nI think.\n\n220\n00:10:56.725 --> 00:10:59.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I kept coming back to it and\n\n221\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.940\ncoming back to it.\n\n222\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.480\nIf you don't know a -/12 -/20 -/28,\ndon't take your test.\n\n223\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.640\nCisco knows you can't count by 16.\n\n224\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.090\nThey know it and you can't, right?\n\n225\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.010\nTell me, show me you can give him this,\nwhat is this Twitter thing?\n\n226\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.570\n>> The chat.\n\n227\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.800\n>> The chat, and get out by 16 for\nme without using your calculator or\n\n228\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.980\nGoogle, all right?\n\n229\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.200\nWill say I'll just use\nGoogle leave it everything.\n\n230\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.206\nAll right, 255.255.240, right?\n\n231\n00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:26.720\nThis is a 240 in the third octet,\n8 16 in fourth octet, I'd care,\n\n232\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.990\nbut it's four subnet bits.\n\n233\n00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.390\nWhat I care about is this right here.\n\n234\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.410\nThis gives me a block size of 16.\n\n235\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.620\nBlock size 16.\n\n236\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.530\nWhat do you think, guys?\n\n237\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.770\nDo you think Ronnie can\ncount by 16's finally?\n\n238\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.780\nWe only worked on it all day yesterday,\nI think.\n\n239\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.530\nDid you do it last night, Ronnie?\n\n240\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.405\n>> Of course I did.\n\n241\n00:11:43.405 --> 00:11:44.190\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n242\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.440\nWell, prove it.\n\n243\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.520\nGo.\n[LAUGH] Teddy?\n\n244\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:54.565\n>> I'll start with the first one first.\n\n245\n00:11:54.565 --> 00:11:59.328\nThis is the hardest.\n\n246\n00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:02.070\n[LAUGH]\n0.\n\n247\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.042\n16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96.\nWhat does--\n\n248\n00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:03.544\n>> It's 112.\n\n249\n00:12:03.544 --> 00:12:05.518\n>> 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208,\n\n250\n00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:06.333\n224.240.\n>> Good.\n\n251\n00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:09.770\n[APPLAUSE] All right, Ronnie.\n\n252\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.760\nYou guys practice that every day.\n\n253\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.340\nGo back to yesterday's when I was\ndoing it three or four times,\n\n254\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.050\nRonnie's doing it a couple times,\nget your 16's down.\n\n255\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.470\nSo Ronnie, if I'm in zero subnet, in this\nexample here we're in a Class B /20,\n\n256\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.935\nif I'm in the zero subnet,\nwhat's my broadcast address?\n\n257\n00:12:26.935 --> 00:12:31.230\n>> Your broadcast address, since it's\nthe next network is gonna be 16,\n\n258\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.190\nit should be 15.255.\n\n259\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.267\n>> Yeah, I was waiting for that, he got\nthat four [INAUDIBLE], that was what was\n\n260\n00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:40.430\nimportant, the actual subnews is 0.0,\nand the broadcast 15, right?\n\n261\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.460\nBecause the next increment of 16 is 16.\n\n262\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.940\nAnd then but .285 for the broadcast.\n\n263\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.290\nBecause the fourth octet is all most bets.\n\n264\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.340\nAdd a .0 and a .285.\n\n265\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.640\nSame numbers we use yesterday\nin the fourth octet.\n\n266\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.810\nMove them to the third octet add a .0 and\na .285 and you're done.\n\n267\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.980\nPretty simple.\n\n268\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.310\nNext step after that,\nlet's take a look here.\n\n269\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:06.056\n16, 16.0, next subnet 32.0,\nmakes my broadcast address 31.285.\n\n270\n00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:10.870\nAgain, maybe it's just easier to count 0,\n16, 32 but the 31 under the second or\n\n271\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.960\nthird octet, whether you're in class a or\nb, it doesn't matter.\n\n272\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.910\nIf I was doing class a in this\nexample then, my subnet would actually\n\n273\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.880\nbe 16.0.0 And\nbroadcast would be 13.255.255.\n\n274\n00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.160\nFor all the 0s to my right, I just add\na 0 to a 0, 255, 255 for the broadcast,\n\n275\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:26.889\nvery simple.\n\n276\n00:13:28.093 --> 00:13:33.280\nAnd then the very last one,\nlet's go to the last one, 240.0.\n\n277\n00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.400\nAnd the next increment is 266, so\nI put a 255 there, added a .0 and a .35.\n\n278\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.620\nNow what do I do with this information,\nguys?\n\n279\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.160\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n280\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.020\nI can do this, I can do this.\n\n281\n00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:50.210\nOkay then, riddle me this then guys.\n\n282\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.240\nWhat the heck, I wrote a class c,\nso I'll give you that one.\n\n283\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.140\nLet's practice with a class c.\n\n284\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.500\nActually, I should have\nwarmed up with a class c.\n\n285\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.020\nI think, right?\nKind of like going to the gym.\n\n286\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.990\nCounting my block sizes.\n\n287\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.790\n>> The subnet would be 160.\n\n288\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.400\n>> Good.\n\n289\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.010\nSee that?\n>> Yeah.\n\n290\n00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.485\n>> You know how he got that guys?\n\n291\n00:14:07.485 --> 00:14:09.110\nBecause he can count by 16s.\n\n292\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.300\nRight, so he knew right away.\n\n293\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.480\nSo if you can count by 16s,\nyou'd see that subnet.\n\n294\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.820\nThen you would also know what\nthe broadcast address is right away.\n\n295\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.441\n>> Yeah, the broadcast address.\n\n296\n00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:20.499\nIf I know 176 is the next one [CROSSTALK],\n175 would be my broadcast.\n\n297\n00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:23.250\n>> Right, 165 through 174.\n\n298\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.440\nNow that's a class c as we know.\n\n299\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.440\nOkay, let's do it this way.\n\n300\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.530\nHow about this?\n\n301\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:36.530\n200 dot 200 slash 20 Right?\n\n302\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.360\nThen I'm going to get class A for fun.\n\n303\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.230\nBecause this is fun, right?\n\n304\n00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.440\nThis is fun.\n\n305\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.620\nRight?\nIt's why you're here.\n\n306\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.290\n>> With me again?\n>> Well,\n\n307\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.950\nI don't have anyone else to pick on.\n\n308\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.460\nNo one else is out there.\n\n309\n00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:56.040\n>> The new subnet, or the beginning\nsubset, would be 172.16.192.0?\n\n310\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.060\nAwesome.\n\n311\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.570\n>> 192, okay?\nSo 192.0 subnet.\n\n312\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.440\nBroadcast and that will be 207.255.\n\n313\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.790\n>> There you go.\n\n314\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.550\n>> Did you hear that guys?\n\n315\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.850\nDid you see that?\n\n316\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.980\nLet's see if you can do\nthat with a class a.\n\n317\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.472\nHow about this one?\n\n318\n00:15:14.472 --> 00:15:15.850\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:16.350\n>> 10.\n\n320\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.210\nWhat do we\n\n321\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.216\nwant to do?\n209.1.1./12.\n\n322\n00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:22.990\nBaby, 10.209.1.1./12 I'm loving it,\n\n323\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.765\nloving it.\nIt's easy guys.\n\n324\n00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:27.120\n>> [LAUGH] Network is 208?\n\n325\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.750\n>> Yeah, it's pretty simple, really.\n\n326\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.500\nIf you count by 16s, we can actually\nsee 209 is obviously in the 208 subnet.\n\n327\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.362\nSo, my sum in here guys,\nif we want to write the whole thing out.\n\n328\n00:15:38.362 --> 00:15:40.623\n10.208.\n\n329\n00:15:40.623 --> 00:15:41.378\nWhat?\n\n330\n00:15:41.378 --> 00:15:42.885\n0.0.\n\n331\n00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.245\n>> And my broadcast be 10.\n\n332\n00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:47.325\n>> 223?\n\n333\n00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:49.245\n>> 225, 225.\n\n334\n00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:51.158\nAll right?\n\n335\n00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:53.258\nDoesn't matter if you're in the second,\nthird, or\n\n336\n00:15:53.258 --> 00:15:55.220\nfourth octet, the numbers do not change.\n\n337\n00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.250\nJust if you move to the second octet,\nyou just have to put more zeros in.\n\n338\n00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.490\nMore 255s, that's it, all right?\n\n339\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.420\nOkay, slash 21.\n\n340\n00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.560\nGetting pretty simple here.\n\n341\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.750\nBecause we're a block size\nof what in the third octet?\n\n342\n00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.930\nA block size of.\n\n343\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:08.440\n>> Eight.\n\n344\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.060\n>> Eight.\n\n345\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.330\nRight?\nSo 0, 8, 16 if I'm in the 0 subnet.\n\n346\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.120\nNext subnet's 8.\n\n347\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.320\nAnd the third octet or\nnext block size is 8, so I put a 7 here.\n\n348\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.480\nI add a .0 and a .255 to get my subnet and\nbroadcast number.\n\n349\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.145\nPretty simple.\n\n350\n00:16:22.145 --> 00:16:23.210\n/22.\n\n351\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.700\nOkay.\n\n352\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.570\nWe're gonna get to some.\n\n353\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.910\nNow, this one's use a lot of\nCisco's access list objectives.\n\n354\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.000\nThey don't have that\n/22 in the third octet.\n\n355\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.370\nSo, it's 252 mass, okay.\n\n356\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.347\nLet's go through this again.\n\n357\n00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:41.000\n/17, 128.0 mass.\n\n358\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.180\n/18, 192.0 mask.\n\n359\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.911\nYes, Ronnie.\n\n360\n00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:46.608\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So where are we at, /19?\n\n361\n00:16:46.608 --> 00:16:47.166\n>> 224.\n\n362\n00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:48.096\n>> 224.0.\n\n363\n00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:48.654\n/20?\n\n364\n00:16:48.654 --> 00:16:49.584\n240.0.\n\n365\n00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:50.142\n/21?\n\n366\n00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:50.700\n>> 250.\n\n367\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.650\n>> 248.0.\n\n368\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.309\n>> 248. See? [LAUGH]\n>> /22?\n\n369\n00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.840\n>> 252.\n\n370\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.893\n>> 252.0, okay, and\nwe'll go on from there.\n\n371\n00:16:57.893 --> 00:17:05.130\nWe have to know those, all right?\n\n372\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:05.960\nHave to know them.\n\n373\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.740\nAll right, 252,\nblock size of 4 in the third octet.\n\n374\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.800\nSo my subnets here,\nI'll just write them out here, 0 4 8.\n\n375\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.520\nRight, so what is my broadcast address,\nsubnet and\n\n376\n00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.530\nbroadcast address of the first subnet?\n\n377\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.095\nWell, my next increment of four in\nthe third octet is a 4 so I put a 3 here.\n\n378\n00:17:23.095 --> 00:17:31.365\n0.0 3.255, right, so I have it written\nout here but here's my valid host.\n\n379\n00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:34.339\n4.0, 8.0, 12.0, right?\n\n380\n00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:38.800\nNow, there's a couple other mass here but\nlet me take you to the two easiest mass\n\n381\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.890\nBut the next one gets a little confusing,\nwhy?\n\n382\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.880\nBecause we don't see it in production,\nbut it's the easiest one, let me explain.\n\n383\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.280\nAll right, so let's take a look,\nand that's gonna be,\n\n384\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.840\nif we're at a /22,\nwhat would that be then?\n\n385\n00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.430\nA /23, what is that mask?\n\n386\n00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.320\n>> Gonna be 254.\n\n387\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.320\n>> 254 is correct,\nlet's take a look at this, guys.\n\n388\n00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.800\nSo this is /23.\n\n389\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.650\nCisco likes this one too because they\nknow you don't use it in production and\n\n390\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.550\nmost people get confused by seeing\nit because we don't use it a lot.\n\n391\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.920\nAlthough it's a very good mass because\nit gives us about a hundred hosts per\n\n392\n00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.800\nbroadcast domain and 500 subnets.\n\n393\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.590\n>> 520 Yes.\n\n394\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.400\n>> It's actually kind of\na cool little mask right, but\n\n395\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.380\nthat's not what makes it cool.\n\n396\n00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.400\nCheck this out.\n\n397\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.920\nIt's a block size of what?\n\n398\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.116\nTwo D six minus two D four is?\n\n399\n00:18:20.116 --> 00:18:20.720\n>> Two.\n>> Two.\n\n400\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.778\nCan you guys count by two?\n\n401\n00:18:22.778 --> 00:18:25.820\n>> [LAUGH] Don't know\n>> Maybe.\n\n402\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.110\nSo it would look something like this,\nalright?\n\n403\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.400\nThis is in the third octet, because that's\nwhat we're playing, zero, two, four, six,\n\n404\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.060\neight, ten, right?\n\n405\n00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.710\nSomething like that.\n\n406\n00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.410\nAlright, if I'm in the zero subnet,\nI put a two here.\n\n407\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.700\nBut wait, hang on I'm getting there,\nI put a two in the next one.\n\n408\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.170\nThe number for that is three.\n\n409\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.040\nI mean the number I had for that is one.\n\n410\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.310\nAnyways, I added a .0 and a .255.\n\n411\n00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.480\nAnd it had my network and subnet address.\n\n412\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.990\nPretty simple, same thing we've done for\nthe last couple days.\n\n413\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.270\nBut there's something\neasier about this one.\n\n414\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.768\nThe answer is because it's a block size\nof two we really don't skip anything.\n\n415\n00:18:58.768 --> 00:19:02.128\nSo here's the results on this one.\n\n416\n00:19:02.128 --> 00:19:06.685\nIf you have an even number that ends in 0,\n\n417\n00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:10.088\ncheck it out, it's a subnet.\n\n418\n00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:15.402\nEven that ends in .0,\n\n419\n00:19:15.402 --> 00:19:19.126\nequals subnet.\n\n420\n00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:26.528\nOdd Ends .285 broadcast.\n\n421\n00:19:26.528 --> 00:19:29.566\nEvery time, no exceptions.\n\n422\n00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:31.346\n0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\n423\n00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:34.810\nIf it ends in 0 it's a subnet,\nit means it's not a valid host.\n\n424\n00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.470\nWhy is this easy?\n\n425\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.400\nBecause Cisco will say,\nhey find the valid hosts, all right, so\n\n426\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.250\nall you do is take out all the even\nnumbers that end in zero, and\n\n427\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.870\nall the odd numbers within 255 and\nyou're left with what?\n\n428\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.250\nThe correct answers.\n\n429\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.110\nIt doesn't get any easier than this\nbecause you don't even have to subnet,\n\n430\n00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.952\nyou have to be able to tell\nthe difference between even and odd\n\n431\n00:19:51.952 --> 00:19:52.532\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:19:52.532 --> 00:19:53.567\n>> But other than that,\n\n433\n00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:54.474\nyou are good to go.\n\n434\n00:19:54.474 --> 00:19:58.060\nSo Even number, ends in zero, subnet.\n\n435\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.330\nOkay odd number then isn't 285.\n\n436\n00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.710\nBroadcaster I'm going to test\nyou on this in a minute so\n\n437\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.440\nhold on to that thought guys.\n\n438\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.740\nActually I'll probably\npick on Ronnie [LAUGH] so,\n\n439\n00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.210\nhold on to that thought Ronnie.\n\n440\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:12.040\nAll right guys, let me tell you if\nyou are struggling with counting\n\n441\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.240\nby 16s we did Eights, what about\ncounting by twos maybe you're okay.\n\n442\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.190\nHow about ones?\n\n443\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.280\nCan we count by one?\n\n444\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.933\nAll right, here we go.\n\n445\n00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:22.670\n[LAUGH] So, this is a class B.\n\n446\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.940\nLet's take a look here.\n\n447\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.990\nThat means, take a look here,\nthis is intriguing.\n\n448\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.990\nLet's talk about this for\na second, this is a class B,\n\n449\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.290\nthese are all subnet bits now.\n\n450\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.020\nNow these are all host bits.\n\n451\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.300\nThat's what host bits look like.\n\n452\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.020\nAll right, so in the third octet,\nI have nothing but subnet bets.\n\n453\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.460\nNo matter what number I tell you,\nit's a subnet.\n\n454\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.020\n1, 69, 109, 169.\n\n455\n00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.720\nWhatever number I just say, it's a subnet.\n\n456\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.200\nNow this is why people use this mask\nBecause they look at the address.\n\n457\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.440\nSomeone says 172.16.10 something and\nthey go that's in subnet 10.\n\n458\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.920\nEveryone goes you're so smart.\n\n459\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.250\nWell, it's right there.\n\n460\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.330\nIt says right there, right?\n\n461\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.100\nSo it's hard to screw up.\n\n462\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.140\nI'm not saying people don't screw this up,\nthey do, it's just harder to screw it up.\n\n463\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.800\nNow, that being said, this is my subnets,\nthese are my hosts, So\n\n464\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.590\nagain, there are no host\nbits in the third octet.\n\n465\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.940\nNo host bits in the third octet.\n\n466\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.370\nEvery number is a subnet, right?\n\n467\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.770\nSo from 0 to 255, 256 subnets.\n\n468\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:26.260\nThe fourth octet is all host bits\nexcept if they're all off or all on.\n\n469\n00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.640\nThat's my network and broadcast address.\n\n470\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.540\nSo I start with here at zero,\nlet's go down here a little bit.\n\n471\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.610\nStart here with zero, and\nthe next sub net is 1, for 1 is zero.\n\n472\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.990\nSo I keep zero in the third octet.\n\n473\n00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.870\nAnd then the next shot is 0 285 for\nmy network and broadcast address.\n\n474\n00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.530\nMy valid host are the numbers\nin between here.\n\n475\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.820\n1 through 254.\n\n476\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.040\nMost people use this mask, right?\n\n477\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.450\nThey either use a class c,\nwhich is basically the same thing.\n\n478\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.870\nBut this gives you just a lot more subnets\nwith one network address, that's all.\n\n479\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:57.470\nOkay?\nSo,\n\n480\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.940\nwhat have you gotten out of this one here?\n\n481\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.710\nAnything in the third\noctet is a subnet bed.\n\n482\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:04.830\nRight, that's what I want you to remember.\n\n483\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.150\nThere are no host bits in there.\n\n484\n00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.850\nAny number you say is a subnet.\n\n485\n00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.370\nHold that thought.\n\n486\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.900\nNow, so let's go to this.\n\n487\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.130\nAnd tell me, Ronnie, can I do this?\n\n488\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.210\nI mean, we did this with Class C.\n\n489\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.880\nWe had the 128 in the fourth octet.\n\n490\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.520\nMy subnets are 0 and\n128 in the fourth octet.\n\n491\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.080\nBut wait This is a Class B.\n\n492\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.400\nBy the way, let's stop Ronnie.\n\n493\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.800\nWhat tells me this is\na Class B besides the numbers?\n\n494\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.230\nWhat is the bit range in the first\noctet that tells me that it's Class B?\n\n495\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.370\n>> It should begin with a 0 and a 1.\n\n496\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.600\n>> 01 is right, and a Class A starts with-\n>> 0.\n\n497\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.180\n>> The first bit in the first\noctet must always be a 0.\n\n498\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.980\nIn a class B the first\ntwo bits must be a 01.\n\n499\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.040\nIn a class C.\n\n500\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.980\n>> 110.\n>> 110 okay CCNA objectives right there.\n\n501\n00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.400\nNow 172 then tells us it's a class B.\n\n502\n00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.620\nSo the last two by default\nare all host bits.\n\n503\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.120\nBut what we're saying here is no, no,\n\n504\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.540\nno, I want the third octet to\nbe all subnet bits, right.\n\n505\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.910\nAny number I say in this case,\nin the third octet, is a subnet.\n\n506\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.348\n10, 20, 50, 89, whatever,\nis a subnet, no matter what number.\n\n507\n00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:15.500\nNow so [COUGH] the fourth octet though,\nis even easier.\n\n508\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.010\nBecause we have a 128 mask\nwith a block size of 128.\n\n509\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.040\nMy subnets are [COUGH] 0 and 128.\n\n510\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.420\nAll right.\n\n511\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:30.970\nSo, for every summit, so, check this\nout guys, This mask, a slash 25.\n\n512\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.890\nI'm gonna go back to slash 23.\n\n513\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.084\nDon't forget that.\n\n514\n00:23:34.084 --> 00:23:36.130\nA /25 gives me 500 subnets.\n\n515\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.090\n512 subnets, right?\n\n516\n00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:44.526\nSo, I'm sorry, that's yeah, 500 subnets\nand then each of the 126 hosts.\n\n517\n00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:46.206\nThe opposite of the /23.\n\n518\n00:23:46.206 --> 00:23:49.973\nBecause the /23 gave us 500 subnets\nused with 100 host, I mean,\n\n519\n00:23:49.973 --> 00:23:52.596\n500 hosts leads to 100 subnets or\nwhatever.\n\n520\n00:23:52.596 --> 00:23:56.994\nSo this was the opposite of that 500\nsubnets here, cuz we have 8 plus 1,\n\n521\n00:23:56.994 --> 00:23:57.975\n9 subnet bits.\n\n522\n00:23:57.975 --> 00:23:59.600\nWe don't care about bits.\n\n523\n00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.705\nWe're just looking at block sizes but\nI like to give you a foundation.\n\n524\n00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:08.005\nThe very first subnet in the third\noctet is 0, so the next one would be 1.\n\n525\n00:24:08.005 --> 00:24:12.889\nBut wait, for\nevery subnet in the third octet I\n\n526\n00:24:12.889 --> 00:24:17.657\nhave two in the fourth octet, 0 and 128.\n\n527\n00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:18.620\n0 and 128.\n\n528\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:24.173\nSo my first subnet is 0, my next\nsubnet would be 1 in the third octet,\n\n529\n00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:26.730\n2 in the third octet, 3, 4.\n\n530\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:32.180\nAnd for every number in the third octet I\njust add a .0 and a .128 for my networks.\n\n531\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.340\nSo if I'm in the first subnet 0,\nmy first subnet is 0.0.\n\n532\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.356\nMy next subnet is 0.128,\n\n533\n00:24:39.356 --> 00:24:43.999\nwhich makes my broadcast average 0.127.\n\n534\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.700\nThe next subnet is 0.128, so\nmy broadcast out is 0.285.\n\n535\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.310\nAll of my subnetting really\nbeing done in the fourth octet.\n\n536\n00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:58.140\nWe just changed the number by one in\nthe third octet, add a .0 and a .128 for\n\n537\n00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.370\nsubnets in the fourth octet.\n\n538\n00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.862\nThat one's a little bit trickier, right?\n\n539\n00:25:02.862 --> 00:25:07.910\nThe /23, and let's take a look\nat this one one more time.\n\n540\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:13.820\nThis has seven subnet bits, so it gives\nme 128 subnets, each with 500 hosts.\n\n541\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.870\nIt's the opposite of the /25, isn't it?\n\n542\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.760\nKeep that in mind.\nWe'll come back to it.\n\n543\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.370\nAll right, so now, Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.\n\n544\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.644\nAll right, I think he's two for\ntwo so far,\n\n545\n00:25:23.644 --> 00:25:24.314\nright,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n546\n00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:24.814\n>> today?\n\n547\n00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:26.120\nHe was about 60%\n\n548\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.390\nyesterday.\nAll right.\n\n549\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.600\n172.16, 10.90, guys, pull out your pens.\n\n550\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.000\nWhat subnet is this in?\n\n551\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.230\nWhat's the broadcast address and\nvalid host range?\n\n552\n00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.130\nRight, five seconds.\n\n553\n00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.070\nReady?\n\n554\n00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.570\nGo.\n\n555\n00:25:40.946 --> 00:25:42.040\nOkay.\n\n556\n00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.630\nThree, two, one.\n\n557\n00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.700\nWhat's the answer, Ronnie?\n\n558\n00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.284\n>> All right, so the first subnet\n\n559\n00:25:49.284 --> 00:25:53.523\nthere is gonna be 10.0.\n\n560\n00:25:53.523 --> 00:25:54.940\n>> Is he right, guys?\n\n561\n00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.136\nIs he right, what do you think?\n\n562\n00:25:56.136 --> 00:25:56.982\nHe's not, is he?\n\n563\n00:25:56.982 --> 00:25:57.655\n>> I don't know.\n\n564\n00:25:57.655 --> 00:25:58.549\n>> What's the right answer, guys?\n\n565\n00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:59.742\nSomeone tell me, up here.\n\n566\n00:25:59.742 --> 00:26:00.395\n>> 192, sorry.\n\n567\n00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:01.788\n>> It's a 192 mask.\n\n568\n00:26:01.788 --> 00:26:04.731\nNow the one thing we want to look\nat here guys, this is a class B,\n\n569\n00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:08.468\nthird octet's all subnets, so the answer\nis pretty simple in the third octet.\n\n570\n00:26:08.468 --> 00:26:09.140\nIt's a 10.\n\n571\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.350\nI can see it right there.\n\n572\n00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.720\nI'm so smart because I can look\nat that and write it down.\n\n573\n00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.162\nIt's a 10, right?\n\n574\n00:26:14.162 --> 00:26:15.600\nSo that's my subnet in the third octet.\n\n575\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.970\nIn the fourth octet, I have a 192 mask,\nwhich gives me a block size of what?\n\n576\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.010\n>> Should be 64.\n\n577\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.892\n>> 64.\nSo my subnets are what, Ronnie?\n\n578\n00:26:23.892 --> 00:26:26.272\n>> Should be 0, 64, 128.\n\n579\n00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:28.487\n>> Right, so this guy's in the what?\n\n580\n00:26:28.487 --> 00:26:29.730\n>> This one is in the 64.\n\n581\n00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.504\n>> He is, and\nthe broadcast then would be what?\n\n582\n00:26:32.504 --> 00:26:34.019\n>> 127.\n>> 10\n\n583\n00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:34.860\n>> 10.127.\n\n584\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.544\n>> .127.\n\n585\n00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:37.357\nIs he right, now?\n\n586\n00:26:37.357 --> 00:26:38.623\nThat is the correct answer.\n\n587\n00:26:38.623 --> 00:26:41.823\n[SOUND] So we're what,\nthree for four, now?\n\n588\n00:26:41.823 --> 00:26:42.330\n>> Maybe.\n\n589\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:48.698\n>> 10.64, cuz 0's in the fourth octet,\n0, 64, 128.\n\n590\n00:26:48.698 --> 00:26:53.920\nI pass this number, I know I'm in\nthe 64 subnet in the fourth octet.\n\n591\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.060\nAnd the next subnet's 128, so\n127 is my broadcast in the fourth octet.\n\n592\n00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.190\nI add the third octet information in there\nto list, technically correct, my subnet.\n\n593\n00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.410\nNow, the easiest question ever.\n\n594\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.590\nYou never wanna miss this\none because it's so easy.\n\n595\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.250\nBut let me tell you something,\nhad you not gone through this with me,\n\n596\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.310\nyou'd have been like I don't know,\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n597\n00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.060\nWhat's the key on this one guys?\n\n598\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.121\nWhat's the key?\n\n599\n00:27:17.121 --> 00:27:18.735\nEven and odd, even and odd.\n\n600\n00:27:18.735 --> 00:27:20.370\nAll right, ready, set.\n\n601\n00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.440\nWhich are valid hosts?\n\n602\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.325\nGo, Ronny.\n\n603\n00:27:22.325 --> 00:27:28.431\n>> B, C,\n>> Is he right?\n\n604\n00:27:28.431 --> 00:27:28.933\n>> F.\n\n605\n00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:30.315\n>> He's 50% right so far.\n\n606\n00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:34.959\n>> For the valid hosts?\n\n607\n00:27:34.959 --> 00:27:35.841\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n608\n00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:41.633\n>> B, C, E.\n\n609\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.160\n>> Okay guys, even and odd.\n\n610\n00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.983\nIf it's an even number that ends in 0,\nit's a subnet.\n\n611\n00:27:48.983 --> 00:27:50.167\n>> Right.\n>> So this can't be right.\n\n612\n00:27:50.167 --> 00:27:51.930\nThis is a valid host.\n\n613\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.690\nIf it's an odd number that ends in 255,\nit's a broadcast.\n\n614\n00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.030\nSo that can't be right.\n\n615\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.070\nIf it's even number, not in 0, valid host.\n\n616\n00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.410\nOdd number, not with 255, valid host.\n\n617\n00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.608\nEven number, 0, subnet.\n\n618\n00:28:05.608 --> 00:28:06.653\n>> Okay.\n\n619\n00:28:06.653 --> 00:28:08.228\n>> Okay.\nEven and odd, even and odd.\n\n620\n00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:12.689\nAll right, which of the following IP\naddresses can be assigned to host devices?\n\n621\n00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.843\nThis one's a little bit tougher, isn't it?\n\n622\n00:28:16.843 --> 00:28:18.434\n>> Yeah.\n\n623\n00:28:18.434 --> 00:28:20.686\n>> Okay, so let's work through these.\n\n624\n00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:23.350\nThese are actually relatively simple,\nguys.\n\n625\n00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.040\nI don't care that they're Class A,B, or C.\n\n626\n00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.850\nLet's take out the wrong answers.\n\n627\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.633\nFirst off, 127.0.0.1?\n\n628\n00:28:28.633 --> 00:28:29.481\nNo.\n\n629\n00:28:29.481 --> 00:28:30.201\n224?\n\n630\n00:28:30.201 --> 00:28:31.374\nMulticast.\n\n631\n00:28:31.374 --> 00:28:32.360\nOkay, we've got those gone.\n\n632\n00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.080\nLet's look at the first one.\n\n633\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:39.291\nThis is a /27 with a 224 mask,\nwhich is a block size of 32.\n\n634\n00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:40.325\nThis is a subnet.\n\n635\n00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:41.473\nThat's not right.\n\n636\n00:28:41.473 --> 00:28:45.570\n10.2, not an even number,\nthat's a /23, isn't it?\n\n637\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.650\nEven and odd.\n\n638\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.458\nEven number, doesn't end in 0,\nthat's a good address.\n\n639\n00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:56.420\n45.47, right, doesn't seem necessarily\nbad at first until you see this.\n\n640\n00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:04.450\n/28 is a 240 mask with a block size of 16,\n0, 16, 32, 48, whoops, that's a broadcast.\n\n641\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:09.732\nAnd then 13, 248.0.0.\n\n642\n00:29:09.732 --> 00:29:11.196\nI don't care that I'm the second octet.\n\n643\n00:29:11.196 --> 00:29:12.430\nDon't get freaked out.\n\n644\n00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.070\nMy block size in the second octet is 8.\n\n645\n00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.222\nSo 0, 8, there's a 10, 0, 8, 16.\n\n646\n00:29:18.222 --> 00:29:23.140\nThis is in the 10.8.0.0 subnet.\n\n647\n00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:28.085\nMy next subnet is 10.16,\nso this is a 10.285.\n\n648\n00:29:28.085 --> 00:29:32.762\nI'm Sorry.\n10.15.255.255.\n\n649\n00:29:32.762 --> 00:29:36.275\nBecause it doesn't matter that you're\nin the second, third, or fourth octet.\n\n650\n00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:37.315\nDon't get freaked out.\n\n651\n00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:38.255\nLook at your block size.\n\n652\n00:29:38.255 --> 00:29:40.305\nI have a block of 8 in the second octet.\n\n653\n00:29:40.305 --> 00:29:41.650\nBig deal, that's easy.\n\n654\n00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:43.735\n0, 8, 16, we were 10.\n\n655\n00:29:43.735 --> 00:29:48.245\nSubnet 8, next subnet 16, so\nI put a 15 down there and add.\n\n656\n00:29:48.245 --> 00:29:50.807\n.0.0 and at 255.255.\n\n657\n00:29:54.476 --> 00:29:55.706\nWhich two statements describe?\n\n658\n00:29:55.706 --> 00:29:58.210\nOkay, again, /23 guys.\n\n659\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.939\nThis is gonna take a minute to work\nthrough because you're doing it for\n\n660\n00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:02.833\nthe first time.\n\n661\n00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:09.805\nNow /23 is a .254 mask in the fourth\noctet, which is a block size of 2.\n\n662\n00:30:09.805 --> 00:30:12.040\nOkay, I have a .65.\n\n663\n00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.674\nI'm pretty sure you guys can\nsee that we're in the 3.,\n\n664\n00:30:15.674 --> 00:30:20.166\nit's actually, let me write it over here,\n16.3.64 subnet.\n\n665\n00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:23.510\nI think you'd all agree with that.\n\n666\n00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:30.917\nThe subnet address is 10.3.0.254,\n253, whoops.\n\n667\n00:30:30.917 --> 00:30:33.882\nIt is 3.0.254.0.\n\n668\n00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.410\nWell, that's not right.\n\n669\n00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:41.326\nThe lowest host address in\nthe subnet is 2.1, right?\n\n670\n00:30:41.326 --> 00:30:43.010\nSo he's 3.65.\n\n671\n00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:48.203\nHold on, guys, 3.64 can't be a subnet,\nit's 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\n672\n00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:50.582\nSo what subnet is this guy in?\n\n673\n00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:51.465\nHold on, guys.\n\n674\n00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:55.268\nI've got to squeeze this,\nget rid of this, redo this.\n\n675\n00:30:55.268 --> 00:30:55.886\nOkay.\n\n676\n00:30:55.886 --> 00:31:00.616\nSo he's in the 10.16.024, so\n\n677\n00:31:00.616 --> 00:31:04.935\nhe's in the 2.0 subnet, right?\n\n678\n00:31:04.935 --> 00:31:06.874\nThe next subnet is 4.0.\n\n679\n00:31:06.874 --> 00:31:09.173\n3.65 is just a valid hosts within there.\n\n680\n00:31:09.173 --> 00:31:12.958\nSo 2.0, so the subnet address is not this.\n\n681\n00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:14.200\nIt's 2.0.\n\n682\n00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:19.198\nThe lowest host in the address is\nabsolutely 2.1 because the broadcast\n\n683\n00:31:19.198 --> 00:31:20.977\naddress is gonna be what?\n\n684\n00:31:20.977 --> 00:31:22.577\n3.255.\n\n685\n00:31:22.577 --> 00:31:26.050\nSo any number between\nthere is a valid host.\n\n686\n00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.890\nThe last valid host is 2.,\nno, that's not right.\n\n687\n00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.750\nThe broadcast address is 3.2,\nthat's correct.\n\n688\n00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.430\nSo we got A and D, and\nthe network is not subnetted is incorrect.\n\n689\n00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.366\n0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the third octet.\n\n690\n00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:42.188\nI started doing it in the fourth octet for\nwhatever reason, but\n\n691\n00:31:42.188 --> 00:31:44.885\nthe fact is that in the third\noctet we have a block size of 2.\n\n692\n00:31:44.885 --> 00:31:47.096\n2.0 was our subnet.\n\n693\n00:31:47.096 --> 00:31:48.976\nFind the valid host here, Ronnie.\n\n694\n00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:51.256\nNow you're gonna get something like this.\n\n695\n00:31:51.256 --> 00:31:54.623\nI get emails from people, I put this in\nmy book, and people go you're stupid,\n\n696\n00:31:54.623 --> 00:31:57.190\nyou're all these things, and\nthat's probably all true.\n\n697\n00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.770\nBut the fact is,\nbecause I write to say, hey,\n\n698\n00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.850\nyou have this subnet on this interface.\n\n699\n00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.900\nAnd they're gonna write and go,\nwhat's the matter with you?\n\n700\n00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.940\nThat's not a subnet.\n\n701\n00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.860\nIt's true guys, I write for\nthe objectives.\n\n702\n00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.850\nI write so you get used to the questions.\n\n703\n00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.909\nAll right?\nSo I don't make this stuff up.\n\n704\n00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:14.581\nI don't, I really don't.\n\n705\n00:32:14.581 --> 00:32:15.730\nSometimes, actually.\n\n706\n00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.402\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But not usually.\n\n707\n00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:18.807\nI'm not making this one up.\n\n708\n00:32:18.807 --> 00:32:22.290\n172.16.17.0/22.\n\n709\n00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.530\nI think everyone would know that's\nactually not a subnet address.\n\n710\n00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.640\nThat is a valid host on this.\n\n711\n00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.422\nSo what is the valid\nsubnet address on here?\n\n712\n00:32:30.422 --> 00:32:33.801\n172.16.17.0/22.\n\n713\n00:32:33.801 --> 00:32:37.968\nFirst off, you can't answer this question\nif you don't know what a /22 is.\n\n714\n00:32:37.968 --> 00:32:40.883\n255.255-\n>> 252.\n\n715\n00:32:40.883 --> 00:32:43.867\n>> It is 252.0, right?\n\n716\n00:32:43.867 --> 00:32:46.890\nDefinitely, that means we have\na block size of four here.\n\n717\n00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.769\nSo that tells me I'm in the 172.16.\n\n718\n00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:50.454\nWhat?\n\n719\n00:32:50.454 --> 00:32:51.151\n>> 16.\n\n720\n00:32:51.151 --> 00:32:53.680\n>> Yeah, 16.0 subnet.\n\n721\n00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.030\nAbsolutely, that's what we're in.\n\n722\n00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.720\nIs 17.0 a valid host?\n\n723\n00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.476\nIt is, and if the question says, hey,\n\n724\n00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:02.122\nyou have this subnet on that interface\nare you gonna go, Todd's so stupid?\n\n725\n00:33:02.122 --> 00:33:03.700\nYes, you probably will.\n\n726\n00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.280\nBut the fact is,\nis it doesn't matter, guys.\n\n727\n00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.070\nLook at the question.\n\n728\n00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.880\nTry to understand what I'm saying.\n\n729\n00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.560\nBecause you have to\nread between the lines.\n\n730\n00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.384\nHere, and I'm trying to prepare you for\nthe real-life objectives.\n\n731\n00:33:13.384 --> 00:33:17.007\nAll right,\nthat means that 172.16.16.0 is my subnet.\n\n732\n00:33:17.007 --> 00:33:19.305\nThe next subnet is what?\n\n733\n00:33:19.305 --> 00:33:20.300\n>> Should be 18.\n\n734\n00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.110\n>> No, no, no.\n\n735\n00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.985\nBlock size of 4.\n\n736\n00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:23.261\nSo it'll be 19.255,\n\n737\n00:33:23.261 --> 00:33:24.923\nbecause the next subnet's-\n>> 20.\n\n738\n00:33:24.923 --> 00:33:26.168\n>> 20.0.\n\n739\n00:33:26.168 --> 00:33:30.370\nSo my valid host's 16.1 through 19.254.\n\n740\n00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.390\n>> All right.\n\n741\n00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:39.913\n>> Okay, what is the subnet\naddress of 172.16.159.159/22?\n\n742\n00:33:39.913 --> 00:33:41.585\nAgain, same mass though isn't it?\n\n743\n00:33:41.585 --> 00:33:47.285\nSo it's basically a 255.255.252.0.\n\n744\n00:33:47.285 --> 00:33:48.800\nThis is a block size of 4, so\n\n745\n00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.274\nI think that you guys should be\nable to look at this and determine,\n\n746\n00:33:52.274 --> 00:33:56.370\nmaybe not what the first subnet is but\nwhat's the next subnet, right?\n\n747\n00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:00.710\nIf it's 159, I bet you money\nmy next subnet would be 160.0.\n\n748\n00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.030\nWhich would make this subnet then, what?\n\n749\n00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.563\n156.0.\n\n750\n00:34:05.563 --> 00:34:09.119\nSo, my broadcast address would be 159.255.\n\n751\n00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:14.660\nNow, I just go through here and it's just\nasking what the subnet is, which is 156.0.\n\n752\n00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.175\nIf it was asking for the valid host,\nI write that down or\n\n753\n00:34:17.175 --> 00:34:19.593\nI think about it in my head,\nI can see that in my head.\n\n754\n00:34:19.593 --> 00:34:21.114\nAnd I just pick out\nthe numbers in between.\n\n755\n00:34:24.168 --> 00:34:28.745\nA host on a network has\nthe address 172.16.45.14/30,\n\n756\n00:34:28.745 --> 00:34:31.428\nit doesn't get any easier than this one.\n\n757\n00:34:31.428 --> 00:34:38.766\nAll right,\n/30 is a 252 mask in the fourth octet.\n\n758\n00:34:38.766 --> 00:34:44.420\nSo, it's a block size of 4, 0,\n4, 8, 12 in the fourth octet.\n\n759\n00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.130\nNext subnet's 16, so I broadcast 15.\n\n760\n00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.278\nThis is a class B.\n\n761\n00:34:47.278 --> 00:34:50.418\nSo really, it's 45.12,\nright, is technically.\n\n762\n00:34:50.418 --> 00:34:57.050\nAnd so, 45.15 would be my subnet.\n\n763\n00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.980\nOkay, so 45.12, where is it?\n\n764\n00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.050\nThere it is,\nthere's my answer right there.\n\n765\n00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.280\nAlmost done guys.\n\n766\n00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.927\nNow, you might be thinking, well,\nhe's going through it so fast.\n\n767\n00:35:04.927 --> 00:35:06.955\nThat's true, but they get to rewind this.\n\n768\n00:35:06.955 --> 00:35:08.690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n769\n00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.225\n>> And what is the IP address,\nwhich IP addresses are valid for\n\n770\n00:35:13.225 --> 00:35:17.503\nhosts belonging to the 10.1.160.0/20?\n\n771\n00:35:17.503 --> 00:35:21.740\nCisco loves their /20s, their /12s, /20s,\n\n772\n00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.897\n/28s because that's why\nwe have to count by 16s.\n\n773\n00:35:25.897 --> 00:35:28.161\nActually, they're giving\nme the subnet number here.\n\n774\n00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:30.541\nThis is pretty easy, 160.0.\n\n775\n00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:37.417\nI count by 16s, 176 .0,\nand so it's 175.255.\n\n776\n00:35:37.417 --> 00:35:40.265\nSo this question asks, hey man,\n\n777\n00:35:40.265 --> 00:35:46.290\ncan you pick out the numbers\nbetween 176.0 and 175.255?\n\n778\n00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.554\nThat is all they're asking.\n\n779\n00:35:47.554 --> 00:35:48.580\nSo, what do we think here?\n\n780\n00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:52.015\nThis one works.\n\n781\n00:35:52.015 --> 00:35:53.925\nNo, this is too high.\n\n782\n00:35:53.925 --> 00:35:57.250\n>> Yep, [CROSSTALK]\n>> That is, okay.\n\n783\n00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.445\nThat's ok, 160.0.\n\n784\n00:35:59.445 --> 00:36:00.769\nThat's okay.\n\n785\n00:36:00.769 --> 00:36:04.440\n160.0 is my subnet and\n175.285 is my broadcast.\n\n786\n00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.652\nBada bing bada boom, right?\n\n787\n00:36:05.652 --> 00:36:08.840\nSo, now we just pick out the valid\nhost once we know our range.\n\n788\n00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.970\nNow you guys are really getting the idea\nof the CCENT subnetting objectives.\n\n789\n00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.220\nLet me tell you, you are.\n\n790\n00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.320\nWhat is a, okay,\n[LAUGH] this is a good one.\n\n791\n00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.490\nWhat is the maximum number of bits that\ncan be borrowed to create a

right?\n\n832\n00:38:15.178 --> 00:38:18.301\nWhich one of the following IP addresses\n\n833\n00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:23.037\nis the last valid host in\nthe subnet using it's a /127?\n\n834\n00:38:23.037 --> 00:38:26.614\nSo, what do we have to be able to count\nby Ronnie, to be able to answer this?\n\n835\n00:38:26.614 --> 00:38:27.136\n>> 32.\n\n836\n00:38:27.136 --> 00:38:27.937\n>> 32.\n\n837\n00:38:27.937 --> 00:38:33.057\nA 224, right,\n/27 block size of 32, 032, 64.\n\n838\n00:38:33.057 --> 00:38:36.029\nSo I can look a this, guys, and\nimmediately know that's a broadcast.\n\n839\n00:38:36.029 --> 00:38:37.237\nThat's a valid host.\n\n840\n00:38:37.237 --> 00:38:38.375\nThat's a valid host.\n\n841\n00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:42.000\nThat's a valid host, and\nthat's a subnet, right?\n\n842\n00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.904\nSo, following IP addresses,\nthe last valid host, so I'm looking,\n\n843\n00:38:45.904 --> 00:38:48.168\nthose are my last valid host in this one.\n\n844\n00:38:48.168 --> 00:38:52.230\n62 is my last valid host in the 32 subnet.\n\n845\n00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.945\nAnd 63's my broadcast, right,\nso I had three to pick from.\n\n846\n00:38:55.945 --> 00:38:58.842\n[LAUGH] And lastly guys,\njust to pick on you guys,\n\n847\n00:38:58.842 --> 00:39:03.060\nor pick on Ronnie from yesterday,\nRFC 1918 is the last slide.\n\n848\n00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.880\nAnd now you guys have the full\nIP subnetting CCENT objectives.\n\n849\n00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.110\nIf you used yesterday's video and this\none, too, you guys will be good to go.\n\n850\n00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.985\nWell, it would help, don't forget to\nbuy my book and read that chapter, too.\n\n851\n00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wait, you can't just watch the video,\n\n852\n00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.125\nyou gotta buy my book and\ncome to my class, right?\n\n853\n00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:22.100\n[LAUGH] RFC 1918, Ron, what do you think?\n\n854\n00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.350\nWhich are private?\n\n855\n00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.536\n>> The 10 and the-\n>> That's it, right?\n\n856\n00:39:26.536 --> 00:39:29.393\n>> Yeah, that's it, yep.\n>> So we got class A, 10.\n\n857\n00:39:29.393 --> 00:39:33.021\nB, 172.16 through .31 and\n\n858\n00:39:33.021 --> 00:39:37.595\nC anything that starts with 192.168.\n\n859\n00:39:37.595 --> 00:39:41.075\nAll right guys,\nif you're following along with Lammle.com,\n\n860\n00:39:41.075 --> 00:39:43.080\nthere's practice test questions.\n\n861\n00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.740\nWe went through, what did we do yesterday?\n\n862\n00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.852\nInternetworking, ethernet,\nTCP/IP Easy subnetting, right,\n\n863\n00:39:48.852 --> 00:39:51.820\nand then we're still on subnetting today.\n\n864\n00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.900\nSo, we can finish off our\nsubnetting section, so\n\n865\n00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.770\nwe've got five practice\ntest banks on Lammle.com.\n\n866\n00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.560\nIt is a membership, just FYI.\n\n867\n00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.830\nThe other thing is, if you have my new\nbook, then it's going to be Chapter 4, so\n\n868\n00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.220\nwe have covered through\nChapter 4 of my new book.\n\n869\n00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.930\nWe're going along.\n\n870\n00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.000\nIf you haven't joined us yesterday,\nwe're using the new videos.\n\n871\n00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.120\nWe're just going allowing\nfollowing those step-by-step.\n\n872\n00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.250\nSo now, we're through Chapter 4,\nthrough all the review questions.\n\n873\n00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.200\nThrough all the written labs in my book.\n\n874\n00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.520\nAs well as, if you are on Lammle.com,\n\n875\n00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.640\nthen you can add those\npractice questions in there.\n\n876\n00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.380\nOkay, Ronny?\n\n877\n00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:28.129\n>> All right, Todd, somebody asked,\nwhat is the title of the book here?\n\n878\n00:40:28.129 --> 00:40:30.998\n>> Well, it would be ICND1.\n\n879\n00:40:30.998 --> 00:40:31.695\nWhat's the new test number?\n\n880\n00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:32.762\nI forget.\n100-105.\n\n881\n00:40:32.762 --> 00:40:34.678\n>> 100-105.\n\n882\n00:40:34.678 --> 00:40:37.610\n>> All right, so\nit will be on Sybex today or tomorrow.\n\n883\n00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.280\nNot Sybex, on Amazon today or tomorrow.\n\n884\n00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.067\nBut my old book, at this point here,\n\n885\n00:40:42.067 --> 00:40:45.421\nwe haven't done anything that isn't\nin my old book as well, right?\n\n886\n00:40:45.421 --> 00:40:48.760\nSo it's ICND1 or called CCENT.\n\n887\n00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.380\nAnd next week, we'll be doing live,\nICND2, so make sure and stick around.\n\n888\n00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.160\n>> All right, Todd, well thank you again\nfor reminding us about subnetting here.\n\n889\n00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.660\nAnd especially remembering the ideas that,\nin getting ready for\n\n890\n00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.480\nthe exam,\nknowing the fundamentals is okay.\n\n891\n00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.510\nBut the key here is\ngetting quick at it and\n\n892\n00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.960\nbeing accurate at being\nable to do subnetting.\n\n893\n00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.155\nAnd the way that Todd described it is, you\nneed to be able to do it in your head and\n\n894\n00:41:12.155 --> 00:41:14.143\nnot take a lot of time doing it at all.\n\n895\n00:41:14.143 --> 00:41:17.734\nSo in that fact, if you don't have\nconfidence that you can do that,\n\n896\n00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:19.440\nit means more practice for you.\n\n897\n00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.350\nIt means more chance for you to actually\ntake advantage of Todd's book that's\n\n898\n00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:27.430\njust gonna be out in a day, maybe\nactually even today, for all we know.\n\n899\n00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.437\nAnd take advantage of that, as well.\n\n900\n00:41:29.437 --> 00:41:34.213\nBut, getting the skills down, and knowing\nthe accuracy, and knowing the timing here,\n\n901\n00:41:34.213 --> 00:41:37.790\nthat's gonna be a key to the exam and\nyou getting by that, as well.\n\n902\n00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.568\nSo, that's a great place for\n\n903\n00:41:39.568 --> 00:41:43.520\nus to actually finish off that\nidea of subnetting today.\n\n904\n00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.540\nThank you for joining us.\n\n905\n00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.799\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Long.\n\n906\n00:41:48.799 --> 00:41:51.680\n>> And thank you for\njoining us, subnetting is fun.\n\n907\n00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.818\nThis is fun, right Ronnie?\n\n908\n00:41:52.818 --> 00:41:53.758\n>> It is!\n>> It's fun.\n\n909\n00:41:53.758 --> 00:41:55.384\nStick around, what have we got coming up?\n\n910\n00:41:55.384 --> 00:41:57.497\nVLSM and summarization my friends.\n\n911\n00:41:57.497 --> 00:42:01.177\n>> All right, so\nstay tuned right here for more CCENT.\n\n912\n00:42:01.177 --> 00:42:09.350\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "description": "In this episode, Todd Lammle introduces to the IPv6 address characteristics.  Unlike IPv4, there are many different types of addresses: link local addresses, unique-local, unique global addresses.  The address space is a 128 bit in size.  It’s function though is analogous to that of IPv4 addresses but it does it differently, easier and better because of it’s design.  IPv6 addresses are either stateless or stateful.  Stateless addresses are auto configured and stateful addresses will be assigned through DHCPv.6.  In stateful addressing the advertisement is from the dhcp server using imcp 134 on ff02::1,   if stateless then the advertisement is from the client on ff02::2 on ICMP 133",

00:00:19.407\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're taking away that ICND1 content.\n\n4\n00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:22.972\nWe're getting ready for that new exam\nthat Cisco has just released, and\n\n5\n00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.620\nto help us out here today is gonna be Mr.\nTodd Lammie.\n\n6\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.810\nWelcome back to our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.460\n>> Thank you, it's good to be here again.\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.950\nWe're gonna start with,\n\n9\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.190\nthere's two sections of IPv6,\nwe're gonna do just foundational stuff.\n\n10\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.560\nMost of your objectives are covered here,\n\n11\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.460\nbut we're gonna hit\nthe configuration as well.\n\n12\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.710\nIn the configuration, the objectives are\na little bit different than the last one.\n\n13\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.890\nWe only have static NAT which\ndoesn't make it really any easier.\n\n14\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410\nBefore it was RIP ng, I think.\n\n15\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.490\nAnd I think actually I did OSPFv3 as well,\nand we're gonna hit that next week.\n\n16\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.910\nWe will do that in the ICD2, but in\nthe CSET we just have static and dynamic.\n\n17\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.790\nBut let's hit some foundation right now,\nshow you some objectives.\n\n18\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.990\nOkay, let's take a look.\n\n19\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.620\nSo to extend the lifetime and\nusefulness of IPv4,\n\n20\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.010\nwe came up with CIDR, which is our slash\nnotations handing out small blocks to\n\n21\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.540\nusers instead of whole classes of address.\n\n22\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.720\nVLSM, DHCP would help us,\nI guess, to hand out addresses.\n\n23\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.881\nAnd then of course, NAT helped\nextend the life of IPv4 for sure.\n\n24\n00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.479\nI wish they wouldn't have\ncame out with NAT overload,\n\n25\n00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.400\nwe had to been in IPv6 ten\nyears ago at least, right.\n\n26\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.940\nSo the problem's NAT breaks\nthe end to end model of IP.\n\n27\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.830\nYou know, you gotta remember in 95 or\n96, I actually had customers and\n\n28\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.510\nthey actually had IP\naddresses on their host.\n\n29\n00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.530\nMost of the schools,\n\n30\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.840\nif not all the schools that I worked with,\nall had real IP addresses.\n\n31\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.091\nAnd so you could actually ping,\nit was very helpful, right,\n\n32\n00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.493\ncuz you could ping and troubleshoot.\n\n33\n00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:44.394\nI could dial up in the CompuServe,\nI forget what it was, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:47.671\ninto my bulletin board, and\nthen I can add ping and\n\n35\n00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.120\nTelnet into their devices\nfrom my home at that time.\n\n36\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.070\nAnd that made it a lot\neasier to troubleshoot.\n\n37\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.720\nAll right, but we can't do that any more.\n\n38\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.120\nRemember, some applications\nare not NAT friendly.\n\n39\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.195\nSo in other words, they're sitting there\nsaying, hey, we used to use NAT, but\n\n40\n00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:01.704\nnow NAT's terrible, let go to IPv6.\n\n41\n00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:07.180\nI agree, we don't need NAT with IPv6, not\nthe way we do our unicast routing here.\n\n42\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.150\nSo first off, IPv6 features, the benefits\nof IPv6 is a larger address space.\n\n43\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.583\nActually it's such a large address\nspace I don't even know how to name it.\n\n44\n00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:20.023\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now someone figured out,\n\n45\n00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:22.891\nthis is someone that had way\ntoo much time on their hand,\n\n46\n00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.130\nthat there are more IPv6 addresses than\nthere are grains of sand on the Earth.\n\n47\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.670\nAnd-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.808\n>> Wait, I'm not done.\n\n49\n00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:31.440\nAnd counting all the ants as well.\n\n50\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.300\nIf you take all the grains\nof sand on Earth, and\n\n51\n00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.870\nall the ants,\nwe still have more addresses.\n\n52\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.280\nDo you know when, though, I think we\ncould run out of addresses, though?\n\n53\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.950\nIf we get take over by another galaxy and\nthey have billions and\n\n54\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.770\nbillions of users, maybe trillions of\nusers, then maybe we'd be in trouble.\n\n55\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.189\nOther than that, we're okay.\n\n56\n00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.690\nNow, here's the deal about IPv4.\n\n57\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.440\nIt actually has about 4.3\nbillion addresses available.\n\n58\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.940\nHowever, they reserved literally\nabout 3 billion addresses.\n\n59\n00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.790\nSo, we only have 1.3 billion that are\navailable with IPv4, that was a problem.\n\n60\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.672\nBut, cuz an extra billion or\ntwo addresses would have helped.\n\n61\n00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:11.842\nThe other thing is that,\nit definitely has a simpler header.\n\n62\n00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:18.519\nIPv4 has a 20 byte header and IPv6 has\nonly the double the size of 40 bit header,\n\n63\n00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.580\nbut yet four times the length\nof the address field.\n\n64\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.400\nSecurity and mobility,\nnow there's some scopes in prefixes,\n\n65\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.770\nif we take a look at these.\n\n66\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.810\nFirst off, the Link Local for\n\n67\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.798\nIPv6, it's called Link Local,\nthat's the APIPA of the IPv6 world.\n\n68\n00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:40.897\nThese are called\nLink Local Unicast addresses.\n\n69\n00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:44.710\nWe gonna find out what they start with and\nyou're gonna memorize that, right?\n\n70\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.944\nSo then we have our private addresses,\n\n71\n00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:53.250\nthese are equivalent to RFC 1918,\nwith IPv4, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.510\nSo these are called site local or\nUnique Local Unicast Addresses, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.450\nSo Unique Local Unicast Addresses\nare equivalent to my private in IPv4.\n\n74\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.380\nThen to get onto the Internet, this is\nour Global, right, our global addresses.\n\n75\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.210\nThe same thing with IPv4,\nthese are called Global Unicast.\n\n76\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.312\nSo notice now in IPv4 we only had\none Unicast Address on our NIC.\n\n77\n00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:24.130\nIn IPv6, we're gonna have multiple Unicast\nAddresses plus a loopback interface.\n\n78\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.120\nAll right, so each one, lots of them.\n\n79\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.297\nNow IPv6 address types, we have Unicast\nwhich is a one-to-one translation,\n\n80\n00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:34.820\na one-to-one translation, right?\n\n81\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.810\nThese are the same.\n\n82\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.450\nWith Multicast it's one-to-many,\none-to-many translation.\n\n83\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.020\nWith Anycast it's,\nnow Anycast is important here.\n\n84\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.360\nIt's one-to-nearest.\n\n85\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.060\nNow most people haven't heard of Anycast,\nbut it's been around for a long time.\n\n86\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.140\nFor example, if you have ever used 8.8.8.8\nor 4.4.4.4 for Google DNS servers,\n\n87\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.578\nwhat, you think there's only one little\nserver sitting around somewhere?\n\n88\n00:04:57.578 --> 00:05:00.470\nThere's dozens or maybe hundreds of these,\n\n89\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.850\na virtual machine sitting somewhere\nin the world responding to that.\n\n90\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.312\nSo that's an Anycast IPv4.\n\n91\n00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:10.030\nWith IPv6, it's just more prevalent and\nit's easy to use.\n\n92\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.730\nIt's one in there, it's good for contents.\n\n93\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.330\nSo basically what we do is create\na Unicast address the same\n\n94\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.880\non all of these servers, and\n\n95\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.570\nthen the router that's closest to\nit would respond to that server.\n\n96\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.979\nSo that's why Anycast address,\none-to-nearest,\n\n97\n00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.590\none-to-nearest, no broadcast.\n\n98\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.440\nSo, that's the key.\n\n99\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.170\nWe no longer have any broadcast addresses.\n\n100\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.557\nAll right, so that makes applications\na little more difficult here.\n\n101\n00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:37.962\nNow, what we need to remember about\nIPv6 is that there's eight fields,\n\n102\n00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.630\nokay, eight fields.\n\n103\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.182\nSo, this is eight fields here,\nOf 16 bits each.\n\n104\n00:05:46.182 --> 00:05:51.355\nSo there is four hex characters, and\na hex character is a nibble or four bits.\n\n105\n00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:56.180\nAll right, so\nin each of these fields is 16 bits, right.\n\n106\n00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.987\nSo, if someone ask you, how many bits\nare in an IPv6 field, the answer is 16,\n\n107\n00:06:00.987 --> 00:06:04.770\nalthough you're gonna wanna pick 128 bits,\naren't you?\n\n108\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.090\nThat's an IPv6 address.\n\n109\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.350\nIn the field, then we only have 16 bits.\n\n110\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.510\nSo the hexadecimal field\nwill look like this.\n\n111\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.761\nThe 2001 ODB8.\n\n112\n00:06:14.761 --> 00:06:17.724\nNow this is reserved, I use this in my\nbooks, I'm using it in my presentations,\n\n113\n00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:18.820\nthis address here.\n\n114\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.310\nThis address here is reserved for\ndocumentation,\n\n115\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.980\nwhich is why I use it, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.451\nSo then this here, now what size and\nwe're gonna see on the next slide here,\n\n117\n00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:29.109\nthat we have the network host\nportion just like IPv4, but\n\n118\n00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:30.920\nwe don't have the different classes.\n\n119\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.775\nIt's all one thing,\nwe'll take a look here.\n\n120\n00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:36.589\nOkay, so here's my example here, and\nnotice I have all these zeros in here,\n\n121\n00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.420\nright, so\nthat's kind of a long address,128 bits.\n\n122\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.400\nThere's 8 fields of 16 bits here, right.\n\n123\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.600\nBut I don't need to put in my\nleading zeros, so I can do 2001 DB8.\n\n124\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.981\nSo notice I got rid of that zero.\n\n125\n00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:53.946\n10F:1 and then I can represent each\nsuccessive field of zeros as a colon,\n\n126\n00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:59.446\nor if I have bunch in a row, I'm going\nto put in a double colon like this,\n\n127\n00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:05.460\nand that's going to represent from the 1\nall the way to this A, is all zeros.\n\n128\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.890\nNow I can only have one double\ncolon per address, right,\n\n129\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.230\nbut this allows me to,\nlook how short this address got.\n\n130\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.985\nIt's almost readable now.\n\n131\n00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:17.003\n[LAUGH] Now at first when you're looking\nat IPv6, you're sitting here looking at\n\n132\n00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:20.148\nthis, and you're looking at\nthis large address saying, man,\n\n133\n00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.380\nthat's rough, I don't know how to do this.\n\n134\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.400\nWell, copy and paste is your friend, so\n\n135\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.820\nI was doing some labs last night,\nand I'd just copy paste in.\n\n136\n00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.900\nWhen you ping, copy paste.\n\n137\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.180\nGone is the days where you just\ntype in the IP address, right.\n\n138\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.120\nAnyways, so notice that one of\nthe things you're gonna look\n\n139\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.710\nat when you're looking for wrong\naddresses, cuz the objectives might come,\n\n140\n00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.350\nwhich one of these one of\nthese IPv6 addresses is valid?\n\n141\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.210\nAll you're gonna look for\nis something that's not in the fields.\n\n142\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.418\nSo in another words, my hex characters,\nas you guys already know,\n\n143\n00:07:48.418 --> 00:07:51.249\nwe already talked about this,\n0 through 9, A through F.\n\n144\n00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:52.844\nSo if you see something has a G or W or\n\n145\n00:07:52.844 --> 00:07:56.584\nsomething like that you know it's a bad\naddress, or if it has two double colons,\n\n146\n00:07:56.584 --> 00:07:58.961\nfor example, or\nif it doesn't have eight fields.\n\n147\n00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:01.272\nNow if it has six fields but\nhas a double colon,\n\n148\n00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:05.015\nthen you're okay because that's gonna\nfill in all that space with zeros.\n\n149\n00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.810\nNow let's take a look at this, guys.\n\n150\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.230\nThis is my IPv6 Unicast address here and\nI have multiple different types of them.\n\n151\n00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.510\nBut notice it's right down the middle\nhere, 64 bits on each side, 64 bits for\n\n152\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.230\nthe network ID, 64 bits for the host.\n\n153\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.590\nSee, that doesn't change.\n\n154\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.600\nIn IPv4, you have class A, B and\nwe don't have any of that here.\n\n155\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.580\nPretty simple here,\nno broadcast, we don't need DHCP.\n\n156\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.761\nYou can use it,\nit does auto-configuration.\n\n157\n00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:32.870\nIt's considered plug and\nplay for the host, right?\n\n158\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.570\nSo, we will probably still use\nDHCP cuz if you think about it,\n\n159\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.970\nI might make up an address.\n\n160\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.450\nThat's fine, that's probably\ntypically the way we're gonna do it.\n\n161\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.060\nBut don't I still need to get my\nDNS server, maybe my Option 66 or\n\n162\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.750\nsomething like that?\n\n163\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.350\nWe need to remember what Option 66 is.\n\n164\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.675\nYou don't know what DHCP Option 66 is,\nyou gonna go back to my book and\n\n165\n00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:52.190\ninto this video here.\n\n166\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.256\nCCNA objectives, CCNA objectives.\n\n167\n00:08:54.256 --> 00:08:57.980\nSo here's an example of an IPv4\nnetwork address, right?\n\n168\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.310\nIt's a class B network address and all the\nzeros here in host bits, they're all off.\n\n169\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.410\nThat represents my network.\n\n170\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.080\nThey all on will represent\nmy broadcast address.\n\n171\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.712\nI don't have that with IPv6 cuz we\ndon't have any broadcasts, right?\n\n172\n00:09:11.712 --> 00:09:12.700\nBut nonetheless,\n\n173\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.210\nwe still represent the network address\nwith all my host bits off, right?\n\n174\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.430\nThat's my network address.\n\n175\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.950\nBut I can assign, as you'll see, when we\nget to the next section in this episode,\n\n176\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.190\nthat I can assign a network address, with\nno host bits on, to a router interface.\n\n177\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.280\nThe router then will take that, assign\nitself an iPv6 address, then advertise\n\n178\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.570\nthat network address to all the other\nhosts which auto-configure themselves.\n\n179\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.710\nIt's plug and play, right?\n\n180\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.500\nYou just have to configure your router,\nmakes it really easy.\n\n181\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.305\nNo NAT, no subnetting.\n\n182\n00:09:41.305 --> 00:09:43.448\nMy gosh, yeah, now we like IPv6 right?\n\n183\n00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:45.538\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, repeat after me.\n\n184\n00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:47.710\nIPv6 is my friend.\n\n185\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.253\n>> IPv6 is my friend.\n\n186\n00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:51.610\n>> It is, plug and play, no subnetting.\n\n187\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.070\nWe don't need DHCP\nalthough you can use it.\n\n188\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.940\nNo NAT, right?\n\n189\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.060\nNo broadcast, plug and\nplay, piece of cake.\n\n190\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.150\nAll right, now [COUGH] here's\nmy IPv6 network example.\n\n191\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.214\nNotice I have 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n192\n00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:08.380\nNow, I said no subnetting.\n\n193\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.045\nAnd I'm gonna write here,\nthis is my subnet.\n\n194\n00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:13.595\nHowever, it's just some\nrandom number you make up.\n\n195\n00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:15.145\nSo, typically, I add that 16-bit field.\n\n196\n00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:17.745\nI start with 1, 2, 3, 4, right?\n\n197\n00:10:17.745 --> 00:10:20.075\nSo, at 16 bits, what's 2 to the 16th?\n\n198\n00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:21.095\nIt's 65,000.\n\n199\n00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:27.015\nSo I can have 65,000 router interfaces\njust with this one prefix here, right?\n\n200\n00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:29.590\nSo I get this prefix from Miana or\nactually from my ISP,\n\n201\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.355\nwith they get it from Miana.\n\n202\n00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:32.175\nThey're gonna give me this prefix.\n\n203\n00:10:32.175 --> 00:10:34.610\nI'll make up that fourth field.\n\n204\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.710\nOne for each router interface which gives\nme my link equivalent to my subnet, right?\n\n205\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.510\nEquivalent to my subnet,\nI just have IP version 4.\n\n206\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.730\nAnd then I'm sitting\nhere saying right here,\n\n207\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.410\nsee these double colons that's saying.\n\n208\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.390\nAnd the host address is all zeroes, right?\n\n209\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.580\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nI don't have to do it like this.\n\n210\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.676\nI can do like ::1 at the end, right.\n\n211\n00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:54.430\n::2 at the end or something like that.\n\n212\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.320\nBut I'd have to make this unique for each\nrouter interface here and then do ::1 or\n\n213\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.430\nsomething like that.\n\n214\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.630\nAnd then I do /64.\n\n215\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.520\nSo I'm saying at this point here,\nif I check this in,\n\n216\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.940\nwhich I can do, I can then send this out.\n\n217\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.150\nThe host will just make up an address,\nrandomly just make it up.\n\n218\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.450\nWell, couldn't it just get the same\naddress as one of the hosts,\n\n219\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.140\nthe other hosts on that link?\n\n220\n00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.020\nYou know what the odds are?\n\n221\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.970\nThey said that,\nif you had a 300 yard hole in golf and\n\n222\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:29.700\nyou did a 100 balls and you hit it for\n300 yards for 100 times and\n\n223\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.460\nyou got a whole in one every time,\nyou still wouldn't get a duplicate here.\n\n224\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.810\nWhat are the odds of\nhitting a hole in one?\n\n225\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.550\n>> Very hard.\n\n226\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.900\n>> Yeah,\nthe first time had to load a 100 in a row.\n\n227\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.210\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n228\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.910\n>> Those are some pretty,\n\n229\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.440\nbut I'll tell you when we get to the next\nepisode how it holds that regardless.\n\n230\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.030\nNow, my loopback example with\nIP version 4, 127.0.0.1,\n\n231\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.308\nmy equivalent loopback with IP version 6,\nvery simple ::1,\n\n232\n00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:57.921\n127.0.0.1, pretty close to this, right?\n\n233\n00:11:57.921 --> 00:12:01.550\n[LAUGH] 127 bits off and then a 1.\n\n234\n00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.150\nSo pretty cool and that's my loopback.\n\n235\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.150\nRemember I'm gonna have multiple Unicast\nAddresses on my interface plus a loopback.\n\n236\n00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.290\nEvery interface will\nhave this ::1 on there.\n\n237\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.440\nThe Link Local Unicast Address,\nthis is important here.\n\n238\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.980\nWhoops.\n\n239\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.230\nThis is my Apipa right?\n\n240\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.570\nI think that's how you spell that.\n\n241\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.170\nCheck this out.\n\n242\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.110\nSo this is my link local.\n\n243\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.810\nSo we have a link local, that Apipa,\nthat 169254 the IP version 4,\n\n244\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.420\nremember I can only have one\naddress on my IP version 4 neck.\n\n245\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.868\nNow, in this case here,\nI can have multiple addresses.\n\n246\n00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:41.290\nSo I'm gonna have a link local that\ncommunicates from my host to my routers.\n\n247\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.930\nBut not only that.\n\n248\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.770\nIf I had two routers.\n\n249\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.560\nAnd they were running,\nI don't RIP MG or OSPFv3, whatever.\n\n250\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.120\nThey're gonna communicate\nusing the link local address.\n\n251\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.440\nSo for you to actually talk\nfrom your host to the router,\n\n252\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.920\nyou use a link local address.\n\n253\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.990\nNow you might have another address\nuntil that says I wanna get onto\n\n254\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.270\nthe Internet, right.\n\n255\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.410\nSo I'm gonna have my global address for\nthat.\n\n256\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.760\nBut for me to talk locally we\nuse that link local address.\n\n257\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.190\nNow remember I'm gonna go out and look.\n\n258\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.760\nIf I did an IP config all.\n\n259\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.280\nAnd we did that a couple days ago but you\ncan go to your host do an IP config all,\n\n260\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.520\nyou're gonna see that you\nhave a link local address.\n\n261\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.947\nAnd it starts with FE80, now ::/10.\n\n262\n00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:19.295\nNow you're like, what is this slash?\n\n263\n00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.540\nI thought there was no mask.\n\n264\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.280\nThere isn't.\n\n265\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.730\nWhat this is saying is how many bits in\nthe header of this address define it,\n\n266\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.110\nthat are important to define it.\n\n267\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.020\nSo it's saying 10 bits to define it.\n\n268\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.470\nLook at this, this is an F, isn't it?\n\n269\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:35.960\nThis is an E, and then out of the next\nnibble, we've got an 8 bit on.\n\n270\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.198\nSo that's FE80, right.\n\n271\n00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:42.500\nSo the first 10 bits to find\nthis link local, right?\n\n272\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:49.170\nWith the Global Unicast Address,\nthese start at 2000::3, so\n\n273\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.000\nthe first 3 bits define the global prefix,\nright.\n\n274\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.020\nThis is going to tell me that this is\nthe address that I'm going to use to get\n\n275\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.080\nonto the Internet.\n\n276\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.169\nSo again, I'll see this as 2000::/3.\n\n277\n00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:03.283\nThat's what I start with.\n\n278\n00:14:03.283 --> 00:14:05.629\nIt goes up to 3e, I forget what it is.\n\n279\n00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:07.626\n3eff or something like that.\n\n280\n00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:08.566\nNow there's something else.\n\n281\n00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:11.290\nThis is my equivalent to my private.\n\n282\n00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.480\nSo that was my global this\nis equivalent to my private.\n\n283\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.480\nThis is my unique local,\nnow you need to remember this this starts\n\n284\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.508\nwith FC00 and\nthe first 7 bits to find this, right?\n\n285\n00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:27.674\nSo, my private equivalent\nin IPv6 is called a,\n\n286\n00:14:27.674 --> 00:14:32.590\nright here, Unique Local,\nand it starts with FC00.\n\n287\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.520\nSo I need you to remember the equivalent\nof Apipa starts with what?\n\n288\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.570\nWhat's my link-local start with?\n\n289\n00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.670\n>> FE80.\n>> FE80, okay?\n\n290\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.910\nThe global starts with 2000/3, ::/3 and\n\n291\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.420\nthe unique which is kinda equivalent\nto my private address in IP version 4.\n\n292\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.726\nStarts with FC00::/7.\n\n293\n00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:55.810\nNow, let's say you can't remember that and\nyou're in the objectives, maybe taking\n\n294\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.340\nexam or whatever, practice exams and\nit comes as which one is unique global?\n\n295\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.920\nWell just take out the wrong ones.\n\n296\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.770\nIf you know FEA is your link global,\nyou might say something like 127,\n\n297\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.080\nsome IPv4 address.\n\n298\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.610\nAgain, if you know your foundation,\nyou can take off the wrong answers and\n\n299\n00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.210\nyou're gonna be left with what's right.\n\n300\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.430\nThat's what you're looking for.\n\n301\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.990\nNow, let's talk about the host, all right.\n\n302\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.608\nSo there's something I can do called the,\nhere it is EUI-64.\n\n303\n00:15:23.608 --> 00:15:28.920\nThe EUI-64 now this is how when IPv6 first\ncame out this is how they addressed host.\n\n304\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.120\nYou can still do this but it is doubtful\nthat people are going to do this\n\n305\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.620\nbecause what it does is\nit takes the Mac address.\n\n306\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.300\nSo the Mac address if this is the Mac\naddress we can see the fields here.\n\n307\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.657\nEach one of these fields is how many bits?\n\n308\n00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:44.839\nIsn't it 8?\n\n309\n00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:46.151\n>> Yes.\n\n310\n00:15:46.151 --> 00:15:53.107\n>> 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 It's only 48 bits.\n\n311\n00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:57.068\nSo it would be nice if it was 64 bits,\n[LAUGH] at least there's one more field,\n\n312\n00:15:57.068 --> 00:15:58.823\ntwo more fields in there, right?\n\n313\n00:15:58.823 --> 00:16:01.908\nAnyways, then we'd be able to use that.\n\n314\n00:16:01.908 --> 00:16:03.205\nSo we needed it at 64 bits.\n\n315\n00:16:03.205 --> 00:16:08.170\nSo, what they do is we put in\nthe address and we say, EUI-64.\n\n316\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.600\nNow it sends it out, and what it does,\n\n317\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.750\nit tells the host hey,\nhere's your link address you're on.\n\n318\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.975\nAnd this is me,\nI'm your router telling you about this.\n\n319\n00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:23.219\nTake your MAC address and insert 16 bits\nand create your EUI-64 IPv6 address.\n\n320\n00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:28.371\nSo, what we do is we open up the MAC\naddress as we can see here and\n\n321\n00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:29.770\nwe insert FF FE.\n\n322\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.840\nFF FE, we insert that in there and\nnow we have a 64-bit address.\n\n323\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.770\nSo you can tell you have EUI-64\nwhen you see an address and\n\n324\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.080\nyou see FF FE in the middle.\n\n325\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.815\nNow, why won't people use this?\n\n326\n00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:47.050\nBecause you're not very private, you have\na [LAUGH], so when they first did this,\n\n327\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.120\nyour MAC address,\nno matter where you went in the world,\n\n328\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.180\neveryone would know it was you\nbecause you have a unique Mac address.\n\n329\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.370\nYou might get a different link prefix, but\n\n330\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.740\nyour MAC address is always gonna be\nthe same, with the EUI64 in there, right?\n\n331\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.580\nSo people are like no I'm not doing that,\nI'm just going to make mine up and\n\n332\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.620\nthat's typically what it is, but\nthere's one more thing I want to show you.\n\n333\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.780\nIn the beginning in the header, in the\nfirst field, the seventh bit of the first\n\n334\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.420\nbyte, okay this is a mouthful, the seventh\nbit of the first byte actually flips it.\n\n335\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.950\nWhen it's EUI-64 typically\nit's locally unique, right?\n\n336\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.506\nIt's typically a zero,\nyet universally unique.\n\n337\n00:17:23.506 --> 00:17:29.080\nSo, basically I've had--this\nallowed people to make customized\n\n338\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.420\nMAC addresses on their devices by flipping\nthat bit on, and people used that bit.\n\n339\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.090\nBut what happens,\n\n340\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.400\nif you go to IPv6, it actually just\nflips that bit from whatever it is.\n\n341\n00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.360\nIf it's off, it turns it on.\n\n342\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.920\nIf it's on, it turns it off.\n\n343\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.340\nSo if someone had a, and\nthe reason I'm bringing this up,\n\n344\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.050\nI went to a customer in Boulder,\nColorado and they did this.\n\n345\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.040\nI'm like, that's fine, you can do that.\n\n346\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.770\nBut you can't use IPv6, then.\n\n347\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.700\nBecause it's gonna flip that bit back off.\n\n348\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.100\nBecause they were like,\nhow do I make this proprietary?\n\n349\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.590\nAnd this isn't gonna work for\nanyone but us.\n\n350\n00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.050\nIt has to be our software,\nblah, blah blah.\n\n351\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.470\nLike yeah that's fine until you use IPv6,\nthen your network stops working.\n\n352\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.730\nAnyways, because it's going to\nflip that seventh bit here.\n\n353\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.600\nRight here, so if it's a 1 it's a 0 now.\n\n354\n00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.680\nTypically the 0 will flip it on, so\nthis was typically 00, now becomes so\n\n355\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.040\nhere it is right here.\n\n356\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.090\nWe're going to flip it on\nit's going to become 02.\n\n357\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.610\nIt's very possible they might ask you and\n\n358\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.150\nsay It's possible, I don't know\nhow possible but it's possible.\n\n359\n00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.900\nThey say hey here's your MAC address,\nif you get an EUI-64,\n\n360\n00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.405\nwhat's your MAC address gonna be?\n\n361\n00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:30.164\nWell you're gonna have to\nrecalculate that and flip that bit,\n\n362\n00:18:30.164 --> 00:18:33.859\nif it's on you're gonna flip it off,\nif it's off, it's probably typically off,\n\n363\n00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:37.110\nso you'll have to flip it on,\nso you're gonna add a 2 to it.\n\n364\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.940\nRight, because the value of that\nbit is a two one two, right?\n\n365\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.030\nIf you need some practice with that,\n\n366\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.360\nin my book I have a written\nlab that goes through this.\n\n367\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.350\nJust for fun, if you guys are like hey I\nreally want to do this because that's so\n\n368\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.410\nfascinating to me, knock yourself out,\n\n369\n00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.790\nyou'd be the only one that did\nthat written lab, I think.\n\n370\n00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.420\n>> I don't know anyone that's done it.\n\n371\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.570\n>> All right.\n\n372\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.800\nMulticast Mapping over Ethernet.\n\n373\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.090\nSo, when we're doing a multicast address,\nso here's my global,\n\n374\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:07.530\nwe're gonna take the global address and\nturn it into a multicast address.\n\n375\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.130\nAnd the way you're gonna have to\nsee this over ethernet, right,\n\n376\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.270\nwe're gonna look at this, we're gonna\nlook for this header right here.\n\n377\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:17.190\nWe'll come back to this, FF02 is\na solicited node multicast address.\n\n378\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:21.470\nThis is how my routers advertise out their\nnetwork ID, this is how host look for\n\n379\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.120\ndefault gateway or for router, right?\n\n380\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.840\nWith the FF02.\n\n381\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.210\nThis is my\nSolicited-Node Multicast Address.\n\n382\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.460\nThe corresponding ethernet address,\nright, we've got our FFFE in here.\n\n383\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.998\nRight, and then we've got that's\ngonna convert to the FF here and\n\n384\n00:19:36.998 --> 00:19:38.720\nthen use these right here.\n\n385\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.400\nAnd then it's gonna convert over here.\n\n386\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.080\nAnd the way that you're gonna be\nable to tell that it's gonna now,\n\n387\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.980\nit's kinda weird that their asking you\nthis, because you're never gonna be able\n\n388\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.790\nto tell that it did this,\nand you can't change it or\n\n389\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.650\nanything, so it's odd that they're\nasking you to see this, but they are.\n\n390\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.020\nIt's going to convert so just take\nthe last two bytes convert them and\n\n391\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.170\nadd a 33-33 in front, and now you know\nyou've got your multicast prefix for\n\n392\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.450\nethernet multicast.\n\n393\n00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:07.670\nSo, multiple addresses, what this does\nis it takes multiple addresses and\n\n394\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.240\nmaps them into a single\nethernet multicast address.\n\n395\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.730\nOn this answer here, look for\nthe 33 33, that's your best bet.\n\n396\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.830\nNow, let's talk about the difference\nbetween IP version 4 and\n\n397\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.880\nIP version 6 headers.\n\n398\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.280\nFirst off, this is an IP version 4 header.\n\n399\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.800\nNotice I have type of service,\nlength, I see fragment offset.\n\n400\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.250\nIf I was doing As far as\nfragmenting my packet.\n\n401\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.160\nI have identification.\n\n402\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.550\nHere's my Protocol field, right and\nthen I have the Time to Live field, and\n\n403\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.050\nthen my source and destination.\n\n404\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.650\nThe thing about the IPv4 header,\nit wasn't very efficient and\n\n405\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.710\nhad all these fields all of the time.\n\n406\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.320\nAnd so, the header length can vary from\n20, maybe 24, bytes, something like that.\n\n407\n00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.500\nNow, in IP version 6, this doesn't vary.\n\n408\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.030\nIt's only 40 bytes all the time.\n\n409\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.080\nI think I said 40 bits early.\n\n410\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.140\nIt's 40 bytes.\n\n411\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.700\nAnyways, and so basically,\nwe've got a streamlined header.\n\n412\n00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.430\nIt's only twice the size considering\nwe have four times the address length.\n\n413\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.150\nSo, which IPv6?\n\n414\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.190\nSo, here's kind of the things for\nthe objectives, guys.\n\n415\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.330\nI wrote them down here.\n\n416\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.690\nWhat do you think is equivalent\nto the time to live?\n\n417\n00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.430\nIf you look at this,\n\n418\n00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.670\nif you know what the time to live is you\nshould be able to answer this question.\n\n419\n00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.180\nWhat do you think?\n\n420\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.970\nAnybody?\n\n421\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.520\nOkay, so the time to live field,\n\n422\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.290\nit told me how far can a packet go\nbefore it has to kill itself, right?\n\n423\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.460\nSo that limited the packets\nfrom going around for too long.\n\n424\n00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.360\nSo what do you think?\n\n425\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.590\n>> Hop limit?\n>> The hop limit is absolutely right.\n\n426\n00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.410\nThat's equivalent to my time to life.\n\n427\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.810\nNow, the framer one is going to be hard\nto tell, because we had the frame and\n\n428\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.000\nif we fragment it, that's actually\ngonna be my extension header.\n\n429\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.730\nSo, that's my new fragment fills,\nmy extension hitter.\n\n430\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.430\nThose are the kind of\nthings you need to know.\n\n431\n00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.680\nFor the objectives.\n\n432\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.920\nThe time relived field becomes hops, you\nmight have figured that one out actually.\n\n433\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.870\nBut the fragment field would\nhave been a little harder,\n\n434\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.270\nthe extension header information.\n\n435\n00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.690\nIn these three ways an IPv6 header\nis simpler than an IPv4 header.\n\n436\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.290\nSo I'm just gonna summarize this for you.\n\n437\n00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.040\nUnlike IPv4 headers,\nIPv6 headers have a fixed length.\n\n438\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.440\nIPv6 uses the extension header\ninstead of the fragmentation field.\n\n439\n00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.370\nHop count instead of time-to-live.\n\n440\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.620\nEliminate the Checksum field, right?\n\n441\n00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.750\nMake it more efficient.\n\n442\n00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.675\nWe're just going to allow the upper\nlayers to make sure everything is okay.\n\n443\n00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:20.770\nLink-local, now again I mentioned this.\n\n444\n00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.760\nIf I have two routers talking with some\nsort of routing protocol like OSPFv3 or\n\n445\n00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:32.680\nEIGRPv6 is also Rip NG,\nshould be Rip next piece of junk.\n\n446\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.830\nIt's the same protocol,\nthere is no difference.\n\n447\n00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.930\n16 hub, same administrator difference,\neverything's terrible about it.\n\n448\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.298\nIt just accepts IPv6 addresses.\n\n449\n00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:42.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know,\n\n450\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.249\nI was like, man why did they do this?\n\n451\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.700\nAnyways, and then, so\nif I'm talking between routing protocols,\n\n452\n00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.060\nI use the link local address,\nuse the link local address.\n\n453\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.210\nAnyway, that's not the objective,\nyeah so what?\n\n454\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.752\nThis is kudos in care, okay?\n\n455\n00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:01.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, they can do anything they want.\n\n456\n00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.750\nJust remember that ICMP\nis the same protocol,\n\n457\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.690\nwe're almost done guys hang in there.\n\n458\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.450\nICMP is the same protocol\nthat we used IPv4.\n\n459\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.410\nAll right except it's IPv6 and\nit has a lot more power But anyways,\n\n460\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.190\nit still does diagnostics.\n\n461\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.610\nBut one of the things that we use it for,\nwe did it for\n\n462\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.140\ndiagnostics and route rerouting and\nstuff like that.\n\n463\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.350\nThere was things that ICMP was\nvery important IP version 4.\n\n464\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.950\nIt has to be in every stack.\n\n465\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.950\nWe couldn't run our networks without ICMP.\n\n466\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.170\nIn ICMPv6 it takes a lot more.\n\n467\n00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.140\nFirst off, we get rid of ARP\ncuz there's no broadcast so\n\n468\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.390\nwe have to use ICMPv6 for that.\n\n469\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.570\nSo there's a lot more stuff that we do.\n\n470\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.430\nTake a look.\n\n471\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.420\nDiagnostic, of course,\necho, echo, reply CMP.\n\n472\n00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.050\nRouter discovery, router solicitation,\nrouter advertisement.\n\n473\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:51.111\nNeighbor discovery, this is my equivalent\nor my ARP, neighbor solicitation,\n\n474\n00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:52.495\nneighbor advertisement.\n\n475\n00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:55.286\nOkay, now, one of the things,\nin the IP version 4,\n\n476\n00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:58.338\nwe had the protocol field which\nsays who owns this packet.\n\n477\n00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:01.453\nAnd in this case here we have something\ncalled the next header in here.\n\n478\n00:24:01.453 --> 00:24:06.678\nSo this is my IP V6 packet, the next\nheader says who owns this data that\n\n479\n00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:12.660\nI'm carrying and when it says 58,\nwe're saying that it's ICMPv6, okay?\n\n480\n00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.750\nSo the code for, in the next header which\nis equivalent to the protocol failed in IP\n\n481\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.240\nversion 4, is 58.\n\n482\n00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.119\nNow, neighbor discovery, so they set it up\nso this kinda just works, you configure\n\n483\n00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:29.022\nyour router, and then everyone else just\nauto configures themselves, very cool.\n\n484\n00:24:29.022 --> 00:24:32.584\nNeighbor discovery performs\nthe same function that ARP did.\n\n485\n00:24:32.584 --> 00:24:35.126\nNow, you're like, well, I'm so\nglad we got rid of broadcast,\n\n486\n00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:36.806\nwe have a lot less traffic, no you don't.\n\n487\n00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:39.737\n[LAUGH] We just have a heck\nof a lot more multicast.\n\n488\n00:24:39.737 --> 00:24:42.751\nWe still have the same amount of traffic,\nmy friends, but\n\n489\n00:24:42.751 --> 00:24:45.899\nit's all multicast traffic\ninstead of broadcast traffic.\n\n490\n00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:49.665\nReally, you can actually get more\ntraffic with IP version 6, right?\n\n491\n00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:51.462\nDepending on what you're trying to do.\n\n492\n00:24:51.462 --> 00:24:54.070\nAll right, so we have a neighbor\nsolicitation that says hey, where's my\n\n493\n00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.940\ndefault gateway or I'm trying to get to\nthis link or what's your MAC address?\n\n494\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.837\nI want to talk to you.\n\n495\n00:24:57.837 --> 00:24:59.780\nRight, that's gonna be used in IPMPv6.\n\n496\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.041\nLet's take a look.\n\n497\n00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:03.251\nTwo things, okay.\n\n498\n00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:04.970\n[LAUGH] Objective here.\n\n499\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.980\nHow do you get an address, right?\n\n500\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.050\nThere's two ways.\n\n501\n00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.380\nHow do you get an address,\nstateless or stateful?\n\n502\n00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.383\nSo we use network discovery to\ndynamically create IPv6 addresses,\n\n503\n00:25:16.383 --> 00:25:18.632\nso I typically use stateless.\n\n504\n00:25:18.632 --> 00:25:22.680\nWhat that means is the router,\nI just assigned the router, let the router\n\n505\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.406\nadvertisement go out, the hosts pick it up\nand make up an address or we use the Ui64.\n\n506\n00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:29.290\nEither way, that's configured stateless.\n\n507\n00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:34.770\nStateful means I'm gonna give them\nan IPv6 address via DHCP, right?\n\n508\n00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.430\nSo to assign IPv6 addresses and\nmore parameters.\n\n509\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.690\nNow, again,\nyou could use it to assign IPv6 addresses.\n\n510\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.740\nBut usually we're gonna\nuse DHCP to do what?\n\n511\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.980\nGive us parameter,\nespecially like DNS servers.\n\n512\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.160\nDNS becomes, no DNS, I can't even see how\nthis networks gonna work without DNS.\n\n513\n00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.170\nJust not possible.\n\n514\n00:25:55.252 --> 00:26:00.500\nAll right, so\nthe two ways to configure IPv6 on a host.\n\n515\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.330\nStateful and stateless.\n\n516\n00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.890\nStateful and stateless.\n\n517\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:04.810\nStateful, stateless.\n\n518\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.440\nIn your summary, stateful and\nstateless [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.870\nNow, in stateless, I'm gonna go and\nconfigure the router here, right?\n\n520\n00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.480\nSo now I'm telling you right here.\n\n521\n00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.630\nHere's router A.\n\n522\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.547\nAnd notice what I'm doing here.\n\n523\n00:26:15.547 --> 00:26:20.026\nI'm using ICMP, FF02, right,\nthat's my multicast address.\n\n524\n00:26:20.026 --> 00:26:22.610\nFF02 for router discovery.\n\n525\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.909\nIn this case here,\nthis is a router advertisement.\n\n526\n00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:27.765\nA router advertisement,\nlet's check this out.\n\n527\n00:26:27.765 --> 00:26:30.869\nSo, FF02::1.\n\n528\n00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:32.237\nAll right, you need to remember these.\n\n529\n00:26:32.237 --> 00:26:34.963\nIt's ICMP type 134.\n\n530\n00:26:34.963 --> 00:26:37.197\nYou are going to remember this.\n\n531\n00:26:37.197 --> 00:26:39.225\nSo a router, it's really not that hard.\n\n532\n00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:42.764\nFF02::1, right?\n\n533\n00:26:42.764 --> 00:26:43.755\nSo we're gonna send that out.\n\n534\n00:26:43.755 --> 00:26:48.617\nSo everyone, I just advertise out\nmy router, hey, I'm so and so.\n\n535\n00:26:48.617 --> 00:26:50.830\nAnd it goes out as an ICMP type 134.\n\n536\n00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.620\nThis gives me my router\nlink local address, okay?\n\n537\n00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:02.480\nThe FF02 is the all nodes, right here,\nFF02::1 says all nodes on this link.\n\n538\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.410\nThis is the link address.\n\n539\n00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.020\nTake either your MAC address,\n\n540\n00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.790\nif I'm using the UI64 or make it up,\nappend it to this and then send it out.\n\n541\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.840\nOkay, so router link-local address.\n\n542\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.300\nNow the hosts are gonna get that.\n\n543\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.890\nEither use their MAC address or\nthey're going to make it up again.\n\n544\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.430\nNow in stateless here again, so\nin this case here, the host comes up and\n\n545\n00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.530\nsends a router solicitation.\n\n546\n00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.090\nIt's gonna come up and\nsay, I need a router.\n\n547\n00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.840\nNow in IP version 4, this was a point\nof contention for the last 30 years.\n\n548\n00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.550\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nthat IP version 4 sucked.\n\n549\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.110\nHow many default gateways\ncan I have on a host?\n\n550\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.560\nOne, so what did they do?\n\n551\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.550\nThey came up and said, we have one,\nthis router goes down, I'm screwed.\n\n552\n00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.500\nSo we came up with this,\nwhat we're gonna learn next week,\n\n553\n00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.172\nHSRP, or so we can have multiple\nrouters that respond to it.\n\n554\n00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:53.480\nThat was a solution, before that\nwe had something called proxy ARP.\n\n555\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.590\nNone of these are really great solutions\nbecause if we add more routers,\n\n556\n00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:57.790\nwe're spending more money.\n\n557\n00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:02.620\nBut in IP version 6, I don't want\nto assign any IPv6 gateways here.\n\n558\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.678\nThe routers advertise and I keep them all.\n\n559\n00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:10.128\nSo let's say I had four or five routers\nconnected to that link, they're all gonna\n\n560\n00:28:10.128 --> 00:28:13.885\nadvertise, I'm gonna keep them all and\nload balance between them.\n\n561\n00:28:13.885 --> 00:28:15.880\nHow cool is that, right?\n\n562\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.495\nAnd it does this automatically.\n\n563\n00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:21.555\nI don't have to configure some\nload balancing technique,\n\n564\n00:28:21.555 --> 00:28:24.566\nsome fault tolerance technique like HSRP.\n\n565\n00:28:24.566 --> 00:28:30.190\nAll right, so in this case here, it's\ngonna send an FF02 saying hey, router,\n\n566\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:35.909\nI'm looking for router, all routers\nrespond and I'm gonna send this as a 133.\n\n567\n00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:40.062\nSo tell me guys, or Ronnie's gonna\nhave to respond for you guys,\n\n568\n00:28:40.062 --> 00:28:43.092\nif a router is sending this,\nwhat does it send?\n\n569\n00:28:43.092 --> 00:28:46.425\nSo if a router is sending\nall nodes on my link.\n\n570\n00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:48.380\n>> 134\n>> It is a 134 and\n\n571\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.373\nit's FF02::-\n>> 1.\n\n572\n00:28:50.373 --> 00:28:51.121\n>> 1.\n\n573\n00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:55.839\nFrom a host saying I need a default\ngateway or I'm sending something\n\n574\n00:28:55.839 --> 00:29:00.741\nover a default gateway,\nwhatever, FF02::2 ICMP type 133.\n\n575\n00:29:00.741 --> 00:29:02.572\nAll right, that's it for now.\n\n576\n00:29:02.572 --> 00:29:06.720\nIt's all up to you for next episode, stick\naround cuz we're gonna configure IPv6.\n\n577\n00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.830\n>> All right then.\n\n578\n00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.050\nWell, if we take a look at this episode,\n\n579\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.040\nTodd has introduced us\nto the concept of IPv6.\n\n580\n00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:18.481\nRemember this is really replacing\nthe IPv4 in our network as far as\n\n581\n00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:19.894\nthe addressing goes.\n\n582\n00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:23.031\nAnd what Todd has just shown us,\nshowing me at least,\n\n583\n00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:27.311\nis that there's really not a lot of\ndifference in terms of its function.\n\n584\n00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:29.579\nThe way it does things is\na little bit different and\n\n585\n00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:31.950\nthe way that it appears\nseems to be different.\n\n586\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.260\nBut overall though,\nit's still doing the same idea and\n\n587\n00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.780\nthe same business that we need to actually\naccomplish with the IP addressing.\n\n588\n00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.737\nRemember that when we start\ntaking a look at this,\n\n589\n00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:44.830\nit actually is a little bit better in\nterms of the way that we get IP addresses.\n\n590\n00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:49.240\nWe have the ability to do either\nstateless or stateful configurations.\n\n591\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.340\nRemember that stateless is\nthe auto-configuration itself.\n\n592\n00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.020\nAnd then maybe you're doing stateful.\n\n593\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:59.860\nIt means we're gonna require a DHCP server\nto also hand out those addresses as well.\n\n594\n00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.710\nTodd also mentioned some of\nthe different types of addresses in IPv6\n\n595\n00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.150\nthat you need to be familiar with,\n\n596\n00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:09.190\ntoo, including the link local,\nas well as that unique local address.\n\n597\n00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.560\nAnd even that site local, or\nglobal, excuse me, not site local.\n\n598\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.860\nThe globally unique address as well,\n\n599\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.410\nmake sure you also pay\nattention to those addresses.\n\n600\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:24.080\nAnd remember that this is 128 bit address\nfield which Todd has told us is gigantic.\n\n601\n00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.710\nIt's so big that it actually outnumbers\nthe grains of sand on this planet and\n\n602\n00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.980\neven the number of ants as well.\n\n603\n00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.650\nSo there's a lot of information here.\n\n604\n00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.345\nMake sure you go back through it and\n\n605\n00:30:33.345 --> 00:30:35.748\nin our next episode as we\ncontinue through this.\n\n606\n00:30:35.748 --> 00:30:40.118\nTodd's gonna show us some configuration\nexamples to help us to get started and\n\n607\n00:30:40.118 --> 00:30:42.976\nto feel more comfortable\nwith working with IPv6.\n\n608\n00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:45.930\nNow that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n609\n00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.080\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n610\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.448\n>> And I'm Todd Lammle, thank you.\n\n611\n00:30:50.448 -->

He demonstrates how to configure IPv6 routing using RIPng, static routing and default routing.  Using various techniques, Todd demonstrates how to get an IPv6 address on the interfaces statically as well as using the IPv6 autoconfig commands.  Then he creates a static route and a default route between routers.  Todd also reminds us that without using IPv6 unicast-routing, Cisco routers will not use IPv6 for routing and shows us some of the verification commands such as show ipv6 interface brief.",

00:00:20.145\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're taking a look at ICND1 content.\n\n4\n00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.672\nWe're getting ready for that new\nexam that Cisco's just released and\n\n5\n00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:25.843\nwe're in the middle of a part two on IPV6.\n\n6\n00:00:25.843 --> 00:00:28.550\nJoining us today is gonna be Mr.\nTodd Lammle.\n\n7\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.010\nThank you for being in our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.550\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.680\nIt's good to be back and\nlet's finish up this IPV6 section.\n\n10\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.390\nIt's very important, the objectives\nare static and default routing.\n\n11\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.920\nI'm gonna show you a little rip-routing\ntoo, just so you can do this in your lab.\n\n12\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.900\nYou never know when it's gonna show up.\n\n13\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.790\nLet's go ahead, now, IPV6, huge objective.\n\n14\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.250\nNo IPV6, no ccent, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.750\nNo [INAUDIBLE] no ccent,\nIPV6 no subnet, no ccent.\n\n16\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.179\nIt's really your foundation, though.\n\n17\n00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.105\nWhat's an ethernet multicast\naddress start with?\n\n18\n00:00:56.105 --> 00:01:01.810\n33 33, link local, fe80,\nwe have to know our foundation.\n\n19\n00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.650\nHit my book really hard,\ngo through the review and written labs.\n\n20\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.280\nI worked really hard on those to\nhone in on the objectives for you.\n\n21\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.138\nBut let's take a look\nat the configuration.\n\n22\n00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:10.903\nThis is actually the easy part guys,\nlet's take a look.\n\n23\n00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.187\nOkay so to configure IPv6,\n\n24\n00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:18.228\nthe first thing you do is you go\nto global config on your router or\n\n25\n00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:24.120\nswitch and you say IPv6 unicast routing,\nIPv6 unicast routing.\n\n26\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.700\nIf you get an error,\nyou don't support IPv6.\n\n27\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.340\nNow have to change your ios.\n\n28\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.600\nInterface F00 IP address.\n\n29\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.140\nNow we're gonna put an IP address.\n\n30\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.200\nWe can type in, we're not going to\nusually going to type in a link local.\n\n31\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.582\nThat's automatically assigned,\nleave that alone.\n\n32\n00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:44.572\nWe can type in the address as down here,\nIPv6 address, 2001 DB8 3C40.\n\n33\n00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:48.320\nNow you're going to see in my book\nthat I use the prefix DB83C40,\n\n34\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.520\nthat's reserved actually for\ndocumentation.\n\n35\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.800\nSo that's why I always use it in my,\nyou can assign it,\n\n36\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.660\nand I use it definitely in my labs.\n\n37\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.590\nBut that's what it's used for,\nreferences and documentation.\n\n38\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.509\nThis is my subnet.\n\n39\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.745\nNow, notice there's no address,\nquote unquote all host bits are zero,\n\n40\n00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:04.330\nthat's fine.\n\n41\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.060\nIf that's the case, then you're\ngoing to be signing an any cast\n\n42\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.770\naddress to your interface, and a subnet\naddress to your interface, which is fine.\n\n43\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.710\nAny host will then be\nable to connect to it.\n\n44\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.612\nYou won't have an IPv6 address on here,\nbut you're going to have an any cast which\n\n45\n00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:21.626\nthen, you know, you can assign to all your\nother routers and they can all communicate\n\n46\n00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:25.396\nto the content servers and so on, but\nI would still put an IPv6 address on here.\n\n47\n00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:29.204\nNow nonetheless, the EUI-64,\nagain I can put this on here.\n\n48\n00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:31.120\nMy host will start working.\n\n49\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.218\nEUI-64 says hey host,\nhere's your subnet address.\n\n50\n00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:38.086\nEUI-64 says use your MAC address,\ndoesn't it?\n\n51\n00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:41.860\nAnd add 16 bits right in\nthe middle with FFFE.\n\n52\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.500\nNow, to enable rip, now again you're\nlike well it's not in the objectives.\n\n53\n00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.320\nThat's fine.\n\n54\n00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.000\nThat's what people told me last time when\nI wrote my book with IP version 4 and\n\n55\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.440\nI put rip in and it ended up being on\nall the exams even though it was never\n\n56\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.110\nlisted on the objectives.\n\n57\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.510\nOkay, so to enable rip with IP version\n6 we don't do anything globally.\n\n58\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.340\nI have the full configuration here.\n\n59\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.000\nYou just go to each interface\nthat you want with RIPng.\n\n60\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.480\nAll right, it's called RIPng.\n\n61\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.240\nYou say IPv6 RIP a process ID and\n\n62\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.510\nenable, the number is irrelevant,\nokay, and then just enable.\n\n63\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.580\nThat's it, and\nnow it's working on that interface.\n\n64\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.120\nAnd just do that on all the interfaces\nthat you want it to work with.\n\n65\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.290\nDon't put them on the interfaces you don't\nwant it to work with, and you're done.\n\n66\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.296\nOkay, you should practice that in a lab.\n\n67\n00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:30.507\nWhen we get to ICv2 section,\nwe're gonna do the EIGRPv6 and OSPFv3.\n\n68\n00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:35.158\nAll right now, to configure IPv6 static\nroutes, first off, this is core product\n\n69\n00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:38.690\nconnected to the Internet, so\nI'm gonna add a default route.\n\n70\n00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.340\nI don't have it listed in here.\n\n71\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.050\nBut we'll go ahead and\nadd one in here in a second.\n\n72\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.140\nSo the first thing is let's\ntake a look over at my branch.\n\n73\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.180\nI've got 2001:1234:0:1.\n\n74\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.980\nThis is my subnet right here,\nthe 1::1 address on this interface.\n\n75\n00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.580\nSo now I've got an interface.\n\n76\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.350\nThis is actually the subnet that\nit is going to advertise out.\n\n77\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.448\nRight, it's going to use an ICMP,\nroute advertisement, right?\n\n78\n00:04:01.448 --> 00:04:05.888\nI'm gonna send that out and\nthen I'm going to put a default route,\n\n79\n00:04:05.888 --> 00:04:08.436\ncuz this is basically a stub network.\n\n80\n00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:13.871\nThis guy over,\nwe've got a subnet here 2001:DB8:43::91.\n\n81\n00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:20.370\nSo this is my network, this is my subnet,\nthis is my network, this is my subnet.\n\n82\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.160\nNotice it's just dot one, dot two,\nwhatever, colon, colon, one,\n\n83\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.380\ncolon, colon, two.\n\n84\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.020\nNow those guys will come up and\nthey'll start working.\n\n85\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.370\nNow one of the things I'm\ngonna put a static route.\n\n86\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.080\nSince the corp isn't a stub network,\n\n87\n00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.834\nI've gotta put a route that tells the corp\nrouter how to get to this remote network.\n\n88\n00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:37.214\nThis is pretty simple guys,\nso let's take a look at this.\n\n89\n00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:43.100\nSo I say IPv6 route,\nto get to 2001, 1234.:0:1::,\n\n90\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.604\nremember you put in the network number,\nall host bits off, /64, right.\n\n91\n00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:50.300\nAnd how do I get there?\n\n92\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.835\nWell in this case here I went\nover to gig zero zero and\n\n93\n00:04:54.835 --> 00:05:01.970\nI did a show IPv6 int brief or show IPv6\nint gig zero zero and I got this address.\n\n94\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.410\nI copied and pasted it in.\n\n95\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.800\nAll right, because I can't see\nthat by looking at this, right.\n\n96\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.450\nSo, we can see that,\nI mean I can in this case here.\n\n97\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.690\nBut I went over there and\ngot the full address.\n\n98\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.190\nSo, I could type that in or\nI can copy and paste that in.\n\n99\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.255\nNow, there's another thing I can do.\n\n100\n00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:23.486\nI could say,\nan easier way to go is ipv6 route ::/0.\n\n101\n00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:26.041\nNow, this is easier than ip version 4,\n\n102\n00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:30.940\ncuz IP version 4 at 0.0.0.0\n0.0.0.0 next hop or x interface.\n\n103\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.960\nIn this case here, for an IPv6 route,\n::/0 and then the x interface.\n\n104\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.180\nSo on the branch which is a stub, notice\nI just did, I didn't want to put in what?\n\n105\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.830\nAll the routes for the internet so\nI said IPv6 route.\n\n106\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.200\nI said any network, any destination\nuse my x interface gig 0 0.\n\n107\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.600\nNow you can use a LAN interface.\n\n108\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.170\nA lot of people say,\nyou can't use broadcast.\n\n109\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.500\nYes you can.\n\n110\n00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.680\nBut you really want them\nto be point to point.\n\n111\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.150\nIf you put it on a LAN interface, a lot of\ntimes you'll get an error that says, or\n\n112\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.070\nyou'll get a message that says hey,\nthis is gonna cause a lot of traffic.\n\n113\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.960\nAnd it's fine as long\nas it's point to point.\n\n114\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.727\nNow, if this is a LAN\nthat you have hosts and\n\n115\n00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:15.430\nservers on, then you don't wanna use this.\n\n116\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.190\nCuz it's gonna cause a lot of, in this\ncase, if it was IP version four, a lot of\n\n117\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.690\nARP traffic, in this case, a lot of ICMP\nextra traffic trying to find the next hop.\n\n118\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.429\nAll right, but in this case here,\nthey're point to point, so we're fine.\n\n119\n00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:27.448\nSo now I'm just gonna come over here and\nI can do the same thing.\n\n120\n00:06:29.736 --> 00:06:37.530\nIPv6 route ::/0.\n\n121\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.040\nI don't know what this is,\n\n122\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.030\nwe’ll just say F zero zero,\njust pretend we have serial still.\n\n123\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.515\nAnd then x interface,\nthat's zero zero, right and\n\n124\n00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:47.040\nnow I have a route that\npushes me that way.\n\n125\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.200\nThat's as hard as this gets.\n\n126\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.300\nSo notice I could use the next hop,\n\n127\n00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.520\nagain I had to get this address for\nmy coming over to here and\n\n128\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.790\nsaying show IPv6 address and\ngetting the next hop address.\n\n129\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.130\nSo typically when I do default\nroute I'm gonna use a next hop or\n\n130\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.150\nexit interface if I can.\n\n131\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.060\nBut again I have to be directly connected,\nso it's pretty simple, okay.\n\n132\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.560\nShouldn't be any problem there.\n\n133\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.670\nNow, again let's say that\nthe corp is configured here\n\n134\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.090\nI don't really want to do any work\nover here on the branch router.\n\n135\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.470\nSo I'm out at the branch I'm like,\nwell, I came out here,\n\n136\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.800\nI'm in a branch in Los Vegas.\n\n137\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.060\nI really got places to go and\nthings to see, so\n\n138\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.610\nwhat's the least amount of work I can do?\n\n139\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.280\nWell, as long as the corp router is\nconfigured, I can just come over here and\n\n140\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.200\nsay IPv6 address autoconfig,\nand then say default.\n\n141\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.850\nSo it's in brackets, don't put the\nbrackets in, that's saying it's optional.\n\n142\n00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.300\nAnd it's, not only is it gonna\nautoconfigure, it's often gonna insert\n\n143\n00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.890\nin the routing table a default\nroute wherever it got it from.\n\n144\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.330\nSo this would actually start working,\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n145\n00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.246\nI do need the static route over here to\nget to this remote network over here.\n\n146\n00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.799\nBut other than that,\nthis will start working, very cool,\n\n147\n00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:00.396\nwe'll take a look at that in the lab.\n\n148\n00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:04.001\nNow, if I want to put in,\nI got some any CAS addresses here,\n\n149\n00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:07.380\nI can absolutely configure it this way.\n\n150\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.130\nConfig t ipv6 unicast-routing.\n\n151\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.480\nSo, I have to enable it.\n\n152\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.040\nThen I go to each interface and\nadd an address with a different subnet.\n\n153\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.619\nNow, typically I'll do .1 at the ends or\nsomething like that to give it an address.\n\n154\n00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:23.790\nIn this case here, i'm just assigning\nan anycast, or a subnet address to it.\n\n155\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.960\nAnyone that's connected to\nit will get an address,\n\n156\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.053\nthey will take that prefix, add it, and\ntheir link local will talk to the router.\n\n157\n00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:34.970\nHey, I'm also with the EUI64 I am\ntelling it to use the MAC address and\n\n158\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:40.500\ninsert 16 bits FFFE in there, so\nI don't know if we use that a lot today,\n\n159\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.460\nbut it's definitely an option, and\nit is an objective on the exam.\n\n160\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.010\nNow over here on this boulder router here,\nIpv6, now this, so\n\n161\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.250\nthe corp has the three\ninterfaces configured.\n\n162\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.370\nThe boulder will get an address off of\nF00, which is subnet 11 address and\n\n163\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.840\nthen insert a default route that says,\nto get to the corp.\n\n164\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.890\nIt's very simple,\nonce you get your core routers going,\n\n165\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.190\nthe rest of them you can just\nauto-configure, it's very simple.\n\n166\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.100\nAgain, this is the same thing here,\n\n167\n00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.910\nnotice that I'm going to configure all\nthe routers connected to the same link.\n\n168\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:17.980\nSo, this is an advantage of\nIP version six over four.\n\n169\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.770\nWith IP version 6 you can only\nhave wonderful gateway unless\n\n170\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.650\nyou are in something like IPGLPP,\nsomething like that.\n\n171\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.920\nIn this case here, and\n\n172\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.030\neven then you still have 1 listed\nIP address in IP version four.\n\n173\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.790\nWith IP version 6, your host can\nremember multiple IPv6 addresses.\n\n174\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.604\n[INAUDIBLE] So if I had a host here\nit would actually then load bounce to\n\n175\n00:09:38.604 --> 00:09:41.230\neach one of these default gateways.\n\n176\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.200\nVery cool.\n\n177\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.456\nSo the router will give them out or\nsolicit to them FS02::2 and\n\n178\n00:09:46.456 --> 00:09:48.520\nsays hey who's my router.\n\n179\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.553\nWe send out a router advertisement is FF\n\n180\n00:09:53.553 --> 00:10:00.263\n02::1 a host says hey I need you FF02::1,\n\n181\n00:10:00.263 --> 00:10:05.613\nsorry 2 all right saying I need a router.\n\n182\n00:10:05.613 --> 00:10:10.155\nOkay all right guys let's take a look\nat a very simple lab here I only have 3\n\n183\n00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:12.590\nsubnets, 3 links with IP version 6.\n\n184\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:17.680\nI’m going to go ahead and we’ll do\na default route on San Francisco to here.\n\n185\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.490\nI can do that,\nthink about a stub network and remember.\n\n186\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.970\nI can use my exit interfaces\nbecause I'm point-to-point here.\n\n187\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.700\nTypically what we’d refer to this is\na broadcast multi-access network right on\n\n188\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.200\nthis lance but we’re using IPv6 and\nwe never use the term broadcast.\n\n189\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.930\nBut it's a still a link, right?\n\n190\n00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.430\nWe have a ton of ICMPB6,\nICMP traffic going\n\n191\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.960\nto be coming out here if we send it out,\nand we have hosts and servers on here.\n\n192\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.022\nSo if it's point to point you can use\nyour x interface, on static routing,\n\n193\n00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:48.113\ndefault routing, but\nif it's not point to point,\n\n194\n00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:51.001\nyou don't want to use your x interface,\nyou want to use your.\n\n195\n00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:52.600\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a quick look here.\n\n196\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.130\nWe'll go ahead and\ntake a look at LA and San Francisco.\n\n197\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.010\nThis will only take a minute.\n\n198\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.339\nOkay.\nSo here I am.\n\n199\n00:10:58.339 --> 00:11:00.540\nLet's go ahead and start with LA.\n\n200\n00:11:10.344 --> 00:11:11.494\nOkay.\n\n201\n00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:17.688\nConfigt first thing I have to\ndo is IPv6 unicast-routing, and\n\n202\n00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:22.860\nthen interface loop back\n0 IPv6 address 2001.\n\n203\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.351\nNow you guys this is not hard, you're\nlike my god look at all those numbers,\n\n204\n00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:30.501\nno I mean this really isn't\nthat much work [INAUDIBLE].\n\n205\n00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:35.275\nThis is a lot like typing in 102.68.10\nright, and then your subnet number or\n\n206\n00:11:35.275 --> 00:11:37.110\nsomething like that.\n\n207\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.125\nAnd them I'm putting in a host ID of one.\n\n208\n00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:45.620\nRight,so here I am 2001, db8:3c4d,\nthis isn't very much right?\n\n209\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.390\nAnd then my subnet number and\n\n210\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.518\nnow when I go to the next one I can put\nthis, I can just go interface f, 0, 0.\n\n211\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.710\nOutbarrow and there it is, but I know I'm\na subnet 2, so I just make sure you guys\n\n212\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.720\nchange this sub-net number, if were to\ntype in 3, it would give me an error and\n\n213\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.730\nsay, hey, you already have that\nconfigured on the other phase,\n\n214\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.400\nyou can't do that on another one.\n\n215\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.462\nSo note that the only, I kept the same\nprefix which you are always typically\n\n216\n00:12:08.462 --> 00:12:12.524\ngonna do and then just change your\nsub-nets, : : and then I put a host id,\n\n217\n00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:13.899\nnow if I just If I don't.\n\n218\n00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:18.435\nIf I did something like this, and left it\nlike, nope, not that, let me go back, :,\n\n219\n00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:23.034\n:, and press enter, come back and say hey,\nyou're just, warning, not a big deal,\n\n220\n00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.995\nbut you're adding a sub-net\nearning to cast address,\n\n221\n00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.380\nit's not an address on the interface.\n\n222\n00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.990\nYou can absolutely do that and\nthat makes this into a cast address,\n\n223\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.240\nthat's how you would do that.\n\n224\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.900\nOkay, so I'm gonna type my 1 there and\nsay, no, just give me a host ID of 1.\n\n225\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.524\nOkay, so I'm done there now, hold on,\nwhile I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n226\n00:12:40.524 --> 00:12:44.536\nput a route, I could go ahead and\nput a route here to tells me how to get to\n\n227\n00:12:44.536 --> 00:12:47.347\nthe other network, and\nI'm gonna type this in.\n\n228\n00:12:47.347 --> 00:12:51.703\nI'm gonna type this in but I'm gonna hit\nexit but I'm not gonna press enter and\n\n229\n00:12:51.703 --> 00:12:52.836\nI'll show you why.\n\n230\n00:12:52.836 --> 00:12:56.911\nIpv6 route, and\nI'm trying to get to sub net three, so\n\n231\n00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:01.530\nit's this network up here with\na network 3, this is not hard.\n\n232\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:07.296\nStatic routing is not\nhard with db8:3c4d and\n\n233\n00:13:07.296 --> 00:13:10.960\nI'm trying to go to subnet 1.\n\n234\n00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.490\nThank you, Ronny.\n\n235\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.990\nAnd I don't put in a host ID because\nI'm saying go to this subnet.\n\n236\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.156\nNow how do I get there?\n\n237\n00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:21.640\nBy f0/0, now remember, again,\nif you're using a gig or whatever, make\n\n238\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.970\nsure it's direct point to point or I can\njust go over there once I configure IPv6,\n\n239\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.950\nshow IPv6 interface brief, get the IPv6\naddress, paste it in here as the next hop.\n\n240\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.610\nEither way, if I was to press Enter,\nthis would be done.\n\n241\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.840\nNow I'm not gonna press Enter here cuz\nI'm gonna show you something else.\n\n242\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.420\nSo now let's go to San Francisco.\n\n243\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.750\nOkay, so that was where I was\ngonna put the default route.\n\n244\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.100\nSo LA has no routing right now.\n\n245\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.942\nConfigT IPv6 unit cast routing interface\n\n246\n00:13:53.942 --> 00:13:58.809\nloop back 0 IPv6 address 2001\n\n247\n00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:03.674\nDB83C4D of subnet 1, :, :,\n\n248\n00:14:03.674 --> 00:14:10.502\nI'm just gonna be host one, whatever, /64.\n\n249\n00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:12.480\nAdvertise this out.\n\n250\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.859\nAgain, I could just type in the subnet\naddress, but, in this case,\n\n251\n00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:15.936\nI wanna get myself an address.\n\n252\n00:14:15.936 --> 00:14:23.028\nNow, on interface F00,\nI'm gonna say [COUGH] interface F00 and\n\n253\n00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:27.021\nI'm going to give myself an address.\n\n254\n00:14:27.021 --> 00:14:30.625\nSo I'm going to lift this up and\nI'm going to change this to 2,\n\n255\n00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:34.229\nnow this guy was a one so if I type\nthat in and I change this to 2 and\n\n256\n00:14:34.229 --> 00:14:37.150\nI press enter,\nI'd get a duplicate address.\n\n257\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.820\nHard to believe that you can\nget that with IP version 6, but\n\n258\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.070\nyou can because I already put\nthe one on the other side.\n\n259\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.490\nI'd just make this one .2.\n\n260\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.400\nAll right, now that they're up now,\ninstead of putting a static route,\n\n261\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.320\nI'm gonna type this in.\n\n262\n00:14:51.586 --> 00:14:53.687\nIPv6 route.\n\n263\n00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:58.842\nNow instead of 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0\n\n264\n00:15:02.124 --> 00:15:03.459\nI'm gonna say ::.\n\n265\n00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:06.400\nThat's easier than IP versions 4.\n\n266\n00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.190\nOkay, and then use my X interface.\n\n267\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.880\nNow typically it'd probably be better to\ngo get the next hop, so let's go over and\n\n268\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.030\ndo that real quick.\n\n269\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:21.180\nSo since I've already configured this\nother one, now I can come over here and\n\n270\n00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:26.270\nsay, do show IPV6 int brief and\n\n271\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:31.040\nI should have an address,\nI believe I should have one on F00.\n\n272\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.236\nAnd there it is.\n\n273\n00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:35.540\nSo we actually know what it is right,\nbecause we typed it in.\n\n274\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.040\nNow had I not given it an address,\njust colon colon,\n\n275\n00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.580\nit would have made up an address.\n\n276\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.990\nSo we already know what it is 2001DB834C\nI gave it it's address, just : : 1.\n\n277\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:50.398\nRight, so now that we've verified,\nI'm gonna use it as my X interface.\n\n278\n00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:54.403\nOkay, so it's just the same thing up here,\n2001, db8.\n\n279\n00:15:54.403 --> 00:15:57.455\nOkay, so you can copy and\npaste in that prefix whenever you want.\n\n280\n00:15:57.455 --> 00:16:03.478\n3c4d, And then subnet 2::1,\n\n281\n00:16:03.478 --> 00:16:07.370\nso that's my next hop.\n\n282\n00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.450\nSo IPv6 send it to my neighbor.\n\n283\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.520\nSo check this out, I'm gonna say if I\nup arrow and then I'm gonna do this,\n\n284\n00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.772\nI'm gonna leave that address in there cuz\nthat's supposed to be my next hop I'm 1.\n\n285\n00:16:19.772 --> 00:16:23.920\nI'm gonna say do ping, and\nI just pinged my next hop.\n\n286\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.260\nNow hold on,\nI don't have routing on here, so\n\n287\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.156\nI'm gonna say, I'm back on San Francisco,\nIPv6 route, or no, we did do the route,\n\n288\n00:16:32.156 --> 00:16:37.580\ndo sh ipv6 route.\n\n289\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.110\nAnd so there's my default route,\nso over here I\n\n290\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.630\ncould have put that static route in\nthere and if I did that it would work.\n\n291\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.940\nI can go ahead and do that but\nI'm not gonna do that,\n\n292\n00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.530\nI'm gonna do something else over here.\n\n293\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:53.190\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\nsay interface f0/0,\n\n294\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:58.640\nbring up my ipv6 address that I typed in,\nthat's it right there.\n\n295\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.570\nAnd I'm going to put a no,\nI could have done this as a Ctrl+a.\n\n296\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:09.260\nAnd I'm gonna type in ipv6\naddress autoconfig default.\n\n297\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.760\nSo what I'm saying is go to my other\nrouter, give me the configuration, and\n\n298\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.210\ngive me the default route.\n\n299\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.680\nPretty simple, so you need to\nremember this for the objectives.\n\n300\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.600\nNow this takes sometimes a minute,\nnot a long time for\n\n301\n00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.370\nin the sense of how routing goes and\nIPv4 goes, IPv6 is much faster.\n\n302\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.380\nBut we still got to get\na router advertisement or\n\n303\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.878\nthis router's gotta send\nout a router request.\n\n304\n00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:37.530\nYou know, FF02::2 the router\nwould send me FF02::1, so\n\n305\n00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:42.280\nwe gotta wait for a router advertisement,\npick that up, get my address.\n\n306\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.500\nSo let's see what we got.\n\n307\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.416\nLet me just exit exit.\n\n308\n00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:50.310\nShow IPV6 and let's see if I got one.\n\n309\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.550\nAnd I did.\nSo now if I got this address and I said\n\n310\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.410\ngive it to me, now remember, this is why I\ncame over here if I was using my next hop.\n\n311\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.370\nBefore we knew it, cuz I typed in ::1,\n\n312\n00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:04.970\nthat was my address, in this case here,\nI don't ever wanna type this in.\n\n313\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.450\nWe're gonna copy paste this.\n\n314\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.365\nSo now I got my address,\nlet's see if I have some routing, Ronnie.\n\n315\n00:18:09.365 --> 00:18:10.200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n316\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.420\n>> Sh ipv6 route, and there it is.\n\n317\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.160\nAnd I wanted to show you,\nthis is extremely important.\n\n318\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.040\nI've got a static route here that says\nto get out, that's my default route,\n\n319\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.630\nit inserted the default route cuz I\ntold it auto-configure itself and\n\n320\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.340\nalso get me routing, I did very little\nconfig on this router, very cool.\n\n321\n00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.220\nGo make up an address for\nme and give me a default route.\n\n322\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.670\nI had to have that configured\nto another route to get this.\n\n323\n00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.000\nNotice my next hop is what?\n\n324\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.530\nThis is the hugest C sin objective,\nand even on C sin ICD 2.\n\n325\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:50.420\nFor routing protocols to communicate,\nthey don't use your unicast address,\n\n326\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.300\nthey use a link local address.\n\n327\n00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.950\nFE80 is to communicate between routers.\n\n328\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.620\nEven in this case here, for me to get out,\nI'm going to send the traffic to\n\n329\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.050\nthe link local address of my neighbor,\nnot it's unicast address.\n\n330\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.080\nSo it's very important to understand,\nRIPng, EIGRPV6, OSPFV3, and even\n\n331\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.430\ndefault routing, we would set it and say,\nuse the link local address to communicate.\n\n332\n00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.110\nSo we did static routing, very simple.\n\n333\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:22.420\nDefault routing, autoconfig,\nvery simple configuration, guys.\n\n334\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.320\nBig objective, make sure you set this up.\n\n335\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.160\nIf you have packet tracer, this lab right\nhere, set it up it'll work just fine.\n\n336\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:33.430\n>> All right, so in this episode we took\na look at the idea of configuring IPv6 on\n\n337\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.070\nour router and our interfaces here.\n\n338\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.190\nTodd showed us the basic configuration for\nRIPng, remembering that even though it's\n\n339\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.510\nnot called out on the exam itself,\nyou may end up seeing it.\n\n340\n00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.530\nWe've seen it in the past, and you'll\nprobably see it in the future again.\n\n341\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.760\nSo remember that that's never done\nglobally it's only done on the per\n\n342\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.620\ninterface.\n\n343\n00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.400\nAlso, Todd showed us, of course,\nthe ability here to actually be able to do\n\n344\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.760\ndefault routing as well as static\nrouting with IPv6 as well.\n\n345\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.057\nAnd the key command here,\nregardless if you wanna do IPv6 routing,\n\n346\n00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:09.280\nyou've got to make sure you type\nin IPv6 unicast-routing first.\n\n347\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.900\nIf you don't do that, all those other\ncommands will not function for you.\n\n348\n00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.360\nYou will not be able to route with IPv6,\nyou won't be able to do it, so\n\n349\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.370\nmake sure you actually get that in there.\n\n350\n00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.060\nAnd the basis of all these\ncommunications that we're talking about,\n\n351\n00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.230\nthat each interface can actually end\nup with multiple IP addresses, too.\n\n352\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.840\nDon't forget that we'd normally see that\nlink local actually assigned by itself\n\n353\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.810\na lot of times.\n\n354\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.150\nBut then we can also go in there and\n\n355\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.260\nassign addresses the way\nthat we want to as well.\n\n356\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.080\nSo that's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode then.\n\n357\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.243\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronny Wong.\n\n358\n00:20:42.243 --> 00:20:42.940\n>> And Todd Lanly.\n\n359\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.084\n>> And stay tuned right here for\nmore CCENT content.\n\n360\n00:20:47.084 --> 00:20:51.578\n[SOUND]\n\n361\n00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:04.213\n>> All right let me get this ready for\n\n362\n00:21:04.213 --> 00:21:04.918\nthe access list.\n\n363\n00:21:04.918 --> 00:21:05.418\n>> Okay.\n\n",

00:00:19.740\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're taking ICND1 getting ready for\n\n4\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.050\nthat first Cisco exam and who else\nbetter to help us than Mr. Todd Lammie.\n\n5\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.520\nTodd, welcome back to our studios.\n\n6\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.170\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.150\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be talking about ethernet.\n\n8\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.340\nThis is probably a longer section than\nthe last ones we've been doing because\n\n9\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.420\nethernet, ethernet wire, we got binary\nhexadecimal and there's ethernet frame.\n\n10\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990\nSo the objective is in ethernet framing.\n\n11\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.100\nUnderstanding the headers in the frame.\n\n12\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.190\nAs well as the Cisco three layer models,\nso lets go ahead and take a look.\n\n13\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.437\nAll right, to start back and kind of\nreview our last two episodes really, we\n\n14\n00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:58.012\nhave to understand collision and broadcast\ndomains to understand ethernet, right?\n\n15\n00:00:58.012 --> 00:00:59.290\nThis is where we got the term.\n\n16\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.420\nSo, if we look at this here,\nwe have- these look like hubs, so\n\n17\n00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.090\nthat makes one collision domain and\none broadcast domain.\n\n18\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.150\nSo we typically wouldn't have\nnetwork sites like this today,\n\n19\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.690\nas we've already discussed, but\n\n20\n00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.730\nit doesn't matter you still have to\nunderstand the terms collision domains,\n\n21\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.100\nremember if someone is in your collision\ndomain, they are on on your same wire,\n\n22\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.260\nokay your broadcast domain they\nare not to be in the same wire,\n\n23\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.960\nthey can have to be in different\nsegment into a layer two stretch, but\n\n24\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.950\nthat would still make one\nbroadcast domain by default.\n\n25\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.760\nNow, if we'd have switches now,\nevery port is its own collision domain.\n\n26\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.430\nSo let's take a look at this one for\na second.\n\n27\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.630\nSo we have the switch here.\n\n28\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.160\nSo this is a collision domain here,\n\n29\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.230\nhere between these sorts of collision\ndomain in here but look at this one here.\n\n30\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.160\nAnd this is a what and as we discussed in\nthe last in the first internet working\n\n31\n00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.070\nepisode, this is an access point or really\na modem, right from digital to analog.\n\n32\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.030\nSo we're coming out here,\neverything's fine.\n\n33\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.200\nWhat did this do to our network though?\n\n34\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.080\nAnd this is what we need to understand.\n\n35\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.060\nThe access point plugs into our switch.\n\n36\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.360\nAnd it takes that collision domain and\nextends it, doesn't it?\n\n37\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.330\nSo now, we're one big collision domain for\neveryone that's in that wireless network.\n\n38\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.490\nThat's absolutely true.\n\n39\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.170\nNow, one of the things we could\ndo is what we discuss later,\n\n40\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.390\nis take this off and VLAN this off,\nwhich could make it better.\n\n41\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.420\nSo, we'd have one then broadcast domain\nover here and one collision domain.\n\n42\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.840\nRight, so that wireless network is\nextending we get a multiple host,\n\n43\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.290\nthey're on the same technically wire\none collision domain, one broadcast and\n\n44\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.560\nthat if we break that up now\nremember if we don't VLAN\n\n45\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.630\nwe were one broadcast domain be default,\nso all that wireless access point did was\n\n46\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.140\nextend your collision domain,\nextend your broadcast domain, right.\n\n47\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.140\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing,\n\n48\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.380\nit's how we run I just need to\nmake sure you understand that.\n\n49\n00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:55.530\nNow, again, broadcast domains are now\nbroken up by a layer three device.\n\n50\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.640\nSo in this case here we have a router.\n\n51\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.580\nA physical router, but\nthis could easily be another switch,\n\n52\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.240\nan enterprise layer switch, a layer three\nswitch, a lot of times especially if we\n\n53\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.570\nare doing VLAN, that's the best way to\ndo it as we'll see in later episodes.\n\n54\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.180\nSo if we look at this here,\nwe have two broadcast domains, right,\n\n55\n00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.130\nbecause we have two router ports,\none, two.\n\n56\n00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.990\nHow many collision domains\ndo you see here Ronnie?\n\n57\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.630\n>> I'm going to say eight is what I see.\n\n58\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.173\n>> Which kind of one, two, three,\nfour Five, six, seven, eight.\n\n59\n00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:22.927\nIs he right?\n\n60\n00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:26.786\nHe's missing a couple, isn't he,\nbecause the connections from the switch to\n\n61\n00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:29.560\nthe routers are also a collision domain,\naren't they?\n\n62\n00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.560\nSo we have ten collision domains,\ntwo broadcast domains in this.\n\n63\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.490\nAnd this is also, what does Cisco call\nthis when we're connecting lots of\n\n64\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.069\ndifferent hosts into a switch?\n\n65\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.400\nStarts with an m.\n\n66\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.990\n>> Microsegmentation.\n\n67\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.012\nAll right, good.\n\n68\n00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:44.580\nAll right.\n\n69\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.540\nNow, in this case here, if we have\nmultiple devices on the same wire,\n\n70\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.510\nin other words maybe we're using a hub.\n\n71\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.840\nThis is a very good analogy for\nsomething like that.\n\n72\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.040\nCuz it really is just one wire, right?\n\n73\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.170\nIf we do that, we're running\nsomething called half duplex.\n\n74\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.426\nWhat that means is we're\ngonna run a protocol called\n\n75\n00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:08.912\nCarrier Sense Multiple Access\nwith Collision Detect.\n\n76\n00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:13.624\nRight now this was created so that if two\ndevices on the same wire actually transmit\n\n77\n00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:17.582\ndata at the same time, or transmit\na digital signal at the same time,\n\n78\n00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:21.350\nthey will actually understand that,\nstop transmitting.\n\n79\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.040\nBecause before we had CSMA/CD if you\nhad two hosts it just stopped working.\n\n80\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.065\nAll right so anyways CSMA/CD\nruns in half duplex networks so\n\n81\n00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:30.330\nwe'll typically see this\nwhen we have a hub.\n\n82\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.330\nNow, understand your neck your card,\nyour ethernet card,\n\n83\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.040\nis going to turn on this protocol but\nalso the loop back circuitry in it.\n\n84\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.840\nWhy, and why is it only we\ncan run half duplex in this?\n\n85\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.240\nBecause I must listen on my receive pair,\nright.\n\n86\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.469\nI'm transmitting but I have to listen and\n\n87\n00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.855\nmake sure I don't hear any other\ndigital signal except my own.\n\n88\n00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:55.562\nAll right if I hear another digital\nsignal, I send out a signal,\n\n89\n00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.190\nlook here, I send out a jam signal.\n\n90\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.140\nSo here's my collision, so\nwe both send out a jam signal and\n\n91\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:10.950\nstart what's called our\nback off algorithm.\n\n92\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.300\nRhythm, there we go.\n\n93\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.980\nWe started that with his a predetermined\namount of time plus a random time that\n\n94\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.520\nyour host makes up so everyone's timer\ndoesn't expire at the same time.\n\n95\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.260\nSo, as soon as there's a collision,\nwe stop transmitting, we start our jam.\n\n96\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.780\nNow, this seems like it\ntakes a lot of time,\n\n97\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.440\nwe're talking about thousands\nof milliseconds guys.\n\n98\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.900\nAnd then who gets to\nstart transmitting again?\n\n99\n00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.870\nWell, with ethernet, everyone is equal.\n\n100\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.330\nEveryone has equal priority, so\nanyone, you could listen to the wire.\n\n101\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.780\nSo this is a good question for\nthe objectives.\n\n102\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.050\nLet me put it this way.\n\n103\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.230\nWhen can you transmit\non an ethernet segment?\n\n104\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.380\nThe answer is well,\nlet me give you some options.\n\n105\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.200\nWhen there's carrier?\n\n106\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.230\nWhen you get the token?\n\n107\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.280\nWhen there's no carrier?\n\n108\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.770\nOr maybe just three.\n\n109\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.670\nWhat do you think?\n\n110\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.235\n>> [LAUGH] I assume that when\nthere's at least a carrier.\n\n111\n00:05:59.235 --> 00:06:03.130\n>> Yep, that would sound right if we\nwere in telco or something like that.\n\n112\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.970\nIf we were trying to get on our phone,\nwe'd listen for a carrier, but\n\n113\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.370\nin this case here,\nethernet works where if the wire is empty,\n\n114\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.910\nif we have a base band technology,\n\n115\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.810\nmeaning we use the whole bandwidth,\nthat no one can be transmitting.\n\n116\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.955\nSo we listen to make sure that there's\non other signal, no carrier, so\n\n117\n00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:22.802\nthat's how easy it is to\nget confused on the CCM.\n\n118\n00:06:22.802 --> 00:06:25.200\nYou go there's a carrier so\nI can jump on board.\n\n119\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.690\nRight, that makes sense if you were doing\nvoice, but not in this case, right?\n\n120\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.250\nSo we are in ethernet, no carrier.\n\n121\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.780\nAnyone can transmit.\n\n122\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.920\nNow, if that's the case,\nif anyone can transmit,\n\n123\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.280\nwhat's to stop me from saying, I'm gonna\nstart transmitting, so like me Ronnie.\n\n124\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.930\nI'm just sitting here talking.\n\n125\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.670\nWhen can you start talking?\n\n126\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.204\nWell, you can start talking.\n\n127\n00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:49.230\nBut you have to stop\nafter 512 milliseconds.\n\n128\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.310\nRight, that's the ethernet protocol\nthat says you have to take a break,\n\n129\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.900\nmake sure no one else wants to transmit.\n\n130\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.930\nSo everyone knows hey, when they hear you.\n\n131\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.370\nI'm gonna only wait 512 milliseconds,\nthen I'm gonna start talking, right.\n\n132\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.270\nSo, that's kinda how, and then if everyone\nstarts doing it at the same time,\n\n133\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.130\ncollision, jam signal,\ntry it all again, right.\n\n134\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.660\nNow, so if we have a half duplex network,\nwe're going to have collisions.\n\n135\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.690\nWe can only run half duplex, right?\n\n136\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.666\nWe can't run full duplex because we\nhave to listen on our receive pair.\n\n137\n00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:22.840\nOur loop back circuitry is enabled and\nthe CSMA/CD protocol is enabled, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.710\nThis is defined in the original\n802.3 ethernet specification, and\n\n139\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.990\nso remember, we the CSMA/CD protocol Or\nwe wouldn't be able to transmit at all.\n\n140\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.700\nDoes this work great?\n\n141\n00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.495\nNo not at all.\n\n142\n00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:37.470\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's why we're going to use full duplex.\n\n143\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.190\nNow, when we came up with switches we had\na mixed environment of half and full, so\n\n144\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.760\nthis port right here ran half duplex\nover here cuz it was connected to a hub.\n\n145\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.910\nAnd the rest of these can run full duplex.\n\n146\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.804\nWhich means I can transmit and\n\n147\n00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:56.277\nreceive simultaneously which theoretically\ndoubles my throughput, doesn't it?\n\n148\n00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:59.545\nSo if I said I'm running\n100 megabits Theoretically,\n\n149\n00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:04.147\nI say theoretically because we do not get\nthat 200 megabits through a port right\n\n150\n00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:09.230\nwe're definitely gonna get more closer at\nleast to that 100 meg for sure, right.\n\n151\n00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.990\nSo we're not gonna have collisions.\n\n152\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.050\nThe one thing you got to remember for\n\n153\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.870\nthe CCNA is this basically\neliminates collisions over here.\n\n154\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.270\nWe have full duplex point\nto point connections.\n\n155\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.610\nWe're only gonna have collisions any of\nthese devices here can create a collision.\n\n156\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.720\nSo we're gonna get about half\nthe through put or less.\n\n157\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.720\nIt's about 30% through put\non a half duplex network.\n\n158\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.720\nAll right, we get about 70% through\nput on a full duplex network.\n\n159\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.550\nEthernet has a lot of overhead.\n\n160\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.710\nNonetheless, we can absolutely\nmake this work but check this out.\n\n161\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.990\nLet's look at a switchport for a second.\n\n162\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.110\nNow if I do here, and\n\n163\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.840\nI did a show interphase,\nthis is on a switch F zero one.\n\n164\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.710\nSo I'm looking at a switchboard.\n\n165\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.320\nLet's take a look at a couple things.\n\n166\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.800\nThese are some of the things you have\nto remember fro the secant objective.\n\n167\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.290\nNow, there's a couple\nproblems with the Ethernet.\n\n168\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.310\nNick cards, that's so redundant but\nI can't help but saying it.\n\n169\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.040\nNick cards NICs can duplicate\nsomething called a broadcast storm.\n\n170\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.220\nIt can be created by a protocol,\nit can be created by an application,\n\n171\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.870\nit can be created by the lan driver, all\nsorts of reasons that it could be created.\n\n172\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.930\nBut nonetheless,\nthis is called the broadcast storm.\n\n173\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.750\nWe're just sending broadcasts,\nwe're not stopping.\n\n174\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.520\nAnd this actually used to\nbring down our network guys.\n\n175\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.942\nSo what stops a broadcast storm?\n\n176\n00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:22.960\nReally you need a layer three device,\nall right, to do something like that.\n\n177\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.960\nSo what stops a broadcast storm?\n\n178\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.900\nLayer three switch, router, right.\n\n179\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.750\nOkay.\n\n180\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.910\nNow if you have a problem like that,\n\n181\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.710\na broadcast storm, how can you figure\nout which post it is on your land?\n\n182\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.670\nWell you're gonna go and see,\ngo look at your switches and\n\n183\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.490\nsee the port being green amber.\n\n184\n00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.340\nSo gives you a pretty good\nindication physically.\n\n185\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.770\nBut now I can can look at the conficency.\n\n186\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.700\nLook at this.\nSee where it says no buffer, and\n\n187\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.730\nthese numbers are a little small actually.\n\n188\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.610\nAnd then they ignore it.\n\n189\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.080\nSo basically I have so\nmany packets coming in, so\n\n190\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.020\nmany frames in this case,\nthat the switchboard's dropping them.\n\n191\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.600\nSo it's saying I have 987 frames that\nhave come in in the last second or\n\n192\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.610\nwhatever this is, and I'm dropping them.\n\n193\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.385\nSo our nord timer our nord statistics,\nincrements as well.\n\n194\n00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:11.915\nSo if you look at the no buffer and\nthis is your season objectives here,\n\n195\n00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:17.455\nhow it indicates a broadcast storm,\nthe no buffers and the ignored statistics.\n\n196\n00:10:17.455 --> 00:10:18.685\nRight?\nBecause we're ignoring those.\n\n197\n00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.865\nSo we're dropping them and\nignoring those frames.\n\n198\n00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:21.985\nThis is bad.\n\n199\n00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:26.065\nRight and again look at your\nphysical lights first and\n\n200\n00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:28.130\nthen we'll go in and look at the port.\n\n201\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.350\nNow, one of the biggest problems 99% of\n\n202\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.190\nthe problems with ethernet with\nswitching today is a duplex issues.\n\n203\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.125\nSame with the exam,\n\n204\n00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:41.650\n99% percent of the ethernet problems\non the exam are duplex issues.\n\n205\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.640\nSo I have a lot of customers that call,\nhey my internet's going really slow,\n\n206\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.870\nmy network's going really slow.\n\n207\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.980\nRemember, having a duplex issue\ndoesn't mean have duplex on one side,\n\n208\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.430\nfull on the other.\n\n209\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.490\nThat doesn't mean that your\nnetwork stops working.\n\n210\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.080\nWhat that means is your network's gonna\ngo really slow because it's having a hard\n\n211\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.930\ntime deciphering what's going on.\n\n212\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.140\nSo people call up and go,\nmy internet's going really slow.\n\n213\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.090\nWell, they were running, I'd look at their\nrouter interface going to the internet and\n\n214\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.370\nit was set to auto,\nit was set to auto duplex, autospeed.\n\n215\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.580\nAnd what would happen is the other\nside would stop negotiating.\n\n216\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.140\nAnd would probably just go to the lower\none of half duplex and a lower speed.\n\n217\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.060\nAnd in some circumstances,\nthe one I'm talking about now,\n\n218\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.700\nthat was exactly what happened.\n\n219\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.390\nSo the way that I found that\nout was I came up here and\n\n220\n00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.200\nI saw these input errors here were\nlike in the hundreds of millions.\n\n221\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.380\nAnd we also had something\ncalled late collisions.\n\n222\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.870\nThis is the indication right here because\nyou were going to get input errors.\n\n223\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.020\nBut when you have\na combination of that and\n\n224\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.350\nmillions of late collisions,\nthis is going to indicate a duplex issue.\n\n225\n00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.930\nBut really, you don't even have\nto look this far for the exam.\n\n226\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.110\nThere's your answer.\n\n227\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.460\nBut in reality, everything's going slow,\nyou go look at that interface,\n\n228\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.760\ncheck the duplex, this is the first thing\nyou should check guys, is your duplex.\n\n229\n00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.629\nThat's probably your problem.\n\n230\n00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:58.804\nAgain, for your exam,\nbroadcast storm, no buffers ignored,\n\n231\n00:11:58.804 --> 00:12:02.310\nduplex issue, input errors,\nand late collisions.\n\n232\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.110\nIn my book,\nI detailed that out a little bit more.\n\n233\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.880\nAnyway, so let's take a look\nat an ethernet frame here.\n\n234\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:14.200\nSo here's my frame, remember,\nmy packet came down, there she is.\n\n235\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.368\nAnd we did our book ends.\n\n236\n00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:17.750\nRight?\nWe encapsulated the data,\n\n237\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.140\nwe encapsulated the packet\nwith a controller information.\n\n238\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.590\nThere's a couple of things in this header\nI wanna show you that's very important,\n\n239\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.570\nlet's take a look.\n\n240\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.360\nOkay, so preamble,\nstart frame, delimenator,\n\n241\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.560\nthis is basically telling me how\nto sync my data, you know, 101010.\n\n242\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.740\nSo we basically how do we sync and extract\nthe ones and zeroes and build the frame.\n\n243\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.350\nNow, we get our destination and\nour source.\n\n244\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.940\nThese are our Mac addresses, aren't they?\n\n245\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.140\nNow this I just put type in here but\n\n246\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.420\nthis is actually referred to as the ether\ntype field, very important field.\n\n247\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.740\nThe great thing about an ethernet frame,\nthis ethernet II frame that we use,\n\n248\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.640\nbecause what you see is the 802.3, 802.2,\nthere used to be four different frame,\n\n249\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.320\nthe snap, right when we had Apple talk and\nIPS who used different frames.\n\n250\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.880\nThis one is extremely efficient,\nhas the source, and destination, and\n\n251\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.190\none other important field, and\nthat's the ether type field.\n\n252\n00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:12.810\nAnd this says, pay attention here,\nwho owns this packet that I'm carrying.\n\n253\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.680\nI'm carrying a package.\n\n254\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.040\nWho do I give it to when I get to\nthe destination of this guy, right here?\n\n255\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.336\nWho do I give it to?\n\n256\n00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.330\nAnd this ether type field tells me,\n\n257\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.230\nwell in this case we just\ngot it from IP typically.\n\n258\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.640\nOops.\nI keep hitting this on my neck.\n\n259\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.560\nZero x 800, right?\n\n260\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.970\nIs saying IP owns that packet.\n\n261\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.330\nThat's an IP packet.\n\n262\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.000\nSo if we had an ICMP in there,\nzero x zero one, right?\n\n263\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.330\nThat we basically have to define,\nwe're carrying data, who owns it so\n\n264\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.320\nwe know who to give it to when\nwe get to this destination.\n\n265\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.060\nSo that ether type field\nbecomes more important later.\n\n266\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.000\nSo keep an eye on that.\n\n267\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.790\nI'm gonna ask you this later.\n\n268\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.620\nWhat does this do?\n\n269\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.900\nWhat is this ether type field?\n\n270\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.260\nWe're carrying a packet.\n\n271\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.460\nWho do we hand it to when\nwe get to the destination?\n\n272\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.700\nThe frame check sequence filed has\nthe answer to my CRC, doesn't it?\n\n273\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.880\nOkay so now, inside,\nlet me go back one second,\n\n274\n00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.820\ninside this destination source is my\nMAC addresses, my destination MAC.\n\n275\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.520\nRight?\nLet's say that I'm a host\n\n276\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.500\ngoing to the Internet.\n\n277\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.265\nSo I have my source MAC address,\nmy destination MAC is going to be what?\n\n278\n00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:25.150\nIBM.com.\n\n279\n00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.110\nIt's not and were going to find that out\nin the IP routing section, it's going to\n\n280\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:34.400\nbe my default gateways MAC address, on my\nlocal LAN, MAC addresses are always local.\n\n281\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.950\nRight, so this destination MAC address,\nlets take a look at it.\n\n282\n00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.180\nSo first off, we have these bits here, and\n\n283\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.540\nthese actually become important In IPv6,\nand not that important in IP Version 4.\n\n284\n00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.720\nYou probably never played with them.\n\n285\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.470\nBut, we will, when we get to IPv6.\n\n286\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.710\nNow, that being said, this part,\nall here, this first 24 bits,\n\n287\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.820\nlet me change my color here,\nthe first 24 bits are something, called,\n\n288\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.910\nmy OUI, organization unit identifier.\n\n289\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.620\nThis is what the manufacturer\nbuys from the IEEE.\n\n290\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.429\nAnd they spend a lot of money on it, so\nthey would never make duplicate cards.\n\n291\n00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:08.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n292\n00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.710\nBecause it costs them a lot of money.\n\n293\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.680\nSo this is my vendor information,\nisn't it?\n\n294\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.080\nOops, I've got to spell that right.\n\n295\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.260\nAnd then over here is the vendor assigned,\nyou know they have like, I think you get\n\n296\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.400\nlike out of 24 bits it's like 16 million\nand something like, and change, right.\n\n297\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.020\nSo this MAC address,\nwhere do you get it from?\n\n298\n00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.360\nDo you have to go out and\nbuy it when you get your PC or what?\n\n299\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.350\nHow do you get a MAC address?\n\n300\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.730\nIt's actually assigned by the manufacturer\nonto the card so it's burned in.\n\n301\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.500\nThat's why we call it a burned in address.\n\n302\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.100\nRight?\n\n303\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.060\nAnd if we looked at the closer\ninto the OSI model,\n\n304\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.860\nthis assigned MAC address is\nactually slang for data link layer,\n\n305\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.840\nbecause there's a sub layer in\nthere called the MAC address layer.\n\n306\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.060\nAnd that's where this is defined\nwhich is why we call it that.\n\n307\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.846\nBut it's really a burned in address.\n\n308\n00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:53.531\nOkay, in this case here,\nif we can see my example here.\n\n309\n00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:55.783\nI kind of wrote over it, didn't I?\n\n310\n00:15:55.783 --> 00:16:01.623\nBut anyways, so the first three bytes,\nso take a look here,\n\n311\n00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:06.891\nso 1,2,3,\nevery two hex characters is a byte, so\n\n312\n00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:13.780\na hex character is four bits,\ntwo hex characters, makes a byte.\n\n313\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.210\n2x characters makes one byte,\nwhich is eight bits, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.100\nSo here's my vendor information, my OUI,\nand then my serial number of the card.\n\n315\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.340\nThat being said, one more thing I wanna\nshow you right here is this brings me up,\n\n316\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.120\nsince I brought up hexadecimal and\nI brought up Binary.\n\n317\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.340\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at this for one second.\n\n318\n00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.650\nFirst off, what is the decimal and\n\n319\n00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.960\nhexadecimal equivalent\nof this binary number.\n\n320\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.120\nLet me go back to red here because\nthis is important, isn't it?\n\n321\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.653\nOkay?\n\n322\n00:16:45.387 --> 00:16:46.690\nYeah, that's what I want.\n\n323\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.840\nAll right, so if we look at this,\nwhat do you guys think?\n\n324\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.850\nNow I want a binary number if you haven't\ndone this before, I'm sure that you have\n\n325\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.530\nbut lets just go ahead and make sure\nwe got our math down just in case.\n\n326\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.120\nAlright, so remember we start at the right\nmoving left doubling in value for\n\n327\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.690\nour bits.\n\n328\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.510\nSo this place setting is a 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,\n\n329\n00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.050\n32, 64, 128,\nI almost ran out of room there.\n\n330\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.350\nOkay, so that is 8 bits all\nhaving a different value.\n\n331\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:22.080\nSo now you just add up the bits for\nthe values that are turned on with a 1,\n\n332\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.880\nso if we look here, what's turned on?\n\n333\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.740\nWell, we have the 128 bit.\n\n334\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.120\nI break it up here.\n\n335\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.820\nThe 64 bit isn't on, but\nthe 16 bit is, all right, that's on.\n\n336\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:38.120\nI'm sorry, I have the answers here,\nI skipped them already.\n\n337\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.280\nSorry, so the 32's turned on,\nthe 64 is not.\n\n338\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.070\nThe 16, the eight, but\nthe four is not turned on is it?\n\n339\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.310\nSo we have quite a few bits\nturned on in this one.\n\n340\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:54.820\nSo if we add these all up 128 and\n32 is 160 plus 16 is one 76.\n\n341\n00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.570\n>> 176 plus 8, 184, plus 3 is 187, right.\n\n342\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.670\nThat's how we get that decimal, 187.\n\n343\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:06.210\nAll right, now\n\n344\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.970\nwe need to take this decimal number of\n187, I'm sorry, of this right here,\n\n345\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.900\nthis binary number, and we're going to\nturn it into Hexadecimal numbers and\n\n346\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.070\nthe way that we do that is we break it up\ninto nibbles, and a nibble is four bits.\n\n347\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.340\nRight so that's two hex characters.\n\n348\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.100\nAlright, so basically this a 1011.\n\n349\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.170\nSo if I look at this I got my 1011 and\na 1011, and\n\n350\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.220\nthese are done a little bit different.\n\n351\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.120\nThey have a smaller number so\n\n352\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.960\nit makes it a little bit easier,\none, two, four, eight.\n\n353\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.520\nOne, two, four, eight.\n\n354\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.360\nSo, it's not that hard to add it up now,\nis it?\n\n355\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.970\nSo, we've got the eight, the two, and\nthe one, that's 10, that's an 11,\n\n356\n00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.620\nand this is eight, nine, 10, that's an 11.\n\n357\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.730\nSo, we have our hexidecimal\nequivalent of this binary number,\n\n358\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.510\nmy decimal equivalent is 187, and\nmy hexidecimal equivalent Is an 11 11.\n\n359\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:04.440\nWell, as you well aware we can't\nuse 11's or 10's, 11's and so on.\n\n360\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.680\nSo if we look at this our hex\ndecimal numbers are 0 through 9 and\n\n361\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.350\nthen A through F.\n\n362\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.170\nA equals 10, B equals 11,\nC equals, 12, 13, 14, 15 and so on.\n\n363\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:20.410\nWell not so on it's end at half,\nbut my point is that.\n\n364\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.480\nEight, when we get to two digits,\nwe can't do that so we're going\n\n365\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.070\nto use a hexadecimal letter, in this case\nA, so this one actually becomes what?\n\n366\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.090\nBB.\nSo the answer to this is BB.\n\n367\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.850\nSo if we got something like this, it would\nbe 187, we take from there, and then BB.\n\n368\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.979\nLet's take a look at another example.\n\n369\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.530\nSo here's another binary example.\n\n370\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.550\nWe wanna make sure you have this down,\nokay.\n\n371\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.810\nYour answer on this one,\nso take a look here, so\n\n372\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.360\nI've got, what is this in decimal?.\n\n373\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.490\nSo let me do this.\n\n374\n00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.470\nAnd I'll show you the answer here.\n\n375\n00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.290\nOkay, so what bits do we have on?\n\n376\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.450\nWell, we have the 128.\n\n377\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.110\nAnd 64.\nWe got a 32 16, but\n\n378\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.870\nwe do have the 8 and the 4.\n\n379\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.680\nI'm pretty sure you guys\nprobably all see that.\n\n380\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.640\n128 and 64 is-\n>> 192.\n\n381\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.510\n>> 192, you can tell this guy can subnet.\n\n382\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.410\nPlus 8, would be what, 200?\n\n383\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.800\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then so that equals 204.\n\n384\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.370\nThat's not so bad, is it?\n\n385\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.280\nNow without looking at the answer here\nwhat will be my hexadecimal answer?\n\n386\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.870\nLet me change my color\ncome down here I get\n\n387\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.030\na purple here see how that\nwork maybe it's pink, right?\n\n388\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.270\nSo now what is my hexadecimal guys?\n\n389\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.940\nSo it looks like we got an eight and\na four here, right?\n\n390\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.060\nOops [INAUDIBLE] with that guy,\nlet me try that again The eight and\n\n391\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.150\na four, so that's eight and\na four which is what?\n\n392\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.850\n>> 12.\n>> 12.\n\n393\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.510\nSo we have a 12 here.\n\n394\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.600\nAnd it looks like we have a 12 here.\n\n395\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.450\nSo we have 204,\nthen a 12 12, which is what?\n\n396\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.510\nA is ten, b is 11, so it'd be 204 cc.\n\n397\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.110\nNow we'll typically see\nthis written as 0XCC,\n\n398\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:55.060\n0X is telling us it's in hex\nalright lets come down here\n\n399\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.540\nnow you guys don't have the answer on\nthe screen what are you going to do.\n\n400\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.660\nAlright, here we go, alright Ronnie,\n\n401\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.125\nshow them you are the boss here, give me\nthe decimal, the hexidecimal Equivalent.\n\n402\n00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:11.215\n>> You have 128 plus 32 which would\nbe 160 plus 16 which is 176 and\n\n403\n00:21:11.215 --> 00:21:14.785\nthen you have a 4 which would\n\n404\n00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:21.508\nbe 180 and then a 1, 181.\n\n405\n00:21:21.508 --> 00:21:23.340\n>> 132, 160, 176,\n>> 181.\n\n406\n00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.215\nYep, had to double check his math there,\nguys.\n\n407\n00:21:26.215 --> 00:21:26.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n408\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.850\nnow in hexadecimal,\nwe're gonna break it up right here, right.\n\n409\n00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.970\nSo 1011, uh-oh,\nthis one's different, 0101.\n\n410\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.080\nWhat do you think?\n\n411\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.090\nSo we got an 821.\n\n412\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.990\n>> That's an 11.\n\n413\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.350\n>> That's an 11, so he's got an 11.\n\n414\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.450\nWhich is a B.\n\n415\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.460\n>> B.\n>> And then this\n\n416\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.290\nis a-\n>> Five.\n\n417\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.930\n>> F5.\nSo it'd be, now this is why we\n\n418\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.694\nuse the zero ax because when it came out\nB5, what is it if it came out like 55?\n\n419\n00:21:53.694 --> 00:21:55.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then you wouldn't know it that\n\n420\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.240\nwas decimal or\nhex which is why they use the zero X.\n\n421\n00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.790\nAll right guys, if you don't have that\ndown, run over to my book in this chapter.\n\n422\n00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.710\n>> Chapter 2 and [COUGH] practice, I have\na written lab at the end of the chapter.\n\n423\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.910\n>> Alright, well Todd that looks like\na great place for us to actually\n\n424\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.460\ntake a look at the information that we\nhave been given so far on ethernet.\n\n425\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.640\nRemember that what we have covered\nhere on this episode, right,\n\n426\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.790\nis to take a look at the very\nbeginnings About collision and\n\n427\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.860\nbroadcast domains as well as talked\nabout the basics of the ethernet\n\n428\n00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.710\nframe itself and what has to happen there,\nand the breakdown to that frame and\n\n429\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.100\nthose individual components,\nalong with the Mac address itself.\n\n430\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.500\nAnd I think Todd is actually\nemphasizing that if we're not good at\n\n431\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.250\nbeing able to convert binary\nto decimal numbers and\n\n432\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.730\nalso converting binary to hexadecimal\nnumbers, Then this is a great time for\n\n433\n00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.340\nus to slow down and go,\nmaybe I need to get really good at that,\n\n434\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.440\nat least I'm assuming that's what Todd\nis helping us to focus in on here.\n\n435\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.980\nBut those are actually great concepts, and\n\n436\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.450\nwe all do need to make sure\nthat we are good at that\n\n437\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.960\nwhen it comes down to the exam because\nyou're not going to have a lot of time.\n\n438\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.580\nAlso, of course, it's actually\na great skill to have because\n\n439\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.340\nwe're getting more in depth and this stuff\nis going to help us a little bit later on.\n\n440\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.760\nSo it's a great reminder, and\nthank you again Todd, like I said.\n\n441\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.270\nThank you also for joining us today, too.\n\n442\n00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.190\nSigning off for IT Pro

He shows clearly the differences between straight through, crossover and rolled cables and their uses in context of connecting to networking equipment.  Todd points out that cisco provides a 3 layer model of Core, Distribution and Access layer devices  when designing networks.",

us\nout here is gonna be Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.960\nTodd welcome back.\n\n7\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.230\n>> Thank you Ronnie, let's jump\nright back in where we left off.\n\n8\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.290\nAnd we're gonna start talking about\ntwisted pair of cable in a different\n\n9\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.927\ncategories.\n\n10\n00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:33.880\nNow I know you're gonna go,\nwell that's not in the objectives.\n\n11\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.990\nPeople write me all the time and go,\nwell you have this in your book and\n\n12\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.330\nyou have that,\nI don't know why you put that in there.\n\n13\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.840\nAnd then they go and take their test and\nthey come back and go,\n\n14\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.170\nI wish I would've read your book and\nlistened to you.\n\n15\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.040\nAll right, so do me a favor and let's\npay attention here for a minute, okay?\n\n16\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.540\nNow this isn't right out of my book,\ncopy and paste in here, but\n\n17\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.070\nI wanna go through it with you\nbecause it's important, okay?\n\n18\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.130\nSo it's a little bit hard to see,\nI understand that.\n\n19\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.010\nThis is un to Unshielded Twisted Pair,\nrefered to as UTP, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.040\nThat's what we typically\nuse in today's network.\n\n21\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.678\nLet's take a look at these.\n\n22\n00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:06.400\n10Base-T is 802.3,\nit's been around since dirt, right?\n\n23\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.145\nThe original category, this is what\nwe usually use for 10 meg, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:13.300\n10 megabit per second,\nhalf duplex although we could use it for\n\n25\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.220\nfull duplex, but it's certainly not for\nuse in today's network.\n\n26\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.260\nI wonder if you can still buy it.\n\n27\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.958\nI haven't even looked.\n\n28\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.097\nAnyways, we're typically gonna\nuse something more called\n\n29\n00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:25.838\n100Base-TX technology, 802.3u, right?\n\n30\n00:01:25.838 --> 00:01:28.638\nThose are the things they're gonna\nask you, this is my fast Ethernet.\n\n31\n00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:31.238\nThis is how I got to my\n100 megabits per second.\n\n32\n00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:33.890\nOkay, so this could be used on category 5,\n5E or 6.\n\n33\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.070\nNow the different categories\nmeans just more twists\n\n34\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.250\nper square inch which gives us.\n\n35\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.490\nThat are less cross talks or\nwe can go further, basically and faster.\n\n36\n00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.200\nBut two pairs,\nwe still only use two pairs, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.350\nAnd that's important to understand here.\n\n38\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.350\nAnd this went up to 100 meters,\nthe same thing here.\n\n39\n00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.300\nThis goes up to 100 meters\nas well in the 10Base-T.\n\n40\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.240\n100 meters is how far?\n\n41\n00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.218\n>> 328 feet.\n\n42\n00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.970\n>> 328 feet, yes.\n\n43\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.580\nAnd so that's important cuz you might look\nat a figure on the exam and it'll say like\n\n44\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.520\n500 feet or something like that and you're\ngonna go what's wrong with this picture,\n\n45\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.430\nwhy isn't it working or\nsomething like that?\n\n46\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.980\nCan't we use an RJ45 connector?\n\n47\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.110\nRemember this, physical star,\nlogical bus, our hybrid technology there.\n\n48\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.910\nWe had the 100Base-FX we don't\nreally use this to much do we?\n\n49\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.100\nBecause we gonna come down here and\nuse this.\n\n50\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.240\nNow this is gonna, we are gonna use\nall eight pins on this one here and\n\n51\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.165\nthis is 1000Base-CX also\nIEEE standard is 802.3z.\n\n52\n00:02:36.165 --> 00:02:41.100\nNow this is, whoops,\nthis is used in data centers, right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.345\nThis is what I use in my data centers.\n\n54\n00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:46.260\nCuz people are like,\nwe don't use coax, yes, we do.\n\n55\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.540\nI see people telling me,\nwell, no one uses coax.\n\n56\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.160\nI'm like, right here.\n\n57\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.170\nIn my data centers,\nI can get really high speeds 10 gig or\n\n58\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.180\nmore at short distances with\ncoax in the data centers.\n\n59\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.700\nIt's a great way to go without\nhaving to do fiber everywhere.\n\n60\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.538\nIt had a 1000Base-CX.\n\n61\n00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.998\nUTP, this is my 1000Base-T.\n\n62\n00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:11.310\nSo category 5, we would probably use\nfive plus or something like that.\n\n63\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.370\nBut this is referred to as 802.3ab,\n802.3ab.\n\n64\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.360\nOkay now,\nwe're gonna get into our fiber, right?\n\n65\n00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.240\nSX, think short distance, 802.3z.\n\n66\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.540\nLX, long distance, right?\n\n67\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.170\nNow this ZX is a Cisco proprietary,\none Cisco standard right there.\n\n68\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.820\nAll of these give us Gigabit\nspeeds over so this is multimode.\n\n69\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.130\nAnd this is going to be single mode,\nthe LX long, right?\n\n70\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.320\nShort mode, long mode,\nthink short and long.\n\n71\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.310\nAnd then we have this Cisco right here\nwhich goes up to almost 45 miles.\n\n72\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.790\nThat's a long way, right?\n\n73\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.790\nSo we can communicate at gigabit speeds.\n\n74\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.680\nI need some of that ZX at my house.\n\n75\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What do you think?\n\n76\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.110\nAll right,\nif you want to know more about it,\n\n77\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.100\nI wrote it at nauseum into my book there.\n\n78\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.758\nSo go ahead, if you can't sleep,\nyou know where to run to.\n\n79\n00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:08.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, straight-through cable.\n\n80\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.980\nAll right, now if we look at this, this\nis if we were running 100BaseT, right?\n\n81\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.960\nWe're only using the two wire pair.\n\n82\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.370\nHere's my transmit, and\nthese are my receive pairs.\n\n83\n00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.440\nOne and two transmit, three and\nfour, now this is on my PC.\n\n84\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.110\nBut if you look at my switch and\nmost people don't pay attention to that,\n\n85\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.750\nmy received pairs now is one and\ntwo isn't it?\n\n86\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.748\nAnd my transmit pairs are two and six.\n\n87\n00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:36.104\nAll right, so on the switches\nare going to be backwards or\n\n88\n00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:38.128\nwe're not gonna be able to communicate,\nokay?\n\n89\n00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:42.790\nSo we're gonna use a straight\nthrough cable to connect a host into\n\n90\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.260\na switch straight through cable.\n\n91\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.090\nNow on the CCENT objectives\nyou do have to understand\n\n92\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.750\nwe really don't have\nauto detect mechanisms.\n\n93\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.640\nThey want you to understand straight\nthrough cable host, or router, or\n\n94\n00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.320\nprinter into switch.\n\n95\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.670\nSwitch to switch would be a what?\n\n96\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.200\n>> Would be a crossover.\n\n97\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.140\n>> Crossover, now we know in\nproduction that's not true today.\n\n98\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.300\nI could take two switches man,\nfrom anywhere.\n\n99\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.858\nI could go get them from Best Buy and\nthey're probably gonna work, right?\n\n100\n00:05:05.858 --> 00:05:07.830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Two $50 switches today, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.690\nSo if we look at that, we're gonna need\na crossover cable between two switches.\n\n102\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.570\nSo in this case here, check this out.\n\n103\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.230\nWe go one, two, three.\n\n104\n00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.940\nOkay, so it's one to three and two to six,\nthat's my crossover, isn't it?\n\n105\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.610\nOne to three and two to six.\n\n106\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.120\nNot good enough for today,\nthough this is only a 100 megabits and\n\n107\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.400\nwe're not just running a 100 megs.\n\n108\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.360\nYou shouldn't just be\nrunning a 100 megabits.\n\n109\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.040\nSo if you only use two pairs and\nyou didn't put the other ones in,\n\n110\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.540\nwe use to make cables like that\ncause I was lazy, I was in a hurry.\n\n111\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.930\nIt works fine until you get to gigabit and\n\n112\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.180\nthen all of a sudden it kinda goes up and\ndown, up and down.\n\n113\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.150\nSo you'll see that problem if\nyou don't use all eight cables.\n\n114\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.582\nNow if I have a straight-through cable,\n\n115\n00:05:45.582 --> 00:05:49.350\nnotice this they have it as 10/100 here,\n10/100.\n\n116\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.258\nOnly using two pair, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:53.715\nSwitch-to-switch so crossover.\n\n118\n00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:56.645\nSwitch to switch, switch to hub, right?\n\n119\n00:05:56.645 --> 00:06:03.620\nHub to hub, direct router interface to\nrouter interface, router to PC, PC to PC.\n\n120\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.430\nFor the most part most of these work\nwe don't even have these though,\n\n121\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.200\nmost of these will work with just\nput in any type of cable, today.\n\n122\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.280\nHowever, there are some instances that\nI do have to plug into a router and\n\n123\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.680\ndepending on the router,\nI do have to use a crossover.\n\n124\n00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.990\nIt does happen.\n\n125\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.850\nThe reason that Cisco wants you to\nknow this and not use the auto detect\n\n126\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.840\nmechanisms cuz you won't be able to\nfix it if the problem occurs, right?\n\n127\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.660\nAnd so it is a very simple problem\nthat people do not pay attention to.\n\n128\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.870\nNow on the Straight-Through cables,\ntake a look over here.\n\n129\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.050\nWe have switch to router,\nrouter into switch, PC into switch,\n\n130\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.500\nserver into switch, hub into PC and\nhub to server and so on.\n\n131\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.340\nAnd I think you guys are getting\nthe rhythm here so we do have to\n\n132\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.930\nunderstand when we use a crossover and\nwhen we use a straight through.\n\n133\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.810\nLet's take a look at gigabit now.\n\n134\n00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.660\nOkay, we have our 1000Base-T.\n\n135\n00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.890\nSo when I get you my 1000Base-T,\nit requires four wire pairs and\n\n136\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.940\nuses more advanced\nelectronics symbols aside.\n\n137\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.330\nSo obviously we can do higher bit rates.\n\n138\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.110\nNow in this case here,\nif we are doing a crossover,\n\n139\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.510\nwe still go one to three and\ntwo to six, right?\n\n140\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.810\nThat's our typical crossover over here.\n\n141\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.850\nBut we also, then, are going to have what?\n\n142\n00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.110\nFour to seven and five to eight, right?\n\n143\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.160\nThis has to be done to get our\nspeeds that we need today, right?\n\n144\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.650\nAnd we can do this with\nenhanced category five.\n\n145\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.440\nCategory five enhanced, right?\n\n146\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.040\nCategory six is great, but good luck\npulling that to each desktop, right?\n\n147\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.890\nThat's a pretty tough wire to pull, right?\n\n148\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.850\nNow there's something else that\nwe use specifically speaking to\n\n149\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.610\nnetwork devices like Cisco switches, Cisco\nrouters, or pretty much any manufacturer.\n\n150\n00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.490\nWe use something called\na console table cable.\n\n151\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.950\nWe have an RS-232 port off of here.\n\n152\n00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:52.140\nNow typically use a USB connection or\na mini-USB, right, over here.\n\n153\n00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.653\nSo we can go USB to USB or\nsomething like that.\n\n154\n00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:58.871\nSo it's hard to find a COM\nport On laptops today.\n\n155\n00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:03.711\nI used to just carry an extra laptop\naround to get them until now we have\n\n156\n00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:04.470\nour USBs.\n\n157\n00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.110\nBut these are called rolled cables, guys.\n\n158\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.320\nRolled, right?\n\n159\n00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.360\nSo one to eight, two to seven, and so on.\n\n160\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.430\nPretty simple.\n\n161\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.070\nDon't get them confused with your\ncrossovers or anything like that.\n\n162\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.040\nThey're not interchangeable\nthe straight and\n\n163\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.330\ncross over are interchangeable in today's\ncuz if we go back, let me go back.\n\n164\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.140\nIf I come here and\nI put a straight through gigabit in,\n\n165\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.990\nthe reason that it works is they run\nan Ethernet standard called the Mdix.\n\n166\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.770\nAnd what that is is an autodetect\nmechanism to determine\n\n167\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.560\nwhat type of cable that you're running.\n\n168\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.470\nAnd pretty much every\ndevice runs that today.\n\n169\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.600\nThat's why we don't see\nthis problem too often.\n\n170\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.010\nNow, when I connect the device,\n\n171\n00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.570\nfirst I'm gonna have to have\nI usually use secure CRTs.\n\n172\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.470\nThis is a screen shot from my laptop.\n\n173\n00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:50.690\nSecure CRT here, I use serial, COM1, so\nthis is what we need to pay attention to.\n\n174\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.760\n9600, 8, no parity, one stop bit.\n\n175\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.380\nI don't know if you can read that\nnow that I wrote all over it.\n\n176\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.740\nAnd here's the deal.\n\n177\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.860\nYou guys gotta remember,\nno or none for flow control.\n\n178\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.890\nOkay, so 9600, I should write that\nout because I just wrote all over it.\n\n179\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.000\nEight none one right, and\nthen no flow control.\n\n180\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.850\nNow over here,\nlet's take a look at my 29 60 that I used.\n\n181\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.700\nAnd you notice that these are my\nconsoles notice I have an RJ 45 here But\n\n182\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.082\nthis is a mini-USB, isn't it?\n\n183\n00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:23.070\nA mini-USB, that'll work.\n\n184\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.660\nNow, funny thing is,\nwhat happens if you plug them both in?\n\n185\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.590\nThe mini-USB takes over and\nyou can't use the RJ-45, right.\n\n186\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.330\nSo kinda cool.\n\n187\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.080\nNow, let's just test Ronnie to see\nif he was paying attention, guys.\n\n188\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.840\nWhat do you think?\n\n189\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.740\nAll right,\nyou think he's gonna pass this time?\n\n190\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.850\nI think he was what, he's about 50-50.\n\n191\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.860\n>> You know easily.\n\n192\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.480\n>> Yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.200\nAll right, what type of cable between\nthese two switchers would you use if\n\n194\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.750\nyou're not in real life,\nif you're on the CCNA.\n\n195\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.170\n>> You would need a crossover cable.\n\n196\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.670\n>> That is right, ding, ding, ding,\nRonnie gets one right, all right.\n\n197\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.150\nSo, in order for host A to ping those B,\nyou need a crossover cable, and\n\n198\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.130\nyou're like this is the CCNA, well, maybe,\nmaybe not, but if this question comes up,\n\n199\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.390\ndo you really wanna miss it?\n\n200\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.410\nIt's a lot of money per question now.\n\n201\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.210\nAll right, so\n\n202\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.420\nlet's see if Ronnie can list the different\ncables that we're using in here now.\n\n203\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.990\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n204\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.410\nIs he gonna go two for two?\n\n205\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.010\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n206\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.987\nWe're watching you.\n\n207\n00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:15.648\nGo ahead.\n\n208\n00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.164\n>> All right, so\nfrom the PC to the switch,\n\n209\n00:10:17.164 --> 00:10:18.689\nthat would be a straight through cable.\n\n210\n00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:19.833\n>> Yeah, straight through.\n\n211\n00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.971\n>> And then from both,\nyep, on both of them.\n\n212\n00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:27.914\nAnd then from the switches to the central\nswitch there, should be crossover cable.\n\n213\n00:10:27.914 --> 00:10:30.143\n>> Crossover, crossover is correct.\n\n214\n00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:31.306\nHe got it, ding ding ding.\n\n215\n00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:32.105\nThat's the hardest part.\n\n216\n00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:34.624\nNow, from the switch to the router,\nthis might be a little challenging.\n\n217\n00:10:34.624 --> 00:10:36.436\n>> That's gonna be\na straight through cable.\n\n218\n00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.390\n>> That is gonna be\na straight through cable.\n\n219\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.860\nAnd what do you think this\nconsole this RS-232 over here.\n\n220\n00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.570\n>> That should be that rolled-\n>> It is a rolled case.\n\n221\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.280\n>> Yeah, a rolled cage.\n\n222\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.450\n>> And guys, for this section,\nRonnie goes to the two so far, but wait.\n\n223\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.250\nWe got some challenges for him here.\n\n224\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.990\n>> No.\n>> All right,\n\n225\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.880\nlet's take a look at this, okay.\n\n226\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.910\nFirst off, we have to not only figure out\nthe cables, but the types of devices.\n\n227\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.370\nAll right, so\nwe've got three different devices, right?\n\n228\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.660\nAnd F going to an ISP.\n\n229\n00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.450\nNow remember I want you he is gonna have\nto think about whence that we talked about\n\n230\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.000\nearlier.\n\n231\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.560\nRemember in our networking episode.\n\n232\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.600\nAll right, Ronnie so go ahead.\n\n233\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.660\nWhat are the three devices?\n\n234\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.830\n>> The A should be a router?\n\n235\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.510\n>> That is gonna be a router\nconnecting to our ISP.\n\n236\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.030\nThat's right.\n\n237\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:31.000\n>> All right and then the\n>> B device, that could be a switch.\n\n238\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.220\n>> Switch, I like that answer.\n\n239\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.870\nSo far so good, what do you think?\n\n240\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.700\n>> Then C,\nit's either gonna be a switch or a hub.\n\n241\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.832\nI'm not sure which one [CROSSTALK]\n>> It's 2016,\n\n242\n00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:44.276\nI think we'll use a switch there.\n\n243\n00:11:44.276 --> 00:11:45.079\n>> Yep.\n\n244\n00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.713\n>> We could wait for\na while to see if we can find a hub but\n\n245\n00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:49.960\nnonetheless\n>> So so far, what do you guys think?\n\n246\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.985\nHe's doing pretty good.\nAll right,\n\n247\n00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:53.414\nnow he's just gotta figure\nout all the cabling.\n\n248\n00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:56.958\nWhat do you think over here,\nRonnie, on this routed ISP?\n\n249\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:03.762\n>> I would use one of the gigabit\nfiber ones, I don't know which one.\n\n250\n00:12:03.762 --> 00:12:05.178\n>> Wow that would be kind of nice.\n\n251\n00:12:05.178 --> 00:12:06.374\nI don't have that one in my house.\n\n252\n00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:08.161\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But he gets to use that.\n\n253\n00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:09.203\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me tell\n\n254\n00:12:09.203 --> 00:12:11.006\nyou what I get to use I live\nin the mountains of Colorado.\n\n255\n00:12:11.006 --> 00:12:12.644\nI used a serial cable.\n\n256\n00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:14.117\n>> A serial cable nice.\n\n257\n00:12:14.117 --> 00:12:15.177\n>> Here and\nthat's what the objectives are gonna be.\n\n258\n00:12:15.177 --> 00:12:17.460\n>> Sorry about that [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah that's gonna be considered.\n\n259\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.261\n>> Don't follow Ron.\n\n260\n00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:21.534\n>> The serial WAN connection here for\nnow, all right\n\n261\n00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:23.186\n>> Now if they were to ask and\n\n262\n00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:27.230\ntell you that was MPLS then\nyou have a different answer.\n\n263\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.840\nIn this case here now he is going to\nfigure out the cables that go between\n\n264\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.910\nA and B.\n\n265\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.860\nThis is a router to a switch and\nthen a switch to a switch.\n\n266\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.470\n>> I would say that from the switch to\nthe router that would be one of those.\n\n267\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.093\n>> Gigabit twisted pairs cables\nbecause they are 30 meters distnace.\n\n268\n00:12:45.093 --> 00:12:45.720\n>> What do you think?\n\n269\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.196\nCrossover, console?\n\n270\n00:12:47.196 --> 00:12:47.963\n>> Straight through.\n\n271\n00:12:47.963 --> 00:12:51.296\n>> The rest of your answer was\ncorrect is just finishing of\n\n272\n00:12:51.296 --> 00:12:55.424\nthere a straight through,\nI run 10 gigs he's only running gig but\n\n273\n00:12:55.424 --> 00:13:00.077\nMike would be a 10 gig cable whatever\nthat mean they look exactly the same.\n\n274\n00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:03.405\nAnyways, now we've got\nthe connection between C and B,\n\n275\n00:13:03.405 --> 00:13:07.230\nwhy don't we just throw a little\ncap 5 in there and make it cheap?\n\n276\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.413\nWhat do you think?\n\n277\n00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.073\n>> I don't think so.\n\n278\n00:13:10.073 --> 00:13:12.390\nIt's got 210 meters.\n\n279\n00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.180\n>> Well, that's what?\n\n280\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.731\nI thought it goes 300 feet.\n\n281\n00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:17.606\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> But it's 100 meters.\n\n282\n00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:20.050\n>> So we're at 600 feet or something.\n\n283\n00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.860\n>> 600 feet.\n\n284\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.830\n>> 700 feet or whatever, we're high.\n\n285\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.510\nSo what do you think he's Ronnie\nshould put in here guys, any answers?\n\n286\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.464\n>> I don't\n>> What should we put here Ronnie?\n\n287\n00:13:29.464 --> 00:13:31.225\nSerial cable?\n\n288\n00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:33.148\n>> Coax or serial?\n\n289\n00:13:33.148 --> 00:13:35.700\n>> Correct I would like that coaxial but\n\n290\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.680\nthe one I did mention I put coax in\nmy data center it only go 25 meters.\n\n291\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.570\nSo it's shortest and\nit's really high speed Really rugged,\n\n292\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.190\nand that's why I love that\ntwinax in my data centers.\n\n293\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.910\nBut in this case here, we're gonna put in\n>> Fiber, okay.\n\n294\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.040\n>> A fiber link here.\n\n295\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.050\nAnd now I'm gonna get my 40 gig link,\nor 100 gig, right?\n\n296\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.890\nSo we've got,\nI think Ronnie did pretty well.\n\n297\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:58.756\nWhat do you think we should give him?\n\n298\n00:13:58.756 --> 00:13:59.290\n>> C.\n\n299\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.010\n>> A C.\n\n300\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.554\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna go B minus, Ronnie.\n\n301\n00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:02.785\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n302\n00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:06.328\n[LAUGH] well let's move on and\nsee if he can bring up his score here.\n\n303\n00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:08.129\nNow we've got the encapsulation.\n\n304\n00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:11.457\nRemember I started this in the last\nchapter and I wanna finish this off,\n\n305\n00:14:11.457 --> 00:14:12.019\nall right.\n\n306\n00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.134\nI wanna cap this off and\n\n307\n00:14:13.134 --> 00:14:16.372\ngive you some good information\nthat you guys really understand.\n\n308\n00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:18.334\nV35 was right, David.\n\n309\n00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:19.690\nWe got some guy over here.\n\n310\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.280\n>> It is a v35 connection.\n\n311\n00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.270\nNow, so in the upper layers\nwe have our data, don't we?\n\n312\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.190\n>> This is our user\ninterface here coming in,\n\n313\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.540\ninterface right talking to our\napplications they come down.\n\n314\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:40.780\nThese presents it for changes\nare application data from our application\n\n315\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.890\n>> To four communication unto the network.\n\n316\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.250\nSo we're going to encode it, right?\n\n317\n00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.290\nSo we're gonna send it down here,\n\n318\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.830\nwe get our data,\ncome down to the transport layers.\n\n319\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.720\nSo we're sending the whole data stream\nwhile we we actually sent two pieces of\n\n320\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.290\ninformation and this is why I brought\nthis screen up because you're like\n\n321\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.520\nyou've already gone over this.\n\n322\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.940\nYes when they have more detail and the\ndetail is that when this host went here\n\n323\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.990\nand said telnet Sally, right?\n\n324\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.740\nThis is Bob of course, that'll be Bob.\n\n325\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.340\nTel met Sally, what was the first\nthing that we did, Ronnie?\n\n326\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.000\n>> Name resolution.\n\n327\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.830\n>> Name resolution.\n\n328\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.090\nSo, the first we came up with was the IP.\n\n329\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:22.249\nSo, now we need the data stream we\nseen the gas station IPs as well.\n\n330\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.180\nWe have to.\n\n331\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.210\nWe have to tell the transport layer,\nhey, transport layer,\n\n332\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.890\nhere's the data stream and send it here.\n\n333\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.250\nAnd the transport layer goes,\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n334\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.760\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n335\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.280\nHe holds onto it.\n\n336\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.340\nHold on.\n\n337\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.342\nSo the transport layer now has\ntwo pieces of information.\n\n338\n00:15:35.342 --> 00:15:39.767\nIt has the data stream and the destination\nIP address, two very important,\n\n339\n00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:41.924\nnice pieces of information to have.\n\n340\n00:15:41.924 --> 00:15:45.094\nSo the transport layer does\nwhat with that data stream?\n\n341\n00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:47.486\nWhat do you think, Ronnie?\n\n342\n00:15:47.486 --> 00:15:49.111\nThe answer's on the board.\n\n343\n00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:50.748\n[LAUGH]\n>> It breaks it up.\n\n344\n00:15:50.748 --> 00:15:51.257\n>> No, right here.\n\n345\n00:15:51.257 --> 00:15:51.931\nSegment.\n\n346\n00:15:51.931 --> 00:15:53.695\n>> Yeah, segment.\n>> It breaks it up, right, right.\n\n347\n00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:55.052\nAll right, segments it.\n\n348\n00:15:55.052 --> 00:15:58.810\nSo now we've got a segment here,\nOf that data strip.\n\n349\n00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.656\nWe can create a couple of them,\nor thousands of them, whatever.\n\n350\n00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.330\nWe put a header in front of it,\nwhether it's TCP or UDP.\n\n351\n00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.488\nSince it was telnet, that's TCP.\n\n352\n00:16:06.488 --> 00:16:12.010\nBut nonetheless, we hand them that segment\nto the network layer along with what?\n\n353\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.240\nThe destination IP.\n\n354\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.040\nHow else would the network layer,\nin this case, IP is the answer here,\n\n355\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.980\nhow else would IP know where\nto send this segment to?\n\n356\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.120\nSo we hand it down, the IP says,\nI know what to do with that IP address.\n\n357\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.110\nIt puts it in the header, and\nwe will get into the header, and\n\n358\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.010\nthe fact is now we have an IP header,\nso we'll see that here.\n\n359\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.620\nAnd this is my segment, right?\n\n360\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.170\nAnd in that header, is a field that\nsays where did I get this from.\n\n361\n00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.150\nBut nonetheless, this is now a packet.\n\n362\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.580\nAnd now, we have to determine\nwhat to do with that packet.\n\n363\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.710\nIs there a local request or\nremote request?\n\n364\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.910\nStick around for our IP routing\nepisode to answer that question.\n\n365\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.890\nIt's riveting, this section is riveting.\n\n366\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.060\nNow, we send that down once we determine\nwhat to do with a local or remote request.\n\n367\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.890\nWe're gonna send it down\nto the data link layer,\n\n368\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.810\nphysical layer, to be put on the local\nnetwork, right, whether it's Ethernet or\n\n369\n00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.050\nwireless, one or the other,\nit doesn't matter at this point.\n\n370\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.730\nSo we're looking at segments.\n\n371\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.370\nWe put the segment in a packet.\n\n372\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.960\nWe take the packet, put it inside a frame.\n\n373\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.332\nWe send down the bytes\nthat make the frame.\n\n374\n00:17:16.332 --> 00:17:19.839\nThe physical layer turns it into bits and\nencodes it within a digital or\n\n375\n00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.680\nanalog signal.\n\n376\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.740\nOkay, so during that time,\n\n377\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.640\nwe have to define the data as it's\nbeing encapsulated down the stack.\n\n378\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.920\nThis is called the encapsulation method.\n\n379\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.347\nSo the data comes down,\nso here's data, right?\n\n380\n00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:36.653\nThe data stream comes down.\n\n381\n00:17:36.653 --> 00:17:41.640\nThe transport layer segments it, but\nhold on, let's talk about addressing.\n\n382\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.120\nSo the source port, as we're gonna find\nout in the next episode, is what your host\n\n383\n00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.800\nmakes out to define the virtual circuit,\nor help define the virtual circuit.\n\n384\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.596\nThe destination port in our example,\nif we use that telnet to Sally,\n\n385\n00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:57.489\nwould be what's called\na well-known port number.\n\n386\n00:17:57.489 --> 00:18:00.877\nOkay, so well-known port\nnumbers are from 0 to 1023, and\n\n387\n00:18:00.877 --> 00:18:02.960\nthey define applications that we use.\n\n388\n00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.943\nLike for example, telnet is 23,\nHTTP is 80, ACUP is 21, and so on.\n\n389\n00:18:07.943 --> 00:18:10.610\nSo when we put those in there,\neveryone knows what we mean.\n\n390\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.640\nSo when I get to the remote host and\nwe say our destination port is 23,\n\n391\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.380\nit says you're telnet.\n\n392\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.070\nHere, send your data up to telnet.\n\n393\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.330\n>> Application telnet.\n\n394\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.020\n>> I don't run telnet?\n\n395\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.380\nDiscard, right?\n\n396\n00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:28.120\nAnyways, in this case here,\nthis is my segment that I'm carrying here.\n\n397\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.480\nThis is my TCP header because I'm running\ntelnet, and I use the addressing source.\n\n398\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.480\nI use port numbers at the transport layer.\n\n399\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.500\nAt the network layer,\nwhat type of addressing do we use, Ronnie?\n\n400\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.350\n>> IP addressing.\n\n401\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.760\n>> IP addresses, or a router protocol,\nIP or IPv6 addresses here.\n\n402\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.270\nNow if that's the case,\nhere's my segment here,\n\n403\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.470\nright, this is my segment that\nI got from the transport layer.\n\n404\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.860\nNow I'm gonna send that down, and I'm\ngonna put an IP header in front of it, and\n\n405\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.440\nnow it's called a packet.\n\n406\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.000\nNow in that's the case we have something\nin here, there's other fields in here\n\n407\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.330\nwe'll go through, time to live and\nso on, we'll go through those.\n\n408\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.350\nBut this protocol field is important\nbecause when that comes down, and\n\n409\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:12.000\nI got this from TCP, if this right here\nis gonna say who owns this segment.\n\n410\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:20.670\nAnd we're gonna put in there 6/17 and X,\nwhich is TCP and UDP, right, respectively.\n\n411\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.760\nSo it's gonna say who owns that.\n\n412\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.900\nSo when we get to the other side, and\n\n413\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.760\nthe network layer hands it to\nthe transport layer and says, this is for\n\n414\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.670\nTCP, or the network layer gets it and\nsays I need to hand this to you, TCP.\n\n415\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.690\nTCP will then look at\nthe destination port number and say,\n\n416\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.530\nI need to hand this to you, telnet.\n\n417\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.480\nSo we have to have an addressing\nat each PDU, at each layer, so\n\n418\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.640\nwe know who to hand it to when we get to\nthe destination at each respective layer.\n\n419\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.357\nSo the same thing, which we already\ntalked about as we come down to the data\n\n420\n00:19:49.357 --> 00:19:53.942\nlink layer, the ether-field will say,\nhey, so this is an IP packet.\n\n421\n00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:58.971\nAnd so in the ethernet field, it's\ngoing to be, ether type field is going\n\n422\n00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:03.860\nto be 0x800, if it was IPv6,\nit would say 0x866, all right?\n\n423\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.160\nSo that's who's gonna say who owns\nthis packet, and the reality is,\n\n424\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.530\nguys, those are pretty much\nyour only answers today.\n\n425\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:16.380\nNow, in the IP packet,\nwe might have something like ICMP, right?\n\n426\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.723\nICMP, TCP, and UDP are our most common.\n\n427\n00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:22.992\nBut you get things like EIGRP or\nIS-IS, OSPF.\n\n428\n00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:27.429\nThey have their own protocol numbers,\nas well.\n\n429\n00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:31.678\nOkay, so the port numbers\ndefine my virtual circuit.\n\n430\n00:20:35.462 --> 00:20:38.126\nAll right, so\nmy virtual circuit is created,\n\n431\n00:20:38.126 --> 00:20:42.020\nremember I send the sync saying hey,\nhere's my sequence numbers,\n\n432\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.180\nmy acknowledgement numbers,\nmy windowing, right?\n\n433\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.090\nSo I'm gonna send that over, and\nwhat does this host send back?\n\n434\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.350\nSyn Ack.\n\n435\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.767\nSay that I like, okay, but even though it\nsays a Syn Ack, and you look at that and\n\n436\n00:20:55.767 --> 00:20:57.770\ngo, they agreed with everything I said.\n\n437\n00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.510\nNo, they didn't.\n\n438\n00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.120\nThey very well may have\nchanged the window size.\n\n439\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.720\nRight, I mentioned that\ncuz I see that a lot.\n\n440\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.423\nAnyways, then we'll come back here,\nwe're gonna say okay,\n\n441\n00:21:06.423 --> 00:21:09.330\nI agree with your changes or\nif no changes, we have a relationship.\n\n442\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.740\nWe're going out on a date now.\n\n443\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:17.340\nAll right, now, so my source port is made\nup above the well-known port numbers.\n\n444\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.815\nSo my well-known port\nnumbers is 0 to 1023.\n\n445\n00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:23.945\nSo i'm gonna make up a number\nfrom 1024 to 65535, and\n\n446\n00:21:23.945 --> 00:21:28.765\nthat's gonna define me\nto the destination host.\n\n447\n00:21:28.765 --> 00:21:31.475\nNo one else can use that\nsource port number because\n\n448\n00:21:31.475 --> 00:21:34.985\nthat defines whenever they get a segment\nwith a source port number of that,\n\n449\n00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:38.920\nthey say you're part of that stream\nfrom Bob to Sally to Intelnet.\n\n450\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.528\nRight, so\nthey know how to put that back together,\n\n451\n00:21:41.528 --> 00:21:43.570\nwhich data stream to send that to.\n\n452\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.550\nThe destination port says in this case,\nthat you're going to telnet, so\n\n453\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.700\nnow the source port knows and\ncan keep the data separate, right?\n\n454\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.330\nIn this case here, so used in part\nto define the virtual circuit,\n\n455\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.450\nthis defines the upper layer process or\napplication.\n\n456\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.865\nSo the port numbers become very\nimportant within our connection.\n\n457\n00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:07.670\nOkay, one more item to talk about,\nthis is a C-sat objective.\n\n458\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.480\nNot that everything wasn't, but this is\nspecifically, they picked this out today,\n\n459\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.490\nor this morning or\nyesterday when I was reading them.\n\n460\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.280\nThey picked this out and said Cisco\nthree layer model in the hierarchical\n\n461\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.340\nthree layer model and how it works.\n\n462\n00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:25.200\nFirst off, you have three layers,\nthe core, distribution, and access.\n\n463\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.030\nNow, so the Cisco hierarchical model can\nhelp you design and maintain a scalable\n\n464\n00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.540\nand reliable and really use this\nin a larger core network, right.\n\n465\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.930\nYou're gonna use this\nin a larger enterprise.\n\n466\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.720\nYou don't have these in a small network,\nright?\n\n467\n00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.660\nWe just have one layer.\n\n468\n00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.270\nYou have your servers and\nyour Internet connection, right?\n\n469\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.920\nBut in this case here,\nwe're gonna break it up.\n\n470\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.320\nSo this is where our host come in, right?\n\n471\n00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.520\nI think we're gonna have some things\nlike here like port security.\n\n472\n00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.390\nSince we have void, we might have\nsomething like PoE here, right?\n\n473\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.320\nThis would kinda make sense.\n\n474\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.380\nThink access.\n\n475\n00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.988\nNow over here, this is where we'd have\nour routing, our inter VLAN routing,\n\n476\n00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:08.520\nand our access-list, our packet filtering.\n\n477\n00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.930\nOver here, we don't really have anything.\n\n478\n00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.190\nWe wanna keep this clean, so\n\n479\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:17.010\nwe can get from distribution closet to\ndistribution closet as fast as possible.\n\n480\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.494\nNothing to stop it,\nno access-list, no filtering,\n\n481\n00:23:21.494 --> 00:23:26.340\nbasically I don't see anything but\nLayer 2 today.\n\n482\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.840\nBecause we want this as fast as possible.\n\n483\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.890\nLet's take a look at\nsome more details here.\n\n484\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.770\nThe access layer, okay,\nI'm gonna get in some details,\n\n485\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.820\nwe're paying attention from the C-sat.\n\n486\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.100\nThe access layer provides end points in\nusers with direct access to the network.\n\n487\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:45.860\nAgain, we've got our phone here, so we're\ngonna have PoE, Brian put it up here.\n\n488\n00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.965\nPort security, and\n\n489\n00:23:46.965 --> 00:23:50.288\nwe get into port security big\ntime in the switching section.\n\n490\n00:23:50.288 --> 00:23:53.377\nDevice connectivity,\nnotice we have wireless All right,\n\n491\n00:23:53.377 --> 00:23:55.847\nwe have the wireless\ncontroller is in here, but\n\n492\n00:23:55.847 --> 00:23:59.300\nthe access points,\nbecause we're getting initial access.\n\n493\n00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.220\nWe're definitely gonna have\nsome security here, but\n\n494\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.650\nremember our access list filter doesn't\nhappen till the distribution layer.\n\n495\n00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.230\nWe want people to be able to connect,\nall right.\n\n496\n00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.940\nSo notice we have video, data, right.\n\n497\n00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.660\nWe have video and data and\nvoice, all connecting in here.\n\n498\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.240\nThat's my access layer.\n\n499\n00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.300\nThe distribution layer aggregates access\nlayers, provides connectivity to services.\n\n500\n00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.460\nWe wanna connect up.\n\n501\n00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.690\nWe don't even have to have a core,\nreally, you guys.\n\n502\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.020\nWe can collapse the core\ninto the distribution and\n\n503\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.030\nhave closet connect into closet.\n\n504\n00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.080\nAnd that's really what these\nobjectives were about when I\n\n505\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.500\nput in my book this time.\n\n506\n00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.240\nSo we have a LAN distribution switches.\n\n507\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.270\nNotice my wireless LAN controller over\nhere is connecting to my distribution\n\n508\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.710\nlayer, all right?\n\n509\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:45.690\nSo we have our WAN's coming off of here,\nconnection to the Internet.\n\n510\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:50.500\nSo these are all off of my distribution\nconnecting to my access, right?\n\n511\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.460\nAgain, what's important to understand\nis I don't have to have a core layer.\n\n512\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.750\nI can just have large distribution\nlayers connected together.\n\n513\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.930\nWhen do I have a core?\n\n514\n00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.290\nIn a large enterprise network.\n\n515\n00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.620\nYou definitely wanna do\nsomething like that, okay?\n\n516\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.830\nSo, again, let me come back here again.\n\n517\n00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.837\nRouting and packet manipulation,\nscalability, and access lists, right?\n\n518\n00:25:08.837 --> 00:25:10.170\nThat's what you wanna remember here.\n\n519\n00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:16.130\nOn the core provides connectivity, 24 hour\nconnectivity is typically layer two guys.\n\n520\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:19.560\nLarge land environments,\nhigh speed forwarding.\n\n521\n00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.330\nWe shouldn't have any, so\nthey wrote here, no ACLs.\n\n522\n00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.410\nThe core layer of the land is the critical\npart of the scalable network,\n\n523\n00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.170\nbecause really you build your network.\n\n524\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.310\nYour access going to a distribution,\nyou put a new distribution core up.\n\n525\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:37.543\nPutting a bunch of axis out,\nthat distribution connection to the core\n\n526\n00:25:37.543 --> 00:25:41.489\nautomatically connects up to\nthe enterprise, very scalable and\n\n527\n00:25:41.489 --> 00:25:44.080\nrollable and we get full tolerance.\n\n528\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.410\nNow I wanna mention something I hadn't\nmentioned in any other section.\n\n529\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.580\nI do have some questions on Lammle.com,\n\n530\n00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.140\nwhich is my website, that will go after\nmy book and will go after these videos.\n\n531\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.910\nAnd if you're reading my\nbook at this point here,\n\n532\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.790\nI didn't mention in the first chapters but\nyou have some internetworking, and\n\n533\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.850\nyou have OSI questions, and\nnow you have the ethernet.\n\n534\n00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.275\nSo if you follow along you're on\nthe ethernet section at this point and\n\n535\n00:26:11.275 --> 00:26:13.841\nthe other thing is we finished\nchapters one and two.\n\n536\n00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:16.789\nAnd we should be reading the review\nquestions, probably read the chapters\n\n537\n00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:20.810\nalong with these videos and you're gonna\nbe sitting pretty for the CCENT exam.\n\n538\n00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.640\n>> All right, well, Todd, in this\nparticular section, we wanna make sure\n\n539\n00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.960\nthat everybody understands what\nwe've also covered here, too.\n\n540\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.990\nWe learned that we actually\nbegan with taking a look in this\n\n541\n00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.850\nparticular part of the ethernet section,\nwhich is our part two.\n\n542\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.330\nAbout really the physical cabling itself\nand making sure we can distinguish those\n\n543\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:40.190\ncablings along with the specifications,\nas well as how those devices or\n\n544\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.420\nwhat devices, excuse me, we would actually\nuse with each of those cables as well.\n\n545\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.470\nWe then also took a look at\nthe idea of encapsulation and\n\n546\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.550\nthe process of encapsulation,\nand how that breaks down.\n\n547\n00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.710\nNot only in taking our data stream,\nbreaking into segments and\n\n548\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.460\nthen into packets and into frames.\n\n549\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.480\nBut also remember, each of those\ncomponents that we talked about there in\n\n550\n00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.840\nterms of the headers and\nall the breakdown there.\n\n551\n00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.370\nThose are also gonna be\nimportant as we face the exam.\n\n552\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.990\nAnd then of course, talking about the idea\nof the three layer model that Cisco would\n\n553\n00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.630\nlike you to implement if you're gonna be\nimplementing an overall design strategy.\n\n554\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.820\nThis is part of the goal,\n\n555\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.590\nis that you at least understand\nthat at the CCENT level as well.\n\n556\n00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.820\nJust understand those concepts and\ntechnologies and what Todd mentions too,\n\n557\n00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.406\nwhich is also helpful in the exam,\nmore questions that you can give yourself.\n\n558\n00:27:24.406 --> 00:27:28.290\nAnd being able to answer those correctly\nwithout guessing is really gonna help you\n\n559\n00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.680\nto build confidence and\nget ready for that exam as well.\n\n560\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.542\nSo thank you again, Todd for\nall that great information.\n\n561\n00:27:34.542 --> 00:27:36.099\nThank you also for joining us.\n\n562\n00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:39.732\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronny Wong.\n\n563\n00:27:39.732 --> 00:27:40.777\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n564\n00:27:40.777 --> 00:27:42.403\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:27:42.403 --> 00:27:45.875\nStay tuned for more CCENT here.\n\n566\n00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:53.212\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "description": "In this episode, Todd Lammle introduces layer 2 switching concepts.  He describes basic switching function of forwarding, filtering and flooding and describes how a switch builds its mac address table using the source mac address of the frame.  Also Todd describes setting up port security in both it’s default mode as well as manual configuration to set the max number of mac addresses allowed and the different actions when the port-security is violated.  He also reminds us that to clear a switch we not only need to erase the startup configuration but also the vlan.dat file from flash.",

00:00:20.980\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ngoing to continue on in our ICND1 content.\n\n4\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.940\nNow remember that what we're doing is\nwe're getting ready for that exam and\n\n5\n00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.615\nwhat we have in our studio today is\nMister SISCO himself, Todd Lammie.\n\n6\n00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:29.695\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n7\n00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:32.597\n>> Maybe a little C SISCO [LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:34.835\nAll right guys let's have some fun.\n\n9\n00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.295\nWe were doing some routing stuff.\n\n10\n00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:39.625\nRemember this is our routing and switching\ncourse and Ronnie's got that down for me.\n\n11\n00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.015\nWe're in a routing and switching course so\nwhat part are we in now.\n\n12\n00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:42.845\nSwitching.\n>> Switching.\n\n13\n00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:45.675\n>> So we're going to do\ntwo sections on switching.\n\n14\n00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:50.130\nWe're going to look at layer two switching\nfor security huge objective there.\n\n15\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.200\nAnd then inter Vlans and\nInter Vlan routing, right?\n\n16\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.150\nAnd layers three switching\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n17\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.920\nAll right let's go ahead and\n\n18\n00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.300\ntake a look by just taking a look at some\nbasic layer two switching technologies.\n\n19\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.230\nAll right, so the catalyst switches.\n\n20\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.620\nIf a post test completes,\nwe're gonna look at this right here,\n\n21\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.220\nhere's my system light right\nhere if you can see that.\n\n22\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.390\nThere's a system light right there.\n\n23\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.690\nAnd this is going to be amber while it\nboots and runs through the post-test.\n\n24\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.460\nIt takes a minute or so.\n\n25\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.860\nAnd it's gonna come up.\n\n26\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.120\nNow, if it stays amber,\ndoesn't turn green,\n\n27\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.240\nthat indicates a problem with the post or\nsomething else, and it's typically fatal.\n\n28\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.210\nWe typically have to\nthrow the switch away.\n\n29\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.160\nNow, that's kind of important on here.\n\n30\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.356\nI think that was part of the ejectors\nat one time or something.\n\n31\n00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.560\nTypically fatal, but\n\n32\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.420\nin this case here I want you to just\nunderstand if these are gig ports,\n\n33\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.540\nthis would start at gigabit zero slash\none, not gigabit zero slash zero.\n\n34\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.010\nAll right?\nSo we start at one.\n\n35\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.770\nAnd another default here is that all\nports are enabled by default so.\n\n36\n00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.710\nJust a recap from day one here.\n\n37\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.760\nHubs are just a multi port repeater.\n\n38\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.770\nIf this guy sends a digital signal,\nthis is sent here and\n\n39\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.750\nthen sent out every other port,\nthe digital signal.\n\n40\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.720\nNow, we don't segment the network.\n\n41\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.420\nIt's not a segmentation device at all.\n\n42\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.030\nAll ports are the same collusion domain.\n\n43\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.290\nOnly runs half duplex.\n\n44\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.998\nAll ports in the same Broadcast domain.\n\n45\n00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:12.600\nAnd switches, and Cisco calls this what?\n\n46\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540\nCisco calls this microsegmentation,\nwe're segmenting to the network\n\n47\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.460\non a micro scales because every\nsingle host has a switchboard.\n\n48\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.780\nWhich, first off means we can run\nfull duplex, media rate adaption,\n\n49\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.200\nmeaning that if I had a ten-megabit host,\nit could talk to a host running\n\n50\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.270\nten megabit half-duplex, it could talk to\na host running a gigabit at full-duplex.\n\n51\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.140\nThat's a very cool technology right there.\n\n52\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.280\nAll right, so\nnotice I have straight-through cable here,\n\n53\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.860\npart of the CCNA objection,\nknow auto-detect mechanisms.\n\n54\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.160\nEach segment has its own collision domain,\nmeaning it could run its full duplex.\n\n55\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.300\nBut here, this is another icon for\n\n56\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.460\na hub, which means this guy is\nonly gonna run half duplex.\n\n57\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.330\nWe'll take a look at some statistics\nagain because it's so important.\n\n58\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.930\nBut from the first day\nwe looked at statistics,\n\n59\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.490\nit showed us what happens\nif we have a duplex issue?\n\n60\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.630\nRight?\nAnd so we\n\n61\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.460\nneed to be able to verify that and\nable to pick that out.\n\n62\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.110\nSwitches supersede bridges okay.\n\n63\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.380\nSo we can see that there\nis a bridging technology.\n\n64\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.773\nAnd the reason is that's SISCO.\n\n65\n00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.930\nYou're going to see those\nterms interchangeably.\n\n66\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.180\nYou have bridges and switches and\n\n67\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.240\nespecially that's true when\nyou get a spanning tree.\n\n68\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.760\nRight we only use the term bridging for\nthe most part.\n\n69\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.630\nThere are bridges and so on.\n\n70\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.880\nBut anyways,\nlet's take a look at layer two switch.\n\n71\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.290\nIt's faster than a bridge for\na couple reasons.\n\n72\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.270\nWe have more port density, much,\nmuch faster, and they use ASICS.\n\n73\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.320\nNow the ASICS do bridging functions, and\n\n74\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.970\nwe'll find out what those\nare in the next couple slides.\n\n75\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.540\nIt operates at layer two of the OSI model.\n\n76\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.380\nWe only read the MAC addresses, and that's\nhow we filter and segment the network.\n\n77\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.930\nThe bridging functions here forward,\nfilter and flood,\n\n78\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.370\nflood is by building\nsomething called a CAM table.\n\n79\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.940\nWe call a MAC address table\nbecause that's the command\n\n80\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.230\nto see that CAM table\nshow MAC address table.\n\n81\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.540\nThat gives me a MAC address\nto port mapping right.\n\n82\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.380\nAnd we have many ports more than a bridge.\n\n83\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.990\nAnd now here's most important thing\nbridges and switches learn MAC addresses.\n\n84\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.020\nSo here a device comes in, we're\ngoing to read the source MAC address.\n\n85\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.700\nEvery time a friend comes in, the very\nfirst thing that's done is we read\n\n86\n00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.140\nthe source MAC address and\nmake sure it's in the CAM table.\n\n87\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.820\nIf not, we're gonna put it in there.\n\n88\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.040\nSo every time a friend comes in\nthe very first thing that happens\n\n89\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.360\nIs reading the source\nMAC address every time.\n\n90\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.160\nThen we run a CRC first.\n\n91\n00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.120\nWe didn't use to that, actually, we ran\nsome different LAN switching methods,\n\n92\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.540\ncut through fragment free.\n\n93\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.740\nWe only run store it forward now,\n\n94\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.550\nwhich means we're gonna run a CRC\non every frame that comes in.\n\n95\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.850\nThen we're gonna read\nthe source MAC address.\n\n96\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.980\nWhy the CRC first?\n\n97\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.400\nBecause if a fragmentation occurs,\n\n98\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.390\nwe're not gonna be able to\nget the right Mac address.\n\n99\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.190\nAll right.\n\n100\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.850\nOkay, three switch function as we discuss\nand what we're gonna go through right now\n\n101\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.790\nis address learning,\nforward filtering and loop avoidance.\n\n102\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.450\nNow not really covering\nloop avoidance in here.\n\n103\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.270\nThat's covered in the ICD2\nhowever you never know right.\n\n104\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.140\nSo what gives us loop avoidance\nby default with Cisco switches?\n\n105\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.448\n>> Spanning tree algorithm.\n\n106\n00:05:05.448 --> 00:05:06.538\n>> Okay so,\n\n107\n00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:10.770\nRonnie, do you think I have this little\nswitch at home and I plug something in and\n\n108\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.950\nthe port is amber for about a minute,\nthen turns green after about a minute.\n\n109\n00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.440\nIs that what you're talking\nabout expanding tree?\n\n110\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.600\n>> Yes.\n\n111\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.588\n>> All right, it is.\n\n112\n00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:22.193\nThank you.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n113\n00:05:22.193 --> 00:05:25.557\nwe're gonna learn in the next chapter\nhow to turn that off on a port so\n\n114\n00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:27.282\nyou don't have to wait that many.\n\n115\n00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:30.697\nBecause sometimes if the real host aborts\nwe don't really need to run an expanding\n\n116\n00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.280\ntree on them if we're not gonna\nplug another switch in there.\n\n117\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.980\nSo we're not gonna get a loop, right?\n\n118\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.300\nSo why would we wanna turn that off?\n\n119\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.790\nBecause it could time out.\n\n120\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.290\nAnd I think host could time out trying\nto get a DSP address, for example.\n\n121\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.130\nAll right.\nLearning host locations.\n\n122\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.960\nThe initial MAC address table is empty,\nso if you reboot the switch.\n\n123\n00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.440\nRemember this is held in RAM.\n\n124\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.100\nIf I reboot or power on the switch then\n\n125\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.980\nwe're going to populate it by reading the\nsource MAC address and putting them in.\n\n126\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.600\nIt would look something like this.\n\n127\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.160\nAnd it doesn't take long for\nthis to happen, a couple of seconds maybe.\n\n128\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.410\nBecause if you have Microsoft host server,\nthey're very chatty, look up an analyzer.\n\n129\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.540\nYou don't have to ping or anything.\n\n130\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.458\nYou're gonna get data.\n\n131\n00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:04.700\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n132\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.050\nSo in this case here,\nA wants to send to C.\n\n133\n00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.850\nThis is the beauty of the switch,\nright, is that A sends a frame in.\n\n134\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.800\nThe first thing that happens is we'll\nread the source MAC address and\n\n135\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.390\nmake sure that A is in here off of E0 and\nit is.\n\n136\n00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.920\nOkay, and then we're going to look up the\ndestination MAC address in the CAM table,\n\n137\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.550\ndin a din a ding, and send it out\nonly the port it's destined for.\n\n138\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.520\nSo now we're saving bandwidth,\nwe're not flooding the frame,\n\n139\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.100\nwe're only sending out the port\nto where it's destined for.\n\n140\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.670\nThe other hosts don't see it.\n\n141\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.320\nThis is a huge bandwidth savings\nwhich will really help us.\n\n142\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.140\nNow in this case, if I host D here since\nthey broadcast or multicast frame and\n\n143\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.930\nit's gonna be flooded out every port\nexcept for the one it was received on.\n\n144\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.060\nIt's on every port except for\nthe one it was received on.\n\n145\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.020\nAnd then when that answers we\nput it in the cam table so\n\n146\n00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.220\nthat when the next one comes in it\ngoes out the destination port, right?\n\n147\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.930\nNow that being said, what happens,\nRonnie, what do you think would happen if\n\n148\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.350\nD sends inter frame will read the source\nMAC address make sure it's in the cam?\n\n149\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.250\nBut the destination is not in\nthe CAM in the MAC address table.\n\n150\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.750\nWhat do you think the switch does?\n\n151\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.550\nIt just discard it like a router?\n\n152\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.370\n>> It doesn't discard it like the router.\n\n153\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.870\nA lot of times,\nusually depending on what it is,\n\n154\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.190\nif it's an unknown MAC address,\nit's going to try and act like a hub.\n\n155\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.540\n>> Okay we're going to use\na different term than that.\n\n156\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.510\n>> I know. [LAUGH] >> I'm not\nsure SISCO would accept that.\n\n157\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.240\nTry answering that on your exam.\n\n158\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.701\n[LAUGH] Go ahead.\nIt's only $150 bucks.\n\n159\n00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:28.770\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n160\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.680\nYou're best answer on the exam was\n>> One.\n\n161\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.820\n>> That was E, let's choose D [LAUGH] that\nsays floods it out all boards except for\n\n162\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.380\nthe one it was received on.\n\n163\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.030\nBut like he said, technically in\nlayman's terms, that how it happens.\n\n164\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.350\nBut we're gonna choose answer D for that.\n\n165\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.940\n>> That's what I am.\n\n166\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.580\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.140\n>> You are laymen terms, yes.\n\n168\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.630\nOkay, so, it does the same thing if\nwe receive a broadcast or multicast.\n\n169\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.097\nWe flood it, we flood it.\n\n170\n00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:54.849\nRemember we're not going to say hey we\nbroadcast that indicating that we're\n\n171\n00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:58.831\nchanging the frame and we don't want to do\nthat we're just flooding down all ports\n\n172\n00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:00.697\nexcept for the one it was received on.\n\n173\n00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:04.490\nNow NIC,\nI keep wanting to say NIC cards, right?\n\n174\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.100\nYou can't help yourself.\n\n175\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.950\nDoesn't everyone do that?\n\n176\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.770\n>> Yes.\n>> NIC cards, you get it.\n\n177\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.920\nAll right, a LAN card,\n[LAUGH] whatever, can sometimes,\n\n178\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.600\na driver can just go crazy and send out\nspurious data, I see it a lot, right?\n\n179\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.830\nI don't really sit there and\nwork on the PCs these days.\n\n180\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.540\nBut, you see it an awful lot.\n\n181\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.460\nWe've had duplex issues and so on.\n\n182\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.380\nBut, a land order can cause, and\n\n183\n00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.370\nsome other things in an application\ncan cause this, a broadcast storm.\n\n184\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.840\nMeaning that we're just sending\na lot of data out into the network.\n\n185\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.670\nAnd, this is bad if we have redundant\nlinks and no way to stop it.\n\n186\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.590\nAnd this is where my\nspanning tree comes in.\n\n187\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.390\nCuz in this case, it's gonna stop it.\n\n188\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.530\nBut broadcast storms in\nthemselves can be bad.\n\n189\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.820\nAnd you can tell when you go to the switch\nand you're gonna look at that port,\n\n190\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.540\nit should just be blinking green, right?\n\n191\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.280\nThat's indicating data.\n\n192\n00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.180\nYou're gonna see a green, amber,\ngreen, amber, green, amber, right?\n\n193\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.480\nIt's gonna be blinking really fast.\n\n194\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.700\nThen we can go look at the statistics.\n\n195\n00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.390\nAnd we'll take a look at how that happens.\n\n196\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.840\nSo The objective answer,\n\n197\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.120\nhow do you stop a broadcast storm,\nyou need some sort of layer three device.\n\n198\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.060\nLayer three device.\n\n199\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.520\nLayer three switches isn't\nnecessarily the answer,\n\n200\n00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.070\nrouter not necessarily the answer,\nany all of those are answers.\n\n201\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.310\nSo we're gonna answer more.\n\n202\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.640\nJust some layer three device is\nthe only way to stop a broadcast storm.\n\n203\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.470\nWell then you gotta go find the PC and\nunplug it.\n\n204\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.230\nSo what indicates a broadcast storm?\n\n205\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.990\nWe covered this a couple of days ago.\n\n206\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.280\nIf you were to look at an interface and\n\n207\n00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.660\non the objectives they show\nyou an output like this.\n\n208\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.500\nWhich two parameters,\nI know it's hard to tell from here,\n\n209\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.310\nwhich two parameters are going to show\nyou that you have a broadcast storm?\n\n210\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.940\nThat is you have no buffer\nbecause your buffers are full so\n\n211\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.740\nwe are dropping packets, we're not being\nable to see him, we have to ignore him, so\n\n212\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.060\nour ignoreds go into increment as well.\n\n213\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.340\nThat being said, Ronnie,\nwhat do you think if I had a duplex issue?\n\n214\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.304\nSo if, changing subjects here,\nI had a host come in here, and\n\n215\n00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:52.804\nit said half duplex, coming into a switch,\nmaybe it's set at auto and\n\n216\n00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:55.800\nI can't figure out what\nyou're trying to do.\n\n217\n00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.985\nAnd maybe it set itself as full and\nyou're at half.\n\n218\n00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:01.380\nHow can you tell by\nlooking at this you think?\n\n219\n00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.270\n>> It's gonna be the late- [CROSSTALK]\n>> It is late collisions.\n\n220\n00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.980\nAbsolutely, good job.\n\n221\n00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:09.805\nAnd you remember stuff\nthat you tell me Doug.\n\n222\n00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:11.005\n>> Sometimes, yes.\n\n223\n00:10:11.005 --> 00:10:14.305\nAnd then the input errors.\n\n224\n00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:15.928\n>> Input errors, stuff.\n\n225\n00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:17.681\n>> Right, so, we've got two.\n\n226\n00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:20.662\nAnd the other thing that you're probably\ngonna see is some sort of collisions here\n\n227\n00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:21.405\nas well obviously.\n\n228\n00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:24.560\nWe're just gonna get all\nsorts of errors again.\n\n229\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.440\nBoth of these are going to work.\n\n230\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.830\nYour network is going to work.\n\n231\n00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.430\nAll be it, very slowly.\n\n232\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.420\nNo doubt about it.\n\n233\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.804\nRight, and again we can look at the switch\nand see that it turn [INAUDIBLE].\n\n234\n00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:36.708\nNow I've had many ports connecting\nthe switch turn [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n235\n00:10:36.708 --> 00:10:37.990\nthere have been no problem.\n\n236\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.120\nNo problem with speed,\nno problem with there.\n\n237\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.520\nSo just because you see amber,\ndoesn't always indicate a problem.\n\n238\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.050\nBut that's if we got something like\nthis it will indicate a problem.\n\n239\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.650\nAnd on the CCNA that's always a problem.\n\n240\n00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.226\nAll right,\nto connect switches together remember, for\n\n241\n00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:52.420\nthe we're going to use a crossover cable.\n\n242\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.360\nIn real life, that does not happen.\n\n243\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.370\nWith any switch even if I went\ndown to Best Buy today and\n\n244\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.190\nbought two switches they'd work.\n\n245\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.080\nAt first the link lights are amber and\n\n246\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.780\nafter about a minute because\nScantree needs to converge,\n\n247\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.990\nwe'll get into that, and then turn\ngreen indicating normal operation.\n\n248\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.030\nIf it's turning green and amber,\nwe're gonna remember that.\n\n249\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.980\nThat's gonna show us our errors then we\ncan look at statistics on that port and\n\n250\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.880\nsee if it's a broadcast storm or\na duplex issue, right?\n\n251\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.680\nOkay, now to configure a switch,\nthis is actually the easy part.\n\n252\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.540\nNow I kinda had showed you guys earlier\nbecause I was in there using my\n\n253\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.360\nswitches as my DHP clients, right?\n\n254\n00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.370\nSo in this case here,\nwe want to set a static IP address.\n\n255\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.200\nNow we don't set an IP address on\na physical interface on a switch.\n\n256\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.420\nNow there is some layer three enterprise\nswitches that you can put an IP\n\n257\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.200\naddress on it, by making it a router port.\n\n258\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.360\nI don't really do that on\nmy switches all that much.\n\n259\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.815\nI usually use a router for a router.\n\n260\n00:11:42.815 --> 00:11:44.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n261\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.330\nmy switches to routing, I use routing.\n\n262\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.600\nIn the next episode\nwe'll get all into that.\n\n263\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.280\nRight, so, although you can do that,\nI don't recommend it on a lot of them.\n\n264\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.540\nYou're talking about a lot of processing.\n\n265\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.510\nHowever, to manage the switch, use some\nsort of what's called a management VLAN.\n\n266\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.780\nOr, it's also referred to\nas the native VLAN, right?\n\n267\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:07.090\nAnd, we can change this but, by default,\nit's a logical interface called VLAN one.\n\n268\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.540\nAll ports are in this, by default.\n\n269\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.310\nSo, they're in one broadcasting domain.\n\n270\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.740\nAnd so they create a routed port actually.\n\n271\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.410\nIt is a router port on there.\n\n272\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.540\nIt's a logical port called\ninterface v lan one.\n\n273\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.920\nAnd from there I can put an IP address.\n\n274\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.170\nBut don't forget, and here's one of the\nthings I do my laugh I typically forget I\n\n275\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.320\njust run in there real quick\nput an ip address on there.\n\n276\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.180\nAnd I'm so used to switches just working.\n\n277\n00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.010\nIn this case it doesn't.\n\n278\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.730\nBecause we still need to do a no shutdown.\n\n279\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.840\nAnd then we're gonna exit and\none of the things,\n\n280\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.790\nif I want to manage the switch from\na different VLAN or outside the subnet,\n\n281\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.030\nthen I'm gonna use the IP\ndefault gateway command.\n\n282\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.400\nI highly recommend doing this.\n\n283\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.270\nThis is your number one\ntroubleshooting spot on the CCNA.\n\n284\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.870\nWhy can't you manage the switch,\nthe default gateway's not set, or\n\n285\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.740\nit's set incorrectly.\n\n286\n00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.270\nWe're gonna look at that.\n\n287\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.902\nSo, if I look at Bob here, you're Bob.\n\n288\n00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:57.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, why can't Bob manage this switch?\n\n289\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.440\nWell, I might just look at the answer and\nsay,\n\n290\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.800\nthere's no default gateway or something.\n\n291\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.580\nThat's my number one\ntroubleshoot same spot but\n\n292\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.210\nin this case here I'm gonna look\nat the output of the shell run.\n\n293\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.880\nThere's nothing here that indicates\nthere's a default gateway set.\n\n294\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.110\nSo you can manage this switch,\njust not outside your LAN or your VLAN.\n\n295\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.110\nSo I'm just showing you this picture.\n\n296\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.900\nIt's important that you remember that\nyou check the full gateway switch.\n\n297\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.330\nTo set a switch back to factory default.\n\n298\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.080\nAlmost factory defaults,\na restart reload just like a router.\n\n299\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.450\nNow that sets a router completely\nback to factory defaults.\n\n300\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.817\nNot this one though because if we create\nwhich we'll learn in the next episode,\n\n301\n00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:39.003\nthey're stored in flash\nin a file named vlan.dat.\n\n302\n00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:44.440\nSo you could type this erase Flash.\n\n303\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.300\nDo me a favor.\n\n304\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.725\nDon't type erase Flash enter.\n\n305\n00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:48.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, that's gonna give you a bad day.\n\n306\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.640\nMake sure you do colon, question mark.\n\n307\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.250\nLook for vlan.dat and erase it.\n\n308\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.080\nDoes this delete your VLAN database?\n\n309\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.200\nMost of the time.\n\n310\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.075\nIt doesn't delete it every time I do it,\nthough.\n\n311\n00:13:57.075 --> 00:13:57.810\n[LAUGH] I gotta tell you.\n\n312\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.780\nNow, that was kind of\nimportant what we went though.\n\n313\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.480\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nconfigure our switches here in a minute\n\n314\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.210\nwith some management stuff so\nwe can manage it.\n\n315\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.200\nPretty simple.\n\n316\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.820\nNot that much different than a router.\n\n317\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.730\nThe only thing is for the management we\ncan put it under the logical interface,\n\n318\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.470\nbut I'm gonna show you how\nto change the native VLAN.\n\n319\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.490\nThat's very important.\n\n320\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.240\nNow in this case here though,\nin this one episode,\n\n321\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.970\nthe most important\nobjective is right here.\n\n322\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.100\nPort security.\n\n323\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:26.280\nAll right so port security allows me\nto manage a switch via MAC address.\n\n324\n00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.250\nAnd allow it, in other words,\n\n325\n00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.960\nI can say what MAC addresses\ncan come in on a certain port?\n\n326\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.610\nSo, on any Cisco port,\n\n327\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.800\nfor most switches, you can have up to\n1022 MAC addresses associated to a port.\n\n328\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.370\n>> Hm.\n>> That's a lot, right?\n\n329\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.580\nSo, [COUGH] that's pretty much\nour limit with an ethernet.\n\n330\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.360\nBut, we might not want Bob here, [LAUGH]\nthere's Bob we don't trust Bob at all so\n\n331\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.330\nwe don't want Bob to be\nable to come in here and\n\n332\n00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.910\nbring a hub or his little wireless modem\nbecause he wants to sit outside at lunch.\n\n333\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.070\nBecause the minute someone adds\nsomething into your cubicle a wireless.\n\n334\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.010\nNow someone just has like\nan Ethernet jack in your parking lot\n\n335\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.930\ninside your network past your\nsecurity parameters, right?\n\n336\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.050\nAns so we want to lock down our ports.\n\n337\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.410\nNow there's a couple different\nways we can do this.\n\n338\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.400\nWe can use static learning, in other\nwords we can put in the mac address and\n\n339\n00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.780\nsay, only this MAC address can be on here.\n\n340\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.650\nWe can do this dynamically, and\njust learn it and then save it, or\n\n341\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.190\ndo a combination of static and dynamic.\n\n342\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.820\nBut also, one of the things I\nmostly do is none of those.\n\n343\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.170\nI usually use something\ncalled sticky learning.\n\n344\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.510\nAnd we're gonna go head and\ntake a look at that.\n\n345\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.060\nThis gives me static MAC addresses,\n\n346\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.500\nit gives me static learning\nwithout having to do all the work.\n\n347\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.700\nCuz I'm really into that,\n\n348\n00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.710\ngetting stuff done without\nactually having to work at it.\n\n349\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.840\nAll right, let me show you how to do that.\n\n350\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.450\nAll right, so first off, I've got four\nsteps here on how you have to do this.\n\n351\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.450\nAnd you're gonna remember the defaults,\nright?\n\n352\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.050\nRemember the defaults,\nI'm gonna test you on that, Ronnie.\n\n353\n00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.740\n>> Okay.\n>> So we're gonna talk about that.\n\n354\n00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.620\nFirst off I have to come in here and\nenable port security.\n\n355\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.618\nSo, notice I'm doing this on a port now.\n\n356\n00:15:55.618 --> 00:16:00.552\nI got to be honest with you,\nI typically go into a switch and\n\n357\n00:16:00.552 --> 00:16:07.939\nI'll say something like this,\ninterface range F, 0 5/F, 0, 20, whatever.\n\n358\n00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:11.529\nThat allows me to configure all the ports\nat the same time if I'm going to configure\n\n359\n00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:12.770\nthem the same way.\n\n360\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.410\nSo, let's go take a look at this.\n\n361\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.990\nThe first thing I want to do is I\nhave to make the port an access port.\n\n362\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.120\nNow, I know in the next episode we're\ngoing to talk about, access and\n\n363\n00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.020\ntrunk port.\n\n364\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.970\nBut an access port is a port that's\na member of one VLAN, right?\n\n365\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.160\nThat's a host port that comes in and\nis a member of a VLAN slash subnet.\n\n366\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.920\nSo we're gonna make it, and the reason and\nwe'll learn in the next episode as well is\n\n367\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.850\nwhy do we have to type that in because\nthey're not access ports by default.\n\n368\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.720\nSo we're gonna have to\nmake it an access port, or\n\n369\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.370\nwe can't do port security on that port.\n\n370\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.500\nOkay so switchport and\nthen we enable port security.\n\n371\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.830\nLet's talk about that,\nthat's all I have to do.\n\n372\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.360\nMake an access port switch\nto port security, Enter.\n\n373\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.890\nI have enabled port security on there and\nthere are two parameters.\n\n374\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.180\nIt allows one maximum\nMAC address at a time.\n\n375\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.960\nNow the problem with that is I can\n\n376\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.970\nhave any MAC address it doesn't\nmatter as long it is one at a time.\n\n377\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.890\nIf two showed up, then we're gonna set\na violation mode to punish the user,\n\n378\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.900\nI'm into punishing my users here.\n\n379\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.020\nPorts, so notice this is kind of\nredundant, because it says switch for\n\n380\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.990\na port security, it's already\nmaxed when that's the default.\n\n381\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.190\nYou need to remember that,\nbecause when they ask you a question,\n\n382\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.970\nyou have that foundation.\n\n383\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.700\nThey're gonna say, hey what happens here?\n\n384\n00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.400\nYou have to know that there's\na default is maximum one,\n\n385\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.370\nand the violation is shut down.\n\n386\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.760\nThat's also the default.\n\n387\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.060\nSo the punishment for the users,\nwe're gonna shut down their port.\n\n388\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.640\nWe're gonna put in air disabled mode and\nit's gonna turn amber.\n\n389\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.270\nSo those are the defaults.\n\n390\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.420\nMaximum one,\nviolation shut down, all right?\n\n391\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.570\nNow I got to be honest with you,\nI don't know if I had\n\n392\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.470\nI don't know if I have, and\nwanna do this in production.\n\n393\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.240\nYou really wanna have to do this.\n\n394\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.790\nYou really wanna control your\nusers to do this, and here's why.\n\n395\n00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.080\nIf I set this to shut down,\nyour phone's gonna ring all the time.\n\n396\n00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.050\nAnd the way you have to go out\nto the port do a shut no shut.\n\n397\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:01.810\nOkay?\n\n398\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.210\nAnd so, I don't want to do that,\n\n399\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.760\nI want to create the same thing\nwithout the users calling me.\n\n400\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.950\nSo I'm going to show you how to do that,\ngive you the same security.\n\n401\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.360\nBefore I do that though, we've got our\ndefaults, you've got to remember, maximum\n\n402\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.440\none, violation shut down, so if two MAC\naddresses come into that port at the same\n\n403\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.570\ntime, that's gonna put the port in their\ndisabled to turn amber, all right?\n\n404\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.870\nThat's the default.\n\n405\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.950\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nplay with that a little bit, but\n\n406\n00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.530\nthe other thing here that I\ndefinitely use is MAC address sticky.\n\n407\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:33.330\nAnd what this says is,\nI want to do static MAC addressing.\n\n408\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.180\nI only want to allow that MAC address in,\nbut I don't want to type it in, right?\n\n409\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.910\nSo that's a lot of, if you had thousands\nof hosts Isn't that a lot of work?\n\n410\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.010\nYeah, it is, right?\n\n411\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:42.670\nIt's a full time job.\n\n412\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.960\nIf you get a way with it and\nyou're getting good bucks,\n\n413\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.780\nthen tell them you need to do\nstatic MAC addressing, right?\n\n414\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.240\nThat's gonna take you a couple years.\n\n415\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.830\nAnyways,Maximum 1.\n\n416\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.210\nSo what's gonna happen\nwith this Maximum 1,\n\n417\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.630\nagain, I don't even need to type those in.\n\n418\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.790\nThose are the defaults.\n\n419\n00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.030\nIf I just came in here and\nsaid violation, I'm sorry,\n\n420\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.090\nMAC address sticky, the other two are\ngonna be there whether I see them or not.\n\n421\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:05.420\nAnd so say MAC address sticky here,\nwhat that means is learn, and\n\n422\n00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.290\nput into the running config that MAC\naddress is up to the maximum allowed,\n\n423\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:13.660\nwhich is one here, and put that into the\nrunning config as a static MAC address.\n\n424\n00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.970\nNow, if a different MAC address comes in\nat any time, it's going to shut it down.\n\n425\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.682\nIt doesn't even have to be two.\n\n426\n00:19:18.682 --> 00:19:22.896\nIt has to just be any, that same MAC\naddress or it shuts down the port.\n\n427\n00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:23.628\nThat's pretty tight guys.\n\n428\n00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:26.717\nThat's pretty,\nyou might not wanna do that.\n\n429\n00:19:26.717 --> 00:19:28.539\nIt depends on your situation.\n\n430\n00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:31.279\nNow to display the port settings,\nnow hold on.\n\n431\n00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:32.242\nYou have to go through this.\n\n432\n00:19:32.242 --> 00:19:35.176\nThe port security shows enabled here.\n\n433\n00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:35.999\nSee that?\n\n434\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.050\nThat is only, this is one of\nyour troubleshooting spots when\n\n435\n00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.790\nyou're troubleshooting port\nsecurity on the CNA objectives.\n\n436\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.510\nThe point is that if someone goes in\nthere and just puts the parameters in.\n\n437\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.100\nLet's say you go into interface F01 or\nwhatever, and\n\n438\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.250\nyou say switch port maximum to\nviolation shut down and so on.\n\n439\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.080\nYou put those in, this is gonna show\ndisabled and port security's not disabled.\n\n440\n00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.150\nSo I have to do this.\n\n441\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.710\nI have to type.\n\n442\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.250\nI have to enable port security by saying\n\n443\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.030\nswitch port port security\nenter on that interface level.\n\n444\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.260\nOr this isn't gonna show enabled here.\n\n445\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.800\nYou have to know that for\nthe exam objectives.\n\n446\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.090\nOkay, now notice this is secure up.\n\n447\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.210\nThis will say secure down or\nerror disable depending on your iOS\n\n448\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.800\nif you are in violation and\nyou had a shutdown in there.\n\n449\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:32.390\nViolation mode is shutdown, maximum MAC\naddresses are 1, and we can see that\n\n450\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.500\nif we get a violation count, if something\nhappens, we'll see they had a violation.\n\n451\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.240\nBut, since you had violation shutdown,\nyou don't need this.\n\n452\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.800\nYou're gonna know it,\nbecause your phone is gonna ring.\n\n453\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, now we're not gonna do that.\n\n454\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.470\nI'm gonna do other things.\n\n455\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.250\nLet me show other ways to do this,\n\n456\n00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.620\naccomplish the same security\nwithout making a phone ring.\n\n457\n00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.280\nAll right, cuz that's what I'm into.\n\n458\n00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.850\nThe less work the better, the less\nusers calling me, my life is better.\n\n459\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.600\nAll right first off, I did a range.\n\n460\n00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.420\nI'm doing 12 ports at the same time.\n\n461\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.160\nI put it in the access mode and\nenabled port-security.\n\n462\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.190\nIf I leave after doing that and\nI get a call and say shoot,\n\n463\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.700\nswitchport mode access,\nswitchport port-security, Enter and then I\n\n464\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.750\nleave because I have just remember it's\nhappy hour down at Chili's or something.\n\n465\n00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.310\nWhat did my switch test do, Ronnie?\n\n466\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.424\n>> It just put it into\nthe default modes for\n\n467\n00:21:22.424 --> 00:21:25.230\nall the configurations\nthere that it needs to.\n\n468\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.410\n>> And\nthe defaults of port security are what?\n\n469\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.500\n>> It's gonna be a maximum of one and\nshutdown violation.\n\n470\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.830\n>> Violation and shutdown.\n\n471\n00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.879\nRight, we're gonna punish those users for\ngood [LAUGH] by shutting down their port.\n\n472\n00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:38.920\nYou guys can do that.\n\n473\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.540\nI'm just warning you that\nthese guys are gonna do this.\n\n474\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.820\nSo, what about if these guys go out and\ndo this, and now they have to call you?\n\n475\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.700\nThey're feeling really bad,\nbecause if they do it all the time,\n\n476\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.190\nmaybe that's a problem.\n\n477\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.830\nBut it could happen every once in a while.\n\n478\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.100\nMaybe it's better that it drops it.\n\n479\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.880\nThey're not gonna call you if\nit just drops the packet, so\n\n480\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.600\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n481\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.500\nSwitchboard mode, access port security.\n\n482\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.290\nWe know the default so let's change them.\n\n483\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.190\nSo I'm going to say switchboard\nport security maximum.\n\n484\n00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.080\nNow, if I have a phone.\n\n485\n00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.100\nI have my PC plugged into my phone, and\n\n486\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.140\na phone into the port,\nthat's three MAC addresses probably,\n\n487\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.160\nbecause you have a switch in back\nof the phone, that's a MAC address.\n\n488\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.830\nThe phone's gonna have one and\nthe PC's gonna have one, so\n\n489\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.990\nthat's three, typically three,\nso you could try two and\n\n490\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.710\nsee if that works,\ndepending on which phone you have.\n\n491\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.450\nI've seen it done as two or three.\n\n492\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.690\nSo maximum Let's say two, right,\nyou try that and it doesn't work,\n\n493\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.960\nyou just go through and\nchange it to three.\n\n494\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.600\nViolation mode, now,\nthere's three different violation modes.\n\n495\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:42.560\nThere's restrict, protect, and\nthen the shut down, right.\n\n496\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.370\nNow, the difference between these\nis I typically set it to protect.\n\n497\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.190\nWhy?\n\n498\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.740\nBecause I don't wanna know about anything,\nI just want it to work.\n\n499\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:56.680\nSo I can come in here and say, switchport\nport-security MAC-address sticky and\n\n500\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.060\nit's gonna learn up to the match\nroom which is two in this case.\n\n501\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.350\nIf they go passed that, and\nI if do this attack it just drops\n\n502\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.170\nany MAC address that comes in other\nthan those two that are learned.\n\n503\n00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.610\nAnd it just keeps dropping them,\nit will never work.\n\n504\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.260\nThey're not gonna call and go, hey I'm\ntrying to get this lynxes access point\n\n505\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.150\nconnected in to my, yeah,\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n506\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.200\nThey're not gonna call you.\n\n507\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.550\nSo now you just gave yourself security\nwithout the users abusing you, right?\n\n508\n00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.720\nSo anyways.\n\n509\n00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.160\nSo this is kind of what I do to protect.\n\n510\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.280\nNow why would I use restrict?\n\n511\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.460\nIt's the same thing.\n\n512\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.120\nBut it sends you and S&MP trap and\n\n513\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.420\nincrements the security violation\ncounter that I showed you earlier.\n\n514\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.670\nSo the restrict is going to increment\nthe counter and send you an S&MP trap.\n\n515\n00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.800\nI may not want to know it,\n\n516\n00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.440\nbut maybe you do if you you have constant\nviolations, find out who they are, and\n\n517\n00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.970\nif that's against company policy,\nthen that's gonna be a problem.\n\n518\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.350\nBut shutdown is, it's rough guys.\n\n519\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.902\nBecause you think that's not a problem\nI'll find to it, no it is a problem.\n\n520\n00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:55.877\n[LAUGH] So I usually use Protect because,\nI don't really know,\n\n521\n00:23:55.877 --> 00:23:57.452\nI just want to security.\n\n522\n00:23:57.452 --> 00:23:58.357\nI know it's giving it to me.\n\n523\n00:23:58.357 --> 00:23:59.913\nIt's giving me everything but\nI don't want to hear anything about it.\n\n524\n00:23:59.913 --> 00:24:01.631\nI got other things I got to do, right?\n\n525\n00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:04.940\nNow, let's go thru these\nviolation modes one more time.\n\n526\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.460\nSee stay objective right here.\n\n527\n00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.490\nProtect.\n\n528\n00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.080\nAll right.\nThis will permit traffic from\n\n529\n00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.668\nknown MAC addresses while dropping\ntraffic from unknown MAC addresses.\n\n530\n00:24:13.668 --> 00:24:15.080\nSo I do my sticky, I get them,\n\n531\n00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.310\nthey put them in the running config,\neverything works great.\n\n532\n00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.750\nAnd anything past those,\nthe data's just dropped.\n\n533\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.560\nIt doesn't shut down the port.\n\n534\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.010\nYou know, it just doesn't work.\n\n535\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:24.800\nAll right.\n\n536\n00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.652\nRestrict does the same thing but\n\n537\n00:24:26.652 --> 00:24:30.410\nwhen configured, it says log message,\nokay, almost forgot about that.\n\n538\n00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.222\nWe send a cis log and an SNMP trap.\n\n539\n00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:36.060\nOkay, remember that.\n\n540\n00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.980\nRestrict and\nshut down sends a cis log and SNMP Trap.\n\n541\n00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.620\nThey both do that.\n\n542\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.530\nAll right?\n\n543\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.628\nAnd the violation counter is incremented.\n\n544\n00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:46.760\nRight so I can use restrict and\nget some information but\n\n545\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.810\nat least the user isn't going to call\nme because I shut down the port.\n\n546\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.340\nSo if you want to get some\ninformation then we'll use restrict.\n\n547\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.580\nIf you want to get no\ninformation we'll use protect.\n\n548\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.890\nSo what two violation modes give you\nan SNMP trap, that answer is shut down and\n\n549\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.150\nrestrict, shut down and\nrestrict, remember that.\n\n550\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:07.410\nOkay to verify this I'm going to use show\nport security interface and the interface.\n\n551\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:08.490\nAnd notice it's enabled.\n\n552\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.210\nWhy is this enabled?\n\n553\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.760\nBecause I did switchboard port\nsecurity enter on the port.\n\n554\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.920\nSo, I enabled it.\n\n555\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.270\nThe defaults are maximum one and\nviolation shut down.\n\n556\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.940\nOkay.\nSo, notice this one's restrict.\n\n557\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.750\nThat's fine.\n\n558\n00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:25.540\nI'm gonna send an SNMP assist log and\nupdate my security violation counter.\n\n559\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.880\nNotice I have maximum Mac address is two.\n\n560\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.990\nI've only got one associated to here.\n\n561\n00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.210\nAnd I have a sticky.\n\n562\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:33.990\nSo if I come over here and\n\n563\n00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.320\nI do a show run over here, I can see\nthat the address it shows up here.\n\n564\n00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.700\nNow if I need to change that I need\nto go underneath that interface and\n\n565\n00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.560\nsay no in front of this whole command.\n\n566\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.410\nSo that's when we use our\ncopy paste again isn't it?\n\n567\n00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.250\nAll right.\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n568\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.220\ntake a look at our lab guys.\n\n569\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.740\nI have three switches here, and I'm\njust gonna go ahead and configure this.\n\n570\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.450\nI'll just go to switch one,\nright here, and we're gonna configure\n\n571\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.800\nthe administrative functions on there,\ncreate the VLAN, change our native VLAN.\n\n572\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.310\nWe'll talk more about the native\nVLAN in the next episode.\n\n573\n00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:09.030\nBut, nonetheless, we'll start it now,\nand then I'm going to set my SNMP.\n\n574\n00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.210\nI'm sorry, my port security.\n\n575\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.548\nSo let's go ahead and take a look,\nI think switch's one's down here.\n\n576\n00:26:15.548 --> 00:26:16.048\nYup.\n\n577\n00:26:19.658 --> 00:26:20.665\nNope that's switch eight.\n\n578\n00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:23.170\n[LAUGH] I can't even read that.\n\n579\n00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.190\nHow are you guys gonna read it.\n\n580\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:28.410\nAll right.\n\n581\n00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.510\nSo since I don't have anything\nconfigured on here but the host name but\n\n582\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.070\nagain, switches are up and running.\n\n583\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.180\nI don't have to do a lot of work.\n\n584\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.760\nSo I wanna say show IP int brief.\n\n585\n00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.680\nCheck this out guys,\nwe're gonna get some information there.\n\n586\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.470\nNow it's got an IP address but\nthat was from when we did our DHP lab.\n\n587\n00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.370\nThere's my ten dot three.\n\n588\n00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.770\nI got our DHCP lab so\nthat's where I got that from.\n\n589\n00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.580\nSo notice it says over here method DHCP,\nright so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n590\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.860\nset that statically.\n\n591\n00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.800\nSo it's Vlan1,\nnow we don't have to use Vlan1.\n\n592\n00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.060\nThat's my management,\nwe can easily change that.\n\n593\n00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:05.260\nThis is a routed port so I'm gonna put\nan IP address underneath there and\n\n594\n00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.070\nthat's my logical port but\nwe can change that.\n\n595\n00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.540\nBut let's for now.\n\n596\n00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.590\nI'm gonna come in here and\nI don't want to get it from\n\n597\n00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.834\ninterface Vlan 1, interface Vlan 1.\n\n598\n00:27:18.834 --> 00:27:19.660\nDid I type that wrong?\n\n599\n00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.680\nI forgot the end.\n\n600\n00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.900\nOkay interface Vlan 1 and now I'm\ngonna go ahead and put my IP address.\n\n601\n00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.800\nNow I'm just gonna type the same thing\nbecause that's the address I want.\n\n602\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.160\nCuz, I'm not using that.\n\n603\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.050\nActually ,we could use,\nI'm using 17, 18, 19.\n\n604\n00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:37.060\nRemember, this is a separate subdomain\nI'm gonna put my management in.\n\n605\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.980\nI'm looking at my figure, and\nI use this 240 mass, so and\n\n606\n00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.170\nI use, so this is, I'm using this\nbecause this is what's in my book.\n\n607\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.980\nSo if you're following along from\nthe book then this is gonna match.\n\n608\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.830\nSo, Switch one 192.168.10.17 / 28,\nand don't forget we'd have to do, it's\n\n609\n00:27:54.210 --> 00:28:00.606\ngetting rid of the DHCP, it's probably\ntelling the pool to release that address.\n\n610\n00:28:00.606 --> 00:28:07.560\n[LAUGH] All right,\nno it didn't like that too much did it?\n\n611\n00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.160\n>> No.\n>> I wanna be DHCP.\n\n612\n00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.920\nI wanna DHCP client.\n\n613\n00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.700\nNo, don't forget to enable the port.\n\n614\n00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.820\nIn this case it was already enabled but,\nman you got to remember this.\n\n615\n00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.590\nYou learn that the hard way.\n\n616\n00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.170\nNo shut.\n\n617\n00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:22.330\nAnd then guys I'm going to do an exit and\nan IP default.\n\n618\n00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:28.770\nI said the word default but\nthen started typing something else.\n\n619\n00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.033\nDefault gateway.\n\n620\n00:28:30.033 --> 00:28:30.560\n192.168.10.1, okay.\n\n621\n00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.990\nSo I have to do this\nback at global config,\n\n622\n00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.400\nnot underneath the interface, and\nI set the default gateway so I could.\n\n623\n00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.333\nNow remember this is nothing to do with\npeople sending frames in there in their\n\n624\n00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:44.300\nabsence, it has to do\nwith management traffic.\n\n625\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.850\nOkay, so I set my default gateway.\n\n626\n00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.860\nNow I want to do something else.\n\n627\n00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.490\nI want to do port security,\nso I'm going to do, so\n\n628\n00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.880\nI have my IP address I can set my\npassword to the same as the router.\n\n629\n00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.272\nI don't really need to\nshow you all this stuff,\n\n630\n00:28:56.272 --> 00:28:59.300\nbecause it's absolutely\neverything is the same.\n\n631\n00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.040\nNow, on this case here, I want to\ndo port security, so what do I do?\n\n632\n00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.820\nFirst thing I need to\ndo is go to my ports,\n\n633\n00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.900\nwhere I'm gonna do port security,\nand make them an access port.\n\n634\n00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.750\nAll right?\nSo I want to make sure I don't do my\n\n635\n00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.940\nuplinks I'm only going to do this on\nthe ports where my host is plugged on.\n\n636\n00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.270\nSo what I'm gonna say is,\ninterface f zero.\n\n637\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.220\nLet's see if that works.\n\n638\n00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.360\nNo, didn't like that.\n\n639\n00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.010\nIt's kind of weird on different IOses.\n\n640\n00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.710\nOops.\n\n641\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.010\nI forgot the range command.\n\n642\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.780\nThere we go.\n\n643\n00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.900\nOkay, config-if-range.\n\n644\n00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.190\nNow I'm configuring all 12\nports at the same time.\n\n645\n00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.170\nAnd this is kind of important here.\n\n646\n00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.080\nSo I'm gonna say, port security.\n\n647\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.540\nNope, sorry.\n\n648\n00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.180\nSwitchboard port, well no,\nlet's try to put it on port security.\n\n649\n00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.120\n>> See why I put that access port first.\n\n650\n00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.770\nWhich is why command rejected,\nI am rejected.\n\n651\n00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:56.860\nFastEthernet 0/1 is a dynamic port, it\nterminated because it failed, it failed.\n\n652\n00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.890\nSo that's why we do\nthe switchport mode access.\n\n653\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.052\nI can't do it while it's,\n\n654\n00:30:01.052 --> 00:30:04.180\na switchboard by default is\nsomething called dynamic desirable.\n\n655\n00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.910\nI desire to trunk, if you're another\nCisco router, let's trunk, right?\n\n656\n00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.220\nI desire it, all right?\n\n657\n00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.040\nSo, we'll get to that in the next section.\n\n658\n00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.220\nAnyways, I make it an access port.\n\n659\n00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.110\nAnd now I can turn on port-security.\n\n660\n00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.350\nNow we can head over to Chili's for\nour tequila shots there buddy.\n\n661\n00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.010\nCuz we have port-security now.\n\n662\n00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.390\n>> You do.\nBut it is set in its default\n\n663\n00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:26.090\nconfiguration and it's gonna default\nto a maximum of one MAC address.\n\n664\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.710\nAnd then also it's gonna shut\ndown if it violates that.\n\n665\n00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.290\n>> That's right.\n\n666\n00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.350\nIf someone violates that the user\nwill be completely annihilated and\n\n667\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.885\npunished with a shut down.\n\n668\n00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:36.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's what we like to do,\n\n669\n00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.560\npunish our users.\n\n670\n00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.960\nRight?\n\n671\n00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.369\nWe need to show them every once\nin a while we're in charge.\n\n672\n00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:41.960\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n673\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.424\n>> When we get to NAT I'm gonna show you\nhow to be in charge on a Monday morning.\n\n674\n00:30:44.424 --> 00:30:45.647\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me tell you.\n\n675\n00:30:45.647 --> 00:30:48.075\n[LAUGH] You do this,\nthey won't know you did it.\n\n676\n00:30:48.075 --> 00:30:49.706\n[LAUGH]\n>> You will be in charge.\n\n677\n00:30:49.706 --> 00:30:50.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n678\n00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.140\n[LAUGH] They're definitely gonna\nrespect you after that one.\n\n679\n00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.650\nAll right.\nSwitchport port-security.\n\n680\n00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.170\nWell let's do some parameters though.\n\n681\n00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.290\nWhat do you say?\n\n682\n00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.420\nGo over here a little bit more.\n\n683\n00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.100\nLet me go a little slower so\nI can get this.\n\n684\n00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:08.210\nOkay switch port,\nport security, maximum two.\n\n685\n00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.880\nOkay?\n\n686\n00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.540\nAnd then the other thing I'm gonna do is.\n\n687\n00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.850\nPort security mac address sticky.\n\n688\n00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.320\nSo I'm going to use MAC address,\nput it in the running config.\n\n689\n00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.690\nThis is kinda tough too guys because if\nsomeone has a new PC they gotta call you.\n\n690\n00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.560\nRight, because you're saying\nI want static MAC addressing.\n\n691\n00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.580\nThat's some tough security.\n\n692\n00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.299\nAnd then we're going to punish\nthe users if they violate that.\n\n693\n00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.748\nTotally into punishment here.\n\n694\n00:31:33.748 --> 00:31:37.630\nWhats that violation?\n\n695\n00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.060\nViolation we can do restrict or protect.\n\n696\n00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.940\nI can't remember the differences\nbetween restrict and protect do you?\n\n697\n00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.890\n>> Protect is the one that doesn't\nactually tell you anything.\n\n698\n00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.570\n>> That's right,\nwe like protect for that reason.\n\n699\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.820\n>> And then restrict sends chat messages.\n\n700\n00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.740\n>> Right smp and syslog and one more thing\n>> Log increments?\n\n701\n00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.450\n>> Yes it is a log,\nincrements the violation counter.\n\n702\n00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.580\n>> That's right\n>> So we do get information, but\n\n703\n00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.240\nthen again it doesn't shut down the port.\n\n704\n00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.510\nSo we like that.\n\n705\n00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.800\nOkay, so I'm going to hit violation,\n\n706\n00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.830\nI don't wanna hear anything from anybody,\nright.\n\n707\n00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.940\n>> We're just going to make them not work.\n\n708\n00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.340\nDon't call me, I'll call you.\n\n709\n00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.220\nNow, so we got sticky, maximum two.\n\n710\n00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.300\nIf they have to add another PC,\nreplace one out, you gotta go in there and\n\n711\n00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.320\ntake that out of the running config.\n\n712\n00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.930\nSo there is some effort with that.\n\n713\n00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.690\nBut you have pretty good security here,\nI'd think.\n\n714\n00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:24.790\nDon't you?\n\n715\n00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.070\nAlright, we're going to go ahead and\nfinish this up.\n\n716\n00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.336\nRight now we're all the way\nthrough chapter 10 of my book, and\n\n717\n00:32:31.336 --> 00:32:35.228\nthen we're going to go into v lans in or\nv lans routing, [INAUDIBLE] and IV6.\n\n718\n00:32:35.228 --> 00:32:40.818\nBut in this case here, go all the way\nthrough chapter 10 review questions,\n\n719\n00:32:40.818 --> 00:32:43.658\nwritten labs, and also lamley.com.\n\n720\n00:32:43.658 --> 00:32:46.160\nYou're going to be doing\nlayer two switching.\n\n721\n00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.200\nOkay here to wrap things up is Mr. Ronnie.\n\n722\n00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.440\nAll right remember what we actually\ntook a look at in this episode,\n\n723\n00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.270\nthe basic concept of the switch.\n\n724\n00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.170\nMake sure you understand of course that\nthe switch itself really does three\n\n725\n00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.750\nthings for us which is to ford, flood, or\n\n726\n00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.220\nfilter the actual traffic\ndata that comes through.\n\n727\n00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.160\nAnd also of course the way that\nthe switch itself builds MAC addresses or\n\n728\n00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.060\nMAC address table is to actually do\nit on the source MAC address as well.\n\n729\n00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.740\nThen Todd also of course introduced us\nto the concept here of port security,\n\n730\n00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.600\nmaking sure that we understand that\nit does have a default configuration\n\n731\n00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.680\nwhen you just type in that\nswitchport port-security.\n\n732\n00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.050\nBut then we can manually configure\nit the way that we want to.\n\n733\n00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.530\nAnd we may choose one of those\nthree options in the violation mode\n\n734\n00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:29.290\nwhether to protect, restrict,\nor shut down as well.\n\n735\n00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.490\nWell that's a great place for us to go\nahead and wrap up this episode then.\n\n736\n00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.280\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n737\n00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.490\n>> And I'm Todd Lammle.\n\n738\n00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:43.836\n>> And we'll see you next

          "description": "In this episode, Cisco Expert, Todd Lammle discusses the use of vlans and demonstrates it’s configuration.  Multiple vlans can exist on a single switch and a single vlan can span across multiple switches, according to Mr. Lammle.  He also emphasizes the use of trunking to allow for access to different vlans on different switches.  He also demonstrates how to configure both trunks and vlans.  Todd also shows us how to get data from one vlan to another vlan using IVR, inter-vlan routing.  He demonstrates the IVR configuration using ROAS as well as on a layer 3 switch.  The use of native vlans in 802.1q is also an objective topic emphasized that Todd describes and demonstrates.",

00:00:20.109\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're gonna go into some ICND1 content,\n\n4\n00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.010\ngetting ready for\nthat new exam that's just come out.\n\n5\n00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.130\nAnd in our studios today is gonna be,\nwell, Mr. Todd Lammle, helping us out.\n\n6\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.910\nSir Todd, welcome back to our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.980\n>> [LAUGH] That's a great intro.\n\n8\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.600\nAll right guys,\n\n9\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.382\nwe're gonna take off from our last\nepisode where we were doing VLANS.\n\n10\n00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:38.490\nWe're gonna do VLANS and\ninter-VLAN routing,\n\n11\n00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.940\nusing both a router and a layer 3 switch.\n\n12\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.850\nLayer 3 switch is the way to go for\ninter-VLAN routing.\n\n13\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.525\nBut first let's talk about what a VLAN is,\nlet's hit some objectives guys.\n\n14\n00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:50.342\nOkay, so first off we have a VLAN here.\n\n15\n00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.897\nA VLAN, a virtual LAN,\nis really a broadcast domain,\n\n16\n00:00:53.897 --> 00:00:57.703\nwhich means it's a subnet or\na link if we were using IPv6.\n\n17\n00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:04.146\nEither way, for every router interface,\nright, we're going to have a subnet, okay?\n\n18\n00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:07.700\nSo even though we have VLANs, and they're\nvirtual, we still need a router interface,\n\n19\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.740\nwe'll see that.\n\n20\n00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.580\nNow, in this case here,\nwe have this core switch down here.\n\n21\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.945\nBefore we had this we had a router,\nand we had hubs,\n\n22\n00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:18.478\nwhere we had a broadcast domain and\ncollision domain in each floor, right?\n\n23\n00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.499\nAnd then so whoever sat in, if you\nwere in sales on the first floor, and\n\n24\n00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.979\nyou had to be on sales, well if they ran\nout of room, then they'd have to go up to,\n\n25\n00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.003\nI don't know they could sit on\nthe second floor where accounting is but\n\n26\n00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.061\nthey'd be in the accounting collision\ndomain and broadcast domain.\n\n27\n00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:34.649\nWe had that problem for a really long\ntime, until mid 90s when they came out\n\n28\n00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.864\nwith switches, more likely late\n90s when they were affordable.\n\n29\n00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:41.998\nBut I remember, hey do you remember\nthe switches in '95 where I was buying\n\n30\n00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:46.420\nCatalyst 5000 from Cisco, and\nit was a 12-port 10 100 card.\n\n31\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.487\nGuess how much it was?\n\n32\n00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:48.543\n>> I don't even have a clue.\n\n33\n00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:49.846\n>> Okay, $12,000.\n\n34\n00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:50.587\n>> $12,000.\n\n35\n00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:53.861\n>> [LAUGH] I can get a better switch for\n$49 at Best Buy now,\n\n36\n00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:54.499\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.634\n>> Then that, but that was in 1995,\n\n38\n00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:57.843\n12 grand for that.\n\n39\n00:01:57.843 --> 00:01:59.445\n>> Wow.\n>> Anyways, I know.\n\n40\n00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.707\nAnyways, that's how their stock went up so\nhigh, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:03.404\n>> A little mark up.\n\n42\n00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:04.727\n>> Selling switchboards at $1,000 a port.\n\n43\n00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:06.585\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, third floor.\n\n44\n00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:10.458\nSo in this case here, what switches\nallowed us to do is break the physical\n\n45\n00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:13.440\nboundary, and\nnow that doesn't matter where you are,\n\n46\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.140\nit matters your switch port and\nyour port membership on your switch.\n\n47\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.620\nSo you say, wherever Bob plugs into you\nand says, you're in the sales VLAN,\n\n48\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.890\nyou're in the sales subnet.\n\n49\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.620\nSo remember, VLAN equals subnet\nequals broadcast domain.\n\n50\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.980\nBroadcast domain equals\nsubnet equals VLAN.\n\n51\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.070\nAll those terms are interchangeable,\nthey all mean the same thing, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.220\nSo notice here, so it doesn't matter\nwhere you sit, your membership.\n\n53\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.800\nSo we fixed that problem where we\nhad the physical boundaries before.\n\n54\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.530\nThat was quite a problem.\n\n55\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.380\nSo before VLANs we had no\nseparation between hosts.\n\n56\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.020\nWe are plugging into a hub or\neven some type of switch that didn't have,\n\n57\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.240\na multiport bridge that did\nnot have VLAN capability.\n\n58\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.457\nSo we have separate collision domains,\n\n59\n00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:54.830\nthis will give us micro-segmentation,\nthis is great.\n\n60\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.550\nBut we couldn't put them\nin separate subnets,\n\n61\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.330\nit was still one broadcast domain.\n\n62\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.270\nWhich, you would think about maybe\nthere wouldn't be a problem, but\n\n63\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.870\nwe had hundreds of hosts in\nbroadcast in the mid to late 90s.\n\n64\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.360\nThere was hundreds and hundreds of hosts.\n\n65\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.810\nPeople didn't understand subnetting and\n\n66\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.350\nall this, and so everyone just ended\nup in the same broadcast domain.\n\n67\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.710\nThat became the problem.\n\n68\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.617\nAll right, now, when we came to\nswitch by creating VLANs and\n\n69\n00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:18.570\nseparating them out by department,\nit's like having separate switches.\n\n70\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.270\nBut it's done logically, so\nthis is still physically one switch, but\n\n71\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.490\nit looks like separate switches,\nthey are called bridge groups.\n\n72\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.370\nReally, a VLAN is a bridge group.\n\n73\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.540\nBridge groups became virtual LANs.\n\n74\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.520\nAll right, so switches to one switch,\nbut they're logically separate.\n\n75\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.690\nVLANs increase broadcast domains\nin switched networks, so\n\n76\n00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.090\nnow a virtual LAN is breaking up\na broadcast domains in a layer two\n\n77\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.900\nswitched network,\nthat is our definition there.\n\n78\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.340\nBreaking up a broadcast domains\nin a layer two switched network.\n\n79\n00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.568\nI no longer need a physical router port to\nbreak up broadcast domains in my switched\n\n80\n00:03:51.568 --> 00:03:52.720\nnetwork.\n\n81\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.980\nVLANs allow access to network\nservices based on department,\n\n82\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.060\nnot physical locations and they make it\neasy to move, because if Bob moves, I just\n\n83\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.662\nchange the port membership, and he still\nhas all the same rights to everything.\n\n84\n00:04:02.662 --> 00:04:03.700\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n85\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.220\nNow, to be able to\ncommunicate between VLANs,\n\n86\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.200\nI need some sort of layer 3 device here,\nno if, ands, or buts.\n\n87\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.950\nNow I wrote this in here cuz Cisco\nlikes to use the term address space.\n\n88\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.080\nKinda makes sense when you start\nthinking about subnets and\n\n89\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.550\nthen we have links with IPv6, and they're\nboth just separate address spaces, right?\n\n90\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.490\nSo we want to think about\nseparate address space,\n\n91\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.180\nI just want you to get\nused to that terminology.\n\n92\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.150\nA switch maintains a separate\nbridging table for each VLAN.\n\n93\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.670\nLet's take a look.\n\n94\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.430\nRemember these are bridge groups, really.\n\n95\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.810\nOkay, let's take a look here.\n\n96\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.030\nSo, notice here I have\nmy VLANs listed here.\n\n97\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.280\nNow depending on the IOS\nversion of your switch,\n\n98\n00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.570\nyou're gonna have the VLANs listed here.\n\n99\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.310\nNow, the VLANs might be listed over\nhere instead of over here to the left.\n\n100\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.434\nIt doesn't matter, they will be listed.\n\n101\n00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:52.683\nSo notice these ports are in VLAN 1,\nI don't have room in here, VLAN 2, VLAN 3.\n\n102\n00:04:52.683 --> 00:04:57.532\nAnd what I'm trying to say here though,\nis that if a port comes in, remember,\n\n103\n00:04:57.532 --> 00:05:01.354\nif a MAC address comes in with\na destination that's unknown,\n\n104\n00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:05.929\nit's gonna flood out all other ports\nexcept the one it was originated on.\n\n105\n00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:10.550\nBut remember, now we're gonna add to that\nsentence, all ports in the same VLAN.\n\n106\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.940\nNot all ports on the switch now.\n\n107\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.360\nSince we have VLANs, it's gonna be flooded\nout all ports in the same VLAN except for\n\n108\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.670\nthe one it was on.\n\n109\n00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.681\nSo if someone says hey, you have this Mac\naddress coming in with this destination,\n\n110\n00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:24.573\nyou need to go look for the source, find\nit, find out what VLAN it's in, look for\n\n111\n00:05:24.573 --> 00:05:25.524\nthe destination.\n\n112\n00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:29.528\nIf you don't see it, then it's gonna be\nflooded out all ports in the same VLAN, so\n\n113\n00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:33.357\nI just go mark all the ports that are VLAN\n3 in this example, it comes in here and\n\n114\n00:05:33.357 --> 00:05:35.357\nonly goes out 6 in this example, okay?\n\n115\n00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:41.370\nSo broadcast and multicast packets\nonly go out ports in the same VLAN.\n\n116\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.640\nNow, here we're gonna define\naccess link and trunk links.\n\n117\n00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.080\nAccess links carry\ninformation about one VLAN.\n\n118\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.180\nWe're gonna use a straight\nthrough cable aren't we guys?\n\n119\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.930\nAnd then in trunk links, we're gonna have,\nthis is what we're gonna use between\n\n120\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.170\nswitches to send information\nabout multiple VLANs.\n\n121\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.910\nBy default it sends all VLAN information,\nbut we can prune that.\n\n122\n00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.630\nBut trunk links carry information\nabout all or many VLANs, and\n\n123\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.150\nremember we're gonna use\na crossover cable between switches.\n\n124\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.960\nI know that's redundant and\nI bring it up a lot.\n\n125\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.342\nI don't want to see you\nguys miss the easy ones,\n\n126\n00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:09.864\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:11.048\n>> Right?\n\n128\n00:06:11.048 --> 00:06:16.520\nSo, if I had some switches here, each of\nthem have two hosts, one in each VLAN.\n\n129\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.340\nI can just create access ports on the\nswitch and connect the switches together,\n\n130\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.852\nand use an access port,\nconnecting my switches,\n\n131\n00:06:23.852 --> 00:06:25.610\npassing information about each VLAN.\n\n132\n00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.830\nThis is unlikely you're gonna do this\ntoday because switch ports cost money,\n\n133\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.590\nalthough they're a lot cheaper than\nin 1995, they still cost money.\n\n134\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.320\nAnd port density, I'm telling you,\n\n135\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.430\nno matter what customer I go to,\nthere are no open switchboards.\n\n136\n00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.760\nIf there's an open switchboard,\n\n137\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.440\nwe will find something to put in there,\nI promise you.\n\n138\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.241\n[LAUGH] So we're not gonna do this,\nwe're gonna do something like this, right?\n\n139\n00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:49.280\nWe're gonna have a single cable,\ntypically running gigabit.\n\n140\n00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.732\nAnd what we're gonna\nlearn about next week,\n\n141\n00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:55.797\nis that we're gonna put multiple cables\nin here so we have redundancy, but\n\n142\n00:06:55.797 --> 00:06:59.624\nwe're gonna bundle those together and\nget more throughput, right?\n\n143\n00:06:59.624 --> 00:07:00.878\nSo we're gonna learn about that.\n\n144\n00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:02.878\nBut nonetheless,\nthese are access ports and\n\n145\n00:07:02.878 --> 00:07:05.882\nnow they're gonna go over to trunk\nport and be able to communicate.\n\n146\n00:07:05.882 --> 00:07:11.790\nBut can this host here, in the sales VLAN,\ncan talk to this host, we know that.\n\n147\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.280\nBut how does it talk to this admin host?\n\n148\n00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.480\nWell in this picture here guys, it can't.\n\n149\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.930\nThere is no router in here and\n\n150\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.090\nit doesn't say anything about\na layer 3 switch in this capability.\n\n151\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.810\nSo in this case,\nwe can't talk between VLANs.\n\n152\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.550\nWe can talk to any other host in\nthe same VLAN on different switches,\n\n153\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.010\ncuz we have that trunk link now.\n\n154\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150\nNow that's something that\nwe run across trunk link.\n\n155\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.480\nWe do some sort of encapsulation\ncalled frame tagging, frame tagging.\n\n156\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.270\nWe'll take a look at the actual frame.\n\n157\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.690\nBut in frame tagging,\nwhat that says is, hey,\n\n158\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.473\nthis guy's coming in from the blue VLAN or\nwhatever and\n\n159\n00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:49.650\nhe's gonna go out to this trunk port,\nbecause everything goes out to trunk port,\n\n160\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.850\nright, because on the other side we pass\ninformation about all VLANs by default.\n\n161\n00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.570\nSo if that's part of one of those VLANs\nand not then it's gonna go across there.\n\n162\n00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.181\nWell if a frame comes across\nhere How does this switch,\n\n163\n00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:05.190\nwhen it receives it,\nknow which VLAN it's a member of?\n\n164\n00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.010\nThe answer is,\nwe tag it when it leaves here.\n\n165\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.650\nSo when it leaves here we put\ntagging information on there.\n\n166\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.923\nAnd we say you're a member, we're gonna\ntag it, you're a member of the whatever.\n\n167\n00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:20.663\nNow let's start to look at some bullet\npoints here that are important for\n\n168\n00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:21.915\nyour objectives.\n\n169\n00:08:21.915 --> 00:08:26.471\n802.1q, so we actually use two types,\nbefore I get started.\n\n170\n00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:30.422\nISL is the Cisco proprietary, and\nthis is the IEEE version called,\n\n171\n00:08:30.422 --> 00:08:33.973\nthese are both frame tagging methods,\nthey both work fine.\n\n172\n00:08:33.973 --> 00:08:40.310\nISL has to tag the native VLAN,\n802.1q does not.\n\n173\n00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.610\nCisco's actually going away from the ISL.\n\n174\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.375\nWhy?\nCuz they sat on the board and\n\n175\n00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:47.172\ngot everything they wanted in 802.1q.\n\n176\n00:08:47.172 --> 00:08:48.137\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n177\n00:08:48.137 --> 00:08:50.684\nthe CCNA doesn't even talk about the ISL,\nit's only 802.1q only.\n\n178\n00:08:50.684 --> 00:08:56.724\nAs a matter of fact,\nthe switches I have here only run 802.1q.\n\n179\n00:08:56.724 --> 00:09:00.460\n802.1q native VLANs now hold on,\nlet's find a native VLAN.\n\n180\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.548\nThis is where I'm gonna send\ntraffic down that's not tagged.\n\n181\n00:09:05.548 --> 00:09:08.868\nWell it's VLAN 1 by default,\nbut we can easily change that.\n\n182\n00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:13.280\nThat's my native VLAN, meaning that\nI'm not going to send tag traffic.\n\n183\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.380\nSo when it comes across this link, so\n\n184\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.010\nwhen it comes across here and\nthis guy gets it and it's not tagged.\n\n185\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.880\nFirst off, you can't do it with ISL,\nit has to be 802.1q and it's not tagged.\n\n186\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.559\nIt's gonna go ahead, and we're gonna get\nmore in to depth on this on what happens\n\n187\n00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:28.573\nwhen they don't have the same native VLAN.\n\n188\n00:09:28.573 --> 00:09:32.265\nBut the point is if it's not tagged it\nsays you're part of the management VLAN,\n\n189\n00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.330\nVLAN 1 or 99 whatever it is, here you go.\n\n190\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.610\nAnd you can only go out to those ports,\nif any.\n\n191\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.460\nA lot of times I don't have\nany ports in that native VLAN.\n\n192\n00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.460\nIt's just the logical ports\nare in that native VLAN,\n\n193\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.230\nbecause we're trying to send\nNate management traffic.\n\n194\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.390\nAnd I don't really always change it,\nbut a lot of people do because\n\n195\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.650\neveryone knows that your management\ntraffic going down VLAN 1 by default.\n\n196\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.742\nSo that's why you would change it and\n\n197\n00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:57.383\nwe'll show you how to do\nthat here in a second.\n\n198\n00:09:57.383 --> 00:10:00.873\nSo let's take a look at this frame,\nso here's a regular frame here.\n\n199\n00:10:00.873 --> 00:10:02.580\nWe have our source and destination.\n\n200\n00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.990\nHere's my ether type field and\nthen here's my packet.\n\n201\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:12.310\nNow, what we're gonna do is\nright here before, right here,\n\n202\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.810\nwe're going to insert before the packet,\nthe 802.1 field here.\n\n203\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.140\nSo here's my source MAC address,\nmy length field, my tag.\n\n204\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.170\nSo here's my 802.1q field and\nso the thing is,\n\n205\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.291\nis that ISL actually puts it as a header.\n\n206\n00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:31.382\nSo it doesn't have to re-calculate\nthe frame, but in this case here,\n\n207\n00:10:31.382 --> 00:10:36.650\n802.1q inserts it into the middle\n16 bits here, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\n\n208\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.290\nSo actually 16 bits, if we calculate that,\n\n209\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.368\nthat allows us to send 4,094 VLANs,\nthat's why it's 16 bits.\n\n210\n00:10:43.368 --> 00:10:47.715\nBecause that's how many we can create on\na Cisco if we use the extended VLAN range,\n\n211\n00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:49.470\nwhich we'll talk about.\n\n212\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.610\nNow nonetheless, here's the thing you\nneed to remember for the objectives.\n\n213\n00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.402\nIf I'm using 802.1Q,\nit inserts it in the middle of this,\n\n214\n00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:58.209\nand so we have to recalculate the CRC,\nonce we add 802.1q.\n\n215\n00:10:58.209 --> 00:11:03.300\nNow it can be read on the other side,\nand we know which VLAN it's a member of.\n\n216\n00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.738\nLet's get to the easy part-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:11:05.738 --> 00:11:07.015\n>> Because this is the easy part.\n\n218\n00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:07.860\nHow do I create a VLAN?\n\n219\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.052\nConfig t vlan 2.\n\n220\n00:11:09.052 --> 00:11:10.819\n>> That's it.\n\n221\n00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:11.610\n>> I'm done.\n\n222\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.030\nNow I recommend naming it.\n\n223\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.410\nIn this case here, I named it Sales.\n\n224\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.240\nSo vlan 2, name Sales.\n\n225\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.330\nNotice I have another one 3,\nand I named it Voice.\n\n226\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.653\nI'm gonna show you that,\nthat's part of the objectives now guys,\n\n227\n00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:21.404\nit was not until now.\n\n228\n00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:24.331\nAnd I'm kinda surprised it took\nthem this long to put this in here,\n\n229\n00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.760\nbut notice I created two vlans.\n\n230\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.721\nOne sales vlan and one voice vlan, vlan 2\nand 3 respectively name vlan 2, vlan 3.\n\n231\n00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.940\nI'll just go in and do this.\n\n232\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.690\nNow when we get to next week I'm\ngonna talk about I create this\n\n233\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.660\nhuge vlan database,\nhundreds of vlans on this switch.\n\n234\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.700\nI have to go to every\nswitch in my network.\n\n235\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.200\nThere's probably a preferred\nbest way to do it,\n\n236\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.510\nbut then we could have a problem with\nnaming, might screw something up.\n\n237\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.509\nWe're gonna learn on something on\nhow to transmit that database and\n\n238\n00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:49.885\nsend it to the other switches.\n\n239\n00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:55.400\nAnd they're gonna receive it and use that\ndatabase, so you only have to do it once.\n\n240\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.375\n[COUGH] Now to add a vlan into\na switchboard because remember,\n\n241\n00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:00.018\neverything's vlan by default.\n\n242\n00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:02.839\nSo we need to change it from its default,\nwe're going to come in here and\n\n243\n00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:06.130\nsay switchport access,\nwe're an access port and then the vlan.\n\n244\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.398\nSwitchport access vlan 2, check this out.\n\n245\n00:12:09.398 --> 00:12:11.893\nI'm in the F01 so\ncheck out, I'm now in F02.\n\n246\n00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:18.561\nSwitchport access vlan 2, my data vlan,\nI'm part of the sales vlan.\n\n247\n00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:22.060\nBut notice this, so\nI go into my old book and everything.\n\n248\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.302\nIt's pretty funny because I'm like,\nyou can only add one VLAN per port, and\n\n249\n00:12:26.302 --> 00:12:28.469\nI'm like and yeah, da, da, da, da.\n\n250\n00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:30.460\nAnd I'm like telling you like ten times,\nand I go well except for this.\n\n251\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.268\nBecause now I can add another\nVLAN on the same port but\n\n252\n00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:37.529\nit has to be a different type of VLAN.\n\n253\n00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:38.434\nSo we can have one data field,\n\n254\n00:12:38.434 --> 00:12:40.827\nand they probably should have named this\ndata instead of access knowing if they\n\n255\n00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:42.580\nwould have known, but\nremember that was a long time ago.\n\n256\n00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:46.500\nSwitchport data, vlan 2 if you want\nto think about it like that, and\n\n257\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.530\nnow I can do voice.\n\n258\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.140\nNow why?\n\n259\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.350\nBecause obviously I have my PC,\n\n260\n00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.230\nlaptop whatever plugs into the phone,\nphone plugs into the jack.\n\n261\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.700\nAnd now I've got data and voice going\nacross the same port, into the same port.\n\n262\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.920\nWell as soon as it hits the port though\nbased on it's tag, I can separate it.\n\n263\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.979\nVoice goes over here to QoS,\ndata goes over here to whatever.\n\n264\n00:13:04.979 --> 00:13:08.283\nSo now we can separate the traffic and\ngive it a class of service, and so\n\n265\n00:13:08.283 --> 00:13:09.660\non like that.\n\n266\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.681\nVery cool technology,\nthat's a CCN objective.\n\n267\n00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:14.558\nReally nothing hard there at all.\n\n268\n00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:15.615\nShow vlan here and\n\n269\n00:13:15.615 --> 00:13:20.380\nthat if we're doing port security\nremember don't forget your maximum.\n\n270\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.479\nTry it with two might have to go to three.\n\n271\n00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:26.872\nShow VLAN, now what you guys wanna\nremember here on Nexus the show VLAN is\n\n272\n00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.541\nkind of annoying on Nexus.\n\n273\n00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.480\nI love Nexus, nothing annoys me on\nthat except for that one command,\n\n274\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.420\ncuz it puts all my trunk\nports in here as well.\n\n275\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.820\nThis one does not, so\nthe show vlan in the IOS displays\n\n276\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.730\naccess ports, displays access ports\nnot trunk ports only access ports.\n\n277\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.190\nSo if it's in here, they come back to\nthat in a second when I just said.\n\n278\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.370\nNotice here's my default, I cannot rename,\ndelete, or anything with this.\n\n279\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.755\nYou're stuck with it but\nwait, there's more.\n\n280\n00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:59.099\nSo also 1002, I almost had to think for\n\n281\n00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:04.420\na second, 1002 to 1005 are also reserved.\n\n282\n00:14:07.032 --> 00:14:11.470\n1002 to 1005 are also reserved,\nthat means you can create how many VLANs?\n\n283\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.181\nWell from 2 to 1001, which is 1000 vlans.\n\n284\n00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:17.480\nIs that enough for you?\n\n285\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.412\nI would hope so.\n\n286\n00:14:18.412 --> 00:14:21.300\n[LAUGH] 2to 1001, but wait!\n\n287\n00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.480\nWhat happens if I need 1002 vlans or\nI wanna use a different number range,\n\n288\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.330\nI wanna type in 2000 cuz it sounds fun and\nit's good?\n\n289\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.034\nWell I can do that,\nit's called the extended vlan range.\n\n290\n00:14:31.034 --> 00:14:35.661\nYou have to be in VTP transparent mode to\ndo that, but I think in the new 15 code,\n\n291\n00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:38.200\nI was able to type it in\nwhen it was in server.\n\n292\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.142\nSo before that, you have to be in a\ncertain mode, which we'll talk about later\n\n293\n00:14:42.142 --> 00:14:46.347\nit's not even important to be able to get\ninto something called extend VLAN range.\n\n294\n00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:48.522\nBut I tried it the other day and\nactually when we go and do our lab,\n\n295\n00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:49.325\nremind me to try that.\n\n296\n00:14:49.325 --> 00:14:49.891\n>> Okay.\n\n297\n00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:52.973\n>> And so we'll see if we can\nget into the extended VLAN\n\n298\n00:14:52.973 --> 00:14:55.923\ntrades without configuring\nthe switch to do so.\n\n299\n00:14:55.923 --> 00:14:57.800\nDo me a favor guys, riddle me this.\n\n300\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.819\nHow many broadcast domains\ndo you see on the screen?\n\n301\n00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:01.319\nWhat do you think?\n\n302\n00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.421\nOne big one?\n\n303\n00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:09.218\nRemember, a VLAN equals what?\n\n304\n00:15:09.218 --> 00:15:11.470\n>> A broadcast domain,\n>> A broadcast domain, a subnet,\n\n305\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.433\nsubnet equals a broadcast\ndomain equals a vlan.\n\n306\n00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:14.580\nSo how VLANs do I see?\n\n307\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.879\nCuz that's the same thing as-\n>> Five?\n\n308\n00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:18.800\n>> So now I have five broadcast\ndomains shown on this screen.\n\n309\n00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.520\nEvery VLAN is a broadcaster name.\n\n310\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.650\nWhat are you on question down to 36 now?\n\n311\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.430\n>> Probably.\n>> Yeah, that was a good question, and\n\n312\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.666\nhe's gotten all those right too.\n\n313\n00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:27.387\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n314\n00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:29.097\nhe's on his way to\na perfect score in this.\n\n315\n00:15:29.097 --> 00:15:32.290\nI know you can subnet well now,\nI think you can.\n\n316\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.763\n>> Maybe.\n[LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:15:33.763 --> 00:15:34.318\n>> We'll have to test them\n\n318\n00:15:34.318 --> 00:15:34.990\nhere again in a minute.\n\n319\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.970\n>> I think can only do it with\ntequila though, apparently.\n\n320\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:37.993\n>> With what?\n>> With tequila.\n\n321\n00:15:37.993 --> 00:15:38.699\n>> With tequila.\n\n322\n00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:40.953\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, I'm joking.\n\n323\n00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:42.459\n>> [LAUGH] He's joking.\n\n324\n00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:43.448\nI'm gonna bring that in tomorrow and\nif he misses the subnet question.\n\n325\n00:15:43.448 --> 00:15:45.886\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n326\n00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:48.228\nwe can see here's my sales.\n\n327\n00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:51.453\nNotice, you guys don't\nsee something like this,\n\n328\n00:15:51.453 --> 00:15:54.309\nnotice I see port two\nin two different VLANs.\n\n329\n00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:58.122\nThat's not possible, I can't do this\nunless they're different types of VLANs.\n\n330\n00:15:58.122 --> 00:16:00.744\nAll right, so we created a voice VLAN and\na data VLAN and\n\n331\n00:16:00.744 --> 00:16:02.820\nnow that port's in both, right?\n\n332\n00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.050\nSo, notice [COUGH] now,\nthis is a 12 port switch.\n\n333\n00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.990\nWhere's ports 11 and 12?\n\n334\n00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.400\nWell, even if they were shut down,\n\n335\n00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.490\nthey'd still show up in here cuz\nthey'd be members of it by default.\n\n336\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.190\nSo what do you think?\n\n337\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.690\nWhere are they?\n\n338\n00:16:17.738 --> 00:16:19.550\nWhat is this displaying?\n\n339\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.440\n>> Only access ports, so they're trunks.\n\n340\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.510\n>> See, he knows his foundation.\n\n341\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.400\nThat's how we can get the question right,\nright?\n\n342\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.950\nIt's usually like, they're trunk ports,\nthis only displays access ports, so\n\n343\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.610\nit must be trunked, and he's right.\n\n344\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.250\nThey would show in here if they\nwere shut down or disabled.\n\n345\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:38.620\nAll right, so\nin this case here I have a 12 switch port.\n\n346\n00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.170\nNow, one of the things I want\nyou guys to be careful of\n\n347\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.450\nis let's say you see a switch output,\n\n348\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.705\nokay pay attention, objectives here,\nif the out You have a switch output.\n\n349\n00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:50.505\nIt says, why are you passing information\nfrom host A, but not host B?\n\n350\n00:16:50.505 --> 00:16:54.355\nAnd you can see that host A is in\nVLAN 10 and post B is in VLAN 20.\n\n351\n00:16:54.355 --> 00:16:58.455\nAnd it’s saying you’re only\npassing information from VLAN 10.\n\n352\n00:16:58.455 --> 00:16:59.035\nWhat’s the problem?\n\n353\n00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:04.555\nIf you do an output of the show VLAN, you\nsee the port connecting those two switches\n\n354\n00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:07.885\ntogether in this output and because\nyou have a strong foundation you go,\n\n355\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.350\nthat's an access board, so I'm going\nto pass information about one VLAN and\n\n356\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.470\nwe'll see down here that it\nwas listed here in VLAN 10.\n\n357\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.770\nRight past the information VLAN 10 so if\nits in here, it's not a trunk port, right?\n\n358\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.330\nThat's your big trouble shooting port.\n\n359\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.090\nOkay, show in switch\nport is a good command.\n\n360\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.530\nI don't use this in production.\n\n361\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.100\nI just really don't need it but\nin the objectives, they use this.\n\n362\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.250\nShow int in switchport where\nthe separate int is a variable.\n\n363\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.880\nWe can see that as dynamic desirable.\n\n364\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.470\nThat's a default trunk mode.\n\n365\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.810\nWe'll get to that in a second.\n\n366\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.540\nAnd then that we can see that but\n\n367\n00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.790\nit's running static access because\nI just configured it here.\n\n368\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.160\nI went back a couple pages and\nconfigured this port into a VLAN.\n\n369\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.030\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n370\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.150\nSo, negotiation trunking is on.\n\n371\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.630\nNow, this is gonna run what we'll talk\nabout here in a second, DTP,and so\n\n372\n00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.560\nwe can look at this and\nwe'll see if we had in this port,\n\n373\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.500\nin a voice VLAN we'd see our VLAN here, up\nhere, access mode VLAN and our number and\n\n374\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.470\nthen we'd see another one down here in\nour access mode if we had a voice VLAN.\n\n375\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.140\nTo trunk typically for\nmost switches today,\n\n376\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.620\nyou're just gonna go to the interface and\nturn it on.\n\n377\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.070\nAnd Cisco recommends turning it on.\n\n378\n00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.670\nRemember, they're dynamic desirable.\n\n379\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.460\nLet's talk about these right now.\n\n380\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.280\nOkay?\nThe possible trunk modes are auto,\n\n381\n00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.570\nI typically don't use that,\non, and desirable.\n\n382\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.640\nNow, the default is dynamic desirable.\n\n383\n00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.500\nDynamic desirable.\n\n384\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.460\nWhat that means is I'm going to\nrun something as I just mentioned,\n\n385\n00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.350\ndynamic trunk protocol.\n\n386\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:43.830\nSo what happens if a switch comes up and\nit has cable, gets carried to tech\n\n387\n00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.740\nit sends out dynamic trunk protocol to see\nif there's another Cisco switch connected.\n\n388\n00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.580\nIf there is, it's gonna say,\nhey do you run 802.1q?\n\n389\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.969\nCause I run 802.1q and if you do,\nI desire to trunk with you baby.\n\n390\n00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.813\nSo this guy's [LAUGH], and\nthey're just going to come up and trunk.\n\n391\n00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:02.572\nSo as a matter of fact, when I did these\nslides, I just connected two switches\n\n392\n00:19:02.572 --> 00:19:05.458\ntogether with some crossover cables,\nI really didn't, but I gotta say that for\n\n393\n00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:08.344\nthe CCNA, with two crossover cables and\nall the sudden, they didn't show up and\n\n394\n00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:09.976\nshow reline anymore when\nI got to the slides.\n\n395\n00:19:09.976 --> 00:19:14.963\nAnd because the DTP came up and\nit negotiated 802.1q, and\n\n396\n00:19:14.963 --> 00:19:17.796\nlooked at the native vlan, right?\n\n397\n00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:20.570\nAnd made sure they were both\nthe same vlan, and then trunked.\n\n398\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.050\nAll right, so\nswitchport mode trunk to turn it on.\n\n399\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.450\nNow, nonetheless I should come back\nin there and turn my trunk ports and\n\n400\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.910\nmake them on, turn them on,\ndon't let them autonegotiate.\n\n401\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.648\nYou're gonna trunk, trunk.\n\n402\n00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:30.243\nTurn it on.\n\n403\n00:19:30.243 --> 00:19:33.750\nOkay now,\nif I have a switch that runs 802.\n\n404\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.290\n1q and isl,\nwhen I go into switchport mode trunk and\n\n405\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.990\npress Enter, it's gonna come back and\nsay must set encapsulation first.\n\n406\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.840\nSo, I'm gonna come back under here and\nsay, switchport trunk encapsulation,\n\n407\n00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.550\nin this case dot1q, notice it can run isl,\nthat's why it asks me.\n\n408\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.990\nDot [LAUGH] it's kind of cute isn't it,\n802 dot1q it's a,\n\n409\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.510\nthat's my trunking method.\n\n410\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.810\nThen I turn on the trunk, now I can change\nthe native VLAN and check this out so\n\n411\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.800\nI say switch port trunk, native VLAN 99.\n\n412\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:07.000\nSo I'm changing it from 1 to 99 here, but\nI didn't change it on the other side,\n\n413\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.313\nI only changed it on this side,\nwhat's going to happen?\n\n414\n00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:10.772\n>> it's gonna fail.\n\n415\n00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:12.103\n>> [SOUND]\n>> The trunking?\n\n416\n00:20:12.103 --> 00:20:16.315\n>> Well let's say, I have two switches\nhere, and I have a switch here, and\n\n417\n00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.840\nI have ports 11 and 12 as we know.\n\n418\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.430\nNow, this guy's a native VLAN 99 and\nthis guy's at one.\n\n419\n00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.210\nSo that means, when I send untagged\ntraffic across his trunk link,\n\n420\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.360\nhe's gonna be a member of vlan 99.\n\n421\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.270\nBut you know what,\nthis guy doesn't know that, it's untagged.\n\n422\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.550\nSo he comes back and goes, it´s on tape so\nthat means you are a member of VLAN one.\n\n423\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.580\nAnd it puts it and\nit gives it to VLAN one.\n\n424\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.810\nSo it does work, however he is kind\nof right because what happens on your\n\n425\n00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.080\nconsole, you will fix this and\nI will tell you why.\n\n426\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.590\nBecause [LAUGH] every 60 seconds,\nCDP is going to tell you,\n\n427\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.130\nnative VLAN mismatch, native VLAN\nmismatch, native VLAN mismatch, and\n\n428\n00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.890\nit happens when CDP does this for\nus, right.\n\n429\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.140\nSo, we're gonna get [LAUGH]\nthat error on our console.\n\n430\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.700\nEventually you're gonna go I got to\nfix this, this is driving me insane.\n\n431\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.620\nAnyways, so what will happen, you'll see\nsomething like this on the job it'll say\n\n432\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.220\nyou're sending this out\nfrom VLAN 5 right and\n\n433\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.640\nthen you can see that switch\nport trunk native VLAN 5 right.\n\n434\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.540\nSo you can look at the CONFIG and\nsee that.\n\n435\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.060\nAnd then that comes across and goes, but\n\n436\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.110\nwhen it comes it ends up on VLAN two,\nhow come?\n\n437\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.310\nWell, because they have different\nnative VLAN's, it's going to work,\n\n438\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.250\nbut it will give you an error but in the\nmeantime it'll still keep working, because\n\n439\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.610\nit doesn't know that it came from five,\nit just knows it's untagged, all right?\n\n440\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.080\nSo, the native VLAN does work.\n\n441\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.650\nWe can use the auto trunk mode on one\nside, we come back and turn it on,\n\n442\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.960\nthe minute we do that then the trunk\nwould come up I typically don't do that.\n\n443\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.510\nI either let it run dynamic desirable or\n\n444\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.080\nI literally tell my customers I\nwill turn on trunking, right?\n\n445\n00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.490\nYou want these trunk,\nif you're gonna trunk, trunk.\n\n446\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.190\nAll right, to display trunk,\nto verify trunk,\n\n447\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.370\nit's show int trunk and\nthis is the best command.\n\n448\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.090\nThere is another command we'll\nlook at here in a second.\n\n449\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.470\nThat I use I have a customary\n384 trunk ports on the switch.\n\n450\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.454\nThat's a lot of trunk ports, my friend.\n\n451\n00:21:57.454 --> 00:21:58.309\n>> That's a lot of trunk ports.\n\n452\n00:21:58.309 --> 00:22:01.225\n>> And so I keep, if I did show in\ntrunk and I'm looking for, I mean,\n\n453\n00:22:01.225 --> 00:22:03.100\nthat's gonna take a while to see it.\n\n454\n00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.356\nBut let's go through this and\nI'll show you the command.\n\n455\n00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:07.168\nShow in trunk port F0/11, port F0/12,\n\n456\n00:22:07.168 --> 00:22:10.606\nthese are my ports that were\nmissing off my pro ports fetch.\n\n457\n00:22:10.606 --> 00:22:11.241\nWhy?\n\n458\n00:22:11.241 --> 00:22:14.150\nBecause they were desirable,\nthey desired the trunk.\n\n459\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:19.070\nThey both were an 802.1q [COUGH] your\nnative VLAN is, is 1, the other side,\n\n460\n00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.290\nif it's 99, this is going to tell me\nif I look at both of them that I have\n\n461\n00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.490\na native VLAN mismatch, I'm telling you\nyou don't have to do this to know it,\n\n462\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.590\nit will tell you with CDP.\n\n463\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.740\nOkay then as trunking all the VLANs\nare allowed by default aren't they?\n\n464\n00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.320\nAll of them.\nSo we can fix that.\n\n465\n00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.500\nNow, if I had, so one of my customers, if\nI had all those hundreds of trunk boards.\n\n466\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.320\nIt's really difficult for\n\n467\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.050\nme to get specific information\nwhen I have something like that.\n\n468\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.440\nSo I'm gonna use a show int int trunk\nwhere the second one int information.\n\n469\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.190\nIt's the same thing.\n\n470\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.710\nIt just lets me drill in there.\n\n471\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.030\nSo show int int trunk.\n\n472\n00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.930\nNow, in this case here, I'm gonna do\nthe show int int switch port again.\n\n473\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.250\nI don't use this in production, but\nfor the objectives you're going to.\n\n474\n00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.160\nDynamic desirable mode trunk, right?\n\n475\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.170\nSo we can see that it's mode.\n\n476\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.590\nBecause dynamic desirable mode\nwas static access wasn't it?\n\n477\n00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.480\nLet's talk about inter VLAN routing.\n\n478\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.380\nSo now, that I created my VLANs,\nnow I want to talk between them.\n\n479\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.183\nNow, on the CCNA if I\nsee something like this,\n\n480\n00:23:14.183 --> 00:23:15.951\nthat means I'm using\na router which I can do.\n\n481\n00:23:15.951 --> 00:23:19.939\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ndo that now, we're going to go ahead and\n\n482\n00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:22.655\ntrunk this, so\nwhat we do is we trunk this port.\n\n483\n00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:24.825\nYou can't trunk a router port,\nplease be clear on that.\n\n484\n00:23:24.825 --> 00:23:28.887\nYou can't trunk a router port, but you\ntrunk a switch port, so you trunk this so\n\n485\n00:23:28.887 --> 00:23:33.135\nyou send out all information, and then\nwe're going to create some interfaces here\n\n486\n00:23:33.135 --> 00:23:35.278\nlogical interfaces, one for each VLAN.\n\n487\n00:23:35.278 --> 00:23:38.475\nIt's really pretty simple, and\nthen it all of a sudden starts working.\n\n488\n00:23:38.475 --> 00:23:42.076\nThe problem with this, though, if you have\na lot of hosts, remember for this guy,\n\n489\n00:23:42.076 --> 00:23:45.420\ngreen VLAN, to talk to this black VLAN,\nit's got to go all the way over here,\n\n490\n00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.056\ngo to the router, come back for\nevery single frame, right?\n\n491\n00:23:48.056 --> 00:23:52.928\nSo, yeah, it looks like,\nyou can see kind of the bottleneck.\n\n492\n00:23:52.928 --> 00:23:57.606\nThis works well in very small networks\nlike if I use it at home for testing or\n\n493\n00:23:57.606 --> 00:23:58.441\nsomething.\n\n494\n00:23:58.441 --> 00:24:00.553\nWhen I'm writing a book it works great for\nsomething like that.\n\n495\n00:24:00.553 --> 00:24:02.223\nI don't know how much I'd use this for\nproduction.\n\n496\n00:24:02.223 --> 00:24:03.869\nBut People do do it, why?\n\n497\n00:24:03.869 --> 00:24:06.598\nBecause it's free if you have a router,\nright?\n\n498\n00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:08.422\nIt doesn't cost anything.\n\n499\n00:24:08.422 --> 00:24:11.670\nAll right, so only hosts in the same\nVLANs can communicate by default.\n\n500\n00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.450\nBut if I do this,\nthis is called router on a stick.\n\n501\n00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.070\nInner VLAN routing with router ports.\n\n502\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.896\nNow what I can do,\n\n503\n00:24:17.896 --> 00:24:21.160\nthis is probably the best way to do\na relan routing if you can afford it.\n\n504\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.163\nYou have these gigabit ports,\none for each VLAN.\n\n505\n00:24:23.163 --> 00:24:26.815\nYou basically have separate subnets,\nright, and so\n\n506\n00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:29.340\nyou know this is a way you can do this.\n\n507\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.800\nI actually have some customers\nthat do it this way.\n\n508\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.019\nIt actually gives you a lot of throughput,\n\n509\n00:24:34.019 --> 00:24:37.790\nit's not very efficient though in\nthe sense of financial setup, is it?\n\n510\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.160\nBecause you're using\na gigabit port on a router.\n\n511\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.620\nThis is gonna cost more money then\na Layer 3 switch in this case.\n\n512\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:50.042\nSo, in this case here, I have one access\nport going into each router port.\n\n513\n00:24:50.042 --> 00:24:54.010\nSo typically what we'll see is\nsomething more like this, so\n\n514\n00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.690\nit was three going into one,\nand then we have\n\n515\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.370\nwhat's called the router on a stick here\nwhere I have this is a trunk port now.\n\n516\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.250\nI'm only using one interface for\nall VLANS.\n\n517\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.897\nAnd that's the way I do this\nsub-interface, is one for\n\n518\n00:25:07.897 --> 00:25:09.032\neach VLAN in this case.\n\n519\n00:25:09.032 --> 00:25:13.767\nSo, instead of multiple ports\non a router using those,\n\n520\n00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:20.534\nwe can do the same thing efficiently with\none port by trunking the switchboard.\n\n521\n00:25:20.534 --> 00:25:23.550\nWe trunk this port here,\nsubinterfaces on the router.\n\n522\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.730\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n523\n00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.783\nSo what I do is I create\nlogical interfaces,\n\n524\n00:25:27.783 --> 00:25:30.268\nseparating them out on the router.\n\n525\n00:25:30.268 --> 00:25:32.340\nNow let's talk about\nwhat I have written here.\n\n526\n00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.650\nPhysical interface is going to be\ndivided into multiple subinterfaces,\n\n527\n00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.140\none subnet per VLAN, one address space.\n\n528\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.607\nAnd then one subinterface.\n\n529\n00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:44.212\nNow the last line sounds a little\nconfusing, lets go through it.\n\n530\n00:25:44.212 --> 00:25:49.244\nSo subinterface encapsulation\nidentifiers must match VLAN tags.\n\n531\n00:25:49.244 --> 00:25:52.389\nIt sounds harder than it is.\n\n532\n00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:58.700\nSo I've got two VLANS here,\nVLAN one and two, 10.1.1 and 10.2.2.2.\n\n533\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.100\nWe're gonna trunk this port, not\nthe router port, trunk the switch port and\n\n534\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.550\nthen create subinterfaces here.\n\n535\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.102\nLet's take a look at what I did.\n\n536\n00:26:06.102 --> 00:26:10.779\nI don't really understand, it's got an IP\naddress underneath the physical interface,\n\n537\n00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:14.548\nand then I created a subinterface for\nVLAN2 Fastethernet 0/0.2.\n\n538\n00:26:14.548 --> 00:26:15.750\nDoesn't matter what number I use.\n\n539\n00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.416\nWhen we look to those loopback's,\nyesterday I think it was,\n\n540\n00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:19.708\nthen we saw there was, what?\n\n541\n00:26:19.708 --> 00:26:23.380\n2.4 billion different\noptions we can use here.\n\n542\n00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.350\nBut the point is,\nI usually have it match my VLANs.\n\n543\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.210\nThat kind of administratively makes sense.\n\n544\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:31.640\nNow, so that subinterface is a member\nof VLAN 2, because I say in caps,\n\n545\n00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.514\nthis is my encapsulation identifier.\n\n546\n00:26:33.514 --> 00:26:37.535\nThis is what it means,\nencapsulation dot1q 2.\n\n547\n00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:40.984\nNow there's a reason I only have\none subinterface with two VLANs.\n\n548\n00:26:40.984 --> 00:26:41.929\nLet's take a look.\n\n549\n00:26:41.929 --> 00:26:47.550\nNow, by default and mostly on the CCNA\nthey just have the native VLAN as VLAN1.\n\n550\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.680\nIt's pretty rare that they don't.\n\n551\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.490\nThey could, but it's not very likely.\n\n552\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.920\nIn this case they don't.\n\n553\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.380\nSo if that's my native VLAN, notice\nI didn't tag it with a sub interface,\n\n554\n00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.130\nbecause in 802.1Q the native\nVLAN is untagged by default, so\n\n555\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.260\nI'm a member of VLAN1.\n\n556\n00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.020\nMeans that it's gonna have an IP address\nunderneath the physical interface, and\n\n557\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.710\nthen tag all my other VLANs.\n\n558\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.990\nBut I can have untagged\ntraffic in this case.\n\n559\n00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.390\nAnd that's what I did here,\nI only tagged VLAN 2.\n\n560\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.652\nAnd the IP addresses in here are the\ndefault gateways the hosts will have\n\n561\n00:27:15.652 --> 00:27:16.654\nconfigured as.\n\n562\n00:27:16.654 --> 00:27:17.620\n[COUGH] Oops.\n\n563\n00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.200\nOkay, let's take a look at\na router on a stick example.\n\n564\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.690\nWe'll go through this.\n\n565\n00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.450\nI'll go in here and take a look, but\nlet's take a look at this figure first.\n\n566\n00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.920\nOkay, so one of the things I know\nI have to do here very simply.\n\n567\n00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.080\nI go to this port.\n\n568\n00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.250\nThis is f01, and\nI'm gonna say switch port mode trunk.\n\n569\n00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.780\nRemember, CCNA only runs 802.1Q.\n\n570\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.960\nSwitch port mode trunk, I'm done with\nthe switch configuration, right?\n\n571\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.400\nNow I have to put these guys in their\ndifferent respective VLANs, but\n\n572\n00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.350\nother than putting the host in their\nrespective VLANs and trunk of this port,\n\n573\n00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.800\nthat's all I have to do.\n\n574\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.509\nSo we can see this VLAN 2 is Ports 2 and\n3, and VLAN 4 is Port 10.\n\n575\n00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:00.990\nAll right, so\nit looks like I have two VLANs, right?\n\n576\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.130\nPlus the native VLAN,\nwhich isn't even listed here.\n\n577\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.930\nSo we'll just create two sub interfaces\nthat need to tag both of these or\n\n578\n00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:10.320\nneither of the default VLAN.\n\n579\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.970\nSo under the switch here, interface f01.\n\n580\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.675\nThat's this port here.\n\n581\n00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:20.060\nI'm gonna trunk it, switchport mode trunk.\n\n582\n00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.170\nThen I go into each interface and\nsay switch port access VLAN two, for\n\n583\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.400\nports two and three,\nif we look at that are in VLAN two.\n\n584\n00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.750\nPorts two and three, and\nthen four is in VLAN ten.\n\n585\n00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.460\nPretty simple right here.\n\n586\n00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.450\nSwitch port access.\n\n587\n00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.470\nPut them in there.\n\n588\n00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.370\nTrunk that.\n\n589\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.280\nI'm done with the switch config.\n\n590\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.640\nThis is not hard, guys.\n\n591\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.910\nIt really is not.\n\n592\n00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.550\nNow let's take a look at\nthe router config though.\n\n593\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.580\nSo we're under Gi0/0.\n\n594\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.467\nSo I go to, typo right away, nice Todd.\n\n595\n00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:55.460\nGi0/0, I created the figure first.\n\n596\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.316\nAnd then I did the config here, all right.\n\n597\n00:28:57.316 --> 00:29:03.640\nDo they have different, you know what?\n\n598\n00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.610\nThey didn't have the subnets listed here.\n\n599\n00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.200\nAnd I really need to have the subnets\nlisted here to be able to get this\n\n600\n00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.690\nconfiguration done,\nbecause I need to know what my mask is.\n\n601\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.478\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n602\n00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:16.769\nInterface gig 0/0, Ip address,\nthis is my native VLAN, right,\n\n603\n00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:21.690\n192.168.10, and that's a 240 mask, right?\n\n604\n00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.510\nSlash 28, and\nthen I've got two other vlans,\n\n605\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.610\nvlan2 and vlan10, so\nI create a sub interface.\n\n606\n00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.930\nAnd by the way, the first command you\nhave to type in as encapsulation.\n\n607\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.580\nBy trying to put an IP address on\nyour sub interface you'll set a most\n\n608\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.410\nencapsulation first.\n\n609\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.730\nSo I'm gonna say encapsulation dot1Q\nvlan2, so my interface is part of vlan2.\n\n610\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.689\nI'm in this subnet 192 mask.\n\n611\n00:29:41.689 --> 00:29:44.170\nAnd then here's VLAN 10.\n\n612\n00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.010\nHere's my interface, my subinterface.\n\n613\n00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.760\nAgain, I don't have to use this number.\n\n614\n00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.610\nI highly recommend it.\n\n615\n00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.170\nIt makes it easier for you to read.\n\n616\n00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.583\nAnd that's a member of VLAN 2.\n\n617\n00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:55.350\nAnd then I have a different\nsubnet in here.\n\n618\n00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.610\nSo this is the 128 subnet.\n\n619\n00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.643\nWhat's my broadcast domain of\nthis last one here, Ronnie?\n\n620\n00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:08.520\n>> This is by 32.\n\n621\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.600\n>> It is.\n\n622\n00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.539\nMan, he's halfway there.\n\n623\n00:30:14.539 --> 00:30:17.931\n>> It'd be 150\n>> 159?\n\n624\n00:30:17.931 --> 00:30:18.720\n>> Yes.\n\n625\n00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.940\n>> Okay I just wanna make sure.\n\n626\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.180\n>> I love your confidence.\n\n627\n00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.180\n>> No I just wanna make sure.\n\n628\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.151\n>> Yeah absolutely you got 128, 160,\n\n629\n00:30:24.151 --> 00:30:27.118\nhe's absolutely right with\n32's broadcast 159, good.\n\n630\n00:30:27.118 --> 00:30:30.142\nThis is pretty simple here guys,\none of the things in here, we didn't list\n\n631\n00:30:30.142 --> 00:30:33.140\nthe subnets, so it would have made\nit a lot harder to configure this.\n\n632\n00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.900\nWe absolutely need to have\nthe subnets listed there and\n\n633\n00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.040\nnotice that when was the slash 28,\none slash 26,\n\n634\n00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.220\none slash 27, right so in that case here\nwe'd have to put in the first address.\n\n635\n00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.480\nNotice I just created the sub\ninterfaces will this start working?\n\n636\n00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.080\nAbsolutely, this is all I have to do.\n\n637\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.020\nI have to do a no shut.\n\n638\n00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.590\nI didn't see a no shut under gig 0/0,\nso we assume that's going to be there.\n\n639\n00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.190\nBut make sure you do a no shut, put\nyour two subinterfaces and you're done.\n\n640\n00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:01.760\nOne more thing before we do our lab,\nand that is, let's do it even easier,\n\n641\n00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.150\nI mean that was pretty simple,\nI gotta be honest that's pretty simple.\n\n642\n00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.287\nNow it's a little confusing\njust only at first,\n\n643\n00:31:06.287 --> 00:31:08.172\nonce you do it you're\nlike okay I got this.\n\n644\n00:31:08.172 --> 00:31:10.719\nI highly recommend running out,\nif you don't have your own gear,\n\n645\n00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:14.037\nrun out to packet tracer you can easily do\nthese labs, I don't think there's anything\n\n646\n00:31:14.037 --> 00:31:17.800\nI've done this week that you can't do in\npacker tracer, not so far, next week yes.\n\n647\n00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.946\nAll right, so in this case here,\nI'm gonna have a Layer 3 switch,\n\n648\n00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:23.280\nnotice it says I'm virtual\nLayer 3 switch here.\n\n649\n00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.390\n>> Okay.\n>> Virtual.\n\n650\n00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.840\n>> So well I wanted to make\nsure you guys knew that\n\n651\n00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.890\nthe router is running on the back plane\nof the switch is not really there, right?\n\n652\n00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.630\nSo it's just software right.\n\n653\n00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:35.940\nSo that's why I put that in there.\n\n654\n00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.640\nNotice I have a host VLAN 10 and\nthis is all I have to do.\n\n655\n00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.450\nI'm gonna configure my host to the IP\ndefault gateway or use DHCP obviously, but\n\n656\n00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.660\nI got VLAN 10 VLAN 20, so\nI'm gonna put these ports in VLAN 10 and\n\n657\n00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.456\n20 respectively.\n\n658\n00:31:47.456 --> 00:31:49.452\nExcuse me.\n\n659\n00:31:49.452 --> 00:31:53.960\n[COUGH] Now once that's done and\nmy IPs are done,\n\n660\n00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.480\nI can come over here and\nconfigure this switch.\n\n661\n00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.810\nNow the first thing you gotta do to make\nsure that's a Layer 3 enterprise switch,\n\n662\n00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.224\nand it's gonna work for you,\nconfig t, you type in iprouting.\n\n663\n00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:09.476\nIP routing.\n\n664\n00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:12.559\nIf that gives you an error,\nyou either have the wrong switch or\n\n665\n00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.550\nthe wrong software, or both, right.\n\n666\n00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.647\nSo get that fixed then type in ip routing.\n\n667\n00:32:16.647 --> 00:32:20.881\nNow once you're done with that,\nnow I'm gonna create routed ports,\n\n668\n00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:25.830\nwe already have VLAN 1 on there for\nour native VLAN, that's our default.\n\n669\n00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.670\nWe can create a different one for\nour native VLAN.\n\n670\n00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:34.886\nBut in this case here, interface VLAN 10,\nwhen I use the command interface,\n\n671\n00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:40.934\nnow that's completely different\nthan saying config t VLAN 10.\n\n672\n00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:42.870\nThat's creating a VLAN,\nputting it in the database.\n\n673\n00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.730\nNow I can assign ports in that VLAN.\n\n674\n00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:50.450\nIf I said config t interface VLAN 10,\nI'm now creating a router port,\n\n675\n00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.660\nnow creating a router port for VLAN 10.\n\n676\n00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.840\nNow I put an IP address under there,\nI don't have to do a noshut,\n\n677\n00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.198\nit's a logical port, and\nnow the host will be able to communicate.\n\n678\n00:32:59.198 --> 00:33:05.820\nNow I'm gonna put one in here for\ninterface VLAN 20.\n\n679\n00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.289\nThat's a router port for VLAN 20.\n\n680\n00:33:08.289 --> 00:33:11.741\nAll I have to do is create a router\nport for each and every one,\n\n681\n00:33:11.741 --> 00:33:17.210\nput an ip address underneath there and\nthat's the default gateway of the host.\n\n682\n00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.965\nAnd now these guys will\nbe able to go like this.\n\n683\n00:33:18.965 --> 00:33:21.520\nIt'll go through the virtual\nrouter in the back plane.\n\n684\n00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.040\nI no longer need the router on a stick.\n\n685\n00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.440\nI'm just going through the switch,\ndo an inter-VLAN routing.\n\n686\n00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.420\nThis is the best way to go, right.\n\n687\n00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.110\nNo doubt about it,\nit's the most efficient.\n\n688\n00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.260\nIt's all I use with my\ncustomers in Enterprise.\n\n689\n00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.980\nI haven't seen router on a stick for\na while.\n\n690\n00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.250\nI'm not saying that it's necessarily bad.\n\n691\n00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.370\nIn a small network it's free, like\na small branch with three, four, five,\n\n692\n00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:41.630\nsix users, we can do router on a stick and\nhave multiple VLANs, okay.\n\n693\n00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:42.980\nThat's as hard as this gets.\n\n694\n00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.540\nThis is relatively simple.\n\n695\n00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.420\nPlease just remember,\n\n696\n00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:51.580\ninterface VLAN 10 is much different\nthan typing in VLAN 10, isn't it?\n\n697\n00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.360\nI'm creating a router port for\nVLAN 10 when I do the interface command.\n\n698\n00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.760\nLet's go out and run out and\ndo a couple quick labs here.\n\n699\n00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.210\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at our lab MI3 switches here,\n\n700\n00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.829\nswitch 1, 2 and 3 up here.\n\n701\n00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:10.657\nAnd [COUGH] I reloaded them, and so\nI don't have any configs on them.\n\n702\n00:34:10.657 --> 00:34:13.099\nAnd I just set my host names,\nthis is gonna be switched.\n\n703\n00:34:13.099 --> 00:34:16.247\nI already changed the host\nnames on the other ones.\n\n704\n00:34:16.247 --> 00:34:18.157\nHost name sw3.\n\n705\n00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:20.939\nSo it's important, the very first thing,\nguys, is set your host names,\n\n706\n00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:22.550\nespecially when you got TelNet like this.\n\n707\n00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.060\nSo here's what we're gonna do.\n\n708\n00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.998\nAnd we're going to,\nwhat are we gonna do, we're gonna do,\n\n709\n00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:30.764\nfirst we're gonna do trunking,\nthen we're gonna create our access ports.\n\n710\n00:34:30.764 --> 00:34:33.818\nThen we're gonna do router on a stick,\nlayer three routing, and\n\n711\n00:34:33.818 --> 00:34:36.402\nI wanna talk about something called VTP.\n\n712\n00:34:36.402 --> 00:34:38.310\nAll right, so in this case here,\nfor me to be able to\n\n713\n00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:44.530\ndo trunking I need to look\nat what my term ports are.\n\n714\n00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.332\nNow we can see here,\nall I'm seeing is S1 and S2, and\n\n715\n00:34:48.332 --> 00:34:51.564\nthis is awesome, 19, 20, 21, 22.\n\n716\n00:34:51.564 --> 00:34:54.751\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna do interface range.\n\n717\n00:34:54.751 --> 00:34:59.040\nInt range g0 19.\n\n718\n00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.968\nNow I'm only gonna do 19 and\n20, gonna do two at a time, and\n\n719\n00:35:01.968 --> 00:35:03.424\nI'll show you why in a second.\n\n720\n00:35:03.424 --> 00:35:10.820\nSwitchport trunk encap dot1q.\n\n721\n00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.390\nNow, this is not a CCNA objective.\n\n722\n00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:19.390\nI run both ISL and 802 dot1q and so now I\nhave to tell before I can turn trunking\n\n723\n00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.710\non which encapsulation I'm going to run.\n\n724\n00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.460\nYou won't have this on the c center CCNA..\n\n725\n00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.520\nAll right, so\nthis is what you do in real life.\n\n726\n00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.910\nI'm sorry I'm showing you\nreal life stuff here, too.\n\n727\n00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:33.500\nSo for trunk encapulation dot1q,\nI spelled encap wrong.\n\n728\n00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.680\nI really don't like that word encap.\n\n729\n00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.950\nAll right, encapsulation dot1q.\n\n730\n00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:44.590\nAll right, now we can go switchport,\nMode trunk.\n\n731\n00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.470\nNow I'm turning it on.\n\n732\n00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.430\nAgain, if I didn't set the encapsulation,\nit would've given me an error saying, hey,\n\n733\n00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.330\nyou have two options,\nwhich one you gonna do?\n\n734\n00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:54.420\nNotice I only did 19 and 20, that's\nbecause, notice they're going down and up.\n\n735\n00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.780\nThe other side is set to auto, and so\nwe're gonna see those come back up.\n\n736\n00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.510\nSo they went down and they came up, they\ntrunk, cuz they were undesirable auto.\n\n737\n00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.590\nSo basically, they desired to trunk and\nnow they did.\n\n738\n00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.403\nAnd this case here, I wanna do one\nmore thing across this trunk line.\n\n739\n00:36:10.403 --> 00:36:15.970\nSwitchport trunk native,\nI think it's native, right?\n\n740\n00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:20.333\nNative, there it is, native vlan 99.\n\n741\n00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:27.551\nSo I'm changing it from one, you guys\ncan't see that, from 1 to 99, 1 to 99.\n\n742\n00:36:27.551 --> 00:36:31.110\nAnd so now my native VLAN means\nuntagged frames are gonna cross 99.\n\n743\n00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.260\nWhat is it if I don't set the other side?\n\n744\n00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.480\nWell, nothing really, other than the CDP\nis gonna tell you every 60 seconds, hey,\n\n745\n00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.700\nman, native VLAN mismatch,\nnative VLAN mismatch.\n\n746\n00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.599\nBut if I leave frames coming here untagged\nin VLAN 99 they're going to end up on VLAN\n\n747\n00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:47.510\n1 on the other side because\nthat's the default.\n\n748\n00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.836\nAll right, so I wanted to leave that.\n\n749\n00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:51.920\nAll right, so that's all I had\nto do with the trunking here.\n\n750\n00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.100\nBut I want to do the range,\nwhere's my range,\n\n751\n00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.810\nnow we're gonna do 21 and 22 and\nI'll just do the same commands.\n\n752\n00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.581\nThere's my,\nI told you you're gonna fix it.\n\n753\n00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:06.371\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, I set it to dot1q so\n\n754\n00:37:06.371 --> 00:37:09.304\nI just typed in that, dot1q.\n\n755\n00:37:09.304 --> 00:37:11.971\nAnd switchport mode trunk.\n\n756\n00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:15.950\nOkay, so dot and dot and\nthat native VLAN now is gonna be 1.\n\n757\n00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:20.694\nI'm gonna leave that, and let me see, that\nwas 20, let's see which one goes to which.\n\n758\n00:37:24.763 --> 00:37:29.480\nOkay, so the other links are down because\nthey haven't come up as trunks yet.\n\n759\n00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.340\nSo 19 and 20 went to switch 1, so\nthat would mean 21, 22 went to switch 2.\n\n760\n00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.735\nSo those should probably pop up here.\n\n761\n00:37:35.735 --> 00:37:36.950\nI thought they said they came up.\n\n762\n00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.580\nNot yet,\nlet's go take a look at the other side.\n\n763\n00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.790\nTroubleshooting opportunity.\n\n764\n00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.722\nThere's switch 1, so\nthese links aren't working.\n\n765\n00:37:44.722 --> 00:37:47.942\nshow int trunk.\n\n766\n00:37:47.942 --> 00:37:50.780\nThere's 19 and 20, so\nthose are the ones that we did.\n\n767\n00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.780\nSo we can see that they were set to auto,\nthat's why they came up.\n\n768\n00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.590\nNow again I'm telling you, don't do that.\n\n769\n00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.204\nNow we have a NATIVE_VLAN_MISMATCH\nbecause on switch 1, it's 1.\n\n770\n00:37:58.204 --> 00:38:01.525\nSo let's go here and go to, now the other\nside just came up it looks like.\n\n771\n00:38:01.525 --> 00:38:07.912\nI just saw that one over there\n(config)t int range f0/19.\n\n772\n00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:10.800\nNotice we have gigabit\nconnecting that fast ethernet.\n\n773\n00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.900\nYes, you can do that because they're 10,\n100, 1000 ports, when these are 10, 100.\n\n774\n00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.070\nBut they're only running 100 as\nwe'll take a look at in a second.\n\n775\n00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.529\nA switchport, we wanna set trunk, and\n\n776\n00:38:22.529 --> 00:38:26.723\nI gotta spell encap right, dot1q.\n\n777\n00:38:26.723 --> 00:38:30.927\nNow I don't really need to do that,\ndo I, because it already said, hey, we\n\n778\n00:38:30.927 --> 00:38:36.070\nnegotiated, the n stands for negotiated,\nusing DTP, dynamic trunk protocol.\n\n779\n00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.290\nOkay, we're not negotiating this,\nset to auto, but\n\n780\n00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.100\nthe reason I'm doing this is because\nI wanna set it to static, okay?\n\n781\n00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.783\nSwitchport mode trunk,\nwhich means I'm turning it on, okay?\n\n782\n00:38:45.783 --> 00:38:53.700\nAnd then I'm gonna say switchport\ntrunk native vlan 99, okay?\n\n783\n00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.300\nOkay, that came up at the same time.\n\n784\n00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:05.580\nSo if I did show int trunk, and\nnow we see the mode is on, I turned it on.\n\n785\n00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.986\nThis 802.1q, it's not negotiated,\nmy native VLAN is 99, so\n\n786\n00:39:08.986 --> 00:39:11.774\nnow I'm working between switch 1 and\nswitch 3, okay.\n\n787\n00:39:11.774 --> 00:39:16.670\nSo let's go over here and\nsee If my other VLANs came up.\n\n788\n00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:22.655\nOkay, so these are saying they're\nreally unhappy, aren't they?\n\n789\n00:39:22.655 --> 00:39:23.584\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n790\n00:39:23.584 --> 00:39:27.480\nit received a 802 dot1q non-trunking.\n\n791\n00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.692\nReceived what's called a bridge protocol.\n\n792\n00:39:28.692 --> 00:39:32.469\nWhen we get to ICD 2, the first section we\ngo through Is spanning tree which we're\n\n793\n00:39:32.469 --> 00:39:34.851\ngonna talk about bridge\nprotocol data units here.\n\n794\n00:39:34.851 --> 00:39:37.780\nSo it's unhappy, so well, let's do this.\n\n795\n00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.490\nShow in trunk, nothing, show vlan.\n\n796\n00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.690\nOkay, so what were the ports,\nit was 21 and 22, right?\n\n797\n00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.270\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n798\n00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:50.720\nguys, when I did a show vlan here,\nthis shows me my access ports.\n\n799\n00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.899\nNotice 21 and 22 are in here.\n\n800\n00:39:52.899 --> 00:39:55.099\nIf you're on your exam and\nsomeone says, hey,\n\n801\n00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:59.115\nyou're only sending information about VLAN\n1 because they're VLAN 1 in this case,\n\n802\n00:39:59.115 --> 00:40:00.947\nyou do a show VLAN and see them in there.\n\n803\n00:40:00.947 --> 00:40:03.271\nThey're obviously not\ntrunked cuz they're in here.\n\n804\n00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:05.023\nThey wouldn't be in here\nif they're trunked.\n\n805\n00:40:05.023 --> 00:40:08.984\nSo let's go ahead and switchport,\n\n806\n00:40:08.984 --> 00:40:13.082\nwhoops, I got 21, 22, right?\n\n807\n00:40:13.082 --> 00:40:13.629\n>> Right.\n\n808\n00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:25.691\n>> Switchport trunk encap dot1q.\n\n809\n00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:27.544\nOkay, I'm going to leave this as 1.\n\n810\n00:40:27.544 --> 00:40:30.470\nI didn't change the other one either so\nour native vlan is 1.\n\n811\n00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.260\nAll right, and\nthen I need to turn them on.\n\n812\n00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.970\nSwitchport mode trunk.\n\n813\n00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.490\nI'm not even typing in very many words so\nI hope you can see that.\n\n814\n00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.385\nSo I turned, the first thing I did and\nso they went down, that's fine,\n\n815\n00:40:41.385 --> 00:40:43.410\nswitchport trunk encap dot1q.\n\n816\n00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.085\nSwitchport mode trunk.\n\n817\n00:40:46.085 --> 00:40:50.293\nDo show trunk.\n\n818\n00:40:50.293 --> 00:40:52.997\nDo show trunk.\n\n819\n00:40:52.997 --> 00:40:56.050\n[LAUGH] I forgot I did a Ctrl+Z.\n\n820\n00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.150\nShow int trunk, guys.\n\n821\n00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.481\nOkay, in there.\n\n822\n00:41:02.481 --> 00:41:04.360\nNow we can see 21 and 22 is on.\n\n823\n00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.132\nEncapsulation didn't negotiate and\nmy native vlan is 1.\n\n824\n00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:13.025\nSo if came back down here and\ndid a sh int trunk, yes,\n\n825\n00:41:13.025 --> 00:41:17.489\nI'll make it bigger,\nstand by, sh int trunk.\n\n826\n00:41:17.489 --> 00:41:22.710\nAnd so we can see that 19 and\n20, none of them are negotiated.\n\n827\n00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.010\nYou shouldn't really have\nnegotiated links today.\n\n828\n00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.690\nTurn them on, okay?\n\n829\n00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:33.300\nNative vlan 99, going up to switch 1,\nthen vlan 1 go into switch 2.\n\n830\n00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.400\nThis is fine, you can do that.\n\n831\n00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.140\nThey have to be the same on both sides,\nnot throughout your entire network,\n\n832\n00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.100\nno big deal.\n\n833\n00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.490\nNotice all my VLANs that are allowed,\nthese are the VLANs that we're using.\n\n834\n00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.079\nAll right, now, so on switch 3,\nI'm just gonna create some VLANs.\n\n835\n00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:54.149\n[COUGH] vlan 3 name,\nwhoops, can't do that.\n\n836\n00:41:54.149 --> 00:41:55.412\nUsed to be able to do that.\n\n837\n00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:57.293\nname Sales.\n\n838\n00:41:57.293 --> 00:42:03.250\nvlan 4, name, whoops, I can't do that.\n\n839\n00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.540\nI'm old school, guys.\n\n840\n00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:09.110\nName, vlan 4, name Voice, okay?\n\n841\n00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.267\nDo show vlan.\n\n842\n00:42:13.656 --> 00:42:16.316\nOkay, there's my 1, and there's 2 and 3.\n\n843\n00:42:16.316 --> 00:42:20.780\nNotice I have these other VLANs that I\nguess I had created in here at one time.\n\n844\n00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.697\nBut anyways, I have,\nthe way to get those out of there,\n\n845\n00:42:23.697 --> 00:42:28.460\nyou can delete your VLAN database or\nyou say no VLAN 10, no VLAN 20, whatever.\n\n846\n00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.540\nSo I create, I have two as sales.\n\n847\n00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.136\nIt took it because that was a smaller S.\n\n848\n00:42:33.136 --> 00:42:36.974\nNo VLAN 20.\n\n849\n00:42:36.974 --> 00:42:39.259\nIf they would have both been capital S,\nit wouldn't even have taken it,\n\n850\n00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:40.390\nit would have said duplicate name.\n\n851\n00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.251\n>> And your Voice VLAN didn't show up,\nthe one that you named Voice.\n\n852\n00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:45.436\n>> Which one did I do that one for?\n\n853\n00:42:45.436 --> 00:42:47.985\n>> 4, I believe,\nthat's the one that you created.\n\n854\n00:42:47.985 --> 00:42:49.226\n>> Was there a voice in here?\n\n855\n00:42:49.226 --> 00:42:52.212\nNo, vlan for name,\n\n856\n00:42:52.212 --> 00:42:58.200\nI couldn't really tell, so show vlan.\n\n857\n00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.390\nOkay, good, now we've got a sales invoice.\n\n858\n00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:07.390\nSo now I can come in here and\nsay config t.\n\n859\n00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.815\nHow do I add it to an interface?\n\n860\n00:43:09.815 --> 00:43:17.209\nint vlan 3, so now I'm into,\nnope, I didn't mean to do that.\n\n861\n00:43:17.209 --> 00:43:20.609\nI meant to go to, hold on, sorry.\n\n862\n00:43:20.609 --> 00:43:27.921\nI want to go to int f0/3, g0/3.\n\n863\n00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:31.539\nAnd we usually would use a question\nmark or show ip interface brief,\n\n864\n00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:34.789\nbut when the f didn't work I\nknew it had been gigged, right?\n\n865\n00:43:34.789 --> 00:43:37.190\nSo now I'm into an interface.\n\n866\n00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.590\nNow how do I add a VLAN\ninto this interface?\n\n867\n00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:41.240\n>> Switchport.\n\n868\n00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.576\n>>

got 3 and 4.\n\n872\n00:43:50.767 --> 00:43:54.013\nSo the access bars will say vlan data,\nright,\n\n873\n00:43:54.013 --> 00:43:57.680\nbecause I can only put\none VLAN on per port.\n\n874\n00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.009\nHowever, I can put different types\nof VLANs, so if I said switchport,\n\n875\n00:44:02.009 --> 00:44:05.780\nvoice vlan 4, I can do that, right.\n\n876\n00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.138\nAnd that's when I have my laptop or\ncapability of plugging into my phone and\n\n877\n00:44:09.138 --> 00:44:10.216\nmy phone into the jack.\n\n878\n00:44:10.216 --> 00:44:12.767\nAnd I wanna separate the data\nwhen it gets to the switch.\n\n879\n00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:14.985\nSo if I do, do show VLAN,\n\n880\n00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:22.534\nI keep doing a Do Now when I do a Ctrl+Z.\n\n881\n00:44:22.534 --> 00:44:27.934\nOkay, now we can see there's Sales 3 and\n4.\n\n882\n00:44:27.934 --> 00:44:30.133\nThey're both on my Port 3.\n\n883\n00:44:30.133 --> 00:44:32.283\nYou can't put two VLANs on the same port,\n\n884\n00:44:32.283 --> 00:44:36.910\nexcept if they're different types of\nVLANs, data and voice, in this example.\n\n885\n00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:40.860\nSo get our trunking done, and we could\ngo in and configure all our VLANs, and\n\n886\n00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.790\nthis is how we do it.\n\n887\n00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.630\nSwitchport access, switchport voice, okay?\n\n888\n00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.788\nAnd now we can do a router on a stick,\nso hold on, let me do, whoops.\n\n889\n00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:53.580\nShow cdp neighbor, okay.\n\n890\n00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.298\nI'm not seeing anybody off of there.\n\n891\n00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:59.328\nI know why,\nI turned off my port here on my router.\n\n892\n00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:04.884\nOkay.\n\n893\n00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.005\nOkay, so, let's see if those come up.\n\n894\n00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.095\nThey may or may not.\n\n895\n00:45:17.095 --> 00:45:18.257\nGive it one minute here, guys,\n\n896\n00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:21.610\nbear with me and I'll run up to another\nswitch here if this doesn't come up.\n\n897\n00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:26.080\nShould be, show ip int brief.\n\n898\n00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.370\nOkay, I'm seeing f0/0's up and up,\n\n899\n00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:35.012\nso he's definitely connected to someone,\njust not to this guy.\n\n900\n00:45:35.012 --> 00:45:38.450\nI'm on switch 3, that's why,\nhe doesn't connect to switch 3.\n\n901\n00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.240\nOver here, let's go to switch 1 and\nwe'll see my router now.\n\n902\n00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.250\nOkay, so it's sh cdp nei.\n\n903\n00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.050\nAnd I should see Corp right there.\n\n904\n00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.270\nHe's off of f0/1, why is this important?\n\n905\n00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.820\nBecause I'm gonna go ahead and use\nthe Corp router as a router on a stick.\n\n906\n00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.480\nHe's gonna be my router.\n\n907\n00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.430\nIt doesn't matter which\nswitch I connect him to.\n\n908\n00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.810\nThe switches are all\ninterconnected with trunk links.\n\n909\n00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:04.000\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nsay config t, int F0/1.\n\n910\n00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.230\nSo I'm connected to Corp,\nswitchport, okay.\n\n911\n00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.210\nSo I have to first set the encapsulation.\n\n912\n00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.859\nNow that's not a CCNA objective, okay.\n\n913\n00:46:14.859 --> 00:46:19.940\nSwitchport, all this is, mode trunk.\n\n914\n00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.284\nThat's all you have to do on\nthe CCNA is turn on trunking, right.\n\n915\n00:46:23.284 --> 00:46:26.160\nWe can set our native VLAN, we're just\ngonna leave it as 1 for right now.\n\n916\n00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.615\nThat makes it pretty simple.\n\n917\n00:46:27.615 --> 00:46:29.850\nSo I'm gonna make a subnet up for\neach one.\n\n918\n00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.684\nWe've got subnets 1, 3, and 4.\n\n919\n00:46:32.684 --> 00:46:37.530\nAnd we got, 1 is my native VLAN,\nit's 99 on those other guys, right.\n\n920\n00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:41.080\nSo, but it doesn't matter, we can set it\nin there, and it'll switch from 99 to 1,\n\n921\n00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:41.725\npretty funny.\n\n922\n00:46:41.725 --> 00:46:43.546\nBut anyways, so that's up.\n\n923\n00:46:43.546 --> 00:46:45.521\nAnd then I trunked this port.\n\n924\n00:46:45.521 --> 00:46:47.708\nThat's all I have to do here, that's it.\n\n925\n00:46:50.397 --> 00:46:53.980\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna come back here to my router.\n\n926\n00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.206\nI trunk to the port coming into\nthe Corp off of Fast Ethernet 0/0.\n\n927\n00:46:58.206 --> 00:46:59.832\nHe's 10.10.10.1.\n\n928\n00:46:59.832 --> 00:47:02.535\nThat's fine, my Corp is 10.10.10.1.\n\n929\n00:47:02.535 --> 00:47:07.273\nI can make this port here,\nit's part of my native VLAN, so\n\n930\n00:47:07.273 --> 00:47:09.704\nif I did show run int f0/0.\n\n931\n00:47:09.704 --> 00:47:12.414\nThere he is 10.10.10.1,\nthat's my native VLAN.\n\n932\n00:47:12.414 --> 00:47:15.668\nAll these subinterfaces for\nVLAN 2, so I'll do this.\n\n933\n00:47:15.668 --> 00:47:20.094\nint f0/0., we have 3 and\n\n934\n00:47:20.094 --> 00:47:24.706\n4, .3 int f/0/0.4.\n\n935\n00:47:24.706 --> 00:47:27.304\nNow I have two router ports,\none for each of my VLANs.\n\n936\n00:47:27.304 --> 00:47:30.334\nI have my native VLAN,\nwhich is 1 in this case, and\n\n937\n00:47:30.334 --> 00:47:32.662\nthen I have 3 and 4 for VLANs 3 and 4.\n\n938\n00:47:32.662 --> 00:47:36.000\nAgain, I could use any number, but\nwe're gonna make them match our VLANs.\n\n939\n00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.750\n>> Now Todd,\nwill you check something for me again?\n\n940\n00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:42.310\nI thought it was connected\nf0/1 on your switch.\n\n941\n00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.000\n>> Let's take a look.\n\n942\n00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.960\n>> I think.\n\n943\n00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.200\n>> I didn't look on this guy.\n\n944\n00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.710\nShow CDP.\n\n945\n00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:47.808\n>> I could be wrong.\n\n946\n00:47:47.808 --> 00:47:49.600\n>> I thought it said f0/0,\nbut I didn't look.\n\n947\n00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.470\n>> It was me.\n\n948\n00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.983\n>> So.\n\n949\n00:47:50.983 --> 00:47:52.130\n>> Nope, you're right.\n\n950\n00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.640\nNo, that's the.\n\n951\n00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.173\n>> He's off of f0/0.\n\n952\n00:47:53.173 --> 00:47:54.346\n>> Okay, cool, okay.\n\n953\n00:47:54.346 --> 00:47:57.059\n>> No, it's good,\nhe's absolutely right here.\n\n954\n00:47:57.059 --> 00:47:58.412\nAlways verify.\n\n955\n00:47:58.412 --> 00:48:00.100\nRight, he made me think for a second.\n\n956\n00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.045\nWait, I never checked to see how my\nswitch Which port I was connected into\n\n957\n00:48:03.045 --> 00:48:03.780\nthe Corp router.\n\n958\n00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.547\nI thought it was f0/0, and I'm right.\n\n959\n00:48:05.547 --> 00:48:10.468\nSo [LAUGH] yeah, that's right,\nsh run int f0/0.\n\n960\n00:48:10.468 --> 00:48:12.736\nOkay, so I can see I'm 10.10.10.1.\n\n961\n00:48:12.736 --> 00:48:16.597\nSo I'm gonna go to my switches now,\nso here's switch three, and\n\n962\n00:48:16.597 --> 00:48:18.295\nI'm gonna go to switch one.\n\n963\n00:48:21.127 --> 00:48:23.742\nAnd I'm gonna say int vlan 1.\n\n964\n00:48:23.742 --> 00:48:26.267\nIp address 10.10.10.2.\n\n965\n00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.827\nMy default gateway is 10.10.10.1, so\n\n966\n00:48:31.827 --> 00:48:36.705\nI'm gonna say,\nip default gateway 10.10.10.1 Right?\n\n967\n00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.095\nI don't have to tag any of this.\n\n968\n00:48:38.095 --> 00:48:40.595\nNow it's gonna be an issue\nwhen we get to that 99, right?\n\n969\n00:48:40.595 --> 00:48:42.365\nAnyways, yes?\n\n970\n00:48:42.365 --> 00:48:44.825\n>> You've got a duplicate address there.\n\n971\n00:48:44.825 --> 00:48:46.075\nOn your interface VLAN1.\n\n972\n00:48:46.075 --> 00:48:47.315\n>> I must have put him somewhere.\n\n973\n00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:48.865\n>> I think you put him on interface VLAN1.\n\n974\n00:48:48.865 --> 00:48:53.640\n>> I put him here, but\nwhere did I have him before though?\n\n975\n00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.460\n>> I don't know.\n\n976\n00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.550\n>> He's 10.10.10.1,-\n>> Okay.\n\n977\n00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:59.520\n>> I'll find him, I might have\nput him on a router or something.\n\n978\n00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.020\n>> Okay.\n>> I'll find it.\n\n979\n00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.020\n>> All right.\n\n980\n00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.885\n>> What I can do is say, you know what?\n\n981\n00:49:02.885 --> 00:49:04.560\nScrew it right now.\n\n982\n00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.000\nMost of the time I'd stay and fix that.\n\n983\n00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.940\nSo I've got to go back into VLAN 1,\ngo back in here, and\n\n984\n00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.290\nit'll just change this to three,\nand I'll find that later.\n\n985\n00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.600\nSo okay, so we'll do three four and five.\n\n986\n00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.510\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay.\n\n987\n00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.480\nSo then switch three will be five.\n\n988\n00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:25.680\nInterface VLAN 1,\nIP address 10.10.10.4 right?\n\n989\n00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:32.320\nExit IP default gateway, 10.10.10.1.\n\n990\n00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.300\nOkay, so that's both those switches.\n\n991\n00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.000\nAnd then I've got two, three.\n\n992\n00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.830\n>> Switch two.\n\n993\n00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:39.880\n>> Switch two over here.\n\n994\n00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.990\nCome on, hey, don't do that to me.\n\n995\n00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:49.583\nconfig t, int vlan 1,\nip address 10.10.10.3.\n\n996\n00:49:54.215 --> 00:49:56.560\nNo shut, I got to make sure!\n\n997\n00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.470\nIs that the one I used?\n\n998\n00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:01.220\n>> I think so, I think you used\n10.10.3 on the first one that you did.\n\n999\n00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.710\n>> So I did three four and\nthis guy's supposed to be five?\n\n1000\n00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:04.900\nOkay that's fine.\n\n1001\n00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.990\nAnd, I had to do a no shut, but I'm\npretty sure I had done a no shut before.\n\n1002\n00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:09.320\nBut those are shut down.\n\n1003\n00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.630\nIP default gateway, 10.10.10.1.\n\n1004\n00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.632\nSo what did I do guys?\n\n1005\n00:50:13.632 --> 00:50:15.590\nReally nothing, I set my management VLAN.\n\n1006\n00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.600\nThis is just from management traffic.\n\n1007\n00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.200\nIt's untagged.\n\n1008\n00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.480\nNow we're gonna see it switch and\nit's gonna give us an error.\n\n1009\n00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.630\nIt's actually gonna work though, but when\nwe get from switch one to two over here,\n\n1010\n00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:31.660\nbecause there our native VLAN 99 and\nit's gonna send on-tag traffic that way.\n\n1011\n00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.590\nAll right.\n\n1012\n00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:35.380\nNow I've got that done and\nI've got my gateway.\n\n1013\n00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.970\nLet's go back to my router now.\n\n1014\n00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.450\nSo that's my native vlan.\n\n1015\n00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.942\nHe is untagged.\n\n1016\n00:50:39.942 --> 00:50:43.535\nSo it means in one, three, four and five.\n\n1017\n00:50:43.535 --> 00:50:46.670\nI've got some averages I've got to\nfind somewhere, but nonetheless,\n\n1018\n00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:48.860\nthis is just for\nme to talk to my switches.\n\n1019\n00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.230\nI don't have to have this here.\n\n1020\n00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.880\nI recommend it though and\nnotice I said the default gateway here.\n\n1021\n00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.784\nThat means that, from another vlan,\nI can get in and manage those switches.\n\n1022\n00:50:56.784 --> 00:50:58.570\nNow, let's go back in here.\n\n1023\n00:50:58.570 --> 00:50:59.220\nInterface f0/0.3, right?\n\n1024\n00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.170\nThat was the one.\n\n1025\n00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:07.180\nSo the first thing you have to set guys,\nencapsulation dot1 queue 3,\n\n1026\n00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:12.130\nthis is for vlan, that encapsulation\nidentifier must match vlan tags.\n\n1027\n00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.570\nSo for vlan3, that's what I'm using.\n\n1028\n00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:15.952\nNow, I'm going to put my\nIP address in here and\n\n1029\n00:51:15.952 --> 00:51:18.247\nI've gotta make up some IP address.\n\n1030\n00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.550\nWhat do you think, 192.\n\n1031\n00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.560\nNope, let's not do that.\n\n1032\n00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.530\nHow about 10.30.30.1 is\nthe default gateway.\n\n1033\n00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.240\nThe host would be 30.30.\n\n1034\n00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:30.790\nwhatever.\n\n1035\n00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:31.900\nAnything else.\n\n1036\n00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.600\nOkay?\n\n1037\n00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.560\nSo that's my default gateway.\n\n1038\n00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.690\n30.30.1.\n\n1039\n00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.510\nAnd then int f0/0.4.\n\n1040\n00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:41.410\nThis is for my voice LAN and\nI have to set the encapsulation first.\n\n1041\n00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:47.850\nLet me show you if I set the IP address\nfirst, it's gonna give me an error,\n\n1042\n00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.470\nsaying you didn't set the encapsulation.\n\n1043\n00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.558\nIt makes it look really serious, right?\n\n1044\n00:51:51.558 --> 00:51:53.650\nAnd I'm gonna set that to VLAN 4.\n\n1045\n00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:58.830\nThen I'm gonna put this back in and\nnow I've got my routing done.\n\n1046\n00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:04.720\nSo show run, I think I can do this.\n\n1047\n00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.180\nI hate it when it does that.\n\n1048\n00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.067\nI need my logging synchronous on.\n\n1049\n00:52:09.067 --> 00:52:13.572\nShow run include f0/0, see if that works.\n\n1050\n00:52:13.572 --> 00:52:15.928\nNo, all right, let's do it this way.\n\n1051\n00:52:17.908 --> 00:52:24.848\nOkay, [SOUND] so\nhere's my router on a stick.\n\n1052\n00:52:24.848 --> 00:52:27.970\nI am trunked from the switch at f0/0.\n\n1053\n00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.585\nI have my native VLAN untagged\nunderneath the physical interface as\n\n1054\n00:52:31.585 --> 00:52:32.960\n10.10.10 network.\n\n1055\n00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:40.560\nThen I have the 10.30.30 sub net for\nvlan 3 .1Q3, 10.40.40 sub net for vlan4.\n\n1056\n00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.050\nOkay so now we've done that,\nwe set our trunks,\n\n1057\n00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:47.870\nwe set our access links, we would've\ngone in there and set all our access and\n\n1058\n00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:51.110\nvoice links, we set our sub\ninterface to the router on a stick.\n\n1059\n00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:55.210\nOkay now that's all fine, but I could\ncome back here and say, you know what?\n\n1060\n00:52:55.210 --> 00:53:00.150\nI don't wanna use this so I'm gonna say\nI don't even wanna use that f0/0 so\n\n1061\n00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.230\nI can just shut that down.\n\n1062\n00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:06.510\nI believe it was on\nf0/0 show cdp neighbor.\n\n1063\n00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:12.590\nAnd to get to corp was\nf 0/1 off of here okay.\n\n1064\n00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:13.773\nAnd that was the one I trunked.\n\n1065\n00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:14.273\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1066\n00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:19.820\n>> Okay, and I'm gonna say interface\nf0/1 and since that was my routing,\n\n1067\n00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.940\nI'm going to shut that off now cause\nI\"m not gonna use that as my router.\n\n1068\n00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.150\nRight, so he's all down.\n\n1069\n00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:26.100\nIt's like, okay, that trunks down.\n\n1070\n00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.330\nNo longer use that as a router.\n\n1071\n00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:29.660\nI would do it differently in production.\n\n1072\n00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.930\nI would clear out the config,\nbut we are just in the test lab.\n\n1073\n00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:33.140\nI'm just shutting that down.\n\n1074\n00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.700\nCuz I wanna do a different router.\n\n1075\n00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.210\nNow what I'm gonna do here is\nI'm gonna use this switch.\n\n1076\n00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:39.870\nDoesn't matter which one you use,\njust use one, though.\n\n1077\n00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:45.150\nAnd I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna say, config t, [COUGH]\n\n1078\n00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:48.020\ninterface vlan 3.\n\n1079\n00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.430\nThat's different than saying vlan 3.\n\n1080\n00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.650\nI'm now creating a router interface.\n\n1081\n00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:57.010\nOkay, now, underneath there,\nI'm gonna say,\n\n1082\n00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:01.580\nI don't need to say in cap,\nwe all ready got that on our trunks.\n\n1083\n00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:07.330\nWe understand what were running so\nI'm gonna say IP address and 10.30.30.1.\n\n1084\n00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:11.622\nI should be able to use this\ncuz I shut down that other one.\n\n1085\n00:54:11.622 --> 00:54:19.249\nOkay, then interface vlan 4 for vlan 4.\n\n1086\n00:54:19.249 --> 00:54:28.357\nAnd then 40.40.1.\n\n1087\n00:54:28.357 --> 00:54:34.190\nAnd so, if I did a shell run,\nI'm gonna see my routed ports now.\n\n1088\n00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.610\nOkay, somewhere, there's vlan1.\n\n1089\n00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:44.610\nThere's 10.10.3 that I had sent over here.\n\n1090\n00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.490\nThis would be my routed port now,\nso I would come under here and say,\n\n1091\n00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:54.311\nconfig t int vlan 1,\nip address 10.10.10.1.\n\n1092\n00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:57.115\nAll right, it likes masks sometimes\n\n1093\n00:54:57.115 --> 00:55:07.250\n[LAUGH].\n\n1094\n00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.750\nOkay.\n\n1095\n00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.530\nSo there's my routers, my router ports.\n\n1096\n00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.075\nNow except my host to\ndefault gateway setting.\n\n1097\n00:55:13.075 --> 00:55:14.160\nNow you can set these on other switches,\n\n1098\n00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.970\ndon't use the same IP address, and\nthen don't set the host to those.\n\n1099\n00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.050\nSo I can use one switch for\n\n1100\n00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:21.530\nsome router ports, another switch for\nsome router ports.\n\n1101\n00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:22.450\nIt gets a little confusing.\n\n1102\n00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:24.880\nI like to use the same\nswitch as my router.\n\n1103\n00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.700\nTypically my core, like a 4500 or\nsomething like that.\n\n1104\n00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.050\nIt's pretty nice cores.\n\n1105\n00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.360\nYou know a 9500 access\nthat's something like that.\n\n1106\n00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.220\nInterface Vlan1.\n\n1107\n00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.430\nHere's my untake traffic to vlan1 and then\nI got vlan3 and 4 and these are going to\n\n1108\n00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:42.310\nbe for, notice the tag here is\nthe actual interface name, okay?\n\n1109\n00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:45.340\nAll right, so\none more thing I wanna show you guys.\n\n1110\n00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.590\nSo I want you guys to try that,\nuse router on a stick and\n\n1111\n00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:50.480\nmy interface as a router port.\n\n1112\n00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.514\nI wanna show you something, show vtp,\nit's not in the objectives for\n\n1113\n00:55:55.514 --> 00:55:59.197\nC set, but just pay attention for\none second here.\n\n1114\n00:55:59.197 --> 00:56:02.332\nOkay I'm gonna do show vtp status.\n\n1115\n00:56:02.332 --> 00:56:05.731\nVirtual trunk protocol really doesn't\nhave anything to do with trunking,\n\n1116\n00:56:05.731 --> 00:56:07.890\nit just sends updates down trunk links.\n\n1117\n00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:11.260\nAnd what this does is, I build a database\nhere, of VLANs three and four, for\n\n1118\n00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.500\nexample, it'll send it down the trunk\nlinks to the other switches, and\n\n1119\n00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.040\nthey'll put it in their VLAN database.\n\n1120\n00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.590\nThis keeps naming consistent,\nmakes you don't screw up.\n\n1121\n00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.560\nWe don't use this too much, but\nit did show up on the objectives it\n\n1122\n00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.280\ngives try see me too, so\nI thought I'd bring it up.\n\n1123\n00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.510\nOkay, so\nthis guy's capable of running 1 through 3.\n\n1124\n00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.487\nIt's running version 1, domain name.\n\n1125\n00:56:31.487 --> 00:56:37.027\n[LAUGH] So #vtp domain Lanmle,\nI like that.\n\n1126\n00:56:37.027 --> 00:56:40.425\nNow, I don't know what this one was.\n\n1127\n00:56:40.425 --> 00:56:43.005\nBut anyways,\n[LAUGH] I changed my domain name.\n\n1128\n00:56:43.005 --> 00:56:45.615\nYou have to make sure it's\nthe same on every switch.\n\n1129\n00:56:45.615 --> 00:56:48.578\nNow the other thing is is\nthis should be server.\n\n1130\n00:56:48.578 --> 00:56:50.239\nWhere does it say?\n\n1131\n00:56:50.239 --> 00:56:52.870\n>> Right underneath that where it says-\n>> There it is, server.\n\n1132\n00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.745\nOkay, so server is the default,\nwhich means you can create, add, and\n\n1133\n00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:57.620\ndelete VLANs in the database.\n\n1134\n00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.800\nSo if they're all like that, a lot of\ntimes, they'll set the switches to client.\n\n1135\n00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.464\nNo one can create a VLAN on there,\n\n1136\n00:57:02.464 --> 00:57:04.968\nthey can only get a VLAN\ndatabase from our server.\n\n1137\n00:57:04.968 --> 00:57:06.327\nBut watch this for a second.\n\n1138\n00:57:06.327 --> 00:57:10.090\nI wanna say I'm a server,\nI'm gonna say #vlan 4001.\n\n1139\n00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:12.755\nOkay, #name, extended,\n\n1140\n00:57:17.004 --> 00:57:22.510\nOkay, now I did a Ctrl+Z, and\nit came out and told me something.\n\n1141\n00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.750\nExtended VLAN(s) not allowed\nin current VTP mode.\n\n1142\n00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:25.960\nFailed to commit changes.\n\n1143\n00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:31.170\nSo remember, our VLAN range is really 1 is\ndefault, and 1002 through 5 are default.\n\n1144\n00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:35.570\n1 through 1001 or 2 through 1001,\nwhich gives you 1000 VLANs.\n\n1145\n00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:38.030\nAnything above 1005 is the extended range,\nand\n\n1146\n00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:39.640\nyou have to be in what's\ncalled transparent mode.\n\n1147\n00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.998\nWhat transparent mode means,\nit's all about me.\n\n1148\n00:57:41.998 --> 00:57:43.870\nMy VLAN database is local,\nI don't share it.\n\n1149\n00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.330\nI don't receive VLAN information, nothing.\n\n1150\n00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:49.237\nSo like I said, it's a server,\nwhich is what I create, add, delete VLAN.\n\n1151\n00:57:49.237 --> 00:57:52.042\nSo I can set it to client, which means\nI only receive from a sever I set to\n\n1152\n00:57:52.042 --> 00:57:55.030\ntransparent, which I don't care\nabout anyone else but myself, right?\n\n1153\n00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:59.890\nAll right, so in this case here, I can't\ncreate VLANS unless in extended mode.\n\n1154\n00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:03.530\nI can't create extended VLANS,\nunless I'm in transparent mode.\n\n1155\n00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:07.320\nAll right, and show VTP status would\ntell me what my status is on the server.\n\n1156\n00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.274\nI can get up to 1005 VLAN, it's not true.\n\n1157\n00:58:09.274 --> 00:58:11.275\nI can go from 2 to 1001, but\n\n1158\n00:58:11.275 --> 00:58:16.031\nit counts those at default VLANS of 1,\n1002, 3, 4, and 5, okay?\n\n1159\n00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:19.930\nNow the configuration revision\nis pretty much important.\n\n1160\n00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:21.870\nThis is the password right here.\n\n1161\n00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:28.520\nSo I can set up VTP password and\nthen do sh vtp pass, okay.\n\n1162\n00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.030\nShow VTP password.\n\n1163\n00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.770\nIt should show it to me.\n\n1164\n00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:36.330\nBut anyways, in this case, this right\nhere, there's probably not one set.\n\n1165\n00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:39.010\nBut this is the MD5 Hass,\nso it's got a match and\n\n1166\n00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.218\nthen right here is the revision number.\n\n1167\n00:58:40.218 --> 00:58:44.983\nLet's say I'm a client and I was revision\nnumber 22, and I'm a server here on 21,\n\n1168\n00:58:44.983 --> 00:58:46.495\nthe client will reject it.\n\n1169\n00:58:46.495 --> 00:58:49.910\nAll right,\nit will not accept my VLAN database, okay?\n\n1170\n00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:52.260\nSo enough about VTP [LAUGH].\n\n1171\n00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.640\nI hate to bring it up,\nbut you just never know.\n\n1172\n00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.582\nI want you guys to be prepared.\n\n1173\n00:58:56.582 --> 00:58:59.482\nOkay, Ronnie's gonna summarize and\nlead us out of this section.\n\n1174\n00:58:59.482 --> 00:59:02.030\n>> All right, well,\nin this episode, remember\n\n1175\n00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:06.750\nwhat we actually saw here was just the\nintroduction, and of course, the concepts\n\n1176\n00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:10.990\nto the idea of actually creating VLANs,\nas well as doing interVLAN routing.\n\n1177\n00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:13.716\nRemember that the goal in idea\nof course for VLANs is so\n\n1178\n00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.594\nthat we can take a physical switch and\n\n1179\n00:59:15.594 --> 00:59:19.001\nessentially divide it up logically\ninto the sizes that we need to.\n\n1180\n00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:20.586\nSo that we can configure ports and\n\n1181\n00:59:20.586 --> 00:59:23.813\nactually create more of those little\nbroadcast domains instead and\n\n1182\n00:59:23.813 --> 00:59:26.950\nactually have the network\nwork the way that we want to.\n\n1183\n00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:28.850\nBut on a switch by itself,\n\n1184\n00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:32.530\nit's not gonna actually be able to\ndo routing without a layer 3 device.\n\n1185\n00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:37.484\nSo even if I have VLAN 10 and VLAN 20\non one switch, well, I need a layer-3\n\n1186\n00:59:37.484 --> 00:59:41.560\ndevice in between if I want to route\ntraffic in between those two VLANs.\n\n1187\n00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.160\nAnd Todd demonstrated that\nto us in the configuration\n\n1188\n00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.150\nof what we call route-arm-stick,\nas well as doing it on a layer 3 switch.\n\n1189\n00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:51.750\nAnd then in the end here, he showed us\nin the configuration how we can go and\n\n1190\n00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:55.160\nsetup not only the trunks to make\nsure that everything works, but\n\n1191\n00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.285\nalso to do the interVLAN routing as well.\n\n1192\n00:59:58.285 --> 01:00:02.090\nWell, that's a lot of material for you to\nkind of be able to crunch through, but\n\n1193\n01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.610\nit is stuff that you have to know\nif you're gonna get ready for\n\n1194\n01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:09.990\nthis CCENT exam, so do not hesitate to\ngo back through this a couple of times.\n\n1195\n01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.330\nIf you're not familiar\nwith the concepts here,\n\n1196\n01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:15.970\nmake sure you get familiar with them\nbefore you go and take that exam.\n\n1197\n01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:19.410\nSpeed and accuracy, once again,\nis a key for you, and\n\n1198\n01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:23.150\nyou just trying to figure it out during\nthe exam, you're not gonna have time.\n\n1199\n01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.600\nSo do remember that concept as well,\nand of course,\n\n1200\n01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.200\ncheck out Todd's book that is just freshly\nminted and published out there for him.\n\n1201\n01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.908\nAnd that will, of course, give you\nall the details of some of the things\n\n1202\n01:00:33.908 --> 01:00:35.930\nthat we've seen right here on our show.\n\n1203\n01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:39.740\nWell, that's a great place for us to\ngo and sign off for this episode then.\n\n1204\n01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.570\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n1205\n01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:43.620\n>> And

          "description": "In this episode, Todd Lammle introduces basic routing concepts.  He describes the route forwarding concept and explains how a router does a frame rewrite to forward the data to the next device.  Todd demonstrates how to manually configure routing statically.  This configuration shows us that static routing is unidirectional and administratively intensive with multiple routers but creates routes in the routing table with an Administrative Distance of ‘1’.  He also demonstrates the configuration of a default route which is helpful especially on stub networks—networks in which there is only one way in and one way out of it.",

00:00:16.600\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.920\nAnd today we're continuing\non with some ICND1 content.\n\n5\n00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.810\nWe're getting ready to take that exam,\nand we've got in our studios today, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.070\nTodd Lammie to help guide us through.\n\n7\n00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.400\nTodd, welcome back to our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.940\n>> Fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.530\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.560\nWe're going to jump right into\nthe objectives for IP routing.\n\n11\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.060\nAgain, I don't have to state how important\nthese are, or they wouldn't be here,\n\n12\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.370\nso IP routing.\n\n13\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.510\nNow, gotta remember, what do we take,\nCCNA Security, CCNA Wireless,\n\n14\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.080\nwhat class is this?\n\n15\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.390\n>> This is 1.\n\n16\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080\n>> CCNA Routing Switching was the answer,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.680\n>> Sorry.\n[LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.400\n>> Shot for him.\n\n19\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.190\nGive him a shot.\n\n20\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700\nHe doesn't know we're in a routing and\nswitching class.\n\n21\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.512\nAll right.\n\n22\n00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:51.610\n[LAUGH] So, routing.\n\n23\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.635\nWe're in a routing class.\n\n24\n00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.838\n25% of your exam is routing.\n\n25\n00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:57.030\n25% are switching.\n\n26\n00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.190\nOkay, what's the other 50%?\n\n27\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.695\nTroubleshooting, routing,\nand switching, right?\n\n28\n00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:01.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n29\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.720\nthat's what we gotta hit, guys.\n\n30\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.580\nAnd so, let's go and take a look at\nrouting, how it works, look at some\n\n31\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.330\nrouting tables, configure in our little\ninternet working, little internet work.\n\n32\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.710\nAll right, what is routing?\n\n33\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.040\nRouting is a process.\n\n34\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.120\nThis is a good question, what is routing?\n\n35\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.360\nWhat is IP routing?\n\n36\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.450\nAnd, routing is a process of moving\npackets from one network to another\n\n37\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.250\nnetwork through forwarders.\n\n38\n00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340\nAs a matter of fact, when routers came\nout, they weren't called routers.\n\n39\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.580\nThey were called forwarders.\n\n40\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.385\nThat's how old I am.\n\n41\n00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:29.130\n[LAUGH] Anyways, so, routing,\nwe're gonna move it, what is IPv6 routing?\n\n42\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.760\nIt's the same thing.\n\n43\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.143\nRemember, the definition of IP\nversion 4 is logical addressing and\n\n44\n00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:35.079\nrouting through an internet network.\n\n45\n00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.660\nThe definition of IPv6 has\ngotta be harder, right?\n\n46\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.241\n>> Shouldn't be.\n\n47\n00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:38.750\n>> It's not.\n\n48\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.955\nIt's the same thing.\n\n49\n00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:41.950\nLogical routing to an inner network.\n\n50\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.610\nWe just do it with a longer head and more\nrouter space and a lot more efficiently.\n\n51\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.320\nI can't wait to get to IP Secs,\nI'm very excited about IP Secs.\n\n52\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.480\nAll right, what is routing?\n\n53\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.630\nTo route a router needs to\nknow about remote networks.\n\n54\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.690\nSo basically the router by default we\nneed to understand from looking at this\n\n55\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.790\nIs like, for example,\nrouter a only knows about this network and\n\n56\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.880\nthis network, directly connecting\nnetworks by default, by default.\n\n57\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.560\nSo, we have to tell it either\nwe put them in by hand,\n\n58\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.100\nokay, this is called static routing.\n\n59\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.580\nOr, if we hire someone, and\nthat's called a routing protocol.\n\n60\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.260\nNow, a routing protocol.\n\n61\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.080\nWhat that does, and people are like\nrouting protocol sends data through the,\n\n62\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.190\nno, no, no.\n\n63\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.910\nRouting protocols do one thing and\none thing only.\n\n64\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.960\nThey build maps of your network.\n\n65\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.010\nSo think of you router as a post office,\nand there's a map in there.\n\n66\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.330\nIP comes up cause he's the mail man and\nsays how do I get to this address.\n\n67\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.520\nSo you know looks at the map.\n\n68\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.250\nFigures out, which door to go out off.\n\n69\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.890\nOkay, so someone needs to build that map.\n\n70\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.840\nAnd to make the map the same on\nevery router, which is what we need,\n\n71\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.140\nwe hire someone to build that, and\nthen send that to all other post offices.\n\n72\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.030\nSo all the information is\nthe same in every post office, so\n\n73\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.130\nIP can find the destination, all right?\n\n74\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.450\nNow, so\nwe need to know who our neighbors are.\n\n75\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.780\nSo here's the thing about routing,\nwe need to know who our neighbor is,\n\n76\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.790\nbecause if we're doing IPP routing,\n\n77\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.810\nour job is to pawn off this packet\nto someone else as fast as possible.\n\n78\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.960\nThat's our job.\n\n79\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.200\nRouting this connection from us, so\n\n80\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.560\nwhen we send it to our neighbor, we don't\nsit then and go hey did you get that okay?\n\n81\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.040\nDId it get to where it was supposed to go?\n\n82\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.520\nWe don't know anything about that,\nwe just pawn off on neighbor,\n\n83\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.470\nnow it's their problem I just want it out\nof my router, out of my buffers, boom.\n\n84\n00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.410\nAll right, so we wanna know\nabout all possible routes, so\n\n85\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.100\nwe can make, choose the best path,\nmaybe load bounce.\n\n86\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.720\nAnd now again, we can do this by hand or\nwe can do it with a routing protocol.\n\n87\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.340\nWe're gonna do it by hand at first cuz\nwe have a small network, we can do that.\n\n88\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.800\nWe're gonna find the best route, and\nthen maintain and verify the information.\n\n89\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.590\nSo the difference between us doing it by\nhand and building all the maps by hand in\n\n90\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.270\nevery router is really\nadministrative overhead, okay.\n\n91\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.180\nSo the other thing is you can't do static\nrouting without a good network map.\n\n92\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.680\nSo, I'm gonna have to use CDP, go out my\nnetwork, make sure that it's accurate.\n\n93\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.748\nBecause someone hands it to you, chances\nof it being accurate are probably not,\n\n94\n00:03:57.748 --> 00:03:59.960\nbecause things change.\n\n95\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.130\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna make sure it's accurate.\n\n96\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.140\nAnd then we can do static routing.\n\n97\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.910\nBut if we hire someone, we can just\nturn on the routing protocol like Rick,\n\n98\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.290\ngo out and have a couple beers.\n\n99\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.660\nBecause its job is to find the network,\n\n100\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.710\nI don't even have to have\na network drawing, right?\n\n101\n00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.370\nSo but now, we have overhead on\nthe router and our bandwidth and so on.\n\n102\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.310\nThere's overhead somewhere.\n\n103\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.350\nEither it's on you or\nit's on the router, all right?\n\n104\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.350\nYou choose.\n\n105\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.520\nSo in basic path selection I'm\ngoing to use something called\n\n106\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.370\nthe longest match rule.\n\n107\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.740\nThe longest match rule says ip is\ngoing to look at the routing table and\n\n108\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.277\nfind something closest to\nthis [INAUDIBLE] 32 address.\n\n109\n00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:34.850\nSo if I come in here and I say in\nthis case here look down here guys.\n\n110\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.050\nI am going to come in.\n\n111\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.445\nLet's say it came in here and\n\n112\n00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.827\nI pinged 10.10.10.18 Which\ninterface does it come out.\n\n113\n00:04:41.827 --> 00:04:45.598\nWell, IP is going in and parse the routing\ntable here, and it's gonna look for\n\n114\n00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:46.981\n10.10.10.18.\n\n115\n00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:48.678\nIf it doesn't find that,\nit's gonna look for\n\n116\n00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:51.299\n10.10.10.0 cuz we can have\na co-century in there, right.\n\n117\n00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:53.639\nA /32 host century that's objective,\n\n118\n00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.820\nthey actually listed a host\ninjury as an objective.\n\n119\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.490\nWe typically don't have a lot\nof host injuries, but you can.\n\n120\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.410\nThe idea of a routing table is to know\nhow to get to a street, a network.\n\n121\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.200\nNot necessarily to a house, but\nwe can put a host entry in there.\n\n122\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.385\nAnyway, 10.10.10.18.\n\n123\n00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:11.540\nAnd then if it doesn't find that,\nit's gonna look for 10.10.10.0.\n\n124\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.350\nIf it doesn't find that, it's gonna\nlook for 10.10.10.00, then 10.000.\n\n125\n00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.770\nAnd then what's called\na gateway of last resort,\n\n126\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.660\na 0.0.0.0 which we'll\nconfigure here in a minute.\n\n127\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.800\nAll right, so in this case here,\n\n128\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.920\nit's gonna find the 10.10.10.0, and\nsay I'm gonna go out fast ethernet 0.\n\n129\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.150\nPretty simple process here,\nbeginning here.\n\n130\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.420\nSo in the longest match rules,\ntake a look over here.\n\n131\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.090\nOkay, so I'm consoled into this router and\nI ping, take a look here, 10.1.1.9.\n\n132\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.530\nSo if this is my routing table,\nvery simple example here.\n\n133\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.790\nWhere's 10.1.1.9 here?\n\n134\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.850\nOkay so I'm gonna look down here,\nis there a 10.1.1.9, no, 10.1.1.0 no,\n\n135\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.005\nbut there's a 10.1.0.0 off of E0 isn't\nthere, so I'm gonna exit out E0.\n\n136\n00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:54.510\n10.4.4.4, what do you think Ronnie,\nwhere's that gonna go?\n\n137\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.850\n>> Looks like the E3\n>> No?\n\n138\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.426\nMaybe there's probably a closer match-\n>> I see it.\n\n139\n00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:00.947\nE1.\n\n140\n00:06:00.947 --> 00:06:03.209\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not a very good closer match but yeah,\n\n141\n00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:08.020\nthere's no 10.4.4.4 or even 10.4.4.0 or\n10.4.0.0, there's none of those.\n\n142\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.794\nBut there is a 10.0.0.0 off of E1.\n\n143\n00:06:11.794 --> 00:06:13.454\n10.1.4.7?\n\n144\n00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:15.614\n10.1.4.7?\n\n145\n00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:18.098\nOkay, so we got a pretty good\nmatch there on E2, don't we?\n\n146\n00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:19.038\n10.1.4.7.\n\n147\n00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:19.570\nRight here.\n\n148\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.730\nAnd then the 209 doesn't match anything,\nso\n\n149\n00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.960\nwe're gonna use our gateway of\nlast resort our default route.\n\n150\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.770\nThis is not in there,\nyou have to put it in there by hand.\n\n151\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.930\nYou have to type this in.\n\n152\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.130\nNow, I can have my routing protocol,\nonce I configure it, advertise it and\n\n153\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.090\nwe'll do that.\n\n154\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.490\nBut in this case here, we're gonna use E3.\n\n155\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.500\nNow the other thing you\nguys need to remember,\n\n156\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.110\nthe longest match includes the mask two.\n\n157\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.460\nAnd with class we have the mask in there.\n\n158\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.710\nSo we'd see things like /27 /28\n/29 if something's real close,\n\n159\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.240\nit would use the longest mask as well,\n/29 in that example.\n\n160\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.010\nAnd simple IP routing, guys.\n\n161\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.070\nRouting is kinda simple.\n\n162\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.400\nIt goes hop to hop to hop, and it does the\nsame thing over and over and over again.\n\n163\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.970\nSo if you understand it with one router,\n\n164\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.450\nit doesn't matter if it\ngoes through 100 routers.\n\n165\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.480\nThe process is just the same, it's\njust done 100 times instead of 1 time.\n\n166\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.540\nOkay, so in this case here\nI'm gonna ping 172.16.1.2,\n\n167\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.000\nwhich is this remote host here.\n\n168\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.620\nLet's take a look at host A for a second.\n\n169\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.850\nSo, it's going to ping 1.2,\nwhich is a mode IP address.\n\n170\n00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.861\nSo, the first thing that happen\nis we get a pay load, and\n\n171\n00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.475\nthis is what kind of pay load?\n\n172\n00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:30.000\nICMP.\n\n173\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.500\n>> I see.\n\n174\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.690\n>> ICMP payload, right?\n\n175\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.690\nBecause you use ping.\n\n176\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.920\nIt's a program, works at the network\nlayer and uses the alphabets forwards and\n\n177\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.770\nbackwards.\n\n178\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.730\nAnd if you look at an analyzer in your\nWindows, it only goes A through W,\n\n179\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.390\nwhere everyone else in\nthe world goes A through Z.\n\n180\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.750\nSo go figure.\n\n181\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.690\nAnyway, so I create this payload so\n\n182\n00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.788\nI have two pieces of information,\nand I hand this to IP right.\n\n183\n00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:59.403\nSo this becomes data that I give to IP.\n\n184\n00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:02.428\nNow I hand it the payload Say hey, Mr. IP,\n\n185\n00:08:02.428 --> 00:08:07.720\nsend it to this IP address which is\nthis guy that I got from the program.\n\n186\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.840\nSo now I hand two pieces of information\nto IP, the destination IP address, and\n\n187\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.440\nthe payloads and send it here.\n\n188\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.820\nSo IP now takes that, creates a packet,\nhere's my payload here.\n\n189\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.470\nPuts an IP header in front of it and\nnow it's called a packet or\n\n190\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.180\ndatagram cuz it's from a host.\n\n191\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.720\nNow, in this packet, though,\nthere is the protocol field.\n\n192\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.740\nIf you guys remember, from a couple days\nago, inside the packet is this prototype\n\n193\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.180\nfield, and\nthis defines who owns this packet.\n\n194\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.290\nBecause when I get to the other side,\nI have to know who to hand it to.\n\n195\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.050\nNot really gonna change the IP packet\nuntil I get to the destination, right.\n\n196\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.120\nThere's only one field\nthat changes in there and\n\n197\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.050\nthat's the time to live field every\ntime it goes through a router.\n\n198\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.550\nOther than that,\nthe packet's not really manipulated.\n\n199\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.254\nAll right, so the protocol field said\nin this case here, it's ICMP, so\n\n200\n00:08:58.254 --> 00:08:59.609\nit's gonna say 0x01.\n\n201\n00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:02.535\nSo, when we get to the destination,\nand we say, hey, is ICMP home,\n\n202\n00:09:02.535 --> 00:09:05.900\ncuz this packet is for him, right,\nwhen we get to the destination.\n\n203\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.420\nAll right, so now we have this packet.\n\n204\n00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.060\nNow, IP's gotta make some decisions here.\n\n205\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.950\nSo, IP's sitting there, holding this\npacket in the buffers of this host,\n\n206\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.950\nand says is this a local request?\n\n207\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.620\nDo I just broadcast this out\non the local ethernet network?\n\n208\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.100\nOr is it a remote request and\ndo I send it to default gateway?\n\n209\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.160\nAll right, so it first decides\nthat by comparing the source and\n\n210\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.650\ndestination IP addresses.\n\n211\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.530\nOnce it does that, it then comes and says,\nI need to send this to default gateway,\n\n212\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.810\nlooks in the registry for\nthe default gateway IP address.\n\n213\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.220\nIf it's not configured,\nthen game over, right?\n\n214\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.980\nBut if it is configured, then we have\nthe IP address of the default gateway.\n\n215\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.720\nNow what do we do?\n\n216\n00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.680\nNow we're going to do what guys?\n\n217\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.430\n>> Routing.\n\n218\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.010\n>> Not yet, not yet,\nwe're gonna do ARP aren't we?\n\n219\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.785\nWe're gonna do ARP,\n\n220\n00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:51.470\nbecause I need that destination MAC\naddress of the default gateway.\n\n221\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.760\nAll right, so now that I ARP, well first\nI'm going to look in the ARP cache, right?\n\n222\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.860\nBut Windows only keeps\nit I think nine minutes.\n\n223\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.160\nSo the fact is is that\nit might be in there,\n\n224\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.750\nit might not, typically it probably\npretty much is always in there,\n\n225\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.010\nbut we're gonna then ARP for it, either\nway we're gonna end up with a MAC address.\n\n226\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.256\nNow again we have two pieces of\ninformation, IP has the packet and\n\n227\n00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:12.262\nit has the dash station MAC address, and\n\n228\n00:10:12.262 --> 00:10:16.236\nit hands both of those down to the data\nlink layer, IE the, LAN driver, right?\n\n229\n00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:18.590\nSo the LAN driver now gets this and\ndoes what?\n\n230\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.920\nNow we're going to frame it.\n\n231\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.820\nSo we're gonna take the packet, so\nlet's pretend this is my header,\n\n232\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.950\nmy data link header, this is the packet.\n\n233\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.640\nSo here's my ICMP payload, here's my\npacket which is carrying the ICMP payload.\n\n234\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.900\nAnd then in the frame I\nhave the header source and\n\n235\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.950\ndestination, MAC addresses,\nthe ether type field.\n\n236\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.570\nWhat's the ether type field there?\n\n237\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.090\nThere's an ether type field right here and\nthis is my frame check sequence field,\n\n238\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.730\nwhich carries the answer for the CRC.\n\n239\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.640\nWhat's in that,\nwhat's that ether type field do, guys?\n\n240\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.800\nThat ether type field says,\nwho owns this packet that I'm or\n\n241\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.390\nwho'd I get this packet from, IP?\n\n242\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.528\nWell, the only two answers\ntoday are 0x800 which is IP or\n\n243\n00:10:58.528 --> 00:11:01.466\n0x866 with is IPP6, right.\n\n244\n00:11:01.466 --> 00:11:04.480\nThose are the only two we're\ngonna see typically today.\n\n245\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.670\nNow that being said,\nwe have to know who owns that packet so\n\n246\n00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.700\nwhen this frame gets to\nthat default gateway.\n\n247\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.330\nWe know hey,\nknock knock knock, is IP home?\n\n248\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.290\nI've got a package for him.\n\n249\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.550\nHere's your packet, right?\n\n250\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.080\nAnd then IP can then do the routing,\nright?\n\n251\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.740\nIn this case here, once we build\nthe frame, we have bites of data,\n\n252\n00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.120\nwe're gonna send it down here, and it's\ngonna take those bites in the bits, and\n\n253\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.890\nthen encode them into, in this case\na digital signal cuz we're ethernet, or\n\n254\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.760\nan analog signal, if we're wireless.\n\n255\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.890\nSo we're gonna send it out, it's gonna\ngo through our collision domain,\n\n256\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.996\ngo through our switch,\ngo out the exit port, and end up here.\n\n257\n00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:37.620\nSo the packet that we just created\n\n258\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.330\non that host not manipulated\nat all put inside of a box.\n\n259\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.895\nWe put it into a frame,\nthe source MAC address is here.\n\n260\n00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:50.235\nThe destination MAC address is not here,\nit is not.\n\n261\n00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:53.695\nThis has to be crystal clear to you\nguys before you take your CCNT.\n\n262\n00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:56.005\nWhat is the destination MAC address, okay?\n\n263\n00:11:56.005 --> 00:11:56.835\nIt is here.\n\n264\n00:11:56.835 --> 00:12:00.405\n>> Yep,\nthis is my destination MAC in the frame.\n\n265\n00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:03.130\nSo the frame is transmitted from the PC\n\n266\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.060\nto the gateway through wireless\nethernet through a switch or whatever.\n\n267\n00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.480\nIt gets to that buffers and\nthen what happens?\n\n268\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.480\nThe e0 runs the CRC makes\nsure the frame's okay\n\n269\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.230\nchecks the destination's MAC addresses.\n\n270\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.400\nThis is for me.\n\n271\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.148\nRight looks in the ether type field and\nsays hey there's a package here for\n\n272\n00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.780\nIP all right.\n\n273\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.780\n[LAUGH] So now we're sitting here in\nthe buffers of e0 with the frame,\n\n274\n00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.190\nthe packet's pulled out,\nwhat happens to the frame?\n\n275\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:30.858\nDo we reuse it?\n\n276\n00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:34.810\nWe don't but Cisco has a term in\nthe objectives that I need to bring up,\n\n277\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.290\nit's called Frame Rewrite.\n\n278\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.890\nIt's actually crazy because we're not\nrewriting the frame we're going to create\n\n279\n00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.080\na new one on the other side.\n\n280\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.714\nBut that's their term for Frame Rewrite.\n\n281\n00:12:42.714 --> 00:12:46.875\nSo when we see that what we're talking\nabout is when we package switch this\n\n282\n00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:48.502\nover here to create a new frame,\n\n283\n00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:51.430\nwe have a different source and\ndestination MAC address.\n\n284\n00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.680\nThat being said we're not a very\ngreen network, my friends.\n\n285\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.700\nBecause when we come over here,\n\n286\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.250\nwe have the packet in a box,\nwhat do we do with that box?\n\n287\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.030\nWe don't recycle,\nwe just discard it, right?\n\n288\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.100\nWe throw it away, so\nthat frame is gone forever.\n\n289\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.580\nIt's extremely important that you guys\nunderstand that frames are local,\n\n290\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.285\nMAC addresses are local, and\nnever go through a router.\n\n291\n00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:14.450\nThen IP looks at the packet,\n\n292\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:19.140\nlooks at the destination IP address,\ndetermines that it knows how to get there.\n\n293\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.402\nSo it finds out hey,\ndo I know how to get network 1, right,\n\n294\n00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:24.180\nwe're at network 1.0 here.\n\n295\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.600\n[COUGH] And that's already at e0 so\nwe're gonna package switch it.\n\n296\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.440\nHey, we're layer 3 switch guys really.\n\n297\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.470\nWe're gonna packet switch it to e0 using\nsome sort of packet switching technology.\n\n298\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.228\nAnd then we've got to frame it and\ndo the same thing here.\n\n299\n00:13:35.228 --> 00:13:38.316\nThe source of destination MAC\naddress would be here, and\n\n300\n00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:41.320\nmy destination would be this host here,\nokay?\n\n301\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.720\nSo, we get a new frame, so this is going\nto call this in the new ICND1 objectives,\n\n302\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.086\nframe rewrite, right?\n\n303\n00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:54.130\nSo anyways, the frames are local only,\ndo not go through a router,\n\n304\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.180\nand we have to have a new frame, on every,\nafter we go through every single router.\n\n305\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.710\nThat has to be crystal clear.\n\n306\n00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.340\nSo we can see down here,\nI create my frame.\n\n307\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:08.150\nI click to the router, discard it, route\nthe packet out to the exit interface, and\n\n308\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.009\nthen create a new frame.\n\n309\n00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.150\nNow, just to test your understanding here.\n\n310\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.660\nHost A here is gonna web\nbrowse to the HTTP server.\n\n311\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.650\nSo Ronnie, based on this one here, what do\nyou think the destination MAC address when\n\n312\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.070\nit leaves Host A says the destination\naddress of a frame will be, what?\n\n313\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.250\nBecause I'm trying to get over,\nso what would be the HTTP Server?\n\n314\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.321\n>> No,\nit should be the interface on Lab A, E0.\n\n315\n00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:36.945\n>> Not as easy to read, but\nwhatever that interface on that router is,\n\n316\n00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:38.800\nit has to be something on my local.\n\n317\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.790\nMy MAC addresses have to\nbe on my local network,\n\n318\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.670\ncan't be on the other side of the router,\nright?\n\n319\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.260\nWe have to understand this, right?\n\n320\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.310\nAnd then we'll have another one here\nsource here and destination frame here.\n\n321\n00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.250\nThis must be crystal clear.\n\n322\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.590\nThe other thing is the destination IP\naddress, though, that never changes.\n\n323\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.290\nThat's gonna be my destination.\n\n324\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.825\nThe neck of the unicast\naddress of this server, right?\n\n325\n00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:03.149\nThe destination port number in\na segment header, cuz we're using HTTP,\n\n326\n00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:04.338\nwill have a value of what?\n\n327\n00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:06.962\n>> 80.\n\n328\n00:15:06.962 --> 00:15:07.621\n>> Yeah, 80.\n\n329\n00:15:07.621 --> 00:15:09.618\nWhat is it if we were using HTTPS?\n\n330\n00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:10.662\n>> 443.\n\n331\n00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:12.714\n>> Let's test Ronnie here for\na second, guys.\n\n332\n00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:14.014\nWhat about Telnet?\n\n333\n00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:14.887\n>> 23.\n\n334\n00:15:14.887 --> 00:15:16.684\n>> 23.\n\n335\n00:15:16.684 --> 00:15:17.891\nFTP.\n\n336\n00:15:17.891 --> 00:15:20.012\n>> 21.\n\n337\n00:15:20.012 --> 00:15:21.406\n>> There you go.\n\n338\n00:15:21.406 --> 00:15:23.078\nNetwork News Transport Protocol.\n\n339\n00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:24.132\n>> 119.\n>> I'm just screwing with you.\n\n340\n00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:24.804\nHe knows it.\n\n341\n00:15:24.804 --> 00:15:27.863\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Wow, he needs to do a shot for\n\n342\n00:15:27.863 --> 00:15:29.520\nthat one cuz that was like a score.\n\n343\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.580\n>> No, no,\nyou should do a shot for that one.\n\n344\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.368\n>> That was actually a question\non the exam like 10 years,\n\n345\n00:15:33.368 --> 00:15:35.120\n20 years ago on the CCNA.\n\n346\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.032\nNot gonna ask that anymore because\nyou're gonna block that port.\n\n347\n00:15:37.032 --> 00:15:38.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n348\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.355\n119, everyone blocks that port.\n\n349\n00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:41.818\nTFTP?\n\n350\n00:15:41.818 --> 00:15:44.488\n>> 63?\n\n351\n00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:45.347\n>> 69.\n\n352\n00:15:45.347 --> 00:15:46.563\n>> 9.\n\n353\n00:15:46.563 --> 00:15:48.490\n>> No one in IT ever forgets that one.\n\n354\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.500\nAll right, basic routing question,\nshow IP route.\n\n355\n00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.720\n>> Right, so I'm seeing this.\n\n356\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.301\nWe'll look through a routing\ntable in more detail guys but\n\n357\n00:15:57.301 --> 00:15:59.837\nI want to take a look here,\nthis are directly connected.\n\n358\n00:15:59.837 --> 00:16:03.573\nHere's my RIP injected routes, again we're\ngonna get through this in this section.\n\n359\n00:16:03.573 --> 00:16:05.908\nWe're gonna look closer in to\na routing table and dissect it.\n\n360\n00:16:05.908 --> 00:16:10.450\nBut in this case here,\nCorp router receives an IP packet with\n\n361\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.750\na source IP of 214.20 and\na destination 22.3.\n\n362\n00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.370\nWhat would this router do with\nthis is a good question, alright?\n\n363\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.820\nBecause I want you to understand\nwhat's gonna happen here.\n\n364\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.240\nI'm gonna make my screen\na little big here.\n\n365\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.050\nTake a look so,\nwhere did the source packet come in?\n\n366\n00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.190\nThat's what you've got\nto start with first.\n\n367\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.130\nI'm going to look down here for 214.\n\n368\n00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.450\nNotice we have some clarity of order here.\n\n369\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.650\n214's right here.\n\n370\n00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.290\nIt came in FastEthernet0/0.\n\n371\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.340\nThat's the first thing\nyou guys need to check.\n\n372\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.150\nNow we're going to find out\nwhere it's going to go out, and\n\n373\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.070\nwe're going to look for 22.3.\n\n374\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.520\nSo 22,\nnotice they put them in a nice order here.\n\n375\n00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.050\nThat's not always the case.\n\n376\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.690\nIn this case here I don't see 22, do you?\n\n377\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.670\nSo what does a router do?\n\n378\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.970\nDoes it broadcast out all\nthe reports to try to find that?\n\n379\n00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.730\nIt doesn't, a router will discard this.\n\n380\n00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.380\nIf it's not there, router is like,\nyou're out of here, gone,\n\n381\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.700\nit's not in my routing table.\n\n382\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.210\nIt has to be in my map.\n\n383\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.720\nRight, so if that's the case,\nwhat's it gonna do?\n\n384\n00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.500\nJust discard it and move on.\n\n385\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.740\nWell, it's gonna discard it and move on,\nbut it's gonna do something else as well.\n\n386\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.580\nIt's going to send what?\n\n387\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:24.740\nAn ICMP Destination Unreachable\nmessage back out FastEthernet0/0.\n\n388\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.160\nICMP Destination Unreachable message,\nthose are what you get on your host.\n\n389\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.660\nCan't get there from here, right?\n\n390\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.820\nAll right, on your host,\nyou can't get there.\n\n391\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.830\nNow on static routes, coming back here,\nyou gotta remember that\n\n392\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.670\njust because you can get somewhere,\ndoesn't mean you can get back, all right?\n\n393\n00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.240\nSo in this case here,\nlet's take a look, and\n\n394\n00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.910\nto do static routing,\nyou have to have a good network map.\n\n395\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.380\nI have a good network map,\nI only have two routers, right?\n\n396\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.250\nWell, basically three, but\nI wanna Define Stub Networking here.\n\n397\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.540\nOkay, it's important for\nyou to understand this.\n\n398\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.480\nA Stub Network, check this out.\n\n399\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.780\nis a network that only has one way in or\nout, doesn't it?\n\n400\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.470\nSo if I'm these hosts here I really\ncan't go anywhere but to router B.\n\n401\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.030\nThis makes my configuration\nof routing pretty simply.\n\n402\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.370\nRight, we'll take a look at that.\n\n403\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:16.010\nOkay, so router A is directly connected\nto network two and to network three,\n\n404\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.870\n172.16.3, we'll keep it simple.\n\n405\n00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.550\nWe see that it's directly connected\nto networks two and three.\n\n406\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.174\nAll right, so in this case here,\n\n407\n00:18:23.174 --> 00:18:25.959\nrouter A can ping router B\nthey're directly connected.\n\n408\n00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:28.360\nAnd during it,\nwe haven't done any routing yet.\n\n409\n00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.380\nBut if I was to do routing, and send it\nover to B, router BS to be configured,\n\n410\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.140\nto be able to send data back,\nso remember that.\n\n411\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.800\nLet's take a look at some\nadvantages of static routing.\n\n412\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.120\nIt reduces load when used\nwhen stub network links.\n\n413\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.510\nWe're gonna find out why that is\nby doing a default route here,\n\n414\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.760\nbecause it's a stub network, only one-way\nin or out, we can take advantage of that.\n\n415\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.500\nSecurity increases, true, because I can\nonly put in things in the routing table\n\n416\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.030\nthat I want people to get to.\n\n417\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:57.740\nRight, so if I'm my job is to say here's\nevery network that I've found and\n\n418\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.020\nputs it in the routing table by default.\n\n419\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.600\nThat's their job.\n\n420\n00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.742\nHey they help you get to every network.\n\n421\n00:19:01.742 --> 00:19:04.780\nAll right, that might not be what you\nwant so static routes might be there.\n\n422\n00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.260\nLet's take a look at this for a second.\n\n423\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.350\nStatic routes here on a.\n\n424\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.500\nIt's pretty simple I don't\nhave a config here so\n\n425\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.580\nwe'd have to start with a config t.\n\n426\n00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.070\nPretty simple.\n\n427\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.380\nStatic routing is extremely simple\nif you have an accurate map.\n\n428\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.260\nIf you don't have an accurate map,\nyou're in for a really long, painful day.\n\n429\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.810\nAll right,\nI'm directly connected to one and two.\n\n430\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.370\nI'm only not directly connected, and\nwhat we need to think about, Is,\n\n431\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.510\nwhen you're doing static routing\nwhat am I not directly connected to?\n\n432\n00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.430\nWhat do I have to put in here?\n\n433\n00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.420\nWe think completely opposite when\nwe get to the dynamic routing.\n\n434\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.740\nWe'll see in a second.\n\n435\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.130\nIn router A,\nI'm not directly connected to one so\n\n436\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.370\nI have to put in a route\nthat gets me to network one.\n\n437\n00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.090\nAnd I'm just gonna pawn\noff of my neighbor.\n\n438\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.290\nSo someone sends me this, I'm like\nhere Bob it's your problem not mine.\n\n439\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.890\nTo get to network I say IP route,\nthis is my remote network.\n\n440\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.240\nThis is my remote mask.\n\n441\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.700\nOkay, I want you to\nunderstand this foundation.\n\n442\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.400\nYou have to know your foundation so\nyou can take out the wrong answers.\n\n443\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.220\nThis is the remote network\nthat uses this remote mask.\n\n444\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.130\nAnd at this point,\nthis is my next hub, gateway.\n\n445\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.100\nThat's my neighbor who\nI'm pawning it off on.\n\n446\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.610\nMake it their problem, not yours.\n\n447\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.320\nNow, probably a better way to do something\nlike this, on a point-to-point link,\n\n448\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.150\nyou really, probably, you can do this on\na multi-point link, on a fast Ethernet,\n\n449\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.430\non a LAN, and say, hey,\nthere's a router out there somewhere, and\n\n450\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.030\npush it out my exit interface,\nlike fast Ethernet 0/0.\n\n451\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.440\nBut it causes a lot of ARP traffic, so\nI probably wouldn't use exit interface.\n\n452\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.140\nOn a LAN interface, right,\non a multi access broadcast network.\n\n453\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.240\nYou can, it just causes a lot of overhead.\n\n454\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.120\nAll right, ip route to get to network\none remote network using this mask.\n\n455\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.520\nSending out my directly\nconnected interface s0 right.\n\n456\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.340\nAnd I don't have to worry about.\n\n457\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.200\nThis is extremely helpful we'll see\ntoday or tomorrow, when we get to IPv6.\n\n458\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.670\nNow, in this case here,\nI'm gonna type in s0 here.\n\n459\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.030\nNow, is there a difference\nbetween these two commands?\n\n460\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.100\nNot really,\nbecause the result is exactly the same.\n\n461\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.110\nHowever, they show up different\nin the routing table.\n\n462\n00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.710\nThis one shows up with an S,\nas a static route.\n\n463\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.860\nThis one shows up directly connected\nbecause basically we're saying\n\n464\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.770\nNetwork one is this interface, right?\n\n465\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.030\nSo it actually shows up\nas directly connected.\n\n466\n00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.010\nBut other than that,\nthey function exactly the same.\n\n467\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.950\nAm I done with routing on this router?\n\n468\n00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.910\nKind of, I mean it depends.\n\n469\n00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.950\nI mean if there was something up here that\nI needed to get to I wouldn't be, but for\n\n470\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.700\nthis example I am.\n\n471\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.780\nNow, Jose pings this post over here,\n\n472\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.880\nright, router A gets it, and says,\nI know how to get to network 1 now, I'm so\n\n473\n00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.180\nexcited I'm gonna punt it\noff on my buddy over here.\n\n474\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.660\nRouter B gets it and says,\nnetwork 1, I know how to get there.\n\n475\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.700\nSends you to the host.\n\n476\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.950\nHost says, this is where destined for\nnetwork 2, that's a remote network, so\n\n477\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.500\nI'm gonna send it to my default gateway.\n\n478\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.050\nEverybody goes, never heard of a discard.\n\n479\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.470\nJust cuz you can get there,\ndoesn't mean you can get back.\n\n480\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.920\nDefinitely got there.\n\n481\n00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.340\nWhere router b got and said, don't know\nhow to get to network two, discard, okay?\n\n482\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:44.900\nSo let's fix that.\n\n483\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.110\nSo first, I wanna take a look at router a.\n\n484\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:54.290\nSo here's router a, show IP route\nis how I see my routing tables.\n\n485\n00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.300\nShow IPv6 route, show IP route is my IP 4.\n\n486\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.870\nThese codes will tell you,\nhey it's a local host.\n\n487\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.420\nDirectly connected, static, RIP.\n\n488\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.310\nWe've got EIGRP, D stands for dual.\n\n489\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.660\nYou got BGP, OSPF,\ndifferent types of OSPF, and so on.\n\n490\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.570\nSo you have all your codes here, and\nthere's actually a lot of them, right?\n\n491\n00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.300\nSo let's take a look,\n\n492\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.160\ncuz when we got to 15 code it\nshowed up a little bit different.\n\n493\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.430\nC stands for directly connected.\n\n494\n00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:26.010\nSo I can see 172, 16, two zeros directly\nconnected off of fast ethernet 00, okay?\n\n495\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.620\nAnd we have what's considered in sub nets,\nit says hey, 172.16 is sub netted.\n\n496\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:35.510\nHere's my different sub nets,\nI've got one zero and three zero one now.\n\n497\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.500\nThere's my status I just put in, right?\n\n498\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.930\nSo 172.16.1.0 to get there Now,\nthis is the administrative distance.\n\n499\n00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.340\nWe're gonna talk about that in a minute.\n\n500\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.910\nThis is it's trustworthiness.\n\n501\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.710\nLet me tell you something.\n\n502\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.850\nOne is a high trustworthiness rating.\n\n503\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:49.870\nYou probably wanna change that.\n\n504\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.450\nWe're gonna come back to that subject.\n\n505\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.300\nAdministrative distance, it's important.\n\n506\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.360\nBut, this tells me hey,\npawn it off on my neighbor, 172.16.3.2.\n\n507\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.490\nThat means hey, if you get something for\nnetwork one, not my problem, it's theirs.\n\n508\n00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.250\nC, again, network 3 is C.\n\n509\n00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.440\nNow we have this L here, this is the link.\n\n510\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.150\nThis is the actual\naddress of the interface.\n\n511\n00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.810\nNotice this /32,\nit's actually a host address.\n\n512\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.050\nThis is the actual IP\naddress of your interface.\n\n513\n00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.130\nNow these were here before, they just\ndidn't show up in the routing table.\n\n514\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.650\nWhen something came in for your router,\nit had to RP for this address and get it.\n\n515\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.570\nIt knew about it, and if you did\na show IP-RP to actually see it, but\n\n516\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.970\nit wasn't in the routing table.\n\n517\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.830\nThis made it a little more efficient,\nI guess.\n\n518\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.270\nHarder for us to maybe read but\nnonetheless, so your interfaces show up\n\n519\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:33.040\nas an l starting in the 15 code,\nright, so it's gonna help us.\n\n520\n00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.300\nSo now let's go to router b and\n\n521\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.910\nbecause we knew we could get there,\nwe just couldn't get back.\n\n522\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.330\nSo I say default route router b.\n\n523\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:50.333\nNow I notice this IP route any network,\nany remote mask.\n\n524\n00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:50.950\nThese are any remote network,\nany remote mask.\n\n525\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.274\nPawned off on my neighbor 3.1.\n\n526\n00:23:52.274 --> 00:23:55.114\nOn a point-to-point link though,\n\n527\n00:23:55.114 --> 00:24:00.439\nI could easily just type in X\ninterface s0/0/0/1 here right.\n\n528\n00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.797\nSo X interface is fine on a point to\npoint link I have no problem there right.\n\n529\n00:24:04.797 --> 00:24:07.434\nSo we'd have a default\nroute that goes back here.\n\n530\n00:24:07.434 --> 00:24:11.278\nSo now when this guy comes here You get\nto b, b comes over here, he comes back,\n\n531\n00:24:11.278 --> 00:24:12.120\ncan we get back?\n\n532\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.920\nAnd now we're gonna send it back to a.\n\n533\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.990\nThe reason we do this is, this is probably\nmy connection to the internet, so\n\n534\n00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.850\nwe're gonna pawn it off here.\n\n535\n00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.840\nWe'll have a default\nroute that goes this way.\n\n536\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.690\nAnd then instead of putting\nin all the static routes\n\n537\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.040\nto get out on the stub network,\nthis is a very efficient way to do it.\n\n538\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.030\nLet's take a look at how it\nlooks in the routing table.\n\n539\n00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.000\nBecause I put in the next\nhop it shows up as an s.\n\n540\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.620\nAgain, if I had to put in the x\ninterface it would have showed up as\n\n541\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.580\ndirectly connected, no big deal.\n\n542\n00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.240\nStatic route, administrative distance\nmeans I trust this very much.\n\n543\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.142\nAny network, and then up here, once I put\nthis in the astrig it's a static route,\n\n544\n00:24:45.142 --> 00:24:49.638\nit's a candidate for a gateway of last\nresort is what it says to the astrig.\n\n545\n00:24:49.638 --> 00:24:53.760\nBut notice that, to get to any network.\n\n546\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.850\nSo now my gateway of last resort is set,\nvia 3.1.\n\n547\n00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.590\nDefault route example.\n\n548\n00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.280\nSo, in this case here,\nI'm gonna pawn off everything to this guy.\n\n549\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.360\nI'm gonna use either the x\ninterface here or the next hop.\n\n550\n00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.000\nOn something like this, if you can,\n\n551\n00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.280\nprobably use your x interface, it's\npossible with RSP, if you have DSL cable,\n\n552\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.250\nyou're using PPEOE or something like that,\nyour IP address could change.\n\n553\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.450\nIt's possible.\n\n554\n00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.706\nUsing the rx interface might make\nit easier for you, it's up to you.\n\n555\n00:25:23.706 --> 00:25:28.450\nNow if I wanna advertise, let's say I\nhave a bunch of routers over here and\n\n556\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.410\nI want them to know hey I'm the way out.\n\n557\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.310\nI'm the way out of my tunnel system or\nwhatever and\n\n558\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.600\nI'm gonna get you the Internet.\n\n559\n00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.720\nSo instead of going to all those\nrouters and funneling everything back,\n\n560\n00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.750\nI'm just going to put this under RIP and\n\n561\n00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.140\nhave it advertised that hey\nI'm the default route out.\n\n562\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.770\nNow I'm going to use this with OSPF today,\nno, probably tomorrow.\n\n563\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.750\nDefault information originate says hey the\ndefault information originates here, and\n\n564\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.915\nI'm gonna advertise it\nwith my routing protocol.\n\n565\n00:25:52.915 --> 00:25:57.272\nIt's a nice way to do it\nif you don't do [LAUGH].\n\n566\n00:25:57.272 --> 00:26:00.068\nMy software update, awesome.\n\n567\n00:26:00.068 --> 00:26:03.195\nOkay [LAUGH] don't do this, now.\n\n568\n00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:04.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love that.\n\n569\n00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.580\nOkay, if you don't make\na mistake like this.\n\n570\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.765\nMy iPad wants to update on me.\n\n571\n00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:12.885\n[COUGH] It's gonna wait to the last screen\nand then it's gonna reboot or something.\n\n572\n00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:15.942\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways, router B, we have here,\n\n573\n00:26:15.942 --> 00:26:19.414\n172.16.0.0, send it to 3.1.\n\n574\n00:26:19.414 --> 00:26:21.010\nAll right, just gonna pawn it off here.\n\n575\n00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.930\nBut a had the wrong thing, it sent\nout default information originally.\n\n576\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.210\nIt says hey, I've got the default route,\nit inserted in here, or we typed it in,\n\n577\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:31.860\neither way, but nonetheless,\nrouter a sends it back here.\n\n578\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.950\nSo I've seen this in networks and\n\n579\n00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.390\nthe reason I put this in here is\na very common issue, it's easy to do.\n\n580\n00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.895\nSo you wanna be very careful here because\nthis doesn't mean your network is\n\n581\n00:26:39.895 --> 00:26:40.520\nnot gonna work.\n\n582\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.430\nIt actually does go like this and\n\n583\n00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.970\nthey're eventually gonna spit\nsome stuff out sometimes.\n\n584\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.550\nAnd so that's a network loop and\neverything just goes really slow.\n\n585\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.600\nGood luck finding this\nin a larger enterprise.\n\n586\n00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.130\nIt's pretty tough.\n\n587\n00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.700\nNow before we can do static routing,\nyou want to verify your networks.\n\n588\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.750\nBefore I do dynamic routing,\nI need to verify my networks,\n\n589\n00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.130\nI just have to do them differently.\n\n590\n00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.160\nTo do static routing I have to have what?\n\n591\n00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.700\nA very good network map.\n\n592\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.570\nIf I don't, sit down and\nstart drawing it out.\n\n593\n00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.060\nThat's pretty much what you're\ngonna have to do all the time.\n\n594\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.780\nSo when we're configuring static routes,\n\n595\n00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.598\nwe never type in our\ndirectly connected network.\n\n596\n00:27:11.598 --> 00:27:14.170\nSo I'm gonna verify,\nwhat am I directly connected to,\n\n597\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:18.130\nwhat am I not directly connected to, so\nI know what to type in for static routing.\n\n598\n00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.275\nWhen we get to dynamic routing,\nit's the complete opposite.\n\n599\n00:27:20.275 --> 00:27:23.010\nI find out what I'm directly connected\nto and that's all I care about, and\n\n600\n00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.800\nI just put that in my routing protocol.\n\n601\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.030\nIt's the routing protocol's job\nto go find those remote networks.\n\n602\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.880\nSo with static routing,\nit's my job to find those and\n\n603\n00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.290\nput those in the routing table.\n\n604\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.710\nOkay so, show IP or\n\n605\n00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.470\nshow IP route connected is a great way to\nsee what you're directly connected to.\n\n606\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.760\nSo I know if I'm doing static routing,\ndon't type these in.\n\n607\n00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.720\nRouting can get confused\nif I type in static routes.\n\n608\n00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.480\nAll right, show IP interface brief is\nalso a good way to see what I'm directly\n\n609\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.440\nconnected to.\n\n610\n00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.880\nYou know, some show IP protocols, or\nshow protocols, show run, whatever.\n\n611\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.110\nAll right, so looking at my network map,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n612\n00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.620\nconfigure, well actually yeah,\nwe can configure static routing now.\n\n613\n00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.450\nLet's do some static routing, woohoo.\n\n614\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.844\nNow, so\nlet's take a look at my network drawing.\n\n615\n00:28:09.872 --> 00:28:11.440\nActually let me come back here.\n\n616\n00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:18.721\nBecause I am on the corp router,\nso I'm directly connected to this.\n\n617\n00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:22.239\n172.16.10.4 sub net,\n\n618\n00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:27.000\n172.16.10.0 sub net, and\nthen 10.10.10 network.\n\n619\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.180\nSo if I'm doing static routing,\n\n620\n00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.990\nI'm not gonna type those in,\nthose three networks, on the Corp router.\n\n621\n00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:40.802\nAnd then up here, I'm directly connected\nto the 172.16.4 and 192.168.20,\n\n622\n00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:44.850\nso what does Corp need to know to get to,\nand I have these loopbacks overset.\n\n623\n00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.040\nThis guy's to 30, and\nover here, this guy's to 40.\n\n624\n00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.500\nThis gives us some extra\nnetworks over here.\n\n625\n00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:56.012\nSo [COUGH] Corp is not correctly\nconnected to what, four networks.\n\n626\n00:28:56.012 --> 00:29:00.140\n192, 168, 10, 20, 30,\nand 40, pretty simple.\n\n627\n00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.800\nI can't type that in as 192.168.0.0,\nI probably could but I'm not going to.\n\n628\n00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.530\nYou might get yourself in some trouble\nwith that if you're not careful.\n\n629\n00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.080\nSo, let's go to Corp and\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n630\n00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.510\nAnd then I can put a default\nroute on here I think,\n\n631\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.280\nout to F00 [LAUGH] 10.10.10.1\nsomething like that.\n\n632\n00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.280\nAnd then advertise that if I wanted to.\n\n633\n00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.728\nOkay, f config t.\n\n634\n00:29:27.124 --> 00:29:32.750\nOkay I'm not directly connected\nto 192.168.10.020, 30, and 40.\n\n635\n00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:37.220\nSo I probably could do a broad\nstatement there but in this case here,\n\n636\n00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.770\nsince I go in two different directions,\nI certainly don't wanna do that.\n\n637\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.450\nAll right, so first thing I'm gonna do,\n\n638\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.520\nip route 0.0.0.0, nope,\ndon't wanna do that.\n\n639\n00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.638\nHow about 192.168.10.0?\n\n640\n00:29:51.638 --> 00:29:54.454\nOkay, let me try this again.\n\n641\n00:29:54.454 --> 00:29:57.734\nThere we go.\n\n642\n00:29:57.734 --> 00:30:00.880\n192.168.10.0 with this remote mask.\n\n643\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.580\nIn this case here, we're talking\nabout point-to-point link, so\n\n644\n00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.080\nI'm gonna do them both ways so\nI can show it to you.\n\n645\n00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:14.613\nSo the next hop is\n172.16.10.2 to get to 10.0.\n\n646\n00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:19.150\nI typed in 10.1, it came back,\ncan't do that that, that's me.\n\n647\n00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.290\nI'm glad it did that cuz I would\nhave just made that error.\n\n648\n00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.020\nDo you see how easy it is to make\nan error on the exam if you were doing\n\n649\n00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.690\nsomething like this and\nthen you think I'm aceing this exam.\n\n650\n00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.780\nWell I just made a typo,\nso just be very aware.\n\n651\n00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.001\nThe next one to get to network,\nI think over there, let me take a look,\n\n652\n00:30:35.001 --> 00:30:41.316\nis 40 off of network San Francisco or\nrouter San Francisco 40.0, 225.225.225.0.\n\n653\n00:30:41.316 --> 00:30:43.828\nAnd I'm gonna send this out,\ncheck this out.\n\n654\n00:30:43.828 --> 00:30:47.453\nMy x interface, are both of these the same\nthing and gonna accomplish the same thing?\n\n655\n00:30:47.453 --> 00:30:48.270\nSure they are.\n\n656\n00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.170\nThat's the second time I had a typo.\n\n657\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.700\nThank you mister router for fixing me.\n\n658\n00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.070\n[LAUGH] So now,\nCorp router can get to network 10.\n\n659\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.120\nCorp router should be able\nto get to network 40.\n\n660\n00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.920\nBut just because I can get there\ndoesn't mean I can get back.\n\n661\n00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.937\nSo let's go to San Francisco.\n\n662\n00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.031\nIP route,\nyou know what we didn't check is,\n\n663\n00:31:29.031 --> 00:31:33.890\nwhat is San Francisco\ndirectly connected to?\n\n664\n00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.080\nSo let's do this,\nI want you guys to do this.\n\n665\n00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.130\nShow ip int brief.\n\n666\n00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.477\nSo I can see I'm directly\nconnected to 192.168.40,\n\n667\n00:31:44.477 --> 00:31:48.750\n172.16, and 192.168.10, that's fine.\n\n668\n00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.720\nSo by looking at my drawing though,\nlet's come back over here.\n\n669\n00:31:53.646 --> 00:31:54.704\nOut here.\n\n670\n00:31:57.433 --> 00:32:00.883\nSan Francisco is directly\nconnected to 40 and 10,\n\n671\n00:32:00.883 --> 00:32:03.287\nwhat is it not directly connected to?\n\n672\n00:32:03.287 --> 00:32:09.159\n10.10.10, 110.216.10.4 and 102.68.30.0.\n\n673\n00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:12.572\nI tell you what though,\nthis seems like an awful lot of work.\n\n674\n00:32:12.572 --> 00:32:14.887\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do you think there's a way I could do\n\n675\n00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:16.490\nthis with doing a heck of a lot less work?\n\n676\n00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.650\nBecause I'm really into that, right?\n\n677\n00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:19.480\nWhat do you think Ronnie?\n\n678\n00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.170\nWhat do we think that this is up here?\n\n679\n00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:22.010\nWhat is this?\n\n680\n00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.250\nI'm going to think that\nthis is a stub network.\n\n681\n00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.810\nWhy don't I just make this easy on myself,\nright?\n\n682\n00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.250\nI like that idea Todd, do it.\n\n683\n00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.839\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n684\n00:32:33.862 --> 00:32:34.717\nWhoops.\n\n685\n00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:38.289\nSo can I just do this?\n\n686\n00:32:42.352 --> 00:32:44.980\nAnd this is gonna take me to everything.\n\n687\n00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.758\nAnd I'm directly connected,\nnot on a broadcast network, on a serial.\n\n688\n00:32:49.758 --> 00:32:52.548\nSo I can just use my exit interface or\nI could use but\n\n689\n00:32:52.548 --> 00:32:54.030\nin this case I'm just my exit.\n\n690\n00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.510\nWill this work?\n\n691\n00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.040\n>> Should.\n\n692\n00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.500\n>> Should, I like his optimism here.\n\n693\n00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.040\n>> I couldn't see it.\n\n694\n00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.810\n>> Trying to help here, buddy.\n\n695\n00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.989\nAll right, so let's see if I\ncan get there from the corp.\n\n696\n00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.850\nAll right, so the first thing I'm\ngonna do is show IP route and\n\n697\n00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:11.750\ncheck my routing table.\n\n698\n00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.480\nOkay, there is my to get to 10 network,\n172.16.10 network /3 is directly\n\n699\n00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.130\nconnected because remember,\nthat's my subnet on my serial link.\n\n700\n00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:28.010\nThese are, that's my link, 10.1,\nhere's 10.4 off of serial 0/1/0 and\n\n701\n00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.590\nthen we've got 192.168.10.0 is a static,\nright?\n\n702\n00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:38.720\nAnd then with administrative distance\nof 1, via 10.2, and then 40 though,\n\n703\n00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.550\nnotice shows up as directly connected\noff of serial 0/0/0, right?\n\n704\n00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.280\nI typed in the same command, one with\na next hop, one with an x interface.\n\n705\n00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.880\nSo let's ping 192.68.40.1,\nthis has to assume that I can get back.\n\n706\n00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.920\nJust so I can get there,\nI have to be able to get back.\n\n707\n00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.100\nThen I'll change this to 10.1, nice.\n\n708\n00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.530\nThe other thing I've got to\ndo is come up here to LA.\n\n709\n00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.080\nThree routers, taking a couple minutes.\n\n710\n00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.730\nIf you had a much bigger network,\nthis would be relatively difficult.\n\n711\n00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.010\nAll right, and\nreally easy to make mistakes that way.\n\n712\n00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.550\nSo, I'm going to say config t, and\nI don't really need to see the network map\n\n713\n00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:22.870\nbecause I'm just going to do another\ndefault route on the stub network.\n\n714\n00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.260\nIP route, 0.000000.\n\n715\n00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.911\nAnd then to x-interface so 1/0.\n\n716\n00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:30.970\nAll right, make it easy on myself.\n\n717\n00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.410\nNow, these kept my\nadministrator distances as one.\n\n718\n00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.980\nSo I'm gonna talk about that in a minute,\nbut\n\n719\n00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.880\nnow that we've got this done I should\nbe able to ping LA's, come on.\n\n720\n00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.970\nSo now we'll come back up here,\nping 192.168, I think whoops,\n\n721\n00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:57.040\nping 192.169.20.1, whoops,\nand did I put in a route to.\n\n722\n00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.105\nI didn't put a route on\nmy corporate router.\n\n723\n00:34:59.105 --> 00:34:59.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Again,\n\n724\n00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.470\nso now we gotta do more work here.\n\n725\n00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.670\nI gotta tell the corp router how to get\nthere, but watch what I'm gonna do here.\n\n726\n00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:09.370\nSo I'm gonna say configt, So\n\n727\n00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.500\nI can get back,\nI just couldn't get there to begin with.\n\n728\n00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.487\nConfigt, ip route 192.168.20.0,\n\n729\n00:35:19.342 --> 00:35:26.550\nUsing this mask, now,\nI can send it out 0/1/0 my x interface.\n\n730\n00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.740\nAnd check this out.\n\n731\n00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:33.140\nMy administrative distance by default\nis 1, which is very trustworthy.\n\n732\n00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.640\nI don't want this route\nto be that trustworthy.\n\n733\n00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.170\nI'm gonna change it by\nputting a number at the end.\n\n734\n00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.890\nI'm changing my administrative distance,\nright?\n\n735\n00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.970\nImportant objective here because\nI definitely use static routes in\n\n736\n00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.140\nmy customers and I do this,\ncalled a floating static route.\n\n737\n00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.430\nSo I raise the Administrative distance\nhigher than any routing protocol.\n\n738\n00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:54.090\nThat means this route won't be used\nunless those routing protocols go away.\n\n739\n00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.690\nSo I use this for, say,\ndisaster recovery links.\n\n740\n00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:57.580\nThings like that.\n\n741\n00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.670\nA floating static route.\n\n742\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.570\nThat's what it's called.\n\n743\n00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.720\nSo I just raise the administrative\ndistance of that route, and\n\n744\n00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.620\nsaid it's not that trustworthy.\n\n745\n00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.970\nUse it last okay?\n\n746\n00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.760\nSo we need another route,\nwhere are we going?\n\n747\n00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.800\n30, so I'm gonna use the same thing,\n\n748\n00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.350\nI'm just gonna up arrow,\nchange this to 30 done and done.\n\n749\n00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:23.273\nPretty simple guys and\npinging 192.168.20.1 and\n\n750\n00:36:23.273 --> 00:36:27.930\nping 30.1 and\nI hope that works up and running.\n\n751\n00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.140\nAnd again, guys, very simple process.\n\n752\n00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.460\nVery, very easy.\n\n753\n00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.260\nWe did default routes on our stubs,\nput in four static routes for\n\n754\n00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.070\nthe four routers we weren't connected to.\n\n755\n00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.560\nI couldn't have done this\nwithout a good network map.\n\n756\n00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.620\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at something else.\n\n757\n00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.890\nJust a couple of more minutes here.\n\n758\n00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.650\nActually, why don't we stop here and we'll\ncome back because we're gonna do dynamic\n\n759\n00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.140\nrouting and\nthat's gonna take a few more minutes.\n\n760\n00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.320\n>> All right, well in this episode,\n\n761\n00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.970\nremember what we took a look at here,\nright.\n\n762\n00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.670\nIs the basics of IP routing,\n\n763\n00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:56.260\ntalking about the concepts of how\na packet actually originates.\n\n764\n00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.690\nAll the way through the router and,\n\n765\n00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.640\nof course,\ninto the networks that it needs to go on.\n\n766\n00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.190\nWe also then took a look, of course,\nabout how to configure and\n\n767\n00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.270\nthe concepts of static routing as well.\n\n768\n00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.710\nRemember that in static routing\nyou must configure both sides.\n\n769\n00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.740\nIf you do not, even though you\nconfigure a route to get out,\n\n770\n00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.070\nit doesn't mean that packets can\nactually return on the other side\n\n771\n00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.860\nif it doesn't have a route\nto come back in as well.\n\n772\n00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:23.010\nTodd also of course, showed us\nthe benefit of using default routes,\n\n773\n00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:27.860\nespecially with stub networks\nthat we may also encounter too.\n\n774\n00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.880\nAnd those are kind of some\nof the basics we'll see.\n\n775\n00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.790\nNow, we're not by any means done\nwith the idea of routing here.\n\n776\n00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.030\nAs Todd just mentioned,\nwe also have dynamic routing to go, but\n\n777\n00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.580\nthis is a great place for\nus to go ahead and break for this episode.\n\n778\n00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.300\nSo signing off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n779\n00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.390\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n780\n00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:50.162\n>> And stay tuned right here for\nmore CCENT content.\n\n781\n00:37:50.162 --> 00:37:58.110\n[SOUND]\n\n",

These protocols are Distance Vector based, like RIP, IGRP and even EIGRP and LInk-State protocols like OSPF and IS-IS.  Instead of manually configuring routing, configuring with routing protocols allow you to choose how the routing table will be built according to the administrative distance and metrics.  He demonstrates the configuration of RIPv2 along with passive-interface.",

00:00:17.110\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.440\ntoday we're continuing on\nwith some ICND1 content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.460\nWe're getting ready for that new exam,\nand, in our studios joining us to help us\n\n6\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.500\nto understand more about it,\nit's gonna be Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n7\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.750\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n8\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.620\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.630\nExcellent!\n\n10\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.500\nLet's finish off this IP routing section.\n\n11\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.560\nDynamic routing is a new objective.\n\n12\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.860\nNow in my last book, for the last time,\nI put in RIP routing because they only had\n\n13\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.200\nOSPF as an objective in the C-sent\nwhich they no longer have, so but\n\n14\n00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.360\nI put in RIP in because it's really hard\nto go from static routing to OSPF, right?\n\n15\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.990\nIt was kinda hard to\nunderstand those concepts.\n\n16\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.760\nSo I put in RIP, and\n\n17\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.195\na lot of people were writing me\ngoing you're an idiot, whatever.\n\n18\n00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:58.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I,\n\n19\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.325\nbut it ended up on every exam, so.\n\n20\n00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:02.707\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you didn't know RIP routing and\n\n21\n00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.790\ndidn't have my book,\nthen you were in trouble.\n\n22\n00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.727\nMy point is, just because it's not listed\nas an objective doesn't mean they're not\n\n23\n00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:10.213\ngonna use it in the objectives.\n\n24\n00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:12.070\nThey can test on anything at any time.\n\n25\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.810\nI doubt they'll throw SPF in here and\nwe're not gonna cover it as he said.\n\n26\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.730\nBut I still would watch ICD2 before\nyou even watch C-sent as well.\n\n27\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.500\nSo let's dive into RIP routing\ndynamic routing protocols.\n\n28\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.174\nTalk about those things like\nadministrative distance I've been\n\n29\n00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:26.766\nbringing up.\n\n30\n00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.290\nOkay, first off, the routing table.\n\n31\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.523\nLet's take a look at some different\nentries now cuz we only have\n\n32\n00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:33.235\nthe static route in our routers.\n\n33\n00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:36.746\nWe have their static entries, and\nour default route gatewayblast for short.\n\n34\n00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:38.870\nSo, let's take a look at this.\n\n35\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.820\nWhoops.\n\n36\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.840\nShow IP route.\n\n37\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.349\nNow, [LAUGH] we can see a little bit more,\na few more codes here.\n\n38\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.090\nBut take a look here,\nlet's go through each one of these.\n\n39\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.430\nC stands for directly connected,\nthis is my link.\n\n40\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.710\nThis is a RIP injected route,\ncheck this out.\n\n41\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.550\nNotice these brackets, this is for\neach one, we'll come back to this.\n\n42\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.416\nO is for OSPF.\n\n43\n00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:00.174\nD is for EIJRP.\n\n44\n00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:02.075\nS is for static.\n\n45\n00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.080\nAnd L's our link, right?\n\n46\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.247\nAnd here's our default route.\n\n47\n00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:07.460\nThere's a little bit of everything here,\nyou see today.\n\n48\n00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.916\nSo anyways, directly connected, so\nour RIP route here, so we see this 120 or\n\n49\n00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:18.456\nreally what we see here is a brackets with\nadministrative distance slash metric,\n\n50\n00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:20.190\nis what this is.\n\n51\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.910\nAll right?\nSo, we'll talk\n\n52\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.270\nabout administrative distance.\n\n53\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.420\nSo, the lower the administrative\ndistance the better.\n\n54\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.300\nAnd, we can see this is 120,\n110, 90 and one.\n\n55\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.764\nZero is directly connected up here,\nso these here,\n\n56\n00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:32.480\nthere are administrative\ndistances of zero.\n\n57\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.180\nIt's the best you can get, and we'll\nsee them in a slide here in a second.\n\n58\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.030\nBut this is how you would\nsee something like this.\n\n59\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.640\nI highly recommend that your network\nat your work does not look like this.\n\n60\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.500\nYou should be running one\nrouting protocol today.\n\n61\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.980\nYou know years ago, we had all sorts\nof routing protocols going cuz we\n\n62\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.700\nwere bandaging our networks and they were\ngrowing so fast in the 90s, late 90s.\n\n63\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.440\nThat I'd see all sorts of routing\nprotocols, but that's not necessary today,\n\n64\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.610\nthat's a bad policy.\n\n65\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.560\nAll right, dynamic routing\nprotocol there's two types.\n\n66\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.720\nThere's distance-vector and link-state.\n\n67\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.584\nSo distance-vector requires\nthat the router basically\n\n68\n00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:09.630\nbroadcast out every 30 seconds.\n\n69\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.070\nIn this example I use RIP\nbecause it's distance factor.\n\n70\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.860\nEvery 30 seconds I broadcast out\nmy complete routing table out\n\n71\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.430\nevery active interface, right?\n\n72\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.790\nThis is why we don't want to use RIP,\nit's just a big broadcast space,\n\n73\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.960\nand even when we get to RIP version 2,\nit's really not that much better, right?\n\n74\n00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.190\nSo, EIGRP notice is listed\nunder distance-vector here, but\n\n75\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.590\nit's considered an advance distance-vector\nwhenever you use broadcast.\n\n76\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.630\nWe don't even send updates.\n\n77\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.506\nWe'll get into EIGRP and ICND2, but this\nis an example here where they could say\n\n78\n00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:39.350\nwhichever they've been following\nthe distance-vector routing protocols.\n\n79\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.226\nThis has a lot of distance-vector\nqualities but it also has qualities of\n\n80\n00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:48.930\nlink-state, right, where link-state builds\nmore than one table, distance-vector\n\n81\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.630\njust builds a routing table, and\nEIGRP will build multiple tables as well.\n\n82\n00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.860\nThat's a link-state qualities that keeps\nthe network more stable, we don't have to\n\n83\n00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.010\nsend updates like RIP does and\nwe never send routing table information.\n\n84\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.450\nAll right so\nin this sense this is a distance-vector.\n\n85\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.240\nAnd basically is it has it and\nsometimes it's called a hybrid, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.390\nA hybrid routing protocol.\n\n87\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.225\nOkay.\nExamples of link-state are OSPF and\n\n88\n00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:17.120\nIS-IS they know the network better,\ncan never have have a network loop.\n\n89\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.180\nThey work very very well.\n\n90\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.350\nUse very little bandwidth but\nthey use a lot of router processing.\n\n91\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.670\nSo Cisco says hey buy a better router and\nyou'll save on bandwidth and\n\n92\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.030\nthat in the late 90s or\nearly 2000s that was a big deal.\n\n93\n00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.240\nBandwidth was very expensive.\n\n94\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.350\nAnd although routers were expensive,\nthey weren't as much as bandwidth.\n\n95\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.940\nNow, some dynamic routing\nprotocols use different metrics.\n\n96\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.410\nHere's my metrics here, all right?\n\n97\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.360\nThese are commonly used.\n\n98\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.290\nWe have bandwidth.\n\n99\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.370\nSo, bandwidth and delay, this would be\nEIGRP, they use bandwidth and delay.\n\n100\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.220\nOSP just uses bandwidth,\nand that's called cost.\n\n101\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.810\nAll right?\n\n102\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.090\nSo these are the kind of things that\ncould easily be on the objectives.\n\n103\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.330\nYou're gonna get an OSPF question.\n\n104\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.580\nWhat does it use for a metric?\n\n105\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.710\nAnd you just list it here,\nsomething like this.\n\n106\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.740\nSo that's why we're gonna\nlearn our foundation here.\n\n107\n00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.220\nI'm not gonna configure OSPF and\nEIGRP in this section.\n\n108\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.820\nCost.\n\n109\n00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.030\nOkay, this again, OSPF.\n\n110\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.520\nIt's considered cost and we'll get into\nthat when we get into the OSPF, and\n\n111\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.630\nthen hop count.\n\n112\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.380\nHere we go.\n\n113\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.840\nThis is RIP, all right.\n\n114\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.600\nHow many routers do I go through?\n\n115\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.760\nThe less routers I go through,\nthe better, right?\n\n116\n00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.100\nSo it's a very old metric,\nnot very efficient in today's network.\n\n117\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.970\nRouting protocols are used between\nrouters to determine the path of a packet\n\n118\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.070\nthrough a network by building a network\nmap, and we call that a routing table.\n\n119\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.160\nShow IP Route, show IPv6 Route.\n\n120\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.270\nAnd they maintain routing protocol.\n\n121\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.130\nSome examples?\n\n122\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.690\nRip version 2.\n\n123\n00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.830\nWe can't even use version really 1 today,\ncuz they're all, it's classful.\n\n124\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.150\nAnd we know the difference between\nclassfull and classless, right?\n\n125\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.880\nSo these are classless,\nRip version 2, OSPF, NEIJRP.\n\n126\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.380\nThese are, although they list ISIS on a\nlink site, these are out CCNA objectives.\n\n127\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.590\nOkay, routed protocols are assigned\nto an interface to logical accuracy.\n\n128\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.223\nAll right, and so it's a mailman.\n\n129\n00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:03.660\nThis router protocol's sent pack\nas assumed data to the network.\n\n130\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.220\nOnce a routing protocol's built a map,\nall right, so\n\n131\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.699\nthis is our mailman, IP or IPv6 right?\n\n132\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:18.230\nRouting protocols run in the CCNA and\nsomething called a autonomous system.\n\n133\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.710\nInside that autonomous system we run\nwhat's called interior gateway protocol.\n\n134\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.967\nAnd that's gonna be RIP Version two,\nEIGRP and OSPF.\n\n135\n00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:29.548\nBut wait, when we get to the ICD2 we're\ngonna run an exterior gateway protocol for\n\n136\n00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:32.500\nthe first time in the Season A called BGP.\n\n137\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.149\nSo stick around to ICD2 next\nwhen we turn on VGP and\n\n138\n00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:37.990\nwe can connect autonomous\nsystems together.\n\n139\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.570\nNow that's a lot of fun,\nyou don't want to miss that one.\n\n140\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.297\nNow Classful and\nClassless we've already talked about this,\n\n141\n00:06:44.297 --> 00:06:49.078\nbut classful is something we can't use\ntoday, RIP and EIGRP were examples, and\n\n142\n00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:54.160\nthey would send something like this,\nhey all of 192 168 10.0 is over here.\n\n143\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.880\nAnd we could have subnetted that\nforethought Cat with dozens of subnets and\n\n144\n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.380\nput them in different\nparts of the network.\n\n145\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.040\nDoesn't matter, this can't handle that.\n\n146\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.230\nSo we can't use Classful,\nwe can only use Classless.\n\n147\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.955\nSo Classless would just\nsend something like this.\n\n148\n00:07:08.955 --> 00:07:11.390\n192168.\n10.16/28, something like that.\n\n149\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.960\nThat's the different between RIP Version\n1 and RIP Version 2 in this example.\n\n150\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.170\nThis is why we can use, RIP Version\n2 still sucks like RIP Version 1,\n\n151\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.380\nit really does, but\nit has the process of being able to send\n\n152\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.160\nin tow the subnet mask information which\nallows it to work it, so we just basically\n\n153\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.320\nmade it work in today's networks, but I\nhighly don't recommend in the Enterprise.\n\n154\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.960\nBut I don't know if you notice this but\nin my lab I had it running wide.\n\n155\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.280\nIt's easy it's fast and it works in\na small little network like that so\n\n156\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.650\nit was certainly easier than\nputting in static routing for me.\n\n157\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.150\nSo in my lab just to get that up and\nrunning for\n\n158\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.610\nthis class I had turned on RIP.\n\n159\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.250\nThat was a perfect example of when\nyou'd use something like that.\n\n160\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.770\nWhat's the other reason we would use RIP?\n\n161\n00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.840\nWe have multiple vendors.\n\n162\n00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.350\nRight?\n\n163\n00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.710\nSo RIP is a nonproprietary,\nOSPF is nonproprietary.\n\n164\n00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.452\nNow EIGRP is all Cisco,\nalthough they released it, to be clear,\n\n165\n00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:05.161\nthey released it to the IETF.\n\n166\n00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:07.129\nI haven't seen anyone\nelse implement it yet, so\n\n167\n00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.070\nwhat is still considered what is\nkind of proprietary for Cisco.\n\n168\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.100\nThe administrative distance,\nimportant to understand here.\n\n169\n00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.450\nHow trustworthy is this route, right?\n\n170\n00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.730\nI don't care if let's say that you\nhave multiple routing protocols and\n\n171\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.830\none of them has a better\nroute than the other.\n\n172\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.260\nThat could easily happen.\n\n173\n00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.050\nThe one with the lowest administrative\ndistance worked even if it's not\n\n174\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.110\nas good a route.\n\n175\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.210\nThat's the facts.\n\n176\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.930\nAdministrative distance first.\n\n177\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.780\nTrustworthiness first, even if you're\nnot as good of a route, doesn't matter.\n\n178\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.590\nDirectly connected you can't\nget anything better than that.\n\n179\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.808\nStatic routes by default\nare one as we know.\n\n180\n00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:41.620\nWhen we changed that, I showed you\nhow to change that at the end,\n\n181\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.379\nI'm changing those to 150 and\nmade those floating routes.\n\n182\n00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.558\nRIP is 120.\n\n183\n00:08:47.558 --> 00:08:49.152\nRIP isn't trusted very well is it?\n\n184\n00:08:49.152 --> 00:08:50.431\n[LAUGH] And I don't think it should be.\n\n185\n00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:51.900\nIt's about 50% trusted, right?\n\n186\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.458\nIt goes up 255,\nwhere you can't get there from here.\n\n187\n00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.258\nIGRP, which you don't use anymore was 100.\n\n188\n00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:59.030\nEIGRP, 90, OSPF, 110.\n\n189\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.930\nSo let me give you an example here guys.\n\n190\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.100\nIf I have RIP, IGRP,\n\n191\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.290\nEIGRP and, I won't turn out IGRP but\nwe'll just go ahead and pretend we did.\n\n192\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.320\nI don't even think, if I go and\ntry to turn it on it wouldn't work.\n\n193\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.250\nRIP, EIGRP and\nOSPF are enabled on all my routers.\n\n194\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.750\nWhat's going to show up\nin the routing table?\n\n195\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.300\nOne thing.\nAnd in this example where I have RIP,\n\n196\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.380\nEIGRP, and OSPF, the one with the low\nadministrative distance will show up and\n\n197\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.270\nthat would be EIGRP.\n\n198\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.910\nOkay, same thing here, I have 172,\n17, 8, 0, how do I get there?\n\n199\n00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:37.100\nThrough 5.2, in this case here EIGRP\nhas administrative distance of 90 so\n\n200\n00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.920\nthat's what's gonna show\nup in the routing table.\n\n201\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.270\nOSPF, even though it could be\na better route, is not gonna show up.\n\n202\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.280\nDoesn't matter if someone\nhas a better route.\n\n203\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.180\nAdministrative distance is\nthe first thing that's checked.\n\n204\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.080\nThat is the one that is gonna\nmake the determination here.\n\n205\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.400\nOkay, in this case I have EIGRP\ncoming over here to router D.\n\n206\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.460\nAnd I have RIP coming over\nhere to router D as well,\n\n207\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.690\nadvertising the same network,\nand that's gonna be discarded.\n\n208\n00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.600\nSo first thing administrative distance.\n\n209\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.470\nThen we check metrics.\n\n210\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.270\nOkay, so if I have RIP, I'm going to use\nHop Count, so notice here I've advertised,\n\n211\n00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.585\nlet's just say, keep it simple here,\nI'm advertising that we're ten.\n\n212\n00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:18.170\nI come over here, this router gets\nan advertisement for network 10, and\n\n213\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.550\nsays cool, I can get to network\nten from this interface, whatever.\n\n214\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.940\nBut RIP says look another route,\nI'm going to go this way as well.\n\n215\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.840\nAnd it comes in this interface.\n\n216\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.200\nAnd it's cool.\n\n217\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.370\nLet me check the administrative distance.\n\n218\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.590\nWell, they're both RIP,\nso they're both 120.\n\n219\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.650\nSo, check and check.\n\n220\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.510\nI can use both.\n\n221\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.360\nLet me see if they're equal.\n\n222\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.120\nBecause all routing protocols, RIP,\nIGRP, and OSPF, will load bounce across\n\n223\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.620\nequal cross paths by default for\nup to four links by default.\n\n224\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.700\nWe can configure it.\n\n225\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.840\nWell, most of it's 16, some of them we can\nconfigure with the new 15 code to 32 pass.\n\n226\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.210\nThat's a lot.\n\n227\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.530\nBut by default,\nfour is what we wanna remember.\n\n228\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.280\nIt'll automatically do this,\nno configuration needed.\n\n229\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.390\nAll right, so in this case here it says\nhey, I have two paths to network ten,\n\n230\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.990\nboth administratives at 120,\nlet me check our metric.\n\n231\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.530\nI'm running RIP.\n\n232\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.638\nMy Hop Count, right?\n\n233\n00:11:07.638 --> 00:11:08.538\nSo here we go.\n\n234\n00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:11.398\nOne, two, nice.\n\n235\n00:11:11.398 --> 00:11:16.710\nOne, two, my gosh, they're both equal.\n\n236\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.440\nMy metrics are the same,\nso I'm gonna load mount.\n\n237\n00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.340\nBut are they really?\n\n238\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:21.950\nThey are not.\n\n239\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.090\nThis is a 512k link and a T3.\n\n240\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.510\nAnd I mentioned these cuz\nit's kind of an old issue and\n\n241\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.300\nthis is one of the reasons\nyou don't run RIP.\n\n242\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.250\nThis was such a prevalent issue\nthat what would happen is it would\n\n243\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.460\nsqueeze out a little here, and\nas much as you can send down that link,\n\n244\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.070\nit would send the same down here.\n\n245\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.238\nTheir T3s just became 512k links.\n\n246\n00:11:38.238 --> 00:11:40.018\nYou can send the same\namount of data down both.\n\n247\n00:11:40.018 --> 00:11:42.000\nCuz it does this round robin thing.\n\n248\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.068\nThis was such a prevalent issue they\nactually came up with a name for it.\n\n249\n00:11:45.068 --> 00:11:47.688\nIt's called pinhole congestion,\npinhole congestion.\n\n250\n00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:48.760\nHow do you fix it?\n\n251\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.370\nWell you don't run RIP.\n\n252\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.730\nSo that was the issue.\n\n253\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.780\nThere was really no way to fix this, or\nyou just disconnect your slower links.\n\n254\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.850\nThat was it, or\nelse we'll run something else.\n\n255\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.090\nSo let's do EIGRP now.\n\n256\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.730\nLet's turn on something better,\nEIGRP, which uses bandwidth and\n\n257\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.920\ndelay as a metric.\n\n258\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.930\nSo it's gonna check my bandwidth and\ndelay and\n\n259\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.020\nfind out I'm only gonna go this direction.\n\n260\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.400\nI'm not gonna go through the 512k links.\n\n261\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.640\nSo it's gonna check them both, but\n\n262\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.400\nEIGRP is kinda cool and uses a backup\nroute called feasible successor and\n\n263\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.060\nstores that there just in case\nthe primary link goes down.\n\n264\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.730\nEIGRP is kind of a cool routing protocol.\n\n265\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.715\nAll right, RIP overview,\nwe only use Hop we can only go 15 Hops so\n\n266\n00:12:27.715 --> 00:12:29.540\nit limits the size.\n\n267\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.978\nI got to be honest with you 15 Hops is\nquite a ways even in todays networks but\n\n268\n00:12:32.978 --> 00:12:36.633\n16 is considered unreachable, so when we\ndo RIP we're gonna take a look at this\n\n269\n00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:40.590\nbecause let's see if something goes\ndown I want to show you something.\n\n270\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.278\nFull route table broadcast\nthis is the problem with RIP,\n\n271\n00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:45.170\nfull route table broadcast.\n\n272\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.050\nNow this is in RIP Version 1,\nbecause we're broadcasting.\n\n273\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.870\nRIP Version 2, we use multicast.\n\n274\n00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.470\nBut nonetheless, it's still a lot of data.\n\n275\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.400\nAll right, load balance,\n16 pass, 4 by default.\n\n276\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.590\nAnd Rip Version 2, which we're gonna use,\nthat's, we support VLSM, how?\n\n277\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.100\nBecause we send the subnet mask\ninformation with the route update.\n\n278\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.890\nOkay, and then we also can\ndo discontinuous networks,\n\n279\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.950\nwhich we'll define here in a second.\n\n280\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.860\nSo to config a RIP,\nthis is why people use it.\n\n281\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.340\nYou just route a RIP and\nyou're pretty much done.\n\n282\n00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.110\nNow you do have to know what your\ndirectly connected networks are, and\n\n283\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.600\nwe can do that with the show IP\ninterface beef, show protocol, show one.\n\n284\n00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.610\nWhatever you wanna choose to find\nyour directly connected networks.\n\n285\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.710\nThat's all, routing's all about me.\n\n286\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.780\nRouting is about me and\nabout what I'm looking at right here.\n\n287\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.380\nDoesn't even matter what my\nneighbors are doing, about me.\n\n288\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.820\nI do a show run,\nsee what I'm directly connected to, and\n\n289\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.930\njust type those in and I'm done.\n\n290\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.310\nAnd it's gonna start working.\n\n291\n00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.540\nBut we're going to tap into a couple\nother parameters I want to show you.\n\n292\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.020\nSo first off,\nthis is done in a classical manner.\n\n293\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.940\nSo notice here, on this router,\nwe'll call router A, I guess.\n\n294\n00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.540\nNetwork, that's a class A, isn't it, so\nwhen I go into RIP, I'm only going to\n\n295\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.250\ntype in the first octet because it's\na class A and we're doing class routing.\n\n296\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.240\nSaying hey, all network 10 is over here.\n\n297\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.600\nNow that's the classful\nmanner I was talking about.\n\n298\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.510\nThen, we're going to configure\nit to make it classless.\n\n299\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.066\nBut it's not by default so stand by.\n\n300\n00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:06.700\nNetwork 172.16 cuz that's class B.\n\n301\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.440\nSo I have to type in the first two octets.\n\n302\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.250\nOn this one over here I have a class C.\n\n303\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.180\nSo I'm gonna type in\nthe first three octets.\n\n304\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.210\nIf I'm running RIP Version 1, I'm done.\n\n305\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.480\nI'm in a classful manner.\n\n306\n00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.040\nThis is just gonna come up and\nstart working, all right?\n\n307\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.738\nThat's all it takes to\nget router RIP working.\n\n308\n00:14:22.738 --> 00:14:24.158\nWell Version 2 though is\nwhat we're gonna use.\n\n309\n00:14:24.158 --> 00:14:26.590\nWe're gonna add a couple\nof more commands here.\n\n310\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.690\nThe first thing I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna go into there, and\n\n311\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.110\nit's really difficult to do this.\n\n312\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.045\nI'm gonna go into there and tell it to run\nVersion 2, by typing in Version 2, okay.\n\n313\n00:14:34.045 --> 00:14:36.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's difficult about this is that you\n\n314\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.120\ndo it all your hours.\n\n315\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.720\nYou forget it on one.\n\n316\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.920\nWell that router is not gonna work, right?\n\n317\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.920\nThat's the trouble shooting\nspot we want to go.\n\n318\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.370\nLet's talk about what\nRIP Version 2 gives us.\n\n319\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.510\nIt's distance vector, same, administrative\ndistance of 120, same timers.\n\n320\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.980\nEasy configuration,\njust add the command version 2.\n\n321\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.008\nRight, very easy.\n\n322\n00:14:55.008 --> 00:14:58.369\nBut it uses the multicast addresses, this\nis the kind of thing you gotta remember.\n\n323\n00:14:58.369 --> 00:15:05.556\n224.0.0.9, 224.0.0.9, we use that same\nnumber, not the 224 part, that 9.\n\n324\n00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:09.980\nWe'll see it when we get to IP Version 6\nwhen we're doing RIP in next generation.\n\n325\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.450\nRIP Version 2 allows update\nauthentication as well, has a handshake.\n\n326\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.000\nMost people do not use this, but\nit has the possibility of doing that.\n\n327\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.150\nSo there's one other command,\njust one that we need,\n\n328\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.300\nand we'll take a look at that.\n\n329\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.062\nThat's to solve a discontiguous\nadvertising issue and\n\n330\n00:15:24.062 --> 00:15:25.210\nto advertise something.\n\n331\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.260\nYou wanna type this in every time and\n\n332\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.250\nyou can only do it if you're\nrunning Version 2 not Version 1.\n\n333\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.760\nThis is gonna make it\nclassless at this point.\n\n334\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.281\nOkay, so, basically this started because\nwe had a core and we ended up with say\n\n335\n00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:41.340\na 10 network and then we had our\nsubnet separated around it, right?\n\n336\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.800\nThat created a discontinuous network.\n\n337\n00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.940\nWe had one part of a subnet from one\nclass, using that same class over here in\n\n338\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.250\na different subnet,\nacross a different network class.\n\n339\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.450\nThat does not work by default.\n\n340\n00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.879\nOnly on OSPF does that work by default.\n\n341\n00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:55.051\nSo, on RIP Version 2,\n\n342\n00:15:55.051 --> 00:15:58.660\nand sometimes on EIGRP,\nagain I'll hold off on that subject.\n\n343\n00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.281\nOkay, so, RIP Version 1 and IGRP,\nthis doesn't even work with it.\n\n344\n00:16:02.281 --> 00:16:05.725\nOSPF, EIGRP and\nrip version 2 can advertise sub nets.\n\n345\n00:16:05.725 --> 00:16:09.260\nBut with EIGRP and\nrip version two we have to tell it to.\n\n346\n00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.480\nIt depends on what version\nof EIGRP you're running.\n\n347\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.210\nTo fix it,\nall we have to do is the no auto summary.\n\n348\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.580\nI'm telling you, type that in every time.\n\n349\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.400\nNo auto.\nIf you would\n\n350\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.840\nhave looked at my config you would see\nthat I had version no auto under RIP.\n\n351\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.170\nAgain, it's not a lot of configuration,\nwe'll take a look.\n\n352\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.070\nOne more thing I wanna show you before we\nrun out to our lab, this is the passive\n\n353\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.650\ninterface, check this out, and this is\na new objective for the c-sen actually.\n\n354\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000\nSo router rip type in my\nclassical network numbers,\n\n355\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.120\ntyped in version 2 no auto-summary.\n\n356\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.930\nThis is very simple configuration.\n\n357\n00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.040\nI'm running version 2.\n\n358\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.200\nIt's up and running.\n\n359\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200\nI wouldn't say my network is great.\n\n360\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.560\nAnd it doesn't work in a large network.\n\n361\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.858\nI've had classes of 20 students,\nand we each two or three routers.\n\n362\n00:16:48.858 --> 00:16:50.915\nAnd everything's connected together.\n\n363\n00:16:50.915 --> 00:16:52.412\nAnd rip would never converge.\n\n364\n00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:54.400\nIt was too much for rip to handle.\n\n365\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.230\nSo, it can't work in\nthat type of environment,\n\n366\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.510\nit has to be something like my lab here.\n\n367\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.300\nOkay, but, notice this guy.\n\n368\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.850\nLet's say that he's connected\nto the internet here.\n\n369\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.580\nRight?\nSo, I'm gonna do two things.\n\n370\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.900\nOne of the things that I mentioned to you,\n\n371\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.990\nis I'm gonna put a default\nroute on this router.\n\n372\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.310\nI'm gonna do ip router rip, but\nI'm gonna add a default route.\n\n373\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.530\nThat tells me to go to\nthe Internet as well.\n\n374\n00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.710\nThen I'm gonna come down here and use\nthe command I just talked about earlier,\n\n375\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.580\nwhich is the default information\noriginate command that says,\n\n376\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.000\nadvertise this to my other routers,\ndefault information originate.\n\n377\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.740\nAll right.\n\n378\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.480\nSo router rip, class 4 networks version 2,\nno auto summary.\n\n379\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.330\nBut wait, okay,\nthose are my configs that I have in here.\n\n380\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.530\nAnd I'm gonna advertise my default\nroute to my other routers down stream.\n\n381\n00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.840\nNow, but wait there's more.\n\n382\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.000\nThe new objectives are right up here.\n\n383\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.850\nRouter rip okay,\nunderneath that routing RIP process\n\n384\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.320\nI'm gonna add what's\ncalled passive interfaces.\n\n385\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.220\nI don't want to advertise\nrip out here do I.\n\n386\n00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.450\nI really don't.\n\n387\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.180\nSo there's a couple\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n388\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.365\nThis seems really crazy but\nthis is the objective.\n\n389\n00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.790\npassive-interface default.\n\n390\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.730\nWhat that says is, turn on rip, but\n\n391\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.150\ndon't advertise my routing\nprotocol out any interfaces.\n\n392\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.960\nYou basically disabled rip, right?\n\n393\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.480\nSo turn on rip, put in all these commands,\nand then disable on every interface.\n\n394\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.340\nWhat?\n\n395\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.540\nSo, if you have a lot of interfaces, and\nyou only want it on one or two, it might\n\n396\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.640\nbe easier to turn them all off, and then\ntell the ones that you want it on, right?\n\n397\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.710\nThat's the objective,\nyou're gonna remember this.\n\n398\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.470\nTurn them all off, turn them on\nthe ones you want them on, right.\n\n399\n00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.530\nSo no passive interface on this one here.\n\n400\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.440\nThis is a way to do it.\n\n401\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.790\nI'm not telling you to do it this way.\n\n402\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.440\nCisco's telling you to do it this way.\n\n403\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.780\nPassive interface default, no passive\ninterface on the ones I don't want.\n\n404\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.800\nI'm gonna send it out.\n\n405\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.290\nSo now I'm not sending rip out.\n\n406\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.510\nShould you use passive interfaces?\n\n407\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.600\nSure you should.\n\n408\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.380\nNo way should this be send on\na lan where there's no routers.\n\n409\n00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.250\nYou're just talking about\nway too much traffic.\n\n410\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.420\nTo verify rip, these are the ones we're\ngoing to use when we run out to our lab\n\n411\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.350\nwhich we're gonna do.\n\n412\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.130\nThere's a new one in the objectives\nright here from last time.\n\n413\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.270\nShow ip protocols.\n\n414\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.850\nNotice these are all user\nmode commands my friends,\n\n415\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.490\ndon't have to be in privilege mode.\n\n416\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.340\nShow IP protocols, show ip route,\nshow ip rip database, right?\n\n417\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.530\nAnd then debug ip rip.\n\n418\n00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.942\nWhat do you say we go take a look at this?\n\n419\n00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:09.580\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna come out here on my core.\n\n420\n00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.540\nNow remember, this is all about me.\n\n421\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:17.770\nSo, I don't have to know about my routers,\nmy neighbors, I only care about me.\n\n422\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:18.900\nMe, me, me, me, me.\n\n423\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.320\nAll right so config t.\n\n424\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.780\nWell first off I can do show run or\nshow IP int brief.\n\n425\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.040\nNow when I do this I'm just\ngonna leave this on the screen.\n\n426\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.570\nThere's my ip addresses this says hey type\nthis these under rip and you're done.\n\n427\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.340\nRight that's all you have to do.\n\n428\n00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:33.890\nSame thing with [INAUDIBLE].\n\n429\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.200\nThat's why I love people.\n\n430\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.510\nWhat they did is they made ERGRP\nmuch better routing protocol with\n\n431\n00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.770\nthe simplicity or rip in the front so\nyou just kind of do the same thing.\n\n432\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.359\nWe'll see that.\nRouter rip.\n\n433\n00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:48.580\n[LAUGH]\nConfig t, router rip.\n\n434\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.382\nOkay, now we gotta see my ip addresses.\n\n435\n00:19:53.785 --> 00:19:55.336\nOkay, network.\n\n436\n00:19:55.336 --> 00:19:59.380\n10.\nNow remember [INAUDIBLE] error.\n\n437\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.790\nI can type in 10.10.10.0 here and\nit will take it.\n\n438\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.880\nIt's just it'll be there to show Rodney\ndid you see that I changed it to 10.0.0.0.\n\n439\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.200\nOkay then network.\n\n440\n00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.390\nNow check out I'm just going to 172\nit's class B 16.0.0 it's going to cover\n\n441\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.350\nevery subnet in that class with\nthat start with 172.16.0.0.\n\n442\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.160\nI'm done basically with my networks.\n\n443\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.350\nNow I'm running rip version 1.\n\n444\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.810\nI don't want to do that so\nI'm going to type in Version 2.\n\n445\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.230\nAnd no what?\n\n446\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.000\n>> Auto.\n>> Auto-summary.\n\n447\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.820\nNow I'm done, right.\n\n448\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.400\nNow, if I was to look at that, I could\nsay my fast Ethernet 00 goes to my core,\n\n449\n00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.060\nif I look at my design I can see that.\n\n450\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.360\nSo, I could easily just say\npassive-interface, it was f0/0, right?\n\n451\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.050\nSo I have my passive interface on there.\n\n452\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.570\nTelling you guys, the past interface is\ngoing to bit obstructive because what's\n\n453\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.610\ngonna happen is that they gonna\nask why isn't this working,\n\n454\n00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.160\nprobably get some sort\nof similar software.\n\n455\n00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.740\nI have no idea but their gonna just\nhave passive interfaces, easily\n\n456\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.350\nthis is a great troubleshooting thing\nthat i would set up if I was stuck and\n\n457\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.100\nput a passive interface somewhere.\n\n458\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.380\nAnd you're gonna then say,\nwhy isn't this routing.\n\n459\n00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.210\nWorking right?\n\n460\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.770\nLook for your passive interfaces.\n\n461\n00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.060\nThey're always under the routing process,\nnot on the interfaces.\n\n462\n00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.460\nAll right, so I'm done with corp.\n\n463\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.730\nLet's go to San Francisco.\n\n464\n00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.050\nThis is all about me so I really\ndon't care about what I did on corp.\n\n465\n00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.710\nMakes no difference to me.\n\n466\n00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.950\nFirst thing I'm gonna type in,\nshow ip int brief.\n\n467\n00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.595\nConfig t.\n\n468\n00:21:21.595 --> 00:21:28.880\nRouter rip, Network 192.168.10.0,\nand I got a 40.0 too.\n\n469\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.810\nNow this is a class c, so\nwhen I'm looking at this,\n\n470\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:40.740\nguys check this out if you can see this,\nyou've got a 192.168.10,\n\n471\n00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.070\nAnd then when I choose 68.40,\nI can not do this and cover them both.\n\n472\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.000\nCuz all this is saying is I'm\ncovering the 0network, right?\n\n473\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.280\nI have to type in all three octets.\n\n474\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.950\nSo this is a good\ntroubleshooting spot as well,\n\n475\n00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.730\nmaking sure your network\nstatements are correct.\n\n476\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.760\nReally there's not a lot to it.\n\n477\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.380\nSo making sure your network statements are\ncorrect are top of your list here, buddy.\n\n478\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.110\nAll right, 10.0, 40.0, and\nthen we've got the [COUGH] 172.16.0.0.\n\n479\n00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.520\nOkay?\n\n480\n00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.360\nAnd then we're gonna do the no auto and\nversion 2.\n\n481\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.720\nAll right, I could do a passive\ninterface on here, f00.\n\n482\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.930\nProbably in real life I\nreally would do this,\n\n483\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.690\nbecause You're sending all this data to\nthis host so you really don't want it.\n\n484\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.420\nEven though it's multicast, in this case,\nthey still have to process that.\n\n485\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.130\nI wouldn't do that.\n\n486\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.350\nAll right, and\nif I came over here, hold on.\n\n487\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.070\nLet me stay here for a second.\n\n488\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.900\nI should be able to see\nsomething from a corp already.\n\n489\n00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.000\nShow ip route.\n\n490\n00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.200\nNah.\n\n491\n00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:42.570\nStatice.\n\n492\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.890\nI don't see anything yet.\n\n493\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.864\nThink I did everything right.\n\n494\n00:22:46.864 --> 00:22:53.980\n[COUGH] I have the static routes in there.\n\n495\n00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.410\nWait, one of the things is, remember,\nmy static route, my default route,\n\n496\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.290\nis in there, and\nit has a low administrator.\n\n497\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.880\nThis says I didn't change it here I had\namong the code with a higher number but\n\n498\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.170\nonly to the ORAI router.\n\n499\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.880\nThat is gonna affect my routing.\n\n500\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.000\nRemember I have a static routes\nthere with a lower administration.\n\n501\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n502\n00:23:14.145 --> 00:23:15.445\nI'm gotta do something here.\n\n503\n00:23:15.445 --> 00:23:18.535\nI do show IP int brief, right?\n\n504\n00:23:19.645 --> 00:23:23.925\nOkay I've got network 192 168 I\n\n505\n00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:28.781\ngotta type in all three octets except for\nclass B.\n\n506\n00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:33.070\n172.16.0.0 and 192.168.30.0.\n\n507\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.670\nWhoops, I think I need\nthe network command.\n\n508\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.900\nOkay, no auto, version 2, okay.\n\n509\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.990\nIs this gonna work?\n\n510\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.980\nWe'll see, I might have to look at\nthose static routes as an example.\n\n511\n00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:53.240\nSo let's do some debugging, that sounds\nfun, so I'm gonna say debug IP rip.\n\n512\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.573\nNow there's a lot of information here\nbecause rip sense a lot of information and\n\n513\n00:23:56.573 --> 00:23:59.276\nthis shows that rip update being sent and\nreceived on my router.\n\n514\n00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:05.533\nSo I can take a look here and say, rip is\nIs sending, sending, sending, sending.\n\n515\n00:24:05.533 --> 00:24:08.790\nAnd everything's being sent here.\n\n516\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.420\nOkay, so it's from 30.1,\nfrom our own address.\n\n517\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.990\nSo I'm not receiving anything.\n\n518\n00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.413\nLet's go down and take a look why.\n\n519\n00:24:17.413 --> 00:24:19.527\nOkay, I'm gonna come down\nhere to the corp router.\n\n520\n00:24:22.987 --> 00:24:26.527\nFirst off, show IP route.\n\n521\n00:24:26.527 --> 00:24:31.377\nOkay, I see, check this out,\nI'm not, whoops, gosh darn it.\n\n522\n00:24:31.377 --> 00:24:35.278\nI'm not surprised that I'm seeing 20 and\n30, why?\n\n523\n00:24:35.278 --> 00:24:38.829\nBecause when I did my static\nroutes from here for 20 and 30,\n\n524\n00:24:38.829 --> 00:24:41.680\nI raised the administrative\ndistance to 150.\n\n525\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.770\nSo these came in with an administrative\ndistance of 120, one hop away.\n\n526\n00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.850\nAnd that's gonna take\nover the static routes.\n\n527\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.961\nBut however, notice my 40 here.\n\n528\n00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:53.775\nI am definitely, I guarantee you,\nseeing that 40 network come in here.\n\n529\n00:24:53.775 --> 00:24:56.272\nBut we're seeing it as\nadministrative distance of 1.\n\n530\n00:24:56.272 --> 00:24:59.580\nAll right, so unless I come in here and\ntake, and here's the other one, 10.\n\n531\n00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.300\nAgain, I did not change those.\n\n532\n00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.940\nRight, that's why I'm not seeing\nthat on the San Francisco router.\n\n533\n00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.860\nSo I actually have to come in here.\n\n534\n00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.860\nLet me show you how kinda easy this\nis to take out, actually, because,\n\n535\n00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.290\noops, at first it seems a little\nconvoluted, but if I did a show run,\n\n536\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:19.130\nI'm just gonna go down here,\nthere they are, right there.\n\n537\n00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:24.280\nOkay, so I just do this,\nconfig t, type in no, whoops.\n\n538\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.390\nThat's not very good.\n\n539\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.505\nType in no, and then this guy right here.\n\n540\n00:25:31.505 --> 00:25:35.836\nAnd I'm gonna mark this, and\nI'm just gonna copy paste this in.\n\n541\n00:25:35.836 --> 00:25:38.860\nNotice, the other ones are 150,\nwe see those there.\n\n542\n00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.150\nAnd then copy, paste.\n\n543\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:42.850\nRight.\n\n544\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.810\nAnd actually, I can just update this.\n\n545\n00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.190\nAnd the other one was 40.\n\n546\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.680\nSo I just up arrowed instead of copying,\nand got rid of it.\n\n547\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.388\nWhat did I do wrong there?\n\n548\n00:25:55.388 --> 00:25:58.750\n40, guys, I used the exit interface.\n\n549\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.913\nSo I can update that, and\nthen just do the 40 and then 0/0/0.\n\n550\n00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:09.794\nAnd now, we'll probably see,\nI say probably,\n\n551\n00:26:09.794 --> 00:26:15.050\nthe routing, there they are right there.\n\n552\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.200\nI've got 10, 20, 30, still didn't see 40\nyet, but it'll show up here in a second.\n\n553\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.960\nThere it is.\n\n554\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.880\nAll right, now let's take a look at this.\n\n555\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.280\nI can get to 40, its administrative\ndistance is 120, one hop away via 10.2.\n\n556\n00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.830\nI've got two of them via 10.6 and\nthe EX interface that they're out of.\n\n557\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.370\nNow, the other one,\ntake a look here, show IP proto.\n\n558\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.750\nI can see I have rip here sending\nupdates every 30 seconds.\n\n559\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.440\nNow, you can change these timers, guys.\n\n560\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.490\nI don't recommend doing that, but\n\n561\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.000\nyou can change these timers to\nmake your network stop working.\n\n562\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.240\nI guess it's fun on a rainy, since it's\nraining out, maybe we should do it.\n\n563\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.630\nI like to do things on rainy days.\n\n564\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:54.260\nAll right, next to, and then we have our\ninvalid, hold down, and flushed timers.\n\n565\n00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.020\nNow, where's your troubleshooting spots?\n\n566\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.160\nLet me show you right here.\n\n567\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.690\nSo, when I come down here, I wanna,\n\n568\n00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:05.340\nfirst thing I'm gonna do is verify that\nI'm running version 2 on both send and\n\n569\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.960\nreceive, and then my interfaces that are\nparticipating in rip are both showing up.\n\n570\n00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.718\nNotice, I don't see fast Ethernet.\n\n571\n00:27:12.718 --> 00:27:16.000\nSo show IP protocols is your\nfriend on the new CCENT because\n\n572\n00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.140\nthis allows you to check for\nyour passive interfaces from user mode.\n\n573\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.510\nWithout doing a show run, why is rip\nnot working, or SPF or EIGRP, whatever.\n\n574\n00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.160\nShow IP protocols, check out down here.\n\n575\n00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.920\nI can only see serial interface.\n\n576\n00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.710\nI don't see my fast Ethernet, why?\n\n577\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.730\nI come down here, right here, guys.\n\n578\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.570\nIt says,\nFastEthernet0/0 is a passive interface.\n\n579\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.739\nThis is a huge troubleshooting spot for\nthe new CCENT.\n\n580\n00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:41.298\nThe other thing is, I'm gonna check\nout my network statements here,\n\n581\n00:27:41.298 --> 00:27:44.630\nnetwork 10 and 172.16,\nvery, very important, okay.\n\n582\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.310\nAnd then we can do a debug IP rip as well,\nand let's do that.\n\n583\n00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.390\nAnd let's see one last thing,\nand then we'll be done.\n\n584\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.980\nOkay?\n\n585\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.059\nSo almost done, guys.\n\n586\n00:27:55.059 --> 00:27:55.860\nTwo minutes.\n\n587\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.902\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we've got to wait 30 seconds for\n\n588\n00:27:57.902 --> 00:27:58.434\nrip to update.\n\n589\n00:27:58.434 --> 00:28:00.013\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the thing is, is,\n\n590\n00:28:00.013 --> 00:28:01.040\nlet's see how much data.\n\n591\n00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.290\nI have a small network with three routers.\n\n592\n00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.030\nLet's take a look what we're getting here.\n\n593\n00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.986\nOkay, so I've got, what's this say?\n\n594\n00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:10.080\n>> Two updates received.\n\n595\n00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.530\n>> Yeah, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet this run for a second.\n\n596\n00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.860\nNot seeing a lot of stuff here,\nbut let's go through it.\n\n597\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.310\nI'm gonna let this run.\n\n598\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.740\nAnd then I'm going to do, so\nit says receiving and sending, okay,\n\n599\n00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.220\nI think I have everything I need.\n\n600\n00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.080\nSo I'm going to turn that off.\n\n601\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:31.550\nOkay received update from 172.16.10.6,\nthat's LA, on serial 0, it was one zero.\n\n602\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.820\nAnd it says, hey,\nyou can get to 20 and 30 through me,\n\n603\n00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.590\nand that's LA, I know that's true,\nin one hop away.\n\n604\n00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.890\nSo I'm going to obviously put those in\nmy routing table, I've seen them, okay.\n\n605\n00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.380\nNow, so that's what I received from LA.\n\n606\n00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.020\nNow notice I'm sending\nan update to 224.0.0.9, okay,\n\n607\n00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.600\nvia Serial0/0/0,\nthis is sending it to San Francisco now.\n\n608\n00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.692\nSo what's it gonna see?\n\n609\n00:28:51.692 --> 00:28:56.475\nLook at this, it says, 172.16.10.4,\nremember, it's 10.0 on that link.\n\n610\n00:28:56.475 --> 00:29:00.307\nSo it says, hey, 10.4 is available,\nit's one hop away via me.\n\n611\n00:29:00.307 --> 00:29:03.380\nSo to get there through me, it's one hop.\n\n612\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.569\nAnd 20 and 30 now from\nSan Francisco are what, two hops.\n\n613\n00:29:06.569 --> 00:29:09.357\nBecause they're being\nadvertised to me in one,\n\n614\n00:29:09.357 --> 00:29:14.127\nto get there through me now is gonna cost\nyou two, one to me, and one to them, okay?\n\n615\n00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:18.516\nNow, received update from in this\ncase here San Francisco, 10 and 40,\n\n616\n00:29:18.516 --> 00:29:22.033\nall right, sending version\n2 update out serial 102 LA.\n\n617\n00:29:22.033 --> 00:29:23.252\nCheck out what I'm sending here.\n\n618\n00:29:23.252 --> 00:29:27.049\n172.16.10.0 subnet, the 10 and 40.\n\n619\n00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:29.544\nNow, one of the things that I said,\nand we're gonna make clear.\n\n620\n00:29:29.544 --> 00:29:30.206\nThen we're gonna be done.\n\n621\n00:29:30.206 --> 00:29:32.620\nSo hang in there and\npay attention to this.\n\n622\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.360\nIs, there's something that's run on here.\n\n623\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.500\nWe kinda mentioned it yesterday\nwith the show IP interface command,\n\n624\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.258\nIP split horizon.\n\n625\n00:29:40.258 --> 00:29:43.810\nIP split horizon says,\nif you receive an update on an interface,\n\n626\n00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.900\nyou can't send it back\nout that same interface.\n\n627\n00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.510\nSo I said to you,\n\n628\n00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.370\nrip sends its complete routing table out,\nall active interfaces every 30 seconds.\n\n629\n00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.640\nThat's mostly true.\n\n630\n00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.430\nOn Cisco, they run on their\ninterfaces IP split horizon.\n\n631\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.130\nAnd it says, uh-uh, you received 20 and\n30 on here, we can see it right up here.\n\n632\n00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.940\nAnd this is a nice update,\nI got a perfect update here.\n\n633\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.770\nSo, we're only gonna\n\n634\n00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.040\nsend what we're not directly connected to,\n172.16.10.0, 192.168.10, and 40.\n\n635\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.510\nRight?\nSo, we're only sending our routing table,\n\n636\n00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.740\nyes, but\nnot what we received on that interface.\n\n637\n00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.350\nThis is an example of split horizon.\n\n638\n00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.365\nAll right, Ronnie, hold on,\nI'm almost done here.\n\n639\n00:30:19.365 --> 00:30:22.464\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, right here,\n\n640\n00:30:22.464 --> 00:30:24.402\nI just want to mention, IP Routing.\n\n641\n00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:25.725\nAll right, on lammle.com.\n\n642\n00:30:25.725 --> 00:30:27.234\nYou're now through chapter eight.\n\n643\n00:30:27.234 --> 00:30:32.580\nAll right, and chapter eight review\nquestions, and written labs.\n\n644\n00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.910\nDo not skip the written labs in my book.\n\n645\n00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:35.460\nDo those.\n\n646\n00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.700\nI've made those powerful.\n\n647\n00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.390\nPowerful, that's a great word for\ntalking about a written lab.\n\n648\n00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.550\nTowards the objectives.\n\n649\n00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.240\nThe review questions, those are great.\n\n650\n00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.040\nThen hit the questions on\nLammle.com IP Routing.\n\n651\n00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.220\nYou should be through the IP Routing\nsection, more than halfway done.\n\n652\n00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.960\n>> All right, well, in this episode,\nremember what we took a look at here,\n\n653\n00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.260\nwhich was the basics of dynamic routing.\n\n654\n00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:59.010\nWe talked about of course the difference\nbetween the idea of the link state\n\n655\n00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:03.340\nrouters as well as, of course, distance\nvector routers, routing, kind of the same,\n\n656\n00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.470\nrouters, routing protocols, and\nwe need to be able to distinguish those.\n\n657\n00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:11.620\nSo make sure you understand rip,\nand of course EIGRP, and then\n\n658\n00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.910\nthere's the other ones of course, which\nis gonna be OSPF for us and even ISIS.\n\n659\n00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:20.280\nBut overall, though, we also took\na look briefly then also into rip and\n\n660\n00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.640\nits configuration and understanding that\nwe have classful as well as classless.\n\n661\n00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.660\nMost of the time, you're gonna use rip\nversion two, which is gonna be classless.\n\n662\n00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.060\nAnd to help us with\ndiscontiguous networks,\n\n663\n00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.620\nwe're also gonna enter the no\nauto slash summary command.\n\n664\n00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.050\nThat will also be helpful there, too.\n\n665\n00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.120\nDon't forget that all of\nthese particular protocols,\n\n666\n00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.290\nregardless of which one you use, right,\nthey're gonna show up in the routing table\n\n667\n00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.810\ndepending on that administrative distance,\nthat AD number.\n\n668\n00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.920\nAnd the lower the number, of course,\nthe better that's going to be as well.\n\n669\n00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.530\nSo there's a lot of information here, and\n\n670\n00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:57.310\nif any of this is confusing to you, it\nmeans you need to re-watch this episode.\n\n671\n00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.760\nYou need to take a look\nat Todd's books here,\n\n672\n00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.440\nmake sure you get\nthe confusion out of the way.\n\n673\n00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.580\nRemember that accuracy as well as speed\nis the key to you being successful\n\n674\n00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.590\non the CCENT exam too.\n\n675\n00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.492\nSo, just kind of make sure\nyou review those concepts.\n\n676\n00:32:11.492 --> 00:32:16.490\nGo over, again, these videos a couple of\ntimes, making sure that you go, all right,\n\n677\n00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.020\nI've got that covered, everything\nsounds good, and I am ready to go.\n\n678\n00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.330\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode then.\n\n679\n00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.352\nSigning off for ITProTV, go ahead.\n\n680\n00:32:26.352 --> 00:32:28.744\n>> [LAUGH] Did you mention\npassive interface?\n\n681\n00:32:28.744 --> 00:32:29.451\n>> I did not, no.\n\n682\n00:32:29.451 --> 00:32:30.707\n>> I know what you were\nsaying was riveting, but\n\n683\n00:32:30.707 --> 00:32:31.970\nI really wasn't listening, I'm sorry.\n\n684\n00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.830\n>> No, I did not.\n>> This guy's riveting, but\n\n685\n00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.950\nI just wasn't there.\n\n686\n00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.660\nMention the passive interface.\n\n687\n00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.330\n>> Don't forget, yes, in our summary here,\nwe also talked about the idea of\n\n688\n00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:44.800\nthe passive interface, right, that will\nallow the idea of routing protocols to go\n\n689\n00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.840\non, but without you advertising out\nthat routing protocol on the interface.\n\n690\n00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.639\nAnd that may cause some issues at times,\nespecially when routing, but\n\n691\n00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:56.944\nit also helps so that you're not actually\nadvertising out a lot of information on\n\n692\n00:32:56.944 --> 00:32:59.752\na interface that doesn't\nneed it out there as well.\n\n693\n00:32:59.752 --> 00:33:02.910\n>> And, how can I tell if I have it set\non interface, if I can't do a show run?\n\n694\n00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:06.570\n>> All right, yes, you have to be able to\nuse the show command, the show protocols.\n\n695\n00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.190\n>> Show IP protocols.\n\n696\n00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.050\n>> IP protocols.\n\n697\n00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.691\n>> Show IP protocols is your friend.\n\n698\n00:33:09.691 --> 00:33:12.876\nI'm telling you, I know Cisco's\ngonna put that on the objectives.\n\n699\n00:33:12.876 --> 00:33:13.515\nWhere?\n\n700\n00:33:13.515 --> 00:33:15.905\nWell, check out what my\npublisher brought me today.\n\n701\n00:33:15.905 --> 00:33:18.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, walked into the studio.\n\n702\n00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.810\n>> Nice.\n>> Yes, on amazon.com,\n\n703\n00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.171\nyou too can have this beautiful book.\n\n704\n00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:24.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Only $39.95.\n\n705\n00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.123\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll tell you what,\n\n706\n00:33:26.123 --> 00:33:27.810\nlet's do another lab.\n\n707\n00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.805\nEveryone out there,\nget your credit card out.\n\n708\n00:33:29.805 --> 00:33:31.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's do the lab together.\n\n709\n00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.830\nGo out to Amazon.\n\n710\n00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.110\nWhat do you say guys?\n\n711\n00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Come on.\n\n712\n00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.830\n>> So do check out Todd's book.\n\n713\n00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.233\nI don't think I need to say that again.\n\n714\n00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.392\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But apparently it's on Amazon.\n\n715\n00:33:41.392 --> 00:33:46.590\nSo do check out Todd's new book on that\nas we bring this episode to a close.\n\n716\n00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.870\nOnce again, my name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n717\n00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.290\n>> And we're gonna go to lunch,\ncuz this body needs fuel, baby.\n\n718\n00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.580\nAll right, we will come back and\n\n719\n00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.290\nwe're gonna do some switching and\ninter-VLAN routing, so stick around.\n\n720\n00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.316\nAnd my name's Todd Lammle.\n\n721\n00:33:58.316 --> 00:34:03.016\n>> [LAUGH] Stay tuned right here for\nmore CCENT content.\n\n722\n00:34:03.016 -->

exam.\n\n5\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.580\nAnd in our studios today, we have Mr.\nTodd Lammle to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.260\nTodd, welcome back to our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.740\n>> Fantastic, I hope that you guys\nenjoyed the subnetting section.\n\n8\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.380\nIf you haven't done that,\nrun back to those last two episodes and\n\n9\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.710\npractice doing that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.455\nWatch me making fun of Ronnie\ntrying to count by 16s right.\n\n11\n00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.140\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n12\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.810\n>> But the key was,\nmaybe I was picking on him, but\n\n13\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.030\nthe thing is no count by 16s,\nno seasent right, bottom line.\n\n14\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.240\nAll right, so no subnetting no seasent.\n\n15\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.680\nAnd how fast do we have to subnet for\nthe seasent?\n\n16\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.810\n>> On the spot.\n\n17\n00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.060\n>> In zero seconds, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.080\nSo no count by size, get it done.\n\n19\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.460\nNow we're gonna do the same thing,\nthough, so\n\n20\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.240\nwe're gonna keep with those block sizes.\n\n21\n00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.080\nWe're gonna head into VLSM and\nsummarization, but wait.\n\n22\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.340\nIf you guys look at the new objectives,\nthey don't have anything for\n\n23\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.980\nsummarization.\n\n24\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.900\nThey didn't have anything for\nsummarization in the last either.\n\n25\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.660\nHowever on every exam I took I\nhad summarization questions, and\n\n26\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.790\nall of my students had\nsummarization questions.\n\n27\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.942\nSo if you don't wanna watch it cuz it's\nnot in the objectives, that's completely\n\n28\n00:01:17.942 --> 00:01:20.658\nup to you, but we're gonna watch it,\nRonnie, and we're gonna do it.\n\n29\n00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:24.582\nSo VLSM guys, Variable Link Subnet Masks.\n\n30\n00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:26.670\nWhat are they and what do we use?\n\n31\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.610\nNow, first off we have to have\na routing protocol that supports VLSM,\n\n32\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.960\nso we'll talk about that classes.\n\n33\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.050\nAnd we discussed a little bit yesterday\nin an earlier episode about classful and\n\n34\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.190\nclassless, but\nwe'll do it again right now.\n\n35\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.900\nSo VLSM allows us to put\ndifferent length masks,\n\n36\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.100\nVariable Length Subnet Masks,\non a router interface.\n\n37\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.190\nThat allows us to add just\nthe amount of hosts needed for\n\n38\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.400\nthat LAN segment to save address space.\n\n39\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.320\nThis doesn't make my network\nmore efficient, run better, or\n\n40\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.270\nanything like that.\n\n41\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.460\nIt saves address space, right?\n\n42\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.975\nThat's all it was meant for.\n\n43\n00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:02.849\nUses different mass and\ndifferent segments in the network,\n\n44\n00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.850\nthis is considered classless.\n\n45\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.340\nAll right, so\nlet me give you the difference here.\n\n46\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.810\nLet's just pick on something simple,\nlike RIP, right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.520\nSo if I had RIP version 1, so\nlet's go up here for a second.\n\n48\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.270\nSo, oops, not that one this one.\n\n49\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.970\nIf I had RIP version 1, and we're\ngonna get to IP sometime later today.\n\n50\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.280\nBut the point is that it\nsends out a network address,\n\n51\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.996\na network advertisement like this.\n\n52\n00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.677\n192.168.10.0.\n\n53\n00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:41.200\nSo basically this router here says,\nhey, all of 192 and\n\n54\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.850\n68.10.0 is over here, come and get it.\n\n55\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.740\nThe problem is that's not the case, we're\ngoing to subnet that fourth octet, we're\n\n56\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.590\ngoing to have 16 subnets with a slash 28,\nand we can have them all over our network.\n\n57\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.960\nSo, we can't run a classful,\nthis is classful, right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.635\nThe other thing it might advertise\nto give you a better example here,\n\n59\n00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:04.850\n10.0.0.0 if it was class\nA would advertise,\n\n60\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.280\nhey all of network 10 is over here, that's\na classful network addressing, right?\n\n61\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.920\nSo, if I just go to RIPv2 and\nwe really shouldn't use either of this,\n\n62\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.227\nthey both suck, right?\n\n63\n00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:19.527\nThe fact is, we're going to use\nRIPv2 if we have to use it,\n\n64\n00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:24.510\nand it's going to be what's considered,\nclassless.\n\n65\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.355\nSo instead of advertising 192 and\n68.10.0, we advertise this.\n\n66\n00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:36.833\n192.168.10.32, oops,\nI ran out of room here.\n\n67\n00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:41.455\nSlash 28, 192.168 and\nwe send the slash notation over there.\n\n68\n00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:44.200\nDon't know how come I didn't\nget my whole screen here.\n\n69\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.620\nAnyways, so we're going to\nadvertise everything here and\n\n70\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.790\nthat's considered classless, right?\n\n71\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.320\nWe send the slash notation\nwith a route update.\n\n72\n00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.340\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n73\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.250\nBut, in order to do this,\n\n74\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.740\nwe have to have a routing protocol\nthat supports this, right.\n\n75\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.750\nSo that's one of the things\nwe'll keep in mind when we get\n\n76\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.140\nto the IP routing section.\n\n77\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.510\nSo what this says is hey, I don't have\na whole class of address over here,\n\n78\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.150\nI have a piece of it,\na small piece of it, nonetheless.\n\n79\n00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.620\nSo we take a look down here,\nwe're gonna see that this is a 10 network,\n\n80\n00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.980\nit's a Class A, the /28, block size of 16.\n\n81\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.160\nThat means I have 14 hosts over here,\nright?\n\n82\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.170\nSo I probably have like,\nsix or eight hosts for growth,\n\n83\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.930\nI have up to 14 hosts too in there,\nknowing it's not gonna grow much.\n\n84\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.552\nI don't care that it's a class A because\nit's slash 28, I have a 240 mask here,\n\n85\n00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:32.813\nI have a block size 16, a fourth octet.\n\n86\n00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:36.218\nAnd this is subnet, subnet,\nand I'm in the 128 subnet, so\n\n87\n00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:40.950\njust because it's a class A, I only have\n14 hosts based on my mask, all right.\n\n88\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.959\nThat is now applied, so\nmy subnets are 129, my valid host to 142.\n\n89\n00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:50.952\nSo if I put the first one in here,\nthis would be 129 and\n\n90\n00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:55.367\neveryone would have a /28 mask and\nthen 130, 131, for 132 and so on.\n\n91\n00:04:55.367 --> 00:05:01.550\nSo it's a granular approach\nto IP addressing, all right.\n\n92\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.390\nSo that guy just needed a 14,\nlet's take a look at this guy.\n\n93\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.080\nA 10 subnet again.\n\n94\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.880\nThese 10s are tough, aren't they?\n\n95\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.210\nNot really guys!\n\n96\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.878\nSlash 27 is a block size what, Ronnie?\n\n97\n00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:12.993\n>> 32.\n\n98\n00:05:12.993 --> 00:05:13.979\n>> 32.\n\n99\n00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.075\nHe's gonna be an expert here,\ncoming up here.\n\n100\n00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:20.104\n10.1.1 is my subnet whereas\nmy network address or\n\n101\n00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:24.905\nsubnetting in the fourth octet 0.32.64,\naren't we, and\n\n102\n00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:31.730\nthe next subnet's 96, so my valid host\n65 to 94 95 is my broadcast address.\n\n103\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.510\nSo, that's about 30 hosts, right?\n\n104\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.620\nBlock size of 32, 30 hosts.\n\n105\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.032\nI'll assign this guy .65/27.\n\n106\n00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:41.333\nNow here's the deal.\n\n107\n00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:45.900\nThe mask must be the same on all\nhosts off of a router segment.\n\n108\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.500\nWe can't do different masks\non the same LAN segment.\n\n109\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.700\nSo in this case here we'd\nhave a switch out here and\n\n110\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.918\neveryone would have a slash 27.\n\n111\n00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:54.570\nWe put in these different masks,\n\n112\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.130\nthese variable lengths on\na router interface, right?\n\n113\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.940\nNow, up here, we can see, this one's,\nthese are pretty simple, guys.\n\n114\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.710\nAnd we talked about this yesterday.\n\n115\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.200\nThe slash 30 gives us only two hosts.\n\n116\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.100\nSo, this is 12, so this will be .13 .14,\nand these are pretty easy to see.\n\n117\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.283\nWhen you see the subnet, then it's\njust .9 .10, knowing my broadcast 11.\n\n118\n00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:15.596\nSo a block size of four.\n\n119\n00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:18.822\nSo notice now,\nI put out hardly any addresses, but\n\n120\n00:06:18.822 --> 00:06:23.849\nif I had to use a Class C address in this\nexample or, I'm sorry, we had a Class A,\n\n121\n00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:28.430\nbut we subnetted in the fourth octet,\nto use a mask and all this.\n\n122\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.240\nI'd have to have a minimum of a block\nsize of 16 on every interface here.\n\n123\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.290\nOr I'm sorry, no, not that.\n\n124\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.500\n30 hosts, block size of 32\non every router interface.\n\n125\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.680\nSo we'd be wasting a lot of hosts just\nbecause this guy had a bigger block size,\n\n126\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.340\nor need for a bigger block size.\n\n127\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.160\nSo what VLSM does is say, nope,\nwe're gonna hit the granular approach of\n\n128\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.730\nadding just the right amount\nof hosts per router interface.\n\n129\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.320\nSo instead of having everyone\nhaving the same block size,\n\n130\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.300\nthat's the classical approach, we are\ndoing the classless approach all right.\n\n131\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.650\nNow the way that we do this\nis we put these in a chart.\n\n132\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.250\nSo I start here and\nI say okay, at zero ten.\n\n133\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.890\nThe reason I did this I think it was the\nmid-90s I had figured out block sizes and\n\n134\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.700\nI was going around subnetting in my head.\n\n135\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.400\nI was looking like a genius there for\na while and then I can do VLSM in my head.\n\n136\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.050\nThat was easy, and\nsummarization in my head,\n\n137\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.640\njust because you know the walk sizes.\n\n138\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.860\nThat's all great and good.\n\n139\n00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.540\nBut then I started like VLSMing,\nand started implementing it.\n\n140\n00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.520\nNot writing it down.\n\n141\n00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.330\nHey, just cuz, and\nI was overlapping addresses.\n\n142\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.731\nI realized that I'd get\nduplicate addresses.\n\n143\n00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:32.613\nIt was like.\n\n144\n00:07:32.613 --> 00:07:35.249\nSo I created this chart,\nI put a 0 and a 255.\n\n145\n00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:39.475\nSo if I had something like 192.168.10.0.\n\n146\n00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.560\nAnd I'm subnetting our VLSM in the fourth\noctet with different block sizes.\n\n147\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.335\nEvery time I used a block size,\nI put it in this chart so\n\n148\n00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:48.642\nI knew, hey, that is no longer available.\n\n149\n00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:52.882\nAll right, so zero, so in this case\nhere this is a block size of 32, so\n\n150\n00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:53.887\nit goes to 31.\n\n151\n00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:56.289\nThe next one is 32,\nit's a block size of 32.\n\n152\n00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.701\nI needed a block size of 64.\n\n153\n00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:01.430\n16, 16, 8, and 4, right?\n\n154\n00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.729\nSo those are my different block sizes that\nI need based on the needs for those LANs,\n\n155\n00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:06.798\nor WAN in this case.\n\n156\n00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:10.151\nSo once I did that,\nI would put them into a chart, again, so\n\n157\n00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:14.250\nI knew that block size for\nthat network address was now used up.\n\n158\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.900\nLet's do a practice, okay, let's do this.\n\n159\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.830\nSo it'll be something like this, and\nI want to do this in both a classical and\n\n160\n00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.480\nclassical manner.\n\n161\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.880\nLet's take a look here.\n\n162\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.810\nSo, let's start with my largest one,\nthis is what I like to do.\n\n163\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.700\nOn my largest LAN, I'm gonna start here.\n\n164\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.590\nI think everyone can see that\nwe have a block size of 64.\n\n165\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.888\nAnd again, I think I put in\nhere 192.168.10.0, that's fine.\n\n166\n00:08:37.888 --> 00:08:41.854\nSo my first network,\nI'm gonna come to my chart, and\n\n167\n00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:47.068\nI'm gonna go start with a zero subnet,\n192.168 10.64.\n\n168\n00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:47.806\nOkay, it's a block.\n\n169\n00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:50.146\nI'm sorry, 10.0.\n\n170\n00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:51.186\nI wish I had an eraser on this thing.\n\n171\n00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:52.686\nI gotta talk to Apple about that.\n\n172\n00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:55.220\n10.0 with a block size of 64.\n\n173\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.850\nWhich means I have a slash what?\n\n174\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.600\n26.\n\n175\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.020\nAll right, so where would I end that?\n\n176\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.190\nI start at 0, block size 64.\n\n177\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.120\nSo, [COUGH] my valid hosts are 1 to 62,\nso that this guy .1 or\n\n178\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.480\na lot of people sometimes\nuse the last in the subnet,\n\n179\n00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.620\nsometimes a lot of people use the first\none to their subnet for the router phase.\n\n180\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.720\nIt doesn't matter as long as you stay with\nthe same, so it's easier to understand.\n\n181\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.370\nOkay?\nSo, in this case here to brought in\n\n182\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.910\neveryone here is a /26 octet.\n\n183\n00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.310\nSo, we are actually in that what?\n\n184\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.480\n63 here.\n\n185\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.120\n63, my valid host being set.\n\n186\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.320\nI put down my network and\n\n187\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.740\nbroadcast centers,\nbecause those are used too, right?\n\n188\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.540\nSo I can't start this.\n\n189\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.962\nSo the next number I can start at is 64,\n64.\n\n190\n00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:43.969\nSo in this case here, so\nI have a 64 there, so\n\n191\n00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:46.873\nI know my next subnet is\ngonna be this no matter what.\n\n192\n00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:53.875\nBut we don't know the box size yet,\nso let's go take a look at that.\n\n193\n00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:55.439\nThis is a box size of 32, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:59.740\nSo I can start at 64.\n\n195\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.570\nAnd then my valid host\nhere would be to what?\n\n196\n00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.020\nThe next increment of 32 would be 96.\n\n197\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.840\nSo, I'd end at 95 knowing that's\nmy network and broadcast address.\n\n198\n00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.310\nAnd it would be a slash what?\n\n199\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.390\n27, right?\n\n200\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.655\nSo I have a slash 27 over here.\n\n201\n00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:19.690\nSo .65, so my valid host is really 65-94.\n\n202\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:25.720\nMy broadcast of looking at this chart,\nall right, we end at 95.\n\n203\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.738\nNow just a couple more, guys.\n\n204\n00:10:27.738 --> 00:10:32.928\nI have a block size of 16 here, right, so\n\n205\n00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:39.858\nI'm gonna start at 96, 192 168.10.96.\n\n206\n00:10:39.858 --> 00:10:43.578\nAnd since I have a /16,\nI need a slash what?\n\n207\n00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:45.758\nTo get me a block size of-\n>> 28?\n\n208\n00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:47.018\n>> 28 is correct.\n\n209\n00:10:47.018 --> 00:10:49.830\nSo 97, right?\n\n210\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.040\nWhere do we add?\n\n211\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.120\nThe next increment of 16 is what?\n\n212\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.500\n112.\nSo we're in here at 111.\n\n213\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.687\nRight?\nSo 97 through 110.\n\n214\n00:10:58.687 --> 00:11:02.727\nPut like a .97 here, and everyone uses,\noops I wrote it backwards.\n\n215\n00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:06.867\n97, and everyone uses a slash 28.\n\n216\n00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:12.627\nThen I have a block size of eight,\n112 through, what?\n\n217\n00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:16.567\nSo this one's pretty easy,\nmy next increment of eight would be 120,\n\n218\n00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:18.387\nso my broadcast would be 119.\n\n219\n00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:25.767\nOkay so o 192, 168, 10.1 12/29.\n\n220\n00:11:25.767 --> 00:11:28.268\nRight and this would be .113, and\nso we'd have 113 through 118 here.\n\n221\n00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:32.840\n>> All right now so\n\n222\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.909\nwe haven't used a lot of our space here.\n\n223\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.850\nAll I need now is, looks like three WANs.\n\n224\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.920\nNow a lot of times back then what I\nused to do was start at the bottom and\n\n225\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.200\nmove up with my WANs,\nmy LANs came down this way.\n\n226\n00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.640\nThis is a way to do it.\n\n227\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.500\nIt's not necessarily, I could do 120,\n124, 128, right, that would work too.\n\n228\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.350\nSo let's do that even though,\non my answer sheet, I have it different.\n\n229\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.258\nSo this would be 120,\nmy next subnet 124, 128.\n\n230\n00:11:56.258 --> 00:12:00.660\nRight, and those are my three block\nsizes of four, so this is where I end.\n\n231\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.550\nNow, the fact is this, I've only\nused half my address space using,\n\n232\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.160\nI only use half my address space\nusing classless addressing.\n\n233\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.990\nTo say you look at this\nin a classfull manner for\n\n234\n00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.250\na second and\ntell me what we would do for here.\n\n235\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.780\nNow, when you look at something in\na classfull manner, you're saying\n\n236\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.330\nI need to find the largest block size and\nget a mass that fits at and then everyone\n\n237\n00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.810\nhas to use that I've got a class c,\nwhat's my largest block size here, Ronnie?\n\n238\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.468\n>> It's gonna be the 64.\n\n239\n00:12:27.468 --> 00:12:29.448\n>> 64, so what masks give me a 64?\n\n240\n00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:33.847\n/26 or 192.192 in the fourth octet, so\n\n241\n00:12:33.847 --> 00:12:38.150\nthat gives me four subnets\neach with 62 hosts.\n\n242\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.960\nWell, let's see.\n\n243\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.340\nSo this would be my 0 subnet,\nthat fits there.\n\n244\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:47.278\nSo it'd my 64,\nup here I'll use my 128 subnet.\n\n245\n00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:49.478\nMy screens get busy, isn't it?\n\n246\n00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:51.380\nMy 192 subnet.\n\n247\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.540\nI'm out of subnet.\n\n248\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.290\nNot only can I not finish this,\nI'm wasting a lot of space, but\n\n249\n00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.380\nI can't even do my WANs.\n\n250\n00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.310\nSo in a classful manner, can't do it.\n\n251\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.180\nIn a classless manner,\nI only use half my address space.\n\n252\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.180\nWe get an idea how we're\nsaving an address space.\n\n253\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.010\nWe're handing out in a granular passion.\n\n254\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.450\nLet's take a look at some\nseasoned objectives samples.\n\n255\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.005\nThat should spark their interest.\n\n256\n00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:17.370\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n257\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.670\nWhich VLSM mask will allow for the\nappropriate amount of hosts per number?\n\n258\n00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.700\nReally guys, this is a subnet question.\n\n259\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.960\nFirst of up here,\nwe know that it's a slash 30.\n\n260\n00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.750\nWhat would be this one down here?\n\n261\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.440\nWhat block size?\n\n262\n00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.670\nSo basically they're saying,\nwhat's the block size for each one?\n\n263\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.400\nWell on this one here, 66 hosts,\nI can't use a block size of 64.\n\n264\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.118\nWhat am I gonna use?\n\n265\n00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:36.378\nA block of what?\n\n266\n00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:37.378\n>> 128.\n\n267\n00:13:37.378 --> 00:13:40.840\n>> 128 is right, so that's a slash 25.\n\n268\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.390\nNow, uh-oh 310 hosts we are going to talk\nabout this one for a couple of minutes.\n\n269\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.680\n>> Okay.\n>> Maybe I will not run out of power\n\n270\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.605\nthis time.\n\n271\n00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:50.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe, 310 hosts check this out guys\n\n272\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.830\nif I used a, so\nI cannot even use a Class C on this one.\n\n273\n00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.610\nIf I used a Class B, check this out so\n\n274\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:02.610\nthis Class B important that\nI tell you that 285 dot 285.\n\n275\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.250\nThat's my default.\n\n276\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.165\nThe next octet is my subnet mask.\n\n277\n00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:12.150\nI'm gonna use all of these, and\nthen none in the fourth octet.\n\n278\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.510\nSo I have 8 subnet bits, so\nwhat do I have out of this?\n\n279\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.550\n256 subnets, each with 254 hosts.\n\n280\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.740\nOkay, we talked about that before.\n\n281\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.470\nThis is all subnet bits,\nthis is all host bits.\n\n282\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.880\nThis is my answer, and\nwhat that gives me if this is a class B.\n\n283\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.560\nI think we know this one, right?\n\n284\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.350\nWe use the slash 24, right?\n\n285\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:37.030\nIt's an easy subnet block,\nI sub 1, can't go wrong.\n\n286\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.630\nBut now the answer is, I need more host.\n\n287\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.290\nI need more hosts.\n\n288\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.990\nIn this example, I need more hosts.\n\n289\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.150\nSo what am I going to do?\n\n290\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.020\nI'm going to go 255.\n\n291\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.900\nThis is important, so pay attention.\n\n292\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.700\n255, 255.\nThat's my default.\n\n293\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:56.590\nSo if I want more hosts, I need to take\naway subnet bits to add more host bits.\n\n294\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.690\nSo if I was to take away subnet\nbits in that third octet,\n\n295\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.842\nwhat would be my mask now?\n\n296\n00:15:01.842 --> 00:15:02.788\n>> 254.\n\n297\n00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:08.270\n>> 254.0, so these are my subnet bits,\n\n298\n00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.818\nnow my host bits are here.here [LAUGH],\n\n299\n00:15:12.818 --> 00:15:17.150\nh.h, one in the third octet\n>> 8 there, that's 9 subnet bits,\n\n300\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.760\nthat gives me 512, 510 hosts,\nbecause I gotta minus 2 and\n\n301\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.540\nthe subnets are 7 subnet bits,\n9 host bits.\n\n302\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.260\nSo that gives me 128 subnets,\neach with the block is 512 but\n\n303\n00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.270\nwe have to minus 2 so 510 hosts.\n\n304\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.920\n>> So this is a slash twenty four,\nthis is a slash twenty three.\n\n305\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.480\nSo this is why I told you in the last\nepisode that you needed to remember this,\n\n306\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.350\nbut wait we're not done.\n\n307\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.795\nThis one said I needed more host,\n300 host.\n\n308\n00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:51.240\nWhat happens if it said,\nyou need 300 subnets?\n\n309\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.877\nNow we're gonna take the subnets and\ngo into the fourth octet,\n\n310\n00:15:53.877 --> 00:15:54.986\nwe're gonna move right.\n\n311\n00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:56.006\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n312\n00:15:56.006 --> 00:16:00.659\nSo I've got, and we're gonna do a /25 now,\nbecause it's 285 255, and\n\n313\n00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:05.230\nyou use all of here, so that's eight\nsubnet bits, this is my subnet bits.\n\n314\n00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.250\nAnd I'm gonna go into the fourth octet\nwith one bit, so I'm gonna do a 128.\n\n315\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.790\nSo now I have the opposite, and\n\n316\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.240\nremember I was telling you,\nthis is the opposite of a /23, right?\n\n317\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.006\nSo I have nine subnet bits, which gives\nme 512 subnets Each with 126 hosts.\n\n318\n00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:21.409\nRemember, you always gotta minus 2 here.\n\n319\n00:16:21.409 --> 00:16:24.763\nHere's my subnet and\nhost bits in the fourth octet.\n\n320\n00:16:24.763 --> 00:16:29.084\nYou have to understand /23, /24, /25.\n\n321\n00:16:29.084 --> 00:16:32.710\n/24 is kind of even, right?\n\n322\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.505\nSo 256 subnets equals 254 hosts.\n\n323\n00:16:35.505 --> 00:16:39.670\n/23 gives me more host bits, less subnets,\n\n324\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.060\nslash 25 gives me more subnet bets,\nless host bets.\n\n325\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.760\nYou have to be able to move that\nsubnet bets left and right.\n\n326\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.540\nOn this one here, that was really\nnot that hard of a question,\n\n327\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.260\nespecially if you understood\nwhat I just wrote down.\n\n328\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.100\nThis is exactly what you'd see for\nthe objectives here.\n\n329\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.930\nThe routers are running RIP version two.\n\n330\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.240\nMakes me want to apologize\nto them actually.\n\n331\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.410\nPoor things.\n\n332\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.860\nAll right.\n\n333\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.730\nOkay.\nSo we're looking here.\n\n334\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.600\nLet's figure this out and\nwe're gonna go around this way.\n\n335\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.630\nCheck this out.\nSo we go from left and\n\n336\n00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.065\nI come around this way doing\nmy addressee like that.\n\n337\n00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:15.360\nThat's so\nyou want to approach the objectives.\n\n338\n00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.380\nSo here, obviously guys I think you\nknow you need a block size of 64.\n\n339\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.340\nI think that's pretty obvious here.\n\n340\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.550\nI'm gonna start with 0, all right?\n\n341\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.190\nAnd a block size 64 is gonna end at 63.\n\n342\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.830\nWe know that the 0 was a subnet,\n63 is a broadcast.\n\n343\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.660\nSo your valid hosts\nthe numbers in between.\n\n344\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.620\nThat's not important here.\n\n345\n00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.490\nWhat's important is you\nunderstand your blocks.\n\n346\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.120\nNow, I need a block size of 32 here,\ndon't I?\n\n347\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.040\n>> Yes.\n\n348\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.110\n>> Okay, block size of 64,\nblock size of 32.\n\n349\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.060\nSo I end it at 63,\n\n350\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.900\nso I'm going to 64 using a block\nsize of 32 I'm going to end at?\n\n351\n00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.895\n>> 95.\n>> 95, the valid host of the numbers\n\n352\n00:17:52.895 --> 00:17:55.740\nin-between, because I'm writing down\nthe network and broadcast address.\n\n353\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.870\nAnd I'm going to do that because\nI need my whole range here.\n\n354\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.091\n12 hosts, I need a block size of 16.\n\n355\n00:18:02.091 --> 00:18:04.924\nSo, 96 to-\n>> 1.\n\n356\n00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:06.742\n>> [LAUGH] 111.\n\n357\n00:18:06.742 --> 00:18:07.640\n>> 111!\n\n358\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.458\n>> Yeah,\nnext increment of 16 is 112, right?\n\n359\n00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:10.473\n>> 112, yeah.\n\n360\n00:18:10.473 --> 00:18:11.050\n>> Okay, so you see how I'm doing this?\n\n361\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.610\nPretty simple,\nnow I just need some slash 30s.\n\n362\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.014\n>> Don't care.\n>> So I'm going to start at 112.\n\n363\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:23.950\nSo this would be .113, .114, and\nthen this would be, 115's my broadcast,\n\n364\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.914\nso subnet 116, .117, and .118.\n\n365\n00:18:27.914 --> 00:18:30.850\nBada bing, bada boom, pretty simple.\n\n366\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.400\nActually VLSM, it's just blocks,\nI'm just adding different block sizes,\n\n367\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.839\nvery straightforward.\n\n368\n00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.880\nOkay, let's do this one.\n\n369\n00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.520\nWe'll start over here.\n\n370\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.360\nWe're gonna see that\nthis one's already done.\n\n371\n00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.380\nIt says, hey you're in the zero\nsub with a block size of 32.\n\n372\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.960\nSo this goes zero through 31.\n\n373\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.480\nOkay, this guy's 32 with\na block size of 16.\n\n374\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.820\nSo this goes 33 to 47.\n\n375\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.070\nGood.\nI think I'll keep asking so\n\n376\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.005\nI don't go so fast.\n\n377\n00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:00.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> People are asking me why\n\n378\n00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.755\nare you picking on Ronnie?\n\n379\n00:19:01.755 --> 00:19:03.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well the key is if I ask him,\n\n380\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.140\nand then he asks, it kind of slows\nme down for you guys, right?\n\n381\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.860\nSo that's why I'm picking on Ronnie.\n\n382\n00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.040\nPoor Ronnie.\n\n383\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.580\nAll right, got a 48 here.\n\n384\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.330\nSo 32 to 47, so we start at 48,\nthe block size of 16.\n\n385\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.670\nWhere do I end, Ronnie?\n\n386\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.699\n>> Should end at 63.\n\n387\n00:19:20.699 --> 00:19:21.605\n>> It does end at 63.\n\n388\n00:19:21.605 --> 00:19:24.970\nSo we're looking 49.\n\n389\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.214\n>> 49 through 63.\n\n390\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.780\nYeah, 49-62, so\nit's 48 through 63 is my broadcast.\n\n391\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.550\nYeah, no, you said it right, it's fine.\n\n392\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.500\nOkay, now the answer's not here,\nRonnie, what are you gonna do?\n\n393\n00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.380\nOkay, look where you ended,\nI mean we had their answers right here, so\n\n394\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.860\nthat will give you the answer for\nthis one.\n\n395\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.394\n>> Begins at 1.64.\n\n396\n00:19:45.394 --> 00:19:48.800\n>> It does, .64 is my subnet\n>> Block size 64, what's my broadcast?\n\n397\n00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.130\n>> That would be 192?\n\n398\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.250\n191?\n\n399\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.080\n>> Okay, so 64-\n>> Wait, 127.\n\n400\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.800\n>> So block size is 64 so\nyeah always 127, right?\n\n401\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.140\nSo valid host 65 to 126.\n\n402\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.640\nRight?\n\n403\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.530\nSo that's my answer here.\n\n404\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.900\nAnd then from here I end up, so\n\n405\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.420\nI could start here with those\nsubnet 128 add then 132, right?\n\n406\n00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.160\nI don't know if I would do that there.\n\n407\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.140\nI might start at the end,\nbut doesn't really matter.\n\n408\n00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.190\nNow, VLSM practice here guys.\n\n409\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.805\nSo here's what I got.\n\n410\n00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.150\n172.31.30.0.\nCan you guys see that one?\n\n411\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.170\nThis is your subnet, with a slash 20.\n\n412\n00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.640\nSo my mask is 285.\n\n413\n00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.066\n285.\n\n414\n00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:30.670\n>> 240.\n\n415\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.668\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n416\n00:20:31.668 --> 00:20:33.340\n240.0.\n\n417\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.803\nBut really who cares?\n\n418\n00:20:34.803 --> 00:20:39.064\nBecause when I look at this,\nI need 32 hosts here, I need 60 hosts,\n\n419\n00:20:39.064 --> 00:20:41.020\n50 hosts and 16 hosts.\n\n420\n00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:47.040\nSo if I didn't even look at this,\nany of this, I said I had 172.31 and\n\n421\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.550\nI was, or I used the 30, so\nit was really a 16 in the third octet.\n\n422\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.830\nSo the fact is,\nis that we're looking kind of,\n\n423\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.980\nwe need only 32 hosts, probably gonna get\nthat host in the fourth octet here, right?\n\n424\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.550\nSo 32 hosts would be,\nnot a 240 here, that'd be a 255.,\n\n425\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.770\nmy first one would be a /27, wouldn't it?\n\n426\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:13.090\nSo I'd use 0 through 31\nIn the fourth octet.\n\n427\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.140\nZero dot 30 to 31 here.\n\n428\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.870\nAnd then here 60 hosts.\n\n429\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:23.610\nHere is the deal with starting at\nzero with a smaller block size.\n\n430\n00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.810\nThat is what I did, and that is fine.\n\n431\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.270\nBut, I need a block size of 64 next.\n\n432\n00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.530\nSo I usually look for\nmy largest block size first.\n\n433\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.669\nSo this will be a block size of 64 here,\nand I start at 0.\n\n434\n00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:38.898\nSo 0 through 63.\n\n435\n00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:43.264\nLet me try this again.\n\n436\n00:21:43.264 --> 00:21:46.824\nSo I'm gonna go,\nthis is a block size of 64 and\n\n437\n00:21:46.824 --> 00:21:51.240\nyou go 0 to 63 without\nhost 1 to 62 here Alright.\n\n438\n00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.003\nNow this one here I'm gonna block size 32.\n\n439\n00:21:53.003 --> 00:21:57.293\nNow this is why I came back and\nstarted with the larger block size,\n\n440\n00:21:57.293 --> 00:22:01.203\nbecause if I start at 32,\nnow I'm open from 32 to 64.\n\n441\n00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:03.527\nWell in this case here I could\nhave put a 16 there, but\n\n442\n00:22:03.527 --> 00:22:05.680\nI'm still gonna end up wasting space.\n\n443\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.240\nI'm not gonna go back to the 32 host.\n\n444\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.840\nNo I can because if I have 32 hosts\nrunning what's my block size?\n\n445\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.800\n32?\n\n446\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.960\nNo, because a block size of\n32 only gives me 30 hosts.\n\n447\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.175\nSo I need a block size of 64 here,\n64 here, 64 here and 32 here.\n\n448\n00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:27.170\nBecause if that said 14 hosts,\nI could use a block size 16.\n\n449\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.495\nBut it says 16 hosts, so\nI need a block size of 32.\n\n450\n00:22:31.495 --> 00:22:33.310\nSo, since I need a zero here.\n\n451\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:39.180\nSo I can actually come back here, and\nstart at 0 here, start at 64 here,\n\n452\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.520\n96, and this is going to go to 128,\nso I'll start at 128.\n\n453\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.320\n>> Shouldn't that be 128 on the third one?\n\n454\n00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.150\nAnd it should be.\n\n455\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.300\nI was just testing Ronnie here guys,\n\n456\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.110\nI'm just testing to make\nsure he's paying attention.\n\n457\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.130\nAnd then that's gonna end where-\n>> 192.\n\n458\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.680\n>> Right, so\nI'll start here with block size 32, okay.\n\n459\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.430\nSo here we'll start at zero,\nlet me write this better, 64, 128, and\n\n460\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:08.800\nthen we'll start at 192, but this is a /27\nhere and these are all /26s here, right.\n\n461\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.846\nI'm not doing these WANs,\nthese are all to size 30s.\n\n462\n00:23:15.056 --> 00:23:16.850\nOkay.\n\n463\n00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.290\nThe key is guys,\ndon't get confused on here.\n\n464\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.710\nThis is what the objectives\nwill do to you.\n\n465\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.560\nThey'll do something like 32 hosts, and\n\n466\n00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.060\nyou'll actually do a block\nsize of 32 actually.\n\n467\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.360\nAnd now that would be a mistake,\nor they do 50 hosts.\n\n468\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.110\nThat one, you might get, but 16 hosts,\nyou might only do a block size of 16.\n\n469\n00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.020\nBe very, very careful who\nwill try to confuse you here.\n\n470\n00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.700\nLet me clean this out and let me write\nthis out again, so you guys have this.\n\n471\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.570\nAll right so every single one\nof these block size of 32.\n\n472\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.641\nBlock size of 64,\nI didn't even say that right.\n\n473\n00:23:45.641 --> 00:23:49.271\nSo block size 64 must start at 0,\n\n474\n00:23:49.271 --> 00:23:54.232\ngo to 63 64 to 127, 128 to 191, and\n\n475\n00:23:54.232 --> 00:24:00.286\nthen this starts at 192, but\nit's a block size of 32.\n\n476\n00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:02.109\nSo it goes to 223.\n\n477\n00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:06.605\nAnd I wrote down the network and broadcast\naddresses, just so you understand.\n\n478\n00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:09.034\nA key is that I was trying\nto show you on here,\n\n479\n00:24:09.034 --> 00:24:12.940\ndon't get confused if they say\nthe actual block size number of hosts.\n\n480\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.150\nThat's not gonna work, you're gonna\nhave to go up to the next block size.\n\n481\n00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.150\nAll right, so what is route summarization?\n\n482\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:24.829\nNow the last one is a /27 here.\n\n483\n00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:27.049\n>> Yep.\n\n484\n00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:31.810\n>> Okay, route summarization actually\nmakes your network run better.\n\n485\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.790\nVLSM didn't make my\nnetwork really run better,\n\n486\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.210\nit made my addressing\nscheme more efficient.\n\n487\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.100\nAnd I showed you that when we did\nthe class one, classless example, right?\n\n488\n00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:47.420\nSo route summarization says,\nhey, all of 172.16 is over here.\n\n489\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.245\nThat's great,\nif you have a classful boundary, right?\n\n490\n00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:53.068\nSo I can say, hey,\nall of 10's over here 172.16.\n\n491\n00:24:53.068 --> 00:24:54.734\nGreat, if you can do it.\n\n492\n00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:59.030\nCuz I can have 10,000 subnets\nwith a Class A or something.\n\n493\n00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.020\nAdvertise those out one at a time, that's\nnot gonna make, IP's gonna have to parse\n\n494\n00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.440\nthe routing table,\nit's not gonna make it run as efficient.\n\n495\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.890\nWe'd rather say, hey,\nall of network 10 is over here,\n\n496\n00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.270\nor network 10.10.10 is over here,\nsomething that makes it more efficient.\n\n497\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.610\nAnd that's what route\nsummarization does for us.\n\n498\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.540\nSo route summarization reduces\nthe size of a route tables, right?\n\n499\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.570\nThat's what we're looking for,\nefficient route tables.\n\n500\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:21.430\nNow Cisco, and\n\n501\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.060\nthe reason I have this slide here, calls\nthis route aggregation, route aggregation.\n\n502\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.697\nAgain, I want to mention,\nno objectives on the CCENT on this one, so\n\n503\n00:25:29.697 --> 00:25:30.782\ntake your chances.\n\n504\n00:25:30.782 --> 00:25:35.163\nAll right, be careful with over\nsummarization here because what will\n\n505\n00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:39.483\nhappen here, is we're gonna\nadvertise that we're 10 over here.\n\n506\n00:25:39.483 --> 00:25:43.139\nHey, all of network 10 is over here,\nbut Bob from sales, you know how he,\n\n507\n00:25:43.139 --> 00:25:44.124\n[LAUGH] you know Bob?\n\n508\n00:25:44.124 --> 00:25:46.300\nIf you were here yesterday\nyou'll get that one.\n\n509\n00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.260\nBob is gonna go over there to add a 10\nsubnet over in the sales VLAN, right?\n\n510\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.370\nAnd he's gonna bring this network down.\n\n511\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.050\nHe's gonna cause a problem\nwith that subnet\n\n512\n00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.098\nbecause it's gonna be advertised here.\n\n513\n00:25:57.098 --> 00:26:00.785\nHey this subnet's over here, but we're\nadvertising all subnets are over here.\n\n514\n00:26:00.785 --> 00:26:04.780\nThat one subnet's not gonna be usable\nbecause it's gonna be advertising both\n\n515\n00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.010\ndirections, right?\n\n516\n00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:06.980\nOversummarization.\n\n517\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.200\nSummerization is great,\nit's extremely efficient.\n\n518\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.301\nExtremely difficult to implement\nbecause you have to have classful clean\n\n519\n00:26:16.301 --> 00:26:17.070\nboundaries.\n\n520\n00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.800\nGood luck with that one.\n\n521\n00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.200\nNow to find your summary,\nlet's get to the easy part.\n\n522\n00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.330\nNow we're looking for block size.\n\n523\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.590\nCheck this out, we're looking for\nblock sizes, but not blocks of hosts.\n\n524\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.230\nFor the last day and\na half we've been doing blocks of hosts.\n\n525\n00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.000\nNow we're gonna do blocks of what?\n\n526\n00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.672\nSubnets, blocks of subnets,\nblocks of networks, right?\n\n527\n00:26:33.672 --> 00:26:37.630\nSo we're gonna look, forget host bits,\nlet's look at blocks of networks.\n\n528\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.130\nIf you want to summarize the following\nnetworks into one network entry.\n\n529\n00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.620\nSo all of these networks\nare being advertised.\n\n530\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.890\nSo these are different class C networks.\n\n531\n00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.950\nThey're all being\nadvertised into a router.\n\n532\n00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.900\nWe want to say, no, no,\nno I don't want to advertise all\n\n533\n00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.910\nof those networks into that routing table,\nI want to advertise it as one entry.\n\n534\n00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.220\nYou can do that if it's contiguous, right?\n\n535\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.885\nSo in this case here let's look at this,\n\n536\n00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:05.575\n192.168.32.0 see if I can get\nthis Apple pen to go sideways,\n\n537\n00:27:05.575 --> 00:27:10.477\n192.168.32.0, through 63.0.\n\n538\n00:27:10.477 --> 00:27:13.250\nThat is a block of how many networks?\n\n539\n00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.220\nSo we're looking at this,\nit's just a block size of networks.\n\n540\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.090\nNow where is this block size that we\nfind interesting, where is it at?\n\n541\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.595\nIt's in the third octet, all right?\n\n542\n00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:28.300\nSo 32 through 63 is a block size of 32.\n\n543\n00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.009\n32 subnets, 32 networks in this example.\n\n544\n00:27:32.009 --> 00:27:35.920\n192.168.32.0, that's my first network.\n\n545\n00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.350\nThat's my summary address.\n\n546\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.500\nThe summary address is always\nthe first network in the range, right?\n\n547\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.880\nSo that's my address, right?\n\n548\n00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.765\nSo here's my summary address right here.\n\n549\n00:27:48.212 --> 00:27:53.101\nNow, I just need to use a mask that\ntells me I have a block of 32 networks\n\n550\n00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:55.170\nin the third octet.\n\n551\n00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.190\nWhat subnet mask can I put\nin the third octet that\n\n552\n00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:00.205\nwill tell me I have a block of 32 there?\n\n553\n00:28:00.205 --> 00:28:05.431\n>> [COUGH]\n>> Ronnie's choking over the answer.\n\n554\n00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:06.695\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n555\n00:28:06.695 --> 00:28:08.443\n>> Yes.\n>> 225.225,\n\n556\n00:28:08.443 --> 00:28:12.618\nthe third octet is a block size of 32,\ndoesn't it?\n\n557\n00:28:12.618 --> 00:28:15.474\nSo now you're like, what?\n\n558\n00:28:15.474 --> 00:28:19.130\n192.168.30, that's a class C.\n\n559\n00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.920\nCan I put 225.22,\nI have to put a 225.225.225.0, don't I?\n\n560\n00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.529\nNo you don't, not even on\nan interface it'll let you put, well,\n\n561\n00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:29.471\ncertainly Microsoft will let you.\n\n562\n00:28:29.471 --> 00:28:33.266\nCisco will let you on most iOS', but\nnot all, put in any mask, right?\n\n563\n00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:36.965\nBut the fact is, is my summary\naddress would look like this and\n\n564\n00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:41.959\nit's a special command, as you're not\nsaying IP address in the address, right?\n\n565\n00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:46.597\n2.168 32.0,\nthat's my first one in the range.\n\n566\n00:28:46.597 --> 00:28:49.215\nSo, I'm saying, hey,\nfrom this starting point, and\n\n567\n00:28:49.215 --> 00:28:51.010\nit has to be at a contiguous boundary.\n\n568\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:57.260\nWith a block size of 32, so\n\n569\n00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:03.740\nthis 224 is saying I have a block size\nof 32 there, so advertised to 63.\n\n570\n00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.040\nAgain, we're gonna use a special command.\n\n571\n00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.350\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n572\n00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.057\nNow, first we'll summarize\nthese examples and\n\n573\n00:29:08.057 --> 00:29:09.523\nI'll show you how to put it on interface.\n\n574\n00:29:09.523 --> 00:29:16.666\nNetworks 192.168.64.0 through 95.0, okay?\n\n575\n00:29:16.666 --> 00:29:19.350\nRonnie, what do you think\nthat block size is?\n\n576\n00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.966\n>> That's one is gonna be 32?\n\n577\n00:29:22.966 --> 00:29:25.751\nYeah, 32.\n\n578\n00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:26.874\n>> Yeah, it's 32.\n\n579\n00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.190\nOkay, so I'm gonna type in the IP summary\naddress, the first one in the range.\n\n580\n00:29:34.297 --> 00:29:36.875\nAnd on the same line would\nbe a contiguous mask,\n\n581\n00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:39.720\nright, not an inverse mask,\na regular mask.\n\n582\n00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.990\nBut I'll just write it underneath here.\n\n583\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.567\nAnd what tells me I have a block\nof 32 in the third octet?\n\n584\n00:29:44.567 --> 00:29:45.220\n>> 224.\n\n585\n00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.650\n>> 224.0, and that's my summary.\n\n586\n00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.917\nAnd now I'm advertising all 32 subnets,\nall 32 networks,\n\n587\n00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:54.532\nas one entry into my neighbor routers.\n\n588\n00:29:56.866 --> 00:30:00.427\n192.168.48.0 through 63.0.\n\n589\n00:30:00.427 --> 00:30:03.029\n>> 16.\n\n590\n00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:05.980\n>> That is a block of 16 in my\nfirst network in the range.\n\n591\n00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.391\nIP summary address 192.68.48.0, so\n\n592\n00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.909\nmy mask is gonna be 285.285.240.0.\n\n593\n00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:16.940\nOkay, block size of 16 and a third octet.\n\n594\n00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.523\nAnd then, the last one, example, and\n\n595\n00:30:20.523 --> 00:30:23.996\nthen we're going through some CCENT\nexamples coming up in the next slides.\n\n596\n00:30:23.996 --> 00:30:28.551\n192.168.80.0 through 87.0.\n\n597\n00:30:28.551 --> 00:30:29.324\n>> 8.\n\n598\n00:30:29.324 --> 00:30:34.402\n>> It's a block size of 8 so\nI'm gonna put a 255.255.248.0.\n\n599\n00:30:34.402 --> 00:30:40.850\nNow here's the command that'll look\nlike if I was on some core this is my,\n\n600\n00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:45.122\ncorporate network and\nI'm going out of my core.\n\n601\n00:30:45.122 --> 00:30:46.710\nI'd put it here, right?\n\n602\n00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.914\nSo if this is gig 00.\n\n603\n00:30:50.914 --> 00:30:53.939\nSo I'd say Int g 0/0,\n\n604\n00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:58.700\nip summary-address ripv2 or EIGRP.\n\n605\n00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.325\nNow OSPF uses a different command.\n\n606\n00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:04.476\n192.168.80.0 255.255.248.0,\n\n607\n00:31:04.476 --> 00:31:09.850\nthat's gonna advertise all 8 networks out,\ngig 0/0, as one entry.\n\n608\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.400\nRight, so my neighbors only see one entry.\n\n609\n00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.210\nLet's take a look at some CCENT examples,\nokay?\n\n610\n00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.135\nTime to get off that phone call or\nstop doing your emails for a second.\n\n611\n00:31:18.135 --> 00:31:20.680\nNow this one's kind of simple.\n\n612\n00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.040\nTo be honest with you, these summary\nexamples can be somewhat simple,\n\n613\n00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.784\nit just depends on how you look at it.\n\n614\n00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:30.374\n192.168.144.0/20.\n\n615\n00:31:30.374 --> 00:31:33.111\n144.0/20.\n\n616\n00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:38.448\nOkay, so basically they're\ngiving me the summary address.\n\n617\n00:31:38.448 --> 00:31:41.812\nThe funny thing is, guys, if they're\ngiving you the summary address here,\n\n618\n00:31:41.812 --> 00:31:43.329\nnow it's just a subnet question.\n\n619\n00:31:43.329 --> 00:31:49.059\nRemember, when you're doing the CCNA,\nevery question is a subnet question.\n\n620\n00:31:49.059 --> 00:31:51.508\nOr even if we got into access lists,\nwhich we're gonna do.\n\n621\n00:31:51.508 --> 00:31:55.293\nEven when we get into OSPF Every\nquestion's a subnet question because if\n\n622\n00:31:55.293 --> 00:31:58.470\nyou can't subnet,\nthen you can't build your access list.\n\n623\n00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:03.760\nYou can't do VLSM, you can't summarize,\nyou can't do OSP off inverse mass.\n\n624\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.180\nYou have to be able to subnet first.\n\n625\n00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.710\nSo this being said,\nhere we are in a summary question, and\n\n626\n00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.100\nnow we're just looking at it as a subnet.\n\n627\n00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.350\nI'm just gonna come down here.\n\n628\n00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.729\nI don't even need to look at the question,\nright.\n\n629\n00:32:16.729 --> 00:32:18.734\nA /20, let's write out the mask.\n\n630\n00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:23.720\n>> 255.255.240.0.\n\n631\n00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.250\n>> Which is a block size 16 so\nI'm in the 144.0 subnet.\n\n632\n00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.920\nRonnie, what's the next subnet?\n\n633\n00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.818\n>> Should be 160.\n\n634\n00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:35.872\n>> It is, 160.0, which means my\nbroadcast address would be 159.255.\n\n635\n00:32:35.872 --> 00:32:40.675\nSo if they said hey which addresses would\nbe forwarded, from r2 that receives\n\n636\n00:32:40.675 --> 00:32:45.770\na summary, I just gotta go through now\nthe options and pick out the valid host.\n\n637\n00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.130\nAnd the question really is this,\ncan you pick out the answers,\n\n638\n00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:52.575\ncan you pick out the numbers\nbetween 144.0 and 159.255?\n\n639\n00:32:52.575 --> 00:32:54.510\nThat's the question.\n\n640\n00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.020\nCan you pick out those numbers?\n\n641\n00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.440\nThat's all it is, ding ding ding next.\n\n642\n00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.120\nBut you just have to get\nto this point don't you?\n\n643\n00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.110\nNo big deal.\n\n644\n00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:07.390\nAgain summary question, just a subnet\nquestion, pick out the valid host, okay.\n\n645\n00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.120\nPretty simple right?\n\n646\n00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.390\nLet's look at another one.\n\n647\n00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.476\nLook so close I'm not even\ngonna look at the question.\n\n648\n00:33:14.476 --> 00:33:20.293\n172.31.80.0/20, again 255,\n\n649\n00:33:20.293 --> 00:33:23.003\n255, 240.0.\n\n650\n00:33:23.003 --> 00:33:29.296\nOkay so 80.0 is my subnet so\nthat makes next my subnet what?\n\n651\n00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:30.364\n>> 96?\n\n652\n00:33:30.364 --> 00:33:34.922\n>> 96.0, so\nmy broadcast address would be 95.255.\n\n653\n00:33:34.922 --> 00:33:38.220\nAgain, can you pick out the numbers\nfrom between these two numbers?\n\n654\n00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.950\nThat's your answer.\n\n655\n00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.617\nWhat are the valid hosts between 80.0 and\n95.255?\n\n656\n00:33:43.617 --> 00:33:47.218\nThat summary,\na very quick easy subnet isn't it?\n\n657\n00:33:47.218 --> 00:33:50.850\nI kinda slowed down a little bit\nif I could, I was trying to!\n\n658\n00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.160\nNow we have two summary questions here.\n\n659\n00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.075\nNow instead of getting the summary,\nwe have to create the summary.\n\n660\n00:34:00.036 --> 00:34:02.002\nNow you have to look at these LANs, and\n\n661\n00:34:02.002 --> 00:34:05.270\ndetermine what your summary\naddress that you're gonna send.\n\n662\n00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.060\nWe'll say this is router B.\n\n663\n00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:12.160\nWhat are you gonna put in A to\nsummarize these networks to router B?\n\n664\n00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.770\nPretty simple really, only a few networks,\nbut welcome to the objectives.\n\n665\n00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.143\nIP summary address and we'll use RIP.\n\n666\n00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:24.437\nRipv2.\n\n667\n00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:28.431\nWhat do you think, Ronnie,\nwhat's my network address?\n\n668\n00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:31.449\n>> 10.0.0?\n\n669\n00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.370\n>> It is 0.0, and here's why guys.\n\n670\n00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.550\nSo, if we look at this, we're gonna start\nat the first part of the contiguous block.\n\n671\n00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.510\nAnd what's interesting here,\nnot the first octet, not the second one.\n\n672\n00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.550\nCuz if we just did, hey 10.0 right?\n\n673\n00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.430\nThat's my summary, it might be a little\neasy, so we have to look in the third\n\n674\n00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.625\noctet for a second, and find that that's\ninteresting, and why is it interesting?\n\n675\n00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:56.429\n0, 1, 3, so basically, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1,\n\n676\n00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:00.270\n2, 3, that's a contiguous block of four.\n\n677\n00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.830\nSo I have a block size of four\nin the third octet, all right?\n\n678\n00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.660\nSo that's interesting to me.\n\n679\n00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:11.610\nSo, 10.0.0.0, because this is the first\nnetwork in my range, the zero.\n\n680\n00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:16.170\nWhat's my mask gonna be to tell me I have\na block size of four in the third octet?\n\n681\n00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.216\n>> 252.\n\n682\n00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:19.352\n>> 252.0.\n\n683\n00:35:19.352 --> 00:35:20.652\nThat is the answer.\n\n684\n00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:21.710\nLet's do that one again.\n\n685\n00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.900\nNow, it's slightly different here, okay?\n\n686\n00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:34.844\nSo what do you think, Ronnie, if we\njust go 10.4.0.0/24 or something, /16?\n\n687\n00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:39.380\nSomething big and broad,\nnot good enough for the objectives.\n\n688\n00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.350\nThe answer, very well probably,\nis 10.4.0.0, right, but\n\n689\n00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.330\nwhat's my interesting octet?\n\n690\n00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.900\nAgain, the third octet.\n\n691\n00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.020\nI have a zero, one, and\nthey don't have a two in here,\n\n692\n00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.210\nbut we're gonna put that\nin size the block size.\n\n693\n00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.810\nSo, we're gonna start at zero.\n\n694\n00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.896\nAnd again, what mask is that?\n\n695\n00:35:58.896 --> 00:35:59.485\n>> Wouldn't it be the same?\n\n696\n00:35:59.485 --> 00:36:03.130\n>> 285, 285, 2.0, which is a slash what?\n\n697\n00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.440\n>> 22.\n\n698\n00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.920\n>> That's right, okay?\n\n699\n00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.950\nThat's your answer.\n\n700\n00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.060\nLet's take a look at just\na couple other ones guys.\n\n701\n00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.320\nWe're almost done.\n\n702\n00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.940\nOkay so, oops, my networks didn't show up.\n\n703\n00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.785\nNo.\nWell let me make them up for you.\n\n704\n00:36:16.785 --> 00:36:19.630\n[LAUGH] I didn't notice\nthey didn't copy over.\n\n705\n00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.201\nWhat do I put here?\n\n706\n00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:26.867\n1.0, it kinda would be the same thing,\n\n707\n00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:32.192\n2.0, 172.16, 3.0, and 4.0.\n\n708\n00:36:32.192 --> 00:36:33.562\nCan I do that?\n\n709\n00:36:33.562 --> 00:36:35.173\nLet me do this, 5.0.\n\n710\n00:36:35.173 --> 00:36:38.553\nLet me throw a little monkey\nwrench in here for you.\n\n711\n00:36:38.553 --> 00:36:44.062\nThese are all 172.16 1.0,\n2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0.\n\n712\n00:36:44.062 --> 00:36:44.643\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n713\n00:36:44.643 --> 00:36:47.197\nI can't do this in a block of four.\n\n714\n00:36:47.197 --> 00:36:48.358\nJust kind of ad-libbing here, baby.\n\n715\n00:36:48.358 --> 00:36:51.353\n[LAUGH] All right what do you guys think?\n\n716\n00:36:51.353 --> 00:36:53.327\nWhat block size would you use?\n\n717\n00:36:53.327 --> 00:36:54.465\nYou can't use four.\n\n718\n00:36:54.465 --> 00:36:55.904\n>> You gonna go to eight?\n>> Eight.\n\n719\n00:36:55.904 --> 00:37:02.145\nSo again I'm gonna be sitting here,\n172.16.0.0 for sure.\n\n720\n00:37:02.145 --> 00:37:05.170\nBecause I can't start at one\nto start a continuous block.\n\n721\n00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.930\nEven if I'm going to use block size\nof eight, it has to start at zero, or\n\n722\n00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.780\nmy next one starts at eight.\n\n723\n00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.210\nIf I was using a four,\nI'd start at zero and start at four.\n\n724\n00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.930\nSo, in this case here, I'm gonna start at\nzero in the third octet, and go to what?\n\n725\n00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.180\nSeven, right?\n\n726\n00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.790\nSo, and how do I tell it that\nit's a block size of eight here?\n\n727\n00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.470\nWhat do you think?\n\n728\n00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.883\nWhat's the mask that tells me how block-\n>> 248?\n\n729\n00:37:24.883 --> 00:37:28.110\n>> 248, which is a block slash what?\n\n730\n00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.038\n>> That's gonna be a /20?\n\n731\n00:37:30.038 --> 00:37:30.990\n>> 21.\n>> 21.\n\n732\n00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.410\n>> Okay?\n\n733\n00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:39.760\nSo, I use a bigger block size to use a\nlarger, cover a larger amount of networks.\n\n734\n00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.090\nOne last question, guys, or\ntwo more questions, okay.\n\n735\n00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.250\nThis is one of my favorite\nsummary questions.\n\n736\n00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.850\nBecause basically, we're in router B here.\n\n737\n00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.570\nSo this is router B, so\nhere I am right here, router B.\n\n738\n00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.940\nAnd router A over here is\nsending a summary over to.\n\n739\n00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.750\nNot sending a summary.\n\n740\n00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.000\nSending all these networks.\n\n741\n00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.680\nNow the D stands for dual,\nwhich means that we're running EIGRP.\n\n742\n00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.170\nSo no big deal.\n\n743\n00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.090\nBut my summary network statement\nwould say something like this.\n\n744\n00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.822\nIP summary address.\n\n745\n00:38:13.347 --> 00:38:17.626\nEIGRP and the autonomous system,\nwhich we'll go over in ICND2.\n\n746\n00:38:17.626 --> 00:38:21.449\nAnd then the network and\nmask for my network.\n\n747\n00:38:21.449 --> 00:38:22.760\nSo let's figure out the network and mask.\n\n748\n00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.420\nSo what do we have here, Ronnie?\n\n749\n00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.480\nWe have, it looks like four subnets\nbeing advertised from A to B.\n\n750\n00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.620\nHow do we get those with\none entry from A to B?\n\n751\n00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.630\nSo what do I type into A?\n\n752\n00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.510\nSo here's A over here, right?\n\n753\n00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.560\nSo I'm typing into A over here under\nthe interface IP summary address EIGRP.\n\n754\n00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.150\nWhat's my network and summary address?\n\n755\n00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.450\nWell, it's gonna be\nthe first one in the range.\n\n756\n00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:48.046\nSo my network's gonna be 192.168.25 what?\n\n757\n00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:49.323\n>> 16?\n\n758\n00:38:49.323 --> 00:38:53.290\n>> He's right,\nit is because the first one in the range.\n\n759\n00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:58.690\nSo, if we're doing a 16 and\nif we look at these, it says 0/30s,\n\n760\n00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.280\n16, 20, 24, 28,\nit ends up 31 as a contiguous block of 16.\n\n761\n00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.716\nSo, we'll start at the first one,\nwhich in this case, 25.16, and\n\n762\n00:39:07.716 --> 00:39:13.880\nuse a slash what to tell it that it's\na block size 16 in the fourth octet?\n\n763\n00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.610\nA slash 28.\n\n764\n00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.234\nSo that's my answer there.\n\n765\n00:39:16.234 --> 00:39:20.750\n192.168.25.16 slash 28\nwould give me a summary.\n\n766\n00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.040\nSo this guy's gonna\nadvertise that over there.\n\n767\n00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.740\nAnd router B doesn't see it as a summary,\nit sees it as just a big subnet, right?\n\n768\n00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.510\nIt sees it as a block size 16.\n\n769\n00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.830\nVery nice, very efficient.\n\n770\n00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.423\nOne last thing.\n\n771\n00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.262\nWhat address range efficiently summarize\nthe router table of the addresses for\n\n772\n00:39:36.262 --> 00:39:37.298\nthe router Main here?\n\n773\n00:39:37.298 --> 00:39:41.170\nSo if we look at this,\nkinda hard for me to get it bigger.\n\n774\n00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.958\nBut I'm looking at all of my networks\nhere, so let's start over here.\n\n775\n00:39:44.958 --> 00:39:49.240\nWe got a 1.0, 2, 3, 4, you got a 9, 10,\n\n776\n00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.956\nwe got a 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, right?\n\n777\n00:39:53.956 --> 00:39:59.067\nSo if I'm looking at this, 1, 2,\n3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.\n\n778\n00:39:59.067 --> 00:40:01.756\nI think,\nif we guys can look kind of close here,\n\n779\n00:40:01.756 --> 00:40:05.270\nwe're gonna say we have\na block size of 16, 172.16.\n\n780\n00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.220\nSo where would we start Ronnie?\n\n781\n00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:12.520\nSo would I start at 1.0\nbecause that's my lowest one?\n\n782\n00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.560\n>> 0.\n\n783\n00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.000\n>> Yeah,\nyou have to start at 0.0 in this case.\n\n784\n00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.090\nThe third octet is 0, so\nfourth octet would be 0.\n\n785\n00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:23.918\nSo now, I've got a 1, 2, 3,\n4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, we\n\n786\n00:40:23.918 --> 00:40:28.840\nare missing some networks but we're still\ngonna find a continuous block of what?\n\n787\n00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.530\n16 in the third octet.\n\n788\n00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.150\nSo what mask do I put in the third octet?\n\n789\n00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.845\nWhat's my subnet mask now?\n\n790\n00:40:34.845 --> 00:40:36.100\n>> 240.\n\n791\n00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.415\n>> Yes, and that's a slash, what?\n\n792\n00:40:37.415 --> 00:40:38.863\n>> 20.\n\n793\n00:40:38.863 --> 00:40:39.490\n>> 20, stop.\n\n794\n00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.230\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n795\n00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.280\n>> 20, right?\n\n796\n00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.768\nMy summary address from\nrouter main is 172.16.0.0/20.\n\n797\n00:40:46.768 --> 00:40:49.021\nBlock size 16 in the third octet.\n\n798\n00:40:49.021 --> 00:40:54.530\nAll right guys, summarization, I'm gonna\nmention it for the third and last time.\n\n799\n00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.730\nSummarization is not on the objectives.\n\n800\n00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.530\nEvery time that I've taken the exam,\nor anyone else I know,\n\n801\n00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:04.268\nyou get summary questions, so\nit's completely up to you.\n\n802\n00:41:04.268 --> 00:41:06.830\nNow, VLSM, oops.\n\n803\n00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.372\nIf you are studying on\nmy website Lammle.com,\n\n804\n00:41:10.372 --> 00:41:14.860\nLammle.com/ccna, practice questions and\nwe're now doing the VLSM.\n\n805\n00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.805\nSo we've done what so far on there?\n\n806\n00:41:16.805 --> 00:41:21.820\nInternetworking, TCIP, OSI, subnetting and\n\n807\n00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.110\nVLSM and summarization,\ninside there will be summarization.\n\n808\n00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.906\nIf you follow along in my new book,\nwe're gonna be through Chapter 5 now.\n\n809\n00:41:28.906 --> 00:41:31.982\nSo you wanna do the written labs and\n\n810\n00:41:31.982 --> 00:41:37.200\nthe review questions through\nChapter 5 at this point.\n\n811\n00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.770\nSo if you're following\nalong with these videos,\n\n812\n00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:41.690\nthat's where we're at with my books and\npractice test questions and\n\n813\n00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.330\nyou're well on your way\nto becoming a CCENT.\n\n814\n00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.150\n>> All right, well thank you Todd for\n\n815\n00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.730\nbeing here and helping us to\nactually get a little bit more\n\n816\n00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:53.230\nfoundation in terms of route summarization\nas well as variable link subnet masking.\n\n817\n00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.849\nThese particular types of skills, right,\n\n818\n00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:59.259\nare really gonna be helpful\nwhen it comes out to the exam.\n\n819\n00:41:59.259 --> 00:42:03.773\nBecause, like Todd said, you may not\nactually see it on the official exam but\n\n820\n00:42:03.773 --> 00:42:07.799\nyou tend to get the idea here, especially\nfrom people who've taken the exam,\n\n821\n00:42:07.799 --> 00:42:09.760\nthat you will find questions on them.\n\n822\n00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.270\nAnd if you're not familiar with\nthe concept, it's a great thing for\n\n823\n00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:14.030\nyou to become familiar with as well.\n\n824\n00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.830\nMake sure you go back through and\nunderstand those basic concepts too.\n\n825\n00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.330\nWell, that's a great place for us to\nalso go ahead and end this episode then.\n\n826\n00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.360\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n827\n00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.710\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n828\n00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:30.127\n>> And stay tuned right here for\nmore CCENT content.\n\n829\n00:42:30.127 --> 00:42:37.820\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

He explains the difference between the standard and extended access lists as well as named ACLs.  He discusses the basics of where access lists are applied and how to configure them with the most specific filtering statements first then more generic statements toward the bottom of the list.  He emphasizes that ACLs use inverse masks and not subnet masks.  Todd demonstrates creating and applying the act on a router’s interface and VTY lines using access-list and access-class, respectively.",

00:00:20.350\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ncontinuing on with ICND1 objectives.\n\n4\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.290\nGetting ready for that new Cisco\nexam that's just been released.\n\n5\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.710\nAnd in our studios today we have Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.410\nTom Lammle to help guide us through\nthose exam objectives and those hurdles.\n\n7\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.050\nWelcome back to our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.122\n>> Thanks Ronnie, it's good to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:36.060\nWe're gonna cover security and really with\nCCENT, there's a few things we'll cover at\n\n10\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.060\nfirst to explain very simple security,\nand then it's just access lists.\n\n11\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.850\nNow the new CCENT, I gotta tell you,\nonly covers standard access lists.\n\n12\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.830\nWhich is odd, right?\n\n13\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.910\nIn ICD2 though, it covers troubleshooting\nwith extended access list but\n\n14\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.960\nthey don't cover the material in their new\ncourse of in their objectives or anything.\n\n15\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.540\nIt's just inside troubleshooting.\n\n16\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.188\nSo I'm gonna cover standard access\nlists here and access list for\n\n17\n00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:05.030\nour VTY lines, those are the big\nobjectives for the CCENT.\n\n18\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.538\nIn my book, I do cover extended access\nlists that you want to read before you tie\n\n19\n00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:10.420\ncuz that's where those are covered.\n\n20\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.580\nLet's go ahead and take a look and\n\n21\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.788\nwe'll get right started in to our\nintroduction to security here.\n\n22\n00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:19.060\nAll right so, to protect, let's go\nthrough a couple of foundational things.\n\n23\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.146\nProtect network device.\n\n24\n00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.810\nOkay, these are our CCENT objective.\n\n25\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.640\nOr use a firewall to restrict access\nfrom the outside to network devices,\n\n26\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.750\nthat's obvious.\n\n27\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.620\nNow instead of using telnet,\nwe're gonna use SSH, right?\n\n28\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.420\nAnd secure copy protocol instead of just\nclear text FTP, something like that.\n\n29\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.140\nAnd then the most important here,\nphysically secure\n\n30\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.510\nnetwork equipment from potential access\nby unauthorized individuals, right?\n\n31\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.530\nThose are our three bullet points\non why we need the security.\n\n32\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.620\nNow, the most common attack is\ntypically denial of service, right?\n\n33\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.570\nDenial of service, DoS, right?\n\n34\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.600\nThis is where a host sends a sync packet\n65,000 times, uses up all the open ports.\n\n35\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.130\nAnd then that guy is not able to\nuse that IP address again, and\n\n36\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.010\nbe able to answer on that port.\n\n37\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.730\nWe're gonna sync,\nhe sends a sync out but we never answer.\n\n38\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.790\nThat's just a basic denial of service.\n\n39\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.975\nThere's also some distributed\ndenial of service.\n\n40\n00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:20.284\nThat's more common, where I have\nthousands of hosts attacking a server.\n\n41\n00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:22.846\nIt's harder to do today on Amazon and\nstuff like that, but\n\n42\n00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:24.530\npeople do it when they get mad at them.\n\n43\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.597\nIt just takes a really\nbig coordinated effort.\n\n44\n00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:28.927\nBut with Anonymous and some of those guys,\n\n45\n00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:32.700\nthey can do a huge distributed\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n46\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.397\nNow to be able to stop that, we're gonna\nuse something called an IPS today,\n\n47\n00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.390\nintrusion prevention system.\n\n48\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.550\nWe typically don't use IDS.\n\n49\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.770\nI do know people that still\ntake their IPS systems.\n\n50\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.320\nThe Cisco Next Generation IPS,\n\n51\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.240\nNext Generation Firewall, which we call\nfire power a lot, provides all this.\n\n52\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.220\nThey put it into what's\ncalled monitor only mode, and\n\n53\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.870\nthat is really run as an IDS.\n\n54\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.670\nWe don't really even use the term\nIDS in the industry anymore, why?\n\n55\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.570\nBecause IPS now works very well,\nit's just considered a bump in the wire.\n\n56\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.420\nGives us everything that we need to\nwork in real time to stop threats.\n\n57\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.520\nHowever, if you don't take\nit out of monitor only mode,\n\n58\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.680\nyou're really just an IDS.\n\n59\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.930\nThere was that commercial in that guy's\nin the bank, and these robbers come in.\n\n60\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.490\nAnd the lady's like, what are you doing?\n\n61\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.250\nThere's a robbery.\n\n62\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.700\nHe goes well, I'm just here to tell you.\n\n63\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.570\n>> A monitoring service.\n\n64\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.160\n>> I'm just here to monitor and\ntell you if there's a robbery.\n\n65\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.865\nThere's a robbery.\n\n66\n00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it was just like\n\n67\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.540\nthat's what IDS is, useless.\n\n68\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.030\nThat guy was useless to her.\n\n69\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.250\nShe's down there getting robbed.\n\n70\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.930\nHe told her after the fact\nthey got a robbery.\n\n71\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.890\nThat's what IDS does.\n\n72\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.900\nTo me, I always thought it mocked me\nbecause I'd set it up at my customers'\n\n73\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.490\nand it would page me.\n\n74\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.870\nThat's how long ago I did this.\n\n75\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.840\nIt would page me and\nbasically tell me, hey, man.\n\n76\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.640\nI hope you updated your resume.\n\n77\n00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.390\nCuz a resume-generating\nevent just occurred.\n\n78\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.380\nI didn't do anything about it.\n\n79\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.630\nI'm just letting you know.\n\n80\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.780\nAll right, that's why we don't use IPS.\n\n81\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.350\nIPS stops in real time.\n\n82\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.590\nWhy use access control lists?\n\n83\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.820\nWell, the answer is,\nwe're going to use them today.\n\n84\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.620\nNow, we used to use them\nas our full security, but\n\n85\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.960\nwe're not gonna do that anymore.\n\n86\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.227\nWe have to have the next gen, whether\nyou're using Cisco or somebody else,\n\n87\n00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:04.871\nyou need a next generation firewall.\n\n88\n00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.038\nYou need a next generation IPS.\n\n89\n00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.240\nIt's the only way to stop.\n\n90\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.350\nCuz you're gonna get malware, which is\ngonna give you ransomware or worse.\n\n91\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.245\nAll sorts of issues.\n\n92\n00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:17.600\nAnyways, why use access control lists?\n\n93\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.169\nWell, Bob in sales is trying to get into\nthe finance department to find out how\n\n94\n00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.869\nmuch money everyone makes.\n\n95\n00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:26.570\nDon't think that people don't this,\nthey do this all the time.\n\n96\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.058\nEveryone wants to know how much\nmoney everyone else makes.\n\n97\n00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:32.124\nI mean, this is a great place for\nan access list and\n\n98\n00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:35.190\nI've done this all the time\nbecause this guy Bob,\n\n99\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.393\nthat jerk from was always trying to get\ninto finance and to get information.\n\n100\n00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.501\nIt wasn't as hard to break in back then so\n\n101\n00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:46.290\na simple access list Bob\nfrom getting into finance.\n\n102\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.730\nSo we use it for our Internet, intranet,\nright, inside stuff like that.\n\n103\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.610\nDo we use and access this on our\noutside egress, sure, we block.\n\n104\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.170\nHey no RFC 1918s coming in, none of\nour local addresses should be coming\n\n105\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.570\nin from the outside, and just, but\nit's a big picture there, right?\n\n106\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.240\nAnd it's great to have that.\n\n107\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.810\nAnd then on the inside, we can just\nmicro manage users and stuff like that.\n\n108\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.920\nThe idea is we don't really\nwant to use access lists and\n\n109\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.270\nwe'll talk about that more coming up.\n\n110\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.403\nSo here's the idea what you\nneed to remember though,\n\n111\n00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:19.898\nlet's say that I was in this router and\nI telnetted to this router here.\n\n112\n00:05:19.898 --> 00:05:22.940\nLet's say though I had an access list\nthat said blocked telnet on this that I\n\n113\n00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.500\ncouldn't telnet out of this router.\n\n114\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.660\nIt would still work because I'm\ntelnetting from that router.\n\n115\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.930\nSo it has to be passing\nthrough the router for\n\n116\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.000\nan access list to take effect, all right?\n\n117\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.280\nNot, if the traffic's generated at\nthe router, it's not gonna take effect,\n\n118\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.710\nwe can see that later.\n\n119\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.440\nNow we're gonna use some different\ntypes of access list, and\n\n120\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.830\nthey're configured two different ways.\n\n121\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.870\nThere's standard,\nwhich only, this is a total,\n\n122\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.830\nI can't even believe this\nwas the only objectives.\n\n123\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.155\nWhen I saw that, I was like,\nyou gotta be kidding me.\n\n124\n00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:52.132\nWe only filter on source,\nhaven't used these in a decade or more.\n\n125\n00:05:52.132 --> 00:05:53.569\nYou don't really want to use it.\n\n126\n00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.214\nThey're very broad.\n\n127\n00:05:55.214 --> 00:05:59.890\nIf you're the source address, block it.\n\n128\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.820\nWe only filter on source.\n\n129\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.680\nWhen we come down to extended, we filter\non source and destination, on minimum.\n\n130\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.890\nSo the minute you type in an extended\nnumber and you say I'm using an extended\n\n131\n00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.620\nnumber, it says, okay, you need to type\nin a source and a destination address.\n\n132\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.940\nOn the standard, again, are you Bob?\n\n133\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.822\nYou're denied.\n\n134\n00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:20.480\nWell, but I'm trying to go do\nsomething valid, too bad, your denied,\n\n135\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.820\nyou're Bob, you're out.\n\n136\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.610\nNow in this case here on extended,\nsource and destination,\n\n137\n00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.990\nare you Bob trying to\ngo to the finance LAN,\n\n138\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.530\nyou're denied, are you trying to go\nsomewhere else, go ahead, right?\n\n139\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.519\nSo right away that gives us an advantage,\nbut it can do more.\n\n140\n00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:36.329\nSource and destination protocols,\nthe protocol field never clear header,\n\n141\n00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.700\nport numbers at the transport layer.\n\n142\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.620\nSo you say are you Bob,\nare you trying to the finance LAN and\n\n143\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.860\nyou're trying to get to the HR server,\nor to a server and get HR information?\n\n144\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.760\nYou're permitted.\n\n145\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.300\nAre you trying to FTP into\nthe finance server to steal stuff?\n\n146\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.980\nThen you're denied.\n\n147\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.639\nWe can be very specific there, right?\n\n148\n00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.458\nSo we can let Bob still go into\nthe finance LAN and get HR information but\n\n149\n00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:00.315\nnothing else.\n\n150\n00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:03.682\nOkay, two methods used to identify,\nwe can use numbered or named,\n\n151\n00:07:03.682 --> 00:07:05.830\nwe're gonna use them both in here.\n\n152\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.630\nDidn't really use named too\nmuch in the past objectives,\n\n153\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.770\nnow we're gonna use named.\n\n154\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.310\nThey're really the same thing,\nboth of these are very simple.\n\n155\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.820\nNow let's go through some configuration\nguidelines that are important for\n\n156\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.880\nyour objectives.\n\n157\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.500\nI know we're doing some lecture and\nsome PowerPoints but hang in there and\n\n158\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.510\nwe'll get some configuration in a second.\n\n159\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.390\nStandard or\nextended indicates what can be filtered.\n\n160\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.305\nWe also have IPv6 access\nlist coming up as well.\n\n161\n00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:33.419\nNot in this section, but\nin we'll do IPv6 access list.\n\n162\n00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.365\nOnly one ACL per interface.\n\n163\n00:07:35.365 --> 00:07:38.957\nSo I don't create a bunch of ACLs.\n\n164\n00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:40.832\nAccess list 1, deny Bob.\n\n165\n00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:42.312\nAccess list 2, permit Sally.\n\n166\n00:07:42.312 --> 00:07:44.110\nAccess list 3, deny Jordan.\n\n167\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.500\nNo, access list 1,\naccess list 1, access list 1.\n\n168\n00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.019\nRight, we use the same number, create\na bunch of group statements in the same\n\n169\n00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.526\ngroup and then we apply access\nlist 1 to an interface.\n\n170\n00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:57.886\nCan only apply one per protocol\nper interface per direction.\n\n171\n00:07:57.886 --> 00:08:00.458\nThe order of statements control testing.\n\n172\n00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.445\nNow for example, this is pretty important.\n\n173\n00:08:02.445 --> 00:08:08.530\nBecause, let's say that Bob was in sales\nand I wanted to permit everyone but Bob.\n\n174\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.409\nSo if I sat there and\nsaid, access list 10.\n\n175\n00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:16.790\nWhatever, It's saying standard,\nbecause if I come back here for a second.\n\n176\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.410\nNumbered one to 99 for standard, so\n\n177\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.360\nyou're going to see me using\nthose numbers a lot, 1 to 99.\n\n178\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.030\nAccess list ten permit sales,\nif that's my first line.\n\n179\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.800\nPermit sales, okay.\n\n180\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.510\nThe next line says,\naccess list ten deny bob.\n\n181\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.590\nIs bob denied?\n\n182\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.230\nAbsolutely not, because bob\nmatches that first line, right.\n\n183\n00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.610\nSo the point is, as soon as you\nmatch a line in access list,\n\n184\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.650\nit's acted on, you're permitted or\ndenied period.\n\n185\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.890\nYou don't see the next line, so my line\nwould have to be access ten denied Bob.\n\n186\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.840\nNext line permit everybody else, right.\n\n187\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.380\nDeny Bob first and then,\npermit everything else.\n\n188\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.130\nYou also need to remember that,\nif I did this, deny Bob, deny George,\n\n189\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.620\ndeny Sally and applied it to an interface.\n\n190\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.590\nYou might as well just go\nunplug that interface,\n\n191\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.600\nbecause the next line by default,\nis denial.\n\n192\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.770\nDeny any,\n\n193\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.990\neveryone's automatically denied as soon as\nyou apply an access-list to an interface.\n\n194\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.250\nEverything is denied.\n\n195\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.840\nSo if you don't have at\nleast one permit statement,\n\n196\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.650\njust go shut down the interface,\nit would be easier, all right.\n\n197\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.410\nNow remember,\nwhen we're placing a standard access list,\n\n198\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.010\nwe're going to place it\ncloser to the destination.\n\n199\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.720\nAnd the reason why,\nif I said access list 10 deny Bob,\n\n200\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.500\nand that's a good access list.\n\n201\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.530\nI guess,\nif I put that close to the source,\n\n202\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.810\nthen Bob's stuck at home where we want Bob\nto get places but not on the finance LAN.\n\n203\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.120\nSo, I'd have to go all the way\nto the finance LAN to deny,\n\n204\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.480\nto put Bob on that interface.\n\n205\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.640\nAll right,\nif I put it closer to where he's at,\n\n206\n00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.400\nthen I'm denying him from\ngetting to the internet.\n\n207\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.880\nOr to the sales LAN where we want him\nto go, so standard, they're so limited,\n\n208\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.390\nthey're a pain.\n\n209\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.920\nYou really want extended access lists,\nbut we're going to learn standard.\n\n210\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.600\nNow to do that, we have to know\nsomething about called Inverse Masks.\n\n211\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.420\nAnd the reason they created\nthese ,Aa first you're like wow,\n\n212\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.260\nthese are really convoluted and\nit's true, they are.\n\n213\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.400\nBut we'll make them pretty simple.\n\n214\n00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.180\nBut the reason they created these,\n\n215\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.950\nbecause if you remember when we\nwere doing the subnetting episodes.\n\n216\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.800\nIf you saw those, I was talking about\nhow you couldn't skip bits, and\n\n217\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.450\nthat way the answers never change.\n\n218\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.250\nBy not skipping bits, it helped us.\n\n219\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.560\nWe were able to subnet VLSM and summarize\nin our head quickly and efficiently.\n\n220\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.617\nNow, you might want to have had to\nwatch the episode a couple times.\n\n221\n00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:23.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To get that far, but\n\n222\n00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.230\nnonetheless you could have done that.\n\n223\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.590\nSo in this case here, they said no,\nwe're goin to do Inverse Masks, so\n\n224\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.440\nwe can actually skip bits.\n\n225\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.236\nThis thing gets really\ncomplicated really fast.\n\n226\n00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:34.410\nWe're not going to get anywhere near that.\n\n227\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.980\nNeither does the CCNA or\nNP exams in any way, shape or form,\n\n228\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.330\ndo they do a lot of Inverse Masking.\n\n229\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.980\nNow in this case here,\na zero means match that octet exactly.\n\n230\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.600\nSo when I enter an IP address\ninto an axisless line,\n\n231\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.700\nI have to put a mask in, an Inverse Mask.\n\n232\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.110\nIf I put a zero in, I'm saying I want\nyou to match that octet exactly.\n\n233\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.230\nSo in this case here, if I said zero,\nthis octet much match exactly, zero,\n\n234\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.690\nmatch exactly, match exactly,\nmatch exactly.\n\n235\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.480\nSo when I said access list 10 deny,\n172 16.29.0.0.0.\n\n236\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:14.370\nI'm saying it has to match that exactly,\nall four quartets.\n\n237\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.069\nIf I wanted to do this,\naccess those 10 permit 172.16.10.0,\n\n238\n00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:21.450\nmatch the first three octets exactly.\n\n239\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.970\nSo, I'm just going to look for anything\nthing that starts with 172.16.10.0.\n\n240\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.210\nAnd the last octet with\na 285 could be any value.\n\n241\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.290\nSo, the first three octets match exactly.\n\n242\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.800\nThe fourth octet can be any value.\n\n243\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.920\nNow, let's take a look\na little bit deeper because,\n\n244\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.840\nwhat happens if I have\na subnet in the fourth octet.\n\n245\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.530\nAnd I only want to permit or\ndeny that subnet,\n\n246\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.990\nthen we just do our block sizes\nthat we've already learned.\n\n247\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.020\nSo for example,\nthis is a slash 32 here, 172.16.10.32.\n\n248\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:55.440\nNow again, I can show you the math\non here, but it's really simple.\n\n249\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.780\nThe inverse mask that we're looking for\nin a particular octet,\n\n250\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.960\nif it's not a 02d5 zero means batch\nexactly, 255 means any value.\n\n251\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.870\nNow, the number that we're going to use\nis going to determine the block size.\n\n252\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:14.010\nSo I'm starting at 32, saying start\nat 32 and use a block size of 31.\n\n253\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.530\nThe inverse mask is always one less\nthan the block size you were using.\n\n254\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.120\nSo if I had a slash 28 there I put a 15\nthere because it was a block size of 15.\n\n255\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.180\nWhatever the block size is,\nmy inverse mask is one less.\n\n256\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.980\nI could show you the math but\nthis is easier just to remember.\n\n257\n00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.280\nBlock size,\nminus one is your inverse mask, all right?\n\n258\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.730\nSo in this case here, 172 16 10 32,\nlog size of 31 so this goes 32 To 63.\n\n259\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.970\nThis is a four, we start at four,\nso we're telling it where to start.\n\n260\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.810\nNow we're not putting in host addresses,\nwe're putting in the subnet numbers here.\n\n261\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.800\nThis is a four,\nwe're saying it's a block size of what?\n\n262\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.000\nGot a four there, so\na block size of four, isn't it?\n\n263\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.280\nSo this would be 4 through 7, wouldn't it?\n\n264\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.520\nStart at 128, it's a block size of 64,\nbecause I got a 63 there.\n\n265\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.640\nSo I'm going to end at, oops, I wrote 119.\n\n266\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:16.150\nI typed it in again, 191,\nbecause the next block size 64 is 192.\n\n267\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.080\nThis is a block size of 64.\n\n268\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.910\nThis is a block size of 16.\n\n269\n00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.540\nStart at 32 and go to 47.\n\n270\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.762\nThis is a block size of 8.\n\n271\n00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:27.270\nGo to 8 and go 15.\n\n272\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:33.151\nI like this one Okay,\n\n273\n00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:40.325\nso we got 15 in the third octet, so\nthis is a block size of 16, So it goes 16.\n\n274\n00:13:40.325 --> 00:13:45.445\nNext block size 32, so\nI'm going to put a 31 there, and a .0.285.\n\n275\n00:13:45.445 --> 00:13:50.600\nThat's what this gives me,\nbecause this 285 means anything, four.\n\n276\n00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.860\nNow, this might not make any sense\nto you if you not watched our\n\n277\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.707\nsubnetting episodes.\n\n278\n00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:58.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If this is really confusing to you,\n\n279\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.060\nstop, put it on pause, go back because\nI'm not explaining it all of it, am I?\n\n280\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:07.288\nBlock size of four, any value,\n4.0, 7.255, all right?\n\n281\n00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:10.520\nThat's what we're referencing\nby using the Inverse Mask.\n\n282\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.396\nWe can reference a whole octet or\ntwo octets, right.\n\n283\n00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:20.630\nIn this example, access lists are actually\npretty simple to be honest with you.\n\n284\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.490\nAccess list, easier than that shows.\n\n285\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.080\nAccess lists, what's that ten say?\n\n286\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.460\nSo I say global config,\naccess list, ten, what's that mean?\n\n287\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.680\n>> It's a number, the access list.\n\n288\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.312\n>> It means it's a standard access list.\n\n289\n00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:38.700\n>> Standard, okay.\n>> I only filter on source IP only.\n\n290\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.216\nI have no other options here.\n\n291\n00:14:40.216 --> 00:14:45.640\nAccess list standard permit.\n\n292\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.750\nNow, check this out,\npermit Or Sally, whatever.\n\n293\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.490\nSo, instead of using the 0.0.0,\nthey came up with a new command.\n\n294\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.970\nThis wasn't there for,\nI don't know, 10 years.\n\n295\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.060\nYou can use it instead of that.\n\n296\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.650\nUse the host.\n\n297\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.680\nI recommend using the host.\n\n298\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.560\nAs a matter of fact,\nif I type in the quad zeros now and\n\n299\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.720\nyou do a show run you'll see that it\nchanges it to host Bob or whatever.\n\n300\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.410\nNow, so there is no difference between\nthis line and this line and whatsoever.\n\n301\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.470\nFirst one just says, premiered bob and\nnext line says premiered sally.\n\n302\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.140\nIf you could type it either way.\n\n303\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.872\nYes it changes at the host,\nbut knock yourself out.\n\n304\n00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:22.970\nIf you type it either way\non the exam sims as well.\n\n305\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.140\nI usually use the host exam to teach\nmy students to use the host exam,\n\n306\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.802\nhost configuration for exam.\n\n307\n00:15:29.802 --> 00:15:32.500\nAll right, then I go to my interface and\none of my IP.\n\n308\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.370\nNow the command here is different.\n\n309\n00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:40.280\nFirst off, you start with the protocol,\nIP access group 10 in.\n\n310\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.500\nSo, who can come in?\n\n311\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.830\nSo what's this line say?\n\n312\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.990\nWho can come in e zero?\n\n313\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.780\nWho can come in e zero?\n\n314\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.070\nBob and Sally.\n\n315\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.335\nWho else can come in e zero?\n\n316\n00:15:50.335 --> 00:15:54.417\nNobody, nothing, zero, zippo, right?\n\n317\n00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:56.233\nBecause the next line says, deny any.\n\n318\n00:15:56.233 --> 00:16:00.451\nIt's there by default right, so\nwhoever you permit can come in.\n\n319\n00:16:00.451 --> 00:16:02.590\nNo one else can come in.\n\n320\n00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.090\nNow, I can fix that, and we'll take\na look at that in my next examples.\n\n321\n00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.410\nSo, I'm gonna go through some numbered\naccess lists and named access lists.\n\n322\n00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.200\nYou can see that they're\nnot really any different.\n\n323\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.880\nWild card example one.\n\n324\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.490\nOkay, here's my finance server.\n\n325\n00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.750\nHere's sales.\n\n326\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.070\nWe're going to deny sales from\ngetting into the finance land.\n\n327\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.860\nSo check out what I did here.\n\n328\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.440\nAccess list standard Deny 10.0 subnet.\n\n329\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:31.890\nNow, the first three octets match exactly,\nexactly the fourth octet can be any value.\n\n330\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.710\nOkay, deny sale,\nisn't that the sales vlan?\n\n331\n00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.450\nYes it is.\n\n332\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.100\nNow, so I'm denying it from doing what,\nwe'll get back to that.\n\n333\n00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.910\nBut the next thing is, but\npermit everything else.\n\n334\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.970\nThis is typically how you end your line or\n\n335\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.100\nyou're gonna end up shutting\ndown your interface.\n\n336\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.550\nI just say permit any source.\n\n337\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.070\nPermit any source.\n\n338\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.120\nBecause the next line\nby default is deny any.\n\n339\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.260\nSo, check out what this does.\n\n340\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.320\nWho can go out E1 So\n\n341\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.010\nnotice that sales, when they try\nto go out E1 and get routed out,\n\n342\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.820\nwill be blocked before they're\nrouted to that E1 interface.\n\n343\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.910\nThey'll be blocked, right?\n\n344\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.600\nSo, as soon as they come in,\nthey're sitting in the buffers in E0,\n\n345\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.660\nthey won't even be routed\nto E1 at this point.\n\n346\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.170\nHowever, if they're trying to\ngo the internet, will they work?\n\n347\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.020\nAbsolutely they'll work.\n\n348\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.810\nBecause this is.\n\n349\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.430\nBecause first off they will\nbe able to go out e zero.\n\n350\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.160\nIt's just when they come back, right?\n\n351\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.360\nWe're going to be able to see that.\n\n352\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.284\nWe're going to be able to come out.\n\n353\n00:17:25.284 --> 00:17:28.198\nWe don't even have an access\nlist on e zero do we?\n\n354\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.721\nSo only when they're sitting in e zero.\n\n355\n00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:34.680\nAnd saying, hey,\nIP I need to route out e1.\n\n356\n00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.610\nThey say you have to go\nthrough this access list.\n\n357\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.330\nBefore you can route out e1.\n\n358\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.740\nThat's gonna be dropped.\n\n359\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.960\nThis case here, sales is free to go\nanywhere they want except out e1.\n\n360\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.770\nFinance can go out the internet\nback because when they come back,\n\n361\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.550\nthey're not coming from ten dot zero,\nthey're coming from the internet.\n\n362\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.680\nFinance and Sales can't see each\nother at all with this simple line.\n\n363\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.730\nVery simple access list IP,\n\n364\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.510\nyou guys gotta remember,\nit's different command on the interface.\n\n365\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:04.630\nIP access group on the interface,\nIP access group.\n\n366\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.482\nOkay, now, this is Bob and now, we're deny\nBob access access-list 10 deny Bob and\n\n367\n00:18:09.482 --> 00:18:10.492\nthen permit any.\n\n368\n00:18:10.492 --> 00:18:12.246\nSo he can't go out e1.\n\n369\n00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:16.016\nNotice on a standard I put closest to the\ndestination, not closest to the source.\n\n370\n00:18:16.016 --> 00:18:19.183\nCuz had I put it in here,\nBob wouldn't be able to go anywhere.\n\n371\n00:18:19.183 --> 00:18:21.538\nMaybe that's what you want,\nthen you'd say anyone.\n\n372\n00:18:21.538 --> 00:18:24.402\nBut in this case here,\nwhat's another way for me to write this?\n\n373\n00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:29.770\nGot 172.16.10.2 0.0.0.0.\n\n374\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.794\nSo I could have said deny host.\n\n375\n00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:34.918\n172.16.10.2.\n\n376\n00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:36.285\nOkay?\n\n377\n00:18:36.285 --> 00:18:37.781\nAnd then you don't have the quad zero.\n\n378\n00:18:37.781 --> 00:18:38.421\nOne or the other.\n\n379\n00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:39.028\nNot both.\n\n380\n00:18:39.028 --> 00:18:41.813\nEither way in this case here.\n\n381\n00:18:41.813 --> 00:18:43.610\nBob would not be able to get to finance.\n\n382\n00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.540\nBut everyone else.\n\n383\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.090\nCan everyone else in sales get to finance?\n\n384\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.910\nAbsolutely.\n\n385\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:49.760\nPermit anyone else.\n\n386\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.316\nWill allow anyone else.\n\n387\n00:18:50.316 --> 00:18:52.363\nSo notice I denied Bob first.\n\n388\n00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.418\nBut permitted everybody else.\n\n389\n00:18:54.418 --> 00:18:56.559\nOkay, let's take a look\nat a wild card example.\n\n390\n00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:58.950\nLet's see if Ronny was paying attention,\nand he can do his block size.\n\n391\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.495\nSound good?\n\n392\n00:18:59.495 --> 00:19:00.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You guys ready?\n\n393\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:00.780\nAll right, here we go.\n\n394\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.250\nAll right, Ronnie, what do you think?\n\n395\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.510\nWe want to deny sales to the finance LAN.\n\n396\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.070\nSo what are you going to type\nin here in these two spaces.\n\n397\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.824\n>> This is access list deny 192.168.10.\n\n398\n00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.890\nHere's sales.\n\n399\n00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.050\n>> It's the 128.\n\n400\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.980\n>> You have to tell what\nthe block size it because we don't\n\n401\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.708\nwant to use the whole block\nwe've got some over here.\n\n402\n00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:36.640\n>> That's 64\n>> And then, so it would be 63.\n\n403\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.260\n>> 63 is correct.\n\n404\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.160\nSo we're saying block size is 64.\n\n405\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.500\nYou put a 63,\none less than the block size.\n\n406\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.950\nStart at 128 and go to 191.\n\n407\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:48.345\nNow, anyone from 0 to 127 Is available,\nright?\n\n408\n00:19:48.345 --> 00:19:51.035\nNot all of those are by default but\nyou get my point.\n\n409\n00:19:51.035 --> 00:19:53.495\nThis is allowing that it's\njust stopping from 128 to 191.\n\n410\n00:19:53.495 --> 00:19:55.765\nThat's all it's blocking.\n\n411\n00:19:55.765 --> 00:20:00.391\nSo instead of saying, to defy there at\nthe end and blocking the whole octet\n\n412\n00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:04.510\nwe're only blocking a block size\nthen permit any and then go out.\n\n413\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.289\nNow, let's take a look at these same\nthings with named access lists.\n\n414\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.840\nSo these are the same things.\n\n415\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.850\nI'm just doing it as a named\naccess list instead.\n\n416\n00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.730\nNow, I would need you guys to remember,\nit's case sensitive.\n\n417\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.384\nWhen I go to my lab I'll show you,\nI'll do a non-case sensitive one.\n\n418\n00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:22.511\nSo instead of starting\nwith access list ten,\n\n419\n00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:28.621\nI start with please pay attention to what\nI'm telling you, IP access-list standard.\n\n420\n00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:31.813\nOkay, it's so easy to get confused\nwhen you're on the exam and\n\n421\n00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:33.450\nyou're under duress, right?\n\n422\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.970\nAnd you type in access list ten maybe\nit doesn't take it, I don't know.\n\n423\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.580\nBut, maybe they say put a named in and\nyou type in access list and\n\n424\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.540\ntry to type a name and you can't.\n\n425\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.250\nIt starts with IP access list standard.\n\n426\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.250\nAnd notice I meant sales.\n\n427\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.260\nThe capital S is important to you.\n\n428\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.184\nAll right, it's case sensitive.\n\n429\n00:20:49.184 --> 00:20:52.395\nAll right, so I'm saying,\nnow why do we use this?\n\n430\n00:20:52.395 --> 00:20:54.975\nWell, two things, and I'll show you this.\n\n431\n00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:59.123\nWell, one, it names it so it helps us\nadministratively understand what the list\n\n432\n00:20:59.123 --> 00:21:00.836\nis for, and two, we can edit it.\n\n433\n00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:02.962\nYou can not edit a numbered list.\n\n434\n00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:05.191\nYou can only edit named list.\n\n435\n00:21:05.191 --> 00:21:08.148\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n436\n00:21:08.148 --> 00:21:10.588\nAll right, but\nnotice I type in the same lines,\n\n437\n00:21:10.588 --> 00:21:14.078\ndeny 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255, permit any.\n\n438\n00:21:14.078 --> 00:21:17.174\nNow the whole thing is,\nis they're somewhat easier,\n\n439\n00:21:17.174 --> 00:21:21.028\neven though they have a terrible\nthing here, config-std-nacl.\n\n440\n00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:25.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nacl, I hate that, config-std-nacl.\n\n441\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.931\nAnyways, so this is telling me\nyou're doing a name standard, right?\n\n442\n00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:32.263\nAnd now, I don't have to type in\naccess-list 10 for every line,\n\n443\n00:21:32.263 --> 00:21:34.495\nI just put in what I'm\nactually trying to do.\n\n444\n00:21:34.495 --> 00:21:37.680\nDeny 172.16.10.0, permit any.\n\n445\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.850\nNow, I go to the interface,\nI basically type in the same thing, IP,\n\n446\n00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.320\nit starts with IP.\n\n447\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.115\nIP, okay?\n\n448\n00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:46.720\naccess-group Sales out.\n\n449\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.760\nI've had too many people come\noff the test and fail and\n\n450\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.780\ngo I couldn't remember how\nto put it on my interface.\n\n451\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.018\nI kept trying to site access 10,\nno, it's IP access group.\n\n452\n00:21:55.018 --> 00:21:56.295\nNot only that.\n\n453\n00:21:56.295 --> 00:21:57.820\nIt's not access.\n\n454\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.470\nIt's access group.\n\n455\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.610\nSo I think I'm making it very clear.\n\n456\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.230\nIP access group.\n\n457\n00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:06.970\nAnd notice the sales is capital S It's\nthe same thing as we did before.\n\n458\n00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.610\nIs there a difference\nbetween number to name?\n\n459\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.570\nNone in this case.\n\n460\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.710\nI can just edit this, insert a line,\ntake out a line and stuff like that.\n\n461\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.360\nWhere with numbered, if I wanna change it,\nI have to delete the whole thing.\n\n462\n00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.646\nTake a look at one more example and\nthen we'll go and do a lab.\n\n463\n00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:21.880\nIP access-list standard deny_Bob.\n\n464\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.638\nNotice this is that other one, right?\n\n465\n00:22:23.638 --> 00:22:27.910\nAnd remember non-capital D capital B,\ndeny host 172.16.10.2.\n\n466\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.473\nNotice I use the host command and\nthen permit any IP\n\n467\n00:22:32.473 --> 00:22:39.240\naccess-group case sensitive deny_Bob out.\n\n468\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.630\nPretty darn simple, and I recommend\nguys get into your packet tracer or\n\n469\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.860\nwhatever you're using In\ndoing both of these, right?\n\n470\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.250\nThey're gonna have you troubleshoot, and\n\n471\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.460\nwe're gonna talk about that\nwhen we get to my lab, okay?\n\n472\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.910\nA couple things,\nI like this question here, it says,\n\n473\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.790\nyou have the following\nfour test statements.\n\n474\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.910\nCan I replace all these?\n\n475\n00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.780\nYes, because inverse NAS\nallowing me to take a group,\n\n476\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.600\nalmost like summarization I like\nthis kind of a subnet question,\n\n477\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.500\nsummary question, and\nan access-list question.\n\n478\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.000\nLet's take a look at this for a minute.\n\n479\n00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.610\nSo when we were in summaries and\nwe did that episode, remember that we used\n\n480\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.060\ncontiguous blocks of subnets, and\nwe're gonna look at the same thing here.\n\n481\n00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.082\nWhat do I see that's interesting?\n\n482\n00:23:16.082 --> 00:23:17.680\n16, 17, 18, 19.\n\n483\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.510\nSo, if I said access was 10,\nI've gonna rid of all these three lines.\n\n484\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.755\nAccess 10 start at my first one,\njust like when we did our summary.\n\n485\n00:23:24.755 --> 00:23:28.400\n0.0, what would tell me I have\na block size of four here,\n\n486\n00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.290\nwhat number would I out in here Ronnie.\n\n487\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.880\nCuz I have continuous block of four,\n16,17,18,19.\n\n488\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.250\n>> Block size of four, three.\n\n489\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.330\n>> Three, so I just type 003,\n\n490\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.650\nthat should be five and now it's gonna\ncover all these four lines with one entry.\n\n491\n00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.870\nThat is very cool.\n\n492\n00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:50.401\nSubnet, summary and access list question\nall in the same question, okay?\n\n493\n00:23:50.401 --> 00:23:54.406\nNow, remember I was saying, we don't\nreally want to put an access list on\n\n494\n00:23:54.406 --> 00:23:59.252\nan interface, the minute you access, now\nyou're router's like im gig, I'm flying,\n\n495\n00:23:59.252 --> 00:24:02.867\ncome on in, I'm routing you as fast\nas I can [LAUGH] pushing you off,\n\n496\n00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:05.084\non making you someone else's problem.\n\n497\n00:24:05.084 --> 00:24:10.051\nBut the point is, is we put an access\nthat goes whoa, slow down there partner,\n\n498\n00:24:10.051 --> 00:24:14.760\nI need to look at you in every single\nother packet now that comes in.\n\n499\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.290\nThe minute you put it in,\nbam, latency on your router.\n\n500\n00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.920\nNow our interfaces I gotta\nadmit are pretty fast today.\n\n501\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.430\nThere's not as bit a deal to have\nan access list on some router interfaces.\n\n502\n00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.420\nNow remember when we talked\nabout in our ethernet section or\n\n503\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.580\nthe OSI section,\nwe talked about our three layers.\n\n504\n00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.050\nWe didn't want any access\nlist on our core right?\n\n505\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.700\nOur core layer just wants to fly.\n\n506\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.580\nWe put those on our distribution layer.\n\n507\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.760\nJust be careful you don't really want\nto apply access lists unless you\n\n508\n00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.250\nabsolutely have to.\n\n509\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.670\nNow, let's say I have some routers.\n\n510\n00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.400\nThey're my core.\n\n511\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.200\nI want to protect them, because if\nsomeone gets their IP and they break in,\n\n512\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.912\nthey can telnet in, maybe SSH, whatever.\n\n513\n00:24:52.912 --> 00:24:54.760\nI want to secure them, so\n\n514\n00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.470\nwould I have to put an access\nlist on every single interface?\n\n515\n00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.120\nIn this instance, yes, kind of.\n\n516\n00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.730\nI have to go and say block telnet from\nany source coming into these but maybe\n\n517\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.280\nthere's a better way to do that cuz I\ndon't want to put an access list on there.\n\n518\n00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.530\nSo let's add it on to our\nVTY lines themselves so\n\n519\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.190\nif something comes in I still get security\n\n520\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.810\ncuz no one's going to be able to\nbreak in if I secure my VTY lines.\n\n521\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.170\nSo I still get security by\nputting them on the VTY lines.\n\n522\n00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.520\nNotice I'm going to use\na named access list here.\n\n523\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.680\nIt doesn't really matter,\n\n524\n00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.860\nI just did that because I really want you\nto get used to it for the objectives.\n\n525\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.250\nSo I went to global config and\n\n526\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.890\nsaid IP access list,\nnotice I used a standard, no VTY access.\n\n527\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.550\nNow I have to remember\nhow I typed that out, so\n\n528\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.621\nyou want to type out your names very\nsimply so you don't make mistakes.\n\n529\n00:25:40.621 --> 00:25:44.150\nNo_VTY_Access right?\n\n530\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:50.860\nAnd then I permitted,\nthis is my admin VPM group, right?\n\n531\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.248\nSo I'm permitting only the source address,\nso someone would have to know what does\n\n532\n00:25:55.248 --> 00:25:59.970\nsource address is, and then be able to VTY\nin and then to get past my password still.\n\n533\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.630\nIt gives us more security.\n\n534\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.890\nNow, to apply an access list\nto interface the command is\n\n535\n00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.800\nIP access group to apply it to a VTY line,\nand\n\n536\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.390\ndon't just choose 0 4 here,\nthose are just my defaults as an example.\n\n537\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:20.270\nIt's access-class,\naccess-class No_VTY_Access in, okay?\n\n538\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.780\nThis is an objective\nthey're gonna hit you on.\n\n539\n00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.050\nThey definitely wanna make\nsure that you can do this.\n\n540\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.860\nSince they're not using extended access\nlists, and this wasn't a big lab that I\n\n541\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.560\nsaw in their course where I guarantee\nthey're gonna head on this.\n\n542\n00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.160\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n543\n00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:38.780\nTo monitor an ACL,\naccess list, show access list,\n\n544\n00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.050\nshow IP access list, show IPv6\naccess list, show access list ten.\n\n545\n00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.440\nHow we wanna type it out?\n\n546\n00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.890\nThese are shown of,\nhere's my SALES, named access list.\n\n547\n00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.120\nAnd it's a standard.\n\n548\n00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.372\nNow this numbers here\nare called sequence numbers\n\n549\n00:26:56.567 --> 00:27:01.055\nNow what this allows me to do\nnow is I'll come in here and\n\n550\n00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:05.460\nI'll say config t,\nIP access list standard SALES.\n\n551\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.880\nCuz that's what this said.\n\n552\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.020\nAnd then I'll type in the number 15,\nI'll press Enter, and\n\n553\n00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.860\nthen I'll put in my whatever it is,\ndeny or permit a statement.\n\n554\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.780\nAnd then it will insert it here.\n\n555\n00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.390\nThat's how you edit it.\n\n556\n00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.400\nYou can insert it.\n\n557\n00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.720\nOr I could type in ten for example.\n\n558\n00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.710\nAnd I could say no.\n\n559\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.400\nAnd take out that line.\n\n560\n00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.550\nOr put in another line.\n\n561\n00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.940\nAs 11 or 12.\nSo by using those sequence numbers.\n\n562\n00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.500\nIt allows me to insert and take them out.\n\n563\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.040\nOr even change an existing lines.\n\n564\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.070\nPretty cool.\n\n565\n00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.860\nAll right here's an extended one.\n\n566\n00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.990\nNotice we have a lot of\nmore variables on this,\n\n567\n00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.830\nbut notice there was a named one for\nengineering there.\n\n568\n00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.470\nOkay very important for\nyour objectives guys.\n\n569\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.310\nWhen we were doing the cisco IOS\nepisode I pushed a few commands.\n\n570\n00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.030\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n571\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.750\nShow protocols.\n\n572\n00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.430\nAnd show IP interface.\n\n573\n00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.880\nAll right and\nI did say I did tell you about your, so\n\n574\n00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.280\nthis is show IP interface,\nhere's my fast switching.\n\n575\n00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.280\nI said, how can you see\na fast switching's enabled?\n\n576\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.340\nShow IP interface.\n\n577\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.500\nHow can I see if proxy ARP is enabled?\n\n578\n00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.400\nSplit horizon is enabled?\n\n579\n00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.090\nRemember we talked about RIP\nwe talked about split horizon.\n\n580\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:13.030\nAnd then this tells me right here\nif I have, whoops, well whatever,\n\n581\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.600\nI just wrote over it, but it tells me if I\nhave an access list set on that interface.\n\n582\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.890\nShow IP interface.\n\n583\n00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.010\nTo delete access list\nit's no access list 10 or\n\n584\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.070\nno, the other thing is I have\nto type out the whole thing.\n\n585\n00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:35.790\nNo IP access list standard sales, right?\n\n586\n00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.950\nAnd that deletes the whole\nlist in that case,\n\n587\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.470\nright, I don't have to type\nout every line, ever so.\n\n588\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.530\nBut if I'm doing the number to access\nlist, it's really easy, no access list\n\n589\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.670\nten, boom, no access list a hundred by\nthe thousand extent of lines, boom.\n\n590\n00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.500\nThey're all gone.\n\n591\n00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.770\nCan edit a numbered access list.\n\n592\n00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.780\nAnd then I take it off the interface,\nno IP access group 10 in,\n\n593\n00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.880\nno IP access group sales in,\nright, if it was named, okay?\n\n594\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.160\nAll right, so\n\n595\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.070\nbefore we do that let's go to our lab,\nlet's take a look at some labs here.\n\n596\n00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.585\nAnd let's create an access,\ntake a look and edit some access lists.\n\n597\n00:29:11.637 --> 00:29:13.040\nOkay.\nSo config t.\n\n598\n00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.310\nOkay.\n\n599\n00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.800\nSo I can do this, access-list.\n\n600\n00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.785\nAnd I can see all\nthe different access lists.\n\n601\n00:29:20.785 --> 00:29:23.580\n[LAUGH] So we just use the top ones.\n\n602\n00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.680\nRight?\nWe still have IPX in here.\n\n603\n00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.870\nThere's MPLS.\n\n604\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.040\nDECnet.\n\n605\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.180\nWow, Appletalk.\n\n606\n00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.510\nAnd when I saw it was ten or\nyears more ago, we did DECnet and\n\n607\n00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.240\nAppletalk and IPX and so on, but\nwe have IPv6 in here and the whole thing.\n\n608\n00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.750\nSo, anyway, so\nI don't want all these IP access-list.\n\n609\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.310\nIf I said ten,\nwhat kind of access am I doing?\n\n610\n00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.870\n>> Standard.\n\n611\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.690\n>> Standard, so deny host bob.\n\n612\n00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.180\nNow can I type in?\n\n613\n00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.520\nYes.\nThe funny thing is,\n\n614\n00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.400\nnotice what happened here.\n\n615\n00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.210\nI didn't have no ip domain\nlookup on obviously.\n\n616\n00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.730\nBut notice when I typed bob, it said okay.\n\n617\n00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.060\nI'm gonna go resolve that for you.\n\n618\n00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.010\nSo this doesn't really help you here\nbecause you're like well I'm just\n\n619\n00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.170\ngonna type bob because he's on DHCP and\nhe's a static.\n\n620\n00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.690\nAnd he's using DHCP and\nthat address can change.\n\n621\n00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.030\nNow what happens is it goes out and\nresolves it the first time.\n\n622\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.790\nIn this case, it's saying it can't.\n\n623\n00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.380\nSo if I did this and Bob was,\nI don't know, right?\n\n624\n00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.180\nNow I'm denying Bob.\n\n625\n00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.610\nThe problem with this right here\nis if Bob changes his IP address.\n\n626\n00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.640\nSo this is helpful if you have static\naddresses or Bob doesn't know how to\n\n627\n00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.520\nchange his address to an IP config\nrenew or something like that.\n\n628\n00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:36.305\nSo my next line would be\naccess-list 10 permit,\n\n629\n00:30:36.305 --> 00:30:41.288\nsales, well Bob I'll say, I don't know.\n\n630\n00:30:41.288 --> 00:30:43.638\n1.1.1.0, right?\n\n631\n00:30:43.638 --> 00:30:45.860\nAnd then 0.0.0.285.\n\n632\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.500\nRight.\nSo\n\n633\n00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.850\nnow I denied someone in 1.1.1,\ndenied sales, that whole subnet.\n\n634\n00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.490\nAnd then, you wanna do this, access list.\n\n635\n00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:56.370\nSo we permitted sales.\n\n636\n00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.791\nSo that would kind of be good enough.\n\n637\n00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:01.420\nIf I set it up, I went to f0/0,\n\n638\n00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:07.060\nI would say ip access,\naccess ip access Group.\n\n639\n00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.620\nOkay, for an interface,\nIP access group, and we did 10,\n\n640\n00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.010\nand we'd say out or in or\nwhichever one we wanted, so\n\n641\n00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.730\nthat's a simple standard access list,\na numbered access list.\n\n642\n00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.340\nNow to get it off my interface, I'm\ngoing to have to do the whole thing, so\n\n643\n00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.090\nI'm going to bring it up to a CTRL+A,\nsay no in front of it, and\n\n644\n00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.325\nthen no access list 10.\n\n645\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.650\nThat list is gone.\n\n646\n00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:35.200\nAll right, so now lets do another one,\nand lets do this,\n\n647\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:42.841\nI'm going to say IP\naccesslist standard,Sales.\n\n648\n00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.850\nExcept I gotta spell it right.\n\n649\n00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.560\nOkay, so now, config,\nstandard, nacl, right?\n\n650\n00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.521\nSo now we're doing it.\n\n651\n00:31:52.521 --> 00:31:56.953\nNow I can deny 1.1.1.1, and\n\n652\n00:31:56.953 --> 00:32:03.349\npermit 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.285.\n\n653\n00:32:03.349 --> 00:32:09.810\nYou know what's funny is,\nI didn't type in the quad 0 or host.\n\n654\n00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.180\nLet's see what it did.\n\n655\n00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.200\nIt took it.\n\n656\n00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.091\nIt didn't use to take that, gosh, for\nten years people would type that in, and\n\n657\n00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:18.854\nyou gotta think about this.\n\n658\n00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:23.294\nIn the early and mid 90s, even late 90s,\nand they would type this and say well,\n\n659\n00:32:23.294 --> 00:32:25.650\nI want to deny 1.1.1.1, whatever.\n\n660\n00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.330\nAnd it would give you an error cuz\nyou didn't do the inverse mask.\n\n661\n00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.470\nAnd someone would call and Cisco would\nthen have to explain inverse mask to them.\n\n662\n00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.468\nDo you know how hard it\nwould have been back then?\n\n663\n00:32:32.468 --> 00:32:33.948\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n664\n00:32:33.948 --> 00:32:37.007\nToday's it's relatively simple, more\npeople understand IP and stuff like that.\n\n665\n00:32:37.007 --> 00:32:40.336\nBut if you didn't understand IP,\nthat would have been [SOUND], right?\n\n666\n00:32:40.336 --> 00:32:43.261\nSo what they did, it says we know what\nyou mean, we're gonna make that work,\n\n667\n00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.480\nplease stop calling us.\n\n668\n00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.350\nAll right, and then ip access-group,\nbut let's do this, do sh run.\n\n669\n00:32:49.608 --> 00:32:55.990\nActually I do want to do it,\nint f0/0, ip access-group.\n\n670\n00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.000\nWhat am I gonna type in?\n\n671\n00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.048\nSales out, right, so now I'm not\nusing the number, I'm using that.\n\n672\n00:33:02.048 --> 00:33:04.670\nNow I'm gonna keep taking these off so\nI don't screw up my network.\n\n673\n00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.620\nBut before I do this,\nI wanna do something, do sh run.\n\n674\n00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.820\nLet's see how it parsed this.\n\n675\n00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.941\nWhat happened was the deny 1.1.1.1.\n\n676\n00:33:14.129 --> 00:33:16.329\nCome on.\n\n677\n00:33:16.329 --> 00:33:17.040\nHey, come on.\n\n678\n00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.230\nOkay, so it did leave it in there,\nit didn't change it to host.\n\n679\n00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.401\nBut most of the time it has but it's just,\n\n680\n00:33:28.401 --> 00:33:30.896\nyou just have to assume that's quad 0 or\nhost.\n\n681\n00:33:30.896 --> 00:33:32.871\nMost of the time I've seen\nthat being changed to host.\n\n682\n00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:35.614\nBut in this new 15.2 code, which I\nhaven't played around with all that much,\n\n683\n00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:38.372\nthose are some of the quirks they\nprobably didn't change out of there.\n\n684\n00:33:38.372 --> 00:33:40.920\nBut anyways, we can see our\nstandard access list there and\n\n685\n00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.613\nI can easily get it out of here.\n\n686\n00:33:42.613 --> 00:33:48.547\nno ip access-list standard,\n\n687\n00:33:51.217 --> 00:33:54.226\nNow remember-\n>> Access is misspelled there.\n\n688\n00:33:54.226 --> 00:33:57.900\n>> Yeah,\nremember that it's case sensitive.\n\n689\n00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.991\nSo let's go up and now that we've\nkinda just played with those,\n\n690\n00:34:00.991 --> 00:34:04.826\nwhat I wanna do is, let's go up to San\nFrancisco router here and do something for\n\n691\n00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:06.616\nreal and see something get blocked.\n\n692\n00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:10.850\nAlso verify that our\nnames are case sensitive.\n\n693\n00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.710\nSo I'm gonna do config t.\n\n694\n00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.280\nI want security on here, but I don't want\nto put an access on an interface, right.\n\n695\n00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.370\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n696\n00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.710\njust, we don't have any reason to block\ntraffic going in and out our interfaces.\n\n697\n00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.110\nI just don't want anyone being able\nto get into my lines, my VTY lines.\n\n698\n00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.570\nSo I'm just gonna create\na simple standard access list.\n\n699\n00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:36.055\nip access-list standard,\ndid I spell that right?\n\n700\n00:34:36.055 --> 00:34:37.320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n701\n00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.480\n>> Ugh.\n>> Missing a c.\n\n702\n00:34:40.686 --> 00:34:47.800\n>> Block_VTY, okay?\n\n703\n00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.850\nSo we're just saying Block_VTY.\n\n704\n00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.940\nNow [COUGH]\n>> It's access-list.\n\n705\n00:34:53.940 --> 00:35:02.122\n>> [COUGH] Okay,\nip access-list standard Block_VTY.\n\n706\n00:35:02.122 --> 00:35:06.658\nNow I'm gonna permit 172.16.10.6\n\n707\n00:35:06.658 --> 00:35:11.312\nwhich is the LA router\nthat would come into here.\n\n708\n00:35:11.312 --> 00:35:13.123\nOkay, so that's all I'm gonna do.\n\n709\n00:35:13.123 --> 00:35:14.012\nAnd I could do hosts,\n\n710\n00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:16.690\nI could just press Enter here,\nas we found out in the last thing.\n\n711\n00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.443\nBut I'm gonna just say permit host.\n\n712\n00:35:18.443 --> 00:35:21.642\nDoesn't even matter,\nI could have just said, 172.16.10 Enter.\n\n713\n00:35:21.642 --> 00:35:25.130\nThat's all I'm gonna do, all right?\n\n714\n00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.600\nThat's my list.\n\n715\n00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:32.208\nAnd then line, vty 0 space,\nI think it's 988.\n\n716\n00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:35.885\nWhat's the command to put it on\nthe VTY lines, anybody remember?\n\n717\n00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:38.825\n>> IP access-class, or is it just access?\n\n718\n00:35:38.825 --> 00:35:42.015\n>> Yes, access-class.\n\n719\n00:35:42.015 --> 00:35:42.975\n>> No ip necessary.\n\n720\n00:35:42.975 --> 00:35:49.009\n>> And then I'm gonna do, check this out,\nblock_VTY, I spelled it wrong on purpose.\n\n721\n00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.430\nOkay, access block_VTY in.\n\n722\n00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:00.158\nSo I just added a access list\nto my VTY lines, all right.\n\n723\n00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.727\nNow we're gonna try that and I think\nyou're all aware that this shouldn't work.\n\n724\n00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:05.700\nI'm just gonna show you how important\nit is to do case sensitive.\n\n725\n00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:11.209\nAll right, so let's do this so\nbefore I do it, sh access- list, okay?\n\n726\n00:36:11.209 --> 00:36:19.110\nIt's just, I'm permitting a host\n172.16.10.6, so Block_VTY.\n\n727\n00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.150\nSo basically that's all we have on here.\n\n728\n00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.970\nSo check this out, So\nI should be blocking everyone else.\n\n729\n00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.060\nSo the Corp router shouldn't\nbe able to get in here because\n\n730\n00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.260\nI'm only allowing 10.6,\nwhich is the LA router.\n\n731\n00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:38.690\nSo I'm gonna say 172.16.10.2, and\nI'm in because it's not case sensitive.\n\n732\n00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.801\nI mean cuz it is case sensitive and\nI didn't type it as case sensitive.\n\n733\n00:36:41.801 --> 00:36:46.790\nI'm going to go over here,\n172.16.10.2, and I'm in, all right?\n\n734\n00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:53.020\nNote I did a no login for this lab so, I\nhate passwords when I'm doing labs, right?\n\n735\n00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:58.489\nAll right so let me come back over\nhere now and let's do config t line,\n\n736\n00:37:01.143 --> 00:37:04.757\nvty [LAUGH] Todd, line vty,\n\n737\n00:37:04.757 --> 00:37:09.505\nwhat is it, 0- 988 isn't it?\n\n738\n00:37:09.505 --> 00:37:10.140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n739\n00:37:12.532 --> 00:37:15.271\n>> No dash.\n\n740\n00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:20.570\nAnd then, acc, whoops, access-class, nice.\n\n741\n00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.370\nWhat was it?\n\n742\n00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:29.600\nBlock, now we understand how important\nthat is that it's case sensitive.\n\n743\n00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.701\nSo let's go back over here to Corp,\nUp arrow.\n\n744\n00:37:34.628 --> 00:37:37.480\nBlocked, bam, nice.\n\n745\n00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.114\nNow come back over here.\n\n746\n00:37:42.313 --> 00:37:44.040\nType in the IP address.\n\n747\n00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.750\nAnd I'm in because this is the one\nthat I permitted to come in.\n\n748\n00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:50.117\nSo the one we wanted in was in and\nthe one that we blocked, blocked, okay?\n\n749\n00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.165\nNow so if I come over here,\nlet's come back over here.\n\n750\n00:37:57.881 --> 00:38:02.850\nOkay, almost done guys, sh access-l.\n\n751\n00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:06.960\nOkay sh access-l, there we go.\n\n752\n00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.234\nAnd what I wanted to show you here,\ncome on, Todd.\n\n753\n00:38:10.234 --> 00:38:12.111\nsh, you, here.\n\n754\n00:38:12.111 --> 00:38:13.840\nThis is driving me crazy.\n\n755\n00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.350\nIs that I see my line here.\n\n756\n00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.760\nIt worked because I watched\nmy case sensitivity.\n\n757\n00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.031\nAnd it shows me I had 2 matches here,\nright, that I was permitted here.\n\n758\n00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:25.400\nAnd that the rest were blocked.\n\n759\n00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.985\nSo, sh access-l, right,\npermitted these guys.\n\n760\n00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:32.990\nRight, so very cool thing,\nsh log would also give me this as well.\n\n761\n00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.450\nAll right, very simple configuration.\n\n762\n00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:41.120\nMake sure you guys test these,\ntry these on your packet tracer labs.\n\n763\n00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.430\nDo a lab on this.\n\n764\n00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.520\nMake sure you set up your VTYs and\nyou block them.\n\n765\n00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.930\nYou're gonna see troubleshooting labs,\nwhy can't you telnet in here?\n\n766\n00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.730\nWhy can this guy telnet in and\nthis guy can't?\n\n767\n00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:54.970\nYou have to be able to check if\nan IP access is set on an interface.\n\n768\n00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.440\nShow IP interface, show access list,\nsee that it's logged, right?\n\n769\n00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.281\nSo we're going to troubleshoot our,\n\n770\n00:39:01.281 --> 00:39:04.279\nbasically you can see that\naccess-lists aren't that hard.\n\n771\n00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:07.052\nSo we're gonna hit on well,\nwhy isn't this working because we have to,\n\n772\n00:39:07.052 --> 00:39:09.380\nyou're gonna have an access-list\non an interface, okay?\n\n773\n00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.840\n>> All right, so in this episode remember\nwhat we actually saw here, right,\n\n774\n00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.070\nand the beginnings of security.\n\n775\n00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.690\nMake sure you go and check out those\nchapters in Todd's book as well,\n\n776\n00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.750\nas he goes into a little bit more detail\non the idea of why we actually need\n\n777\n00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:24.900\nthings like access-list.\n\n778\n00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.710\nOf course, also the other security.\n\n779\n00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:32.620\nAlso focus in, of course, on ICND1 on the\nstandard access control lists themselves.\n\n780\n00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.816\nWe know that there's standard,\n\n781\n00:39:33.816 --> 00:39:35.789\nwe know that there's extended\naccess control lists.\n\n782\n00:39:35.789 --> 00:39:39.900\nAnd they can either be numbered or,\nof course, also named here.\n\n783\n00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.350\nNow remember that once you actually learn\nthe configuration on how to do that,\n\n784\n00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.770\nthere's a second part, of course,\n\n785\n00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:47.700\nto access control lists,\nwhich is the application of them.\n\n786\n00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.800\nWhen you choose to apply them to\na router's interface, remember that\n\n787\n00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.980\nyou actually need that access-group\ncommand to do so on a physical interface.\n\n788\n00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.880\nBut if you're gonna do this to\nsomething like the VTY lines,\n\n789\n00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.340\nit changes to access-class.\n\n790\n00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:09.880\nAnd if you're doing a named access list,\nthat's gonna be ip access-group as well.\n\n791\n00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.870\nAnd so these configurations are really\nextremely helpful to provide some good,\n\n792\n00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:20.020\nsolid, basic security for our routers as\nwell, and of course even our switches.\n\n793\n00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.600\nSo do not over look them,\neven though they sound simple.\n\n794\n00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.120\nMake sure you practice them,\n\n795\n00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.270\nmake sure you understand where you're\ngonna apply these things as well.\n\n796\n00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.560\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n797\n00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.639\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n798\n00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:34.553\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n799\n00:40:34.553 --> 00:40:37.719\n>> Stay tuned for more CCENT content.\n\n800\n00:40:37.719 -->

00:00:20.220\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're gonna go into our ICND1 content.\n\n4\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.900\nGetting ready for that new exam\nthat just come out from Cisco?\n\n5\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.550\nAnd, who better to help us than Mr.\nTodd Lammle, welcome back to our studios.\n\n6\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.150\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.420\nThank you so much.\n\n8\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.190\nWe're gonna have some\ngreat episodes today, and\n\n9\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.480\nI hope you guys stick around tomorrow,\ntoo.\n\n10\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.036\nWe've got some other great episodes, but\n\n11\n00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.810\nright now we're gonna\nhit a CCENT objective.\n\n12\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.550\nWhat is this?\n\n13\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.994\nIt was in the last objectives,\n\n14\n00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:46.060\nbut I think they're going to\npush them a little bit more.\n\n15\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.770\nSo let's dive into these and\nconfigure NAT.\n\n16\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.800\nWe're going to do static,\ndynamic, and NAT overload.\n\n17\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.320\nLet's take a look.\n\n18\n00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.200\nSo we have Network Address Translation.\n\n19\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.470\nOkay, so why use NAT?\n\n20\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.680\nWell, let's talk about this.\n\n21\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.550\nI need to connect to the Internet and\n\n22\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.960\nmy hosts don't have globally\nunique IP addresses.\n\n23\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.630\nThat's the typical case and that's going\nto be the business case on the the CCA.\n\n24\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.740\nVery well made, maybe you get a sim and\nit asks you to configure NAT.\n\n25\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.220\nAnd that's really not that\nhard to configure, but\n\n26\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.100\nthe terminology can get\na little confusing at first.\n\n27\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.360\nBut, there's very little configuration.\n\n28\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.120\nAnd, I'm gonna give you the hotspots for\ntroubleshooting, as well,\n\n29\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.190\ncuz troubleshooting that,\nremember, no matter what you do,\n\n30\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.090\nwhether it's RIP,\nRIP wasn't hard to configure.\n\n31\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.890\nSo, what are they gonna do?\n\n32\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.720\nThey're gonna hit on\nthe troubleshooting in RIP,\n\n33\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.630\nnot necessarily configuration cuz\nthere's nothing really hard about that.\n\n34\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.889\nThe other thing is, if I want to change or\nre-number, that makes it pretty easy,\n\n35\n00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.997\nwhich is pretty funny cuz,\nthis doesn't work with IPv6.\n\n36\n00:01:42.997 --> 00:01:46.870\nSo, Cisco's, we love NAT,\nit helps us get on the Internet.\n\n37\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.520\nWhen we get to IPv6, we hate NAT, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.270\nSo, it's pretty funny, but anyways,\nlet's go ahead and talk about some terms.\n\n39\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.260\nFirst off our NAT Overview,\nthere are three different types of NAT.\n\n40\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.550\nThere's Static, Dynamic and\nthere's NAT Overload.\n\n41\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.040\nSo Static is a one to one, so that means\nthat I have to, for everyone that wants to\n\n42\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.680\nget on the Internet, I'm gonna have\nto get them a real global IP address.\n\n43\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.415\nIf I have 200 users,\n\n44\n00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:15.630\nI'd need a class C address, from yeah good\nluck getting that from your ISP, right?\n\n45\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.420\nSo there's dynamic, really that's\none to one as well, but what we\n\n46\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.300\ndo instead of assigning Bob a particular\naddress, we just create a pool and\n\n47\n00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.160\nBob grabs an address going out and\nthen you can put it back in.\n\n48\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.850\nThis worked well in the mid\nto late 90s because,\n\n49\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.370\nwhat did we used to do on\nthe Internet in the mid to late 90s?\n\n50\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.936\nWe used to actually, work.\n\n51\n00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:37.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Work.\n\n52\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.440\nThat's what it was.\n\n53\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.340\nI was trying to think,\nwhat is it that used to,\n\n54\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.682\nthat's why no one was on the Internet,\nthere wasn't anything fun out there, guys.\n\n55\n00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:46.690\nAll right, of course, then porn came out,\nthat changed everything, right.\n\n56\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.930\nSo, anyways, as usual.\n\n57\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.558\nBut anyway, so, we used to have 200 users\nand then we'd have a block size of 64, 62,\n\n58\n00:02:53.558 --> 00:02:58.414\nwhich was fine because we only went out\nto bulletin boards and drivers and so on.\n\n59\n00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:01.438\nBut then by the time 1998, 99 came around,\n\n60\n00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:05.974\nthat just wasn't gonna fly because there\nwas just too much fun out there for\n\n61\n00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:10.309\npeople and we needed to get on to it and\nso we used that overload, right.\n\n62\n00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.459\nAll right, to configure Static NAT,\nlet's take a look at this and\n\n63\n00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.540\nwe're gonna actually do this\nin a lab here in a second.\n\n64\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.720\nAnd notice I'm getting\nright into the configs but\n\n65\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.720\nI wanna talk about some terms first\nwhich I didn't talk about yet.\n\n66\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.570\nBut let's talk about these\nterms called inside local, and\n\n67\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.730\nthese are on your objectives.\n\n68\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.180\nThat's why I'm writing them out.\n\n69\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.390\nInside local and\nthen something called inside global.\n\n70\n00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.390\nSo the inside local, if you can see that,\nthat's kind of your host address and\n\n71\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.360\nthis is actually 10.1.1.2 in my lab.\n\n72\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.830\nSo I have this lab\nexactly set up like this.\n\n73\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.870\nI'm using a different interface,\nbut it doesn't matter.\n\n74\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.560\nI have these IP addresses in there.\n\n75\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.160\nThis is my inside local.\n\n76\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.200\nNow, I'm gonna setup an inside global,\nwhich the inside global is my translated\n\n77\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.920\naddress that I'm gonna use to\nget out onto the Internet, okay?\n\n78\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.310\nSo I'm gonna just give them a random\naddress in this point, I'm going to\n\n79\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.590\nconfigure this, so notice I went to gig01\nand configured the outside interface.\n\n80\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.514\nNow this is called right here.\n\n81\n00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:16.385\nMy interface considered the outside local.\n\n82\n00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:20.965\nAnd then my destination is outside global,\nbut I don't really care about that.\n\n83\n00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:24.645\nInside local is my host\nbefore translation.\n\n84\n00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:27.715\nInside global is the translated\naddress I'm gonna use to get out.\n\n85\n00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:31.400\nSo I'm gonna be referenced as two\naddresses, one to get out and\n\n86\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.840\none is my private RFC 1918.\n\n87\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.460\nNow it's very typical that we'd\nhave those terms and that usage.\n\n88\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.030\nNot very typical to use Static NAT\nexcept in my DMZ I absolutely use\n\n89\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.820\na combination of Static NAT and\nNAT Overload.\n\n90\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.700\nI don't see Dynamic NAT\nused too much today.\n\n91\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.720\nAnyway, so inside local, so, I'm going\nto be able to translate and get out.\n\n92\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.030\nVery simple configuration guys,\ntake a look here.\n\n93\n00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.490\nIt's really a couple of lines here.\n\n94\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.580\nYour very first troubleshooting spot\nis right here, your interfaces.\n\n95\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.880\nSo, here am at Giga face 0/1 that's\nmy outside, 0/0 is my inside.\n\n96\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.247\nYour interface markings telling you for\n\n97\n00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:14.107\nthe CCENT objectives are your\nnumber one troubleshooting spot.\n\n98\n00:05:14.107 --> 00:05:15.200\nEither they're not marked or\n\n99\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.660\nthey're marked incorrectly, cuz if I had\nfour inside interfaces, I'd have to put IP\n\n100\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.070\nnet inside of all four of those if there\nwas hosts on there that was gonna get out.\n\n101\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.740\nWhich all of them do.\n\n102\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.960\nIs there a host that just don't\ngo to the Internet today?\n\n103\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.910\nI know, you really had to scratch\nyour head and think about that one.\n\n104\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.490\nSo it's pretty simple here.\n\n105\n00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.390\nThe problem with this line\nis not that it's not hard.\n\n106\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.310\nThe problem with this is,\nif I had 25 users,\n\n107\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.950\nI'd have to type this line in 25 times\ncuz I'm doing a one to one translation.\n\n108\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.420\nAnd I also have to have an IP address, a\nglobal address, for each user to get out.\n\n109\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.905\nIP net, inside source, so\nfrom the inside, my source.\n\n110\n00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:52.940\nNow I'm gonna come back to what\nthis means here in a second.\n\n111\n00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.960\nIt's a static, here's my inside local, and\n\n112\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.050\nI'm writing out,\ndeciding on my inside global.\n\n113\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.700\nI'm actually telling it\nwhat it is to get out.\n\n114\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.580\nPretty simple, and\nnow this host will get out.\n\n115\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.390\nNow again, the problem with this is I have\nto have an address for every single one.\n\n116\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.690\nAnd it's just not scalable for today's\nnetworks, so it's kinda ridiculous.\n\n117\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.470\nBut I'm showing you this, obviously\nit's an objective, but also for my DMZ,\n\n118\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.320\nif I have an HTTP server or\nsomething I'm gonna NAT those.\n\n119\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.420\nBut I'm gonna use Static NAT-ing because\nI have to have a actual global address\n\n120\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.370\nto tell the ISP or\nwhatever what my DNS server is,\n\n121\n00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.130\nHTTP server, and stuff like that.\n\n122\n00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.240\nSo now,\ncouple of things about Static NATs.\n\n123\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.700\nThey're permanently in the NAT table,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.980\nThey're always in the NAT table,\nall right?\n\n125\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.090\nThe other thing is, now this is kind of\nridiculous, but if you think, before we\n\n126\n00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.010\nhad VPNs, people used to come from our\noutside network to our inside network.\n\n127\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.430\nAnd we used to give them ways\nthrough either access lists and\n\n128\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.440\nin this case then we can\ndo it through NAT, right?\n\n129\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.040\nAnd so\nyou could use IP NAT outside source.\n\n130\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.795\nPlease don't ever do that, all right?\n\n131\n00:07:06.795 --> 00:07:09.512\nThat's what VPNs were created for,\n\n132\n00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:13.510\nto allow someone from the outside\nin in a secure manner using IP SAT.\n\n133\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.003\nWe can NAT let an IP address in with\nthe outside source, just cuz you can,\n\n134\n00:07:18.003 --> 00:07:20.902\nwhat's that saying, just cuz you can.\n\n135\n00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:24.805\nAll right to verify this once I get this\nconfigured which is going to be next.\n\n136\n00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:29.950\nShow ip nat translations,\nshow ip nat statistics, so I can see here\n\n137\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.180\nthat here's my inside local and here's\n\n138\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.370\nmy inside global right and so I really\ndon't have much information about it.\n\n139\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.100\nBecause it's a static one-to-one\ntranslation, it's always in the table.\n\n140\n00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.840\nNotice I have something else in here.\n\n141\n00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.420\nThey're communicating.\n\n142\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.804\nSo if I was telnetting,\n\n143\n00:07:47.804 --> 00:07:52.731\nit's gonna have the port numbers in there,\nnot that we're using them in this case.\n\n144\n00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:57.775\nAnd the reason I'm bringing that up,\ncuz we will when we get to NAT Overload.\n\n145\n00:07:57.775 --> 00:08:00.299\nSo let's go ahead and\nrun out and configure this.\n\n146\n00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:01.761\nCome on CC.\n\n147\n00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:06.660\nWe need to mark our interfaces and then\ncreate a static NAT for just one host.\n\n148\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.290\nI only have the one host.\n\n149\n00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.390\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at what I got here.\n\n150\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.470\nSame thing.\n\n151\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.792\nSo there's my drawing and\nhere's my three hosts.\n\n152\n00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.852\nSo I'm gonna come down here and\nfirst off, I'm gonna do undebug all and\n\n153\n00:08:15.852 --> 00:08:16.774\nget rid of that DHDP.\n\n154\n00:08:16.774 --> 00:08:21.346\nAnd I'm just gonna come over here\nto this router and configure it.\n\n155\n00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:23.168\nAnd so I have to mark each interface.\n\n156\n00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:24.370\nSo I know my inside and outside.\n\n157\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.727\nNow I'm using my serials in here and\nthat's fine.\n\n158\n00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:33.230\nSo now,\nyou don't have to do it in this order.\n\n159\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.130\nBut if I'm on the objectives and they ask,\nwhat's the first step when creating that?\n\n160\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.450\nI'd say mark my interfaces.\n\n161\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.118\nThat's not necessarily true but\nthat's what Cisco likes, okay.\n\n162\n00:08:42.118 --> 00:08:44.812\nIP nat, I have to choose my interface.\n\n163\n00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:49.608\nInterface s0/0/0,\n\n164\n00:08:49.608 --> 00:08:52.880\nIP nat, inside.\n\n165\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.599\nOkay?\n\n166\n00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:00.307\nWas my interface not up?\n\n167\n00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:03.255\n[LAUGH] And it brings your network down.\n\n168\n00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:05.925\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There it goes.\n\n169\n00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:07.864\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It took you a moment.\n\n170\n00:09:07.864 --> 00:09:08.983\n>> What was up with that?\n\n171\n00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:12.057\n[LAUGH] The interface, s0/1/0, my gosh.\n\n172\n00:09:12.057 --> 00:09:14.255\n[LAUGH] IP nat outside.\n\n173\n00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:17.575\nAll right, so\nI marked them like Cisco told me to.\n\n174\n00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:19.670\nAll right, I did my inside and outside.\n\n175\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.140\nI don't know what was up with that, but\nmy interface must have been down for\n\n176\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.190\nwhatever reason.\n\n177\n00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.620\nAll right, so I marked my interface.\n\n178\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.510\nNow I just need one line, because I\nonly have the one host, so I say,\n\n179\n00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.537\nip nat inside source.\n\n180\n00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:35.204\nAnd it's 10.1, wait.\n\n181\n00:09:35.204 --> 00:09:35.986\nLet me go look at my figure.\n\n182\n00:09:35.986 --> 00:09:38.226\n10.1.1.2.\n\n183\n00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:42.870\nAnd I'm gonna use 209.165,\nII'll just make up some random number.\n\n184\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.043\n>> 201.5.\n\n185\n00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:45.842\n>> 201.5.\n\n186\n00:09:45.842 --> 00:09:49.173\nOkay, that was what we use in our example,\nright?\n\n187\n00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:51.170\nInside, what did I miss?\n\n188\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.271\nI forgot, inside source static.\n\n189\n00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.690\nI forgot the command, static.\n\n190\n00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.140\nInside source, it's static,\nit should know that it's static now.\n\n191\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.850\nThat's it, guys.\n\n192\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.345\nAnd I just do that same line, up arrow,\nand change the IP addresses for\n\n193\n00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:05.940\nas many hosts as I have.\n\n194\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.770\nAnd again, the only way you'd\nuse this today is pretty rarely.\n\n195\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.555\nBut there are some things\nthat NAT doesn't work for.\n\n196\n00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:16.560\nIt's, we have to keep that in mind.\n\n197\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.512\nAll applications don't support NAT.\n\n198\n00:10:18.512 --> 00:10:24.909\nSo, here's my PC, so I'm gonna telnet\nfrom 10.1.1.2 to the internet.\n\n199\n00:10:24.909 --> 00:10:26.548\nThink we can get to\nthe internet from here?\n\n200\n00:10:26.548 --> 00:10:28.081\nLet's try.\n\n201\n00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:36.162\n209.165.201.2 209.165.201.2.\n\n202\n00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:37.450\nAnd I'm on the internet.\n\n203\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.751\nWith no password.\n\n204\n00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:40.015\nThat's the way things should be.\n\n205\n00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:41.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It makes it easy.\n\n206\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.570\nAs long as it's easy for me.\n\n207\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.580\nSo I am now on the the internet.\n\n208\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.230\n[LAUGH] My pseudo-internet, right?\n\n209\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.280\nI just named it that.\n\n210\n00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.830\nAll right, so I'm gonna do what?\n\n211\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.027\nShow ip nat trans.\n\n212\n00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:59.810\nAnd there I see it, so\nhere's my telnet session.\n\n213\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.546\nLet me come back over here for\na second and ping this.\n\n214\n00:11:02.546 --> 00:11:07.646\nI'm gonna exit out of here and then ping,\n\n215\n00:11:07.646 --> 00:11:11.741\n209.165.201.2.\n\n216\n00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:12.856\nOkay, I pinged it.\n\n217\n00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:16.630\nNow let's see,\nI'm gonna see two protocols in here.\n\n218\n00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.830\nThere's TCP for my telnet session,\nand then there's ICMP there.\n\n219\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.515\nNotice it kind of randomly\nmakes up some number here.\n\n220\n00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:28.507\nThis is obviously not, because\nthe others ones, to do it, it randomly,\n\n221\n00:11:28.507 --> 00:11:33.500\nnotice it created a 49,000 number,\nabove my well known port number\n\n222\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.273\nstyles 1024 up to 65,000 to be\nable to communicate from me.\n\n223\n00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:41.803\nBut notice I don't, it's just,\nmy inside local and\n\n224\n00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:45.230\nmy inside global here,\nusing the same number.\n\n225\n00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.695\nMy outside local, that is where I'm going,\nnotice I have two and\n\n226\n00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:52.226\n23 as my destination,\nyou guys can't see that over there.\n\n227\n00:11:52.226 --> 00:11:54.768\nMy destination port is over there, right?\n\n228\n00:11:54.768 --> 00:12:00.461\nSo there it is right there, and\nthen let's see if I can see.\n\n229\n00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.342\nAnd then my outside\nglobal is my destination.\n\n230\n00:12:02.342 --> 00:12:06.122\nNotice the outside local and\noutside global are the same in this case,\n\n231\n00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.606\nwhich is the destination.\n\n232\n00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:09.382\nThat's where those terms\nget a little confusing.\n\n233\n00:12:09.382 --> 00:12:12.095\nAnd so Cisco in the objectives this time,\n\n234\n00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:16.600\nwhich is nice, they only define\nthe inside local and inside global.\n\n235\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.540\nMeaning, your host before translation and\nafter translation.\n\n236\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.342\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:23.247\n>> That was awesome.\n\n238\n00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.740\nAll right, that was easy, guys.\n\n239\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.200\nShow IP NAT translations,\nand I can see them.\n\n240\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.790\nThis is always gonna be in there,\nthis one down here.\n\n241\n00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.250\nAnd then we can see that we're using this\ntranslation with a couple port numbers.\n\n242\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.760\nThey're not referencing these IP\naddresses, these port numbers,\n\n243\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.980\nwe're just taking a look at that.\n\n244\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.560\nSo, I am gonna go ahead and delete this.\n\n245\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.110\nCheck this out,\nI am gonna leave my interface markings on.\n\n246\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.221\nWhy not, right?\n\n247\n00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.961\nI can use some different types of NAT,\nbut let me come up here and see,\n\n248\n00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:47.391\nthere's my inside source static.\n\n249\n00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:50.040\nThere's my command and\nI am gonna go ahead and get rid of that.\n\n250\n00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.850\nI did a Ctrl+A to bring my cursor\nto the beginning of the line.\n\n251\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.600\nTyped in no, and\nnow I'm not doing that anymore.\n\n252\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.780\nBut since I have my interface\nmarkings on there, guess what?\n\n253\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.180\nMy network's down, right?\n\n254\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.030\nI have my interface markings and\nnothing to translate it with,\n\n255\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.560\nso it's not gonna work.\n\n256\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.600\nSo we'd better get going over here, right?\n\n257\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.870\nNetwork's down,\nusers are gonna be calling.\n\n258\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.650\nAll right, so\nthat's static NAT, very simple.\n\n259\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.750\nNow dynamic NAT means,\nI'm gonna create a pool, right?\n\n260\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.940\nNow, it's still a one to one translation.\n\n261\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.390\nIt's just that now, we can take something\nfrom the pool, go out to the internet, and\n\n262\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.420\nthen, we can come back and\nput it in the pool when we're done.\n\n263\n00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.901\nSo we create an access list, which we\nlearn from the access list section.\n\n264\n00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:30.758\nThat's gonna permit my inside\nnetwork to use the pool.\n\n265\n00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:32.410\nThat's one of the things I have to do.\n\n266\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.260\nSo I say, access list one\nmay need a standard permit.\n\n267\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.320\nThis network, which is we can\nsee that as my inside network.\n\n268\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.330\nRright, ip nat inside.\n\n269\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.880\nNow, so I need two things.\n\n270\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.090\nNow, I need this down here\nto say who can use the pool.\n\n271\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.440\nI'm trying to make sure\nyou guys can see that.\n\n272\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.540\nIP nat,\ninside source list 1 can use pool lammle.\n\n273\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.850\nNow let's go ahead and take a look\nat pool, now this is case sensitive.\n\n274\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.545\nIf you don't march this and\nI do the capital on one and\n\n275\n00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:04.635\nthat one on this inside source command.\n\n276\n00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:08.716\nThen it's going to go ahead and say,\npools not, pool doesn't exist or\n\n277\n00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:11.453\nsomething like that,\nI'm gonna get an error.\n\n278\n00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:15.950\nIP nat pool lammle, case sensitive,\nand then notice my pool range.\n\n279\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.780\n201.3 through 201.14.\n\n280\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.347\nI'm using .1 and .2 for my router and\nthe internet, and then so\n\n281\n00:14:22.347 --> 00:14:24.550\nI can use NAT mask and type it out.\n\n282\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.535\nNow what's kinda nice, they say,\nwell, you can just use the 20,\n\n283\n00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:28.683\ntelling me how many bits.\n\n284\n00:14:28.683 --> 00:14:31.725\nBut you can't use this,\nyou can't just type in /24.\n\n285\n00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:33.129\nThat would save me some typing.\n\n286\n00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:36.020\nYou actually have to type out\nthis command prefix length.\n\n287\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.210\nSo why would I go through all that\ntrouble typing without prefix length,\n\n288\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.730\nit's not saving me any typing.\n\n289\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.670\nSo I'm gonna say NAT mask,\nand then the mask here.\n\n290\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.170\nSo, ip nat pool lammle.\n\n291\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.780\nThat's gonna match ip nat inside source.\n\n292\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.821\nList 1 can use pool lamile.\n\n293\n00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:57.260\nList 1 says that this inside,\nnow if I had another inside sub net,\n\n294\n00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.847\nI would have to create another\nline in my access list.\n\n295\n00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:05.144\nAnd then again, I just name it the same\nlist and use the same inside source.\n\n296\n00:15:05.144 --> 00:15:07.087\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at this.\n\n297\n00:15:07.087 --> 00:15:12.678\nShow ip nat translations, I'm going\nto see that here's my inside local,\n\n298\n00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:18.283\nin this case,\nit is 10.1.1.100 instead of my 101.1.2.\n\n299\n00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:23.099\nBut nonetheless, it's still went out and\nused the same address,\n\n300\n00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:25.423\nnoticed it used this host here.\n\n301\n00:15:25.423 --> 00:15:27.990\nCuz this was host 100, this is host 101.\n\n302\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.160\nThis guy used five in the pool,\nthis guys use the next one in the pool.\n\n303\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.510\nWhat's the problem here?\n\n304\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.770\nEveryone going out is using\na different global address.\n\n305\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.370\nWe can't do this today.\n\n306\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.830\nWe'll go out and configure it cuz it's\nfun, but you can't do this in real life.\n\n307\n00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.070\nShow ip nat translations.\n\n308\n00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.390\nAll right, it's gonna show me this.\n\n309\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:52.620\nShow ip nat statistics, is actually\nshowing me my active translations.\n\n310\n00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.654\nIt actually shows me a summary\nof my configuration.\n\n311\n00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.059\nI need to remember that from my objective.\n\n312\n00:15:57.059 --> 00:16:01.008\nWhich command shows your summary of\nyour configuration along with the active\n\n313\n00:16:01.008 --> 00:16:04.238\ntranslation services going on\nin that show ip nat statistics.\n\n314\n00:16:04.238 --> 00:16:06.663\nOkay, so I can see my outside,\ninside interfaces.\n\n315\n00:16:06.663 --> 00:16:09.780\nIt also may, someone might ask you,\nshows you your hits, right?\n\n316\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.170\nHow many translations are we doing?\n\n317\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.120\nHow many hits?\n\n318\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.770\nAnd then this goes down\na little bit further.\n\n319\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.090\nSo let's go out and take a look.\n\n320\n00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:24.646\nSo Dynamic Net, I got my inside and\noutside interfaces\n\n321\n00:16:24.646 --> 00:16:30.071\nmarked already, so\nnow I just gotra create a pool.\n\n322\n00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:34.101\nYou wanna say ip net pool,\nand we'll use Lamle,\n\n323\n00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:38.727\n209.165.201.3 space Indian address and\n\n324\n00:16:38.727 --> 00:16:41.890\nI can just give it a couple addresses.\n\n325\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.499\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n326\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.670\nThis is one of the things you\nshould keep in mind here.\n\n327\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.244\nSo netmask.\n\n328\n00:16:47.244 --> 00:16:55.802\n[COUGH] Okay,\n\n329\n00:16:55.802 --> 00:16:59.670\none of the things is they'll\nshow you a drawing possibly.\n\n330\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.680\nAnd they'll say to you, some of\nthese hosts get on the internet, but\n\n331\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.380\nthese over here can't get on the internet.\n\n332\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.920\nWell that's when you run over here and\ncheck your pool and\n\n333\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.160\nmake sure you have enough addresses.\n\n334\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.190\nMaybe your pool's only a block size of\neight, which only gives you six hosts and\n\n335\n00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.460\nyou notice you have like ten hosts or\nsomething like that.\n\n336\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.750\nSo that's when if you get something\nlike that, check your pool.\n\n337\n00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.980\nNow that's only if you're\ndoing Dynamic Net,\n\n338\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.980\nright, which in real life\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n339\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.020\nI'm not saying it couldn't\nhappen on the CCNA.\n\n340\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.960\nSo I created my pool and I gave\nmyself about 10 or 11 addresses here.\n\n341\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.390\nip net inside source list 1,\nand I can do this in any order.\n\n342\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.170\nCan use pool Lamnle and then I\n\n343\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.198\nhave to create my access list.\n\n344\n00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:48.890\nPermit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255, that's it.\n\n345\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.155\nThree lines.\n\n346\n00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:53.590\nCreated my pool, say who can use my pool,\ncreate the access list and\n\n347\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.660\nthen of course you have\nyour interface markets.\n\n348\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.290\nLet's go back out here and\nlet's telnet to the internet.\n\n349\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.070\nYou like that?\nThat's a ping that, we can ping first.\n\n350\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.120\nAnd then we'll telnet.\n\n351\n00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.650\nAnd i'm on the internet.\n\n352\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.170\nIf it was only that easy.\n\n353\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.720\nShow IP net trans.\n\n354\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.340\nAnd there we can see right\nhere was my ping, using ICMP.\n\n355\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.590\nAnd notice my inside local.\n\n356\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.480\nMy inside global,\n\n357\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.770\nI'm using the same address to get out,\n201.3, the first one in the pool.\n\n358\n00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.600\nIf someone else came in,\nthey'd use the next address.\n\n359\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.910\nThat's the problem with this.\n\n360\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.659\nThis is really close to our PAT.\n\n361\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.090\nAnd the only difference is,\nin that overload,\n\n362\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:41.000\nthe only difference is every host going\nout must have its own IP address here.\n\n363\n00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.130\nAll right, so we can see here\nthat I'm using this address.\n\n364\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.986\nI can see ISMP,\nthere's my telnet session, right?\n\n365\n00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:48.019\nSo let's go back in here.\n\n366\n00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:50.540\nThe only thing I'm gonna take out of here,\ncheck this out.\n\n367\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.760\nI can leave that pool, interesting enough,\nand still do my next line,\n\n368\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.350\nmy next thing which is nat overload.\n\n369\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.400\nI'm gonna come up here to\nmy- it's this command here.\n\n370\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.510\nThis is the command I have to\nchange to do nat overload.\n\n371\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.580\nI'm gonna do Ctrl-A,\nno, and let's go back.\n\n372\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.110\nYeah, I'm gonna delete it.\n\n373\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.410\nSo, I just lost my connections, right?\n\n374\n00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.870\nI'm gonna show you how to piss everybody\noff on a Monday morning here coming up, so\n\n375\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.200\nstick around.\n\n376\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.605\nLearn how to abuse your users.\n\n377\n00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:21.930\n[LAUGH] We teach them a lot here.\n\n378\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.425\n>> Yeah,\nyour vocabulary is expanding, Todd.\n\n379\n00:19:24.425 --> 00:19:26.944\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, to configure PAT,\n\n380\n00:19:26.944 --> 00:19:29.830\niIt's basically the same\nthing as Dynamic Net.\n\n381\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.390\nWe still can create a pool but\nwe don't need to.\n\n382\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.640\nOn this case here check this out.\n\n383\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.360\nActually I'm gonna delete my pool\nbecause I'm gonna do it this way.\n\n384\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.400\nThis is the way the to configure\nPAT today cuz it's easy.\n\n385\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.350\nI have this at my home office.\n\n386\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.450\nIn my office in Texas,\na lot of people just use it like this.\n\n387\n00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:50.300\nFirst off, when you get an address\nfrom your ISP you can't call and\n\n388\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.050\nsay, well I need a pool for my NAT.\n\n389\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.380\nThey'll go what's wrong with you man?\n\n390\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.510\nYou don't need a pool for your NAT,\nthat's like so 1999 or 2001, come on.\n\n391\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:05.820\nWe can use the outside\nlocal as my inside global.\n\n392\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.028\nDid I just blow your [SOUND], right?\n\n393\n00:20:09.028 --> 00:20:11.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That just kills you, right?\n\n394\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Where's that tequila when you need it?\n\n395\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.280\n>> It's waiting for you.\n\n396\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.470\n>> I'm telling you, I'm getting some.\n\n397\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.850\nOutside local is my router\ninterface get out, and\n\n398\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.820\nwe'll see that in a second\nwith this configuration.\n\n399\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.820\nMy inside local is my\naddress before translation.\n\n400\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.980\nInside global is the address I'm\ngonna use to get onto the internet.\n\n401\n00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.150\nThe outside local is gonna be refered to\nin this piece as my router interface.\n\n402\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.970\nNow, I don't have an address for\neveryone to get out on to the internet, so\n\n403\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.890\nwe are gonna use our outside\nlocal as our inside global.\n\n404\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.480\nMeaning that we are going to\ntranslate using my outside\n\n405\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.580\ninterface that connects to my ISP.\n\n406\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.570\nThis is the way it is pretty much done.\n\n407\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.120\nActually, what makes this so\n\n408\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.630\nnice is certainly we need the access\nlist that permit our inside.\n\n409\n00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.800\nOne, we need a line for every interface.\n\n410\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.920\nIf you had a ten,\nI could do just one line, everyone for\n\n411\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.090\nten could use the interface.\n\n412\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.920\nSo, this says access one, permit right\nhere, and then I just use one line.\n\n413\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.320\nI don't create a pool here, so\nI'm gonna go back and delete my pool.\n\n414\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.640\nIP now inside source list one\ncan use interface, in this case,\n\n415\n00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.400\ngig one gig zero one out here,\nand overload it.\n\n416\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.190\nDon't forget to mark each of your\ninterfaces, but I can do this in one line.\n\n417\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.930\nSee, the less I have to type.\n\n418\n00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:24.920\nThe better right?\n\n419\n00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.490\nI'm always looking for ways, how do I get\nthis done, but not really work, right?\n\n420\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.605\nThat's kind of my mantra in life.\n\n421\n00:21:30.605 --> 00:21:32.380\n[Laughs] A little less the better.\n\n422\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.590\nAnd we'll take a look at\nthe configurations here, it goes this way.\n\n423\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.572\nSo we're going to come over here.\n\n424\n00:21:36.572 --> 00:21:44.720\nAll right, so let's do this, and\nokay we got rid of that one.\n\n425\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.170\nNeed the access list, got rid of that.\n\n426\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.610\nThere's my pool right there,\nso I'm gonna do a Ctrl+A, no.\n\n427\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.000\nAnd now I have no pool.\n\n428\n00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.240\nI have my access list and\nmy interface markings.\n\n429\n00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.503\nSo all I have to do now is create\none line, ip nat inside source List\n\n430\n00:22:00.503 --> 00:22:05.576\n1 can use interface,\nin this case it's zero one zero on mine,\n\n431\n00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:10.458\nand the key word here because this\nis the same one of these with\n\n432\n00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:16.106\nDynamic Net when we had the pool is\nthis word right here in the command,\n\n433\n00:22:16.106 --> 00:22:22.910\nthat's why i got rid of this verse, and\ni could have kept the pool by the way.\n\n434\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.090\nBut i want to show you this,\ni could of used the pool and why and\n\n435\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.700\nnow I'm gonna overload it.\n\n436\n00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.710\nThat means use one IP address for\n\n437\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:35.810\neveryone to get out by using their source\nport number to differentiate from them.\n\n438\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.090\nOkay, now why didn't I use the pool,\nor why would I use the pool,\n\n439\n00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.270\nwhy wouldn't I use this?\n\n440\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.480\nChances are you're probably gonna use this\ncuz this'll let 60.000 users get out,\n\n441\n00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.810\nbasically using one IP address.\n\n442\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:47.460\nIs that true?\n\n443\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.920\nKind of, theoretically.\n\n444\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.260\nThe point is is, you guys ever go to\nMicrosoft or something like that and\n\n445\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.110\nturn on the analyzer?\n\n446\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.450\nIf you haven't, that's what you need\nto do, that's how we learn this stuff.\n\n447\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.400\nTurn on the analyzer and\n\n448\n00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.390\ntell me how many source ports did you\nopen up when you went to Microsoft?\n\n449\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.440\nWell if you cook a couple\nof those URL's in there,\n\n450\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.590\nit's going to be like ten, maybe 20 ports.\n\n451\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.586\nSo if you had 10,000 users, you will\nrun out of addresses to get out, right,\n\n452\n00:23:08.586 --> 00:23:11.230\nwven with 10,000 users or\nsomething like that.\n\n453\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.770\nAnd you're like, well that's crazy.\n\n454\n00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.350\nYes!\n\n455\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.880\nI've seen it.\nI've had customers that do it.\n\n456\n00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.830\nAll right.\n\n457\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.440\nSo that's what we'd use the pool and\nget something from the ISP now.\n\n458\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.900\nIt's gonna be another global range.\n\n459\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.530\nIt doesn't have to do anything with this.\n\n460\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.916\nWe have to get it from our ISP, so\nwe can't just make up addresses.\n\n461\n00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:26.491\n[LAUGH] We could.\n[LAUGH].\n\n462\n00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:27.540\nBe fun.\n>> Not easily.\n\n463\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.670\n>> But this is way you'd have at least\ntwo addresses, so if someone goes out and\n\n464\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.600\ngets a TC/IP reset, or a Nack because\nthat source port number is in use,\n\n465\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.160\nwhen they talk to the translation router,\nnow, it's gonna go back and\n\n466\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.580\nuse the next pool in the range.\n\n467\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.360\nNow, I just doubled the amount of users\nI can get out with that same one, or\n\n468\n00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.900\nthe amount of sessions I can\nget out with that interface.\n\n469\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.350\nIn this case here,\nI just overloaded it here.\n\n470\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:53.090\nSo everyone can get out using\njust the IP address on interface,\n\n471\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.780\nwhat I have here, my outside interface.\n\n472\n00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.280\nOkay?\n\n473\n00:23:57.852 --> 00:24:00.580\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and ping.\n\n474\n00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.135\nNo, you guys can't see that, that's okay.\n\n475\n00:24:05.021 --> 00:24:11.639\nOkay, so let's go ahead and do And now,\n\n476\n00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:17.050\neven though we saw our port numbers\nbefore, notice my inside global.\n\n477\n00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.910\nNotice this right here.\n\n478\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.700\nThis is my address I'm getting out.\n\n479\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.630\nMy outside local is still showing up as,\nand\n\n480\n00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.290\nalso my global adds the destination, but\n\n481\n00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:32.800\nwe are using my outside local as my inside\nbecause there is my interface right there.\n\n482\n00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.910\nSo I said use interface serial 010 in this\nexample, and that's what it is doing.\n\n483\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.560\nSo here is my inside local and\ninside global, and\n\n484\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.060\nthese are my port numbers that\nit's going to keep tracking me.\n\n485\n00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.190\nNow if I had more than one user,\n\n486\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.240\nthey would probably look a little bit\nbetter here because I would be able to see\n\n487\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.050\nthat I am using the same inside global\naddress for everyone to get out, right?\n\n488\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.360\nBut I only have the one host, so\nit's not big deal, but let's do this.\n\n489\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.290\nShow IP net translations, okay,\n\n490\n00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.350\nand oops, sorry I did that, I meant,\nnot translations, statistics.\n\n491\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.800\nSo, this is the important one.\n\n492\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.610\nThis is the one that we're\ngoing to ask you about and\n\n493\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.060\nsay, which one will show you the hits?\n\n494\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.670\nThe summary of the configuration and\nthe translation.\n\n495\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.570\nSo, it's show IP NAT statistics.\n\n496\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.180\nShows me the total active translations,\npeak translations.\n\n497\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.920\nI had a whole three,\nmy outside interfaces,\n\n498\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.350\nnotice I have a few other things here,\nthe access list.\n\n499\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.760\nSo, I get a summary of my configuration,\n\n500\n00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.480\nhow many translations there are,\nas well as my interfaces.\n\n501\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.830\nAnd the number of hits, this is a pretty\ngood command, need to remember this.\n\n502\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.150\nNow, let's say it's Monday morning,\nand you have some bad coffee.\n\n503\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.870\nYou didn't get your Starbucks, and\n\n504\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.760\nyou just want everyone to be in\nthe same bad mood as you are, right?\n\n505\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.478\nI can help you out.\n\n506\n00:25:41.478 --> 00:25:42.088\nDo this.\n\n507\n00:25:42.088 --> 00:25:44.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Clear ip net\n\n508\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:51.870\ntranslations, and you just knocked\neveryone off the internet.\n\n509\n00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.200\nThe power at your fingertips\nis amazing with this command.\n\n510\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.340\nAll right, if you do that, don't tell\nyour boss I told you to do that.\n\n511\n00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.970\nI'm not going to get\nsued because you do that.\n\n512\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.200\nYou're on your own if you did that,\nall right?\n\n513\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.840\nSo if I did show ip net translations.\n\n514\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.510\nSee what happens?\n\n515\n00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.620\nEveryone needs a cup of\nStarbucks in the morning.\n\n516\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.495\nSo, notice there's nothing there.\n\n517\n00:26:10.495 --> 00:26:13.120\n30,000 users, if that's what I had,\nbada bing and bada boom, and\n\n518\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.800\nthey are gone, right?\n\n519\n00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.190\nNow, they're not really going\nto notice all that much,\n\n520\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.510\nbecause their host will\njust make another session.\n\n521\n00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.840\nBut nonetheless,\nyou are going to disturb your network.\n\n522\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.120\nSo kind of be careful with that command,\nI think, right?\n\n523\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.140\nLet me see if, I think, troubleshooting,\ndebug, I want to do this, debug IP nat.\n\n524\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.020\nNow, debug IP nat is great.\n\n525\n00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.850\nHowever, you really can't do this in\nproduction because you're going to see\n\n526\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:36.770\nso much traffic.\n\n527\n00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.520\nSo, the only time we are going to\nbe using this command is if you\n\n528\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.210\nare having a problem.\n\n529\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.080\nSo, let me go back out here and\nI'm going to,\n\n530\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.340\nlet me just ping,\nI really didn't have to do anything, it.\n\n531\n00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.130\nOkay, it recreated the, as soon as I\npress enter, it recreated the session.\n\n532\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.540\nAll right.\nSo, it'd automatically do it.\n\n533\n00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.730\nAnd most people wouldn't, so\nlook at this, inside local.\n\n534\n00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:02.130\nInside global, outside global, outside\nglobal, inside global, inside local.\n\n535\n00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.100\nSee how it went out and came back?\n\n536\n00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.890\nRight.\nSo you do some like this if you had a,\n\n537\n00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.530\nthis will tell you if you\nhad a routing problem.\n\n538\n00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.330\nSo you do debugging in you see inside\nlocal, inside global, outside global.\n\n539\n00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.160\nBut then you wouldn't say come back,\nright?\n\n540\n00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.760\nYou just see it happen over and\nover and over again.\n\n541\n00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.710\nThat means,\nit doesn't know how to get back to you.\n\n542\n00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.610\nSo basically, it's just telling you\nthat you have a routing problem.\n\n543\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.490\nThe reason I'm using that,\nbecause I've seen a lot.\n\n544\n00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.380\nAll right.\n\n545\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.720\nI think that's about it, Ronnie.\n\n546\n00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.220\nI think we're looking good, man.\n\n547\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.310\nOkay, one last thing, guys.\n\n548\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.490\nOne last thing on this.\n\n549\n00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.200\nWe want to read my chapter,\nyou want to do this,\n\n550\n00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.870\nyou want to go through\nthe verification commands,\n\n551\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:38.730\nyou want to troubleshoot this,\ndebug ipnet, show ipnet statistics.\n\n552\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.640\nShow ipnet translations, right?\n\n553\n00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.840\nAnd then you're going to go through,\non Lammle.com you're going to go\n\n554\n00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.870\nthrough the NAT pool of questions,\nNAT pool will get it, questions.\n\n555\n00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.310\n>> And then on the Sybex study guide,\nwe're on chapter 13,\n\n556\n00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.030\nwith one more chapter to go.\n\n557\n00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.530\nAnd so, that's going to be IPv6, but\nin this case here, review questions,\n\n558\n00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.390\nwritten labs, Lammle.com,\nand you're good to go.\n\n559\n00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.440\nThere's some good objectives in here\nthat you really need to go over.\n\n560\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.280\nAll right, well, thank you, Todd, for\nreminding us of these net concepts for\n\n561\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.970\nnetwork address translation.\n\n562\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.460\nRemember that what we also saw\nhere in this episode right,\n\n563\n00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.880\nis really the foundations of NAT.\n\n564\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.180\nWe've talked about static NAT,\nas well as dynamic NAT, and\n\n565\n00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.700\neven pat or port address translation.\n\n566\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.350\nSometimes you also here the term NAT\noverload, if you haven't heard that term.\n\n567\n00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.280\nRemember that we also saw\nthose configurations as well.\n\n568\n00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.790\nAnd the easy set up right away that Todd\nshowed us is configure those interfaces\n\n569\n00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.280\nfirst for your NAT outside,\nand of course your NAT inside.\n\n570\n00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.020\nAnd then, essentially the differences\nare just one or two different lines.\n\n571\n00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.290\nSo make sure you review that concept too.\n\n572\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.470\nAnd at the end there, we also saw some of\nthe different commands that will help us\n\n573\n00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:52.140\nto troubleshoot NAT as well as using those\nnat statistics, if I remember right.\n\n574\n00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.740\n>> Show IP nat translation,\nshow IP nat statistics.\n\n575\n00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.840\n>> Yeah, nat statistics.\n\n576\n00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.140\n>> And debug ip nat\n>> And debug ip nat and\n\n577\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.601\nthen the clear ip [LAUGH] no,\ndon't do that one.\n\n578\n00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.234\n>> Yeah,\nwe're not going to repeat that one.\n\n579\n00:29:02.234 --> 00:29:03.550\n>> Yeah, don't so that one.\n\n580\n00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.900\nAnd if you do\n>> Now do it.\n\n581\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.308\n>> If you do, Todd@lamly.com\n>> Yeah,\n\n582\n00:29:07.308 --> 00:29:11.850\njust wait until you get your pink-slip,\nthen type in cleariptranslation@ right?\n\n583\n00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.960\n>> All right,\nwell that's also a great place for\n\n584\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.870\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n585\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.630\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n586\n00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:25.385\n>> And Todd Lamly\n>> Come back for more CCAENT\n\n587\n00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:31.593\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.662\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're gonna be going into ICND1.\n\n4\n00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:23.449\nFocusing in extremely on the exam\nobjectives themselves and\n\n5\n00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.660\nwho better to help us do that than Mr.\nTodd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.100\nTodd, welcome back to the studios.\n\n7\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.870\n>> Thank you Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.680\nIt's good to be back after nice lunch,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.090\nWe're gonna dive right into the objectives\nfor managing a Cisco inter network.\n\n10\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.090\nThese were okay objectives in the last\nexam in the new exam that just\n\n11\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.500\ncame out they're gonna push these a little\nbit further because they remove some other\n\n12\n00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.030\nobjectives, they're adding more into this\none with licensing and Cis Log, right?\n\n13\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.550\nThose were all new into the C sent, right?\n\n14\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.000\nSo we've got a little bit more in\nthis chapter than we had before.\n\n15\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000\nLet's take a look.\n\n16\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.460\nFirst off let's go into\nsome more detail about\n\n17\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970\nwhat I went through in the last episode,\nthe Router as a Computer.\n\n18\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.360\nSo first off, we'll check over here.\n\n19\n00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.140\nSo we're gonna check, the first thing\nwe're gonna do is the Router is gonna boot\n\n20\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.820\nup and it's gonna check\nthe configuration register Boot Field.\n\n21\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.710\nWhat's the default on this?\n\n22\n00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.950\nRight, the default Boot Field\ndown here 0x2102, right?\n\n23\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.353\nSo remember 2100 if we can see that.\n\n24\n00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:29.072\n2100 was Rom monitor mode.\n\n25\n00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:32.570\n21 0 sorry yeah, rom monitor mode, 2101.\n\n26\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.730\nThe mini IOS which we don't really have\nanymore and then 2102 the default, right?\n\n27\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.940\nSo we can either check the register\nfield and go into rom mode.\n\n28\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.000\nAnd boot the Cisco IOS manually,\nyou can do that.\n\n29\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.640\nWe typically don't do it that way.\n\n30\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.020\nThe other thing is, check this out.\n\n31\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.840\nCheck boot commands and\nload Cisco IOS images.\n\n32\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.690\nThis is something I didn't\nmention in the last episode.\n\n33\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.700\nSo what happens is, once we check the\nconfiguration register, instead of loading\n\n34\n00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.180\nthe Cisco IOS, we're gonna come up here\nand look for the boot system commands.\n\n35\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.803\nI'm gonna come back to that but basically\nthis is gonna override the configuration\n\n36\n00:02:08.803 --> 00:02:10.365\nregister and load a different IOS.\n\n37\n00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:11.480\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n38\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.010\nNo boot command?\n\n39\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.070\nWe'll load back here,\nload the first IOS in flash in to RAM.\n\n40\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.840\nExport it into RAM.\n\n41\n00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.800\nSo the first Cisco IOS image, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.730\nNow, if it doesn't find one there\nit will broadcast looking for\n\n43\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.010\na TFTP server seeing if there's\none connected to one of your LANs.\n\n44\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.180\nAnd if so it will try to load that,\nif not you end up in ROMMON, right.\n\n45\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.436\nSo that's probably a bad thing to see on\na Monday morning in production, right.\n\n46\n00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:41.090\nNow so again we have our post test, right.\n\n47\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.170\nLoad the post test, come down here and\nload the bootstrap that says go to flash,\n\n48\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.405\nload the first iOS into RAM.\n\n49\n00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:53.000\nCome to NVRAM, look for\nstartup config, load that into RAM and\n\n50\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.920\nname it running-config, that's,\nwe're gonna change that when\n\n51\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.090\nwe get to boot system commands so\nwe're gonna come back to this, stand by.\n\n52\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.520\nNow to backup the Cisco IOS and Config\ncopy flash, now be careful over here.\n\n53\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.300\nWhen we're talking about the IOS\nwe're using the term flash.\n\n54\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.025\nNow there are different ways that\nwe're gonna do this today, right?\n\n55\n00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:16.320\nWe've got FTP, secure copy protocol SCP,\nthese are other ways to do it too.\n\n56\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.910\nAnd the reason we would do something like\nFTP or SCP today and finally they got\n\n57\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.640\nsomething that eject other than TFTP\nis because we have larger files now.\n\n58\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.899\nAnd I think TFTP is about, I think\n64 megs is as, 32 megs actually is,\n\n59\n00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:34.770\ncuz I think its limit that people say\ndon't do more than 32 megs with TFTP.\n\n60\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.324\nWell we have much bigger iOS' now today.\n\n61\n00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:42.050\n#copy flash tftp, so\nwe're using the word flash here,\n\n62\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.580\nright, or\nwe're talking about the iOS, right.\n\n63\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.657\nSo although I can copy a configuration\nof flash and store it for myself.\n\n64\n00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:52.827\nIt's not the default for\nthe objectives, right?\n\n65\n00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:55.670\nFlash is for the IOS and the objectives.\n\n66\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.440\nCopyflashtftp.\n\n67\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.970\nNow to copy the configuration first\nwe want to do is copy run start,\n\n68\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.730\nremember the write mem is just wr,\nI love that.\n\n69\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.910\nOkay?\nCopy start run,\n\n70\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.920\nthat's a merge copy run tftp.\n\n71\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640\nThat's gonna copy a full\ncopy to the FTP server and\n\n72\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.240\nthen we can merge it\nback the copy tftp run.\n\n73\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.930\nDon't really use this one too much anymore\nbut you can, and you can automatically do\n\n74\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.060\nthat when someone logs in it automatically\ncopies the config to a TFTP server.\n\n75\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.820\nIt's a very cool feature because if they\ndo something then we automatically know\n\n76\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.590\nwho did it cuz we have\nan external authentication and\n\n77\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.320\nthen we can take the configuration back.\n\n78\n00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.120\nNow to see all the files in flash memory,\nwe do a show flash, don't we?\n\n79\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.430\nShow flash.\n\n80\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.310\nTo see which one's running, show version.\n\n81\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.210\nWell let me run out and\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n82\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.169\nI talked about it.\n\n83\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.660\nBut let's go out and let's take a look\nhere, well there's my corp right here.\n\n84\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.740\nOkay, take a look here.\n\n85\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.739\nShow flash, all files in flash memory.\n\n86\n00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:02.759\nOkay?\nAnd it's of 2,800, right, but\n\n87\n00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.910\nwe're running 1,514,\nknow if you guys can see this.\n\n88\n00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.030\nYeah kind of.\n\n89\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.156\n45 megs in length,\nthis is a pretty good size file isn't it?\n\n90\n00:05:14.156 --> 00:05:20.980\n[COUGH] Okay, 45 megs,\nthat's a pretty good size iOS, 45 megs.\n\n91\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.110\nBut remember, and we're gonna get\nto the iOSs, is that we copy,\n\n92\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.890\nwhen we get to the 15 code we're copying\nevery service into the flash one file.\n\n93\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.080\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n94\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.870\nAnyways, we can see that I only have one\nfile so obviously I'm running that IOS,\n\n95\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.760\nright, so I could do a show version and\nit'll tell me a couple things.\n\n96\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.856\nAdvanced IP security 15.1.\n\n97\n00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:45.129\nThe bootstrap, don't get that\nconfused with your iOS version,\n\n98\n00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.450\nwhich from flash, right,\nwe're loaded right here.\n\n99\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.260\nSo if I look right here,\nflash 15 1, M6.bin.\n\n100\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.400\nHow long has the router been running,\nand how was it last booted?\n\n101\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.940\nAnd then at the end,\nwe're gonna have our post test and\n\n102\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.450\nthen finally our license information.\n\n103\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.980\nBut here's our post test, looks like we\nhave 256 megs of RAM and 64 megs of flash.\n\n104\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.480\nRight?\n\n105\n00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.110\nOkay?\n\n106\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.694\nNow in the show flash here, one of\nthe things I'm gonna do here because I\n\n107\n00:06:16.694 --> 00:06:19.708\ncan draw on this,\nlet's take a look at this for a minute.\n\n108\n00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:22.355\nFirst off,\nI have the different file names.\n\n109\n00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.165\nWe can see these aren't bin files.\n\n110\n00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:27.615\nNow, they don't have to be listed as dot\nbin, they know they're bio executable, but\n\n111\n00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:29.705\nin this case here we\nknow they're xml files.\n\n112\n00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:31.685\nWe're not going to use\nthose to load our iOS with.\n\n113\n00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:33.235\nSo, we only have the one.\n\n114\n00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:34.965\nNow, that being said check this out.\n\n115\n00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:37.255\nI want you guys to see something for\nthe objectives.\n\n116\n00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:39.705\nSo, I see here there's one,\ntwo, three, one, two,\n\n117\n00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:43.970\nthree, there's 33 megs used in flash.\n\n118\n00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.210\nBut hold on, this one has more.\n\n119\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.020\nThis looks like 256 k of flash, right?\n\n120\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.056\nSo we have 256 k and\nit looks like we have 221 megs available.\n\n121\n00:06:57.056 --> 00:06:58.031\nThat's a lot, right?\n\n122\n00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:02.400\nSo we have 221 megs at a 256 megs total,\nokay.\n\n123\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.190\nRemember we don't see it all cuz it's\npartitioned off into NDRAM as well, right.\n\n124\n00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.620\nBut none the less we're gonna come in\nhere and show flash so we can understand.\n\n125\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.620\nSo if you see something like\nthis on the objectives,\n\n126\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.640\nthey're gonna show you\nsomething like this and say,\n\n127\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.130\nhey you've got a file with a 64\nmeg iOS you wanna put in here.\n\n128\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:24.030\nAnd you say copy flash, or\ncopy SCP, whatever, into flash.\n\n129\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.530\nOkay?\n\n130\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.620\nAnd, so you're copying a file, and\nthey're gonna say what happens?\n\n131\n00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.420\nWell, this is when you come in here,\nand you look, and\n\n132\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.820\nyou have to see how much is available.\n\n133\n00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.090\nWell, man, we have 221 megs available.\n\n134\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.930\nWe have plenty.\n\n135\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.212\nBut if that said something like 32\nmegs available, and you're copying 64,\n\n136\n00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:40.525\nwhat do you think would happen?\n\n137\n00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:44.450\nYou're copying a bigger IOS\nthan you have room in flash.\n\n138\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.465\nSo it's going to prompt you,\nwould you like to erase flash?\n\n139\n00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:48.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n140\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.775\nThe answer is, sure, why not?\n\n141\n00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:51.662\nYou want to be careful there.\n\n142\n00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:53.617\nBut, nonetheless, that's what it will do.\n\n143\n00:07:53.617 --> 00:07:57.263\nIf you have more room in there, like\nthis one here, your answer would be E.\n\n144\n00:07:57.263 --> 00:07:58.541\nNothing happens.\n\n145\n00:07:58.541 --> 00:07:59.995\nIt copies the flash.\n\n146\n00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:02.920\nIf it comes in there and\nthe flash is smaller than that IOS,\n\n147\n00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.830\nit'll prompt you to erase flash.\n\n148\n00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:10.700\nAll right, to copy an IOS to a TFTP host,\nin this case here,\n\n149\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.910\npretty simple, just use TFTP here,\ncopy flash to a TFTP host.\n\n150\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.230\nPretty darn simple.\n\n151\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.040\nOkay, and\nthen it's gonna ask you the IOS file name,\n\n152\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.890\nand this can be a switch or router,\nright, I just happen to be on a Router,\n\n153\n00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.350\nI might have done this on a switch\nI don't know it's a Router.\n\n154\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.510\nAnyways, address or name or remote host,\nthis is my tftp host, right or\n\n155\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.370\nFTP host or STP whatever it\nis that I'm using or by USB.\n\n156\n00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.180\nAnyways, destination file\nname are gonna come the same.\n\n157\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.780\nNow notice that it's in brackets here,\n\n158\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.870\nwhat this means if you press\nEnter that's your default.\n\n159\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.500\nNow I could rename that testa IOS.\n\n160\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.520\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n161\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.875\nYou don't even have to\nput the .ben on it right?\n\n162\n00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:54.700\nIt'll actually run okay, so\nit doesn't matter what it is.\n\n163\n00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.200\nNow hold on I got a question for you guys.\n\n164\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.630\nCopy flash tftp it takes off.\n\n165\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.380\nAnd I'm seeing these bangs, right.\n\n166\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.240\nExclamation points are referred\nto as bangs in the coding.\n\n167\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.028\nWhat are those bangs?\n\n168\n00:09:05.028 --> 00:09:08.180\nWhat is that?\n\n169\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.560\n>> It's the time it takes to process it?\n\n170\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.430\n>> For every two packets that I send,\nI get a bang.\n\n171\n00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.760\nWait a minute, I have a question.\n\n172\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.099\nThat sounds like an acknowledgment.\n\n173\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.560\nI thought TFTP was connectionless.\n\n174\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.180\nIsn't TFTP connectionless?\n\n175\n00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.780\nEveryone's been saying that for\nI don't know, 30 years.\n\n176\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.600\nIs that true?\n\n177\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.200\nNo it is not.\n\n178\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.210\nTFTP is connection oriented.\n\n179\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:37.020\nWhat everyone gets confused about is TFTP\nis connectionless at the transport layer.\n\n180\n00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.230\nAt the application layer, the program is\nconnection oriented, and we get responses\n\n181\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.200\nbased on the acknowledgment from\nthe application, from the client.\n\n182\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.800\nOkay, so whenever,\nthat's a good party trick right there.\n\n183\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.411\n>> Yeah.\n>> As you know,\n\n184\n00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.040\nif you're doing whatever those games are,\nas a drinking game or whatever.\n\n185\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.898\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is TFTP connection [INAUDIBLE] your\n\n186\n00:09:53.898 --> 00:09:55.296\nconnection list, now you can win too.\n\n187\n00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:56.120\nAll right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.750\n>> TFTP server software must be\n\n189\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.500\nrunning on PC.\n\n190\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.770\nThe PC must be on the same subnet.\n\n191\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.073\nI don't think I'd play that\ngame with you [LAUGH].\n\n192\n00:10:05.073 --> 00:10:06.659\n>> [LAUGH] Come on.\n\n193\n00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:10.480\nYou would have probably been\ndrinking on this one here.\n\n194\n00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.760\n>> Yeah I would have been drinking a lot.\n\n195\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.019\n>> I'll just pull out some questions man.\n\n196\n00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:18.510\nAll right, now to copy it back or\nto copy and upgrade,\n\n197\n00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.780\nI'm gonna say copy tftp to flash,\nso I'm putting something in.\n\n198\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.130\nIn this case here, we were what,\nwe were copying flash tftp,\n\n199\n00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.080\nwe were backing it up, so\nwe were pushing that back.\n\n200\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.285\nSo we wouldn't get a prompt that says\nwould you like to erase flash, right,\n\n201\n00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:32.390\nbecause we're putting it on a tftp server.\n\n202\n00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.680\nIn this case here, oops.\n\n203\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.059\nCopy tftp flash.\n\n204\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.720\nAddress, this is my TFTP\nhost in this example.\n\n205\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.090\nAll right?\n\n206\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.000\nSource, file name.\n\n207\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.320\nDestination file name.\n\n208\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.700\nNow, how do I get that file name?\n\n209\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.732\nWhy do a show flash, highlight it,\nright click copy, paste it in here?\n\n210\n00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.541\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not typing all that out, right?\n\n211\n00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:53.420\nSo, copy-paste is your friend in this.\n\n212\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.940\nDestination's the same.\n\n213\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.749\nNotice here's my TFTP server, right?\n\n214\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.940\nAnd then notice this right here.\n\n215\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.790\nErase flash before, so\nyou're like erase flash,\n\n216\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.950\nI don't have enough room to put this\nin there, absolutely gonna erase it.\n\n217\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.770\nNow one of the things you could\ndo is go out and do a show flash.\n\n218\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.825\nAnd then you could say erase\nflash don't press Enter.\n\n219\n00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:19.810\n[LAUGH] Erase slash colon\nquestion mark right?\n\n220\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.740\nAnd then see what's in there.\n\n221\n00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.950\nMaybe erase something that you don't need,\nso you have enough room so\n\n222\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.120\nit doesn't erase it.\n\n223\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.960\nAll right, anyways erase flash and\nnotice that it's erasing here,\n\n224\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.360\nand then it goes out there and\nlooks for it and tries to download it.\n\n225\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.271\nHopefully it'll find it.\n\n226\n00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:35.729\nTo have the router boot an IOS\nimage from another source,\n\n227\n00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:38.040\nwe're gonna use the boot system command.\n\n228\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.570\nRemember from that first slide we had the\nboot system command, because I loaded now\n\n229\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.470\nanother IOS in the flash, and then I said\nboot system and told it to use that one.\n\n230\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.540\nWell now it's loaded twice,\nit's listed second,\n\n231\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.420\nwe only load the first one by default.\n\n232\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:56.120\nSo let's go all the way back here,\nand we're going to now so\n\n233\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.940\nwhen the router boots up,\nI'm gonna go look in the startup config.\n\n234\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.460\nIt's in the first few lines of the startup\nconfig if you do a boot system.\n\n235\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.974\nSo actually the bootstrap goes and\nlooks into the startup config,\n\n236\n00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:11.210\nright, in MVRAM and looks for\nthe boot system commands.\n\n237\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.440\nIf it finds them,\nthen it's gonna go ahead and load it.\n\n238\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.550\nIf not,\nit's gonna say no boot system command, so\n\n239\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.190\nright here it would load it if not,\nthen we're gonna go this way, right?\n\n240\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.980\nSo if we come back over here, that\nchanges kinda this over here, doesn't it?\n\n241\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.710\nPerform POST, Bootstrap, in this case\nhere if we have what really happens, and\n\n242\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:33.200\nI didn't mention this, is the Bootstrap\ncomes over here and looks in NVRAM.\n\n243\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.390\nThat's the first step, right?\n\n244\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.900\nThe bootstrap does.\n\n245\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.400\nAnd see it's a boot system.\n\n246\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.070\nIf that doesn't work it's gonna go okay,\nI'm gonna go to flash and look for\n\n247\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.990\nthat file.\n\n248\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:47.570\nNow, if it doesn't find anything\nthere then it's gonna open up and\n\n249\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.370\nbroadcast looking for TFTP server.\n\n250\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.400\nAlright, it's going to broadcast\nlooking to see if I can find it.\n\n251\n00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.010\nSo if something's connected directly\nto your LAN, it would load it.\n\n252\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.040\nAnd if you have nothing to\ndo on a rainy Saturday or\n\n253\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.560\nsomething like that, there's your RAM.\n\n254\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.790\nAlright, boot system commands,\nnow on the way we get here,\n\n255\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.100\nwe get to load the IMAP, can't get it,\nthe FTTP fails, and it's kind of funny, so\n\n256\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.450\nlisten to what they say here.\n\n257\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.670\nIf the IOS in Flash is corrupt or missing\nand no network connectivity is available.\n\n258\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.040\nSo I couldn't get my Flash, right?\n\n259\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.220\nI have no network connectivity to\na TFTP server, that's what that means.\n\n260\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.496\nAnd the default fallback receiver fails\nall the way, there was nothing to load.\n\n261\n00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:36.470\nOkay, the router will enter\nROM monitor mode, right?\n\n262\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.630\nSo again, this isn't necessarily a bad\nthing unless you walk in MOnday morning,\n\n263\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.780\nyou've had a long weekend, maybe you\nwere up a little late, you come in,\n\n264\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.280\nand you're planning on just\nlooking at the news on online.\n\n265\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.570\nWell, your day's not\ngonna be quite that good.\n\n266\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.090\nAnyways, so\nwe're gonna be in ROM mon mode.\n\n267\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.990\nNow, let's just go from here,\nand how do you fix this?\n\n268\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.340\nWell, type for this end.\n\n269\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.898\nYou're gonna type this,\nI don't have it listed here, tfttpdnld,\n\n270\n00:14:02.898 --> 00:14:06.360\nthat stands for to be download obviously.\n\n271\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.150\nType that in, and it's going to\ncome back and give you an error.\n\n272\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.080\nIt's pretty funny.\n\n273\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.550\nIt says what, I can't do that.\n\n274\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.470\nYou didn't type in all these parameters.\n\n275\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.090\nAnd it shows you everything\nyou're supposed to type in.\n\n276\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.970\nSo you're like, cool.\n\n277\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.650\nSo I'll just type all those parameters\nin and then press tftp download again.\n\n278\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.150\nAnd you just have to be connected to\nthe server, and you're back in business.\n\n279\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.750\nNow, in here what does this 2142 do.\n\n280\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.270\nSo, basically to get this screen I\nbooted my router to the control break.\n\n281\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.840\nRight what is this.\n\n282\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.930\nSo then I did a confreg 0x2142.\n\n283\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:33.910\nWhat does that do?\n\n284\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.650\nDoes that put me in that mini IOS or\nsomething?\n\n285\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.170\n>> It doesn't.\n\n286\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.000\nIt allows you to load the operating\nsystem without the startup config.\n\n287\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.515\n>> Yes, all right Ronnie go store I\nguess I'd be drinking on that one.\n\n288\n00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:47.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right like, good job.\n\n289\n00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:47.990\nDarn it!\n\n290\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.670\nWe should do that on our next episode.\n\n291\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.340\n>> We should try!\n\n292\n00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.290\n>> Get a bottle of tequila, and\n\n293\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.335\nwe'll see if we can get it to\nlast past like ten minutes.\n\n294\n00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:55.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways we're gonna do that, all right?\n\n295\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.910\nMaybe on Saturday episodes.\n\n296\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.532\n>> I don't think I'm\ngonna last ten minutes.\n\n297\n00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:00.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Wuss.\n\n298\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.240\nCome on.\n\n299\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.250\nAnyways, let's go here,\nconfreg 0x2142 that's exactly right.\n\n300\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.210\nAnd then notice I hit I for\ninitialize here.\n\n301\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.380\nWhy did I do this?\n\n302\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.440\nPassive recovery, passive recovery.\n\n303\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.880\nA new objectives, it wasn't on the\nobjectives before, on the objective today.\n\n304\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.950\nSo, you're gonna come in here\nboot ROM mon, Ctrl+Break, or\n\n305\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:28.470\nif it gets there because you have no\nIOS confreg 0x2142, i for initialize.\n\n306\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.530\nYou'll end up in setup mode.\n\n307\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.633\nSay no, Copy Start Run,\nyou're past your passwords,\n\n308\n00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:33.752\nnow you can change your passwords,\nyou're good to go.\n\n309\n00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:36.333\nThen change your configuration register\nback to, what's the default, guys?\n\n310\n00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:37.939\n>> 2102.\n\n311\n00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:41.148\n>> Yep, 0x2102.\n\n312\n00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:44.101\n2102.\n\n313\n00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:47.410\nAnd just really when you boot your router,\nand you see ROM on this is bad.\n\n314\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.360\nThis is bad.\n\n315\n00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.640\nAnd you're only gonna see\nthis on a Monday morning.\n\n316\n00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.720\n>> Or a Friday afternoon.\n\n317\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.565\n>> Or a Friday, yeah.\n\n318\n00:15:53.565 --> 00:15:55.861\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, you've tried to run out to these\n\n319\n00:15:55.861 --> 00:15:59.180\ntickets that you spent $500 on or\nsomething, boy.\n\n320\n00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.078\nThat's when you hit rom man.\n\n321\n00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:01.177\nAll right.\n\n322\n00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:04.629\nCopy run tftp.\n\n323\n00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:05.176\nWhat's that gonna do?\n\n324\n00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:07.030\nThat's gonna back up my running config.\n\n325\n00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.710\nThis is a good thing to do.\n\n326\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.821\nThere's probably a lot of ways to do, you\ncan do it on a, you don't have to do tftp.\n\n327\n00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:14.340\nYou can do a usb and\nyou can do all sorts of things like copy.\n\n328\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.229\nAnd remember,\nwe are gonna do a couple things.\n\n329\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.110\nWe're going to encrypt our passwords and\n\n330\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.493\nthen we're gonna make sure no one can get\nthem because if they're a type five or\n\n331\n00:16:23.493 --> 00:16:26.090\ntype seven,\nwe can easily break into those right.\n\n332\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:33.185\nSo copy tftp run is going to\nmerge this back, all right.\n\n333\n00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:36.381\nWhy don't we take a look at some\nof these before we get into that.\n\n334\n00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:40.361\nOkay, so let's go ahead and I'm gonna\nrun out to my switch and let's run\n\n335\n00:16:40.361 --> 00:16:44.621\nthrough some of the commands that I've\nbeen showing you guys already today.\n\n336\n00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:48.080\nI'll wait for my screen to come up here.\n\n337\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.350\nSo at this point here my THP\nserver is 10.100.126.126,\n\n338\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.530\nright so I just built it last night.\n\n339\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.920\nI just put it off one of my switches.\n\n340\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.830\nDoes it matter if I'm doing\nthis on a switch or a router?\n\n341\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.750\nSame commands fellas, same commands.\n\n342\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.580\nAll right let's take a look.\n\n343\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.320\nI'll get this as large as possible.\n\n344\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.090\nSo first thing,\nwell I have to do a show flash don't I?\n\n345\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.580\nWow see all those in there.\n\n346\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.230\nNow the one thing is hold on.\n\n347\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.240\nLet me see if I can get this over here.\n\n348\n00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.930\nIs I see my iOS here, but\nthere's my vlan.dat, right?\n\n349\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.550\nThat's in Flash.\n\n350\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.690\nWe're gonna come back to that tomorrow.\n\n351\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.900\nBut now I've gotta get over here and\nsee my iOS.\n\n352\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.400\nI can't really get it from here.\n\n353\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.170\nI can't see the whole thing, right?\n\n354\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.630\nIt's showing up over here on the side.\n\n355\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.280\nSo maybe a better way to get it, and\nsince I only have one iOS, right?\n\n356\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.327\nIs shown in here.\n\n357\n00:17:34.327 --> 00:17:36.366\nI'll just do a show version and\ncopy it from there, right?\n\n358\n00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:37.240\nHow does that sound?\n\n359\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.969\nThere it is right there,\nit says hey I loaded from flash,\n\n360\n00:17:41.969 --> 00:17:44.933\nthis is a 12-55 which is fine.\n\n361\n00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:51.156\nSay edit mark so\nI'm not gonna mark the word flash.\n\n362\n00:17:51.156 --> 00:17:54.275\nAll right, marking the word the iOS.\n\n363\n00:17:54.275 --> 00:17:55.633\nOkay, oops.\n\n364\n00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:00.883\nOkay.\n\n365\n00:18:04.672 --> 00:18:08.056\nNotice I copy that cuz I'm extremely lazy.\n\n366\n00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:12.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Copy flash tftp.\n\n367\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.707\nI'm gonna have to go back to\nour source file name, okay?\n\n368\n00:18:15.707 --> 00:18:21.000\nSo [COUGH] that's what I got for my flash.\n\n369\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.820\nRemote host was 10.100.126.126.\n\n370\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.550\nAnd notice now, I can change this.\n\n371\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.600\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave it the same.\n\n372\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.700\nNow, being that it's not\ngoing all that fast,\n\n373\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.940\nwe probably could do more lecture\nat this point, I'm thinking.\n\n374\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.820\nBecause this is not a small iOS.\n\n375\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.090\nDid we look at what size it was?\n\n376\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:46.520\nLet's go back up here and\nsee if I can see that in the show flash.\n\n377\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.140\nI don't think it's gonna allow me\nto because it's going like that.\n\n378\n00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.710\nSo I might have started a monster here.\n\n379\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.030\nAnd let's go ahead and\njump ahead while that is running\n\n380\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.730\nthen we'll come back in here so by,\nI'm backing up the iOS aren't I?\n\n381\n00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.023\nOr did it finished already.\n\n382\n00:19:02.023 --> 00:19:05.240\n1231, on it's only 12 banks.\n\n383\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.950\nOkay.\n\n384\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.845\nSo now so we can come in here\nI didn't know it was so small.\n\n385\n00:19:08.845 --> 00:19:11.800\n3560-ipservices, not enterprise, right?\n\n386\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.130\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's why.\n\n387\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.805\nSo, I don't like this switch very much.\n\n388\n00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can't do routing.\n\n389\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.780\nYou're useless to me!\n\n390\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.720\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n391\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.132\nCopied in 27 seconds,\nthat's pretty good actually.\n\n392\n00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:24.560\nGot our TFTP acknowledgements, right?\n\n393\n00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.777\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And our connection oriented application\n\n394\n00:19:26.777 --> 00:19:27.900\nthere, guys?\n\n395\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.000\nAll right, pretty good.\n\n396\n00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.570\nAnd we can easily put that back and\nI'm not going to though, copy tftp flash.\n\n397\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.350\nRight?\nBut wait.\n\n398\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.960\nI got more to show you.\n\n399\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.650\nWhat happens if I said,\nwell I copied that to a tftp server but\n\n400\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.950\nI don't want to do that.\n\n401\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.590\nI want to copy to an ftp server and scp.\n\n402\n00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.250\nWelcome to the new objectives.\n\n403\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.610\nAll right so\nI'm gonna do a question mark here.\n\n404\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:51.730\nAnd we're gonna come up here.\n\n405\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.040\nI'm gonna go back up here.\n\n406\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.176\nNow this verify objective.\n\n407\n00:19:55.176 --> 00:19:56.039\nThis is a season objective.\n\n408\n00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.088\nWhat does this verify do?\n\n409\n00:19:57.088 --> 00:19:58.080\nI'm gonna show you.\n\n410\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.580\nThis says verify image.\n\n411\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.360\nThis is gonna do an MD five check,\nan MD five check.\n\n412\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.030\nThat's what that verify is.\n\n413\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:09.901\nNotice that I can use flash, ftp, htp,\n\n414\n00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:13.779\nright, so I could say copy ftp.\n\n415\n00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:17.752\nI can copy s, now really what\nyou want to do is just a few,\n\n416\n00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:21.726\nyou could sure use tftp if\nit's a 32 megs or smaller but\n\n417\n00:20:21.726 --> 00:20:27.073\nyou get the IOS's, you probably want\nto do ftp or something [COUGH] and scp.\n\n418\n00:20:27.073 --> 00:20:29.520\nThese take a little bit more\neffort on the servers and so on.\n\n419\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.310\nThe reason people use tftp, it's easy,\nit's fast, it's clean and simple.\n\n420\n00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:39.690\nRight but with scp, secure copy protocol,\nand ftp, now we can do much larger files.\n\n421\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.321\nOkay.\nAnd then, how do I do an md five check?\n\n422\n00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:44.328\n>> /verify.\n\n423\n00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:49.329\n>> /verify at the end of the command.\n\n424\n00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:49.851\nOkay?\nSo\n\n425\n00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:55.310\nit doesn't matter which one you guys wanna\nuse, the fact is then we can take a look.\n\n426\n00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.857\nThere's all sorts of\ndifferent ones in here.\n\n427\n00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:00.486\nAnd notice it's saying hey,\nyou wanna do your tftp.\n\n428\n00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:02.113\nYou've got xmodem.\n\n429\n00:21:02.113 --> 00:21:03.386\nYou've done xmodem?\n\n430\n00:21:03.386 --> 00:21:06.110\nSo that's been around since forever.\n\n431\n00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.190\nWe can actually restore in iOS.\n\n432\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.020\nAnd there has been some switches.\n\n433\n00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.780\nThe only way to do them was xmodem.\n\n434\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.230\nAnd it would take me about,\nI don't know, six hours.\n\n435\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.507\nLost this iOS one time.\n\n436\n00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:16.710\nI was working in San Francisco.\n\n437\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.760\nIn the middle of the night.\n\n438\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.850\nIt took all night for\nme to get this iOS working.\n\n439\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.270\nI'm in there working all frickin night\nto get this enterprise switch up working\n\n440\n00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:27.720\nbecause the only way to get the iOS\nis through the console at 115k\n\n441\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.380\nusing an x modem.\n\n442\n00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:34.100\nAnyways, all right, so, we don't want\nto use ex moto if we can help it.\n\n443\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.990\nAll right, that was fun,\nbut let's do this.\n\n444\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.900\nHow about this, guys?\n\n445\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.160\nCopy run, and we'll just go ahead\nif you guys can still see this.\n\n446\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.070\nCopy run tftp.\n\n447\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:45.780\nThat'll work.\n\n448\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:51.880\nAddress, or name of remote\nhost was 10.100.126.126 Enter.\n\n449\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.620\nNow, check this out.\n\n450\n00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.930\nThis is extremely important here for\nyou to administrates functions.\n\n451\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.576\nWhere did they put the destination,\nbecause when I pressed enter here,\n\n452\n00:22:02.576 --> 00:22:04.982\nit just pushed it over there and\nthat's great.\n\n453\n00:22:04.982 --> 00:22:08.070\nI am like, it took the host name,\nended out in config.\n\n454\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.605\nGreat, I know what that is so\n\n455\n00:22:09.605 --> 00:22:13.310\nwhen I ever need it, I just type the host\nname dash config and get it back.\n\n456\n00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.280\nSo I'm just gonna say I need it back.\n\n457\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.950\nCopy TFTP to run, right?\n\n458\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.020\nSo it's gonna say well what's\nthe address or name of remote host?\n\n459\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.200\n10.100.126.125.\n\n460\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.410\nSource file name was SW1-config.\n\n461\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.530\nI'm all good to go, right?\n\n462\n00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.110\nSo here we go.\n\n463\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.980\nWe're gonna pull that.\n\n464\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.070\nWe're gonna merge it back in.\n\n465\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.552\nHe's gonna go what?\n\n466\n00:22:35.552 --> 00:22:36.542\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n467\n00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:38.910\nThere's no such file as that, right.\n\n468\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.210\nBecause that wasn't the file name.\n\n469\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.601\nIf you don't look closely\nlook at what it did to me.\n\n470\n00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:50.839\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I named it the host name, -confg.\n\n471\n00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:53.465\nAnd you don't even look at that,\nyou just press Enter.\n\n472\n00:22:53.465 --> 00:22:55.690\nAnd then say I wanna get it back,\nyour network's down.\n\n473\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.210\nAnd you're like, I gotta get my file back.\n\n474\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.180\nI know what it is, I just saved it.\n\n475\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.350\nAnd you can't get it back,\nyou're freaking out, right?\n\n476\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.204\nSo I mean,\nthat's never happened to me, but.\n\n477\n00:23:02.204 --> 00:23:04.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just like all the time.\n\n478\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.530\nSo you gotta remember that it's confg.\n\n479\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.100\nNow, you could easily\nchange that to begin with.\n\n480\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.150\nBut nonetheless,\njust pay attention to that.\n\n481\n00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.490\nAll right?\nThat was kind of fun, wasn't it?\n\n482\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.198\n>> Yes.\n\n483\n00:23:14.198 --> 00:23:16.436\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We backed up our OS,\n\n484\n00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:21.280\nwe backed up our config,\ntried to bring back the wrong file, right?\n\n485\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.370\nAnd don't forget, copy SCP, right?\n\n486\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:30.947\nOr, copy flash SCP,\ncopy flash FTP/ slash verify right?\n\n487\n00:23:30.947 --> 00:23:32.906\nOr 3MB5 check all right.\n\n488\n00:23:36.111 --> 00:23:36.893\nWhere am I?\n\n489\n00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:41.393\nAll right, for telephone network\n[LAUGH] which stands for,\n\n490\n00:23:41.393 --> 00:23:46.888\nwe just use the slang telnet today\ndon't we for like the last 40 years.\n\n491\n00:23:46.888 --> 00:23:50.174\nOkay, now we know that we can telnet\nfrom a host prompt, can't we?\n\n492\n00:23:50.174 --> 00:23:53.691\nWe just go to a command prompt,\nsay telnet the IP address, it's true.\n\n493\n00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:57.951\nNow notice from a router prompt,\nI can say telnet ip_address too.\n\n494\n00:23:57.951 --> 00:23:59.891\nThat seems like a lot of work, Ronnie.\n\n495\n00:23:59.891 --> 00:24:02.600\nI'm not into this much work of\ntyping out the full world telnet,\n\n496\n00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.766\ndo I really have to do that?\n\n497\n00:24:03.766 --> 00:24:06.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can't I just type in the IP address\n\n498\n00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.360\nand press Enter?\n\n499\n00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.305\nI can, that's a feature.\n\n500\n00:24:09.305 --> 00:24:10.817\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now it's an annoying feature.\n\n501\n00:24:10.817 --> 00:24:15.782\n[LAUGH] Now for you guys to remember,\nand I'm gonna show you this in a second,\n\n502\n00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:19.160\nwhen I typed in no IP domain lookup,\nall right?\n\n503\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.746\nI'm gonna come back to that in a second,\nremember,\n\n504\n00:24:20.746 --> 00:24:21.838\nthat was the first thing I typed in.\n\n505\n00:24:21.838 --> 00:24:24.330\nThere was a reason I typed that in first.\n\n506\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.693\nAll right, in this case here\ncheck out what I'm doing here.\n\n507\n00:24:26.693 --> 00:24:28.930\nI'm just typing the IP\naddress into a location.\n\n508\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.390\nLet's go back to my corp router,\nwhere's my corp router?\n\n509\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.420\nCome here, corp, corp?\n\n510\n00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.700\nLA, San Francisco,\ncorp's gotta be down here somewhere.\n\n511\n00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.319\nCome on Corp.\n\n512\n00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:46.311\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:47.700\n>> I'm getting there guys.\n\n514\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.110\nAll right, I should have moved him.\n\n515\n00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.220\nAll right, there he is.\n\n516\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.550\nHere's Corp router.\n\n517\n00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.350\nWhat's the password?\n\n518\n00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.570\nConsole.\n\n519\n00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.577\nWhat's that, Todd?\n>> Todd.\n\n520\n00:24:54.577 --> 00:24:58.993\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And.\n\n521\n00:24:58.993 --> 00:24:59.696\nIs it capital L?\n\n522\n00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:02.410\n>> Yes.\n\n523\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.310\nNice.\nThose are some great easy to remember\n\n524\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.980\npasswords, everyone should use those.\n\n525\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.170\nAll right, so what was I doing here?\n\n526\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.230\nNow I wanna telnet.\n\n527\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.850\nNow I don't wanna type in a lot of stuff\nbut I need to know the IP address, so\n\n528\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.640\nwe're gonna learn that\nin the next session,\n\n529\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.320\nhow do I get the IP address\nof my neighbor from here?\n\n530\n00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.641\nRight?\nSo I think I'm gonna remember that it's\n\n531\n00:25:23.641 --> 00:25:27.238\n172.16 dot, I'm 172.16.1.1,\n\n532\n00:25:27.238 --> 00:25:31.934\nso this guy would be probably\n1.2 I'm guessing is my neighbor.\n\n533\n00:25:31.934 --> 00:25:34.221\n[COUGH] sh ip int brief.\n\n534\n00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:40.485\n172, 10, yeah.\n\n535\n00:25:40.485 --> 00:25:41.437\nWhat did I type in, one?\n\n536\n00:25:41.437 --> 00:25:42.102\n>> I think so.\n\n537\n00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:49.883\n>> I'm one so .2, so\nremember I'm 10.1, 10.2.\n\n538\n00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:51.740\nMy gosh, my network's not working.\n\n539\n00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.001\nWell we're gonna have to troubleshoot this\nfirst before I can telnet out to that guy.\n\n540\n00:25:56.001 --> 00:25:57.250\nIt's definitely trying to telnet.\n\n541\n00:25:58.955 --> 00:26:00.269\nBoy, okay so he's up and\n\n542\n00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:03.911\nup, so let's start going through\nour verification commands here.\n\n543\n00:26:03.911 --> 00:26:06.200\nHe's definitely 10.1 is up and up.\n\n544\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.830\nWhat's the problem here?\n\n545\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:15.910\nAnd that's going to, and I brought\nup my [COUGH] 10.2 is San Francisco.\n\n546\n00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:16.707\nYeah I was right.\n\n547\n00:26:16.707 --> 00:26:18.231\n10.1 and 10.2.\n\n548\n00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:19.679\nAnd here's San Francisco.\n\n549\n00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:21.114\nSo let's see what's up with this guy.\n\n550\n00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:27.550\nWell that's not good.\n\n551\n00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.830\nSee if LA's working.\n\n552\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.310\nEh, screw him we'll just\ntell him we went to LA.\n\n553\n00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.750\nPoor San Francisco.\n\n554\n00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.250\nNo, okay.\n\n555\n00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.910\nSo he's 10 dot, we're 5, so\nhe would be 6 in the next subnet.\n\n556\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.317\nPassword required.\n\n557\n00:26:39.317 --> 00:26:40.217\nHow did that happen?\n\n558\n00:26:40.217 --> 00:26:41.289\nWhat does that mean?\n\n559\n00:26:41.289 --> 00:26:42.810\nI thought I set my passwords.\n\n560\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.280\n>> Maybe, not on LA.\n\n561\n00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.790\n>> I didn't and that was the thing.\n\n562\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.670\nRemember telnet does not work by default.\n\n563\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.130\nThat's a feature right?\n\n564\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.111\nSo, lets run out to LA.\n\n565\n00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:55.050\nI just lost my host out here.\n\n566\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.700\nThat's what happened to it.\n\n567\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.295\nOkay.\n\n568\n00:26:59.295 --> 00:27:01.999\nOkay and router 2 is.\n\n569\n00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:02.900\nI have to clear the line.\n\n570\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.820\nSo lets go to LA.\n\n571\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:10.080\nAnd guys, how do I set my password for\nmy Telnet on LA cuz I didn't do that.\n\n572\n00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.580\nSo, what do you think?\n\n573\n00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.780\nLine.\n\n574\n00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.007\n>> By line.\n>> You guys can't see that.\n\n575\n00:27:17.158 --> 00:27:22.882\nLine vty 0, space, question mark,\nnow notice that I didn't hit Enter.\n\n576\n00:27:22.882 --> 00:27:26.617\nAnd its gonna give me my last line number,\nI have 988 lines here.\n\n577\n00:27:26.617 --> 00:27:30.130\nI'm gonna set them all,\nokay, password telnet,\n\n578\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.752\nlogin even though I don't need that.\n\n579\n00:27:32.752 --> 00:27:35.673\nNow if I come back to the corp router,\nlets try this again.\n\n580\n00:27:43.465 --> 00:27:45.280\nAnd, there it is right there.\n\n581\n00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.720\nNow, what do you think's gonna happen?\n\n582\n00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.690\nI don't remember setting\nany other passwords.\n\n583\n00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.310\nHere I am in LA, so now I'm in there.\n\n584\n00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.790\nI should just be able to\nget into enable mode.\n\n585\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.840\nThis is so exciting.\n\n586\n00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.825\n>> Sure.\n>> Because no one has a password,\n\n587\n00:27:54.825 --> 00:27:55.584\nI'm gonna type in enable.\n\n588\n00:27:55.584 --> 00:27:58.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Man!\n\n589\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.623\nSo if you tell me they don't\nset the enable, it's like nope,\n\n590\n00:28:00.623 --> 00:28:01.536\ncan't do it from here.\n\n591\n00:28:01.536 --> 00:28:03.870\nSame thing happens with\nthe auxiliary port by the way.\n\n592\n00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:08.330\nSo at a minimum here for me to do any\nwork out there and I'm gonna show you, so\n\n593\n00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.410\nstick around here.\n\n594\n00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:10.400\nWhat do I need here?\n\n595\n00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.430\nEnable.\n\n596\n00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.430\n>> Secret?\n\n597\n00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.622\n>> Secret, what were we sending this to?\n\n598\n00:28:15.622 --> 00:28:19.463\nAll right so now I'll do.\n\n599\n00:28:19.463 --> 00:28:20.015\nBoom.\n\n600\n00:28:20.015 --> 00:28:21.460\nBadda bing badda boom.\n\n601\n00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.880\nNow, here we are.\n\n602\n00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.772\nI'm logged in.\n\n603\n00:28:23.772 --> 00:28:28.360\nThere's a couple commands before we go\nback, and we will head off in SSH land.\n\n604\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.390\nBut, before we do that,\nwe want to verify this.\n\n605\n00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.290\nI want to see, what's the command\nto verify whose telling it to me.\n\n606\n00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.660\nSo I'm a router, I'm like I wonder\nif anyone has broken into me, or\n\n607\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.520\ntelling it to me, or whats going on?\n\n608\n00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.990\nThat command is show line.\n\n609\n00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.050\nNow we have a lot of lines here,\nnot that I need to see them all.\n\n610\n00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:46.660\nAll right?\n\n611\n00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.570\nSo [COUGH].\n\n612\n00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:55.133\nShow line is gonna give me\nall of my lines here but\n\n613\n00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:59.400\nthe best command to use is show users.\n\n614\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.280\nAll right.\nSo, this isn't real fast.\n\n615\n00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.740\nHere this is a slow process.\n\n616\n00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.660\nSo, it's gonna take a second to come up,\nbut I you can see down here,\n\n617\n00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.520\nit's gonna pop up here in a second.\n\n618\n00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.387\nThat I'm in line 514.\n\n619\n00:29:11.387 --> 00:29:12.427\nWhy they're going 514?\n\n620\n00:29:12.427 --> 00:29:14.860\nDid I tell telnet 514?\n\n621\n00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.945\nIt felt good to the LA router.\n\n622\n00:29:16.945 --> 00:29:19.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like I like that line number.\n\n623\n00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.300\nAll right?\n\n624\n00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.230\nSo, now you can see why I\nset all of the line numbers.\n\n625\n00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:27.480\nIf I would have just said 0 through 4,\nit would have said connection refused.\n\n626\n00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.820\nSo, you set all your line numbers.\n\n627\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:35.000\nNow, I said, well I don't like\nthat router being in here.\n\n628\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.560\nSo, I will show you how to\nclear that out in a second, but\n\n629\n00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.510\nI don't want to clear it yet,\ncuz I wanna show you something else.\n\n630\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.000\nNow I'm in Corp router,\nI'm Telnetted out to LA.\n\n631\n00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.810\nI wanna come back.\n\n632\n00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.450\nI made my changes, whatever it was.\n\n633\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.190\nI turned on debugging.\n\n634\n00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.370\nWho knows what it was?\n\n635\n00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.060\nAnd I made some changes.\n\n636\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.650\nI wanna check them so what should I do?\n\n637\n00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.100\nI'm gonna do Ctrl+Shift+6, I go press x.\n\n638\n00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.950\nAnd I would be back in my Corp router but\nI forgot about my access server here.\n\n639\n00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.760\nAll right so, because I'm already\ntelnetted in, I kind of have a loop.\n\n640\n00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.620\nSo I telnetted into my access server\nthen reverse telnetted in here so\n\n641\n00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.890\nwhen I did that, it didn't take me back.\n\n642\n00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.832\nBut a control shift six X would have taken\nyou back to your originating router,\n\n643\n00:30:07.832 --> 00:30:11.055\nthe corp router in this example and\nthen you do a show session so,\n\n644\n00:30:11.055 --> 00:30:13.166\nI'm gonna go back here to show sessions.\n\n645\n00:30:20.272 --> 00:30:20.840\nLA.\n\n646\n00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.030\nAnd then this was my corp router,\nso router six.\n\n647\n00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.800\nSo when I do this on an access\nrouter guys, here's how you do this.\n\n648\n00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.661\nYou want to clear a line.\n\n649\n00:30:32.661 --> 00:30:34.532\nSo we're gonna use the Clear Line command.\n\n650\n00:30:37.772 --> 00:30:40.190\nAnd now I can get back into six again.\n\n651\n00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.613\nLet's see, return to previous menu.\n\n652\n00:30:42.613 --> 00:30:43.820\nAnd then number six.\n\n653\n00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.360\nAnd now I'm in LA, but\nI'm not really in LA, right?\n\n654\n00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.990\nBecause I've telenetted out there.\n\n655\n00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.840\nSo how do I get back?\n\n656\n00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.710\nWell, Ctrl+Shift+6+X is good, but\nwhen you're already telenetted into\n\n657\n00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.720\nan access server and reverse\nteleneting in, that's not gonna work.\n\n658\n00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.490\nSo in that case I would have\ndone a show sessions, but\n\n659\n00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:03.010\nhere I could just, I could clear the line,\nbut you can't clear,\n\n660\n00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:07.360\nwhat would we use, line show users,\nI forget what line we were.\n\n661\n00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.611\n514.\nSo now I can say clear line 514, right.\n\n662\n00:31:10.611 --> 00:31:11.850\nThat's who's into me.\n\n663\n00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.740\nBut it's probably not gonna let me\nbecause as the that's my default line.\n\n664\n00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.020\nSo if I was in here and\nit wasn't my Telnet session and\n\n665\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.820\nI did that, then it would allow me.\n\n666\n00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.270\nSo watch if I do this.\n\n667\n00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.310\nYeah, I'm not allowed to do that.\n\n668\n00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.860\nSo I'm just gonna, but\nI would do clear line to bring me back and\n\n669\n00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.050\nnow I'm in the corp.\n\n670\n00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.010\nNow the way that I would see\nthat I'm Telneted into something\n\n671\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.440\nwould be show sessions, right.\n\n672\n00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.600\nNow in this case here,\nI cleared that session, but\n\n673\n00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.120\nit would show my session to L.A..\n\n674\n00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.817\nSo if I had a control shift 6 x back\nthen I would just show sessions,\n\n675\n00:31:39.817 --> 00:31:41.370\npress the number one.\n\n676\n00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:42.860\nAnd you can have multiple sessions there.\n\n677\n00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.147\nAnd this is so\nhelpful if you have multiple links,\n\n678\n00:31:46.147 --> 00:31:48.349\nright, in to remote locations.\n\n679\n00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:52.197\nYou can open them all up, go out to them,\ncome back to your originating router and\n\n680\n00:31:52.197 --> 00:31:52.888\nthen go back.\n\n681\n00:31:52.888 --> 00:31:53.821\nVery, very useful commands.\n\n682\n00:31:53.821 --> 00:31:54.687\nRight.\n\n683\n00:31:54.687 --> 00:31:58.325\nWe're going to go ahead and\ndo some SSH now.\n\n684\n00:31:58.325 --> 00:32:04.646\nSo control shift x and show sessions, and\nthe show sessions will show me my sessions\n\n685\n00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:10.720\nthat who I'm connected to with Telnet here\nor SSH and show user shows which one.\n\n686\n00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.220\nIn this case, they were in line 11.\n\n687\n00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.190\nAlright?\n\n688\n00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:18.330\nNow the minimum commands for SSH here,\nlet's talk about these for a second.\n\n689\n00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.880\nThe first thing,\nthis is my local database.\n\n690\n00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.110\nNow, I'm going to use this for\na couple things.\n\n691\n00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.830\nBut first, I'm going to use it for\nlogging into a host coming in, and\n\n692\n00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.110\nlogging into me as an SSH server.\n\n693\n00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.120\nRight, if they're a client.\n\n694\n00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.830\nNow, they're a local database, so\nthey're going to authenticate here.\n\n695\n00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.610\nI can push them off to\nan authentication server,\n\n696\n00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.350\nbut that's not until next week in ICD2.\n\n697\n00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.690\nSo, we're going to use\nthe local database here.\n\n698\n00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.990\nUsername Todd, password Lammle.\n\n699\n00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.210\nNow you have to have a domain name so\ncheck this out.\n\n700\n00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.520\nThis domain name that you create.\n\n701\n00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.140\nYou use this, and\nthe host name of the router switch.\n\n702\n00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.980\nTo create your key, and\nthe way you crate your key is here.\n\n703\n00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.830\nSo before you create your key,\n\n704\n00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:04.240\nyou have to have set your hosting and\ncreated a domain name.\n\n705\n00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.080\nNow the domain name doesn't matter,\nif you don't have one just make it up.\n\n706\n00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.710\nIn this case, I just made it up.\n\n707\n00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:16.020\nBut kind of I'll show you shortly that we\ncan use this domain name for other things.\n\n708\n00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.350\nIn this case here,\nwe're gonna generate our key.\n\n709\n00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.270\nIt's gonna come back and ask us, we'll\ntake a look at this by 1224 and 2048 bits.\n\n710\n00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.770\nYou know be careful,\nbecause it's a lot of overhead.\n\n711\n00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.490\nSo typically sometimes I typically\nuse in the middle, right?\n\n712\n00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.990\nAnd that forces you is be careful,\nit forces you to a,\n\n713\n00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.020\nCisco routers run 1 .5 ssh, right?\n\n714\n00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.120\nAnd it forces it to go to 199 well\nSecure Shell and Putty uses 2.0 which\n\n715\n00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.160\nis why my next command is\nip ssh version 2, right?\n\n716\n00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.610\nI think you should always type that in.\n\n717\n00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.250\nChoose your first and last line number.\n\n718\n00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:55.100\nAgain, I think when we do this it is\ngoing to show up in line 322, but\n\n719\n00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.920\nhere is the key under your\nvty lines login local\n\n720\n00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.650\nsays goto the local database and\nprompt for a username and password.\n\n721\n00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.060\nRight or at least for password they have\nto put in a username when they login.\n\n722\n00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:11.960\nOkay so, in my SSH I have a username and\npassword in the local database.\n\n723\n00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.680\nNow, the next thing is,\ncheck this out, transport input.\n\n724\n00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.210\nSsh transport input ssh.\n\n725\n00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.700\nOkay?\nNow this is saying that my transport\n\n726\n00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.420\ninput by default is telnet.\n\n727\n00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.550\nNow I don't know if you noticed,\nbut in that new router that I got,\n\n728\n00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.730\nthat 15.2 one, the transport inputs\nhad all, and I said that's not good.\n\n729\n00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.180\nI've got to come back to that.\n\n730\n00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.000\nYou don't wanna do that.\n\n731\n00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.250\nI have that listed here as to not,\nto tell you not to do that.\n\n732\n00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.500\nAnd then I go out there and\nthat was the default on that router.\n\n733\n00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.880\nI was like, holy crap,\n\n734\n00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.160\nno you don't wanna do that because now you\ngot like r log in and stuff like that,\n\n735\n00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.420\nall these clear text stuff fingered,\njust crazy stuff that can get in there.\n\n736\n00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.610\nRight?\nSo you really wanna limit your transport.\n\n737\n00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.710\nBy default is telnet we're gonna, well for\n\n738\n00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.970\nthe most part most of the time we\nwanna change that to SSH, right?\n\n739\n00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.700\nNow if you want to use SSH and\ntelnet, that's fine too.\n\n740\n00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.930\nCuz there's times that sometimes\nI just want telnet easy peasy.\n\n741\n00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.450\nTransport input SSH telnet,\nthat command will work too.\n\n742\n00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.865\nLet's go ahead and try this, didn't get\nmy last telnet one going very well.\n\n743\n00:35:10.865 --> 00:35:13.800\n[LAUGH] I forgot about my access server.\n\n744\n00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.910\nAll right, so here we got my corp router.\n\n745\n00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.300\nLet's go out to the LA router.\n\n746\n00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.760\nHere I'm in the LA router.\n\n747\n00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.480\nNo I'm gonna put it on the corp,\nand then we'll go log in with SSH.\n\n748\n00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.550\nSo on the corp router here,\nwhat are the commands?\n\n749\n00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.400\nConfig t.\nWell the first thing I'm gonna do is some\n\n750\n00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.970\nusername, Todd.\n\n751\n00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.320\nA password.\n\n752\n00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.500\nAnd I can type in a level here,\na privilege level like 15, and\n\n753\n00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.440\nthat automatically would put\nme into privilege level.\n\n754\n00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.120\nSo I think if I press Enter it'd tell me,\nthis is the encrypted, hold on.\n\n755\n00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.630\nSo then I'm gonna say Lammle.\n\n756\n00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.112\nI think it was before that.\n\n757\n00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:54.577\n[COUGH] Yeah, there it is right there,\nTodd privilege.\n\n758\n00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:03.000\n15 password Lammle.\n\n759\n00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.340\nSo now, when I log in,\nI automatically get into privileged mode.\n\n760\n00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.930\nBe careful with that one, guys, right?\n\n761\n00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.230\nSo when I'm not going into user mode,\nnow, I'm going into privileged mode.\n\n762\n00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.930\nMay or may not wanna do that.\n\n763\n00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.930\nRemember, I have service\npassword encryption on.\n\n764\n00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.230\nThis is automatically encrypted, okay?\n\n765\n00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.700\nSo [COUGH] I have my username.\n\n766\n00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.350\nNow, what else do I need to do next?\n\n767\n00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.340\nI need to set my domain name.\n\n768\n00:36:27.036 --> 00:36:29.630\nOkay.\nLammle.com.\n\n769\n00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:33.370\nAnd now that I have that in my host name,\nI can generate my key.\n\n770\n00:36:44.692 --> 00:36:47.280\nIt's going to come back.\n\n771\n00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.780\nHow man bits do you want, 512, 1024?\n\n772\n00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.470\nIt says choose the size of\nthe key from 360 to 496.\n\n773\n00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.430\nI'm going to go to 1024.\n\n774\n00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.386\nAll right, that's typically what\nwe use today or you can use 512.\n\n775\n00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.050\nSometimes, there's some software\nprograms that don't take the 512.\n\n776\n00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.160\nI think that's why it ended up at 1,024.\n\n777\n00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.040\nAll right, now, hold on a second.\n\n778\n00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.040\nCheck out what I told,\nwhat I was telling you was gonna happen.\n\n779\n00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.240\nThey run 1.5 by default,\nthey, now they went to 1.99.\n\n780\n00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.040\nThat's not gonna help you.\n\n781\n00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.250\nYou're gonna go to Secure CRT and\ntry to log in,\n\n782\n00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:22.480\nit's just gonna,\ndenied you're not going to know why right?\n\n783\n00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.690\nSo we're going to type\nin ip ssh version 2.\n\n784\n00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.690\nOops, did I spell that wrong?\n\n785\n00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.590\n>> Version yep.\n\n786\n00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.160\n>> Okay, now I've got my ssh configured.\n\n787\n00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.940\nI need to tell my lines\nthat I'm going to use it.\n\n788\n00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:43.929\nSo line vty 0 space question mark, and\nI can't see my last line number, 988.\n\n789\n00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.830\nOkay, and then I'm gonna say login local.\n\n790\n00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.680\nI had login,\n\n791\n00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.500\nbut now even if I use telnet it's\ngonna use that user name and password.\n\n792\n00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.470\nWhat I like about it,\n\n793\n00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.650\nis it's gonna put me into privilege\nmode because of the way I set it up.\n\n794\n00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.830\nIt's good to be the Admin.\n\n795\n00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:01.287\n>> It is.\n[LAUGH]\n\n796\n00:38:01.287 --> 00:38:03.190\n>> Transferred input.\n\n797\n00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.150\nNow check this out.\n\n798\n00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:10.020\nLook at all this stuff, at rlogin,\npad,mop, lapb-ta, and so all, right.\n\n799\n00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.640\nThey have that all.\n\n800\n00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.430\nThat was kind, I don't know how they ended\nup saying that wasn't the full time here.\n\n801\n00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.390\nBut, in this case here, I'm gonna say SSH.\n\n802\n00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.170\nNow, the only thing that\ncan come in Is SSH.\n\n803\n00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.820\nNow remember I could say,\ntransport import SSH,\n\n804\n00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.650\nand it still let me put in another one and\nanother one and another one.\n\n805\n00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.550\nRight?\nIn this case here.\n\n806\n00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:35.270\nSo let's go now to LA cuz\nLA is working for me, and\n\n807\n00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:40.790\nI wanna SSH to, so we're gonna finish this\nup, this session right here, just hang in.\n\n808\n00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.690\nSSH, it's minus L, that looks like a one.\n\n809\n00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:44.930\nSo be careful there.\n\n810\n00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.110\nAnd by the way,\nI don't use this client very much,\n\n811\n00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.410\nbecause Cisco doesn't have\na very nice client, right?\n\n812\n00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.395\nSo that's why we're using secure or\nsomething like that.\n\n813\n00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:56.300\nSSH-L172.1610.1, actually\nthis guy's coming in on 5.\n\n814\n00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.960\nI guess it wouldn't matter, and then.\n\n815\n00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.160\n>> Do we need a username?\n\n816\n00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.810\n>> I do.\n\n817\n00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.200\nI was just testing.\n\n818\n00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.943\nSee if you're paying attention.\n\n819\n00:39:07.943 --> 00:39:08.611\n>> Okay.\n\n820\n00:39:08.611 --> 00:39:11.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> Todd, and then, once172.16.10.5.\n\n821\n00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.170\nNow, remember I can use a host name.\n\n822\n00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.250\nSo, stick around.\n\n823\n00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.170\nAfter this I'll be able to come back and\nmy password was what?\n\n824\n00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.380\nTell me?\n\n825\n00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.320\n>> No, lamley.\n\n826\n00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.800\n>> Lamley.\n[LAUGH] Woo hoo,\n\n827\n00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.695\nI've been covered by SSHN baby.\n\n828\n00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.520\n[LAUGH] Now let's go back to corp.\n\n829\n00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.680\nHere's a good way to finish.\n\n830\n00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.580\nNow let's go back to corp.\n\n831\n00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.490\nI am SSHN to this baby.\n\n832\n00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.340\nAll right, so now show what?\n\n833\n00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.410\nUsers.\n\n834\n00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.130\nShow users.\n\n835\n00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.370\nLet's see who's in me.\n\n836\n00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.240\nFive fourteen.\n\n837\n00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.640\nHe came in on five fourteen on this one.\n\n838\n00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.190\nTen dot six.\n\n839\n00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:44.380\nI usually don't see it, i see it in the\n322, but it came in in SSH, there it is.\n\n840\n00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.530\nUser Todd.\n\n841\n00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.520\nNow, I don't like Todd in here.\n\n842\n00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:49.900\nClear.\n\n843\n00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.470\nLine.\n\n844\n00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:54.320\n514.\nBadda Ping, badda boom.\n\n845\n00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.180\nPoor Todd.\n\n846\n00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.830\nBye bye.\n\n847\n00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.460\nAlright guys, we will be back.\n\n848\n00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.340\nWe're gonna come back, and\n\n849\n00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.030\nwe're gonna do how do I type that in with\na user name instead of an ip address.\n\n850\n00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.600\nI'm tired of using ip addresses.\n\n851\n00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.630\nI get confused.\n\n852\n00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.220\nLet's use user names.\n\n853\n00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.180\n>> All right, so in this episode remember\nwhat we actually saw here right?\n\n854\n00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.650\nIs that we took a look at\nthe idea of backing up\n\n855\n00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.560\ndifferent files in\ndifferent locations right?\n\n856\n00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.670\nEither using tftp, sep, ftp, you name it.\n\n857\n00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.190\nThere are several different\nways that we can do that.\n\n858\n00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.920\nMake sure you understand those commands,\nand\n\n859\n00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.710\nhow to get that there as well\nas understanding of course.\n\n860\n00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.510\nThe proper typing in of those\nnames is gonna help you out, so\n\n861\n00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.450\nbeing able to copy all that is\nreally gonna help us out too.\n\n862\n00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:38.170\nAlso Todd showed us at least\nthe beginnings and the very basics,\n\n863\n00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:42.640\nright, of how do we gain access to\neither that router or that switch using\n\n864\n00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.380\neither TelNet Or even SSH, and of course\nSSH is gonna be prefered today too.\n\n865\n00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.490\nBut we do have a lot more to go, so\nwe do want you to stay tuned with us.\n\n866\n00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.790\nSigning off for IT PROTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n867\n00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:55.590\n>> Todd Lanley.\n\n868\n00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.566\n>> Stay tuned for more CCENT content.\n\n869\n00:40:57.566 --> 00:40:58.686\n>> Okay.\n\n870\n00:40:58.686 --> 00:41:06.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Configuring both CDP and LLDP, he explains the differences and similarities between them.  DNS and DHCP are two networking topics that are important and every candidate should be able to configure both on the cisco routers.  Remember that if your dhcp server resides on a different network than the DHCP clients an IP helper address must configured on the router interface facing the clients.",

00:00:16.442\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:21.078\nAnd today we're continuing on with some\nICND1, getting ready for that new exam and\n\n5\n00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:25.280\nwho better to help us than, in our\nstudios today, we have Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n6\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.960\nTodd, thank you for\njoining us in our studios again.\n\n7\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.790\n>> Thank you, Ronnie,\nit's good to be back here.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.730\nAnd we're gonna start off by looking\nat CDP, Cisco Discovery Protocol, and\n\n9\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.420\nLink Layer Discovery Protocol,\na new objective.\n\n10\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.360\nAlthough they had it in the last one, they\nnever really pushed it, so we're gonna\n\n11\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.260\nlook at it a little bit more in depth and\npush in a lot more in the curriculum.\n\n12\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.490\nSo Cisco Discovery Protocol should\ntell you something right away.\n\n13\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.220\nCisco proprietary, right?\n\n14\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.660\nSo it's only tells me about Cisco\ndirectly connected devices.\n\n15\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.410\nLet's take a look,\ndeep dive into the objectives, all right?\n\n16\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.192\nFirst off, it's Cisco Proprietary,\nCisco Discovery Protocol,\n\n17\n00:00:57.192 --> 00:01:00.653\nwhich is why we can use\nLink Layer Discovery Protocol as well.\n\n18\n00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:03.820\nAnd again, we'll get into that, and\nwe're gonna configure both of these.\n\n19\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.790\nGathers information about\nCisco neighbor devices only,\n\n20\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.290\nand only if they are directly connected.\n\n21\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.770\nSo, if I look at this guy here,\nhe's whoops,\n\n22\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.720\nhe's consoled into this switch here.\n\n23\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.110\nAnd I'm gonna say, show CDP neighbors,\nas we'll take a look at.\n\n24\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.020\nI can only see who I'm\ndirectly connected to.\n\n25\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.960\nThere might be 100 switches off this guy,\nI can't see them.\n\n26\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.670\nI'd have to Telnet into this guy,\nand now look at them.\n\n27\n00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.720\nWhich makes this a true layer\ntwo protocol, doesn't it?\n\n28\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.730\nNow, it's turned on by default on\nall interfaces, on all devices, and\n\n29\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.730\nso this is a great troubleshooting tool.\n\n30\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.500\nI'm telling you, I use it every day.\n\n31\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.750\nIt is a phenomenal tool,\n\n32\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.200\nbecause it's gonna tell me about\nmy data link, me and my neighbor.\n\n33\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.160\nBecause most troubleshooting opportunities\nare about me and my neighbor, me and\n\n34\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.900\nmy neighbor, especially when\nyou get into routing stuff, so\n\n35\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.330\nwe want to find out, information about\nmy neighbors, this is going to do it.\n\n36\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.780\nNow one of the things that CDP can do,\nand LLDP can even do this better, but\n\n37\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.352\ncan be used to determine what type of VoIP\nphone, it's kind of hard to say isn't it?\n\n38\n00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:02.702\n>> It is.\n>> VoIP phone, that we're connected to.\n\n39\n00:02:02.702 --> 00:02:04.985\nAll right, it's going to tell\nus the different type of VoIP.\n\n40\n00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:07.628\nOkay, so, let's take a look,\nthe show commands, and\n\n41\n00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.627\nwe're going to run out to my switch\nhere and take a look at this.\n\n42\n00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:15.091\nBut show cdp is gonna show me my timers,\nso we're gonna do this and compare and\n\n43\n00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.440\ncontrast to the LLDP timers and\nsee that they're different.\n\n44\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.430\nShow cdp neighbors is going to\ngive me lots of great information\n\n45\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.170\nabout my neighbors' host names, my\ninterfaces, what type of device they are.\n\n46\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.140\nAnd then I can go further, show cdp\nneighbors detail and find out information\n\n47\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.660\nabout their IP addresses, and their\niOS version, that's some great stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.660\nCan you draw out a whole networking thing,\nusing CDP?\n\n49\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.130\n>> Yes you can,\nas long as they're all Cisco devices.\n\n50\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.146\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If they're not Cisco devices,\n\n51\n00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:44.817\nthen we're in trouble.\n\n52\n00:02:44.817 --> 00:02:45.772\n>> Yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:48.664\nSo, I don't think I've ever been anywhere\nin the world where there's not just all\n\n54\n00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:49.250\nCisco devices.\n\n55\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.790\nDoes that even exist?\n\n56\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.980\nI thought, Cisco runs this world.\n\n57\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.127\nStarbucks and Cisco yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:58.344\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways, [LAUGH] so\n\n59\n00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:03.100\nwe care about what we can\nget from our neighbors.\n\n60\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.269\nNow I've gone into many many customers and\nCDP has saved their lives because,\n\n61\n00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.341\nmany times the network managers\nthey get fired or they quit and\n\n62\n00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:14.706\nthey are disgruntled or whatever.\n\n63\n00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.205\nThey accidentally shred\nall the network documents.\n\n64\n00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:18.644\n[LAUGH] I've seen that.\n\n65\n00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:19.293\n>> Accidentally.\n\n66\n00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:21.244\n>> Accidentally happen many times.\n\n67\n00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:23.520\n[LAUGH] I've made a lot of money\nbecause of these accidents.\n\n68\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.230\nAnyways I go out there and\nCDP is my friend, right?\n\n69\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.110\nI just sit there, it takes a long time, so\n\n70\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.890\nyou're making a lot of money,\ndrawing out this entire network.\n\n71\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.320\nBut you can do it,\nthat's just what's so great about it.\n\n72\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.757\nSo this show cdp entry * same command\nas show cdp neighbors detail.\n\n73\n00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:39.591\nIt was actually the command we\nhad before the detail command, so\n\n74\n00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:41.670\nthey just kinda added this.\n\n75\n00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.790\nAnd the entry command's kinda cool,\nthough.\n\n76\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.540\nIt does give us a couple other parameters.\n\n77\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.860\nSo, I can do protocols here, and\njust get the neighbor's IP address.\n\n78\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.687\nSo, this is the one that I actually use\nthe most, show cdp entry * protocol,\n\n79\n00:03:55.687 --> 00:03:58.900\nbecause I get the host name and\nI get the IP address.\n\n80\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.420\nMost of the time,\nthat's all I care about right away.\n\n81\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.970\nIf I'm troubleshooting, and\nI need to get something fast.\n\n82\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.810\nI don't care about what\ninterface I'm connected to,\n\n83\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.440\nI just want to get in now, right.\n\n84\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.200\nThat's going to help,\nsh cdp entry * protocol.\n\n85\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.500\n>> Now, Todd, you mentioned\nthat it gives you IP address,\n\n86\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.870\ndidn't you say that this\nonly worked at layer two?\n\n87\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.120\n>> Yeah it does, but\nit's going to tell you the IP address,\n\n88\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.770\nbut you're not gonna be able to\nthen you'll have to use layer three\n\n89\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.350\ndevices like telnet or\nping to be able to do something with it.\n\n90\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.730\nSo it's just given us the statistics,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.830\nSo, the interface and\n\n92\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.990\ntraffic here, I don't really use\nthese a lot when troubleshooting, but\n\n93\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.100\nit tells me which interfaces are enabled\nwith CDP, and how much traffic, who cares.\n\n94\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.660\nAnyways, from Global Config, so\nI'm gonna do config t here, And cdp run.\n\n95\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.950\nNow a lot of times on a customer we do,\ncdp run is enabled by default.\n\n96\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.760\nAfter you draw out the network,\nyou can do a no cdp run,\n\n97\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.800\nwhich disables it on the box, right?\n\n98\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000\nSo why would you want to do that?\n\n99\n00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.420\nBecause I don't even have to be in\nprivilege mode to draw out your network,\n\n100\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.650\nI can do all this from user mode, right?\n\n101\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.380\nSo, that's why,\n\n102\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.330\nso some people consider it a security\nrisk but to me the troubleshooting\n\n103\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.940\nvalue that it gives you overrides\nall of the security problems.\n\n104\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.240\nBut you can still turn it off.\n\n105\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.130\nIf you want to turn it off on an interface\nthen we go into that interface.\n\n106\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.070\nSay, if we had a device\nconnected to the Internet or\n\n107\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.360\nsomething like that then we could\nstop it here with the no CDP enable.\n\n108\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.860\nLet's go ahead and take a look, wrong way.\n\n109\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.760\nLet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n110\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.060\nLet me go out to a switch here.\n\n111\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.960\nNotice I'm at user mode and\nI'm gonna make this bigger.\n\n112\n00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.730\nShow cdp, let's just do show cdp,\nand we'll see our timers.\n\n113\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.420\nSo, we're sending out every interface.\n\n114\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.320\nThis switch has what, 48 ports, I think.\n\n115\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.330\nAnd sending CDP out every port,\nevery 60 seconds.\n\n116\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.130\nNow, if I receive something,\nI'm gonna build a table, and\n\n117\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.190\nI'm gonna build this table,\nshow cdp neighbor.\n\n118\n00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.620\nI guess I'll hit Tab so\nyou guys see the whole command.\n\n119\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.740\nAnd now we can see who we're\ndirectly connected to.\n\n120\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.430\nI'm connected to my SF router\nhere off of Fas Ethernet 0/2.\n\n121\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.860\nThese are my local,\nthese are my interfaces.\n\n122\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.200\nNow down here at the very end on the right\nis my neighbor's interface that I'm\n\n123\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.780\nconnected to.\n\n124\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.180\nSo this is some good information.\n\n125\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.700\nSo I'm down here I'm drawing this out,\nI've got a switch.\n\n126\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.714\nI type in write out f02\nconnected to SF and\n\n127\n00:06:10.714 --> 00:06:15.990\nthen we come over here to capability\nover here and see that it's a router and\n\n128\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.969\nso we make a little router and\nit's a 2811 even tells us what it is.\n\n129\n00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.402\nAnd that we're connected\nto their Fas Ethernet 0/0.\n\n130\n00:06:23.402 --> 00:06:26.161\nThis is some awesome great information\nthat we can really use for\n\n131\n00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:27.039\ntroubleshooting.\n\n132\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.180\n>> Now Todd, this reminds me of something.\n\n133\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.310\nNormally, I see those memes that come out,\nand they show one guy lost behind a wall\n\n134\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.200\nof wires that are connected\nto multiple devices.\n\n135\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.950\nWhat you're showing me, right here, looks\nlike it would help me to be able to kinda\n\n136\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.950\ntrace down that kind of\nmessy wall of wires.\n\n137\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.790\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI suppose that it would be.\n\n138\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.950\nYou could do it that way.\n\n139\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.720\nAs a matter of fact, when I built the pods\nfor this I just connected everything up\n\n140\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.460\nand then just used CDP to\nsee what I was connected to.\n\n141\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.910\nI was kind of in a hurry so I'm like,\nI think these are all right.\n\n142\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.740\nCDP was what helped me make\nsure that everything was right.\n\n143\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.280\nTrue story there.\n\n144\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.710\nWe also though, I see the San Fransisco\nrouter here, says switch 1.\n\n145\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.670\nAnd, I know my F 0/2, Router,\nit's got a switch card in it,\n\n146\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.460\nthat's why we see the S and\nthe IGMP, and then their port.\n\n147\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.770\nRight, now, hold on, as I'm drawing this\nout, how can I get their IP address?\n\n148\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.880\nCuz I want to be able to Telnet into them,\nand see what's connected to them.\n\n149\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.022\nSo what am I gonna type in here Ronnie?\n\n150\n00:07:26.022 --> 00:07:28.545\n>> The show cdp neighbors detail.\n\n151\n00:07:28.545 --> 00:07:32.974\n>> Yeah, well let do show cdp entry *,\nsame command right.\n\n152\n00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:35.373\n>> Okay.\n>> Really no difference doing this command\n\n153\n00:07:35.373 --> 00:07:38.621\nand shows cdp neighbors detail,\nbut I'm doing this for a reason,\n\n154\n00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:40.539\nnotice I'm still in user mode, guys.\n\n155\n00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:43.250\nLet me come down here.\n\n156\n00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.370\nSo I can see here's SF,\nhere's my IP address and\n\n157\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.610\nnot only that I can get\ntheir iOS version as well.\n\n158\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.560\nThey're running 15.1 in advanced\nenterprise, awesome, right?\n\n159\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.956\nThis is some great information.\n\n160\n00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:57.007\nNow one of the things like I said,\n\n161\n00:07:57.007 --> 00:08:01.474\nif I was in a hurry this is what else I\nwas connected to, if I was in a hurry,\n\n162\n00:08:01.474 --> 00:08:05.359\nthen I'd do a question mark here and\nsee version and protocol So\n\n163\n00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:09.760\nI can do p for protocol and\nnow I just get a host name and IP address.\n\n164\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.270\nThat's nice.\n\n165\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.240\nThis is the one I use a lot when\nI'm in a hurry to troubleshoot and\n\n166\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.350\nget into a device.\n\n167\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.110\nThe other one I can do is v for\n\n168\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.460\nversion and\nthey'll just give me their iOS versions.\n\n169\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.150\nVery very cool stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.330\nOkay let's run back over to here.\n\n171\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.110\nMake that smaller,\nget that off the screen.\n\n172\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.755\nOkay, show cdp neighbors again.\n\n173\n00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:30.160\n[COUGH] Only shows my\ndirectly connected neighbors.\n\n174\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.970\nThe Local Interface is me.\n\n175\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.400\nThe Port ID is my neighbor's interface,\nand the device.\n\n176\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.060\nNow, the neighbor's detail, again,\nshows us our IP address, which is nice.\n\n177\n00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.960\nBut we also see the, now,\nwe get the same information\n\n178\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.050\nhere as the show cdp neighbors,\nplus the IP address and version.\n\n179\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.990\nThat's true.\n\n180\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.940\nHowever it's not as easy as to read.\n\n181\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.250\nI don't like it as much as a layout\nas the show cdp neighbors.\n\n182\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.000\nSo whichever one that you prefer,\nit's the same information.\n\n183\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.910\nNow we've got the CDP,\nwe're gonna get to LLDP in a second.\n\n184\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.520\nWant to talk about host names.\n\n185\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:09.270\nWe can build a local host name to\nresolve a host name to an IP address.\n\n186\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.810\nAnd typically we use DNS,\nbut we can build a local.\n\n187\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.530\nIf you have a small network,\nyou can do this.\n\n188\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.490\nI recommend the DNS Server if\nyou have quite a few devices.\n\n189\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.690\nBut instead of saying ping 172.16.10.2,\nI can just say ping SF, right, ping SF.\n\n190\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.424\nThat makes me much happier.\n\n191\n00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:30.595\nConfig t > IP host > the host name.\n\n192\n00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:34.380\nNow I can do this, on this router\nI have multiple IP addresses.\n\n193\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.240\nAnd so, I can ping and resolve it\nto any IP address on that router.\n\n194\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.410\nSo, my other IP address was this.\n\n195\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.067\nThis looks funny, 10.1.\n\n196\n00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:54.324\nSo I'd say ip host SF 172.16.10.1\n192.168.10.1 because, or this is 10.2.\n\n197\n00:09:54.324 --> 00:09:57.619\n[COUGH] Then it'll try the first one and\nthen the second one.\n\n198\n00:09:57.619 --> 00:09:58.602\nSo you can do it like that.\n\n199\n00:09:58.602 --> 00:10:01.160\nAnd then we could do show\nhosts to see my host table.\n\n200\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.450\nNow, this shows me if I had resolved\neven DNS, remember, we cache it.\n\n201\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.140\nSo how do I do a DNS server?\n\n202\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.530\nI'm gonna come down here and\ndo the IP domain lookup.\n\n203\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.390\nRemember, one of the things that\nI did when I first went into my\n\n204\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.220\nrouter was the know IP domain lookup.\n\n205\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.870\nBecause if you go and type something and\nyou make a mistake, it's rather annoying,\n\n206\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.930\nI think most of you guys have seen this.\n\n207\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.220\nSo if I come over here and\n\n208\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:29.040\ntype a command that's not\nreally a command, we get this.\n\n209\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.410\nIt's trying to help us here.\n\n210\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.290\nActually I know it's hard to believe\nthis but it's trying to do you a favor.\n\n211\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.140\nIt's saying hey that's not a command,\nthat's got to be a host name.\n\n212\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.950\nLet me resolve that for you and\nthen telling that to you.\n\n213\n00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.130\nThat's a feature right.\n\n214\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.720\nSo that's a pretty annoying\nfeature that when you\n\n215\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.500\nare in a hurry because that's\nwhen you screw up the most right.\n\n216\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:55.500\nSo we can fix that by saying no IP domain\nlook up that's why I have this here.\n\n217\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.440\nSo, config t no ip domain lookup.\n\n218\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.310\nIt's really one of the first commands\nI type in if I don't have a DNS\n\n219\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.440\nconfigure because that's really.\n\n220\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.440\nAnd you can't really break out of that,\nright.\n\n221\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.330\nSo, sometimes it could\ntake quite a few minutes.\n\n222\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.490\nSo, now if I get a DNS server and I'm\nsaying I'm gonna build, put A records in\n\n223\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:16.170\nthere and say, tell mid SF or SSH,\nnames, which is what we're gonna do.\n\n224\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.590\nI'm gonna go out there and\ncreate A records or quad-A records for\n\n225\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.970\nmy v6 on my server.\n\n226\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.261\nSo, create my IP domain-lookup.\n\n227\n00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:26.610\nName-server, I can list up to six of them.\n\n228\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.490\nAnd then this is my fully\nqualified domain name,\n\n229\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.960\nnotice the same one we used in\nthe last section on SSH, right so\n\n230\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.350\nwhen I'm doing SSH this might already\nbe done, I don't have to do it.\n\n231\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.605\nRemember just to recap,\nwe use the fully qualified domain\n\n232\n00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:43.035\nhere plus the host name to\ngenerate your key with SSH.\n\n233\n00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.535\nThat's why we need that.\n\n234\n00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:46.935\nAnyways, so I have this here.\n\n235\n00:11:46.935 --> 00:11:49.505\nAnd then once I create the records,\nlet's go out and do this,\n\n236\n00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:52.055\nbuild a local host table.\n\n237\n00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:54.309\nSo let me go to my corp router here.\n\n238\n00:11:56.553 --> 00:11:59.630\nAnd we'll put in San Francisco, okay?\n\n239\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.390\nSo, I'm gonna say sh ho, okay,\nwe don't have anything in there.\n\n240\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.430\nIf I was using DNS,\nit would be cached here.\n\n241\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.230\nNow, remember, if you are doing this,\nand you're gonna be a local host table,\n\n242\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.930\nyou'll wanna turn off the domain lookup.\n\n243\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.300\nI won't turn it off right now,\nso I'll show you why.\n\n244\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:21.771\nSo I'm gonna say config T IP host SF and\nthen 17216.10.2 all right.\n\n245\n00:12:21.771 --> 00:12:22.563\nHopefully I did that right.\n\n246\n00:12:22.563 --> 00:12:23.590\nWe'll find out.\n\n247\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.700\nNow I can do a do show ho and\nsee that it's in there or\n\n248\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.910\nit's permanent where it would say\ntemporary and then there's my IP address.\n\n249\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.580\nSo I should be able to do ping sf.\n\n250\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.910\nBoom.\n\n251\n00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.610\nRight, I like that very much, right.\n\n252\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.340\nAnd I already have the domain lookup off.\n\n253\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.221\nIf not, it would try, actually if I did\na ping SF, it would actually try to go\n\n254\n00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.769\nout and resolve it to a DNS\nserver then come back and\n\n255\n00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:51.012\ndo this, so that's a rather\nannoying feature, it really is.\n\n256\n00:12:51.012 --> 00:12:54.618\n[LAUGH] So if you're not have a DNS server\nwe're going to turn that off, okay?\n\n257\n00:12:54.618 --> 00:12:55.794\nNot a big objective here but\n\n258\n00:12:55.794 --> 00:12:58.416\nthis is kind of more helpful\nthan an objective at this point.\n\n259\n00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:04.672\nAll right now, big objective here LLDP,\n\n260\n00:13:04.672 --> 00:13:09.200\ncreated new standard CDP non proprietary.\n\n261\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.300\nIt has a following\nconfiguration guidelines and\n\n262\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.970\nlimitations you're going to remember for\nyour objective.\n\n263\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.890\nLLDP must be enabled on the device\nbefore you can enable or\n\n264\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.770\ndisable it on any interface, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.270\nSo, like CDP, it's not, unlike CDP,\nit's not enabled by default.\n\n266\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.320\nSo, we're gonna say LLDP run.\n\n267\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.910\nSame command, right, but with LLDP.\n\n268\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.120\nSo, if I go out and do that, and\n\n269\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.320\nthen I can disable it on the interface\njust like we can with CDP.\n\n270\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.020\nSo it must be,\n\n271\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.380\nit's supported only on physical interfaces\nwe can't use it with our sub interfaces.\n\n272\n00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.894\nIt can discover only one device\nper port and one of the things for\n\n273\n00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:51.820\nthe objectives you wanna remember is these\nright here, it can discover Linux servers.\n\n274\n00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.980\nWe can't do that with CDP.\n\n275\n00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.540\nSo there's some advantage here.\n\n276\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.490\nTo configure it,\nit's relatively simple like CDP,\n\n277\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.770\nnot a lot to it and we basically\nhave the same verification commands.\n\n278\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.560\nSo I'm just going to go out and\nturn it on, lldp run and\n\n279\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.320\nthen check this out though.\n\n280\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.610\nTo change it on interface,\nyou're going to probably remember this for\n\n281\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.400\nyour objectives,\nyou do it as a receive or transmit.\n\n282\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.740\nSo in this case here if I wanted\nto turn it off on interface.\n\n283\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.210\nOnce I do run it turns it off,\nturns it on everything.\n\n284\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.240\nAnd then we're gonna say no LLDP\ntransmit or no LLDP receive.\n\n285\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.589\nIt's kinda interesting that way\nbecause I can leave the receive on but\n\n286\n00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:25.130\nnot send information, right?\n\n287\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.280\nSo I can gather my CDP table but\n\n288\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.200\nnot tell anyone about me,\nthat I'm in the neighborhood.\n\n289\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.284\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n290\n00:14:30.284 --> 00:14:31.339\nAll right, let's take a look.\n\n291\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.920\nI'm gonna go out here to my switch again.\n\n292\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.950\nThese routers,\nnot all Cisco devices support LLDP and\n\n293\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.640\nI noticed these routers did not.\n\n294\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.906\nOkay, so config t lldp run.\n\n295\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.660\nOkay, that was kinda hard.\n\n296\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.235\nOkay, time for a shot.\n\n297\n00:14:49.235 --> 00:14:51.115\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We got LLDP working.\n\n298\n00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:55.660\n[LAUGH] Do show lldp and\nwe can do some verification commands,\n\n299\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.850\nneighbors, same thing actually.\n\n300\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.005\nAt this point here.\n\n301\n00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:04.585\nShow, I did LTP didn't I?\n\n302\n00:15:04.585 --> 00:15:05.975\nOr no, so LLDP.\n\n303\n00:15:05.975 --> 00:15:08.175\nFirst thing we'll take\na look at is the timers.\n\n304\n00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:10.675\nSo remember the other ones were 60 and\n180.\n\n305\n00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:13.475\nThese are 30 and 120 isn't it?\n\n306\n00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.205\nAll right, so we're gonna hold it for, so\n\n307\n00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:19.800\n30's probably a more realistic number\nthese days, right, on something like this.\n\n308\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.830\nShow lldp.\n\n309\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:27.390\nOkay, and now we can see we\nhave the entry asterisk, right?\n\n310\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.710\nWe have neighbors.\n\n311\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.603\nWe have interface, so show lldp neighbors.\n\n312\n00:15:31.603 --> 00:15:32.603\nSee if I have any neighbors out there.\n\n313\n00:15:32.603 --> 00:15:35.480\n[LAUGH] I've gotta go turn on some\nother device so I can get a neighbor.\n\n314\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.920\nSo let's run out there real quick,\nand go over to my other switch here.\n\n315\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.436\nAnd Ronnie,\nI'm going to have you talk me through,\n\n316\n00:15:41.436 --> 00:15:43.467\nbecause I can't remember\nhow to turn on LLDP.\n\n317\n00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:44.160\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n318\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.410\n>> What should I do?\n\n319\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.950\n>> We need to into the global\nconfiguration mode.\n\n320\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:48.540\n>> Okay.\n\n321\n00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.611\n>> And then it's lldp run.\n\n322\n00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:52.837\n>> All right, Ronnie, thank you.\n\n323\n00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:54.994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was stressing out there for a second.\n\n324\n00:15:54.994 --> 00:15:57.185\n>> Do you take a shot or\ndo I take a shot on that one?\n\n325\n00:15:57.185 --> 00:15:58.262\n>> [LAUGH] I think we both will.\n\n326\n00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:01.512\n[LAUGH] And everyone out there\nneeds to take a shot now too.\n\n327\n00:16:01.512 --> 00:16:02.798\nCome on, this is a drinking game.\n\n328\n00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:04.037\nWhenever we do anything right.\n\n329\n00:16:04.037 --> 00:16:06.038\n[LAUGH] My gosh.\n\n330\n00:16:06.038 --> 00:16:07.729\n>> You're saying we're gonna do\neverything right today, I guess.\n\n331\n00:16:07.729 --> 00:16:11.180\n>> Yeah.\n>> Show lldp neighbor.\n\n332\n00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.677\nNothing yet, so at 30 seconds,\nI think these guys are even.\n\n333\n00:16:14.677 --> 00:16:16.323\nLet's do [INAUDIBLE].\n\n334\n00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:17.760\nI don't even know if they're connected.\n\n335\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.490\nShow cdp neighbor,\nI don't even see my other switch.\n\n336\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.860\nI must have it turned off.\n\n337\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.700\nAnyways, that's fine, it shows us the same\ninformation and then Linux host and so on.\n\n338\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.083\nSo turn on LLDP for your objectives, not\na lot of verification on LLDP in the sense\n\n339\n00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:35.158\nof the objectives, how to turn off and\non on your interfaces and globally.\n\n340\n00:16:38.687 --> 00:16:41.710\nAll right, now another big objective here.\n\n341\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.476\nI think I should say that\nabout everything I start-\n\n342\n00:16:43.476 --> 00:16:43.989\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:45.760\n>> Because honestly if it's not\n\n344\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.820\na big objective, it's just basically\nnot talked about here, all right?\n\n345\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.190\nSo I guess we'll just use\nthat as a de facto statement.\n\n346\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.770\nAll right, to make your router\na DHCP server and to verify,\n\n347\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.660\nthe other thing is we're\ngoing to troubleshoot DHCP.\n\n348\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.830\nThose are all the objectives.\n\n349\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.642\nSo we also got some other options in here\nthat we haven't had in the past objective.\n\n350\n00:17:02.642 --> 00:17:06.272\nSo they have so many objectives on DHCP\nin this new one that I've got it in\n\n351\n00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:09.480\nthree different chapters in\nmy book in different facets.\n\n352\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.090\nBecause it's so important.\n\n353\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.250\nLet's take a quick look and then we'll go\nout and configure it in our little app.\n\n354\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.650\nIP DHCP, the first thing I do here,\nguys, is I exclude the addresses.\n\n355\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.710\nNow one of the things I can do, Ronnie,\n\n356\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.868\nthat's kinda interesting here, ip dhcp\nexcluded address, I can do a range here.\n\n357\n00:17:24.868 --> 00:17:26.630\n192.168.10.1 space 192.168.10.,\n\n358\n00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:32.320\nwhoops I don't have an affirm here,\n10.20 or something.\n\n359\n00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.220\nSo now I've just reserved 20 addresses,\nright, in that pool,\n\n360\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.540\nso it's not gonna use those.\n\n361\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.865\nAlways start with this first because\nthe minute you type in your network\n\n362\n00:17:41.865 --> 00:17:42.890\nmode after you create your pool,\n\n363\n00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.370\nit's gonna start handing out addresses\nif it gets a discover request.\n\n364\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.858\nOkay we should go over that Ronnie right,\n\n365\n00:17:48.858 --> 00:17:52.636\neveryone should know here what's\na client do when it comes up?\n\n366\n00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:55.180\nWhat's the four step process\nof talking with a server and\n\n367\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.630\nthen we'll watch that with the debugging.\n\n368\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.340\nIt's the DORA process,\nthe DHCP discover, and\n\n369\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.120\nthen the Offer, the Request,\nand the Acknowledgement.\n\n370\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.270\n>> Right, all right.\n\n371\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.597\nSo, what do you got, only 39 more\nquestions on your CCENT here now?\n\n372\n00:18:08.597 --> 00:18:10.487\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n373\n00:18:10.487 --> 00:18:12.921\n[LAUGH]\n>> He's got his DORA down, man.\n\n374\n00:18:12.921 --> 00:18:16.712\nAll right, then we create a pool, one for\neach VLAN that you're going to use,\n\n375\n00:18:16.712 --> 00:18:19.425\none for each LAN, whichever one,\nip dhcp pool LAN_A.\n\n376\n00:18:19.425 --> 00:18:21.638\nI'm gonna create one for San Francisco and\n\n377\n00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:23.924\nLA because we have those\nremote LANs there.\n\n378\n00:18:23.924 --> 00:18:28.750\nNetwork 192.168.10.0,\nthis is off of my San Francisco router.\n\n379\n00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.736\nI put my dns-server and then my\ndefault gateway but wait there's more.\n\n380\n00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:34.439\nAnd I don't have this in here,\nI'm gonna show you,\n\n381\n00:18:34.439 --> 00:18:35.980\nthere's something called Options.\n\n382\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.690\nOptions allow us to get\nvendor information.\n\n383\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.260\nOption 43 is specific vendor information.\n\n384\n00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.599\nBut we're gonna talk about something for\nthe exam, and\n\n385\n00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:47.454\nyou're going to remember this, Option 66.\n\n386\n00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:53.256\nI'm gonna put this down here,\nI type in option 66, and we're gonna say,\n\n387\n00:18:53.256 --> 00:18:59.619\nask the information and then we're just\ngonna list a fully qualified domain here.\n\n388\n00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:03.750\nHow do you spell it, fully qualified\ndomain name here for my TF3 server.\n\n389\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.520\nSo what this does is give, and\nthis is a great example of this, you have\n\n390\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:14.380\na TFGP phone, you have a VoIP phone,\nright, and it needs an operating system.\n\n391\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.910\nIt boots up, and you need a THP server.\n\n392\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.983\nSo when it gets a DHCP address,\nit's gonna look for.\n\n393\n00:19:20.983 --> 00:19:25.565\nWe're gonna send it this information along\nwith option 66 that tells us where the THP\n\n394\n00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:26.450\nserver is.\n\n395\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.070\nWhat I just told you is a CCENT objective.\n\n396\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.190\nI'm gonna show this to you as well,\nall right?\n\n397\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.780\nSo now, hosts receive, this important too,\nwe can change the timers.\n\n398\n00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.790\nNow by default, a Cisco router\nrunning as a server, a Cisco switch,\n\n399\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.200\nwhatever it is,\nis going to send it for 24 hours.\n\n400\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.770\nBut we can change those timers.\n\n401\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.490\nI usually don't screw with them but\nyou can.\n\n402\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.170\nHosts now,\nat every 33% decrement of the time,\n\n403\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:57.070\nwill try to send another DORA and\nget its lease renewed.\n\n404\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.310\nRight if that doesn't happen 33% of\nthat time left and so, excuse me, and so\n\n405\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.780\non until it basically is five\ntimes then it kind of gives up and\n\n406\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.660\ndoesn't have an address.\n\n407\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.790\nThen we end up with that what?\n\n408\n00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.891\nThat old crap address the PIPA address,\nright.\n\n409\n00:20:09.891 --> 00:20:11.432\nWe're like man, all right.\n\n410\n00:20:11.432 --> 00:20:14.820\nSo, the client request looks like this,\nright.\n\n411\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:20.289\nWe have our Layer 3, 255,\nour source layer looks like,\n\n412\n00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:23.360\nwhat's our source layer 3 look like?\n\n413\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.270\nIt's a valid address, but\ncan't do anything with it.\n\n414\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:31.170\nAll zeros here right, quad zeros,\nthat's my source, source IP.\n\n415\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:37.730\nMy source MAC is actually a unicast\nbecause, or just, my actually MAC address,\n\n416\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.200\nwe know that source MAC address, that's\nall we really know about the DHCP client.\n\n417\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.210\nIt's gonna come here, is this gonna work?\n\n418\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.470\nYeah, most of the time, if it's configured\nright, we're gonna get a DHCP address,\n\n419\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.520\ncuz we're gonna broadcast, right?\n\n420\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.804\nPort 67 boot p.\n\n421\n00:20:52.801 --> 00:20:54.852\nAll right, and\nit's gonna respond with port 68 and\n\n422\n00:20:54.852 --> 00:20:56.640\ngive us the information permission, right?\n\n423\n00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.630\nSo this is helpful if\neverything's on the same LAN.\n\n424\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.310\nIt's pretty unlikely today that\nwe're going to have everything on\n\n425\n00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.080\nthe same LAN, right?\n\n426\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.400\nIt's going to be more something like this,\nif we can read this, okay?\n\n427\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.700\nSo here we send the broadcast,\nthe DHCP server is actually here.\n\n428\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.200\nSo it's on the other side of a router.\n\n429\n00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.310\nA router won't forward broadcasts\nby default and that's all this is.\n\n430\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.790\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna take\nthis command here if we can see this.\n\n431\n00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:27.030\nIp helper-address, we're gonna take that\nbroadcast and turn it into a unicast\n\n432\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:32.820\naddress, we're gonna change the actual\ndestination IP address from a broadcast.\n\n433\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.310\nTo the IP address in the helper-address\nand then route it to the DHCP server.\n\n434\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.150\nIt's gonna see which interface that it\ncame from gets something from that pool\n\n435\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.280\nand sends it back.\n\n436\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.747\nAll right so we're going to relay\nthat with the ip helper-address,\n\n437\n00:21:44.747 --> 00:21:46.682\nip helper-address, okay?\n\n438\n00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:48.130\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n439\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.460\nSo it sees this, relays it,\n\n440\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.020\nnow I want to give you guys\na heads up on something like this.\n\n441\n00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.110\nSo it actually forwards seven\ndifferent types of broadcasts,\n\n442\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.930\nincluding the Microsoft ones.\n\n443\n00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.530\nSo you really need to turn those off.\n\n444\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.620\nI have those in my book,\nthe no udp forward protocol and\n\n445\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.120\nthen it's going to list them.\n\n446\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.910\nSo when you turn this on,\nthen you're gonna do config t and\n\n447\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:11.540\nyou're gonna type that command in six\ntimes to turn off those other broadcasts,\n\n448\n00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.890\nbecause if not you're forwarding all\nthat Microsoft, 137, 135 and so on.\n\n449\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.890\nAnd you don't wanna do that, right?\n\n450\n00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.770\nLook that up if you're doing this and\nturn those UDP forwarding protocols off.\n\n451\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:28.200\nSo I think, yeah, before we go to NTP,\nlet's go out and configure this, right?\n\n452\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.000\nIf it doesn't work,\nit's a great troubleshooting opportunity.\n\n453\n00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.190\nIt's part of the objectives.\n\n454\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.860\nAll right, so I'm gonna start down here.\n\n455\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.230\nThe first thing I'm gonna do\nis I have a LAN off of my,\n\n456\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.470\nlet's take a look at my network here,\nnice little drawing.\n\n457\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.950\nSo I'm down here at Corp and\nI have a LAN up here.\n\n458\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.200\nI have a couple loopback interfaces,\ndiagnostic interfaces,\n\n459\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.410\nthat we can use to help us test routing,\nroute through the router.\n\n460\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.610\nWe'll take a look at that in a minute.\n\n461\n00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.290\nAs well as just give us other LANs,\n\n462\n00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.365\nlike the indications of LANs,\nstuff to make our network look bigger.\n\n463\n00:23:03.365 --> 00:23:05.300\n[LAUGH] Anyway, so\n\n464\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.450\nwe have a LAN here with some switches\noff here that I can use as DHCP clients.\n\n465\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.430\nAnd so I'm gonna create pools here.\n\n466\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.240\nThe broadcasts are gonna come in here, and\n\n467\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.450\nthen we're gonna forward those to this\nrouter here where my DHP server is.\n\n468\n00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.460\nSound good guys?\n\n469\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.290\nLet's do it!\n\n470\n00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.346\nSo here is my Corp.\n\n471\n00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:26.070\nCreate cup.\n\n472\n00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.840\nThe first thing I have got to do though\nis the reserved addresses, remember?\n\n473\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.367\nSo from global config,\nip dhcp excluded addresses,\n\n474\n00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:37.789\nthe command 192.68.10.1,\n\n475\n00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:43.334\nthat is my San Francisco, or,\nyeah, and then my LA is 20.1.\n\n476\n00:23:43.334 --> 00:23:45.850\nThose are the default\ngateways of those LANs.\n\n477\n00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:46.977\nSo, I don't wanna put those in.\n\n478\n00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:52.605\nAll right, so now that I've got\nmy excluded addresses in, first,\n\n479\n00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:58.943\nI'm just gonna create two pools, one for\neach that I need, ip dchp pool SF.\n\n480\n00:23:58.943 --> 00:24:02.480\nAnd then, unlike the Microsoft DHP\nserver's kinda cool really,\n\n481\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.737\nbecause I can sit there and say I wanna\ngive out 102.168.10.10 through 10.20.\n\n482\n00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:11.230\nI can't do that, I have to actually do\nthat in block sizes on this Cisco right?\n\n483\n00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.140\nSo I'm gonna say block 256 here, 10.0 and\n\n484\n00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.800\nthen by putting in the mask it knows what\nit can hand out, plus the reserved here.\n\n485\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.320\nAnd then we're gonna put\nthe default router in.\n\n486\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.160\n192.168.10.1, and\nthen we can put our dns, whatever.\n\n487\n00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.740\nThese are kind of the minimums, right?\n\n488\n00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.260\nThese three things are the minimums.\n\n489\n00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.870\nIP address, Subnet mask, and\nDefault Gateway, and, dns-server.\n\n490\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.710\nBut, wait, there's more.\n\n491\n00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.190\nAll right, so we're gonna say option,\nso check this out.\n\n492\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.352\nGo out and do this lab guys, and\nthen do option, question mark, and\n\n493\n00:24:44.352 --> 00:24:47.033\n[INAUDIBLE] 0-254 absolutely\nno help there, is it?\n\n494\n00:24:47.033 --> 00:24:49.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely none.\n\n495\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.270\nSo we're gonna do option 66, actually\nprobably just Google DHCP option codes,\n\n496\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.010\nand then you'll be able to\nget an idea of what they are.\n\n497\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.760\nThe typical option codes,\nI use option 43 for\n\n498\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.470\nspecific vendor information\nin the wireless world.\n\n499\n00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:09.005\nAnd also then option 66 for\nthe VoIP phones for TFTP.\n\n500\n00:25:09.005 --> 00:25:11.080\nYou might use this for other things,\nbut this is what it is.\n\n501\n00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.900\nSo now we're just gonna be an ASCII file,\nand\n\n502\n00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.440\nthen we have to put in a fully\nqualified domain name, so\n\n503\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.660\nI'm gonna type in tftp.lammle.com,\nright, something like that.\n\n504\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.180\nSo now I have that in there, and\n\n505\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:28.070\nthis is gonna be sent when someone gets\na DNS they're also gonna get the TNF.\n\n506\n00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.180\nI'm sorry, the dhcp address they're\nalso going to get the tftp, so\n\n507\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.920\nnow they can download that.\n\n508\n00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:39.776\nAll right, so let's create another pool,\n\n509\n00:25:39.776 --> 00:25:48.126\nip dhcp pool LA network 192.168.20.0.\n\n510\n00:25:48.126 --> 00:25:49.106\nWe're creating a pool.\n\n511\n00:25:49.106 --> 00:25:53.569\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And default router, 192.168.20,\n\n512\n00:25:53.569 --> 00:25:55.972\nthat's where I put the 20.1.\n\n513\n00:25:55.972 --> 00:26:00.541\nDns, 8.8.8.8, and\nI don't have any VoIP phones there, so\n\n514\n00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:03.460\nI'm not going to put the TFTP server.\n\n515\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.670\nThat's about it guys, here's what I did,\n\n516\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.750\npretty simple, excluded my default\ngateways, created a pull for\n\n517\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.080\nSan Francisco LAN, created a pull for\nLA LAN, that's all there is to it.\n\n518\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.521\nOkay can go back here,\nlet's go out to LA and San Francisco.\n\n519\n00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:23.820\nSo what do I have to do\nhere on this router?\n\n520\n00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.440\nThe DHP server's over here, but\n\n521\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.175\nI need to forward the DHP requests,\nright, that come in.\n\n522\n00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:34.245\nThey're broadcasts, and\nthey're gonna come in,\n\n523\n00:26:34.245 --> 00:26:36.985\nso let's take a look here\nat my interfaces, right?\n\n524\n00:26:36.985 --> 00:26:39.735\nSo let me step back for\na second, open this back up, and\n\n525\n00:26:39.735 --> 00:26:41.115\nmake sure we have the right interfaces.\n\n526\n00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:43.325\nI don't have those listed here,\nso that's not gonna help me.\n\n527\n00:26:43.325 --> 00:26:46.175\nSo, this is a real-life situation here,\nguys.\n\n528\n00:26:46.175 --> 00:26:47.505\nYou gotta figure out your interface.\n\n529\n00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:51.420\nSo what commands can I type in to figure\nout which interface my LANs are on?\n\n530\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.074\nWhat do you think?\n\n531\n00:26:53.074 --> 00:26:57.270\nShow IP interface brief, show protocols.\n\n532\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.210\nThose are all great commands aren't they?\n\n533\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.570\nSo show, both great commands,\nshow ip int brief, okay.\n\n534\n00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.214\nSo there's my 192.168.10.1 off of f0/0.\n\n535\n00:27:07.214 --> 00:27:12.740\nAll right, so I'm gonna say config t,\ninterface f0/0.\n\n536\n00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.070\nNow you put the helper address\non the interface that receives\n\n537\n00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.920\nthe broadcast, okay?\n\n538\n00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:26.538\nSo I'm gonna say ip\nhelper-address 172.16.10.1.\n\n539\n00:27:26.538 --> 00:27:28.590\nAll right, that's my closest interface.\n\n540\n00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.540\nI can use any interface\non the Corp router.\n\n541\n00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.000\nIn this case this is the one I'm\ndirectly connected to, all right?\n\n542\n00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.320\nSo if that's the case, whoops.\n\n543\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.300\nWe can see, now,\nhopefully this won't work,\n\n544\n00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.940\nbecause we want\na troubleshooting opportunity.\n\n545\n00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:50.736\nInterface, vlan 1, I'll explain what\nthat means, I'm just using this as a DHP\n\n546\n00:27:50.736 --> 00:27:56.795\nclient, we'll get to switching in the next\naction, actually, ip address, dhcp.\n\n547\n00:27:56.795 --> 00:28:03.300\nAll right, so I'm just telling\nthis client to use a DHCP, right.\n\n548\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.430\nSo, now we can come over here and look.\n\n549\n00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.220\nWow, it worked.\n\n550\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.716\nDarn it.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n551\n00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:09.645\n>> No troubleshooting opportunity there.\n\n552\n00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:12.620\nAll right, [LAUGH] so he got an address.\n\n553\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.740\nMy pool worked, my relay worked, right.\n\n554\n00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.711\nLet's see if I can screw this\nother one up, all right.\n\n555\n00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:21.115\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's go to LA.\n\n556\n00:28:24.825 --> 00:28:29.033\nAll right, so show ip int brief.\n\n557\n00:28:31.822 --> 00:28:34.303\nOkay, 192.168.20.1.\n\n558\n00:28:34.303 --> 00:28:35.570\nSo I'm gonna do this.\n\n559\n00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:43.072\nI'm gonna add the interface f0/0,\n\n560\n00:28:43.072 --> 00:28:50.262\nip helper-address 172.16.10.5\n\n561\n00:28:50.262 --> 00:28:55.810\nif we look at my interfaces here.\n\n562\n00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:02.260\nI'm going to relay it here,\nthis is 172.16.10.5 right here.\n\n563\n00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.320\nSo we're sending it to\nthe directly connected one,\n\n564\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.390\nagain I can send it to\nany interface on there.\n\n565\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.261\nIs this one gonna work, Ronnie?\n\n566\n00:29:08.261 --> 00:29:09.706\nProbably not.\n\n567\n00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:10.636\n>> Yeah.\n\n568\n00:29:10.636 --> 00:29:11.830\n>> [LAUGH] I'm going to say not.\n\n569\n00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:16.240\nI did something on purpose here so\nwe had a troubleshooting opportunity.\n\n570\n00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.320\nSo take a look here,\nI'm gonna go to this switch.\n\n571\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.130\nNow don't worry about this VLAN1 thing,\nI'll get to that.\n\n572\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.232\nIp address dhcp.\n\n573\n00:29:24.232 --> 00:29:26.975\nAll right, now so it's out there trying,\nit's not gonna get it.\n\n574\n00:29:26.975 --> 00:29:28.830\n[COUGH] Oops,\nI'll show you why in a minute.\n\n575\n00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.170\nBut here's what I want to do guys.\n\n576\n00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.700\nYou absolutely have to be able to\ntroubleshoot DHCP on the CCNT.\n\n577\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.200\nSo here's what I'm gonna do.\n\n578\n00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.420\nDebug ip dhcp,\n\n579\n00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.870\nquestion mark server, and\nthere's a couple things we can do here.\n\n580\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.910\nThe ones you really wanna\nuse are events and packets.\n\n581\n00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.630\nSo, I'm just gonna do packets here, with\na p, and I'm also gonna do events, right?\n\n582\n00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.820\nI'll type out the command.\n\n583\n00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.020\nWell, not type it out,\nI'll hit my tab key.\n\n584\n00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:56.900\nIt'll go out of the way.\n\n585\n00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.810\nSo, now in this case here, I'm gonna shut\ndown the interface that's connected in,\n\n586\n00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:01.420\ncuz it's a router.\n\n587\n00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.430\nIf it was a client I could do a release\nrenew or something like that.\n\n588\n00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.940\nAnd then a no shot, and that'll force\nit to try to go get an address, so\n\n589\n00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.340\nI should see some DHCP stuff.\n\n590\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.960\nAnd let's see what we're seeing,\nhopefully it's useful, all right?\n\n591\n00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.272\nSo let's see what it's doing.\n\n592\n00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:19.003\nThere's my door right, DISCOVER,\nnow let's go to corp and\n\n593\n00:30:19.003 --> 00:30:21.430\nsee if it's being forwarded, right.\n\n594\n00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:27.333\nSo I'm gonna do this,\n\n595\n00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:33.587\ndebug ip dhcp server events,\n\n596\n00:30:33.587 --> 00:30:39.100\nand server packets okay.\n\n597\n00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.650\nSo let's try that again and\nsee if it's getting forwarded.\n\n598\n00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.230\nSee it being forwarded.\n\n599\n00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.890\nSee it being forwarded?\n\n600\n00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.660\nSo we're definitely getting a discover.\n\n601\n00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.460\n>> Right.\n\n602\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.844\n>> But see it's looking for\nan internal pool, right?\n\n603\n00:30:53.844 --> 00:30:59.270\nIt's not forwarding it, or knowing that\nit should be forwarded, all right?\n\n604\n00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.280\nIt's a lot easier since I\nknow what the problem is.\n\n605\n00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But when you're getting this at work,\n\n606\n00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.160\nit gets a little confusing when\nyou see something like this.\n\n607\n00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.700\nYou wanna start with the basics,\nall right?\n\n608\n00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.970\nWe wanna check our configs.\n\n609\n00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.690\nI'm not seeing it on the server here,\nright?\n\n610\n00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:13.220\nI'm getting the discover message.\n\n611\n00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.560\nI'm just only looking internally.\n\n612\n00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.080\nIt doesn't know I can forward it.\n\n613\n00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.817\nSo that means we're gonna go in and\ntake a look at the configuration.\n\n614\n00:31:25.017 --> 00:31:29.057\nOkay, first off, I'm gonna undo debug all.\n\n615\n00:31:32.247 --> 00:31:33.447\nOkay.\n\n616\n00:31:33.447 --> 00:31:36.977\n[COUGH] Yeah,\nit's running a little bit slow.\n\n617\n00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:40.227\nOn debug also, I did that so\nI can do my troubleshooting.\n\n618\n00:31:40.227 --> 00:31:45.363\nSo we could do a show run\ninterface fast ethernet 0/0.\n\n619\n00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:51.613\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, and so I see my helper address,\n\n620\n00:31:51.613 --> 00:31:55.652\nbut I don't see an IP\naddress on this interface.\n\n621\n00:31:55.652 --> 00:32:00.056\nOkay, so I put my helper address where\nwhat I thought was in the right place.\n\n622\n00:32:00.056 --> 00:32:01.458\nOn my LAN interface.\n\n623\n00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:09.110\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo a show ip int brief.\n\n624\n00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.518\nCome on, man.\n\n625\n00:32:14.397 --> 00:32:19.319\nLet's go ahead and\ntry to do a show [SOUND].\n\n626\n00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:21.014\nThere, wow.\n\n627\n00:32:21.014 --> 00:32:22.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Man,\n\n628\n00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.605\nthis like

right.\n\n633\n00:32:41.636 --> 00:32:45.228\n[LAUGH] Keeping me slow so\nI'm not going too fast for you guys.\n\n634\n00:32:45.228 --> 00:32:48.370\nI definitely have my IP\naddress there right, but\n\n635\n00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.410\nI didn't put my helper address\non the right interface here.\n\n636\n00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.670\nWe saw the discover coming in.\n\n637\n00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.900\nWe didn't see it forwarded.\n\n638\n00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.690\nIt was saying I'm looking for\nan internal pool right.\n\n639\n00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.210\nSo config t if I can, come on baby.\n\n640\n00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:12.011\nOkay, interface f0/1, IP helper address.\n\n641\n00:33:12.011 --> 00:33:15.331\nWhat's that, 172.16.10.5.\n\n642\n00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.148\n>> You have overwhelmed the processor.\n\n643\n00:33:19.148 --> 00:33:25.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] My gosh.\n\n644\n00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.573\nOkay, and then-\n>> There it goes.\n\n645\n00:33:26.573 --> 00:33:30.980\n>> Ctrl+Z, and to catch who our,\nprobably already got an IP address,\n\n646\n00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.220\nthe thing is going so slow.\n\n647\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.889\nIPDHCP, whoops, that's not what I want.\n\n648\n00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:46.300\nDebug ip dhcp server events,\nand let's do packets.\n\n649\n00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.342\nAnd then if it doesn't do that,\ncome on man.\n\n650\n00:33:49.342 --> 00:33:58.130\nAll right so, let's go out here,\nand really happy about this.\n\n651\n00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:01.180\n>> There it goes.\n\n652\n00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.100\n>> Yeah, it's doing it without me.\n\n653\n00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.810\nSo this guy, it didn't look\nlike it still worked though.\n\n654\n00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.061\n>> Let's see, I think you're getting\nresponses on both sides now.\n\n655\n00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:10.450\n>> See, wow that's slow.\n\n656\n00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:11.550\nYeah it did, 20.2.\n\n657\n00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:16.960\nAll right, so very easy troubleshooting\n[LAUGH] connectivity issues,\n\n658\n00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.100\ngoing slow, maybe slow down a little bit.\n\n659\n00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.840\nWe basically go in, do your debugging,\n\n660\n00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.370\nverify your forward interfaces,\nverify your pools.\n\n661\n00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.160\nA lot of times, you're gonna see\nsomething like pool not available or\n\n662\n00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.069\nsomething like that.\n\n663\n00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:34.586\nSo it's actually, because I was coming\nfrom the 192.168.20 something it might\n\n664\n00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:37.932\nsay, there is no 192.168.20 something\nbecause we typed in the wrong pool.\n\n665\n00:34:37.932 --> 00:34:39.541\nLet's run out to corp, though,\n\n666\n00:34:39.541 --> 00:34:44.190\nand run a couple commands off that server\nthat you're gonna find interesting.\n\n667\n00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.740\nOkay so let's come down here,\nshow ip dhcp again.\n\n668\n00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.840\nPretty big CCNT objective here,\nI'm really gonna push you guys on this.\n\n669\n00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.600\nSo I'm gonna say pool and\nit's gonna tell us things like how many\n\n670\n00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.540\naddresses are released in the time and\nwhat your pool is on and so on.\n\n671\n00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.020\nShow ip dhcp and\n\n672\n00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.060\nthen we can look at one of the other\nthings that there was a conflict.\n\n673\n00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.680\nNow remember this is part\nof the objectives as well.\n\n674\n00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.060\nWhen a host receives a DHCP\naddress from the server\n\n675\n00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.060\nit's gonna send out what's\ncalled a gratuitous ARP, right?\n\n676\n00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.130\nAnd so what it does it says hey, I got\nthis address 192.168.20.2 or whatever it\n\n677\n00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.580\nwas, and it's gonna ARP for it, right,\nand if someone responds it goes, aw man.\n\n678\n00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.950\nIt's gonna tell the server hey,\nthat one's in use.\n\n679\n00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.870\nSo then we'd just do conflict here and\n\n680\n00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:36.060\nwe'd be able to see that the detection\nmethod was gratuitous ARP.\n\n681\n00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.410\nNow before that even happens though,\nthe server,\n\n682\n00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:42.220\nbefore it sends out an address,\nis actually gonna try to ping the address.\n\n683\n00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.560\nThe problem with that, and we can\nconfigure that to how many pings it is,\n\n684\n00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.530\nif you ping too much then the DHCP\nclient request times out.\n\n685\n00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.320\nSo it's kind of a, right in the middle-\n>> Balance.\n\n686\n00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.540\n>> So about three would be the max because\nyou need one or two to resolve ARP and\n\n687\n00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.780\nthen your third one,\nif you don't get it by then,\n\n688\n00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:02.440\nit's going to hand out the address just\nin time before the client expires.\n\n689\n00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.770\nSo you need to keep that in mind.\n\n690\n00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.160\nSo we've also,\nwe can look at relay information and\n\n691\n00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.850\nserver information,\nsee if we get something on relay.\n\n692\n00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.710\nBut I really want to do and really I\nhighly recommend you guys doing all of\n\n693\n00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:22.550\nthis and typing these in, looking at\nstatistics, understanding all these.\n\n694\n00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.630\nSo when you see them on the objectives,\n\n695\n00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.680\nwhen you see it on the exam,\nyou've gone through it before.\n\n696\n00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.930\nAll right, that's DHCP again.\n\n697\n00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.551\nRonnie's going to go ahead and\nsummarize this section for us.\n\n698\n00:36:31.551 --> 00:36:36.330\n>> All right, as we actually took\na look in this particular episode.\n\n699\n00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.040\nWe started off by taking a look at CDP and\nhelping us to be able to discover,\n\n700\n00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.940\nof course,\nCisco proprietary devices through that\n\n701\n00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.840\nprotocol that are directly connected\nto whatever device that we're running.\n\n702\n00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.660\nSo that that way we can\nsee those connections and\n\n703\n00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.410\nbe able to actually diagram\nout something that we need to.\n\n704\n00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:56.730\nIf we wanna move also a little bit beyond\nthe realm of Cisco we might also of\n\n705\n00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.110\ncourse, include an LLDP, the Link Layer\nDiscovery Protocol that will help us to do\n\n706\n00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:06.700\nthis, not only with Cisco devices, but\nalso with other vendor devices as well.\n\n707\n00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.730\nAnd especially we call out the idea\nhere of LINUX servers too.\n\n708\n00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:15.110\nNow, we also then turned, and took a look,\nof course, at the configuration of using\n\n709\n00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:19.590\nsomething like a Cisco router for\na DHCP server, and even name resolution.\n\n710\n00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.726\nInside of actually configuring,\nof course, for a DHCP,\n\n711\n00:37:22.726 --> 00:37:27.078\nwe want to make sure we get those elements\nin hand, know the excluded addresses,\n\n712\n00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:30.416\nmake sure we configure our network\npool of addresses as well.\n\n713\n00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:32.706\nUsually the default router, and\n\n714\n00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:36.590\nof course the name servers\nthat we need to configure to.\n\n715\n00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:41.935\nAnd of course the one option that Todd\nabsolutely hammered into our heads here,\n\n716\n00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:43.382\noption number 66.\n\n717\n00:37:43.382 --> 00:37:47.190\nMake sure we get that in there as well for\nour VoIP phones too.\n\n718\n00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:50.167\nAnd then, of course,\nwe did a little bit of troubleshooting and\n\n719\n00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:53.865\nshowed not only the configuration but\nalso troubleshooting when things don't\n\n720\n00:37:53.865 --> 00:37:57.030\nhappen using, of course,\nthe debugging types of commands there.\n\n721\n00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.400\nThat will also help us out as well.\n\n722\n00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.900\nSo all these are gonna be keys, of course,\nto you getting ready for that exam.\n\n723\n00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.710\nRemember that if any of\nthis is challenging,\n\n724\n00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.350\nmake sure you go back and\ndo this lab again.\n\n725\n00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.900\nThis needs to become second nature to you.\n\n726\n00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.480\nYou just don't have enough time on\nthe exam to just kind of fully,\n\n727\n00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.360\njust lay out everything.\n\n728\n00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.120\nSo, I'm just gonna work on\nthis one device at a time.\n\n729\n00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.140\nBy that point,\nyou're gonna run out of time.\n\n730\n00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.510\nSo, make sure you actually are able to\nspot these types of troubles right away.\n\n731\n00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.560\nBe able to actually identify these types\nof protocols that we've been using.\n\n732\n00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.937\nThank you again, Todd, for\nbeing here and leading us thought this.\n\n733\n00:38:29.937 --> 00:38:31.862\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Thank you for joining us,\n\n734\n00:38:31.862 --> 00:38:35.690\nsigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n735\n00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.670\n>> And Todd Lammle.\n\n736\n00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.510\n>> And stay tuned right here for\nmore CCENT content.\n\n737\n00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:46.802\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.050\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.949\ntoday we're continuing on by\ntaking a look at ICND1 content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.790\nGetting ready for that new ICND1 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.790\nHelping us today in our studio\nis gonna be Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n7\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.950\nTodd, welcome back to our studios,\nthank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.940\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\nIt's good to be here on this last section.\n\n9\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.570\nHere we're gonna start taking a look\nat NTP, more objectives again.\n\n10\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.280\nJust like I mentioned last time, if I have\nit on my screen, if I'm talking about it,\n\n11\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.500\nit's an objective and\nit's an important one, right?\n\n12\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.920\nSo let's not skip this, and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and show you a couple things.\n\n13\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.916\nWhat they did is they took a lot\nof the existing objectives and\n\n14\n00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.638\nthen just made them more detailed,\njust like in DHCP.\n\n15\n00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:56.393\nIt was kind of simple last time,\nnow they've got troubleshooting in there,\n\n16\n00:00:56.393 --> 00:00:59.060\nand the options and so on,\nas we just went through.\n\n17\n00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.200\nAll right, let's take a look\nat this network time protocol,\n\n18\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.990\nwhat's the port number?\n\n19\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.136\nWe use UDP port what?\n\n20\n00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:04.756\n>> 123.\n\n21\n00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:07.610\n>> 123 is correct, all right.\n\n22\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.147\nHopefully they'll ask us\nsomething that simple.\n\n23\n00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:09.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n24\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.380\nNTP is we're gonna get a server.\n\n25\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.565\nNow, and\nwe're gonna take a look at this server.\n\n26\n00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:18.210\nSo, you can run a coax up to your roof,\nand put an antenna, so\n\n27\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.070\nit goes like Boulder.\n\n28\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.580\nIt was funny, I lived in Boulder for\na long time, and I couldn't get time.\n\n29\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.620\nBecause maybe I was too close to\nthe antenna, or something like that.\n\n30\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.870\nI'm like, this is, speaking of irony.\n\n31\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.050\nAnyways, correct time allows\nthe tracking of events.\n\n32\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.410\nNow, when we get into the next session,\nSyslog, the reason we're doing this first\n\n33\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.880\nis cuz set up your time, then go to your\nSyslog and tell it to use this time.\n\n34\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.948\nAll right, this is very important, so\nwe can track when events occurred.\n\n35\n00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:42.962\nNow we can put authentication on NTP,\nit sounds kind of weird, but\n\n36\n00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:46.975\nsomeone may come back in, do an attack,\nchange your time back, so\n\n37\n00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:49.648\nyou don't know when it actually occurred.\n\n38\n00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:52.917\nThat's kind of paranoid I suppose,\nbut that is what it means so\n\n39\n00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.265\nwhy you put authentication on here.\n\n40\n00:01:55.265 --> 00:02:00.100\nIt's critical for correct interpretation\nof events within the syslog data, and\n\n41\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.310\nnot only that, if you have\na digital certificate server or\n\n42\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.300\nserver authority,\nwe're gonna need the correct time, right.\n\n43\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.300\nSo we can connect out.\n\n44\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.470\nWe can have a server, and we can connect\nto that server with our devices.\n\n45\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.250\nAnd Cisco wants you to know hey,\ntheir device can be a master server.\n\n46\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.910\nOkay, so can we get the correct time\nfrom an internal or external source.\n\n47\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.690\nLocal master clocks, so,\nwe got a local master clock.\n\n48\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.628\nWe can make our router a master clock.\n\n49\n00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:28.400\nTypically we connect to\na master clock on the Internet.\n\n50\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.610\nIt's free, it used to be really expensive\nin like the 80s when they had it.\n\n51\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.526\nIt was very expensive.\n\n52\n00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:37.710\nGPS or atomic clock and\nrouter connect is that.\n\n53\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.490\nTake a look at this and then we'll go\nout and take a look at our lab here, but\n\n54\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.950\nif I have an NTP server here,\nand they call this a stratum-0.\n\n55\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.860\nWhat that means, I'm directly connected\nto the clock source, that's a stratus-0.\n\n56\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.400\nRight, so you'll get these stratus\nnumbers here and we'll see it down here,\n\n57\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.240\nI think here it is right here.\n\n58\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.507\nIt just says st there and that says 8, so\n\n59\n00:02:57.507 --> 00:03:02.468\nI'm actually 8 devices away from the\nstratus-0, right, the actual clock source.\n\n60\n00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:04.908\nNot necessarily a bad thing, this one's 9.\n\n61\n00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:06.433\nI think you can get up to 15 and\n\n62\n00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.670\nsays you basically can't get\ncaught time from here, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.310\nSo in this case here and\nchose here the Corp says, hey\n\n64\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.889\nget my server here and then San Francisco\nyou get your time from me, right.\n\n65\n00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.960\nSo NTP server 10.1.1.2.\n\n66\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.080\nI typically don't configure it this way,\nbut this is the objectives.\n\n67\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.590\nAll right,\nI typically take San Francisco and\n\n68\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.180\ngo right to the source, that's just me.\n\n69\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.360\nBut, so you don't have to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.880\nAnd then if I do show ntp associations,\nI'll see 10.1.1.2,\n\n71\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.020\nI'm connected to Corp here.\n\n72\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.860\nThere's a reference clock,\nit's a stratus-8 and so on.\n\n73\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.030\nAnd right here,\nit's clock is synchronized.\n\n74\n00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.960\nAnd of course I'm 9, because he was 8.\n\n75\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.120\nAll right, let's take a quick gander,\n\n76\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.150\ntake a look at this real quick and\nsee what we can do.\n\n77\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.880\nI'm not gonna configure a bunch of time,\nbut\n\n78\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.020\nif I said config t ntp,\nand we got a lot of stuff.\n\n79\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.228\nLet's do authentication,\ncuz I might break in and change your time.\n\n80\n00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:05.270\n[LAUGH] I mean, I don't know.\n\n81\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.520\n[LAUGH] I like to say NTP panic,\nthat's awesome.\n\n82\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.890\nAnyway, NTP master is what\nI'm looking for, right?\n\n83\n00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.268\nSo I've got master, and\nthen I can set my stratum number, right?\n\n84\n00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:20.160\nI was saying stratus, it's stratum.\n\n85\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.250\nWhat's my stratum number?\n\n86\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.738\nAnd the fact is I can't be zero,\nright, but I can be a one.\n\n87\n00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:28.430\nAll right, cuz that means I'm directly\nconnected to that time source.\n\n88\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.880\nNo one can be a zero, except for\nthe atomic clocks, right.\n\n89\n00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.880\nSo anyway, so I can just set that here and\nsay I'm ntp master one, so\n\n90\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.480\neveryone in my corporation\nwould then connect to me.\n\n91\n00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.286\nStratum, I was saying it backwards, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:46.860\nSyslog, really huge objective.\n\n93\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.396\nThis is new for the CCENT,\nso this is a new objective.\n\n94\n00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:53.060\nIt wasn't new for the CCNA,\nnew for the C, it was in ICND2.\n\n95\n00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.280\nNow on Syslog,\nwhat it does is allows us to get messages.\n\n96\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.220\nNow, remember the Cisco router has,\nthere's eight different\n\n97\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.610\nsyslog messages and it's enable,\nby default, to get all those messages.\n\n98\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.240\nOut, you're calling support, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.480\nSo [COUGH] all of those\ncome out your port.\n\n100\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.210\nWe can make it come out our vty\nlines if we're Telnet or SSHN.\n\n101\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.570\nWe can also send those,\nlet's take a look here.\n\n102\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.520\nThis is kind of an objective down here.\n\n103\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.760\nWhere can we send all this?\n\n104\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.550\nWhere do I get information?\n\n105\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.040\nThe logging buffer, and\nto see my syslog messages in RAM.\n\n106\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.250\nI just have a small amount,\nthough, of room.\n\n107\n00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.650\nSo show log, right?\n\n108\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.470\nAnd that's gonna give it to me but\nwe're not gonna get a lot of\n\n109\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.860\ngreat information and remember to make\nthis work, we need our NTP server,\n\n110\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.470\nthat's why I did that right before this.\n\n111\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.810\nThe terminal lines, so\n\n112\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.550\nwhat's the command if I'm Telnetted in and\nit's on another screen coming up.\n\n113\n00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.970\nBut if I'm Telnetted in or SSH-ed in,\nright, I don't get any console messages or\n\n114\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.370\nI don't any syslogs, so\nit'll go right to the console.\n\n115\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.880\nSo how do I get them to\ncome out my vty lines?\n\n116\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.076\n>> Monitor terminal.\n>> Close.\n\n117\n00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:52.520\n>> Terminal monitor.\n\n118\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.890\n>> Right,\nnow this isn't from Global Config.\n\n119\n00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.050\nIt's from within your session.\n\n120\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.520\nTerminal monitor,\nit's only good for that session.\n\n121\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.200\nSo any time my Telnet ends,\nso it's not a configuration.\n\n122\n00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.590\nIt's just something we're turning on for\nthat vty session at that time.\n\n123\n00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.100\nTerminal monitor is the full command,\nand then of course they come out by\n\n124\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.610\nthe console line by default, and\nthen I can send them to a syslog server.\n\n125\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.590\nNow here's the hard part guys.\n\n126\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.436\nWe have to remember these.\n\n127\n00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:19.925\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n128\n00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:24.684\nYou have to, because you're gonna get\nsomething on objectives that says\n\n129\n00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:28.820\nyou've turned on sys warnings,\nsyslog warnings, right?\n\n130\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.760\nThey also by the way, the default\nlevel is what's called local 7, right?\n\n131\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.980\nAnd that's basically this here,\n\n132\n00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.080\nso, local 7 is just another\nway to say the same thing.\n\n133\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.590\nAll right, so I can call debugging,\nseverity 7, local 7, knock yourself out.\n\n134\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.930\nAnyways, it's easy to kind of see\non the screen to be honest to you,\n\n135\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.600\nbecause they're in order,\n0 through 7, all eight of them.\n\n136\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.270\nSo if someone said,\nhey I turned on warnings, that means I'm\n\n137\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.600\nactually gonna get messages for warnings,\nerrors, critical, alerts and emergencies.\n\n138\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.959\nAll right, you get that and\neverything below you.\n\n139\n00:06:58.982 --> 00:07:02.700\nAll right, so it gets kind of hard though,\nto remember this when you're sitting in\n\n140\n00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.540\nfront of the, you're taking the exam\nwhen your kind of anxietized and\n\n141\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.920\nyou got to try to remember this.\n\n142\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.290\nSo maybe we can come up with something\nthat will help them remember it Ronnie.\n\n143\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.579\nAnyways, Syslog Server\n\n144\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.530\nprovides the storage space\nnecessary to store large files.\n\n145\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.212\nShow log is just isn't enough right.\n\n146\n00:07:17.212 --> 00:07:20.808\nMore syslog messages, so\nI am not a big SNMP fan.\n\n147\n00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:23.448\nSure you get some nice sites and\neverything, Syslog gives me a much more\n\n148\n00:07:23.448 --> 00:07:26.070\ndetailed information about\nan error that I'm getting.\n\n149\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.250\nSyslog helps aggregation of logs and\n\n150\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.150\nalerts and also helps me by I can set\nthe time in there with my NTP server, and\n\n151\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.660\nthen tell it,\nmake sure you time stamp this, all right?\n\n152\n00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.590\nNow they're stored, as we just mentioned,\nin the RAM, sent to the console, or\n\n153\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.640\nsent to the Syslog server, right?\n\n154\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.900\nAnd with terminal monitor\nwe can send it down.\n\n155\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.910\nNow take a look here guys,\nI wanna show you something.\n\n156\n00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.778\nIf I wanna set my different levels,\n7 is the default and I wanna change that.\n\n157\n00:07:49.778 --> 00:07:53.765\nSo I'm gonna say logging trap warnings or\nI can type the number.\n\n158\n00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.166\nLogging trap warning and\n\n159\n00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:59.782\nI'm setting it to warnings now I'm gonna\nsay look at it down here, there it is.\n\n160\n00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:00.484\nThere's warning.\n\n161\n00:08:00.484 --> 00:08:04.270\nSo what is gonna be sent, what message\nis gonna be sent if I type this in?\n\n162\n00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.930\nWell, it looks like all of them.\n\n163\n00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.010\nWell, this is kind of annoying, isn't it?\n\n164\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.050\nBecause if I go into Cisco router or\nswitch and say,\n\n165\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:16.560\nlogging trap question mark, it doesn't\ngive it to me in order of the information.\n\n166\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.147\nIt gives it to me in alphabetical order.\n\n167\n00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:21.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing more annoying than this.\n\n168\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.030\nSo I can't tell really.\n\n169\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.757\nI have to look at this and see which\nones they are, I can't even tell.\n\n170\n00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:29.811\nI'm gonna have to come over here to\nthe severity and go backwards and\n\n171\n00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.440\nread them all this way.\n\n172\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.390\nBut we have another way of remembering\nthat, because here what I did is I\n\n173\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.020\nput them in order here, but\nthere's an acronym that I use.\n\n174\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:47.895\nCheck this out, I'm not gonna write\nthem out, every awesome Cisco engineer,\n\n175\n00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:53.160\nwill need ice cream daily.\n\n176\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.630\nOkay?\n\n177\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.100\nRepeat after me, this is like doing\nyour 16s, then you got to do this too.\n\n178\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.730\nEvery awesome Cisco engineer\nwill need ice cream daily.\n\n179\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.590\nOkay, that's the way to remember this.\n\n180\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.130\nSo if someone comes up and says,\nyou have a severity three.\n\n181\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.740\nYou can figure it for\n\n182\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.350\nseverity three what error messages\nare gonna be sent to your syslog server.\n\n183\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.130\nWell, every awesome Cisco engineer.\n\n184\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.340\nWhat did we do?\nErrors.\n\n185\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.450\nSo emergency, alerts,\ncriticals and errors.\n\n186\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.630\nSo you're gonna have to remember this.\n\n187\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.580\nAnd this is a way to remember it.\n\n188\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.532\nI think it's a pretty good way.\n\n189\n00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:31.498\nEvery awesome Cisco engineer\nwill need ice cream daily.\n\n190\n00:09:31.498 --> 00:09:32.359\nAll right.\n\n191\n00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:37.127\n[COUGH] Okay only 38 questions to go now.\n\n192\n00:09:37.127 --> 00:09:39.904\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, [LAUGH], all right so\n\n193\n00:09:39.904 --> 00:09:43.800\nif I telnet in, we already\ntalked about this, I telnet out.\n\n194\n00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.533\nSyslog messages only go out to console so\nI'm going to type in terminal monitor.\n\n195\n00:09:47.533 --> 00:09:51.650\nNow I'm going to send this, this is\nhow I send it to the syslog server.\n\n196\n00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.350\nNow there's two commands.\n\n197\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.702\nSo you might see just logging to IP\naddress or logging host to the IP address,\n\n198\n00:09:57.702 --> 00:09:58.458\nsame thing.\n\n199\n00:09:58.458 --> 00:10:01.624\nNow I'm gonna say, in this case here,\nI am going to change it to informational.\n\n200\n00:10:01.624 --> 00:10:05.537\nSo what am I sending here if i say,\nlogging trap informational here guys?\n\n201\n00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:11.395\nEvery awesome Cisco engineer\nwill eat ice cream daily.\n\n202\n00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:15.900\nSo this one's actually kinda\neasy cuz it's level 7 out of 8.\n\n203\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.470\nSo the only word not\nsitting there is debugging.\n\n204\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.142\n>> Right?\nSo this one's kinda easy if you\n\n205\n00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:20.766\nget that one.\n\n206\n00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:24.764\nAll right, now in this case here,\nnow that we have our NTP set,\n\n207\n00:10:24.764 --> 00:10:27.770\nservice timestamps log datetime msec.\n\n208\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.110\nAnd then if you do debugging,\nwe wanna timestamp those as well, right?\n\n209\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.590\nI highly recommend turning these on,\nand they're an objective.\n\n210\n00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.990\nFor some basic testing,\nvery important new in the objectives here,\n\n211\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.320\nnow ping is not new for\nanybody or anything, right?\n\n212\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.790\nBut extended ping,\na lot of us probably use it.\n\n213\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.090\nLet's go out and take a look at it and\n\n214\n00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.710\nsee how we can use extended ping to help\nus troubleshoot routing issues, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.989\nSo lets run out and do that.\n\n216\n00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.062\nI'm gonna try to go out there and do that.\n\n217\n00:10:58.062 --> 00:11:03.950\nSo I'm gonna come up here to LA and\nI'm gonna ping corp.\n\n218\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:11.050\n172.16.10.5 because I'm 10.6.\n\n219\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.283\nAll right, so great, ping works great.\n\n220\n00:11:14.283 --> 00:11:15.830\nIt's an easy way to tell us.\n\n221\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.770\nUses ICNP echo request and echo replies.\n\n222\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.850\nBut I can do this, guys.\n\n223\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.370\nCheck this out.\n\n224\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.323\nPing, gonna make this bigger, and\nI can change the protocol to IPv6.\n\n225\n00:11:25.323 --> 00:11:27.570\nThose are the two we used today.\n\n226\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.280\nTarget IP address: 172.16.10.5.\n\n227\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.114\nSame one, but wait.\n\n228\n00:11:34.114 --> 00:11:36.561\nI'm gonna use this a little\nbit differently and\n\n229\n00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:38.870\nhave it use a different source address.\n\n230\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.520\nThat way it goes through my router and\nhas to be routed.\n\n231\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.670\nBecause if I just use ping, it's going to\nuse the closes interface to that device.\n\n232\n00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.620\nWell, I'm gonna to say no, I wanna\nuse another interface on the backside\n\n233\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.980\nof my router to make it\ngo through the router.\n\n234\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.410\nRight, that's one of the reasons\nI'd use extended ping.\n\n235\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.985\nThe other reason, let's take a look here\nI can change my repeat count to like\n\n236\n00:11:56.985 --> 00:11:59.485\n5,000 or something like that,\nin this case I'll just make it 10.\n\n237\n00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:03.300\nBut if I set it to 50,000 and\nthen it doesn't work,\n\n238\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.350\nyou're gonna be sitting here a while.\n\n239\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.890\nNow the other thing is that I do, is I\nchange the datagram size to test the MTU.\n\n240\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.600\nSo I might do it at like 3,000 or\nsomething like that if my MTU is 1,500 to\n\n241\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.550\nsee what happens when I'm fragmenting,\nand what type of delay that I'm getting.\n\n242\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.320\nThis is a really good thing to do here,\nto test your link.\n\n243\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.780\nThe time out extended commands\nis what we really want here, and\n\n244\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.110\nthen the first thing that comes\nup is my source interface.\n\n245\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.210\nSo I'm actually gonna say loop back zero.\n\n246\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.280\nI wanna use my loop back interface server.\n\n247\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.135\nOops, I guess I needed to\ntype out the whole thing.\n\n248\n00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:33.300\nNow, I didn't do a no domain IP lookup.\n\n249\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.030\nRonnie, what are we doing here?\n\n250\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.059\nDo you guys see why I do that,\nthe very first thing when I type in?\n\n251\n00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:41.830\nThere we go.\n\n252\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.310\nNow type of service.\n\n253\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.590\nSo this is kind of annoying here,\nyou have to type out your actual.\n\n254\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.064\nSo if it was gigabyte ethernet or\n10 gigabyte ethernet,\n\n255\n00:12:49.064 --> 00:12:51.240\nyou have to type out the full\nthing right in there.\n\n256\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.770\nOkay, type of service.\n\n257\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.200\nDon't fragment that you\nprobably wanna leave that to no\n\n258\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.960\nif you're making a large MTU,\nbecause then it wouldn't fragment.\n\n259\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.020\nThen it wouldn't even work, right?\n\n260\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.003\nSo we wanna leave that as no.\n\n261\n00:13:03.003 --> 00:13:06.640\nAnd then the pattern, and\nwe can do it as verbose.\n\n262\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.697\nAnd I'm just gonna let it go.\n\n263\n00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:08.817\nAnd it's not working.\n\n264\n00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:12.353\nI just pinged 172.16.10.5.\n\n265\n00:13:12.353 --> 00:13:16.670\nSo I can ping it directly but when I'm\ngoing through my router, it didn't work.\n\n266\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.430\nThis indicates a router issue,\nI mean a routing protocol or\n\n267\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.470\na routing issue, right?\n\n268\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.220\nSo I'm gonna look at my routing table,\nright?\n\n269\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.000\nNow I know we haven't got to IP routing\nyet, but this is why I would do this.\n\n270\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.610\nI would go into my routing table and see\nso I'll jump ahead here, show IP route.\n\n271\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.780\nAnd let's see what I've got here.\n\n272\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.430\nSo where is my loop back zero?\n\n273\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:37.950\nI don't see it.\n\n274\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.644\nDo you see it?\n\n275\n00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:41.578\nThat might be an issue, right?\n\n276\n00:13:41.578 --> 00:13:42.860\nThere it is right there.\n\n277\n00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.000\nSo it says it's connected, it's 30.\n\n278\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.950\nSo it is in my routing table.\n\n279\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.107\nLet's see if I can ping it.\n\n280\n00:13:49.107 --> 00:13:53.932\n192.168.30.1 okay?\n\n281\n00:13:53.932 --> 00:13:57.410\nI can ping the directly connected\ninterfaces, but I'm not routing.\n\n282\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.540\nSo I'm gonna look at my routing\nprotocols at this point, or\n\n283\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.270\nmy static route if I was doing that.\n\n284\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.830\nAgain jumping ahead here, I can tell you\nwhat the problem was cuz I created it.\n\n285\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.410\nAnd I'm just using rip right now,\n\n286\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.990\nand I didn't have the network\nstatement in there.\n\n287\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.950\nOkay, we would troubleshoot that.\n\n288\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.900\nWe haven't got to routing protocols so\nI'm not gonna sit here and\n\n289\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.400\ntroubleshoot this with you right now.\n\n290\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.860\nBut that's what the problem was,\nI didn't have that in there.\n\n291\n00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.200\nBut this told me by pinging\nfrom an external or\n\n292\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.720\ndifferent interface source interface\nthat's one of the things that\n\n293\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.660\nthe loopback allows me to do,\nis test my routing.\n\n294\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.280\nThat's one of the things, right?\n\n295\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.443\nSo now if come back in here and\ntry it again,\n\n296\n00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:43.929\n172.16.10.5, p count's fine,\nall of this is fine.\n\n297\n00:14:43.929 --> 00:14:47.557\nI'm just going to add the extended\ncommands of my interface and\n\n298\n00:14:47.557 --> 00:14:51.940\nthen just jam through the rest of these,\nand bam, that worked.\n\n299\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.990\nSo, that told me I had it routed.\n\n300\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.707\nSo this is a really great thing about\nextended ping and I can do the same thing\n\n301\n00:14:57.707 --> 00:15:01.260\nwith traceroute using extended\ntraceroute and also change my source.\n\n302\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.740\nSo, very cool thing guys, extended ping.\n\n303\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.120\nAll right, and we could've done debugging.\n\n304\n00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:13.190\nWe could've done debug ip icmp down\nhere and watched watch my pings occur.\n\n305\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:18.970\nSo do that in your lab, that extended ping\nis an objective and changing the source\n\n306\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.530\nis an objective and I just showed you why\nyou would do that and why it's a source.\n\n307\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.910\nSo that's probably something that'll come\nup in the troubleshooting section on\n\n308\n00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.920\nthe objectives.\n\n309\n00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.510\nAll right, traceroute, same thing.\n\n310\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.180\nTrace will show us the path\na packet takes through the network,\n\n311\n00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.210\ncuz ping just tells if the host is alive.\n\n312\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.840\nIt also told me I had a routing issue in\nthis case, but ping tells me it's alive,\n\n313\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.330\ntraceroute shows me the path a packet\ntakes to get to that host, right?\n\n314\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.202\nIt uses the time-to-live field, so\nit sets the time-to-live to one, right?\n\n315\n00:15:45.202 --> 00:15:50.626\nYour packet goes out, the time-to-live\nexpires, and basically the device,\n\n316\n00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:55.584\nthe router, sends an ICMP a error\nmessage saying, hey your packet died.\n\n317\n00:15:55.584 --> 00:15:56.982\nDo you wanna know where the body is?\n\n318\n00:15:56.982 --> 00:15:57.920\nHere's the address.\n\n319\n00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.464\nThat's pretty much how Trace works.\n\n320\n00:15:59.464 --> 00:16:00.134\nTraceroute works.\n\n321\n00:16:00.134 --> 00:16:03.675\nThen we set it to 2, go one hop,\ntwo hops, Packett kills himself and\n\n322\n00:16:03.675 --> 00:16:05.950\nsomeone tells us where the body is, right?\n\n323\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.460\nThat's Traceroute in a nutshell.\n\n324\n00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.760\nKind of a twisted little way of looking\nat it, but it's true, all right.\n\n325\n00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.163\nBasic IP troubleshooting here.\n\n326\n00:16:15.163 --> 00:16:16.100\nWhich question?\n\n327\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.770\nLet me see.\nEvery as good as you will need ice cubes.\n\n328\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.633\nDid you put that out there?\n\n329\n00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:20.290\nGido did that.\n\n330\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.190\n>> Yup.\n>> Guide.\n\n331\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.760\nYes, you absolutely need TCP with NTP,\nas well.\n\n332\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.810\nIt definitely uses NTP on the inside,\nbut I use it for both as well.\n\n333\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.950\nSo if we mention that.\n\n334\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.430\nNow, let's take a look\nat some basic trouble.\n\n335\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.080\nThis is like the network plus\napproach to troubleshooting here.\n\n336\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.093\nPing, now, this is the whole thing when\nwe were talking about IP addresses,\n\n337\n00:16:42.093 --> 00:16:43.904\nthey reserve the 127 address.\n\n338\n00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:49.120\nAnd everyone's like,\nyou have to Ping 001, that's not true.\n\n339\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.450\nPing, or you can Ping 127\n[INAUDIBLE] all the way out, right?\n\n340\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.470\nThat's 16 million addresses wasted,\njust to test our IP stack.\n\n341\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:04.720\nI think this stopped happening\nwhen we got to Vista,\n\n342\n00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.950\nbut when we had XP and Windows 98 and\nso on, I had bad IP stacks all the time,\n\n343\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.420\nI had to reinstall all the time, so\nthis was a very helpful command.\n\n344\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.710\nWhen was the last time you had a bad\nIP stack, can you even remember?\n\n345\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.240\n>> I don't remember.\n\n346\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.778\n>> No, that was many beers ago.\n\n347\n00:17:15.778 --> 00:17:18.295\n[LAUGH] Bad IP stack.\n\n348\n00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:19.618\nIt's the first thing\nI'm gonna check though.\n\n349\n00:17:19.618 --> 00:17:21.951\nSo, it's pretty rare that I'm\ngonna ask someone to do this.\n\n350\n00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:25.550\nSo Sally calls up and says,\nI can't login to the sales server.\n\n351\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.320\nAll right, typical kind of help desk.\n\n352\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.940\nI was talking to Quest,\nI had a problem down with Denver,\n\n353\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.020\nand I tracked it down and I actually knew\nwhat the problem was with the router down\n\n354\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.450\nin Denver, because by using tracer,\nI can result names and so on.\n\n355\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.590\nSo I call up and I go through this whole\nthing of everything that I've done and\n\n356\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.120\nwhere the problem is, what router,\nwhat port it was and all this other stuff.\n\n357\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.435\nShe goes, well I'm gonna have you,\nlet's start with something and\n\n358\n00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.652\nthen I'll escalate your ticket.\n\n359\n00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:53.500\nOpen up a DOS prompt and Pinging 127,\nand she started doing this.\n\n360\n00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.528\nIf I could have got through that phone.\n\n361\n00:17:55.528 --> 00:17:57.411\n[LAUGH]\n>> Neck.\n\n362\n00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:59.069\nIt was like, really?\n\n363\n00:17:59.069 --> 00:18:01.298\nI just went through ten minutes of\ntelling you where the delay is running.\n\n364\n00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:04.188\nSo I kept calling, and the manager calls\nme back and says, if you call again,\n\n365\n00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:05.978\nwe're just going to\ndisconnect your service.\n\n366\n00:18:05.978 --> 00:18:08.137\nWhat kind of service is that today?\n\n367\n00:18:08.137 --> 00:18:08.776\n>> Unusual.\n\n368\n00:18:08.776 --> 00:18:09.310\n>> Yeah.\n\n369\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.914\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n370\n00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:16.949\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways, Ping 127.0.0.1, bad IP stack.\n\n371\n00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:20.440\nNow, you're going to\nping your own IP address.\n\n372\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.270\nThis is going to tell you you're\ntalking to your land driver, and\n\n373\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.900\nhow do you do that?\n\n374\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.640\nYou have Sally type in IP config, right?\n\n375\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.760\nOr, ifconfig.\n\n376\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.740\nAnd then you're gonna ping\nyour default gateway.\n\n377\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.469\nThis tells you what kind of.\n\n378\n00:18:31.469 --> 00:18:32.820\nDoes Sally have a problem with the PC?\n\n379\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.470\nProbably not at this point, right?\n\n380\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.738\nThen if you can ping the remote server,\nbut be careful here,\n\n381\n00:18:36.738 --> 00:18:39.184\nbecause you're gonna say,\nyou can ping the remote server,\n\n382\n00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:41.540\nit's not a network problem,\nclick, hang up, right?\n\n383\n00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.770\nThat's a typical response.\n\n384\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.590\nDon't be know as Mr. Ping.\n\n385\n00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.766\nI've gone to some places,\nthen just call these people Mr.\n\n386\n00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:47.430\nPings, I can Ping it, it's fine.\n\n387\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.340\nNot true.\n\n388\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:48.860\nRight.\n\n389\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.930\nSo let me ask you a question.\n\n390\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.750\nLet's go a little bit further.\n\n391\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.362\nSo we're going to do all this and\nfigure out if we have a problem locally,\n\n392\n00:18:55.362 --> 00:18:58.650\nit's gonna tell us we have up to\na network layer issue later right.\n\n393\n00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.280\nBut check this out.\n\n394\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.260\nWe might want to go a little bit further.\n\n395\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.010\nWe want to go up here.\n\n396\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.310\nSo we have our commands we've\ngone to the last couple of days.\n\n397\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.430\nShow IP interface brief,\nI don't have show protocols on here,\n\n398\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.248\nthis is a really good command,\nshow proto, right?\n\n399\n00:19:10.248 --> 00:19:13.070\nThis is gonna show us my IP,\nIPP6 addresses on there,\n\n400\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.540\nthis is gonna show me my interfaces,\nI really like show protocols.\n\n401\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.630\nShow IP interface brief, these two\ncommands here, and then the other one that\n\n402\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.416\nwe did yesterday was show,\nI don't have this on here either.\n\n403\n00:19:22.416 --> 00:19:25.722\nShow IP interface E0 whatever.\n\n404\n00:19:25.722 --> 00:19:27.810\nAnd this is gonna give\nme the IP information.\n\n405\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.115\nFor example, we had fast switching,\nand access list and stuff like that.\n\n406\n00:19:32.115 --> 00:19:34.064\nThese three code commands are objectives,\n\n407\n00:19:34.064 --> 00:19:36.565\nand they're the ones that\nI kind of use everyday.\n\n408\n00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:39.777\nMy defacto one that I go to\nwhenever I have a problem is\n\n409\n00:19:39.777 --> 00:19:42.335\nshow IP interface brief without a doubt.\n\n410\n00:19:42.335 --> 00:19:44.525\nShow protocols gives me my mask.\n\n411\n00:19:44.525 --> 00:19:45.665\nThat's what I like about it.\n\n412\n00:19:45.665 --> 00:19:48.065\nShow interface, show cdp neighbors.\n\n413\n00:19:48.065 --> 00:19:50.595\nSh lldp neighbors.\n\n414\n00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:52.835\nPing trace and show ip route.\n\n415\n00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:56.155\nThat gives me my physical daily network\nlayer so I know I'm doing pretty well.\n\n416\n00:19:56.155 --> 00:19:59.395\nThe show ip route because my routing\ntable, I can look for things in there.\n\n417\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.720\nHowever, if I tell Sally now,\nopen a browser and\n\n418\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.390\ntype in this IP address which is\nthe IP address of the server, and\n\n419\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.110\nthen she gets a connection,\ndo we have a network problem?\n\n420\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.890\nNo way.\n\n421\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.300\nWe just went from layer 7 of\nSally's PC to layer 7 of the server.\n\n422\n00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.320\nNow you can, without a shadow of a doubt,\n\n423\n00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.620\nknow that you don't\nhave a network problem.\n\n424\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.190\nWhat's the problem?\n\n425\n00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.330\nA Microsoft probably\nname resolution issue.\n\n426\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.290\nRight?\nYou can\n\n427\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.020\nget through the IP address and so on.\n\n428\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.520\nAll right, so that's a really good way to\ndo what we want to go to the top here.\n\n429\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.235\nAll right, now let's go through a couple\ntroubleshooting things real quick.\n\n430\n00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:35.820\nWhy could S00 be up,down?\n\n431\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.750\nWell, that's a kind of\na silly question here,\n\n432\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.540\nguys, because it could be\na thousand things over here.\n\n433\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.194\nSomeone, like someone could\nhave stolen the router.\n\n434\n00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:44.217\nThis happened to me before.\n\n435\n00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:46.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In Miami, where else, right?\n\n436\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.130\nAnyways, [LAUGH] so I can see that I'm up,\nbut let's take a look here.\n\n437\n00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.400\nThere's our clue right there.\n\n438\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:55.410\nUp, down.\n\n439\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.710\nLet me move that over here.\n\n440\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.350\nUp, down.\nSo my serial is up, down.\n\n441\n00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.900\nBut wait, this gives me a couple things.\n\n442\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.040\nDo I have a local problem on my router?\n\n443\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.050\nWell, not physical,\na data link at this point.\n\n444\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:07.600\nRight?\n\n445\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.180\nNot physical.\n\n446\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.380\nThis is my physical.\n\n447\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.000\nSo the first thing is\nif this is a question,\n\n448\n00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.570\nI don't know what the right answer is.\n\n449\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.760\nI can tell you what all\nthe wrong answers are, though.\n\n450\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.322\nBecause if it's anything here,\nif they say something like,\n\n451\n00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:26.110\nbad cable NS00, bad interface on r1S00,\nthat's the issue.\n\n452\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.050\nThose are all wrong answers.\n\n453\n00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.170\nThat's not the problem\nbecause I have an up here.\n\n454\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.370\nSo in this case here, and typically\nthe way you approach the exam is,\n\n455\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.060\ndon't look for the right answer,\nalways just eliminate the wrong answers.\n\n456\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.650\nAnd how do you do that?\n\n457\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.340\nBy building a great foundation.\n\n458\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.750\nNow, in this case here,\nwhat could be the problem over here?\n\n459\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.470\nWell, whatever is left.\n\n460\n00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.720\nAnd they could have a bad cable,\nbad encapsulation.\n\n461\n00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.260\nWe could have PVP on one side HTLC\non another, something like that.\n\n462\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.080\nThey could be shut down.\n\n463\n00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080\nThe router is gone.\n\n464\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.130\nAnything.\nThe ISP is down.\n\n465\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.480\nThere could be a thousand things.\n\n466\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.480\nThe things that I can do is\neliminate what's not wrong.\n\n467\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.760\nAll right?\nThat's how you approach this.\n\n468\n00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.760\nOne more thing, licensing.\n\n469\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.760\nVery, very important.\n\n470\n00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.560\nIt is kind of an object, and I'm gonna\ngo through a couple commands on you, and\n\n471\n00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.250\nthen we'll be done here.\n\n472\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.400\nJust one minute.\n\n473\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.330\nSo hang in there.\n\n474\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.750\nOkay, so first off, we have\nCisco License Manager, I'm telling you,\n\n475\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.890\ntheir licences have gotten really\nconvoluted, it used to be a lot easier.\n\n476\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.003\nActually used to be able to just\ngo to Cisco and go download it.\n\n477\n00:22:14.003 --> 00:22:15.337\n[LAUGH] But, those days are over.\n\n478\n00:22:15.337 --> 00:22:16.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyways,\n\n479\n00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.110\n>> So you can go to the licence portal,\n\n480\n00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.540\nit's what cisco.com/go/licence, right?\n\n481\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.280\nAnd then you get your pack and you put\nthat in and it gives you a licence and\n\n482\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.250\nyou can install it.\n\n483\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.360\nIt takes some effort and actually if you\nhave hundreds or thousands of devices,\n\n484\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.480\nyou almost need someone full time doing\nthat, plus your, what's it, support.\n\n485\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.789\nMy god, tack right, not tack,\nbut the support on it.\n\n486\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.930\nI'm telling you it's a lot of work,\nbecause if those expire,\n\n487\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.795\nthe support expires, it's and\nI'm saying that in a very nice way.\n\n488\n00:22:44.795 --> 00:22:48.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Licensing features,\n\n489\n00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.450\nsince the introduction of 15.0,\nour life's been hell with this,\n\n490\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.660\nbut there is one kind of cool thing,\nlike, and I showed you yesterday.\n\n491\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.150\nSo if we run out here, and I did this, and\n\n492\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:05.210\nshow flash and notice I'm in user mode,\nuseless mode here.\n\n493\n00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.740\nAnd I have, this one's advanced security,\nthat's not where I want to be.\n\n494\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.280\nI don't have as good of an iOS on that for\na reason.\n\n495\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.920\nShow flash up here,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n496\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.620\n>> In this case,\nhere is this 15.1 Advanced Enterprise.\n\n497\n00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.240\nNow, this is going to include\neverything that's in there.\n\n498\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.810\nSo, basically, I have one iOS, and\n\n499\n00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.620\nit has all the features in there and\nthen I can just enable or disable them.\n\n500\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.590\nSo before when I had to change iOS's,\nwhen I wanted a different feature,\n\n501\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:39.830\nthen in this case here I just download the\niOS that has every feature in it now and\n\n502\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.665\nnow I just license what I want.\n\n503\n00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:44.130\nSo we're gonna talk about that and\n\n504\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.767\nhow you can do it without licensing\neverything that you want.\n\n505\n00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:52.418\nAll right, so we can enable or\ndisable individual features\n\n506\n00:23:52.418 --> 00:23:57.286\nwith license keys without\nhaving to change my iOS.\n\n507\n00:23:57.286 --> 00:24:00.141\nThat's one of the great\nthings about the 15 code, but\n\n508\n00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:01.852\nthe licensing's kind of a pain.\n\n509\n00:24:01.852 --> 00:24:04.471\nSo there was kind of\ndifferent technology bases.\n\n510\n00:24:04.471 --> 00:24:06.460\nIt comes with the IP base, right?\n\n511\n00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.590\nThat's your initial,\ncomes with your device.\n\n512\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.710\nThey have an IP base.\n\n513\n00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.830\nBut we can buy data,\nunified communications or security.\n\n514\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.220\nThose are the four ones you need\nto know for the objectives.\n\n515\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.570\nI can do a show license and\nsee what I have.\n\n516\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.080\nIn this case here it's gonna tell me,\nhere's my IP base.\n\n517\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.750\nThat's permanent, it's active.\n\n518\n00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.010\nAnd then here's a security, and\n\n519\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.030\nwe'll just keep going down and\nseeing all the features.\n\n520\n00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.390\nAnd this says it's not activated.\n\n521\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.190\nSo when we say, I need security,\nlet's activate that one.\n\n522\n00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.440\nOkay?\nJust need a credit card.\n\n523\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.370\nAll right, to install.\n\n524\n00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.890\nSo once I decide I want a feature to\ninstall, and please remember these for\n\n525\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.450\nthe objectives, we're paying attention,\nlicense install.\n\n526\n00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.370\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n527\n00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.940\nwe're going to put that in Flash and\nthen install it.\n\n528\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.860\nIt's an XML file that you'll get.\n\n529\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.590\nSo we're gonna use the license install for\npermanent install.\n\n530\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.700\nThat's pretty easy.\n\n531\n00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.400\nNow hold on, there's an evaluation\nlicense that you can use over and\n\n532\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.840\nover and over again.\n\n533\n00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.350\nRight.\n\n534\n00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.590\nSo this is what, if you're at home,\nthat's what it's for.\n\n535\n00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.590\nRight.\nIf you've got a demo, a pod, and\n\n536\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.050\nyou're using it for studying.\n\n537\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.760\nIt's fine.\n\n538\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.680\nWe use that license boot module command.\n\n539\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.340\nLicense boot module command, right.\n\n540\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.940\nAnd this will allow us to\ndo an evaluation license.\n\n541\n00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.900\nOkay to back up the license\nwhich you absolutely want to do.\n\n542\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.000\nIn this case here license save flash.\n\n543\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.260\nThey could easily ask you\nthese on the objectives.\n\n544\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.800\nHow do install permanent how\ndo you install temporary.\n\n545\n00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.300\nHow do you save it.\n\n546\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.130\nSo it's licensed,\nsay we're gonna save it to flash, and\n\n547\n00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.280\njust name it whatever you want.\n\n548\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.570\nIn this case, I named it after me, okay?\n\n549\n00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.690\nNow I can disable the package,\nnotice here it's disabled, and\n\n550\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.480\nthen I can license clear.\n\n551\n00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.980\nSo I can take those out if I wanted to,\nif they were about to expire or\n\n552\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.940\nsomething like that,\nI might want to remove them.\n\n553\n00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.350\nSo I can put in another one.\n\n554\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:51.170\nOkay, so in this case here no license boot\nmodule so I'm going to disable it and\n\n555\n00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.510\nthen I'm going to, disable it,\nand then take it out.\n\n556\n00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.860\nSo here's an example of that,\nno license boot module, okay.\n\n557\n00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.960\nVery, very important,\nwe are at the end of this chapter 7.\n\n558\n00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.150\nSo in my new CCENT book which is\non Amazon right now, go out and\n\n559\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.960\nwe can go through chapters 1 through 7.\n\n560\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.090\nGo through the review questions and\nthe written labs.\n\n561\n00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.490\nThere are some powerful questions\nin there, great written labs,\n\n562\n00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.690\non lammle.com you're also doing the next\ntest bank managing a Cisco internet work.\n\n563\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.120\nSo we've done quite a few test\nbanks on lammle.com so far.\n\n564\n00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.540\nDon't stop now.\n\n565\n00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.330\n>> All right Todd.\n\n566\n00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.840\nWell thank you again for being here.\n\n567\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.400\nRemember what we also took\na look at in this episode.\n\n568\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.570\nIs some of the different features that we\nwould have to do if we were managing of\n\n569\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.170\ncourse Cisco IOS to help us out here.\n\n570\n00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.200\nAnd that actually included of course\nunderstanding how to implement things like\n\n571\n00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.050\nNTP for our servers to be able to get\nthe proper timing that we need to.\n\n572\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:46.350\nAnd usually that's the basis of course as\nwe actually move into the world of syslog.\n\n573\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.120\nAnd syslog gives us the details and the\ninformation that we want coming from our\n\n574\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.170\nrouters so\nthat we can also troubleshoot better.\n\n575\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.850\nDo pay attention, make sure you spend\ntime in learning the eight different\n\n576\n00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.830\nmessage levels that are out there And\nyou will need those.\n\n577\n00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.360\nAnd so you want to make sure\nyou pay attention to that.\n\n578\n00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.872\nAnd it's [CROSSTALK] every\nawesome Cisco engineer.\n\n579\n00:27:05.872 --> 00:27:08.085\n>> It's on there.\nYou don't put it out there.\n\n580\n00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:10.100\n>> Will need ice cream daily.\n\n581\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.070\n>> Every awesome Cisco engineer\nwill need ice cream daily.\n\n582\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.270\nThank you.\n\n583\n00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's a good one.\n\n584\n00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.140\n>> So yeah, we want to make sure we\nremember that because that's actually\n\n585\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.440\ngonna be very important as\nwe continue on in the exam.\n\n586\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.590\nWe also took a look at a bit,\njust briefly here, of course.\n\n587\n00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.270\nAnd the importance of using\nthe extended ping and\n\n588\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.780\nhow that helps us in troubleshooting.\n\n589\n00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.010\nOf course, a few issues, but\n\n590\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.500\nrouting especially in\nthe case that Todd showed us.\n\n591\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.150\nAnd then, of course, traceroute is\none of those foundations, as well.\n\n592\n00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.350\nNow, included along with that,\nof course, in the troubleshooting part,\n\n593\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.890\nis the basic method of troubleshooting,\nalong with using those show commands.\n\n594\n00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.980\nIf you haven't been using show commands,\nwell, on the ICND1,\n\n595\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.430\nyou better get ready for it.\n\n596\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.160\nYou'll probably, actually,\nhave to use different show commands\n\n597\n00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.260\nThat get you the results so that you can\nsee whatever the problem is gonna be.\n\n598\n00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.570\nThey're not gonna give us the fix-all\nright, my run to is always, show run,\n\n599\n00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.280\nand then I think I know what\neverything is gonna be.\n\n600\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.250\nBut you have to actually make sure you\nrun through those different ones as well.\n\n601\n00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.260\nAnd then of course,\nspend a little bit of time in licensing.\n\n602\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.460\nUnderstanding the concept\nis not that difficult,\n\n603\n00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.600\nbut it does seem like\na foreign beast to most of us.\n\n604\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.970\nSo, instead,\nmake sure you actually get those ready for\n\n605\n00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.560\nsome easy points on the exam as well.\n\n606\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.030\nSo don't overlook anything that\nwe've talked about here with Todd.\n\n607\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.010\nMake sure you go over them again.\n\n608\n00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.060\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to, again, end this episode.\n\n609\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.720\nSo, we're going to sign off here.\n\n610\n00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.520\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n611\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.000\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n612\n00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.690\n>> All right.\n\n613\n00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:34.410\nI'm Todd Lamley.\n\n614\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.640\n>> And we'll see you next time

00:00:16.820\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.020\ntoday we're taking a look at ICND1\ncontent, getting ready for the exam.\n\n5\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900\nAnd who better to help\nus to do that than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.230\nTodd Lammle as he's back\nhere in the studios.\n\n7\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.850\nThank you for being here with us today.\n\n8\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.290\n>> All right, Ronnie, thank you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.680\nHey, now that we've got some\nfoundation under our belt,\n\n10\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.940\nassuming you guys watched the earlier\nepisodes, we are strong in our networking.\n\n11\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.550\nWe are strong in our subname.\n\n12\n00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.170\nWe are strong in VLSM summarization.\n\n13\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.610\nWe are ready to move forward let's\nstart configuring some Cisco's IOS.\n\n14\n00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.230\nSo let's dive right into\nthe objectives guys.\n\n15\n00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.954\nFirst off, let's take a look here,\n\n16\n00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:54.540\nI've got 2960 squared 3560 switch,\nsomething like that.\n\n17\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.110\nNow I don't know if I'd\nuse that in production.\n\n18\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.510\nBut this is great for a home lab, right?\n\n19\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.840\nSo a 3560 that looks like this\nwould be something you would buy.\n\n20\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.900\nA little eight port switch here that\nyou could do layer three, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.520\nSo a little enterprise for the little\nhome enterprise networking, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.270\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n23\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.190\nSo on here over here,\nI have my gigabit up, either uplink.\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.110\nI have either fiber or twisted pair here.\n\n25\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.210\nI have eight ports.\n\n26\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.170\nNow one of the things I wanna keep on eye\non here is we have the SYST light here,\n\n27\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.590\non our switches, right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.230\nKinda probably hard to see a little bit,\nthere we go, maybe that'll help.\n\n29\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.970\nThe SYST light, now when we boot\nup the switch, which by the way,\n\n30\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.050\nhow do you boot it?\n\n31\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.170\nYou plug it in with a cable.\n\n32\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.872\nThere's no switch on the switch, actually.\n\n33\n00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:38.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, anyways, plug it in and\n\n34\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.230\nthen the post test will run if,\nand this will be amber.\n\n35\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.535\nAnd after a minute or so\nthis will come up and turn green.\n\n36\n00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:46.710\nOkay, now the same thing\nwith these ports over here.\n\n37\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.290\nOn a switch this starts at let's say\neither gig zero zero or F zero zero or\n\n38\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.810\nwhatever, but it doesn't start\nat zero zero like a router,\n\n39\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.110\nit actually starts at like gig zero one or\nF zero one, right?\n\n40\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.370\nSo, we don't have the gig zero zero for\nthat on the switches.\n\n41\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.450\nThey start at port one, remember that.\n\n42\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.820\nNow, on this case here,\nwe see that we have our ports and\n\n43\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.860\nthere's a little light right here.\n\n44\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.910\nSo this will turn green after\nyou plug something in and\n\n45\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.530\nyou can even normal operation and\nthat's great.\n\n46\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.995\nBut, for about a minute,\nI've got a question for Ronnie now again.\n\n47\n00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:21.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I plug a cable in and\n\n48\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.200\nthe port goes amber for about a minute.\n\n49\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.300\nLike I'm not passing data.\n\n50\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.890\nIt's just amber and then it turns green.\n\n51\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.300\nAnd we start seeing blinking,\nindicating normal operation.\n\n52\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.400\nWhat's with the amber for about a minute?\n\n53\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.730\n>> Well it's actually going through the\nprocess of making sure that everything is\n\n54\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.960\nready for spanning tree and\neverything else.\n\n55\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.670\n>> Okay, the answer was spanning tree.\n\n56\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.035\nHe got to the answer at the end there.\n\n57\n00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So a lot of people kind of ask,\n\n58\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.938\nwell what is auto negotiation?\n\n59\n00:02:43.938 --> 00:02:48.600\n10, 100, 1,000 duplex, now that's kind\nof in microseconds, that's pretty fast.\n\n60\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.040\nIt really is spanning tree,\nright, so spanning tree,\n\n61\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.950\nand we're gonna get to that, probably\nSaturday I'm looking at, but anyways.\n\n62\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.430\nSo this is going to turn green\nwhen you plug something in.\n\n63\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.130\nIt doesn't pass data for almost a minute,\nby default on all Cisco IOS switches.\n\n64\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.850\nAll right, now but we can fix that.\n\n65\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.580\nStick around for later episodes.\n\n66\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.280\nNow lets talk about a router here for\na second.\n\n67\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.350\nThe one thing I don't\nsee here on the switch,\n\n68\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.560\nhere's my console port right here,\nwe don't have auxiliary ports on this.\n\n69\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.240\nSome switches we do, but\nlet's talk about the differences here.\n\n70\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.950\nSo first off I see over here\nwhere we can add cards, right?\n\n71\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.130\nWe probably could add\na couple more land ports.\n\n72\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.220\nThey don't let you add\na lot of land ports,\n\n73\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.320\nbecause you'll oversubscribe\nthe back plain.\n\n74\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.520\nBut, we could put some\nWAN serial cards in here,\n\n75\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.950\ndoubtful we'll do that today, some void\ncards typically, something like that.\n\n76\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.150\nOver here you'll see we have\na console port and auxiliary port and\n\n77\n00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.879\nwhat's the difference between\na console and auxiliary?\n\n78\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.870\n>> The console port is for\nthe blue console cable, and\n\n79\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.290\nthe auxiliary is if you were\ndoing a modem type of connection.\n\n80\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.550\n>> So if it's not blue, I can't use it.\n\n81\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.255\n>> True.\n>> Okay, got it.\n\n82\n00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:50.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It has to be blue.\n\n83\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.180\nWhich is a, what, a crossover?\n\n84\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.240\n>> It is a rolled cable.\n\n85\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.690\n>> Rolled cable,\nrolled cable, that's right.\n\n86\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.410\nThe auxiliary port is exactly\nthe same thing as console papal.\n\n87\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.060\nThe console lets me get in,\ncan figure it out of band.\n\n88\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.110\nThe auxiliary allows me to\nhook a modem up to it so\n\n89\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.480\nI can dial up to what, 115K, kilobits\nper second, dial into that modem so\n\n90\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.650\nthat allows me to get an out of band\nconnection at a remote location right?\n\n91\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.480\nBecause I might wanna drive there.\n\n92\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.420\nNotice I have some gigabits\nethernets over here and this starts,\n\n93\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.060\nthis says Gig 0/0 if you can see that.\n\n94\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.060\nThat says Gig 0/0 and Gig 0/1 over there.\n\n95\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.050\nSo I have two built in ethernets on this\nguy, and then we have the console which\n\n96\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.200\nis the USB over here as well, so\nright here, remember that mini USB here.\n\n97\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.930\nThis guy right here is not used right now.\n\n98\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.310\nSo this is a 1921, and\nright now I forgot to tell you\n\n99\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.090\nwe're running IOS code 15.2, all right?\n\n100\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.520\nThat's where we're at today.\n\n101\n00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.390\nSo what's the difference between 12.3,\n12.4 and 15?\n\n102\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.800\nNothing, really.\n\n103\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.780\nThe licensing.\n\n104\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.730\nThe license gets more convoluted.\n\n105\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.510\nNot really a huge other\namount of differences.\n\n106\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.720\nAll right so if you've got routers and\nswitches at home, running 12.4 Enterprise,\n\n107\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.420\nyou're fine for the season.\n\n108\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.280\nYou can't run through the licensing\ncommands, but so what.\n\n109\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.850\nThere are two main EXEC modes for\nentering into a router or switch.\n\n110\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.270\nSo, the first mode, I'm going to\nconnect into the console, right,\n\n111\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.090\nwith my blue cable here.\n\n112\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.880\nI'm going to connect into that console,\nand how do I set that up, Ronnie?\n\n113\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.500\nWe talked, we kind of showed\nthat yesterday when I was\n\n114\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.010\ntalking about a console cable.\n\n115\n00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.810\nDo you remember those settings?\n\n116\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.900\n>> Yes.\nI used to call it the 8N1.\n\n117\n00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.160\nThe idea of the parity here.\n\n118\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.104\nWe have to do 9,600 baud I believe?\n\n119\n00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:33.718\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n120\n00:05:33.718 --> 00:05:36.755\nYep.\n>> And then eight bits.\n\n121\n00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:39.100\nAnd then, none.\n\n122\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.450\n>> None.\n>> And then one bit.\n\n123\n00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.390\n>> And no flow control.\n\n124\n00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.970\n>> And no flow control.\n\n125\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.060\n>> Yep, so\ntypically it just kind of comes up.\n\n126\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.550\nI use secure CRT.\n\n127\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.220\nPlug a cable in,\ntypically a USB cable today,\n\n128\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.510\nplug it in there and\nI can use this to connect into my console.\n\n129\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.500\nI'm gonna press enter and\nI'm gonna end up with a command prompt.\n\n130\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.990\nThis is called, what, user mode.\n\n131\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.120\nThat's right here.\n\n132\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.562\nUser mode, I usually refer to it for\na lot of times, as useless mode.\n\n133\n00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:06.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Because\n\n134\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.500\nwe really can't do anything, can we?\n\n135\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.960\nSo we can, what, view statistics.\n\n136\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.030\nNow, I can't view the configuration.\n\n137\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.580\nI can't change the configuration.\n\n138\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.240\nHowever, I know enough commands in here\nthat I can get the whole configuration.\n\n139\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.460\nNow, instead of being in Privileged Mode\nwhere I can type out all the commands,\n\n140\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.952\nI mean, type one command and see it all.\n\n141\n00:06:22.952 --> 00:06:25.160\nI can just type ten or 11 commands, and\n\n142\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.740\nget everything I need is just efforting,\nright?\n\n143\n00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.500\nWhy do all that effort ,when I can be\nhere and type just one command, right.\n\n144\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.290\nThe second mode and most commonly\nused is called the Enabled Mode.\n\n145\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.990\nSo, it's really referred\nto as Privileged Mode,\n\n146\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.270\nbut why don't we call it Enabled Mode,\nRonnie?\n\n147\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.290\n>> It gives us the ability to go\ninto well, I think Privileged Mode.\n\n148\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.030\n>> It does.\n\n149\n00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.800\nIt's the command.\n\n150\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.350\n>> It's the command.\n\n151\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.390\n>> It's the command to get there.\n\n152\n00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.090\nThat's what he was trying to say here.\n\n153\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.080\nNow this give us detailed\nexamination of switch or router.\n\n154\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.370\nEnables configuration and debugging.\n\n155\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.360\nWe can look at the config.\n\n156\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.110\nSo what's debugging?\n\n157\n00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.720\nThat's watching packets\nas they cross the CPU.\n\n158\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.979\nIt's very CPU intensive, so\nwe're being careful of that.\n\n159\n00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:04.260\nIt's a prerequisite for\ngetting into things like line commands,\n\n160\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.780\ninterface commands,\nsub interfaces, and so on, right?\n\n161\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.910\nAnd we'll notice we have a pound sign.\n\n162\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:09.720\nWe have a pound sign.\n\n163\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.810\nSo that gives us an indication by default,\nthat we're in Privileged Mode.\n\n164\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.060\nNow I used to screw with my\nfriends at work, because I could.\n\n165\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:23.140\nSo I'd go set the host name, and\nI would name it I don't know, bld B#.\n\n166\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.280\nAnd that was the name, right?\n\n167\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.490\nAnd so they would always think they were\nin Privileged Mode because that's just\n\n168\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.030\nthe kind of way I roll.\n\n169\n00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.810\nSo set your host names with a pound\nsign and really screw with your friends.\n\n170\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.490\nAll right.\n\n171\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.870\nTo log into the router, notice we're\ngonna go into console mode here.\n\n172\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.790\nRouter con0, right.\n\n173\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.720\nSo now we're in User Mode here.\n\n174\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.170\nThat's were we end up by default.\n\n175\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.490\nI'm gonna type the command enable,\nhence the name enable mode and\n\n176\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.550\nwe're gonna get to Privileged Mode.\n\n177\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.600\nYou can tell because we have\nan original pound sign there.\n\n178\n00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.795\nOkay, and dev disable or\nexit or quit there.\n\n179\n00:07:56.795 --> 00:08:01.596\nSo again, the difference is,\nI can from here.\n\n180\n00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:03.417\nView and change the configuration, can I?\n\n181\n00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.957\nAnd this is on a router switch, and pretty\nmuch, although I'm showing routers here,\n\n182\n00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:08.130\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n183\n00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.679\nThe router switches, they run the same\nIOS now, they're a fusion mode.\n\n184\n00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:15.944\nAll right, now,\nwhen you first boot a router and switch,\n\n185\n00:08:15.944 --> 00:08:18.822\nit ends up in something called Setup Mode,\nright?\n\n186\n00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:23.450\nSo, it comes up and it says would you like\nto enter the initial configuration dialog?\n\n187\n00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.985\nPlease say no, all right?\n\n188\n00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:27.199\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a pretty useless little setup\n\n189\n00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.770\ndialog, right, initial dialog that\nallows you to walk through it.\n\n190\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.546\nNow I can also get there by just going to\nprivileged mode and type in setup, and\n\n191\n00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.070\nit'll walk you through this.\n\n192\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.394\nAnd I recommend for the objectives,\ngoing through a router and\n\n193\n00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:39.847\ntyping it in once, right?\n\n194\n00:08:39.847 --> 00:08:43.747\nSeeing what it asks, and then just getting\nout of it, never using it again, ever,\n\n195\n00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:44.770\nif your entire life.\n\n196\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.766\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right?\n\n197\n00:08:46.766 --> 00:08:49.770\n[LAUGH] Now,\nlet's talk about some router components.\n\n198\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.058\nWe'll start over here.\n\n199\n00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:54.992\nFirst off in ROM, and\nwe do need to remember these for\n\n200\n00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.407\nquite a few objectives in CSN, actually.\n\n201\n00:08:57.407 --> 00:09:02.755\nSo, in the ROM, right,\nwe have the POST test, right?\n\n202\n00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:06.020\nEvery computer has a POST test,\nPower-On Self-Test.\n\n203\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.630\nThat runs.\n\n204\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.040\nAfter that, we run the bootstrap.\n\n205\n00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.324\nAnd what does a bootstrap do,\nMr. Microsoft guy?\n\n206\n00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:14.622\n>> [LAUGH] It allows us to be\nable to boot up the device.\n\n207\n00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:15.759\n>> Yeah, it looks for\nan operating system, doesn't it?\n\n208\n00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:16.281\n>> Right.\n\n209\n00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:19.933\n>> So we come up and, do you\nremember the first Bootstrap in '93?\n\n210\n00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:20.940\n>> I do not.\n\n211\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:21.440\n>> Okay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.068\n>> It came out,\n\n213\n00:09:22.068 --> 00:09:26.007\nthe first thing it did was, we had a disk,\nwe put it in, and the first thing comes up\n\n214\n00:09:26.007 --> 00:09:29.400\nand says, I'm looking for command.com.\nThat was my first bootstrap.\n\n215\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.420\nAll right, so, [LAUGH] I came up there and\nthen we found an operating system.\n\n216\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.830\nNow we're gonna come up here into ROM,\nand we're gonna run the POST.\n\n217\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.270\nWe're gonna look for\nthe bootstrap here, and\n\n218\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.000\nthis bootstrap actually is gonna do what?\n\n219\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.505\nIt's gonna come over here and find my\ninternetworking operating system in flash,\n\n220\n00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:49.810\ninternetworking operating system in flash,\nisn't it?\n\n221\n00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.190\nIt's gonna load that, so I'm gonna\ncome back to this, I'm not done yet.\n\n222\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:02.020\nIt's gonna take this and expand this into\nRAM, so we'll see it expanded into RAM.\n\n223\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.550\nSo it'll run from RAM.\n\n224\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.923\nSo once my router's up and\nhas an operating system into RAM,\n\n225\n00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:10.567\nI can actually delete\nthe IOS out of flash and and\n\n226\n00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:14.357\nkeep running as long as someone\ndoesn't reload my router, right?\n\n227\n00:10:14.357 --> 00:10:19.830\nOkay now, before, right after that then,\nsomething else happens.\n\n228\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.870\nSo once we have the operating system\nin RAM and now we're kind of up and\n\n229\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.470\nrunning with an operating system, it comes\nback to a partition of flash called NVRAM.\n\n230\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.503\nAnd it looks for a configuration\nthat we may have saved in the past.\n\n231\n00:10:35.503 --> 00:10:41.367\nAnd that's a backup configuration named\nStartup-Config, Startup-Config, all right?\n\n232\n00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:43.170\nYou have to put it in there.\n\n233\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.570\nYou put it into the NVRAM, all right?\n\n234\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.890\nReally this is a partition of flash, but I\ndon't want you to get confused with flash\n\n235\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.910\nand NVRAM, because there is a difference.\n\n236\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.390\nFlash, by default, is where we store\nthe operating system of a router or\n\n237\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.190\nswitch, all right?\n\n238\n00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.960\nNVRAM is where we start, so\nwe store a couple things there.\n\n239\n00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.680\nOne of them being the startup-config,\nor backup configuration, and\n\n240\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.980\nyou put that there.\n\n241\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.243\nThere's nothing by default.\n\n242\n00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:11.208\nAnd the other thing we saw in there is a\nconfiguration register as I list here, and\n\n243\n00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:15.013\nwe'll come back to that\nconfiguration register in a minute.\n\n244\n00:11:15.013 --> 00:11:19.498\n[COUGH] So we have to put that in there\nin NVRAM, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n245\n00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:23.026\nthen find the NVRAM,\nthat brings us in to find the NVRAM,\n\n246\n00:11:23.026 --> 00:11:26.890\ncopy that, place it into RAM,\nand name it Running-Config.\n\n247\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.810\nNow that's my active configuration file.\n\n248\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.210\nMy active configuration file\nis called Running-Config,\n\n249\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.130\nthat's the one we're going to change.\n\n250\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.390\nWhenever I make a change,\nthen I'm gonna save that into NVRAM and\n\n251\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.720\noverwrite the startup-config, aren't I?\n\n252\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.670\nOkay, there's a couple\nother commands in here.\n\n253\n00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.202\nSo to see my active configuration,\nshow running-config.\n\n254\n00:11:46.202 --> 00:11:51.350\nShow startup-config to see my backup\nconfiguration, this is my active.\n\n255\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.530\nShow flash,\nshows me all the files in flash memory,\n\n256\n00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:55.900\nwe'll be looking at all of these.\n\n257\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.720\nShow interfaces, a couple others on here\nand then we're gonna go to the next slide,\n\n258\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.770\nbut show version, that's my next slide.\n\n259\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.050\nVery, very important command,\nlots of good detailed information there.\n\n260\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.041\nShow process CPU shows me\nthe CPU utilization, right?\n\n261\n00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.870\nSo there's quite a few\ngood answers on here.\n\n262\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.959\nWhich command will show\nyou your CP utilization?\n\n263\n00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:20.524\nShow process or\nshow process CPU, all right?\n\n264\n00:12:20.524 --> 00:12:21.501\nWe'll come to show protocols.\n\n265\n00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:26.474\nWe're gonna go through all these commands,\nand we're gonna go through these\n\n266\n00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:31.810\nin the next episodes as well in more\ndetail, that's kind of it in a nutshell.\n\n267\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:32.500\nBut I wanna hit show version\ncommand in detail here.\n\n268\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.890\nTake a look here.\n\n269\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.560\nIt says show version.\n\n270\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.370\nIt says I'm running a C1900 Software,\nI'm a 1900 router, right?\n\n271\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.505\nIt's universal, and as we get to licensing\nwe'll understand this better and\n\n272\n00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:45.081\nthat's in the next episode.\n\n273\n00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:48.764\nAnd we're running 15.2 of course\nto keep up with the latest and\n\n274\n00:12:48.764 --> 00:12:51.010\ngreatest CCNA objectives, all right?\n\n275\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.760\nSo this gives us our code right here,\n15.2.\n\n276\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.620\nSo show version sees our code.\n\n277\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.340\nNow, hold on a second, there's a couple\ndifferent ways to do it because, Ronnie,\n\n278\n00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.600\ncouldn't I come back here, if I came here\nand did show flash where it loaded from,\n\n279\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.550\nwouldn't I be able to see that?\n\n280\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.880\nThe answer is I would be able to see\nmy IOS that I'm running in here, but\n\n281\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.270\nwait, the issue, the difference between\nshow flash and show version is this.\n\n282\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.560\nIf I do a show flash it shows me\nall the files in flash memory.\n\n283\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.950\nI might have more than one IOS in there.\n\n284\n00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.460\nWhich one is it running?\n\n285\n00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.490\nWell, by default it's always\nrunning the first one listed, but\n\n286\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.910\nthat doesn't mean that's the one\nit's actually running now.\n\n287\n00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.070\nSo how can I find out\nwhich one is running now?\n\n288\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.190\nBecause the show version\nshows me the actual IOS.\n\n289\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.670\nSo down here, it says right here flash,\nc1900, right?\n\n290\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.105\nThis actually tells me the file\nname of where it loaded from.\n\n291\n00:13:40.105 --> 00:13:42.169\nShow flash will show me all files, right?\n\n292\n00:13:42.169 --> 00:13:46.590\nI could have multiple IOSs in there, I can\nsqueeze in there as many as I can fit.\n\n293\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.275\nShow version will show me the actual file\nthat I'm running and where it loaded from.\n\n294\n00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:53.545\nIt'll actually show me how\nthe system was last booted,\n\n295\n00:13:53.545 --> 00:13:55.650\nright, and how long it's been up.\n\n296\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.363\nUp time 15 seconds.\n\n297\n00:13:57.363 --> 00:14:01.445\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI got this one relatively quickly.\n\n298\n00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:03.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, system image,\n\n299\n00:14:03.845 --> 00:14:05.840\nhow it was last booted.\n\n300\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.700\nCould say by reload, by bus error,\nI've seen a lot of different things.\n\n301\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.020\nNow down here there's an output cut.\n\n302\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.280\nI'm gonna come back to that.\n\n303\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.390\nThat's what the POST test found.\n\n304\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.140\nI'm gonna show that on the next slide.\n\n305\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.090\nBut before I do, I wanna talk\nabout this configuration register.\n\n306\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.780\nThis tells the router how to boot,\nor switch how to boot.\n\n307\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.740\nThis is the default.\n\n308\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.822\n2102 says this, let's go back.\n\n309\n00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:29.670\nIt says, go to flash and\nfind the first IOS, load that into RAM.\n\n310\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.030\nOnce done, go to NVRAM.\n\n311\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.280\nLook for a startup config.\n\n312\n00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.420\nIf found, place that into RAM and\nname it running-config, and\n\n313\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.430\nyou have an active configuration file.\n\n314\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:42.499\nNow, there was more detail to these steps,\nbut that's in a nutshell for right now.\n\n315\n00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:45.461\nSo let's go find out what the POST\ntest found on this, after 15 seconds.\n\n316\n00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:48.709\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> First off, let's see how much,\n\n317\n00:14:48.709 --> 00:14:50.639\nthis tells me how much RAM I had.\n\n318\n00:14:53.275 --> 00:14:54.714\nHow much RAM do I have?\n\n319\n00:14:54.714 --> 00:14:57.175\nNow, that's kind of hard to read,\nall right?\n\n320\n00:14:57.175 --> 00:15:02.655\nSo I mean, not just hard to read in the\nsense it's small, you have to add that up.\n\n321\n00:15:02.655 --> 00:15:04.292\nAnd so we're gonna kinda average that.\n\n322\n00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:07.489\nYou really can't go into Best Buy or\nwhatever it is, say Fry's and,\n\n323\n00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:08.715\nnot Comp USA, whatever.\n\n324\n00:15:08.715 --> 00:15:11.235\nYou can't do that,\nyou have to go in there.\n\n325\n00:15:11.235 --> 00:15:14.173\nAnd you can't say, I need 249 megs of RAM.\n\n326\n00:15:14.173 --> 00:15:15.346\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right,\n\n327\n00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:17.633\neven those guys would think you're crazy.\n\n328\n00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:21.115\n256 megs, right?\n\n329\n00:15:21.115 --> 00:15:23.340\nThat's about what that equals,\nso we're gonna average up here.\n\n330\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.230\nAnd we're gonna come down here, and down\nhere it tells me how much flash I have.\n\n331\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.210\nNow, this is gonna be about 64 megs.\n\n332\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.537\nNow, hold on a second.\n\n333\n00:15:32.537 --> 00:15:36.630\nHere's my NVRAM right here,\nthat's a partition of flash, right?\n\n334\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.600\nSo that's a piece of this,\nwhy we don't see the whole 64, right?\n\n335\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.190\nSo, [COUGH] Here's my\nconfiguration register.\n\n336\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:47.420\nI can see I found 2 FastEthernets,\n2 Serials, VPN module, and\n\n337\n00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.620\nwe have 256 Megs of RAM, and\n64 Megs of flash in this router.\n\n338\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.927\nThis is a good place to see it.\n\n339\n00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:57.155\nThe configuration register,\nlet's talk about that number.\n\n340\n00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:58.478\nThe 2102 is the default.\n\n341\n00:15:58.478 --> 00:15:59.535\nLet's take a look.\n\n342\n00:15:59.535 --> 00:16:05.220\nLoad the IOS from Flash and\nthen the configuration from NVRAM, right.\n\n343\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.840\nPretty much the default what I gave you,\nthat's the big picture of it.\n\n344\n00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.360\nThe router looks in NVRAM for\nthe boot sequence, again,\n\n345\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.520\nthe configuration\nregister is stored there.\n\n346\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.560\n2102 says this, but I can change this.\n\n347\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.050\nWe typically only change the NVRAM for\none reason today.\n\n348\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.320\nRight, 2100 is gonna load\nthe wrong monitor mode.\n\n349\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.932\nSo you do need to know these for\nthe objectives.\n\n350\n00:16:25.932 --> 00:16:27.840\nAll right, I never really do this again,\n\n351\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.120\nbecause the other way to\nget into raw monitor mode.\n\n352\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.350\nBoot the router, do a control break.\n\n353\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:38.402\nRight, or control shift six, let go press\nB, that's another way to do it on my Mac.\n\n354\n00:16:38.402 --> 00:16:40.710\nAll right,\n2101 says load the mini-iOS from ROM.\n\n355\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.310\nSo I didn't mention this I showed it\nhere because most routers don't have\n\n356\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.350\nthis anymore.\n\n357\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.880\nNotice I wrote it here scalp in IOS.\n\n358\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.330\nA lot of older routers have a little\nmini IOS in there if the IOS\n\n359\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.410\nfailed loaded this.\n\n360\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.200\nIt was more of a boot helper that allowed\nyou to restore the IOS in a easy to\n\n361\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.830\ndo fashion.\n\n362\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.670\nYou did me end up in ROM Monitor Mode.\n\n363\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.690\nMost of the time you just end\nup in ROM Monitor Mode today.\n\n364\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.490\nDepends on your router, but\nthat's pretty much the case.\n\n365\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.350\nSo 2101 might load you into a Mini-IOS,\nbut\n\n366\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:14.550\n2142 is probably the one\nI used the most today.\n\n367\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.720\nAll right so 2102 and 2142 the fact is,\nlook at what it's going to do.\n\n368\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.040\nLoad OS from Flash and\ndo not load startup-config.\n\n369\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.380\nWhy wouldn't I want to do that?\n\n370\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.580\nThat sound ridiculous.\n\n371\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.800\nPassword recovery, right?\n\n372\n00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.620\nTo be able to change it to this,\nyou go into ROM Monitor Mode.\n\n373\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.580\nHow do you get to ROM Monitor Mode?\n\n374\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.920\nWell you can't change the configuration\nregistered to this because\n\n375\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.460\nyou can't get into your router.\n\n376\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.370\nRight?\nAnd so you go into your router and\n\n377\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.860\nchange it with this command.\n\n378\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.840\nBut I can't do it.\n\n379\n00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.470\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n380\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.910\nI'm gonna boot the router,\n\n381\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.260\ncontrol break or I'm gonna hit a ROM\nmonitor mode when I boot the router\n\n382\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.410\nin a couple of different break\nsequences whichever one works for you.\n\n383\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.630\nThen I could type this in.\n\n384\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.730\nSo to come back and\nwe'll have a greater than sign.\n\n385\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:05.600\nI'll type Confreg 0x, it's an x, right?\n\n386\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.300\n2142, and then the next one it'll come\nback in a greater than sign then I'll\n\n387\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.620\ntype I, for initialize.\n\n388\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.170\nType, I, for initialize, and\n\n389\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.960\nthen my router will reboot and it'll\nload the IOS without startup confreg.\n\n390\n00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.980\nNow I'm gonna be in user mode.\n\n391\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.030\nI type enable.\n\n392\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.630\nGets to privilege mode.\n\n393\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.850\nFirst I end up in setup mode really\ncuz I know sorry I've been vague.\n\n394\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.000\nGet up to privilege mode.\n\n395\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.940\nThen I'll type the commands\nwhich we'll see in a minute.\n\n396\n00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.600\nCopy start run.\n\n397\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.350\nRight?\nTo move in the commands.\n\n398\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.840\nAnd now I have my configuration\nback in Running config and\n\n399\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.660\nI'm past the point where it's\ngoing to ask me the password, and\n\n400\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.430\nnow I can change my password\nto do password config.\n\n401\n00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.980\nVery, very cool.\nAll right,\n\n402\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.700\nto view the configuration show run.\n\n403\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.380\nNow there's something I wanna\nshow you guys here, show run.\n\n404\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.850\nThe current configuration how big it is,\nbut one of the things, this\n\n405\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:59.010\nis how Cisco gets you and even confused me\nfor a second He had a question like this.\n\n406\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:04.980\nWhich of the following commands\nwill show your iOS version?\n\n407\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.750\nWell, show version,\nshow flash, those were simple.\n\n408\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.060\nAnd then I was like I don't know.\n\n409\n00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.800\nAnd then show run, you're like,\nrunning-config and all that and then I had\n\n410\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:19.750\nto remember, the very top of the output of\nthe show run is your iOS version, right?\n\n411\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.710\nThat's at the very,\nvery top of the show running-config.\n\n412\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.290\nThat was very helpful right there,\nthat's why I put this in here.\n\n413\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.190\nShow run will show me my active\nconfiguration and the show startup,\n\n414\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.480\nit shows it as well.\n\n415\n00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.220\nIt tells me how much I'm using in NV RAM,\nin my IOS version as well.\n\n416\n00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.580\nRight?\nSo we're not typing those in to see that.\n\n417\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.390\nI'm just saying that you\ncan see that from there.\n\n418\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.650\nThe router modes.\n\n419\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.170\nFirst off, I'm in user mode here.\n\n420\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.160\nAnd, from user mode,\nI'm gonna type enable.\n\n421\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.430\nAnd end up in the privilege mode, and from\nhere I'm gonna type configure terminal or,\n\n422\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.640\nI don't type all the full commands,\nI put it in here just to be, I don't know,\n\n423\n00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.370\na good teacher someday,\nanyways config t is all I type,\n\n424\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.510\nthat takes me to what's called\nmobile configuration mode.\n\n425\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.360\nNow I can change the router at whole,\n\n426\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.510\nright, from there I can tell\nthe specific configuration modes.\n\n427\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.270\nSo really to get it in and configure\nyour router you go to the console,\n\n428\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.030\nyou press Enter, you type enable,\nand then config t.\n\n429\n00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.610\nIf we're setting it up at first,\nthere's no passwords or anything.\n\n430\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.360\nSo then we can go ahead and\nset out passwords and all that and\n\n431\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.190\nwe'll have to enter passwords from now on.\n\n432\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.800\n>> Now Tom, let me ask you\na question since you brought it.\n\n433\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.880\nI always get a question,\nyou probably do too.\n\n434\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.560\nOn the exam, are the abbreviations\nallowed, not allowed?\n\n435\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.730\n>> Yeah, absolutely they are.\n\n436\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.900\n>> Okay.\n>> So there's some things that don't work,\n\n437\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.180\nlimited help, tab key I don't think\nworks or something like that.\n\n438\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.690\nShow run.\n\n439\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.430\nI don't know of anyone that's\nhad a problem with show run or\n\n440\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.940\nanything like that, config t.\n\n441\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.340\nThere might be some\ncommands that are disabled,\n\n442\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.050\nlike maybe you get a sim or something that\nsays hey, what's this, this, and this, and\n\n443\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.860\nyou try to do show run and it says that\ncommand is disabled, so you have to know\n\n444\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.080\nthe other commands to be able to get\nthat information, something like that.\n\n445\n00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.350\nAll right, so from here,\nlet's say that I was at global config, so\n\n446\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.420\nthis tells me I'm at global\nconfig here and I type here,\n\n447\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.070\nI can type actually control z or\nEN to go back.\n\n448\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.500\nBut in this case here, let's get rid\nof that, I'm gonna type interface e0.\n\n449\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.570\nNow again those are generic interfaces,\n\n450\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.310\nno such thing as an e0 on an iOS router,\nNexus yes not in iOS.\n\n451\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.690\nAnyways, it would be fast season\ngigabit or 10 gig something like that.\n\n452\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.770\nBut nonetheless so\nI'm just using e0 as a generic example for\n\n453\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.980\nsome type of ethernet Interface.\n\n454\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.780\nI'm gonna end up here at this prompt.\n\n455\n00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.910\nAnd you know what this prompt stands for?\n\n456\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.083\nIf I only knew which\ninterface I was configuring.\n\n457\n00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:40.065\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what that stands for.\n\n458\n00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:44.190\nAnd like every other vendor in the entire\nuniverse that lists the interface that\n\n459\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.988\nyou're configuring, Cisco does not, never\nhave, never will with the iOS, right?\n\n460\n00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:49.450\nSo anyways, config-if.\n\n461\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.440\nYou have to know where you're at.\n\n462\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.020\nThis is why you make more money than say,\nI don't know, working at 7-11 or\n\n463\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.095\nsomething, because you know which\ninterface you're configuring.\n\n464\n00:21:56.095 --> 00:21:58.020\nConfig-if, I'm configuring E0.\n\n465\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.745\nNow if I forget,\nI just type it in again, interface E0.\n\n466\n00:22:00.745 --> 00:22:02.735\nPress NR Right,\ndoesn't make any difference.\n\n467\n00:22:02.735 --> 00:22:08.083\nNow from here I can set the IP address and\nenable it I love this iPad.\n\n468\n00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:09.647\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:22:09.647 --> 00:22:11.005\n>> It's really screwing with me today,\n\n470\n00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:11.855\nhave you noticed this?\n\n471\n00:22:11.855 --> 00:22:13.845\n>> I have.\n>> I know it's really screwing with me.\n\n472\n00:22:13.845 --> 00:22:17.785\nAnyways, where was I?\n\n473\n00:22:17.785 --> 00:22:22.015\nIP address enables interfaces that and\nwhat whatever else, so typically on your\n\n474\n00:22:22.015 --> 00:22:24.540\ninterfaces, we're gonna go put an IP\naddress in and enable them right?\n\n475\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.600\nNow I can also create something\ncalled a sub interface.\n\n476\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.570\nSo if I'm here, I can just type interface\ne0, again, generic, .10 whatever.\n\n477\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.500\nWe're gonna do that when\nwe get to the line routing.\n\n478\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.180\nAnd I was about to say frame relay\nbecause we used to do that so much,\n\n479\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.750\nbut no more sub interfaces, no more relay.\n\n480\n00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.580\n>> Hey.\n>> All right, so\n\n481\n00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.150\nthat would take me into a sub interface\nwhich is a logical interface.\n\n482\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.098\nWe will learn about those.\n\n483\n00:22:47.098 --> 00:22:48.760\nAll right, config-line.\n\n484\n00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.800\nSo if i was at global config and I said,\n\n485\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.190\nline con 0, console 0,\nauxiliary 0, VTY for\n\n486\n00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.360\nmy talented SSH passwords, whatever,\nI'm gonna end up a the config-line prompt.\n\n487\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.100\nAgain, you don't know which line you're,\njust by looking at the prompt.\n\n488\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.100\nBut you know you're configuring a line.\n\n489\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:14.660\nAnd then I could also do something from up\nhere, like router, god don't ever do this.\n\n490\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.220\nBut router rip,\nif you did type in router rip there.\n\n491\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.200\nYou know what's kinda funny, and\nI've seen this since 1990 guys,\n\n492\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.485\nthat's how long I've been doing this.\n\n493\n00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:24.430\nRouter(config-router).\n\n494\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.620\nWe're not actually configuring a router.\n\n495\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.000\nWe're configuring a routing protocol,\nso why in the last, I don't know,\n\n496\n00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.190\n30 years this hasn't been\nchanged to config-routing,\n\n497\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.080\nbut that would just make sense.\n\n498\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.310\nI don't know.\n\n499\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.340\nI'm old and jaded.\n\n500\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.150\nAll right,\ncopy run start to save my config.\n\n501\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.220\nTo save my config, remember in\nNVRAM I showed you it's there, but\n\n502\n00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.980\nI told you you have to put it in there.\n\n503\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.540\nSo I don't like to type it in like\nyou Ronnie, like you were typing it.\n\n504\n00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.550\nCopy run start.\n\n505\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.500\nDoes anyone out there know the old\ncommand, IP, yeah, David my not charging.\n\n506\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.131\nI don't know, let's all get on\nthe phone and complain to Apple,\n\n507\n00:23:57.131 --> 00:24:00.842\nSteve Jobs, not Steve Jobs [INAUDIBLE],\nsorry that was terrible.\n\n508\n00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:02.715\nWhat's his name, the new guy?\n\n509\n00:24:02.715 --> 00:24:03.779\n>> For-\n>> Apple.\n\n510\n00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:05.799\nI was gonna

run start, now I'm really lazy\nas it is, so I just do the WR.\n\n519\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.040\nYou can do that, but\nit's not an objective, I got to tell you.\n\n520\n00:24:29.040 -->

destination filename,\nand that's startup-config.\n\n523\n00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:41.780\nStartup-config.\n\n524\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.970\nVerify your destination name,\nand then press Enter.\n\n525\n00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.800\nNow, why did they do this?\n\n526\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.560\nWell it was kind of a problem\nin the earlier codes.\n\n527\n00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.038\nIt was kinda funny,\nbecause I'd have students type this,\n\n528\n00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:57.800\nwe'd be here, and say #copy run,\nwhich kind of makes sense.\n\n529\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.770\nAnd don't type this in.\n\n530\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.970\nWhen I tell students, don't do this,\n\n531\n00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.380\nthey end up doing it on my routers and\nit takes me all day to recover them.\n\n532\n00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.535\n#copy run save, and then you press enter,\n\n533\n00:25:07.535 --> 00:25:10.810\nand your router commits suicide\n[LAUGH] that's what would happen.\n\n534\n00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.782\nSo here's what it would do, it would erase\nyour config, it would erase your ios, and\n\n535\n00:25:13.782 --> 00:25:15.480\nit would reboot your router.\n\n536\n00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.720\nHello, all right?\n\n537\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.070\nSo this was like ten years ago or\nwhatever, so they came up with this,\n\n538\n00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.960\nlet's put this in here.\n\n539\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.690\nAnd then they actually fixed that but\nit doesn't happen anymore, but it did,\n\n540\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.600\nit did erase your flash and reload\nthe router, it was a terrible thing.\n\n541\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.670\nSo, now we have to verify our\ndestination file name Now,\n\n542\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.140\ncopy start run, be careful guys here.\n\n543\n00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.870\nThis is not a full copy of your backup,\n\n544\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.870\nso let's say that you were changing\nthings since you rebooted your router and\n\n545\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:47.240\nyou made a bunch of changes and you're\nlike, Man, this kinda stinks, right?\n\n546\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.720\nSo I said copy start run would put back,\nnow, it doesn't put back the file.\n\n547\n00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.250\nIf you want to get it back to where you\nstarted from you'd have to reload your\n\n548\n00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.540\nrouter, no doubt about it.\n\n549\n00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.830\nJust stop what you're doing,\npower off and turn on your router.\n\n550\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.070\nNot always feasible in production\nnetworks today, right?\n\n551\n00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.940\nI don't think so.\n\n552\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.410\nSo this is more of a merge.\n\n553\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.530\nThis is more of a merge, right?\n\n554\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.440\nSo we're gonna take out what\nyou've changed as long as you\n\n555\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.790\nhaven't added something in there\nthat we didn't have before.\n\n556\n00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.710\nSo if you configured a new\ninterface It won't remove that\n\n557\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.680\nbecause that wasn't configured.\n\n558\n00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.860\nIt will only change back what was\nalready configured, all right?\n\n559\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.280\nSo administrative functions, and\n\n560\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.500\nwe're going to get out and\ndo some configuration.\n\n561\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.070\nThese include host names,\nbanners interface descriptions,\n\n562\n00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.090\npasswords, these are pretty important,\nI seriously go out to customers And\n\n563\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.760\nthey're going to have this done.\n\n564\n00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.540\nHow do you troubleshoot a network\nwithout a hostname at a minimum?\n\n565\n00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.900\nBanners and interface descriptions, let me\ntell you something, I go out to customers,\n\n566\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.180\nthe network's running, so\nis any of this absolutely necessary?\n\n567\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:44.850\nNo.\n\n568\n00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.060\nYou can get everything up and running but\nyou can't troubleshoot anything, right?\n\n569\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.390\nAnd then of course they do have the\npasswords, so at a minimum they set their\n\n570\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.870\npasswords, but maybe we should\nat least set our host name.\n\n571\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.535\nI'm just saying, you know?\n\n572\n00:26:57.535 --> 00:26:59.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you would think yeah, no,\n\n573\n00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.020\nthat's obvious,\neveryone in the world does that.\n\n574\n00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.140\nNo they don't.\n\n575\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.590\nNo, I go up to many customers\nthat have never done it.\n\n576\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.040\nHow do we set a hosting?\n\n577\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.680\nWell, this is relatively simple.\n\n578\n00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.480\nWhere are we, Ronnie, what is this?\n\n579\n00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.560\nGlobal config, global config.\n\n580\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.790\nSo, how did I get here?\n\n581\n00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.890\n>> You did your config e-\n>> I did enable first.\n\n582\n00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.090\n>> Enable-\n>> Yup, I'm being detailed, buddy.\n\n583\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.760\nAnd then config T, right?\n\n584\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.880\nTrying to go slow and detailed.\n\n585\n00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:34.870\nHostname, and i put the hostname in and\neveryone should name their routers Todd.\n\n586\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.020\nAbsolutely.\n\n587\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.770\nThat would be very helpful, if everyone\nin the world named their routers Todd.\n\n588\n00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.610\nAll right, I would love that.\n\n589\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.930\nSo when I put out my first book,\nI'll tell you a story.\n\n590\n00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.560\nI've got to stop and tell you a story.\n\n591\n00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.500\nSo, Cisco put out a memo, it was.\n\n592\n00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.540\nLate 99.\n\n593\n00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:53.360\nAnd cuz in my book I set all my passwords\nto Todd and everyone was following my\n\n594\n00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.440\nbook, it's a true story, gonna put a memo,\ndo not set your passwords to Todd.\n\n595\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.070\nIt's a true story.\n\n596\n00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.250\nI love that story.\n\n597\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.343\nTrue story, love it, I love it.\n\n598\n00:28:01.343 --> 00:28:05.890\nAnyways, now we can set a banner motd.\n\n599\n00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.640\nMessage of the day.\n\n600\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.020\nNow this started in what, the 60s?\n\n601\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.090\nThis is around since dirt right?\n\n602\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.920\nBanners are nothing new.\n\n603\n00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.560\nNow should you put something like hey\nwelcome to you know, expensivebank.com,\n\n604\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.120\nyou know whatever.\n\n605\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.250\n>> You should not do that.\n\n606\n00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.370\n>> And what would happen if I did,\nis that a big deal?\n\n607\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.810\n>> It can be a big deal\ndepending on where you are but\n\n608\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.390\nyes, remember that you're\nactually inviting someone to\n\n609\n00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.073\nget access and\n>> Even if you don't intend to actually\n\n610\n00:28:32.073 --> 00:28:33.515\ninvite somebody to get access [CROSSTALK].\n\n611\n00:28:33.515 --> 00:28:34.840\n>> That's right.\n\n612\n00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.490\nThe reason that this is, there was\nactually a lawsuit in the very early 90s\n\n613\n00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.660\nwhere they said Welcome to Acme Network or\nwhatever.\n\n614\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.540\nSued the hacker, the guy won\nbecause it said welcome, right?\n\n615\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.400\nHe says, what, they welcomed me.\n\n616\n00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.620\nTrue story again.\n\n617\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.505\nAll I do is tell mostly true stories.\n\n618\n00:28:49.505 --> 00:28:52.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Banner message of the day.\n\n619\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.170\nAnd I'm gonna say, this is my P1R1 router.\n\n620\n00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.240\nReally what this needs to say,\n\n621\n00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.870\nis if you're not authorized\nto be in Acme network,\n\n622\n00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.020\nyou need to disconnect immediately.\n\n623\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.787\nI would highly, as a matter of fact,\nthat's a objective,\n\n624\n00:29:01.787 --> 00:29:02.384\nI just remembered that.\n\n625\n00:29:02.384 --> 00:29:02.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n626\n00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.320\nif you're looking at a configuration,\n\n627\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.190\nand you see something that says welcome,\n>> I would call that\n\n628\n00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.410\na security risk, wouldn't you?\n\n629\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:08.940\n>> Yes.\n>> See,\n\n630\n00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.370\nI brought this up, this story on purpose,\nI was getting to them.\n\n631\n00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.760\n>> And the password of Todd,\nis probably [LAUGH]\n\n632\n00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.550\n>> There's a method, I liked it.\n\n633\n00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.800\nEveryone set your host name to Todd and\npasswords to Todd.\n\n634\n00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.110\nThat would make the world a better place.\n\n635\n00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.430\nAll right,\nnotice here I have ethernet zero,\n\n636\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.470\nno such thing in this world anymore,\nreally.\n\n637\n00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:27.390\nBut nonetheless I'm just showing you\nNow when I was at triple a we had like\n\n638\n00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:32.510\nthree thousand land links and it was\njust a real bare to something like this.\n\n639\n00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.940\nSo this is was early 90s and\n\n640\n00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.160\nyou know the circuits went down constantly\nit's not like the networks today right?\n\n641\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.330\nSo what I did was put out descriptions\non all the interface I mean we're like\n\n642\n00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.850\n>> Hundreds and\n\n643\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.600\nhundreds and hundreds of interfaces.\n\n644\n00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600\nTook forever.\n\n645\n00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.550\nThe description was like,\nWAN to Miami, the circuit number, and\n\n646\n00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:57.260\nhere's the other thing, the phone number\nto call because back then you called and\n\n647\n00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.780\ngo that's PAC-BELL or\nthat was a different telephone company.\n\n648\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.020\nWe didn't have ISP's then.\n\n649\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.260\nAll right, so\nto view your descriptions show run.\n\n650\n00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.220\nHold on a second, you're thinking,\nwell, I don't care about descriptions.\n\n651\n00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.700\nSure you do,\nespecially on the exam objectives.\n\n652\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.000\nYou're doing a for\nthe exam objectives, you're testing.\n\n653\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.480\nAnd someone's asking you what's going\non with your neighbor here, but yet\n\n654\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.530\nin the figure I see no interface names.\n\n655\n00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.480\nHow do you see it?\n\n656\n00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.850\nWell the descriptions.\n\n657\n00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.160\nSo how do we see those?\n\n658\n00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.280\nWell show interface would do it, and\nshow interface or whatever it is, or\n\n659\n00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.230\nshow run if you can.\n\n660\n00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.670\nAnd that'll show you my description.\n\n661\n00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.860\nIt'll say connection to sim\nlab b interface, whatever.\n\n662\n00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.800\nNow, so your description all of a sudden\nbecame important here on the objectives.\n\n663\n00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.260\nAll right, now to set my\npasswords here line console 0.\n\n664\n00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.800\nPassword todd, of course [laughs].\n\n665\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.100\nSo I go to global config.\n\n666\n00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.330\nSo I did this by config T.\n\n667\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.025\n>> You are responsible for all the easy\npasswords that are on the internet Todd.\n\n668\n00:30:58.025 --> 00:30:58.610\n>> [laughs} I know right?\n\n669\n00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.720\nIt is not anymore.\n\n670\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.540\nThat was a long time ago.\n\n671\n00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.480\n>> Now here's the key though on your lines\nthough, and this is what gets people.\n\n672\n00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.320\nLike I'll get students in class and\nthey do one thing and it doesn't work.\n\n673\n00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.440\nIt's three step process, right?\n\n674\n00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.450\nOne you choose your line.\n\n675\n00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.190\nAnd then of course it's not gonna\ntell you which one you're doing.\n\n676\n00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.050\nTwo, set your password.\n\n677\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.040\nAnd three, enable the login process.\n\n678\n00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.560\nNow when I say login,\n\n679\n00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.950\nI'm saying the password is\nunderneath in the configuration,\n\n680\n00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.420\nthe acting configuration,\nunder the console line itself.\n\n681\n00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.480\nRight?\nSo it's actually gonna\n\n682\n00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.670\ngo look in the acting configuration\nunder the line itself.\n\n683\n00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.170\nNow, we're gonna change that here,\nshortly in the next episode.\n\n684\n00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.370\nI'm gonna change where we're\ngonna get our password.\n\n685\n00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.780\nIn the next week we're gonna get a in\nfrom external servers and so on.\n\n686\n00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.020\nBut in this case I just want a simple\nlogin, no if I don't put login here,\n\n687\n00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.240\ni'm not going to be prompted for\na password, it's just going to let me in.\n\n688\n00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.366\nSo let's say I have a password, I have\nthis done, I don't want this any more.\n\n689\n00:31:52.366 --> 00:31:55.403\nI just want to get in because I'm at home\nI don't want to be prompted anymore,\n\n690\n00:31:55.403 --> 00:31:56.686\njust go in here and say no login.\n\n691\n00:31:56.686 --> 00:31:59.394\nThe other thing is i'm going to go in\nhere and do my auxiliary port now.\n\n692\n00:31:59.394 --> 00:32:00.032\nNow.\n\n693\n00:32:00.032 --> 00:32:01.472\nAll right so here's one.\n\n694\n00:32:01.472 --> 00:32:02.691\nI choose my line.\n\n695\n00:32:02.691 --> 00:32:06.770\nSet my password and then my login process.\n\n696\n00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.600\nAlright where is my password?\n\n697\n00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.400\nThat's what I'm telling it.\n\n698\n00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.680\nWhere to go find my password?\n\n699\n00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.120\nThree steps.\n\n700\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.950\nPretty simple.\n\n701\n00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:14.610\nPretty simple, no?\n\n702\n00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.140\nOkay we're almost done with routers and\nswitches and configure this.\n\n703\n00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.520\nA couple of commands I wanna give you\nthat are helpful that are administration\n\n704\n00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.600\nthat I found.\n\n705\n00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.000\nThe first one is a C sin objective,\nline console 0 exec-timeout.\n\n706\n00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.650\nThis is minutes and seconds.\n\n707\n00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.540\nNow if you're in production,\nleave this alone.\n\n708\n00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.720\nIt's set for ten minutes by default.\n\n709\n00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.390\nJust leave it, if you have inactivity\nit's gonna log you out after ten minutes.\n\n710\n00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.010\nI'll come in and\nset it to 0 0 when I'm doing labs because\n\n711\n00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.540\nI don't want them timing out.\n\n712\n00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.720\nBut don't do it in production.\n\n713\n00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.560\nRight?\n\n714\n00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.892\nIf we see a zero under a process in Cisco,\nit means infinity.\n\n715\n00:32:47.892 --> 00:32:51.380\nAll right, now the other one is\nreally helpful non objective\n\n716\n00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.210\nnot enabled by default\nuntil you get to that.\n\n717\n00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.260\nNexus is an awesome operating system,\nright?.\n\n718\n00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.920\nWe're tolerating the iOS at this point,\nright?\n\n719\n00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.860\nSo anyways, go to my console 0 and\nI'm typing the command,\n\n720\n00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.880\nI'm booking on my config, I'm gonna be out\nof here I go to go see the game, whatever.\n\n721\n00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.570\nAnd something goes down, and what happens?\n\n722\n00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.682\nEvery sys log and\n\n723\n00:33:13.682 --> 00:33:18.622\nsys log 7 which is all the bloody\nmessages by default was at your console.\n\n724\n00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:22.672\nAnd I bring that up cuz I'm gonna talk\nabout that in two episodes from now in my\n\n725\n00:33:22.672 --> 00:33:23.508\nsys log stuff.\n\n726\n00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:26.670\nBut so it's gonna come across and\nit writes over when you're typing in and\n\n727\n00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.940\nyou're, what?\n\n728\n00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.980\nRight?\nSo, you're no longer looking.\n\n729\n00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:34.260\nYou didn't know this, but\nyou can do a control l to redisplay it.\n\n730\n00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.830\nAnd the other thing is I can\ncome in here under the line, so\n\n731\n00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:44.480\nnow I'm in the line, I choose my line and\nI say logging synchronous.\n\n732\n00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.330\nThis displays the information\nabove what you're typing.\n\n733\n00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.994\nIt actually redisplays what you're doing.\n\n734\n00:33:48.994 --> 00:33:52.852\nBut the fact is why this isn't it in\nby default is kind of the bane of my\n\n735\n00:33:52.852 --> 00:33:54.291\nexistence with the iOS.\n\n736\n00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's one of those things.\n\n737\n00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.570\nWhy is this on by default\nright now forever?\n\n738\n00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.420\nAnd they're just,\nat this point they've got to 15 2 and\n\n739\n00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.430\nthey're never going to do it.\n\n740\n00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.610\nRight?\nSo, now to do my vty password, right?\n\n741\n00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.870\nThis is where I'm gonna do,\nfirst off my Telnet and then SSH stuff.\n\n742\n00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.460\nBut line vty, first line, last line.\n\n743\n00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.970\nNow let's talk about this for a minute.\n\n744\n00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:14.630\nSo how many lines do you have?\n\n745\n00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.160\nYou need to configure them all cuz\nwhat line you gonna end up on?\n\n746\n00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.120\nI don't know, but if I just configured\nline 0, gonna end up there.\n\n747\n00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.460\nProbably not, so if I said line vty 0,\nthat'll only configure one line.\n\n748\n00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.610\nThat might be a CC objective\nthey might ask you.\n\n749\n00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.860\nSay, configure one line.\n\n750\n00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.950\nI'm okay, line vty 0, is that gonna work?\n\n751\n00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:30.930\nProbably not.\n\n752\n00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:33.220\nThe fact is, is that if I had 187 lines or\n\n753\n00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.450\nmore some of my routers have thousands\nbecause they're access servers.\n\n754\n00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.556\nAnd so I don't know which\nline you're gonna come in on.\n\n755\n00:34:39.556 --> 00:34:41.113\nWhich line,\nwhen you Telnet in do you end up on?\n\n756\n00:34:41.113 --> 00:34:44.483\nI don't know, which ever one feels\ngood to Telnet at the time, right?\n\n757\n00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:45.100\nTo the router.\n\n758\n00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.040\nAnyway, so I'm gonna choose all my lines.\n\n759\n00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.090\nSo how do I do that?\n\n760\n00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.700\nPretty easy.\nI could do a couple commands to see\n\n761\n00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:55.070\nthe lines but line vty 0, space, and\nI'm gonna do a question mark here.\n\n762\n00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.630\nDon't press Enter.\n\n763\n00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.800\nA lot of people do zero,\nspace, question mark, Enter.\n\n764\n00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.100\nAnd that kinda gets you out of\nthe question mark, so don't do that.\n\n765\n00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.310\nSo it's line vty 0 space, question mark.\n\n766\n00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.170\nAnd it'll give you what\nyour next parameters are.\n\n767\n00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.370\nIn this case it'll show\nyour last line number.\n\n768\n00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.190\nAnd then you just type it in cuz it\nalready is gonna say line vty 0,\n\n769\n00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.570\nwaiting for you to enter whatever\nprimary you found with a question mark.\n\n770\n00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.290\nI'm gonna type in the last press and\nenter and configure all of my lines now.\n\n771\n00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.720\nThat's the best way to go.\n\n772\n00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.070\nSet my password, so one, two, and\nthen you want to type in login.\n\n773\n00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.580\nNow logins enable by default because\nTelnet does not work by default.\n\n774\n00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.540\nSo, that's a good thing, right?\n\n775\n00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.990\nSo unless you configure TelNet,\nthere is no TelNet, right?\n\n776\n00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.380\nNo TelNet password, no TelNet.\n\n777\n00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.740\nNow so I'm going to come in here,\nI'll just type in login for fun,\n\n778\n00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.250\nbut again it's all there by default.\n\n779\n00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.500\nNow if you're at home and or\nyou know in your lab and you don't want\n\n780\n00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.770\nto type in your Telnet password,\ncuz it is annoying when I'm doing labs.\n\n781\n00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.350\nJust type in no login.\n\n782\n00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.670\nI highly recommend not\ndoing that in production.\n\n783\n00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.330\nRight?\nThat would kinda probably be a bad thing.\n\n784\n00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.790\nOkay.\n\n785\n00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.560\nTwo passwords.\n\n786\n00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.390\nThen, those are, I just gave you\nthe user mode passwords, didn't I?\n\n787\n00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.000\nHow do I get in to user mode?\n\n788\n00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.498\nUseless mode, that's all we did.\n\n789\n00:36:01.498 --> 00:36:03.360\nNow we're gonna come in here and\n\n790\n00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.940\nto global config I want to set,\nhow do I get into enable privilege mode?\n\n791\n00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.660\nWell I'm gonna use enable password.\n\n792\n00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.690\nWell the original password was the enable\npassword here right so enable password and\n\n793\n00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.620\nthen the password, okay?\n\n794\n00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.640\nSo you could use that one but\n\n795\n00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.550\nI highly don't,\nI recommend probably using the next one.\n\n796\n00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.064\nIt's really not all that, it is encrypted\nby default but here's what you do,\n\n797\n00:36:23.064 --> 00:36:23.927\nhere's what I do.\n\n798\n00:36:23.927 --> 00:36:27.411\nI type enable secret and\nthen the password, right?\n\n799\n00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:31.350\nAnd then if you see someone's running\nconfig, copy it, paste it into Google, and\n\n800\n00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.390\nit will come back with the answer, right?\n\n801\n00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.560\nWe're not talking about\nsomething super secret here.\n\n802\n00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.537\nIt's pretty easy to find these passwords\nif you can get the encryption.\n\n803\n00:36:39.537 --> 00:36:40.862\nSo encrypting your passwords,\n\n804\n00:36:40.862 --> 00:36:43.477\nthe key is making sure no one\ngets your configuration, right?\n\n805\n00:36:43.477 --> 00:36:44.940\nCuz a lot of people print them out.\n\n806\n00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.200\nMake sure you store them in a safe or\nsomething like that.\n\n807\n00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.510\nThe one you should use is enable\nsecret and there is a reason why.\n\n808\n00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.160\nFirst off, it is encrypted by default.\n\n809\n00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.733\nOkay, that's good I guess but\n\n810\n00:36:54.733 --> 00:36:58.210\nthe second thing is that it\nsupersedes this first one, right?\n\n811\n00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:59.140\nSo use enable secret.\n\n812\n00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.590\nNow here's what people do.\n\n813\n00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.722\nSo in my class I'll have\npeople do enable password.\n\n814\n00:37:02.722 --> 00:37:03.990\nI have them do exactly this.\n\n815\n00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.858\nEnable password lammle,\n\n816\n00:37:04.858 --> 00:37:08.900\nthen they type in this enable\nsecret password globalnet, right?\n\n817\n00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.340\nWhat's their password now?\n\n818\n00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.350\nPassword space globalnet.\n\n819\n00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.820\nPassword that's the password, right?\n\n820\n00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.000\nI say that all the time.\n\n821\n00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.110\nSo be careful here to enable\nsecret in the password.\n\n822\n00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.460\nIt's not an enable secret password\nglobalnet in this example, right?\n\n823\n00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.100\nSo here it is right here, your objectives.\n\n824\n00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.680\nEnable secret is encrypted by default and\nsupersedes the enable password if set.\n\n825\n00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.140\nNow to encrypt your passwords,\nwe don't really have to do a lot.\n\n826\n00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.350\nWe encrypted our enable secret but\n\n827\n00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.060\nthe rest of them are clear\ntext by default, right?\n\n828\n00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.378\nSo, we're gonna come in here to global\nconfig and say service password so\n\n829\n00:37:39.378 --> 00:37:40.941\nwe're turning on a process here.\n\n830\n00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:43.926\nNow, depending on your router, a lot of\ntimes, I'd have people turn it on and\n\n831\n00:37:43.926 --> 00:37:45.940\nthen encrypt their\npasswords to turn it off.\n\n832\n00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.770\nBut really, seriously,\nwith the newer routers,\n\n833\n00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.180\nthe 1900s, these are some pretty\nseriously powerful routers.\n\n834\n00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.130\nWe don't have to turn off extra\nprocesses like we used to.\n\n835\n00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.940\nSo, just turn on service\npassword encryption leave it on.\n\n836\n00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.890\nThis will encrypt all current and\nfuture passwords.\n\n837\n00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.820\nSo all you have to do, I'm just showing\nyou, if you turn it on and you're gonna\n\n838\n00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.550\nturn it off, you have try to view your\npasswords before they are encrypted.\n\n839\n00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:11.090\nIt'll encrypt the passwords in\nthe plain text configuration.\n\n840\n00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:15.670\nRemember you're running config and\nstart up config files that are in ram and\n\n841\n00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.060\nenvi ram respectively or\njust ask your text files, right?\n\n842\n00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.330\nSo it's gonna encrypt them in\nthe plain text configuration file.\n\n843\n00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.320\nAll right, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n844\n00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.680\nSo here's my, before we do that,\nlet's take a look at my lab layout.\n\n845\n00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.424\nNow remember, if you're following along\nin my book, everything I just showed you,\n\n846\n00:38:31.424 --> 00:38:34.347\nare all the figures and\ninformation out of my chapter six, right?\n\n847\n00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:34.996\nThis is where we're at.\n\n848\n00:38:34.996 --> 00:38:38.060\nAll right, so lab layout.\n\n849\n00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.210\nNow, this is gonna change slightly,\nbecause I'm using a different pod than\n\n850\n00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.540\nwhat I used for my book, but\nI mean I have the same routers.\n\n851\n00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.710\nThe only thing I changed is maybe\nthe interfaces, we'll take a look here.\n\n852\n00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.280\nActually I think they might be the same.\n\n853\n00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.350\nWe're gonna find out.\n\n854\n00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.540\nSo we have, here's what I'm gonna do guys.\n\n855\n00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.290\nAt lammle.com/ccna we'll have\nthe practice questions, and\n\n856\n00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.550\nI have some other downloads.\n\n857\n00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.152\nFree simulators and stuff like that.\n\n858\n00:38:58.152 --> 00:39:00.790\nI'm gonna put these figures up there for\nyou as well,\n\n859\n00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.270\neven though this is in my book.\n\n860\n00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.730\nBut that way you can just print it out or\nsomething and follow along and\n\n861\n00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.030\nbuild this lab and then follow along\nwith my book and these videos, okay?\n\n862\n00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.550\nSounds like fun, everyone should do it.\n\n863\n00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:12.810\nAll right, so,\nnotice we have just three routers.\n\n864\n00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:16.010\nThis is my corporate network with\nthe 10.10.10.1 network down here.\n\n865\n00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.931\nI have, now you guys\nare subnetting masters right now.\n\n866\n00:39:18.931 --> 00:39:21.311\nSo what subnet is this\nWAN link in right here.\n\n867\n00:39:23.772 --> 00:39:25.280\nCan you see that?\n\n868\n00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.710\nHe's looking over here.\n\n869\n00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.450\n>> Zero.\n\n870\n00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.723\n>> It is in the zero subnet.\n\n871\n00:39:28.723 --> 00:39:31.207\n172.16, see this guy, he's good, man.\n\n872\n00:39:31.207 --> 00:39:33.220\n172.16.10.0.\n\n873\n00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.400\nThis guy's in the 172.16.10.4, all right?\n\n874\n00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.088\nAnd then we have our LANs up here.\n\n875\n00:39:38.088 --> 00:39:38.630\n192.168.10.0 and 20.0.\n\n876\n00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:43.600\nPretty simple, pretty straightforward,\nbut we're gonna be able to do\n\n877\n00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.060\na lot with this because I actually\nhave another WAN link in between here.\n\n878\n00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.270\nSo we can do our multiline PPP and\nstuff like that.\n\n879\n00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.530\nSo lots of great stuff.\n\n880\n00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.380\nWe can do multi-area OSPF, or EIGRP.\n\n881\n00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.446\nLots of stuff, not to complicated\nof a layout, that was my idea.\n\n882\n00:39:56.446 --> 00:40:01.560\n10 network down here, 172.16s,\n0 and .4 on my WANs, 192.168.\n\n883\n00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.882\nLet's run over here.\n\n884\n00:40:03.882 --> 00:40:09.450\nI'm gonna hand you this, to do this,\nbut why don't we break this up?\n\n885\n00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.200\n>> Alright, what we're going\nto do right now, is go and\n\n886\n00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.060\ntake a break before Todd goes ahead and\nbrings us into the lab configuration.\n\n887\n00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.585\nWhat we've actually taken look at\nhere of course is just the basic\n\n888\n00:40:19.585 --> 00:40:21.389\nunderstanding of the Cisco iOS.\n\n889\n00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:23.682\nUnderstanding some of the different\ncomponents that we have to\n\n890\n00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:24.860\nactually be aware of.\n\n891\n00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:30.210\nAnd also the basic commands to get\na router or a switch setup for operations.\n\n892\n00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:34.210\nLearning how of course to actually build\nthe interfaces as well as the passwords\n\n893\n00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:35.840\nand some of the details behind that.\n\n894\n00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.330\nAll that's actually gonna be good\nknowledge that we're gonna actually also\n\n895\n00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.790\napply into the lab as well.\n\n896\n00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.070\nBut, that's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode done.\n\n897\n00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.840\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Ronny Wang.\n\n898\n00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.658\n>> All right, Todd Langley.\n\n899\n00:40:48.658 --> 00:40:53.104\n>> And we'll see you next time for\nmore CCENT.\n\n",

series,\n\n3\n00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:20.406\nwe've already talked a lot about\nthe different concepts here, but now,\n\n4\n00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.070\nactually, Todd is gonna\nbring us through a lab.\n\n5\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800\nSo, Todd, welcome back.\n\n6\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.720\n>> Excellent.\nLet's\n\n7\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.230\ntake off from where we just left off.\n\n8\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.860\nAnd I had some people\nin the chat screen and\n\n9\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.670\nthey were asking is this for\nthe new season?\n\n10\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.280\nYes.\n\n11\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.400\nWe are here for the latest and greatest\nnew Cisco CCNA Certs ICND 1 and 2.\n\n12\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.220\nWe're on the ICND 1 right now.\n\n13\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.450\nNext week we'll be in the ICND 2,\nso stick around.\n\n14\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.800\nSo where we're at right now guys is\nwe just did an introduction to iOS.\n\n15\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.630\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nconfigure my lab.\n\n16\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.280\nI showed you the lab at the end.\n\n17\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.400\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my layout here.\n\n18\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.010\nAnd kinda hard to see.\n\n19\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.370\nBut basically I have three connections,\nthree Telnets into the three routers.\n\n20\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.500\nAnd I actually consoled in to\nTelnet into my access server and\n\n21\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.450\nthen consoled to reverse Telnet it in.\n\n22\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.350\nBut so here's the court now.\n\n23\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310\nI already set the host name, guys, because\nremember I was just telling you I was\n\n24\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.660\nout of the customer like hey,\nthey don't have a host name.\n\n25\n00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.540\nHow do you know where you're at?\n\n26\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.400\nSo now that I was in here, but\nI'm gonna start at the beginning here.\n\n27\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.680\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n28\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.260\nSo here I am, if you remember\nthe figure that I just showed you and\n\n29\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.560\nwe'll show you again,\nagain it's in my book.\n\n30\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.450\nMy old book and the new one.\n\n31\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.590\nI'm using the same network layout.\n\n32\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.210\nSo from here I'm going to say Global,\nI'm here so\n\n33\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.550\nactually if I go all the way out here.\n\n34\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.520\nSo, I'm plugging in, I get into\nthe router, I'm gonna press Enter.\n\n35\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.180\nI end up in user mode so I will type\nenable and I end up in privileged mode.\n\n36\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.270\nI can type X to get out or end.\n\n37\n00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.020\nWhatever.\n\n38\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.340\nBut in this case here,\nI need to set a lot of things.\n\n39\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.020\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart from the beginning, config T.\n\n40\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.660\nNow, there's a lot of things that I do,\nthat I'm gonna show you,\n\n41\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.870\nthat are hints that I\ndo as an administrator,\n\n42\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.650\nthat because to fix annoying\nfeatures of the IOS, right?\n\n43\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.750\nI call them features cuz\nthey're documented, right?\n\n44\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.648\nInstead of a bug, now they're a feature.\n\n45\n00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:01.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n46\n00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.780\nthat being said, the first thing\nI'm going to show you say \"no IP\".\n\n47\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.030\nNow I did not even talk about\nthis in the last chapter.\n\n48\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.180\nDomain- lookup.\n\n49\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.840\nWhoops.\nOr it is just space lookup.\n\n50\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.580\nBoth of them work.\n\n51\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.200\nI am going to show you what that means and\nthere is a reason I type this in.\n\n52\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.500\nIt is something you will\nget used to as well.\n\n53\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.710\nNow that being said, the first thing\nwe went through was the hostname\n\n54\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.940\nIn this case I'm just gonna name it Corp,\nthe same thing.\n\n55\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.490\nBut I had named it earlier so\nwhen I came in, we knew where we were.\n\n56\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.210\nBut in this case here,\nI'm naming this one,\n\n57\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.470\nthis one's Corp in there, and I need\nto be able to look at my interfaces so\n\n58\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.690\nI can figure out which ones I have,\nwhich one the post test found.\n\n59\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.460\nRight, so,\nin this case here what else do we do?\n\n60\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.960\nSo we can go ahead and set our passwords.\n\n61\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.250\nSo let's do a show run.\n\n62\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.980\nLet's see what we got in the sense\nof passwords and stuff cuz I didn't.\n\n63\n00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.900\nWhoops, so\nI can't do it from within config, but\n\n64\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.420\nthere is a command that allows\nyou to do show commands.\n\n65\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.970\nSo every operating system from every\nother vendor just lets you type.\n\n66\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.600\nThe asa's let you type,\nthe nexus let you type, and so\n\n67\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.480\nI've just been doing a lot of asa style so\nI've started typing without thinking with\n\n68\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.390\nthe i west to do a show command within a\nconfig command, you have to start with do.\n\n69\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.390\nDo show run is going to show me my running\nconfig, I'm going to hit the tab key and\n\n70\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.390\nnotice it doesn't finish\nin typing the command for\n\n71\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.480\nme because I'm in Do on the do command,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.240\nSo set up the whole thing nice.\n\n73\n00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.270\nThank you, Cisco.\n\n74\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.460\nAll right, so I'm gonna come through,\nwe're gonna skip through some of the stuff\n\n75\n00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.340\nright here that I put in here, I'm gonna\nget right down here to the bottom.\n\n76\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.530\nLine con 0, so I just space barred\nthrough all the way down to the bottom.\n\n77\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.960\nNot much config in here.\n\n78\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.510\nLine con 0, line auxiliary 0.\n\n79\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.610\nRight, and there's my vty.\n\n80\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.330\nNow I can see at this point\nit only shows me four but\n\n81\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.710\nwe'll take a look at that with\na question mark, as I told you.\n\n82\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.350\nSo let's set our passwords first.\n\n83\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.740\nI'm in global configure.\n\n84\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.170\nSo now I'm going to say line, and\n\n85\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.470\nat this point here we can take\na look at our different lines.\n\n86\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.730\nWe have auxiliary, console, notice\nthere's a lot of line numbers showing up.\n\n87\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.180\nOn here right but\nthese other ones we won't really use so\n\n88\n00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.410\nwe'll just use my auxiliary and console so\ncoming up here I want my console set so\n\n89\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.700\nwhen I press enter and I plugin my\nconsole I now have a password so\n\n90\n00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.300\nline con 0 my prompt is\ngonna change to what?\n\n91\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.850\nConfig line.\n\n92\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.520\nWhich line?\n\n93\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.375\nI don't know.\n\n94\n00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:19.330\n[LAUGH] Password I'm gonna them\nsimple Password console, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.370\nAm I done?\n\n96\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.720\nIf I go out, isn't there a third step?\n\n97\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.695\n>> Gotta have login.\n\n98\n00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:24.950\n>> Yeah, login in this case.\n\n99\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.210\nThere's other commands I'm going to type\nin login local for a local database and\n\n100\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.900\nso on.\n\n101\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.930\nIn this case here, and I'm saying look\nunder the running config file for\n\n102\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.810\nthe password.\n\n103\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.390\nNow I also have an auxiliary password,\nline aux 0,\n\n104\n00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.960\npassword aux Log in.\n\n105\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.470\nSo now I've set you know the two\nroles that I have in there that I can\n\n106\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.980\nget in there with.\n\n107\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.340\nNow that I have a password\nto get into user mode.\n\n108\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.070\nBut I need to set my vg wise.\n\n109\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.390\nNow, I did tell you this.\n\n110\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.280\nWatch this.\n\n111\n00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.700\nUse your password question mark\nto find the last line number.\n\n112\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.800\nWatch what happens when I do that.\n\n113\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.520\nWell I told you to do this but\nit gives you an error it doesn't work.\n\n114\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.740\nIt's true.\nIt doesn't work from here, so for\n\n115\n00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.280\nsome reason, you have to exit here,\nand then say line VTY 0?\n\n116\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.170\nAnd I actually have 988 lines here.\n\n117\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.760\n>> Nice.\n\n118\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.950\n>> So, now it’s a good thing\n>> I check, isn't it.\n\n119\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.920\nSo I'm gonna type 988, notice I didn't\npress enter as then the question mark\n\n120\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.850\nless show me and now I'm picking\nall the line number aren't I?\n\n121\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.560\nOkay and then we'll say password\n\n122\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.760\ncuz we're gonna see in telnet right\nnow until the next episode, telnet and\n\n123\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.300\nthen even though logins are by\ndefault I'm gonna type it anyways.\n\n124\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.390\nSo I'm gonna do Ctrl+Z.\n\n125\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.380\nYou can type in exit a couple times.\n\n126\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.394\nI'm gonna do Ctrl+Z.\n\n127\n00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:44.446\n[COUGH]\nShow run, so I can do show run from here.\n\n128\n00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:45.419\nHold on.\n\n129\n00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.169\nLet me go down to the bottom again.\n\n130\n00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.630\nAnd now I can see this.\n\n131\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.350\nNow check this out.\n\n132\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.940\nAnd I'm not sure on this router why it's\ntransport input all, this is terrible.\n\n133\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.050\nWe'll talk about about\nthat in the next episode.\n\n134\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.600\nBut on this here, here's my console.\n\n135\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.710\nI'm seeing my passwords.\n\n136\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.680\nAnd here's my telnet.\n\n137\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.770\nNow telnet, or the VC lines, have a\ndefault five passwords zero through four.\n\n138\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.900\nRight, and then they extend\nthe lines five though 988.\n\n139\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.140\nSo you need to set them\nall if you want telnet in.\n\n140\n00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.400\nAll right, VTY, I think, usually comes\nin at like 322 or something like that,\n\n141\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.810\na pretty standard line.\n\n142\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.100\nOkay, now, on something like this,\nwe're going to go ahead, and\n\n143\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.470\nnow that we have our password set,\nwe have our host name set,\n\n144\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.680\nbut we need our banner and\nour interface descriptions, right?\n\n145\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.988\nSo I'm going to say, down here.\n\n146\n00:06:35.988 --> 00:06:40.401\nConfig t,\n\n147\n00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:46.530\nbanner motd, message of the day.\n\n148\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.580\nNow I need a spacebar.\n\n149\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.300\nI mean a space, not a spacebar,\nhe’s talking to me.\n\n150\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.980\nMeans put my thumb on the spacebar.\n\n151\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.992\nNow, this is going to give me what's\ncalled a deliminating character,\n\n152\n00:06:57.992 --> 00:07:00.170\n#banner motd# in this case.\n\n153\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.320\nNow, you can use any character you want,\nany character whatsoever.\n\n154\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.720\nThe fact is is,\nwhatever character I choose here,\n\n155\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.990\nwhenever the router sees that next,\nthat means your message is done.\n\n156\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.870\nSo if you use, like, an A,\n\n157\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.230\nthen you would never be able to\nuse an A in your message, right.\n\n158\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.544\nSo then I'm gonna do, space, now,\nif I don't put a space right here,\n\n159\n00:07:15.544 --> 00:07:19.920\nthen your delimiting character\nby default becomes an m.\n\n160\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.960\nOkay, just so you know, so if I was to\ntype in, this is my, my message would\n\n161\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.690\nstop if I didn't have a space right here,\nbecause my delimiting character was an m.\n\n162\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.990\nIt'll say, your message is over.\n\n163\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.460\nThis would say, this is m.\n\n164\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.900\nAll right, this is my Corp router, okay?\n\n165\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.780\nPound sign.\n\n166\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.860\nNow there's a couple different ways,\nso end a delimiting character.\n\n167\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.010\nAnd there it is.\n\n168\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.356\nThere's another way to do this,\nI could say, check this out,\n\n169\n00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:50.374\nbanner motd,\nI'm getting a little delayed in my pounds,\n\n170\n00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:53.661\nthe eliminating character,\nand press enter.\n\n171\n00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:57.546\nNow, the reason I would do this,\ni can paste in a whole line.\n\n172\n00:07:57.546 --> 00:08:02.823\nThis is ACME, and stay out and this whole\nparagraph under paragraph All right,\n\n173\n00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:07.730\nand so if you want to do more than one\nline, that is how you would do it.\n\n174\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.610\n>> Todd, can I get you to hit\nenter a couple of times, and\n\n175\n00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.160\nthat way everybody can see\nwhat you're typing in there?\n\n176\n00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.250\nThere you go, excellent, thank you.\n\n177\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.020\n>> Yeah, it was underneath\nthe little picture right there.\n\n178\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.120\n>> Yeah, just behind your head.\n\n179\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.210\nJust a little bit.\n\n180\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.380\n>> All right, so I'll keep that up there.\n\n181\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.520\nNow so we set our host name.\n\n182\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.100\nWe already set our passwords.\n\n183\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.220\nNow we set our banner, and the last\nthing was our interface descriptions.\n\n184\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.650\n>> Right.\n>> Interface descriptions.\n\n185\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.980\nThen we'll go back, do some lecture\non interfaces, and so on, and\n\n186\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.030\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n187\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.520\nSo in this case here,\nI want to do my interface description.\n\n188\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.820\nSo check this out,\nthere's a couple ways to do it, but\n\n189\n00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.170\nin this case here I'm going to\nsay interface question mark.\n\n190\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.250\nLet's see what we go.\n\n191\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.501\nWell, we don't have all that,\nI'll tell you that.\n\n192\n00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:49.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So most of these,\n\n193\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.240\nthere's hardly any physical ones here,\nmost of these are virtual.\n\n194\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.910\nAll right?\n\n195\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.940\nWell, let's look for,\nthere it is, FastEthernet,\n\n196\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.420\nI was kind of looking for gigabit.\n\n197\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.770\nBut in this, I have FastEthernet.\n\n198\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.640\nSo let's do our LANs, right?\n\n199\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.030\nI know that my LAN's on my corporate, I\nonly have the one going to the ten ten ten\n\n200\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.470\nnetwork, I'm looking down at my drawing,\nwhich you guys can easily get.\n\n201\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.950\nInterface f0/0, that's always my first\none so let's just use that one, and\n\n202\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:19.070\nI'm going to say description\nconnection to corp LAN.\n\n203\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.030\nCan you guys see that?\n\n204\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.710\nOkay.\n\n205\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.400\nSo I'll press enter a few times.\n\n206\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.720\nAnd now I add my description here,\non my core LAN, that's all I have.\n\n207\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.650\nBut I do have some interface serials.\n\n208\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.950\nOkay?\nSo I'm going to type exit here.\n\n209\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.276\nInterface S, looks like 00.\n\n210\n00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.730\nNow I'm going to do a slash 0, and we're\ngoing to talk about what this interface\n\n211\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.386\nhere is in a minute, and\nwhat that slash means in a second.\n\n212\n00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:45.960\nBut I'm going to do a question mark\nhere to see if I've finished typing\n\n213\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.992\nthe interface, and it says that I haven't.\n\n214\n00:09:47.992 --> 00:09:51.560\nIt doesn't say enter or anything, but it\ndoes give me a slash, meaning that it has\n\n215\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.196\nanother character, and again, we will\ndescribe this in detail in a second.\n\n216\n00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:59.380\nSo I'm going to do a slash zero,\nthat's probably my first interface, and\n\n217\n00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.830\nI'm going to guess that's\ngoing to my San Francisco, and\n\n218\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.140\nif I'm wrong, I have commands that will\nshow me and help me draw up my network.\n\n219\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.180\nSo just stay tuned, okay?\n\n220\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.420\nI'm going to say description and use my\ntab key to finish typing the command.\n\n221\n00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.970\nAnd this is wan, to San Fransisco.\n\n222\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.780\nSo in the drawing, that's what it is,\na wan to San Francisco, it is a wan, okay?\n\n223\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.594\nAnd then my other ones are probably going\nto be interface S 0 /1/0 because it's\n\n224\n00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:27.710\na different slot.\n\n225\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.406\nI remember to put the card in a slot,\n\n226\n00:10:29.406 --> 00:10:32.850\nit's helpful when you actually\nbuild it physically by hand.\n\n227\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.210\nSo, it's in the different slot 1, right?\n\n228\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.939\nSo I'm going to press zero, and I'm\ngoing to up arrow a couple of times and\n\n229\n00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:39.030\nthen I display that.\n\n230\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.860\nAnd then I'm going to backspace and\nsay description WAN to looks like LA.\n\n231\n00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.130\nI am now done with my\nadministrative functions.\n\n232\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.170\nI did a host name, we did our banner,\n\n233\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.670\nwe did all our passwords\ndid we do enable secret?\n\n234\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.380\nWe didn't do enable secret.\n\n235\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.280\n>> We didn't do enable secret.\n>> There we go,\n\n236\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.110\ngood thing he's here, right?\n\n237\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.950\nSo we would have found that out real\nquick when we tried to log back in.\n\n238\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.970\nBut the fact is,\nis what should I type in here?\n\n239\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.010\nOkay, so I've got my, all my lying\npasswords, all my user-mo passwords.\n\n240\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.190\nMy lying counts to zero, my auxiliary, my.\n\n241\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.910\nSo what about enable password?\n\n242\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.140\nTodd, because that's what it shouldl be.\n\n243\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.840\nHow about that?\nIs that going to work?\n\n244\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.030\nIs that good enough?\n\n245\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.530\n>> No.\n>> No.\n\n246\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.460\nOkay, what should we do?\n\n247\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:30.160\n>> We should do an enable secret, and\n\n248\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.460\nwhat should we put?\n\n249\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.990\n>> Lannle, of course.\n\n250\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.153\n>> There we go, of course.\n\n251\n00:11:34.153 --> 00:11:34.953\n[LAUGH] All right?\n\n252\n00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:37.530\nAnd I'm going to show you, what we'll\ndo is we'll go to the running config,\n\n253\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.270\ncopy that and paste it into Google and\nget the answer.\n\n254\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.930\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nverify, what I did.\n\n255\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.990\nI had some guys, I do have some other\nconfigs that I was playing with before\n\n256\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.330\nI started this section.\n\n257\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.530\nShow run,\nhit my tab key to see the whole thing.\n\n258\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.330\nIf you have nothing to\ndo it will kind of work.\n\n259\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.180\nAll right, so\nwe're going to come through here.\n\n260\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.670\nNotice here I have my enable secret,\nthat's encrypted by default.\n\n261\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.170\nThis is a heavier one in the 15 code,\n\n262\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.590\nwe've got enable secret\nprivilege level four.\n\n263\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.880\nThat's going to give us a little\nbit more encryption here.\n\n264\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.070\nEnable password Todd.\n\n265\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.890\nNotice my password, and I don't\nreally ever use this in production.\n\n266\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.960\nThe reason that I'm showing you this is\njust so you can see that it's unencrypted,\n\n267\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.712\nand enable secret is going\nto supersede this one here.\n\n268\n00:12:19.712 --> 00:12:24.890\nAll right, so the other thing is we\nhad our banners and our passwords.\n\n269\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.910\nThere's my no IP domain lookout,\nwe will figure out what that means.\n\n270\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.700\nThere's my interfaces, so I know I have\nIP's on here, we haven't talked about that\n\n271\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.450\nyet is fine but\nwe can see our descriptions there, right?\n\n272\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.420\nAnd we can see there's WAN San Francisco,\nright?\n\n273\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.190\nAnd so on.\n\n274\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.870\nAnd then we have our console auxiliary,\nand\n\n275\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.880\nthe other thing we didn't\ndo was our encryption.\n\n276\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.560\n>> Right, so the password.\n\n277\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.620\n>> So I need to encrypt these.\n\n278\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.110\nSo notice as I went through here that I\nnotice my problem, so how do I do that?\n\n279\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.790\nI just can't remember.\n\n280\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.890\n>> Go to our global configuration mode.\n\n281\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.216\n>> Okay.\n>> And then we do Service\n\n282\n00:12:58.216 --> 00:13:04.164\n>> Password, dash encryption.\n\n283\n00:13:04.164 --> 00:13:07.320\n>> Oops, it helps if I hit\n>> Service,\n\n284\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.260\nI think it's service\npassword dash encryption.\n\n285\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.990\nI don't think we have there,\nI could be wrong.\n\n286\n00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.020\nNo, I'm right.\n>> I had the dash in the wrong place.\n\n287\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.570\nService password encryption, all right, so\n\n288\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.530\nI usually just do service pass but in\nthis case here I'm just gonna hit enter.\n\n289\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.450\nAnd check this out, so\nI'm going to do do show run.\n\n290\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.680\nGo down to the bottom,\n\n291\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.700\nwell, we should have seen the top, but we\ncan see these are, here's my console, and\n\n292\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.020\nso these are seven, so\nthese can easily crash, right?\n\n293\n00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.900\nHere's my VTY passwords And my VTY right?\n\n294\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.190\nSo I have two levels of VTY and at\nthe top we would have seen the other one.\n\n295\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.060\nSo let's go back guys and take a look.\n\n296\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.370\nWhy don't you grab me that cable?\n\n297\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.810\nWhy don't we go back and take a look and\ngo through a couple of verification\n\n298\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.860\ncommands, how to configure the interfaces,\nwhat does that serial zero zero zero.\n\n299\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.050\nSerial 10 mean that I typed in\nthe slashes and so on, okay?\n\n300\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.570\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n301\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.090\nAll right, so here was the lab\nthat we were looking at here.\n\n302\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.410\nSo here was my corporate\nnetwork down here.\n\n303\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.560\nAnd my F zero zero,\nthese are a little bit different.\n\n304\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.540\nThat's zero zero, and\nthat's zero, the one zero.\n\n305\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.750\nRight?\nBut these are probably the same up here.\n\n306\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.460\nAnd then we had our connections.\n\n307\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.990\nSo, in reality,\nall I did was a corp router.\n\n308\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.790\nI did the host names, banners, passwords,\ninterface descriptions, we encrypted our\n\n309\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.530\npasswords, and we didn't forget to do\nour enable secret password either.\n\n310\n00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.420\nAnd we noticed that it had a better\nencryption on it this time, didn't we?\n\n311\n00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.080\nSo let's go back, whoops, I don't\nwant to go there, I want to go here.\n\n312\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.320\nLet's talk about adding addresses on\nour modular routers here like the 1900.\n\n313\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.240\nSo from global config,\nwe can see that this is, now, initially,\n\n314\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:50.170\nwhat these are is slot/subslot/port.\n\n315\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:50.830\nRight?\n\n316\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.560\nSlots, sub, slotport.\n\n317\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.270\nAnd what that means, so\nwe'd be in slot zero.\n\n318\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.336\nAnd if we and\nsome kind of card that had slots in again,\n\n319\n00:14:58.336 --> 00:15:02.645\nlike there are some cards [INAUDIBLE] so\non that have those in there.\n\n320\n00:15:02.645 --> 00:15:06.780\nNow, if we are not using them,\nzero moves over here, the slot moves here.\n\n321\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.190\nSo my serials were really 0/0 and\n1/0, but the 0,\n\n322\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:14.750\nthe first one's now a placeholder\nbecause we're not using that second one.\n\n323\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.850\nSo it would be 0/0, so\nwe just do it like that, right.\n\n324\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.980\nSo I know that by using\nthe V.35 cards that I am,\n\n325\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.610\nI had them in two different slots.\n\n326\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.310\nSo they're in slots 0 and 1.\n\n327\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.230\nSo now I put the IP address in there.\n\n328\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.950\nIt would be really nice to add\nan IP address to an interface and\n\n329\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.160\nnot have to put the mask.\n\n330\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.545\nPut the slash notation,\nbut that's not available.\n\n331\n00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:38.170\n11.1.1.2/24.\nInterface fast,\n\n332\n00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.840\nethernet 0/0 or gigs 0/0, whatever it is.\n\n333\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.620\nChoose the interface.\n\n334\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.410\nNotice, okay, I did not type\nout the full interfaces here.\n\n335\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.165\nYou don't have to do that for\nthe exam objectives or anything else.\n\n336\n00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:50.090\nAnd I did up here on top.\n\n337\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.273\nNotice that the one thing is that\nthese have to be in separate subnets.\n\n338\n00:15:53.273 --> 00:15:56.365\nTwo interfaces on the same router\ncannot be in the same subnet.\n\n339\n00:15:56.365 --> 00:16:00.660\nIf you do, you'll get an overlaps with so\nand so interface.\n\n340\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.749\nNow in serial line clocking remember\nwe're using our serial interfaces.\n\n341\n00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:05.562\nWe don't have a lot of\nthis in production but\n\n342\n00:16:05.562 --> 00:16:07.480\nit's still part of\nthe objectives slightly.\n\n343\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.150\nI don't spend a lot of time on it\nyou still have to understand it.\n\n344\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.460\nFirst off we have our CSUDSU.\n\n345\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:17.960\nso this provides our clocking of\nthe line to our DTE which is our router.\n\n346\n00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.510\nSo this is my DTE network here.\n\n347\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.810\nThis is considered the DCE.\n\n348\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.670\nNow the reason I bring this up,\nif you're not in production,\n\n349\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.600\nthen you're going to typically have to add\nsome sort of clocking in here, right, so\n\n350\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.890\nCisco has that capability of saying\nwe're gonna add clocking from a router.\n\n351\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.670\nAll right, so this is a typical,\nlet's say a T3 or something like that,\n\n352\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.820\nit's possible, and you would see something\nlike this and you have a CSUDSU.\n\n353\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.310\nHowever, they usually are not external,\nthey're usually inside\n\n354\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.890\none of the slots I showed you at the\nbeginning of the section, in that card.\n\n355\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.630\nNow, in this case, here, we're gonna buy\ncable, about 50 bucks off the internet,\n\n356\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.790\nit's kind of a LAN crossover cable for\nrouters.\n\n357\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.910\nAnd for Cisco there's specific ones.\n\n358\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.600\nNotice here, this is I'm here,\nI'm in the Todd router here\n\n359\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.860\nserial 000 and setting the clock\nrate because on this end its DCE.\n\n360\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.180\nLet me run over here for a second, I'm\ngonna come here and I'm gonna go here and\n\n361\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.190\nI'm gonna type something in and that's\nthe command to see the clock rate right?\n\n362\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:16.690\nShow controllers.\n\n363\n00:17:20.342 --> 00:17:21.340\nOkay.\n\n364\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.820\nSo you have to type enough\nto hit your spacebar.\n\n365\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.520\nShow controllers now, don't ever press\nenter here because you're gonna get so\n\n366\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.950\nmuch stuff, you're not gonna understand.\n\n367\n00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:35.318\nSo I know my first one is serial 0/0/0,\nright?\n\n368\n00:17:35.318 --> 00:17:36.420\nOkay.\n\n369\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.840\nOkay, so at the top here, check this out.\n\n370\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.120\nWhat's that say?\n\n371\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.190\nDCE V dot 35 clock rate 2 million,\nso I'm a DC, can you see that?\n\n372\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.490\nI'm a DCE interface.\n\n373\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.440\nNow, you won't see this in production.\n\n374\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.550\nThis is a non-production,\nmaybe test environment or\n\n375\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.410\nyour home environment you're\ngonna see that you're not DTE.\n\n376\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.760\nA router is typically a DTE,\nand this is a DCE so\n\n377\n00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.030\nI'd have to add clock rate,\nwhich is what I did over here right?\n\n378\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.610\nAdded the clock rate 2 million.\n\n379\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.730\nYou can see that with\nthe show controllers command.\n\n380\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.020\nNow remember, don't type show\ncontrollers and press enter and\n\n381\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.690\nshow controller interface name.\n\n382\n00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.760\nThe other command that you can\nuse is the bandwidth command.\n\n383\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.640\nWhen we get to OSPF,\nI will discuss this bandwidth command.\n\n384\n00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.560\nThe reason that you would use this\nbandwidth command is if I had multiple\n\n385\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.340\nconnections between two routers.\n\n386\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.500\nSo this network up here that you guys\ncannot see, this network up here, right,\n\n387\n00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.040\nfrom down here,\nI have two paths to get there.\n\n388\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.670\nWhich one's better?\n\n389\n00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.500\nI have to tell the routing protocol\nbecause the routing protocol by\n\n390\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.120\ndefault will think they're equal and\nloan balance by default.\n\n391\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.220\nThat's the default.\n\n392\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.110\nSo the bandwidth command allows me to\ntell writing protocol, such as OSPF,\n\n393\n00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.510\nwhich one is a better\nvariable if that is the case.\n\n394\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.260\nIf they aren't the same.\n\n395\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.340\nNow to enable an interface all right,\n\n396\n00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.080\nwe're gonna do the shut down\nto disable the interface.\n\n397\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.380\nAll right.\nSo it's shut down to disable it.\n\n398\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.130\nAnd there's times that you'd want to\ndo that to kind of reset the interface.\n\n399\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.160\nWe used to do that on WANs a lot.\n\n400\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.800\nYou don't see that problem necessarily\non resetting a LAN link, but\n\n401\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.100\non WANs we certainly did.\n\n402\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.850\nBut really what we pay attention to\non a router is the no shut command.\n\n403\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.590\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at that now.\n\n404\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.370\nSo I'm gonna cut out of here.\n\n405\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.850\nAnd I've used, I'm gonna say config t,\ninterface F 00, and no shot.\n\n406\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.510\nNow, we would typically see it pop up and\nsay, F 00 is now enabled.\n\n407\n00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.180\nThat's my sys log coming up.\n\n408\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.630\nWe're not seeing that cuz I had\nalready brought up my interfaces.\n\n409\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.250\nBut nonetheless, you have to come in and\nactually [COUGH], excuse me.\n\n410\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.060\nThe full command, no shutdown, right?\n\n411\n00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.790\nThat's my full command,\nif that matters to you.\n\n412\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.280\nI need to do that on every\ninterface on a router.\n\n413\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.590\nIt's important to remember that\nevery router interface is shut down,\n\n414\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.970\nall switch interfaces are enabled\nby default right out of the box.\n\n415\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.270\nAnd the reason that is, if you take a\nswitch out of the box, you put it in, and\n\n416\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.150\nis your network better?\n\n417\n00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.930\nSure it is.\n\n418\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.900\nAnd it just works by default.\n\n419\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.640\nShould you administrate and\ndo some other stuff?\n\n420\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.310\nSure.\n\n421\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.420\nBut in the meantime, it's up and running.\n\n422\n00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.060\nOkay?\n\n423\n00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.470\nSo we've got this going on.\n\n424\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.820\nWe enable our interfaces.\n\n425\n00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.820\nLet's see what else we got.\n\n426\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.700\nNow this one's good here, let's take\na look at our serial interfaces here.\n\n427\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.090\nLet's talk about these.\n\n428\n00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.470\nShow interface serial 000, that's fine.\n\n429\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.030\nNotice this says up and up, and\nlet's go into detail about that.\n\n430\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:29.360\nThis is a real good,\nnice exam objective here.\n\n431\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.540\nWe're gonna come back to those,\nspend more time on that up-and-up.\n\n432\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.400\nHere's my IP address.\n\n433\n00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.820\nNotice it displays it in a slash format.\n\n434\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.700\nNow, if you wanna have some\nfun with your friends,\n\n435\n00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.280\nwhich I always do at work,\nyou can go under the interface and\n\n436\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.590\nuse the netmask command and\nput this into hexidecimal.\n\n437\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.930\nThat'll really throw a wrench in your\nday for your friends, wouldn't it?\n\n438\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.650\nSo, we can this displayed in max.\n\n439\n00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:55.470\nAll right, anyways, internet address\n11.1.1.2/24, can't type it in like that.\n\n440\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.900\nThe maximum transmission, you know,\n\n441\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.430\nlet me ask you guys a question,\nseize an objective right here.\n\n442\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.910\nWhat the heck does MTU 1500 bytes mean?\n\n443\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.810\n1500 bytes of what?\n\n444\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.510\nWell they give you three options.\n\n445\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.620\nThat sound good?\n\n446\n00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.310\nYou've got segments, sound familiar?\n\n447\n00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.208\nRight, from yesterday.\n\n448\n00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:15.455\nPackets.\n\n449\n00:21:15.455 --> 00:21:18.350\nAnd frames.\n\n450\n00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.500\n>> Be a frame.\n>> [LAUGH] Close.\n\n451\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.560\nLet's see.\nIf it is not,\n\n452\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.420\nyou still have a 50-50 chance now.\n\n453\n00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.200\nIt is packets.\n\n454\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.840\nThis is MTU 1500 byte packets\ncan go down this link.\n\n455\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.410\nBandwidth I changed it to 2000 Kilobytes.\n\n456\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.160\nNow, on a serial link on a Cisco router,\nyou'll see it as this.\n\n457\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.580\nIt thinks its a T one by default.\n\n458\n00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.170\nThat's a default on all\nCisco serial interfaces.\n\n459\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:46.870\nWhich is fine.\n\n460\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.360\nIf you only have one link to every\nremote location, does it matter?\n\n461\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.720\nNo, not in the least.\n\n462\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.620\nAll right, so that's our bandwidth.\n\n463\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.450\nReliability?\n\n464\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.810\n255 over 255 means 100% reliable.\n\n465\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.130\nThis link since you have\ndone a no-shut on it and\n\n466\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.340\nit has come up, is has been 100% reliable.\n\n467\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.790\nIf it would have said 125 over 255,\nIf they're 50% reliable.\n\n468\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.830\nWhat about no load?\n\n469\n00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.950\nLoad 125 over 255 means\nthat there is no load.\n\n470\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.880\nSo you might see this maybe at a two or\nthree.\n\n471\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.630\nThere are low priority threat,\n\n472\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.410\nI don't, even if your interface is really\nhigh processing, we might not see that.\n\n473\n00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.890\nEncapsulation HDLC,\nwe don't talk about this in the system,\n\n474\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.010\nthat's the Cisco default\nencapsulation On their serial links.\n\n475\n00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.660\nAll you need to know.\n\n476\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.520\nSo you have to have a Cisco router on\nthe other side of your WAN, right?\n\n477\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.600\nI can set a loop back and\nloop to my csudsu.\n\n478\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.130\nAnd the other thing right here is kind of\nimportant, this keepalive set 10 seconds.\n\n479\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.520\nThis is a layer to layer 2\nkeep alive to my neighbor.\n\n480\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.270\nAll right?\n\n481\n00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.900\nSo if I get this, it's up and up.\n\n482\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.560\nNow that's important that\nthis is the second up.\n\n483\n00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.870\nLet's take a look at that, what that\nmeans to us, and it's right here.\n\n484\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.990\nSerial 0 is up,\nline protocol is up, right?\n\n485\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.010\nThis is Carrier Detect, right?\n\n486\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.250\nThis is my physical layer, Carrier Detect.\n\n487\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.780\nSo that tells me I'm good locally.\n\n488\n00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.400\nNow, typically on a WAN link,\nyou're gonna be good here,\n\n489\n00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.680\ncuz this you CSU/DSU providing this for\nyou, so your link is gonna be up.\n\n490\n00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.560\nThe other one, the second up,\n\n491\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.000\nis because I'm getting keepalives at layer\ntwo from my neighbor every ten seconds.\n\n492\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.010\nSo if this slows down, where's my problem?\n\n493\n00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.390\nAnything past your CSU/DSU, right?\n\n494\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.940\nBut we know it's not you and this a\nobjective, they get things like this, and\n\n495\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.590\nsay hey, your serial0/0/0 is up,\nline protocol is down, what's the problem?\n\n496\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.290\nAnd I'm like, I don't know,\nlist 1000 things.\n\n497\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.400\nBut the thing is, what do you do when you\nget something like that on the objectives?\n\n498\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.460\nYou can take out the wrong answers,\neasily.\n\n499\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.330\nBecause let me ask you a question,\nis serial0/0/0 bad?\n\n500\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:46.880\nNo.\n\n501\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.230\nIs serial0/0/0 shut down?\n\n502\n00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.780\nNo.\n\n503\n00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.840\nIs there a bad cable in serial0/0/0\nconnecting [INAUDIBLE] issue No.\n\n504\n00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.213\nWhat are you left with?\n\n505\n00:23:53.213 --> 00:23:55.932\nThe correct answer cuz you took\nout all the wrong answers.\n\n506\n00:23:55.932 --> 00:23:58.391\nThat's how you have to\napproach something like this,\n\n507\n00:23:58.391 --> 00:23:59.895\nbecause the answer is who knows?\n\n508\n00:23:59.895 --> 00:24:01.194\nIt could be anything.\n\n509\n00:24:01.194 --> 00:24:04.976\nSo, one time I was out and I had to\nwait until Miami and it kept going down,\n\n510\n00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:08.138\nwell I called him one day and\nthey go in the closet it was gone,\n\n511\n00:24:08.138 --> 00:24:12.100\nsomeone stole the router,\nthat would make it down, don't you think?\n\n512\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.500\nThat's a true story to [LAUGH] I guess\nI'll have to tell you when I tell you,\n\n513\n00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.410\nmake something up.\n\n514\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.910\nAll right, anyways, a Serial0/0/0 is up,\nline protocol is up.\n\n515\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.200\nThis is, hold on guys, I wanna ask\nyou guys something, is this good?\n\n516\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.440\nThis is good here, right?\n\n517\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.000\n>> Right.\n>> Port operational,\n\n518\n00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.110\ncan I ping the other side?\n\n519\n00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.904\nI don't know, this is layer 1 and layer 2,\nI don't know anything about layer 3.\n\n520\n00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.590\nThis command, this up and up,\nis layer one and layer two.\n\n521\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.510\nNow you have to do commands to test and\nverify your layer three, but\n\n522\n00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.800\nthis isn't doing it for it for you.\n\n523\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.920\nSo all I want to make sure is,\nis that, is your network up and\n\n524\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.860\nrunning as you do this?\n\n525\n00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.100\nNow, your data link between you and\nyour neighbor is up.\n\n526\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.270\nThat's good, though, right?\n\n527\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.360\nNow here's what we want to do.\n\n528\n00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:50.860\nUp and down.\n\n529\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.620\nI don't know, someone stole the router?\n\n530\n00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.460\nP1's down?\n\n531\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.880\nIt's typically like your ISP is\nhaving a problem these days.\n\n532\n00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.440\nDown, down.\n\n533\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.610\nLayer one problem, run out to your router,\nbad interface, bad CSUD issue,\n\n534\n00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.420\nbad cable, something right?\n\n535\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:05.950\nSomething local.\n\n536\n00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.440\nNow administratively down,\nwas it a bad router?\n\n537\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.670\nTake it out of the verak, throw it away.\n\n538\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.470\n>> You turned it off.\n\n539\n00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.930\n>> You turn off the interface.\n\n540\n00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.480\n>> Interface.\n\n541\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.690\n>> Yes, the interface we did it.\n\n542\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.452\nWhat command?\n\n543\n00:25:16.452 --> 00:25:17.476\nShut-down.\n\n544\n00:25:17.476 --> 00:25:19.190\n>> Shut-down, very very good.\n\n545\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.170\nNow, a couple verification commands when\nwe finish up this section here guys,\n\n546\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.060\nwe're gonna go out and run these.\n\n547\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.440\nShow IP interface brief, great command.\n\n548\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.640\nLet me just run out there, and let me see.\n\n549\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.580\nShow IP interface brief,\nshow protocols, Show IP interface.\n\n550\n00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.620\nRight now, I'm going to show you\nguys these are CCENT objectives.\n\n551\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.980\nVery much so.\n\n552\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.070\nSo let me run right here.\n\n553\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.860\nI'm gonna just do Ctrl+Z, clear that out.\n\n554\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.080\nOkay, this is the command du jour.\n\n555\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.960\nThis is the command that I go\nto every time on a router.\n\n556\n00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.380\nand even on a switch to verify,\nmy interface is my configurations.\n\n557\n00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.370\nLet's take a look here.\n\n558\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.880\nShow IP, Int brief.\n\n559\n00:26:00.955 --> 00:26:06.178\nOkay, so first off, I can verify my IP\naddresses, my fast ethernet 00, and\n\n560\n00:26:06.178 --> 00:26:11.240\nit's up, and oop, I won't see the other\nend, so hold on let me bring this up\n\n561\n00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.510\nover here, Come on.\n\n562\n00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:21.400\nIt doesn't like that.Okay, good enough.\n\n563\n00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.310\nPassing the zero zero IP address.\n\n564\n00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.120\nYou know,\nI don't know what this okay means.\n\n565\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.790\nI have no clue.\n\n566\n00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.120\nI've seen that since 1990,\n\n567\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.890\ndoesn't matter if I have a bad interface\nthe times that I do, it always says okay.\n\n568\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.950\nFor 30 years now!\n\n569\n00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.910\nSo, whatever that means Method manual\nwhich means I statically set it.\n\n570\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.790\nIt could say unset.\n\n571\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.920\nSo the other things\nyou're gonna see is DHCP.\n\n572\n00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.180\nOr SLARP.\n\n573\n00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.095\nYou know what SLARP is?\n\n574\n00:26:42.095 --> 00:26:44.750\n[LAUGH] Serial Line ARP, right?\n\n575\n00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.050\nThis came out in 1990.\n\n576\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.570\nSo this has been around.\n\n577\n00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.250\nI'm really aging myself here.\n\n578\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.090\nThis came out a while ago for\nan auto-configuration cuz what it would do\n\n579\n00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:57.130\nIs if the determinant found care detect\non your serial interface, your interface?\n\n580\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.590\nIt would come up and\nsay, I'm a Cisco Router.\n\n581\n00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.710\nThere must be another Cisco\nrouter on the other side.\n\n582\n00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:03.460\nWhat else is there?\n\n583\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.540\nAnd it was kind of a true\nstatement at the time.\n\n584\n00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.050\nBut anyways they would send out this\nproprietary protocol called SLARP and\n\n585\n00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.900\nit would actually ask the other\nrouter if it was a Cisco Router,\n\n586\n00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.200\nwhat's your IP address.\n\n587\n00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.400\nIt would come back and\nsay it was 172.16.10.1,\n\n588\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.610\nit would automatically assign it\n172.16.10.2 the next one in the range.\n\n589\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.440\n>> Hm.\n>> Alright.\n\n590\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.190\nSo if you see it assigned by SLARP it's\nbecause you were connected to another\n\n591\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.644\nCisco router, you erased your config\ncompletely, and then reloaded it found and\n\n592\n00:27:29.644 --> 00:27:33.180\nit'll assign itself with SLARPI\nstill see that happen today.\n\n593\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.270\nAll right, notice I see my IP addresses,\nnow here's the problem with this command.\n\n594\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:43.250\nFirst off, I can see all of my interfaces\nfound with the post test, all right?\n\n595\n00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.180\nSo I even have a logical\ninterface that I've put in here,\n\n596\n00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.630\nwe're gonna go through all this.\n\n597\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.370\nAnd I can see my IPs, I can verify that.\n\n598\n00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.380\nI can see all my data links to my\nneighbors are good This is a great\n\n599\n00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.470\ncommand.\n\n600\n00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.010\nI can't see my mask, though.\n\n601\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:58.750\nI can't see my mask so I can't verify, you\nknow I have a typo with my subnet mask.\n\n602\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.570\nThat's when I use the show protocols.\n\n603\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.360\nSo you can see that.\n\n604\n00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.490\nShow protocols command.\n\n605\n00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.720\nShow IP interface brief is your first one.\n\n606\n00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.650\nShow protocols.\n\n607\n00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.930\nThis is kind of nice.\n\n608\n00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.270\nSo it says IP routing is enabled.\n\n609\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.310\nGood to know.\n\n610\n00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.300\nRight now if I had IPv6 enabled it would\nshow those under the interfaces as well.\n\n611\n00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.690\nThis is a great command because it\nsummarizes my IPs, the mask and\n\n612\n00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.850\nmy status of my layer one and layer two.\n\n613\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:32.370\nSo if I had IPv6 When I used to\nrun IP/IPX/AppleTalk/DECnet and\n\n614\n00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.560\nso on, it would show all my apps,\nwhich was a great way to get a summary\n\n615\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.860\nof all those different types\nof protocols under here.\n\n616\n00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.070\nIn this case here IP and\nIPv6 would show up.\n\n617\n00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:45.890\nSo it tells me FastEthernet is up and\nup, and my IP address and my mask.\n\n618\n00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:46.420\nRight?\n\n619\n00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.580\nSo this is good too.\n\n620\n00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.190\nShow IP interface brief is good, but show\nprotocols is a good command too, right?\n\n621\n00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.780\nMost people don't use this command.\n\n622\n00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.830\nIt's been around for a long time but\nshow protocols is good.\n\n623\n00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.710\nAnd then the other command, which one?\n\n624\n00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.210\nOkay, show IP interface,\nlet's talk about this.\n\n625\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.370\nNow, on this case here, the command,\n\n626\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.400\ninstead of show interface All right,\nwe talked about show interface.\n\n627\n00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:15.130\nYesterday we were looking for broadcast\nstorms and collisions and duplex errors.\n\n628\n00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.530\nBut in this case here,\n\n629\n00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:21.980\nshow IP, this is going to give me the\ndefault IP configuration of an interface.\n\n630\n00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.829\nShow IP interface, let's do f0/0.\n\n631\n00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:28.210\nLots of stuff here.\n\n632\n00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:29.270\nOops.\n\n633\n00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.160\nLet me try that again.\n\n634\n00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.490\nOkay?\n\n635\n00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.300\nSo here it is right here.\n\n636\n00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.370\nI can't go through all of it,\nbut it's up and up.\n\n637\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.880\nThis is good.\n\n638\n00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.760\nGives me IPs, so\nthis is a great way to see it too.\n\n639\n00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.820\nI like the summaries though.\n\n640\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.730\nShow IP interface brief,\nshow protocols, is great commands.\n\n641\n00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.150\nInternet address, /24.\n\n642\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.120\nMy MTU for my packets.\n\n643\n00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.120\nAnd if I use the setup\ncommand it would tell me.\n\n644\n00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.980\nHelper address,\nhaven't really talked about that.\n\n645\n00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.840\nThat's gonna be in the next episode.\n\n646\n00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.670\nHas to do with DHCP.\n\n647\n00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.620\nWe could do directed broadcast.\n\n648\n00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.300\nBut I wanna come down here, right here.\n\n649\n00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.020\nSee this right here?\n\n650\n00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.280\nIngoing and outgoing access list,\n\n651\n00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.950\nthis will tell you if an access\nlist set on the interface.\n\n652\n00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.120\nSome good stuff here.\n\n653\n00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.370\nShould tell me if our\nsplit horizon is enabled.\n\n654\n00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.860\nWhen we get to routing protocols\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n655\n00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.760\nBut there was some other stuff that was\non the objectives that I saw right here.\n\n656\n00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.120\nWhat command do you type in to see\nif fast switching is enabled or\n\n657\n00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.460\nCEF is enabled on the interface?\n\n658\n00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.900\nAll right, this has to do with routing.\n\n659\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.880\nAnd right here it says IP fast\nswitching and the only way to see that,\n\n660\n00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.700\nshow IP interface, right?\n\n661\n00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.970\nSo now if you go to the corp and\nI do show IP int brief.\n\n662\n00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.350\nAgain, I really like this command.\n\n663\n00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.470\nBecause, I keep it up here, and\n\n664\n00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.630\nnow I can use this to configure like,\nmy routing protocols, my static routes.\n\n665\n00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.420\nI can see what I'm directly\nconnected to here.\n\n666\n00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.580\nSo, the way that I configure this,\nI set config T.\n\n667\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.340\nInterface f0/0.\n\n668\n00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.650\nIP address.\n\n669\n00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.845\nI know I'm doing this again, but.\n\n670\n00:30:56.845 --> 00:31:00.690\n[COUGH] And\nI put in the whole mask there, didn't I?\n\n671\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.570\nWhich you guys can't see.\n\n672\n00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:03.670\nThere.\n\n673\n00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.230\nRight?\n\n674\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.520\nSo that's how I configured.\n\n675\n00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.530\nSo I went in and\nconfigured all of my interfaces this way.\n\n676\n00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:15.548\nNow one of the things is if I look\nat serial zero And look at 101010.\n\n677\n00:31:15.548 --> 00:31:19.431\nI see 10.1 and 10.5, I'm like,\nI wonder if those are /24s,\n\n678\n00:31:19.431 --> 00:31:22.290\nif that's a /24, it would never take that.\n\n679\n00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.270\nCuz they'd be in the same subnet.\n\n680\n00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.710\nSo I don't even know\nwhat the subnet mask is.\n\n681\n00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.380\nRight?\nSo that's kind of the problem with this.\n\n682\n00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.276\nAnd I'm telling you,\nI'm really liking the show protocols.\n\n683\n00:31:31.276 --> 00:31:35.640\n[COUGH] Proto Because now I can see,\nthey're /30s, right?\n\n684\n00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.930\nSo, this is a good command, too.\n\n685\n00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.520\nSo what have we done in this section here?\n\n686\n00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.536\nIn the course, I'm gonna go out to\nmy San Francisco router and L.A.\n\n687\n00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:47.207\nrouter and configure the same thing.\n\n688\n00:31:47.207 --> 00:31:53.297\nMy Host Names banners,\ninterface descriptions, passwords.\n\n689\n00:31:53.297 --> 00:31:57.491\nAnd then we're going to verify all that.\n\n690\n00:31:57.491 --> 00:31:59.549\nWhat are the verification\ncommands we went through?\n\n691\n00:31:59.549 --> 00:32:02.730\nI'm testing you guys\nthrough him vicariously.\n\n692\n00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.180\nWhat are the verification\ncommands we used?\n\n693\n00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.995\n>> We did the show IP interface brief.\n\n694\n00:32:06.995 --> 00:32:07.630\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n695\n00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:11.355\n>> We also did the show IP\n>> Interface.\n\n696\n00:32:11.355 --> 00:32:12.485\n>> Show IP interface.\n\n697\n00:32:12.485 --> 00:32:18.875\n>> IP interface, and\nalso the show protocols.\n\n698\n00:32:20.735 --> 00:32:24.115\n>> Show protocols is the command.\n\n699\n00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:29.890\nQuestion for you guys, how can I see on\nan interface if fast switching is enabled?\n\n700\n00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:35.210\nit's the show ip interface command,\nshow IP interface.\n\n701\n00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.270\nAll right guys, that's good.\n\n702\n00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.450\nLet's do one more thing\nbefore we finalize this, and\n\n703\n00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.670\nI'm gonna go back to my slides here for\na second.\n\n704\n00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.490\nBut I wanna just do a show run so\nwe can see our naval secret.\n\n705\n00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.850\nOur naval password is now encrypted\nbecause we used the service password\n\n706\n00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:52.740\nencryption command, right I guess I\nwas creating a pool testing that.\n\n707\n00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.390\nAgain, so notice under here\nthe duplex auto, the speed auto.\n\n708\n00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.870\nI did not set these,\nthere are some different\n\n709\n00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.800\ndefaults that show up under here for\nthe different iOS codes.\n\n710\n00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.750\nIf I was in 124,\nthis would never show up, right?\n\n711\n00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.140\nSo notice that my description, IP, right?\n\n712\n00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.460\nWAN, the clock rate that I set here Right?\n\n713\n00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.460\nAll right, and then there's my banner.\n\n714\n00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.530\nI don't know what happened to my banner,\nI guess I overwrote it right?\n\n715\n00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.340\nAnyways my consule.\n\n716\n00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.210\nHere's my password.\n\n717\n00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.730\nAnd we're going to get to this\ntransport and put all this.\n\n718\n00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:24.640\nThis is bad.\n\n719\n00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.190\nYou never want to see this.\n\n720\n00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.110\nI'm not even sure why this is in here,\nbut we're going to fix that.\n\n721\n00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.590\nOkay, let's run back one quick thing.\n\n722\n00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.040\nWe're almost done here.\n\n723\n00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.120\nIs this way.\n\n724\n00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.120\nWe show IP interface was goo,\nshow protocols as great.\n\n725\n00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.390\nI mean it shows me ip and\nipv six would be in here again.\n\n726\n00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.050\nAgain show ip interface brief,\nthis is a really good one as well.\n\n727\n00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.220\nSo what are your commands?\n\n728\n00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.750\nShow ip interface brief, show protocols,\nand notice my prompt here.\n\n729\n00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.980\nI'm showing you this on purpose,\nI can do this in user mode,\n\n730\n00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.700\nI don't have to be in privilege mode\nto type any of these show commands.\n\n731\n00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.820\nSo I don't even look at my running\nconfig to get my understanding.\n\n732\n00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.460\nIt takes a little bit more effort but\nI can get it done.\n\n733\n00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.250\nAnd then show IP interface, right?\n\n734\n00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.110\nAnd I can get everything,\nI can tell if an access list is set.\n\n735\n00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.300\nThis is kinda where they\ngets you on the exam.\n\n736\n00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.410\nShow access list, split horizon which\nwe'll talk about when we get to\n\n737\n00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:17.850\nrouting protocols and then fast switching\non this one here, it's disabled.\n\n738\n00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.210\nRight, but nonetheless this is where\nI can see all this information.\n\n739\n00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.250\nTo set a router back to factory defaults,\npretty simple to do.\n\n740\n00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.780\nIt's erase start reload, all right.\n\n741\n00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.870\nSo from global config,\nnotice I typed exit erase start, right.\n\n742\n00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.320\nSo here, watch this.\n\n743\n00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.150\nI can go here to my router,\nwhich is, where'd it go, here.\n\n744\n00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.990\nCome here baby.\n\n745\n00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.640\nAnd notice on here, erase,\nwatch this, start, and\n\n746\n00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.720\nit should give me an error and it did.\n\n747\n00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.290\nIt says, no, if you're going to do that\nI want to make sure you know the full\n\n748\n00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.820\ncommand, which is ridiculous\nbecause I can just use my tab key.\n\n749\n00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.830\nIt restarted batch config.\n\n750\n00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.810\nWatch.\n\n751\n00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.530\nGone, right,\nwell not gone until I confirm it.\n\n752\n00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.330\nBut now it's erasing my startup config and\nnvram.\n\n753\n00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:09.960\nIf I typed reload now,\nit would come back into setup mode, right?\n\n754\n00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.030\nSo one last thing guys,\nhere's my lab layout.\n\n755\n00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:19.040\nThought I had the here it is I am\nnot showing to them my screen here.\n\n756\n00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.300\nSo here we go here, so\nlets take a quick look last slide here.\n\n757\n00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.040\nIf you guys are follow along,\nwe are on the lynda.com the IOS section.\n\n758\n00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.040\nAlso, we just finished chapter six.\n\n759\n00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.950\nOkay, so follow along worth to chapter\nsix, bro that was half way through.\n\n760\n00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.780\n>> Excellent.\n>> She is awesome.\n\n761\n00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.560\nBack to you, Ronnie.\n\n762\n00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.130\n>> All right, well, taking a look at\nthis lab section, remember that if\n\n763\n00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.290\nanything that we've actually shown you,\nright, is a bit challenging.\n\n764\n00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:46.500\nYou need to go back in and\n\n765\n00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.110\nmake sure you feel very comfortable\nin running those commands.\n\n766\n00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.380\nWe're gonna ask some questions that\nare actually fairly easy on the exam, but\n\n767\n00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.880\nyou have to actually know what\nthey're gonna show you as well.\n\n768\n00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.310\nSo being comfortable with it.\n\n769\n00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.190\nBeing able to actually do this\nquickly because those simulators\n\n770\n00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.250\nare not gonna give you a lot of time\nto also work with them as well.\n\n771\n00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.730\nSo try these labs out.\n\n772\n00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.810\nMake sure you actually can work with them.\n\n773\n00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.530\nMake sure you feel comfortable\nworking with it as well.\n\n774\n00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.610\nSo thank you Todd, again, for\nleading us through that lab.\n\n775\n00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:11.760\n>> Yes, that was fun.\n\n776\n00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.490\n>> Thank you also for joining us today\n>> Signing off for ITProTV,\n\n777\n00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:17.310\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n778\n00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.050\n>> Yep, stick around,\nwe've got IOS management coming up.\n\n779\n00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.085\n>> Stay tuned for more CCENT content.\n\n780\n00:36:22.085 --> 00:36:31.290\n[SOUND]\n\n",
