in.\n\n3\n00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:14.283\nWe wanna make sure that you understood\nsome of the different details behind\n\n4\n00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:18.370\nalso getting ready for the exam and also\nwhat we'll be covering in this series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.800\nSo let's take a look at my desktop\nhere that will help us to see.\n\n6\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.420\nWhen we start off and we start taking a\nlook at the idea of doing the Cisco CCENT\n\n7\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.620\nshow, we wanna make sure that you\nare getting prepared for the right exam.\n\n8\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.520\nWhen you take a look at that, the exam\nnumber that you'll need, is that this show\n\n9\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.490\nis in preparation for exam 100-105\nICND1 is the actual exam name.\n\n10\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.200\nAnd our show is gonna be named,\nof course, Cisco CCENT,\n\n11\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.810\nin the idea of making sure that\nthey're all aligned together.\n\n12\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.200\nNow this exam though,\n\n13\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.790\nis gonna be about 90 minutes long, covers\nanywhere between 45 to 55 questions.\n\n14\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.455\nHave you worked that out?\n\n15\n00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.490\nIt's a little bit over an minute\nper question but not much.\n\n16\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.280\nSo, you want to make sure you\ntake requirement a bit seriously\n\n17\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.690\nbecause Cisco exams are notorious.\n\n18\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.280\nWhere the idea of not only of course do\nyou need to get the answers right but\n\n19\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.920\nof course you need to get them\nright very quickly as well.\n\n20\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880\nSo make sure you understand that\nbefore you go into the exam too.\n\n21\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.090\nNow as we start to get ready for that\nexam day and you're ready to go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.000\ntake this, you're gonna sign\nup at a Pearson VUE Center.\n\n23\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.810\nAnd you wanna make sure that you go\nthrough and you'll create your own\n\n24\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.560\nCisco ID, make sure that you get\nregistered for the proper exam.\n\n25\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.925\nAnd this is where you'll need that\nexam number that you'll be able to do,\n\n26\n00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:36.640\nthen you follow the instructions.\n\n27\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.370\nFind your nearest Pearson VUE\ntesting center to help you out.\n\n28\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.230\nNow as far as the exam costs go, I'm gonna\nclick on a different page to help us out.\n\n29\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.380\nAs of March 2017, so a little bit over a\nyear ago as of the recording of this show,\n\n30\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.740\nwe'll end up seeing that the exam\ncosts have actually changed over time.\n\n31\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.290\nAnd when we start looking at it, it's a\nproctored exam beginning with 100 and also\n\n32\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.244\nof course the 200 series here and when you\nsee that in US dollars, it's about $165.\n\n33\n00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:13.838\nNow if you happen to be in other places\naround the world, make sure you check and\n\n34\n00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:18.224\nthe easiest way to check the cost of this\nis gonna be through your Pearson VUE\n\n35\n00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:23.390\nwebsite to make sure that you get all\nthe actual right details ready to go too.\n\n36\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.980\nAlso, make sure you show up for\nthe testing, about 15 minutes early.\n\n37\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150\nBring the form of ID that you need to,\nas they ask you to do so and\n\n38\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.180\nthen get ready to test for\nthe exam as well.\n\n39\n00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.670\nSo what are some of the topics we'll\nbe covering inside of our series?\n\n40\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.700\nIt's gonna be based officially off of\ncourse, the objectives themselves.\n\n41\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.350\nAnd if you're saying, well, where are the\nexam objectives, if you just simply use\n\n42\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.450\nyour favorite search engine and\nyou type in Cisco exam 100-105,\n\n43\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.700\nit will probably lead\nyou to this web page.\n\n44\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.700\nAnd on this web page,\nyou'll end up seeing that there is a link\n\n45\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.660\ndown here where it says\nreview the exam topics.\n\n46\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.800\nWhen you click on that link, then it will\ngive you a list of topics which you can\n\n47\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.510\nnow download for a complete list\nof the topics in a PDF format.\n\n48\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.240\nWhen you do that, here's what\nthe download will bring you to.\n\n49\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.970\nIt will, of course,\nbring you to a breakdown of the exam\n\n50\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.850\nby the percentages here and\ntell you some of the same information.\n\n51\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.014\nNow you'll actually see\nthat is an assessment,\n\n52\n00:03:25.014 --> 00:03:28.037\nthat's gonna be 45 to 55 questions,\nabout 90 minutes here.\n\n53\n00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:32.130\nAnd you wanna make sure that you pay\nattention to each one of these topics.\n\n54\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.230\nSo during our show, we'll make sure that\nwe cover all of the actual networking\n\n55\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.540\nfundamentals which will account for\nabout a fifth of the exam itself.\n\n56\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.860\nWhich of course begins with the OSI and\nTCP model comparisons.\n\n57\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.654\nWe of course will break down and make sure\nthat we cover networking fundamentals,\n\n58\n00:03:49.654 --> 00:03:53.620\nas much as we can, to get you prepared for\nthe exam that comes along.\n\n59\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.054\nAlso, we'll be heading\nLAN Switching Fundamentals,\n\n60\n00:03:57.054 --> 00:04:02.096\nwhich of course includes understanding\nthe idea of various switching concepts,\n\n61\n00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.300\nthe Ethernet frame format as well.\n\n62\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.851\nOf course even some cabling\nissues that you'll run across,\n\n63\n00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:12.900\nbasic VLAN configuration, as well as\nconnecting the multiple switches too.\n\n64\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.920\nAnd you'll see that there's a lot of\ndifferent information in here that will be\n\n65\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.430\ncovering as we go on through the show.\n\n66\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.930\nOnce we get through that, of course\nthere will be routing fundamentals.\n\n67\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.450\nWe'll be using RIP primarily to help us\nunderstand the concept of routing but\n\n68\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.200\nalso, as our initial dynamic routing\nprotocol configurations too,\n\n69\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.210\nas well as we'll be handling\nstatic routing information.\n\n70\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.310\nWe'll also be doing some inter-VLAN\nrouting during that show and\n\n71\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.360\neven IPv6 routing,\nwe'll talk about that briefly too.\n\n72\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.381\nSo you'll see a lot of other\nthings are also included in there.\n\n73\n00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:48.915\nOnce we're done with the concept of\nrouting and switching, as far as the basic\n\n74\n00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:53.588\ntopic, we'll talk about of course\ninfrastructure services that also exists,\n\n75\n00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:56.767\nDNS and DHCP are kind of\nthe two basic ones you'll see.\n\n76\n00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:59.292\nAnd we've course what she set that up for\nus,\n\n77\n00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:03.320\nas well as the labs as we walk through\nall these different concepts too.\n\n78\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.010\nWe'll configure NTP, our network\ntime protocol, as well as NAT for\n\n79\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.680\nnetwork address translation, that will\nbe a big part of what we'll be covering.\n\n80\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.377\nAnd then lastly, we'll talk about\nsome infrastructure maintenance.\n\n81\n00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:17.810\nThroughout in the entire series, we'll\nprobably be using some of the different\n\n82\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.750\ntechnologies that we'll be covering\nhere in this bit domain objective.\n\n83\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.130\nTo make sure and\nthen we'll review them at the end,\n\n84\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.930\nwhere there's actually a lot of different\nprotocols and some of the different device\n\n85\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.080\nconfigurations that you\nneed to know about.\n\n86\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.267\nIn terms of securing the device and making\nsure that you know how to maintain them,\n\n87\n00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.189\nas well as do things like backups and\npassword recovery.\n\n88\n00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:42.000\nSo all these are actually\na part of the CCENT exam.\n\n89\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.535\nNow remember for this exam, it doesn't\nrequire you to have any other professional\n\n90\n00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.084\ncertification knowledge\nas you go into this.\n\n91\n00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:51.684\nSo there's no prerequisite or\nrequirement but\n\n92\n00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:56.560\nit does require you to have a strong\nformation in basic networking right away.\n\n93\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.480\nSo if you do not have that, it is\nrecommended of course that you go ahead\n\n94\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.180\nand that you take a look at getting some\nof that knowledge set before you start.\n\n95\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.181\nBut we'll be covering a lot of it\nas a review at the very beginning,\n\n96\n00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:12.116\nas it does cover a big\nportion of the exam as well.\n\n97\n00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:15.764\nOr another basic topic, right, that we\ndefinitely need to discuss in which\n\n98\n00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:17.954\nwe will discuss in depth\nwill be subnetting.\n\n99\n00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:21.020\nSo we'll make sure that you\nunderstand how to subnet,\n\n100\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.110\nas well as how to actually get\nfaster at doing subnetting as well.\n\n101\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.460\nWhich is probably one of the main and\n\n102\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.760\nprobably one of the hardest concepts\nthat you'll have to be able to do\n\n103\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.480\nat a proficient level on\nthe CCENT exam too, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.890\nSo, if you are getting prepared for\nyour Cisco CCENT exam,\n\n105\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.630\nmake sure you watch this episode and that\nyou review the concepts that are here.\n\n106\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.420\nAnd if you are ready to get started,\n\n107\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.990\nall you have to do is click\non the next video

00:00:15.930\nWelcome Back to another great\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.600\nI'm your show host, Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.760\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in the CCENT.\n\n9\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.150\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nour networking guru, Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.720\nRonnie, how we doing today, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.310\n&gt;&gt; We're doing fine, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.560\nThank you for having me back on\nthe show as we take a look now at\n\n13\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.610\nthe idea of what networking really is\nabout and why we also want to learn it.\n\n14\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.210\nSo, as we are beginning\nin the series here and\n\n15\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.930\nwe wanna make sure that we\nunderstand a few things.\n\n16\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.790\nMost of the times when somebody gets\nled into saying that certification\n\n17\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.550\ntrack of some sort and saying,\nhey, I want to earn the CCent, or\n\n18\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.180\nthe CCNT usually the question\nof course brings it up like why?\n\n19\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.790\nWhy do I really care,\nwhat is this really about?\n\n20\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.670\nSo, this particular episode really\nfocuses in on the where we begin, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.570\nThe reason why we do\nthe things that we do.\n\n22\n00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.710\nSo, what we're gonna do, or what Wes and I\nare gonna do is just talk about the basic\n\n23\n00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.490\ncommunication process to at least\nget us set on the right track.\n\n24\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.320\nAnd then, as you start to get into\n\n25\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.460\nthe actual studies that not\nonly cover the exam objective.\n\n26\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.180\nBut also, you are learning\nabout networking as well, and\n\n27\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.130\nlearning it better, you can actually\nsee where all the stuff falls in place.\n\n28\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.650\nSo, we wanna, of course,\nstart off with this idea, so\n\n29\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.910\nthat you have a great understanding\nof what the communication process is.\n\n30\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.590\nAnd then, we were transferred\nover into the computer world and\n\n31\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.780\nto networking world.\n\n32\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.600\nAnd then, of course,\nwe'll actually talk out why in the world\n\n33\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.510\nwe really want to begin to learn\nthis especially for the future, for\n\n34\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.780\nthose either heading to the IT career.\n\n35\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.646\nThis is a great place to begin here.\n\n36\n00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:54.430\nAll right, so, Wes, as we start to\ntake a look at these concepts and\n\n37\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.100\nthe idea of networking when I first began,\n\n38\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.920\nWes, I really didn't understand like\nwhy does it really matter, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.140\nWhat is the point,\nwhat is it that we really want to get to.\n\n40\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.090\nBut it really took a little\nbit of time before I realize\n\n41\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.680\nthat learning on a computer\nby itself it works.\n\n42\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.330\nBut with out me as she also being able\nto communicate with another computer and\n\n43\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.880\nbeing able to connect to another computer.\n\n44\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.270\nIt really is kinda very lonely venture,\nand\n\n45\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.730\nthe very fact that I'm not\ngetting much work done.\n\n46\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.650\nI'm getting a little bit of work done, but\n\n47\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.609\na standalone computer by itself it really\nonly accomplishes what you need it to do.\n\n48\n00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.850\nBut it may not help out anything else and\n\n49\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.630\nin the society that we live in\ncomputers aren't connected,\n\n50\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.690\nbecause it's together that they really\ndo form a little bit more powerful.\n\n51\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.970\nSo, that's why we're actually\nstarting her at this point,\n\n52\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.890\nwhich is what we want to do.\n\n53\n00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.960\n&gt;&gt; You know, Ronnie,\none of the things I was thinking of,\n\n54\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.110\nright there in the name is\nnetworking technician, right.\n\n55\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.144\nAnd networking is about communication, but\nwhen it comes to communication, what is\n\n56\n00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:55.851\nit, Ronnie, that it takes for essentially\na couple of nodes to communicate?\n\n57\n00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nlet's start with just you and me first.\n\n58\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.630\nOkay, and instead of going\ndirectly into the computer node\n\n59\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.970\nmost of the time we don't think\nabout the process of communication.\n\n60\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.940\nAnd that's, because you and\n\n61\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.110\nI have learned to do this from the time\nthat our parents started to talk to us.\n\n62\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.638\nWe made faces, we kinda made some gurgling\nsounds, our parents would communicate with\n\n63\n00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:19.770\nus, we'd respond back stuff\nlike that would end up happen.\n\n64\n00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.902\nBut as we continued to grow, and\nstarted to learn a little bit more,\n\n65\n00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:28.618\nwe started to realize something,\nthat there is a process to communication,\n\n66\n00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:31.870\nbecause it's not just\nenough that I say things.\n\n67\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370\nOkay, what has to happen in the entire\ncommunication process at least between two\n\n68\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.320\nindividuals, is not only is there a source\nin other words somebody saying something.\n\n69\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.280\nBut there is also going to be\nthe idea of a destination, or\n\n70\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.700\na receiver, in which somebody is also\nlistening to what's actually being said.\n\n71\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.590\nSo, in that sense communication\nprocess at least involves, well,\n\n72\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.460\nthose two concepts, right?, you have\na source and you have a destination.\n\n73\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.810\nAnd when you have both, then you can\nbegin that process of communication.\n\n74\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.990\nBeing able to get a message that you\nwant to actually have as a source, and\n\n75\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.860\nthen relay that to someone else that you\nwant to also know that same information.\n\n76\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.130\nSo, that's where the process begins.\n\n77\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.000\nNow, Wes, when you and I think about\nit it's not difficult in human terms,\n\n78\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.840\nbecause like I said,\nwe've been doing it our entire lives.\n\n79\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.710\nBut overall, Wes, if we were to break it\ndown, we're not gonna break it down to\n\n80\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.160\nthe smallest components, but if you and\nI were just to break down that process,\n\n81\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.790\nit actually is a little bit more\ncomplex than what we think, right?\n\n82\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.570\nSo, let's begin to try and\nunderstand the breakdown at the beginning.\n\n83\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.740\nSo, Wes, here we are.\n\n84\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.210\nWe're on the show, and we're talking about\nthe basic idea of communication, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.710\nAnd I want to relay the stuff that we're\ngonna be talking about, of course, to our\n\n86\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.020\naudience, as well as to you and to whoever\nelse is actually watching this, too.\n\n87\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.480\nSo, what needs to happen is\nI need to formulate that.\n\n88\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.340\nSo, I think in terms of words and once I\nhave the words, now, Wes, that's in my\n\n89\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.810\nmind, and Wes, you don't know what words\ngonna come out of my mouth next, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.360\nBecause if you did,\nyou'd be telepathic, okay.\n\n91\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.070\nSo, Wes, are you telepathic by any chance.\n\n92\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.720\n&gt;&gt; No, not yet, because if I\ndo I'd have the lotto numbers.\n\n93\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you're not telepathic,\nokay, that means somehow for\n\n94\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.910\nme to actually be able to tell Wes\nwhat message I want to give him,\n\n95\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.460\nthis is where it has to begin.\n\n96\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.080\nI need to take whatever's in my mind, and\nthen be able to actually form it into\n\n97\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.860\nwords that I say, or I write, or somehow\nusing some type of electronic process,\n\n98\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.420\nwhatever that may be to communicate that.\n\n99\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.860\nSo, at that point there is\na conversion of sorts, right?\n\n100\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.150\nI'm taking the thoughts and\nideas that are words in my mind, and\n\n101\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.580\nI'm putting them down on something.\n\n102\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.330\nThe easiest kind of analogy is the idea\nof writing an old school letter,\n\n103\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.050\ntoday called snail mail, right?\n\n104\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.890\nEasy enough, we take our thoughts and\nwe put down words onto pen and\n\n105\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.440\npaper, and there we go.\n\n106\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.510\nNow, Wes,\nif I put that down into an envelope,\n\n107\n00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.310\nand I put your name on\nthe front of that envelope, and\n\n108\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.280\nI set it aside, Wes, do you still\nknow what words are inside of that.\n\n109\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.110\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so.\n\n110\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.220\nI think, we've got pretty much a\ncommunication that is still with you, and\n\n111\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.590\nthere is no way that I can\nunderstand whats going on.\n\n112\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.608\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\neven as something as a letter, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:20.450\nOr just in the communication process here.\n\n114\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.980\nEven if it's voice, if you don't\nknow I'm speaking to you, Wes,\n\n115\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.730\nyou may just kind of ignore me, because I\nhaven't actually figured out who you know,\n\n116\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.560\nor you haven't actually understood that\nI'm trying to communicate with you.\n\n117\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.930\nWell, that me sending that\nletter over the Wes, well,\n\n118\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.060\nit means that Wes doesn't have the\ncontents of the message that I want, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.200\nOr that I want Wes to have as well.\n\n120\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.490\nSo, during that point,\n\n121\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.360\nright just in that process, there's\na lot of complexity that's within that.\n\n122\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.570\nWords getting put down on paper,\nand now we need that,\n\n123\n00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.150\nbecause that's now the physical\ncomponent of what we have, or\n\n124\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.860\nas a vocal component if I'm just trying\nto have a conversation with Wes.\n\n125\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.170\nAnd I don't wanna address Wes,\nI just walk in the room and start talking.\n\n126\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.150\nWes may totally ignore me,\njust like he normally does, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.695\nBut overall, though, if I address Wes and\nsay, hey, Wes, let's have a conversation,\n\n128\n00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:12.500\nlet's talk about this, then Wes\nunderstands, Ronnie wants me to listen.\n\n129\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.990\nIf he gets the letter and\nit says Wes Bryan on that envelope,\n\n130\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.030\nWes knows that what, the letter app\nis actually meant for Wes, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.810\nSo, at that point in that process\nin that communication, well,\n\n132\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.830\nonce it gets over to Wes, now Wes, we're\ngonna leave it sealed up in the envelope.\n\n133\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.280\nOnce again, Wes,\ncan you use your X-Ray vision, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.000\nAnd your mental abilities.\n\n135\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.800\nAnd with that letter all folded up\nto actually determine what message I\n\n136\n00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.680\nhad in there?\n\n137\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.350\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so, and\nI'm gonna kinda date myself and\n\n138\n00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.750\nage myself here on this one.\n\n139\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.290\nI'm going back to the days\nof Johnny Carson.\n\n140\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.390\nPut that letter up to his head [CROSSTALK]\ncarnet that's right, trying to figure out.\n\n141\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.940\nNo.\n\n142\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.620\nI don't know.\n\n143\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.710\nEven if you vocalize it, or write it down,\nif it's still concealed like that,\n\n144\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.410\nI'm not exactly sure what's going on.\n\n145\n00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.620\n&gt;&gt; So, there has to be some method.\n\n146\n00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.709\nAnd you know, because you've receive\nletters that got your name on and up.\n\n147\n00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:02.873\nBut the only way that you could get into\nit is that you understand how to unpack\n\n148\n00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:04.962\nthat letter, and\nknow how to open up the envelop.\n\n149\n00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:07.720\nHow to read, and that's what\nwe're assuming at this point Wes.\n\n150\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.342\nI'm gonna say that you know how to read.\n\n151\n00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:12.159\nAnd then of course you\nprocess the information, and\n\n152\n00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:16.191\nin the end what should be able to happen\nis that Wes comes back to me and goes,\n\n153\n00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.320\nhey Ronnie, thank you for the letter.\n\n154\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.830\nOr I understand what you were trying\nto tell me in the letter now, and\n\n155\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.320\nthat confirms to me that\nyou got the message.\n\n156\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n157\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.990\nSo in this particular process of things,\njust on the human level, on\n\n159\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.200\nthe communication side of things, that is\na bit more complex than we thought about.\n\n160\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.980\nSo even when we are just talking about\nit in voice same way that we're having\n\n161\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.180\na conversation, or\nwhether we're sending it as a letter.\n\n162\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.870\nOr today is probably not a letter\nanymore it's an email of sorts.\n\n163\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.150\nBut as we start to do this, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.790\nThe whole end result of what\nwe're talking about okay,\n\n165\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.330\nis me having the message\nthat needs to be sent.\n\n166\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.900\nThe source, I'm the source and\nactually being how to get it\n\n167\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.560\nto the destination that I want\nit to get it to over to Wes.\n\n168\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.620\nAnd not only has Wes has the letter in\nhand, but that Wes can open that letter.\n\n169\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.450\nWes can actually take a look\nat what's inside of it, and\n\n170\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.270\nunderstanding in the end,\nWes processes the information so\n\n171\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.190\nthat he fully gets the message\nthat was intended to be delivered.\n\n172\n00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.750\n&gt;&gt; So we understand what it takes for\neven the basic human communications.\n\n173\n00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.230\nThe information by itself\nisn't gonna really help you.\n\n174\n00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.230\nYou need a way to vocalize it.\n\n175\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.900\nWhether it's, well, or write it down.\n\n176\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.010\nSo if that's what it takes for\njust our humans to communicate,\n\n177\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.920\nwhat does it take for\nthe computer to communicate?\n\n178\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.620\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we have to get to.\n\n179\n00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.780\nThe very notion and\nfact is that when we start to\n\n180\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.830\nnow realize that working on\nthe computer alone only gets us so far.\n\n181\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.340\nWhich is the same concept\nas what I talked about.\n\n182\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.810\nI have thoughts and\nI start to write them down.\n\n183\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.870\nI start to do a couple of things.\n\n184\n00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.380\nIt now begins to get a little\nbit more hefty in terms of\n\n185\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.220\nwhat we actually need to happen.\n\n186\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.840\nFor just something that\nsimple to communicate.\n\n187\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.720\nSo here it is, Wes.\n\n188\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.920\nYou and I are sitting in front\nof two different computers.\n\n189\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.680\nAnd if I wanted to be able to have a\ncommunication sent between my computer and\n\n190\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.150\nyour computer,\nit means that we have to do it somehow.\n\n191\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.820\nAnd this is the hard part in\nthe process of what goes on.\n\n192\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.830\nSo Wes, even if I start typing out.\n\n193\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.690\nLet's take a look at my screen just for\na moment.\n\n194\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.615\nThis will kind of help us.\n\n195\n00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:24.020\nWe've just talked about this idea that\ncommunication process without computers\n\n196\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.890\nand networking.\n\n197\n00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.380\nAnd now we're moving into this\nprocess with computers and networking.\n\n198\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.250\nSo right here, Wes,\nas we start to take a look here.\n\n199\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.860\nI've got a computer, and we'll just\ncall this one our Source Computer.\n\n200\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.800\nOkay, so this is going to be Ronnie.\n\n201\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.250\nAnd then Wes,\nyou have the Destination Computer.\n\n202\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.670\nAnd this is going to be Wes' computer.\n\n203\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.300\nAll right, so Wes you and\nI have two computers okay.\n\n204\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.160\nSo we're done, right?\n\n205\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.900\nThat's all we need.\n\n206\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got a little bit more to go.\n\n207\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.220\nCuz just like in your analogy\nwith two people communicating,\n\n208\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.890\none of the things I think about is\njust like you have the information.\n\n209\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.750\nAnd essentially it's still in your head,\nright?\n\n210\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.890\nIt hasn't gone anywhere.\n\n211\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.050\nSo I'm thinking that we\nneed a little bit more,\n\n212\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.590\na few more components that\nI might be missing here\n\n213\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.780\nwhen you talk about actually getting\nthat communication over to my computer.\n\n214\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo let's\n\n215\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.230\nthink about some of the things\nthat we might need here.\n\n216\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.150\nSo if I type something out,\njust like on this,\n\n217\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.360\na basic Word processor,\nwell I can type it out, I can save it,\n\n218\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.540\nit saves as a file but\nit still doesn't get over to you Wes.\n\n219\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.830\nSo at that point, we need to\nhave a couple of things in hand.\n\n220\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.190\nOne, of course, is just the pathway,\nthe physical pathway.\n\n221\n00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.610\nWhat we call media so\n\n222\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.465\nthat this file on my computer can\nget transferred to Wes' computer.\n\n223\n00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:37.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n224\n00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.510\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, I'm gonna ask for\nyour help here.\n\n225\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.460\nWhat are some of the possible pathways?\n\n226\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, when I break it down, I think of\nit's gonna come down to two categories.\n\n227\n00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.100\nIt's gonna be some kind of bounded\ncommunication type, media type,\n\n228\n00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.610\nif you will.\n\n229\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:55.160\nOr its gonna be some kind of\nunbounded media communication type.\n\n230\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.450\nSo if we think about it that way,\nif I think of bounded communication,\n\n231\n00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.350\nthe first thing I think is one of the most\nprevalent is some kind of cabling.\n\n232\n00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.060\nAnd I know there's different types of\ncabling, but there's some kind of cabling.\n\n233\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.310\nAnd when it comes to any kind\nof unbounded communication,\n\n234\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.690\nI'm thinking wireless communication.\n\n235\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.350\nAnd I know I'm using it more generic cuz\nI know there's whole different types\n\n236\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.560\nwireless or unbounded type communications.\n\n237\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.423\nAnd those are the two,\nthe most prevalent that I think of.\n\n238\n00:12:19.423 --> 00:12:23.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when we start thinking about\nthe idea of wireless here, usually for\n\n239\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.540\nmost of us if we were doing this,\nit'd be some type of radio frequency.\n\n240\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.000\nOr in the media that we have\nin terms of the pathways,\n\n241\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000\nthat's what we're also talking about here,\nis some type of media.\n\n242\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.240\nSo this established the pathway for\ndata to get from the sending computer or\n\n243\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.930\nthe source computer to\nthe destination computer as well.\n\n244\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:46.000\nNow Wes I know something cuz I'm\nlooking at our computers right here.\n\n245\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.540\nWes is on a Macbook Pro.\n\n246\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.700\nCool, right?\n\n247\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.550\nRonnie is on a Linux machine.\n\n248\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.125\n&gt;&gt; Still cool.\n\n249\n00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:54.019\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Still cool.\n\n250\n00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Still cool what Ronnie's running,\nbut here it is.\n\n251\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.880\nNow, in this sense, Wes,\n\n252\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.870\nI have to make sure that, well, does your\nmachine understand what's on my machine?\n\n253\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.250\nAnd actually right now I'm\non a Windows computer.\n\n254\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.710\nSo that actually even makes it better.\n\n255\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.610\nI was trying to, I looked down,\nno, I'm on the Windows machine.\n\n256\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.150\nI'm not on the Linux computer.\n\n257\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.190\nSo right here I'm actually\ninside of a Windows machine.\n\n258\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.310\nSo Wes, I can send this over to you.\n\n259\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.280\nBut because I'm on a Windows machine and\nyou're on a Mac it could\n\n260\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.130\nbe that your machine and\nmy machine don't really get it.\n\n261\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.040\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm thinking, I'm thinking\nthat letters back to your first analogy\n\n262\n00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.140\nthere, if you id put that there in\na letter and I opened it up and\n\n263\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.400\nlet's say for\nwhatever reason it's written in German or\n\n264\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.910\nSpanish I wouldn't be able to\nunderstand the communication.\n\n265\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.980\nSo it seems like we would have some\nkind of interoperability problem there.\n\n266\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.520\nLike a communication and\nnot really a breakdown but then,\n\n267\n00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.700\nI don't even know if\nthe communication will happen.\n\n268\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.272\n&gt;&gt; Right, so there's something\nelse that has to go on here.\n\n269\n00:13:49.272 --> 00:13:54.500\nSo we actually need to of course then\nalso establish essentially agreements.\n\n270\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.180\nHow are we gonna do this?\n\n271\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.840\nAnd what we generally call this\nas some type of protocols,\n\n272\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.560\nor common protocols that we actually have.\n\n273\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.190\nSo we're actually saying, hey here's how\nwe are going to agree to communicate.\n\n274\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.650\nThen we'll establish some type of common\nprotocol that will allow me to transfer my\n\n275\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.390\nfile over to Wes's machine\nusing the same thing\n\n276\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.970\nboth sides understand using\nthe same common protocol for\n\n277\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.210\nus to be able to do something like this.\n\n278\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.800\nSo, along with that, right,\nthere's a lot of stuff in between this.\n\n279\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.060\nBut we're just trying to\nget the basics down so\n\n280\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.470\nthat we understand what ends up happening.\n\n281\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.710\nNow, Wes actually did mention\nthis idea of breaking down,\n\n282\n00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.785\nbecause if we don't do this,\nI can send it out in one protocol and\n\n283\n00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:42.670\nWes' computer is not listed\non that protocol, he's right.\n\n284\n00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.660\nThe machine will go, I see the traffic.\n\n285\n00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.980\nI just don't understand it.\n\n286\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.080\nIt's probably not meant for me.\n\n287\n00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.310\nSo why in the world would\nwe actually do that?\n\n288\n00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.380\nSo it could be that.\n\n289\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.170\nOr it could be that I'm communicating\non wireless, and Wes says, yeah, no,\n\n290\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.060\nmy wireless adapter on my machine,\nI turned it off.\n\n291\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.450\nWell, I'm communicating on one media,\nhe's communicating on a different media,\n\n292\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.260\nwell now we're having issues as well.\n\n293\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.660\nSo all that's actually very possible.\n\n294\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.169\nWhat if there's a possibility that on\nmy machine I'm using one particular\n\n295\n00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:17.608\napplication and Wes, on his machine\ndoesn't have that same application\n\n296\n00:15:17.608 --> 00:15:20.344\nto open that file type\nthat I'm sending him?\n\n297\n00:15:20.344 --> 00:15:24.230\nOnce again, that still breaks\ndown the communication path.\n\n298\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.155\nSo in the same way that human\ncommunication can break down,\n\n299\n00:15:27.155 --> 00:15:30.990\nWes mentioned in one language or\nanother one.\n\n300\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.380\nOr it was written in Spanish in that\nsense, or it was written on something that\n\n301\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.520\nI can't actually read somehow, somewhere\nthen we have issues in terms of breakdown.\n\n302\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.790\nSo all these are,\n\n303\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.800\nin terms of communication,\nissues that we tend to face.\n\n304\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.350\nSo there's a lot to get communication\nto work, and any one of those, Wes,\n\n305\n00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.230\ncan actually break that communication\ndown and cause it not to work.\n\n306\n00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.511\nAnd that's what we want\nto understand as well.\n\n307\n00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:58.584\nBoth of those, whether we're talking about\nhuman communication or whether we're\n\n308\n00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:02.270\ntalking about a computer to computer\ncommunication, the goal is the same.\n\n309\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.988\nThe end result is the same.\n\n310\n00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:06.362\nEnd-to-end communication.\n\n311\n00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:12.070\nThe source gets to the designation\nexactly what they want to get to.\n\n312\n00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.140\nBut anything along that path, of all the\nthings that we have setup correctly, any\n\n313\n00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.490\none thing can break along that and that's\nwhere things actually get miscommunicated.\n\n314\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:27.470\nWe always joke about this at some point,\nthe idea of punctuation that matters.\n\n315\n00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.300\nSo even if I were to send Wes a letter and\nI put the wrong punctuation.\n\n316\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.012\nIt might mean something 100% different\nthan what I intended it to mean and\n\n317\n00:16:36.012 --> 00:16:39.905\nWes misreads and\nhe kind of understands something else.\n\n318\n00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:43.355\nSo just realize that there's a lot\nof things in between that, okay?\n\n319\n00:16:43.355 --> 00:16:45.625\nSo, Wes,\nwhy in the world is this important?\n\n320\n00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.655\nAnd that's what we want to understand,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:51.005\nAnd that's actually really\na great question for\n\n322\n00:16:51.005 --> 00:16:53.095\nus to actually think about, okay?\n\n323\n00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.655\nRemember that when you start\nworking with computers, you do,\n\n324\n00:16:55.655 --> 00:17:00.495\nyou focus in on hardware a lot of times\nand understanding the operating system.\n\n325\n00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:05.460\nbut we don't really focus in on, how do we\nestablish the communication between us and\n\n326\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.480\nthe other computers, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.940\nAnd when we don't do something like that,\nit means that we'll not actually\n\n328\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.110\nunderstanding the process of some of the\nthings that can happen along the way and\n\n329\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.690\nthen we don't know where the failure is.\n\n330\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.670\nWes, if I don't know\nanything about networking,\n\n331\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.650\nwhere do I have to assume that the problem\nis, if it's not getting through?\n\n332\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess any one of those\nmultiple points that you have there,\n\n333\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.010\nif we have multiple avenues and\nthings that we need, attributes,\n\n334\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.220\nif you will, to be able to send the\ncommunication between these two computers,\n\n335\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.588\nit seems like we have multiple\npoints of failure too.\n\n336\n00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:39.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have multiple points\nof failures that can happen and\n\n337\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.720\nno doubt that it can happen\nanywhere along there.\n\n338\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.190\nBut if I don't know\nanything about networking,\n\n339\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.790\nI have to assume that it happened where?\n\n340\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.910\nOn my own computer, that I'm going to go,\nwhat did I do wrong?\n\n341\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.600\nWes, I might not have done anything wrong,\nright?\n\n342\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.440\nThe very notion is,\nI might be doing everything fine, and\n\n343\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.620\nsomewhere along the line,\nsomething broke down.\n\n344\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.230\nA connector along the path is broken.\n\n345\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.890\nA wire got somehow crimped the wrong way.\n\n346\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.010\nA particular router is kind of\ngoing nuts a little bit and\n\n347\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.640\nit's just not allowing it through.\n\n348\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.450\nOr it's actually having to take a long\nway around that it didn't need to.\n\n349\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.310\nWhatever it might be,\nit may actually be any of those problems.\n\n350\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.740\nBut if I don't know\nanything about networking,\n\n351\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.520\nWes, someone that's actually really\nsaying, I'm troubleshooting this computer.\n\n352\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.460\nI really have to begin and\nend pretty much with,\n\n353\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.360\nit's gotta be my fault\nsomewhere on my end.\n\n354\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.030\nA networking is actually what allows\nyou to figure out along that pathway,\n\n355\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.320\nnot only where things can go wrong but\nwhat has to be established so\n\n356\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.560\nthat everything goes right, okay?\n\n357\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.390\nSo that's the cool a thing\nabout understanding networking.\n\n358\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.220\nAnd Wes I've said it for years and years.\n\n359\n00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.770\nOkay, the very fact is that\nnetworking is pretty much the heart\n\n360\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.620\nof anything that you do in IT.\n\n361\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.510\nOkay, in any information\ntechnology field that's out there.\n\n362\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.570\nIf you don't understand the networking\nprocess, well, you're really kinda kicking\n\n363\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.510\nout a foundational part of what\nactually can go wrong, and\n\n364\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.740\nthen you don't actually have clue\nof what's happening at that point.\n\n365\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.380\nSo, we wanna spend some time, then,\nat least in this series, of helping you\n\n366\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.020\nto understand of course, not only\nthe fundamentals of networking but\n\n367\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.120\nwe're also gonna show you\nof course using Cisco.\n\n368\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.230\nBranded hardware is what we're gonna do,\n\n369\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.110\nis how they get all that\ninfrastructure thing then set up so\n\n370\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.000\nthat you can have that established end\nto end communication process, as well.\n\n371\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.350\nAnd that's what we also want\nto do in this series, too.\n\n372\n00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.570\nNow, Wes, when we talk about\nthe idea of networking, Wes,\n\n373\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.185\nI know that you actually do a ton of\nthe CompTIA courses and you go through\n\n374\n00:19:38.185 --> 00:19:41.370\nNetwork+ which is much larger than\nwhat we'll actually be doing here.\n\n375\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.670\nSo, there's a lot of things that\nare out there in the world.\n\n376\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.690\nBut the neat thing is that, at least for\n\n377\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.570\nme, right Is not only the understanding\nof the theory that's behind it.\n\n378\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.970\nBut in the realm of Cisco,\nand this is why I like it and\n\n379\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.000\nwhy I think is needed, and\nwhy I think you will want to learn it.\n\n380\n00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.867\nIs not one of the things that we tend to\ndo in some other basic networking which is\n\n381\n00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.209\njust make sure has the right IP\naddress and right default gateway and\n\n382\n00:20:04.209 --> 00:20:07.868\nsubnet mask and you will be fine and\nyou will be able to communicate and go.\n\n383\n00:20:07.868 --> 00:20:10.503\nThat's what I call set it and\nforget it sometimes, right?\n\n384\n00:20:10.503 --> 00:20:14.323\nYou learn the basic theories, you set\nthat up and you just kind to do that.\n\n385\n00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:19.395\nWith Cisco, though, you'll get to\ndo hands-on actually using and\n\n386\n00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:21.590\nsetting this stuff up.\n\n387\n00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.250\nSo it's not only the idea\nof configuring it and\n\n388\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.130\nthen just leaving it alone,\nit's you troubleshooting it.\n\n389\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.840\nIt's you actually typing it in,\n\n390\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.470\nit's you working with the equipment\nin that process to that point where\n\n391\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.120\nyou working with it makes you understand\nthe process better along the way.\n\n392\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.040\nYou're actually doing hands on in\njust about every step of the process.\n\n393\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.642\nSo, that's why I think that you\nwant to focus in on the CCENT or\n\n394\n00:20:45.642 --> 00:20:48.200\nthe CCENT is what you'll\nalso hear it called.\n\n395\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.220\nBecause it's neat stuff,\nat the same time by doing this, and\n\n396\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.200\nalso some of the shows like what Wes does,\nin terms of Network+,\n\n397\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.150\nit's only gonna help you as you get\nstarted into your networking career.\n\n398\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.320\nSo, Wes, when we start talking about this,\n\n399\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.150\nwhat we're really to do at\nthis point especially we\n\n400\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.275\nhaven't really gotten into the networking\nside, is that this class is for that.\n\n401\n00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:12.450\nIs to help us jump in to that.\n\n402\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.650\nLearn about the basics and the processes\nof it and then getting that established.\n\n403\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.420\nBut then begin to understand\nthe actual pieces of\n\n404\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.410\nequipment that we'll be working with.\n\n405\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.270\nAnd once we get that down, we'll have\na better fundamental understanding of\n\n406\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.880\nthe way that networking works.\n\n407\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.120\nAnd then you can move\ntowards advanced things,\n\n408\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.370\nsuch as manipulating how it actually\nis supposed to work, as well.\n\n409\n00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.135\nSo there's a lot of things coming up for\nus.\n\n410\n00:21:34.135 --> 00:21:35.935\nBut we wanted to start this way.\n\n411\n00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:38.925\n&gt;&gt; So it's important, not only to be\nable to identify those pieces even at\n\n412\n00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:42.135\nan elementary level, you need to\nknow that to set up those networks,\n\n413\n00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.475\nto set up those communications\nbetween those end points.\n\n414\n00:21:44.475 --> 00:21:46.365\nAnd then ultimately,\nto be able to troubleshoot it and\n\n415\n00:21:46.365 --> 00:21:49.545\nidentify where the issue might lie,\ncuz as Ronnie's shown you,\n\n416\n00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:53.365\nthere's a lot of moving pieces and this\nreally was just a high level overview.\n\n417\n00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:57.202\nAnd I can't wait to see as we move in\nthrough more episodes here in CCENT,\n\n418\n00:21:57.202 --> 00:22:00.400\nwe get from that 30,000 foot overview and\n\n419\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.800\nwe start to rifle down into those\ncomponents and be very vendor specific.\n\n420\n00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.300\nSo, Ronnie, it does look like\nwe are coming to the end of yet\n\n421\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.590\nanother great episode here.\n\n422\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.862\nBut before we do, do you have any\nadditional words on maybe some things\n\n423\n00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.638\nyou'd like to impart to the viewers or\n\n424\n00:22:12.638 --> 00:22:14.873\nwhat they can expect as\nwe dive more into CCENT?\n\n425\n00:22:14.873 --> 00:22:16.442\nI just really have one other thing,\n\n426\n00:22:16.442 --> 00:22:19.122\nas I look down at my notes I kind\nof realize I forgot one thing.\n\n427\n00:22:19.122 --> 00:22:21.361\nWes, that whole process\nthat we were talking about,\n\n428\n00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:24.607\nwe were talking about things that really\naffected us in the same room, okay?\n\n429\n00:22:24.607 --> 00:22:28.020\nOur two computers, you and\nI really being in the same room,\n\n430\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.445\nwe did use the analogy of a ladder,\nbeing able to go across.\n\n431\n00:22:31.445 --> 00:22:35.117\nBut this is something else I want\nto emphasize to you as well,\n\n432\n00:22:35.117 --> 00:22:38.501\nonce you can establish\nthe foundations of networking,\n\n433\n00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:42.870\nyou're no longer gonna be limited\nby the idea of distance anymore.\n\n434\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.880\nYou can then network all the way\naround the world if you need to.\n\n435\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.050\nEven that you understand\nthe basic fundamentals,\n\n436\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.600\nas long as you understand those\nfundamentals as we're moving through them.\n\n437\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.470\nAnd you'll see along the way,\nyou'll actually be able to program and\n\n438\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:59.060\nget that done inside of the Cisco\nequipment to help you out.\n\n439\n00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.280\nSo don't think it about a limitation\njust between two computers\n\n440\n00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.620\ncuz those computers can be\nsetup in the same room.\n\n441\n00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.110\nOr they can actually be setup all\nthe way around the rest of the world or\n\n442\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.660\nthe other half of the world, and\nyou can still do the same process and\n\n443\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.300\nit scales up to where you can actually go\nthat far, or even farther if you need to.\n\n444\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.920\nSo there's a lot of stuff for\nus that's actually ahead.\n\n445\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.120\nWe've still got some\nfundamentals to cover.\n\n446\n00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.940\nBut once we do that,\nwe'll jump right into Cisco equipment and\n\n447\n00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.820\nwe'll do a deep dive into it and\nwe'll get you ready for networking.\n\n448\n00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, as always, we\nappreciate having you here in the studios.\n\n449\n00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.460\nCan't wait to see more of\nthose episodes coming.\n\n450\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.840\nAnd we appreciate having you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n451\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.330\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n452\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n453\n00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.834\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n454\n00:23:39.834 --> 00:23:45.882\n[MUSIC]\n\n455\n00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:48.430\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.326\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:13.675\nYou're watching IT ProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello to all our viewers out there,\n\n5\n00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.465\nwelcome to another great episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:22.075\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in the Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:24.695\nAnd joining me back in the studios\nagain is Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:27.235\nRonnie, how we're doing today, sir?\n&gt;&gt; We are doing fine, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:30.485\nThank you once again for\nhaving me back on the show as we\n\n10\n00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.470\ncontinue our journey in\nlearning more about networking.\n\n11\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.972\nAnd our basic fundamentals of networking,\nright?\n\n12\n00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:41.324\nWe wanna begin exactly\nwhere we should begin, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:45.732\nAnd today, we are talking,\nof course, about understanding and\n\n14\n00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.426\napplying the OSi model.\n\n15\n00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:48.080\nOkay?\n\n16\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.630\nSo Wes, let's kind of rewind\nour history a little bit here.\n\n17\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.131\nAnd Wes,\n\n18\n00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:57.910\nwe're gonna kind of playback kind of that\nlittle snippet of This is Your Life, Wes.\n\n19\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.170\nSo Wes, when you first heard about the OSi\nmodel and you first started to see it,\n\n20\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.230\nwhat did you think was going on here?\n&gt;&gt; Boy boy,\n\n21\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.451\nwhy didn't I just take the blue pill?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.049\n&gt;&gt; That's for sure, a lot of terminology,\n\n23\n00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.960\nand I remember when I first see the OSI\nmodel saying what have I got myself into.\n\n24\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.860\nAt first, you think a lot of theory but\napparently this OSI model,\n\n25\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.640\nit has a lot of benefits in\nyour learning networks as well\n\n26\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.930\nas your continued network administration.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Wes,\n\n27\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.680\nonce we start talking about this idea and\nyou're gonna hear about it over and\n\n28\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.640\nover again, throughout the entire series,\nwe're gonna be referring to the model that\n\n29\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780\nwe'll be discussing right here and\npossibly even in another episode.\n\n30\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.264\nIt really depends on how much I talk,\nWes, and\n\n31\n00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:46.892\nhow much you talk on this\nparticular topic here.\n\n32\n00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:50.374\nBut we want to, of course, make sure\nthat you understand what it is but\n\n33\n00:01:50.374 --> 00:01:54.386\nwe also want to guide you through a little\nbit about the history of it because it's\n\n34\n00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:57.178\nactually very interesting\na little bit of the history.\n\n35\n00:01:57.178 --> 00:02:00.543\nAnd then of course why do we\nwant to really learn it and\n\n36\n00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:03.860\nthen how does it help us in networking,\nokay?\n\n37\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.050\nSo I wanna make sure that we cover\nall of that and get down to it so\n\n38\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.840\nthat we understand the way that\nthings actually ended up developing.\n\n39\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.700\nNow Wes, networking that,\nas it exists today in the 21st century,\n\n40\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780\nis not how it always worked in the past.\n\n41\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.045\nSo if we go back historically, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:27.590\nEven before Wes's day which is now so\nlong ago that Wes doesn't remember.\n\n43\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.820\nSo as we go back in history,\n\n44\n00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.310\neven before that point in time, what you\nand I actually have to understand is\n\n45\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.750\nthat networking is not really\nthe unified way that it is done today.\n\n46\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.400\nAnd what I mean by that is that it\nwas actually a very diverse landscape\n\n47\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.690\nof different networking\nmodels that were out there.\n\n48\n00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.860\nSo let me show you what I'm talking\nabout right here on my screen and\n\n49\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.910\nthis will help us out a little bit more.\n\n50\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.467\nOkay?\nSo before the days of the OSI model, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:00.850\nWe ended up having what we call\ndifferent proprietary networking models.\n\n52\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.400\nNow let's make sure that we understand\nthe term and the idea here.\n\n53\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.480\nOkay?\nWhen we talk about proprietary,\n\n54\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.640\nthat means somebody else owned it.\n\n55\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.350\nAnd that normally, for\nat least networking,\n\n56\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.170\nusually meant some hardware vendor or some\nsoftware vendor ended up owning, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.300\nThe way that they did networking.\n\n58\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.600\nOkay?\nSo that's what you have.\n\n59\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.710\nSo you might see, if you continue to read\nblogs about the legacy networking models\n\n60\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.710\nthat are out there, you might\nhear the term vendor proprietary,\n\n61\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.040\nnetworking models, whatever it might be.\n\n62\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.420\nOkay?\nSo what you would end up\n\n63\n00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.432\nhaving then, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:35.110\nAt some point, right?\n\n65\n00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.990\nIs that someone would\nchoose a networking model?\n\n66\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.450\nSo I'll just pick on this on\nthis one on the left-hand side,\n\n67\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.930\nDEC, Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\n68\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.252\nThey came up with their\nown networking model,\n\n69\n00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:47.056\nthe way that their computers\nshould be able to network.\n\n70\n00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:52.227\nAnd so that meant that when computers\ncommunicated, so it just has the beginning\n\n71\n00:03:52.227 --> 00:03:57.333\nopening salvo of communication, as long\nas those computers spoke DEC, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:01.401\nAs their networking protocol, in other\nwords, you had two computers as long as\n\n73\n00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:05.530\nthey were using the DEC communication\nmodel, well, one would say hello.\n\n74\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.860\nRight?\nThe source.\n\n75\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.970\nAnd then the other person\non the other side or\n\n76\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.660\nthe other computer on the other\nside would understand and go, hey.\n\n77\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.480\nWe're speaking the same language.\n\n78\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.500\nWe're using the same protocols.\n\n79\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.820\nI understand what it is\nyou're communicating.\n\n80\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.500\nOkay?\n\n81\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.227\nSo that actually did end up working.\n\n82\n00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.138\nNow the problem that we have, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:28.162\nThat ends up happening as well is that\nwhen you start to actually take a look\n\n84\n00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:32.863\naround, some networks then adopted DEC,\nwhich is perfectly fine,\n\n85\n00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:37.746\nothers might have ended up adopting SNA,\nor AppleTalk, or IPX/SPX.\n\n86\n00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:38.560\nOkay?\n\n87\n00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.405\nOr even this guys down here, XNS and\nDSA, as you start doing all of these.\n\n88\n00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:43.970\nOkay?\n\n89\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.630\nAll these were actually\ndifferent companies, right?\n\n90\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.300\nSo DEC was actually DEC.\n\n91\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.620\nSNA was IBM's way of doing things.\n\n92\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.650\nAppleTalk of course was Apple,\nI would assume, yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.530\nSo you can have stuff like that as well,\n\n94\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.590\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n95\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.610\none of the things I'm thinking\nof is it seems like, boy,\n\n96\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.190\nin the earlier days of networking, it was\nkinda like the western frontier, right?\n\n97\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.830\nThe wild, wild west.\n\n98\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.320\nAnd help me out with\nthat term proprietary.\n\n99\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.210\nDoes that mean that I have\nto go to that vendor to\n\n100\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.261\nget that type of communication protocol?\n&gt;&gt; It really would be.\n\n101\n00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:14.319\nOkay?\nSo in that sense,\n\n102\n00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.142\nthis is what started to happen.\n\n103\n00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:18.463\nRight?\nIs that you had some that were early\n\n104\n00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:21.340\npeople that came out and\nstarted doing networking.\n\n105\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.400\nBut then you had other companies that\nwould look at other kind of earlier one\n\n106\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.240\nand go you wanna know something,\nwe can improve on that.\n\n107\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.350\nAnd once they started saying that,\n\n108\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.770\nthat we could improve on that,\nthey of course then actually not only\n\n109\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.990\nimproved on what they had because they had\nto change it because it was proprietary.\n\n110\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.390\nThey couldn't actually go ahead and\njust take what they had learned earlier.\n\n111\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.730\nThey had to kind of rebuild\nit from the ground up and\n\n112\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.820\nthen put their own way of doing things.\n\n113\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.430\nWell, the reason why that's important is\nthat once you end up choosing a particular\n\n114\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.930\nnetworking model, okay?\n\n115\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.800\nSo whether it didn't matter which\none you actually chose here,\n\n116\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.280\nI didn't go through and\nfinish the rest of my list here did I?\n\n117\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.790\nApple, of course, Apple Talk, IPX/SPX was\nnovelle, and then XNX, Xerox, and this DSA\n\n118\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.880\none is probably the one that's a little\nbit more on the further end of things.\n\n119\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.092\nThis is where Bell-Howell also came in and\ndid their own model of things, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:12.720\nSo it doesn't matter as far as\nthe hardware proprierty but\n\n121\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.282\nthe reason why it matters is this.\n\n122\n00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:14.906\nOkay?\n\n123\n00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:19.157\nIs that once you ended up\nessentially buying one system and\n\n124\n00:06:19.157 --> 00:06:23.671\nstarted to network your computers\ntogether with one system,\n\n125\n00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:27.834\nit pretty much guarantee that\neven if a year or two later,\n\n126\n00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:32.458\nyou found another protocol that\ndid better such as SNA, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:38.000\nOr IPX/SPX, you already had 10\ncomputers running AppleTalk.\n\n128\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.370\nIt wasn't like you were gonna migrate,\nwhat?\n\n129\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.580\nAll ten computer to a brand new system.\n\n130\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.500\nSo Wes, that next year or two years later,\nthose new computers would still have to be\n\n131\n00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.800\nrunning what?\n&gt;&gt; The same thing,\n\n132\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.597\nabsolutely.\n&gt;&gt; The same thing.\n\n133\n00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:52.147\n&gt;&gt; So it seems like almost like you would\n\n134\n00:06:52.147 --> 00:06:53.722\nget vendor locked.\n&gt;&gt; You would get vendor locked.\n\n135\n00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:54.714\n&gt;&gt; Like if I say okay,\n\n136\n00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:59.260\nI'm gonna use Apple talk, well, I better\nhave Apple proprietary implementations.\n\n137\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.800\nAnd let's just say I wanted to go with\nDEC, Digital Equipment Corporation, I have\n\n138\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.610\nto almost abandon or abandon everything\nthat supports AppleTalk and move over like\n\n139\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.980\nyou said from the ground up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n140\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.320\nso what were the chances that you\nalready spent, let's say 10,000, or 20,\n\n141\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.180\nor $30,000 implementing\nyour particular version?\n\n142\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.510\nAnd now this other guy says, we can do the\nsame thing but only really for whatever.\n\n143\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.340\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nthe costs started adding up.\n\n144\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.978\nSo let's say it's another 15,000.\n\n145\n00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:29.498\nAnd then you'd have to actually get\nall of the other old computers and\n\n146\n00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:32.690\nthen your new computers and\nthat added up to $50,000.\n\n147\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.230\nIt really did lock you in.\n&gt;&gt; I could see a CIO looking at me and\n\n148\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.344\nlaughing at me or handing me a pinkslip,\n\n149\n00:07:38.344 --> 00:07:39.483\none of the two.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n150\n00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:40.480\n&gt;&gt; Whichever one comes first.\n\n151\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.590\n&gt;&gt; So because they were so different and\n\n152\n00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.370\nthey were proprietary, they would\nnot communicate with each other.\n\n153\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.720\nSo even though their goal\nwas the same thing, right?\n\n154\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.220\nSo here it is.\n\n155\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.219\nI have hello, hello.\n&gt;&gt; Notice that DEC and\n\n156\n00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:55.060\nSNA essentially is like speaking\ndifferent languages here.\n\n157\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.578\nSame thing with bonjour and IPXs and\nSPXs, we go across this all spectrum It's\n\n158\n00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:03.418\neverybody speaking a different\nlanguage within their networks.\n\n159\n00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:06.886\nAnd it didn't actually make sense then for\nyou to go ahead and\n\n160\n00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:11.530\nupgrade your computer to even a possibly\nbetter network that was out there.\n\n161\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.610\nAnd it meant that you had to change\neverybody else in your network already\n\n162\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.420\nexisting on another protocol to\ngo to something that was better.\n\n163\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.660\nNow, some people it made sense.\n\n164\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.320\nThere were a lot of companies where\nthe expense was like, well, it does work,\n\n165\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.220\nit's not that it doesn't work, but you\nknow, we have at least the basics here.\n\n166\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.330\nWhat does it matter if it's\nactually any better or not,\n\n167\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.520\nbecause it's giving us\nfoundationally what we need.\n\n168\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.650\nSo that's where the issues\nbegan to happen.\n\n169\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.018\nNow not only did it happen on the protocol\nlevel, the software side of things, right?\n\n170\n00:08:40.018 --> 00:08:42.139\nIt even happened on\nthings like connectors.\n\n171\n00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:46.499\nSo I'm just going to use some generic\nexamples, not some real examples.\n\n172\n00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:50.243\nSo let's take from the example\nhere that IPX/SPX said look,\n\n173\n00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:55.574\nall of our connectors into the physical\nnetwork, they're going to triangular, Wes.\n\n174\n00:08:55.574 --> 00:08:59.748\nBut then AppleTalk said all of our\nconnectors are going to be round, okay?\n\n175\n00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:04.465\nSo there we go, we now have a round one\nthat actually accepts round connectors\n\n176\n00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:09.040\ninto their network and then one\nthat accepts triangular connectors.\n\n177\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.280\nSo it even got to that specificity\nwhere they didn't even share a common\n\n178\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.740\ntype of connector into network, so\nthere was no genericism to this.\n\n179\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.670\nSo that meant that if you bought into one,\nyou pretty much were locked into that.\n\n180\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.576\nAnd these protocols, themselves,\nit's not that they weren't sophisticated.\n\n181\n00:09:27.576 --> 00:09:31.643\nIPX/SPX is an insanely\nsophisticated protocol, okay, for\n\n182\n00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:33.764\nnetworking that's out there.\n\n183\n00:09:33.764 --> 00:09:37.895\nBut it was really so vendor specific,\nokay, that it really didn't make sense if\n\n184\n00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:40.839\nyou were really running\nsomething else to ever adopt it.\n\n185\n00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:44.630\nSo you had to kind of pick and\nchoose what you wanted.\n\n186\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.725\nSo when this stuff started to happen and\nthey couldn't really get any further.\n\n187\n00:09:48.725 --> 00:09:52.498\nThat meant once you locked in the company,\nwhat were the chances of you actually\n\n188\n00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:55.860\ngetting to sell across to another\ncompany to get them to bind to yours?\n\n189\n00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.710\nRelatively little,\n\n190\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.328\nand that's where you had problems.\n&gt;&gt; So in today's day and age here, Ronnie,\n\n191\n00:10:00.328 --> 00:10:01.950\nwe say diversity is a great thing.\n\n192\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.270\nDiversity is a good thing.\n\n193\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.281\nBut it looks like.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:06.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In that day,\n\n195\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.780\ndiversity wasn't a good thing.\n\n196\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.340\nSo how is it that we can bring it into\nmore of a singularity, if you will.\n\n197\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the way that it goes, right,\n\n198\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.250\nis that you have two different things\nthat can end up happening, okay?\n\n199\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:24.455\nOne is exactly what happened in the 1970s,\nthere was a group called ISO, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:28.260\nISO is not an acronym, I know it seems\nstrange but it's not an acronym,\n\n201\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.450\nit's a Greek term, equal.\n\n202\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.560\nWhich meant that everybody that wanted to\nstandardize things and across the globe\n\n203\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.940\nhere, 86 or 88 different countries came\ninto an agreement for standardization\n\n204\n00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.610\nof certain things, and networking\nwas one of those standardizations.\n\n205\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.705\nSo when they actually said, look,\nwe want to actually be able to do this,\n\n206\n00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:52.323\nto standardize networking,\nthey came up with their\n\n207\n00:10:52.323 --> 00:10:57.196\nown networking protocol called OSI,\nOpen System Interconnection.\n\n208\n00:10:57.196 --> 00:11:02.043\nThis Open System Interconnection was\nreally the attempt to get away from\n\n209\n00:11:02.043 --> 00:11:06.573\nthe vendor specific, or\nvendor proprietary networking models and\n\n210\n00:11:06.573 --> 00:11:10.210\nunite them all underneath standardization.\n\n211\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.730\nSo here it is.\n\n212\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.060\nI actually kind of get some\ngeek cred here, right?\n\n213\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.450\nOne model to rule them all, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.630\nSo if you don't know, go and\n\n215\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.630\nwatch your Lord of the Rings again and\nyou'll get back into this idea.\n\n216\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.200\nOne model to rule them all.\n\n217\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.140\nNot exactly, but\n\n218\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.830\nit was an open standard approach\nis what they actually chose to do.\n\n219\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.060\nAnd so look, we really want\neverybody to come on board for\n\n220\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.465\nthis is what they wanted.\n&gt;&gt; So standardization,\n\n221\n00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:39.365\nnow that seems like you're limiting me.\n\n222\n00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.195\nIf you say, Ronnie hey,\nwe want standardization.\n\n223\n00:11:42.195 --> 00:11:44.095\nI had all these options now, and\n\n224\n00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:47.425\nstandardization almost sounds like you're\nrestricting the amount of options I have.\n\n225\n00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.655\nBut that's not the case, right?\n&gt;&gt; No, it really isn't.\n\n226\n00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:53.545\nWhat it does is actually allows you to go,\nlook, here's what standardization does.\n\n227\n00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:57.312\nIt makes an agreement based on a lot of\ndifferent things in which they're saying,\n\n228\n00:11:57.312 --> 00:12:00.785\nlook, we're not gonna limit you\nto what should be out there.\n\n229\n00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:02.140\nLet's agree on a couple of things.\n\n230\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.720\nSo one of the things that was\nactually neat is they just agreed on\n\n231\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.710\nconnectors that were out there and said,\n\n232\n00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.450\nif you build a network, make sure it\nhas this type of connector in it.\n\n233\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.450\nWell, that meant that it did not\nmatter then, at least for connecting,\n\n234\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.000\nwhether you are running DEC or\nXNS or SNA, whatever.\n\n235\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.575\nThey said, just do this.\n\n236\n00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:21.270\nAlso, they started off with\nsomething fairly as simple as that.\n\n237\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.850\nAnd then they started to say look,\n\n238\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.560\nwhy don't you use these\nprotocols instead of your own.\n\n239\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.440\nAnd that way, what you can do is\nyou can improve on your networking.\n\n240\n00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.160\nOkay, so whatever you did to improve\non DEC, continue to improve on DEC.\n\n241\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.580\nJust use the standardizations\nthat are out there.\n\n242\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.110\nAnd base it off of that instead.\n\n243\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.260\nAnd that way, if SNA wants to directly\ncompete with you on that, they can.\n\n244\n00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.000\nAnd y'all can continue to\ncompete with each other.\n\n245\n00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.190\nAnd everybody else that's out there that's\ntrying to build whatever it is that\n\n246\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.230\nthey're wanting to build with networking.\n\n247\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.820\nBut then everybody can actually\ncompete directly head to head and\n\n248\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.746\nnobody is locked in to one vendor.\n\n249\n00:12:54.746 --> 00:12:55.994\nIt really did help.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n250\n00:12:55.994 --> 00:12:58.345\nyou're doing exactly the opposite\nof what I was thinking.\n\n251\n00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:01.093\nYou know, when it's standardization,\nyou're saying hey, here's your options.\n\n252\n00:13:01.093 --> 00:13:04.528\nYou go ahead and keep them and we'll give\nyou some kind of way that all of those\n\n253\n00:13:04.528 --> 00:13:06.580\noptions can communicate in the background.\n\n254\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.200\nAnd now me as a consumer, all I have to do\nis choose what product do I like better?\n\n255\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.160\nBecause they're gonna\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n256\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.680\nNow as a consumer, a customer,\nI can kind of choose what I want,\n\n257\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.870\nI don't have to be vendor locked to DEC or\nvendor locked to\n\n258\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.010\nsomething like IPX/SPX from Novell.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n259\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.810\nand it really does make sense, right?\n\n260\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.730\nSo this way you do, you continue to\ndevelop whatever you want to, and\n\n261\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.980\nthen certain things are ready the same\nthing the way that you want to.\n\n262\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.070\nSo it actually leads to\ninner operability as well.\n\n263\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.970\nSo let's take this for an example since\nwe have some hardware companies up here.\n\n264\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.790\nSo Wes, let's say that SNA here,\nall right, IBM.\n\n265\n00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:46.930\nThey ended up building the best network\nadapter based on the OSI model, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:52.054\nEverybody else build network adapters, but\nlet's say this, somehow their particular\n\n267\n00:13:52.054 --> 00:13:57.420\nnetwork interface card, their NIC, stood\nout heads and shoulders above the rest.\n\n268\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.770\nWell, that meant that somebody\nelse could come along and say hey,\n\n269\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.420\nwe want to complete in that market too,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n270\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.430\nbuild one that's better\nthan what they did.\n\n271\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.900\nAnd they can directly complete\nbased on that if they want to.\n\n272\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.300\nBut it also means that others that said\nlook, we don't want to actually try and\n\n273\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.560\nwin on that model.\n\n274\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.608\nWe wanna went to something else, okay?\n\n275\n00:14:14.608 --> 00:14:18.741\nWe wanna develop the best application that\nworks to deliver this from one place to\n\n276\n00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:19.830\nanother.\n\n277\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.707\nSo they could do that without actually\nhaving to put their hands in every other\n\n278\n00:14:23.707 --> 00:14:27.881\npart of it, whereas one company might go\nwe're doing better at this, so watch, so\n\n279\n00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:29.690\nyou kind of focus in and win on this.\n\n280\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.808\nAnd that meant that you could choose\nto use IPX/SPX and AppleTalk and\n\n281\n00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:38.352\nDSA all together if you wanted to,\nbecause they actually use the entire, or\n\n282\n00:14:38.352 --> 00:14:40.680\nat least the connections use it.\n\n283\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.350\nSo if you actually bought\na NIC from SNA and\n\n284\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.840\nthen you decided to use DEC standard,\nthat's fine, right?\n\n285\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.540\nBecause some of those things would\nactually allow you to do that.\n\n286\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.540\nSo that's the key here, okay?\n\n287\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.420\nSo the open system interconnection model,\nokay?\n\n288\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.232\nIt was really about trying to\nbring everybody together, but\n\n289\n00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:01.232\nit was getting them to drop this as well,\nokay?\n\n290\n00:15:01.232 --> 00:15:05.216\nTo say look, there is actually gonna\nbe a way that we can all compete,\n\n291\n00:15:05.216 --> 00:15:09.549\nand that is through standardization\nof certain elements of networking and\n\n292\n00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:12.940\nonce you do that,\nthey also offer their own model, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.610\nThey offered their own protocols.\n\n294\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.990\nThey did a bunch of things that said we've\nactually got this already set up, so\n\n295\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.320\ndon't worry about interoperability.\n\n296\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.370\nWhy don't you just switch\nover to what we want?\n\n297\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.734\nSo one model to rule them all, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:25.514\nEven though it's based\n\n299\n00:15:25.514 --> 00:15:26.749\noff standardization.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n300\n00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:29.048\neven though we're talking about\nindividual companies competing,\n\n301\n00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:31.753\nI mean, these companies could get\ntogether and collaborate together, right?\n\n302\n00:15:31.753 --> 00:15:36.121\nMaybe they say hey, we like components of\nthis functionality and components of this\n\n303\n00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:40.178\nfunctionality, hey let's take and\nget DEC and Intel and Xerox all together,\n\n304\n00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:44.320\nhave a consortium and come out with what\nwe can standardize against this model.\n\n305\n00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.346\nAnd we know that if you have this\nproduct and you use this standard,\n\n306\n00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:51.913\nthey're gonna be interoperable.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes, as that started to\n\n307\n00:15:51.913 --> 00:15:56.676\nhappen, and a bunch of the world\nreally did start to say look,\n\n308\n00:15:56.676 --> 00:16:00.450\nthat's a great thing for\neverything to happen.\n\n309\n00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.278\nAnd I moved this up, so\nthat we can see this.\n\n310\n00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:11.130\nThere was a competing open standard model\nor a competing standardizing model here.\n\n311\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:11.640\nSo this one.\n\n312\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.760\nNo, there is another.\n\n313\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.020\nHarkening back to your days of Star Wars,\nhere, and Yoda.\n\n314\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:22.020\nSo even though this was an open\nstandard model that was out there,\n\n315\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.510\nTCPIP ended up getting developed not\nonly by the Department of Defense but\n\n316\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.120\nalso of course different contractors\nas well as universities.\n\n317\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.270\nSay look, even though that's out there,\n\n318\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.150\nwe have a standardization that\nwe would rather follow instead.\n\n319\n00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.962\nAnd we'll talk about the differences and\n\n320\n00:16:38.962 --> 00:16:41.507\nthe comparison between these\nin a little bit of time here.\n\n321\n00:16:41.507 --> 00:16:46.132\nBut overall, though, at the very beginning\nwhen they started to realize that\n\n322\n00:16:46.132 --> 00:16:50.336\nthe vendor specific was locking\neverybody in, they said, here are two\n\n323\n00:16:50.336 --> 00:16:55.400\ncompeting models, then, that we can go\nwith, is what we'll end up seeing in.\n\n324\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.040\nSo this idea of another competing\nstandardizing model and\n\n325\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.750\nwe are gonna end up addressing that\nentire model in another episode, as well.\n\n326\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.204\nBut just kinda realize that that\nis a part of what happened.\n\n327\n00:17:07.204 --> 00:17:11.794\nThe nice thing about the way\nthat the OSI model ended\n\n328\n00:17:11.794 --> 00:17:16.489\nup working out here in what\nit did is that it really did\n\n329\n00:17:16.489 --> 00:17:21.810\nbegin to describe the end and\ncommunication process.\n\n330\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:27.200\nSo if you watched our very first episode\nin this series about what is networking\n\n331\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.514\nand the idea of communication, they broke\nit down to the process and to the way.\n\n332\n00:17:33.514 --> 00:17:38.220\nWhere they said, here's what we believe\nthe model of networking should be.\n\n333\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.540\nSo this way, everybody,\n\n334\n00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.900\nwhen they published it,\neverybody could develop along this path.\n\n335\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.757\nOr they could just accept whatever the OSI\nmodel said to actually develop along this\n\n336\n00:17:46.757 --> 00:17:47.540\npath, as well.\n\n337\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.830\nBut they said, here is the way\nit's actually gonna break down.\n\n338\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.305\nSo that's what we'll\nactually end up seeing here.\n\n339\n00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:58.950\nNow the OSI model itself\nthat we see today,\n\n340\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:04.850\nis not really implemented in that sense\nof actually somebody really adopting it,\n\n341\n00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.570\nthere were people that did adopt\nthe companies that did end up adopting it,\n\n342\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:12.530\nbut it really never got widely adopted,\nand so\n\n343\n00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.400\nas much as actually it got used,\nit got used more in\n\n344\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.340\nreference of the way that they believe\nthings actually ended up working out.\n\n345\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.690\nTheoretically, and a great teaching model,\nto help us to slow down and\n\n346\n00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:29.820\nunderstand every process along the way\nof that communication that we need to.\n\n347\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.140\nSo this is actually the key here\nwhen we start taking a look at\n\n348\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.450\nwhy we actually need to learn this,\nas well.\n\n349\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.270\nThe other thing that ended up happening\nbecause of this adoption in terms of\n\n350\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.860\nteaching and reference,\nit became universal at this point.\n\n351\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.900\nSo that is another factor in what\nends up happening as we start to see\n\n352\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.080\nthis, as well.\n\n353\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.271\nSo we are gonna jump in.\n\n354\n00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:53.970\nAnd we're gonna talk briefly about this.\n\n355\n00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.300\nI'm coming close to the end of time.\n\n356\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.970\nSo I'll at least describe or\nat least list these layers here.\n\n357\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.448\nAnd we'll talk about what they\ndo in a general sense here.\n\n358\n00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:05.810\nBut overall though, we'll take a look at\nexplaining how the process ends up working\n\n359\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.520\nin the next episode, as well.\n\n360\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.110\nSo when we start to take a look here,\nour goal at this point,\n\n361\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.400\nespecially when you getting ready for the\nexam, pay attention to the terminology.\n\n362\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.810\nAnd that means you having\nto learn this model.\n\n363\n00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.750\nSo what we're looking at,\n\n364\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.480\nof course, are essential what's\nin these rectangles right here.\n\n365\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.790\nAnd you also want to associate what we\ncall different layer numbers with them.\n\n366\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.770\nNow, I just have them listed as L.\n\n367\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.511\nI could have wrote out\nLater if I wanted to.\n\n368\n00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:33.733\nI was just too lazy.\n\n369\n00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:39.955\nSo I just have L7, L6, L5, L4, L3, L2, L1.\n\n370\n00:19:39.955 --> 00:19:43.796\nAlong that and also the names that\nyou also see right over here, too.\n\n371\n00:19:43.796 --> 00:19:45.369\n&gt;&gt; So that's gonna be important for\n\n372\n00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:45.880\nthe exam.\n\n373\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.170\nIf I sit in that exam and\n\n374\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.380\nI'm gonna take that very first CCNT exam,\nRonnie, you're saying,\n\n375\n00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.100\nhey, I need to know that layer seven means\nthe application layer and vice-versa,\n\n376\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.880\nso memorize it forwards and backwards.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, make sure you know this model,\n\n377\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.892\nand Wes makes a very strong and\nimportant point here.\n\n378\n00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:08.145\nYou need to know it whether we're\nactually talking about from the beginning\n\n379\n00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:12.427\nof layer 1, going through layer 7,\nor layer 7 to layer 1.\n\n380\n00:20:12.427 --> 00:20:16.820\nBut make sure you also learn about\nwhat each of these layers do.\n\n381\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.270\nAnd we, of course, are gonna talk\nabout them in terms of their function,\n\n382\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.860\nwe're gonna mention what\nprotocols actually run on them,\n\n383\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.960\nsome of them will have some,\nsome of them won't.\n\n384\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.100\nAnd even devices, as well.\n\n385\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.830\nSo the great thing is we're gonna\nfill out this chart as we go through,\n\n386\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.620\nbecause it's gonna be important\nthat you know these things, too.\n\n387\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.143\nBut we do wanna make sure that\nwe understand as we cover that,\n\n388\n00:20:37.143 --> 00:20:38.813\nthat you're at this point.\n\n389\n00:20:38.813 --> 00:20:43.609\nBecause you might not know, really,\nanything about the basics of networking.\n\n390\n00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:47.833\nYou might not even see its use, but\nas you start to go through this show and\n\n391\n00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:51.364\nas you get into everything else\nthat you do in your IT career,\n\n392\n00:20:51.364 --> 00:20:54.916\nthe LSI model is something that\nwe deal with on a daily basis.\n\n393\n00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:56.547\nAnd as much as it is just a reference,\n\n394\n00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.930\nit's easy enough to\ntroubleshoot using this too.\n\n395\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.561\nAnd there's a lot more for us to learn.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you said that we probably go\n\n396\n00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.180\ninto a part two,\nas you fill in more of this information.\n\n397\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.780\nThere's a lot of information here, Ronnie.\n\n398\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.520\nNow, help me out.\n\n399\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.150\nIf I'm studying at home, should I be\nfeverishly taking down notes to try\n\n400\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:16.090\nto keep this information under my belt?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can, but\n\n401\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.030\nyou don't really have to.\n\n402\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.760\nNow, I recommend, of course,\nthat you take your own notes if you can.\n\n403\n00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.730\nThese will also appear in\nthe show notes that will be with\n\n404\n00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.450\neach of the episodes, as well.\n\n405\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.880\nSo you shouldn't have to worry about\nit if you're actually in a hurry,\n\n406\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.100\nif you miss something.\n\n407\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.390\nI do recommend that you take notes,\nas much as you can,\n\n408\n00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.050\nbecause it just helps reinforce\nthe concepts that we're going over.\n\n409\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.300\nBut right now, let's turn back\nto our screen here just for\n\n410\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.350\na moment, as we get this process going.\n\n411\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.210\nSo you make sure that you actually\nlearn this entire model and\n\n412\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.400\nthe way that it works.\n\n413\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.340\nYou and I, Wes, we're gonna break this\ndown and actually go through the process\n\n414\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.340\nof how a packet actually gets from\nthe source to the destination.\n\n415\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.240\nWe'll see that as well,\nas well as filling out this model.\n\n416\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.360\nTalking about what each\nlayer actually does, too.\n\n417\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.270\nNow, before we do that,\nsince we've got a few minutes left,\n\n418\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.660\nI want to break this down in\nthe most generic way that I can.\n\n419\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.410\nAnd we're taking a look at the left\nside of the screen right now.\n\n420\n00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:21.410\nWhen you start to take a look at\nthe breakdown of the way that this ends\n\n421\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:27.464\nup working on a computer and what ends up\nhappening is that with the 7 layers here,\n\n422\n00:22:27.464 --> 00:22:33.293\nthe first, or at least depending on how\nyou wanna do it, layers 5 through 7.\n\n423\n00:22:33.293 --> 00:22:36.773\nI don't know, I always call it the first,\nand then saying, well, that's layer 7.\n\n424\n00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:38.250\nIs that the last or not?\n\n425\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.490\nIt just depends on how you look at it,\nso it's up to you.\n\n426\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:49.490\nBut on these layers up here, this all\nnormally occurs on the single computer.\n\n427\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.250\nAnd that's kinda the key.\n\n428\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.900\nAnd what is going on during this process\nand the initial what's unusually called\n\n429\n00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.451\nthe application block is not a term\nthat you tend to use inside of Cisco but\n\n430\n00:23:00.451 --> 00:23:04.950\nwhat they're is to hang is what\nare these three layers about.\n\n431\n00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.750\nIn general,\n\n432\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:11.050\nthey are preparing the data for\nthe destination computer to understand.\n\n433\n00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.883\nSo the information that's also being\nadded here at this point as we're\n\n434\n00:23:15.883 --> 00:23:20.713\nprocessing it through to get put\nonto the network, it is saying, hey,\n\n435\n00:23:20.713 --> 00:23:24.256\nall this stuff is about\nensuring that the other end,\n\n436\n00:23:24.256 --> 00:23:27.986\nthat the destination computer\nknows what is going on.\n\n437\n00:23:27.986 --> 00:23:32.150\nSo that's why it's actually\npreparing it for the destination.\n\n438\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:38.570\nThe lower four layers here is all\nabout preparing it for delivery.\n\n439\n00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.110\nNow, I want you to\nunderstand that process,\n\n440\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.230\ncuz it's very easy to misunderstand.\n\n441\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:48.491\nRemember, this is for the destination\ncomputer, this is essentially preparing\n\n442\n00:23:48.491 --> 00:23:53.765\nit for the network itself so that it can\nbe delivered properly to the destination.\n\n443\n00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:58.648\nSo the additional information that you see\ndown here at layers 4 through 1 here is\n\n444\n00:23:58.648 --> 00:24:03.176\nall about ensuring that the data can\nactually not only be on the network, But\n\n445\n00:24:03.176 --> 00:24:05.610\nit knows exactly where it's destined.\n\n446\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.430\nIt knows how to get it there.\n\n447\n00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.310\nAnd then it changes it into something\nthat's physical that can be then put on\n\n448\n00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.300\na wire, and then transmitted across,\nor in the air, whatever it might be.\n\n449\n00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.440\nSo when we start to\nactually take a look at it.\n\n450\n00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.660\nSo that's why they call this part\nup here the application block.\n\n451\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.290\nThat usually is on one computer and\nthen as it starts leaving a computer,\n\n452\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.210\nwhich we'll get into.\n\n453\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.610\nThis is all about making sure that the\ndata is ready on the network, and that we\n\n454\n00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:37.220\ndon't put any data out on to the network\nthat it doesn't know where it's going.\n\n455\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.510\nAnd that's a key process\nin what will be doing.\n\n456\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.410\nSo Wes,\nwhen we get back with our part two,\n\n457\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.570\nwe'll be taking a look\nat that entire process.\n\n458\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.720\nAnd then also, of course, filling out\nthis chart that's gonna be important.\n\n459\n00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.700\nAnd no matter what, and the great thing\nis, for those of you that have already sat\n\n460\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.068\nthrough like the Comp TIA Network+,\nyou've been hit with this in the face.\n\n461\n00:25:00.068 --> 00:25:03.830\nAnd you're gonna get with it\nin the face one more time\n\n462\n00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.440\nbecause that's how important it is.\n\n463\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.420\nI don't know how else to emphasize this.\n\n464\n00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.960\nBut memorize that model.\n\n465\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.230\nFor now, if you don't do anything else,\nmemorize it.\n\n466\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.300\nThere's plenty of mnemonics\nthere that will help you.\n\n467\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.380\nSo you name it, just take the first letter\nof everything that you have there and\n\n468\n00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.160\nyou can actually see some.\n\n469\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.560\nLet's go ahead and just talk\nabout a couple of them right now,\n\n470\n00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.390\ncuz do you have a favorite one?\n&gt;&gt; I do, absolutely.\n\n471\n00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.040\nI'm sitting here and\none's going through my head.\n\n472\n00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.940\nAnd I'm gonna do the same thing and\nsay the first layer, top layer, so\n\n473\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.680\nwe got that right.\n\n474\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.830\nI do the same thing.\n\n475\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:39.370\nAll people seem to need data processing.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n476\n00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.050\nyep, so you have something like that.\n\n477\n00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.340\nNow you and I work with Dan Lowry, right?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n478\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.610\n&gt;&gt; The unusual thing is\n\n479\n00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.430\nDan taught me the one that\nsomebody told him, which is weird.\n\n480\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:56.740\nAll people seem to need Dan Lowrie\nphysically, that's what he said.\n\n481\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.200\nCuz Dan's a huge guy, he's a big guy.\n\n482\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.190\nSo I always remember that one.\n\n483\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.230\nAnd then, of course, you have the other\nway that you can also do this.\n\n484\n00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.990\nPlease do not throw sausage pizza away.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n485\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.586\ndon't do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do that.\n\n486\n00:26:10.586 --> 00:26:13.230\nNow, I use food analogies\nbecause I like food.\n\n487\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.740\nBut there's plenty of other ones\nout there that you wanna memorize,\n\n488\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.600\nbut at least get that memorization down.\n\n489\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.620\nThat's gonna help you out\non the exam tremendously.\n\n490\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.500\nEven if you only know that,\nthat's gonna help you out.\n\n491\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.890\nBut you wanna learn this entire process\nand understand what functions, what each\n\n492\n00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:33.050\nlayer actually functions as, protocols\nassociated, as well as different devices.\n\n493\n00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.940\nSo we've still got that to go, and\nwe've still got the entire process\n\n494\n00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.780\nof why this is important.\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, looking forward to\n\n495\n00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.330\ncoming back and looking at Open Systems\nand Interconnection Model part two,\n\n496\n00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.400\nwhere we can hit you with a whole bunch of\nacronyms It's very very important stuff.\n\n497\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.030\nRonnie as always, we appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios, and\n\n498\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.840\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n499\n00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.470\nKeep in mind you're gonna have\nto stay tuned for a part two.\n\n500\n00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.970\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n501\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n502\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.739\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n503\n00:26:58.739 --> 00:27:05.910\n[MUSIC]\n\n504\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.035\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.351\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:12.360\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.119\nand welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.254\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:22.628\nwe're actually continuing through our\nCisco CSEMT, back with a part two.\n\n8\n00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:25.728\nFirst part, we laid the foundations for\nwhat's known as the open systems\n\n9\n00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.625\ninterconnection model, but\nwe left you with a cliffhanger.\n\n10\n00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:31.003\nSo back to round up these topics is Mr.\nRonnie Wong, Ronnie,\n\n11\n00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.577\nhow are we doing today, sir?\n&gt;&gt; We are doing great, Wes,\n\n12\n00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:37.625\nas we continue to take a look at one of\nthe most important aspects of learning\n\n13\n00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.550\nabout networking, okay?\n\n14\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.928\nIf you don't understand the OSI model and\nyou're still struggling with this,\n\n15\n00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:47.785\nremember that you're actually gonna\nsee more use and application for\n\n16\n00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:51.141\nit as you continue to actually\ndive deeper into networking.\n\n17\n00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.075\nSo it's a little bit\ndifficult at the beginning,\n\n18\n00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.760\nbecause it just seems like a lot\nof stuff you have to memorize.\n\n19\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.170\nOne, it is, okay, so\nI'm not gonna lie to you about that.\n\n20\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.570\nBut secondly, though,\n\n21\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.180\nthere is no doubt that this is something\nwe use just about on a daily basis.\n\n22\n00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.668\nIn just about everything that we do,\n\n23\n00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:09.548\nespecially when I'm creating labs,\nI wanna know where just something\n\n24\n00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:12.125\nisn't functioning.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I know over the years, I've\n\n25\n00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:15.670\ncome to you with an issue and I'm like,\nRonnie, hey, can you help me with this?\n\n26\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.058\nAnd you say, okay, what layer did you\ncheck, did you check the physical layer?\n\n27\n00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:23.188\nAnd I know that is a direct reference back\nto everything that we're talking about in\n\n28\n00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:24.088\nthese episodes.\n\n29\n00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:26.861\nSo like Ronnie says,\nthis is very important, but\n\n30\n00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:28.982\nthat might not make much sense to you.\n\n31\n00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:32.065\nSo Ronnie, you're here to fill\nin some of those layers, so\n\n32\n00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:36.084\nthat we understand what's going on.\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're gonna make sure that we\n\n33\n00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:39.460\ndo this and show you the importance and\nthe reason behind this.\n\n34\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.643\nBut at the beginning,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n35\n00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:45.887\nAnd we're going to essentially\nfill out the rest of this table,\n\n36\n00:01:45.887 --> 00:01:50.854\nbecause you need to know what each\nlayer actually does, okay, by itself.\n\n37\n00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:54.788\nAnd then, of course, not only protocols\nthat you tend to run with that, but\n\n38\n00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:56.520\nalso different devices as well.\n\n39\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280\nSo that's what we're also gonna see,\n\n40\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.320\nif there's actually different\ndevices out there for them.\n\n41\n00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.530\nSo if they're not,\nI'll just kind of leave them blank.\n\n42\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.220\nBut we need to, at least,\n\n43\n00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.320\nfocus in a little bit on each\none of these layers here.\n\n44\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.180\nNow I'm gonna begin actually probably\nmore easily here, at the bottom and\n\n45\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.530\nthen start filling in from the top.\n\n46\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.470\nCuz people tend to understand that\na little bit easier at the beginning\n\n47\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.830\nof networking than when they actually\nstart to take a look at it the other way.\n\n48\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.400\nSo let's talk about the functionality of\neach one of these different layers first.\n\n49\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.827\nSo when we first start, and we take a look\nat the idea of the physical layer itself.\n\n50\n00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:39.548\nOkay, what we wanna do is we\nwanna talk about media pathways,\n\n51\n00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:43.140\nokay, media and pathways here.\n\n52\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.740\nAnd what we mean by\nthe function of the OSI model\n\n53\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.980\nis that the data itself that\nwe end up trying to send,\n\n54\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.610\nit has to have a pathway to get from\nthe source to the destination itself.\n\n55\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.904\nThis is true whether we're\ntalking about copper media,\n\n56\n00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:03.366\nwhether we're talking about fiber optic,\nwhether we're talking about wireless.\n\n57\n00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:06.732\nWhatever it might be,\nthat is using some type of media, so\n\n58\n00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:09.320\nwireless is gonna be radio frequency.\n\n59\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.660\nIf you're doing light,\nit's gonna be that as well in terms of\n\n60\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.000\nthe way that it goes down in terms of\ndifferent cabling that we might have.\n\n61\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.760\nBut the OSI model really does that, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.390\nIt helps us to make sure that\nwe end up taking a look, and\n\n63\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.730\nthat we have what's needed for\nthat communication process to begin.\n\n64\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.320\nNow once we get to that point,\n\n65\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.090\nthere's not really any protocols\nthat are used here, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.310\nBut in terms of devices,\n\n67\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.650\nthis is where we're gonna have to kinda\nlook behind my head a little bit here.\n\n68\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.096\nAnd let me kind of copy that over,\nin terms of the devices there are, well,\n\n69\n00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:44.168\nseveral of them.\n\n70\n00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:49.312\nAnd I've already mentioned some of them,\nso we have cabling.\n\n71\n00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:53.997\nSo regardless of what type of cabling,\nconnectors,\n\n72\n00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:58.400\ngenerally, and then lights and hubs.\n\n73\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.820\nAnd we'll talk about the idea\nof hubs a little bit later on,\n\n74\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.520\nwhen we get into switching as well.\n\n75\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.550\nBut those are some of the different\ndevices that are also associated.\n\n76\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.520\nNot really anything to do with protocols,\nbecause that is normally some\n\n77\n00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.959\ntype of decision making that has to be\ndone when we start dealing with protocols.\n\n78\n00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.516\nThe physical layer is only about making\nsure that data can get from one location\n\n79\n00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:22.452\nto the other, okay, by having that\nphysical pathway ready to go and\n\n80\n00:04:22.452 --> 00:04:24.989\navailable for us.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is it safe to say that this is\n\n81\n00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:27.647\nwhere things like the electrical\ncommunications happen and stuff?\n\n82\n00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:29.646\nAnd I know when I think of\nelectrical communications,\n\n83\n00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:30.910\nwe automatically think cabling.\n\n84\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.030\nBut like we've talked about on other\nepisodes, could be the unbound radiated\n\n85\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.710\nenergy as well.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, signaling, cabling, you\n\n86\n00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.782\nname it, anything like that that's what\nwe're also talking about here too, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:45.385\nNow once we start moving up into the data\nlink layer, okay, this is where it gets\n\n88\n00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:50.278\na little bit more mystical in some sense,\nat least to me, it's actually mystical.\n\n89\n00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:54.426\nIt may not be mystical to anybody else,\nbut this is where data gets changed into,\n\n90\n00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:56.989\nwell, something that's\ngonna be transmitted,\n\n91\n00:04:56.989 --> 00:05:00.160\nwhether it's what Wes was\ntalking about signaling.\n\n92\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.270\nSo when it exists on my computer alone,\nokay, as it exists in the form of\n\n93\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.110\na file or whatever it might be,\nokay, the data is there.\n\n94\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.080\nBut it has to be put on\nto some type of media or\n\n95\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.440\ntranslated into radio frequency,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n96\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.050\nThis is the layer that helps us to do this\nas well, so one, it has that aspect of it.\n\n97\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.900\nMaking sure that it gets translated\ninto whatever it can be to be put\n\n98\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.770\non to that media, okay,\nso that's what it does.\n\n99\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.188\nThe second part of this, of course, is\nmaking sure that it actually does forward\n\n100\n00:05:36.188 --> 00:05:41.141\nthe data towards, okay, the device\nthat will get it to its destination.\n\n101\n00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.277\nSo this is what we call, of course,\nthe idea here of forwarding.\n\n102\n00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:54.702\nForwarding to the next device, okay, that\nis pretty much what it does it here, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:58.433\nNow, you'll also hear the term that\nit also does what we call layer two\n\n104\n00:05:58.433 --> 00:05:59.540\naddressing.\n\n105\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.456\nWe're not gonna get into that yet\nfor right now,\n\n106\n00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:04.460\nbut we will a little bit later on.\n\n107\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.430\nBut just kind of understand\nits function at this point.\n\n108\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.410\nFrom the way that you and\n\n109\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.790\nI are describing it, okay, is that we are\nnow getting two things going on, right?\n\n110\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.320\nOne is making sure that\nthe data can arrive at the next\n\n111\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.010\ndestination device that it needs to, or\n\n112\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.760\nnext hop along the path that it needs to\nto get it to its ultimate destination.\n\n113\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.040\nAnd then we also, of course,\nhave changed it into something\n\n114\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.330\nthat can go onto the media itself,\nokay, so that's what we have here.\n\n115\n00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.930\nThen we have of course, well, networking\nlayer, and this is all about addressing.\n\n116\n00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.808\nOkay, now, the idea of the addressing\nmeans that it's going to\n\n117\n00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:51.818\nhave information that will help us in\ndetermining its final destination.\n\n118\n00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:55.290\nSo it's not just about getting\nthe data from one place to the next,\n\n119\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.346\nwhich is what the data link layer does.\n\n120\n00:06:57.346 --> 00:07:03.580\nIt is the ultimate destination,\nis where this particular layer comes in.\n\n121\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.860\nThe information attached at\nthis layer actually has that.\n\n122\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.159\nIt has that last step or that final\ndestination of what it needs to, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:17.779\nThen as we continue to move up in this\nlayer, called the transport layer,\n\n124\n00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.890\nthis does many different functions here.\n\n125\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.360\nNow, I'm just gonna focus in on one for\n\n126\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.640\nright now,\nwhich is what we call segmentation, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.590\nNow, what do I mean by segmentation?\n\n128\n00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.210\nRemember we talked about those\ndifferent network protocols,\n\n129\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.730\nand the way that they did certain things,\nright?\n\n130\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:43.255\nAnd the way that the OSI model also ends\nup working is that there is a certain\n\n131\n00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:48.951\nmaximum size of the amount of data\nthat we can put onto a network.\n\n132\n00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:54.822\nSo what if I have information that\nis larger than that data size?\n\n133\n00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:59.249\nWell, that's when we have to chop\nit up into smaller blocks of data.\n\n134\n00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:01.760\nSo then it can actually\nbe put on the network.\n\n135\n00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.281\nBecause the network itself physically, or\nthe way that it actually works at these\n\n136\n00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:10.370\nlower layers, may not accept\npackets that are super gigantic.\n\n137\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:15.110\nSo the transport layer helps us in\nsegmentation by breaking it up into\n\n138\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.490\nsmaller units of data that can be\nproperly addressed, properly forwarded\n\n139\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.460\nit to the next point, and then out on\nto the physical layer as well, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.080\nSo that segmentation helps us out.\n\n141\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.040\nWell, you can also add in,\nat this point, sequencing.\n\n142\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.340\nWhat if I actually take\none big chunk of data,\n\n143\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.410\nand now actually have it chopped up\ninto ten different blocks, right?\n\n144\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.610\nWell, on the destination side of things,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n145\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.780\nThat means I can actually\nreceive them in theory,\n\n146\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.506\nall ten of those blocks\nbeing out of order.\n\n147\n00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:51.704\nBy putting sequencing information\non each one of those blocks,\n\n148\n00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:56.303\nwe can then re-sequence them and\nput them into the right sequencing.\n\n149\n00:08:56.303 --> 00:09:00.282\nSo that then they can go ahead and\nalso be put back\n\n150\n00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:04.280\nin the size data it needs to.\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, I would like to,\n\n151\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.960\nif I could, kinda bring this back to the\npart one there where you talking about,\n\n152\n00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.770\nit truly does seem like everything in\nthese four layers that you're explaining\n\n153\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.100\nis all about getting that\ninformation from end to end.\n\n154\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.740\nJust everything in those\nfirst four layers.\n\n155\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, it really is.\n\n156\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.120\nSo this is all about preparing\nthat data for the network.\n\n157\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.650\nAnd so if it's not the proper size,\nit's not prepared.\n\n158\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.530\nAnd it doesn't know where it's\nultimately going, it's not prepared.\n\n159\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.270\nWe don't have enough information to\nmake sure that it can be forwarded\n\n160\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.747\nalong the data path to where it\nneeds to go, it's not prepared.\n\n161\n00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:38.850\nIf we can't get it onto the wire,\nit's not prepared.\n\n162\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.190\nSo this is where those lower four layers\nreally do shine and what we need it to do\n\n163\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.880\nhere so that we can get the data\nreally ready for network delivery.\n\n164\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.580\nNow, at this point,\nwe also have the session layer, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.834\nNow once we get into session layer,\nthis is where it's\n\n166\n00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:59.295\nactually going to be the information\nthat the destination computer has for\n\n167\n00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.298\nthe receiving computer, okay?\n\n168\n00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:04.949\nUnderstand that they are actually the two\ncomputers that are communicating, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:07.938\nThat they actually put information\nat the beginning here and\n\n170\n00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:09.403\nalso at the receiving end, so\n\n171\n00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:13.226\nthat they know that they're the ones\nthat are supposed to be communicating.\n\n172\n00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:17.951\nSo a lot of the stuff that happens here\nin terms of the session is it actually\n\n173\n00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.481\nestablishes for us synchronization.\n\n174\n00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:25.843\nAnd even ports.\n\n175\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.290\nSo they know that they're actually\nconnecting and using the proper\n\n176\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.330\nsynchronization, let me see if I can\nactually get that [LAUGH] with the comma.\n\n177\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.470\nThere we go, synchronization.\n\n178\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.357\nAnd different logical ports I guess is\nprobably the proper way to describe this.\n\n179\n00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:52.120\nAnd logical ports here, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.300\nSo that is a part of what it does.\n\n181\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.390\nThe synchronization is important\nbecause we don't want to actually\n\n182\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.913\nnot be synchronized as we start to make\nthat connection with the other side.\n\n183\n00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:07.402\nThe reason why the synchronization is also\nimportant is so that we know that we not\n\n184\n00:11:07.402 --> 00:11:11.099\nonly have that connection to the other\nside but that we can also go,\n\n185\n00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:14.878\nI know that the other side's ready\nto receive the information too.\n\n186\n00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:17.780\nSo we have that ready to go.\n\n187\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.855\nPresentation here is all about\nformating and encryption.\n\n188\n00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:27.366\nNow this is also important as well.\n\n189\n00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:32.123\nBecause the data that we have has\nto be put into a particular format\n\n190\n00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:35.064\nthat can be understood on the network and\n\n191\n00:11:35.064 --> 00:11:39.770\nthen translated back on\nthe receiving side computer to go.\n\n192\n00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.700\nThat's what this particular data\nbelongs to in terms of an application.\n\n193\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:51.753\nAnd then lastly here,\nwhen we get up into the application layer,\n\n194\n00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:55.988\nwe now have a program,\nokay, that creates and\n\n195\n00:11:55.988 --> 00:12:01.220\nopens the data that actually\nbeen received here, okay?\n\n196\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.208\nSo each one of these does form, let me see\nif I can stretch that out a little bit cuz\n\n197\n00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.761\nI'm getting a little bit crowded here.\n\n198\n00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:12.410\nYeah, that'll work for right now, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.940\nSo each one of them ends\nup actually providing\n\n200\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.790\nthese types of functions that we see here.\n\n201\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.890\nNow, you will be able to download.\n\n202\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.380\nI know, if you go to Cisco's website and\nI'll see if I can find the link.\n\n203\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.110\nI don't know if I actually put them in\nthe show notes or not, but they have,\n\n204\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.490\nof course, their official sheet.\n\n205\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.196\nYou're getting the Ronnie Wong version\nof this is what you're getting.\n\n206\n00:12:33.196 --> 00:12:36.918\nThat's kind of very summarized here,\nokay, that can help you out.\n\n207\n00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:40.811\nBut you're actually starting to see that\nwhen you start talking about the idea of\n\n208\n00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:43.616\nwhat happens, creates and\nopens the data, formatting,\n\n209\n00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:47.010\nsynchronization, you're still going like,\nI still don't get it.\n\n210\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.950\nWell, don't worry about it until we\nget to the next bit of what we need.\n\n211\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.760\nThat will help you understand\na little bit better.\n\n212\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.732\nBut we're at least giving you chunks of\nknowledge that you need to associate with\n\n213\n00:12:55.732 --> 00:12:57.184\neach layer at this point.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n214\n00:12:57.184 --> 00:12:59.531\nI'm gonna give you a little\nbit of kudos here.\n\n215\n00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:03.410\nI think I'm starting to understand why you\nkeep calling layer seven that first layer.\n\n216\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.410\nNow am I right on this?\n\n217\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.770\nThe application layer seems like almost,\nit's really the only\n\n218\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.280\nlayer that the user interacts with.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah, at this point here,\n\n219\n00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.680\nwe'll get to that when we get into\nthe idea of what we call encapsulation\n\n220\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.940\nas we send data.\n\n221\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.900\nBut you are right.\n\n222\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.720\nUsually, the other description\nbehind the application layer\n\n223\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.620\nis exactly what Wes said, here.\n\n224\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.210\nThat it's the layer that\nthe user interacts with.\n\n225\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.020\nNow you might be wondering\nabout why is that important?\n\n226\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.400\nWhy do we wanna emphasize that?\n\n227\n00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.980\nBecause it means the rest\nof the networking layers,\n\n228\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.870\nlayer six all the way down to layer one,\nis transparent to the end user.\n\n229\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.180\nThat means they don't have to know\nanything about networking at all.\n\n230\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.799\nThe user that's sitting there on their\ncomputer trying to get a web page,\n\n231\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.340\nIf they've never dealt with networking,\nWes, do you know?\n\n232\n00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.120\nAgain, let's take for an example,\nlike a relative of ours, right?\n\n233\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.580\nSo let's say that you have an aunt,\n\n234\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.930\nthat says,\nI don't know anything about networking but\n\n235\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.910\ncan you tell her how to get to a website?\n&gt;&gt; Man, I tell you,\n\n236\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.370\nI might be able to do that and it might\nbe a bad day at the end of the day.\n\n237\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.160\n&gt;&gt; Normally, though,\n\n238\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.950\nwe can just say, yeah.\n\n239\n00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:16.024\nAll you have to do is open the browser and\nget to www.itpro.tv, right?\n\n240\n00:14:16.024 --> 00:14:19.426\nShe can open up the web browser and\nthen she can type that in and\n\n241\n00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:20.646\nthat gets her where?\n\n242\n00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:21.836\nRight to a-\n&gt;&gt; Gets her to the website?\n\n243\n00:14:21.836 --> 00:14:24.940\nAbsolutely, so it is basic in that fact\nthat they don't have to understand\n\n244\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.716\nthe inner workings of the network\nto be able to get to that website.\n\n245\n00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n246\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.503\nIf you think about it,\n\n247\n00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:32.783\ndoes she knkow anything about\nlayer six through layer one?\n\n248\n00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:36.024\nNo, she doesn't know anything\nabout layer six through layer one.\n\n249\n00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:38.873\nThe application there is the only\nthing that she has know about,\n\n250\n00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:39.835\nwhich is a browswer.\n\n251\n00:14:39.835 --> 00:14:41.720\nAnd the only thing she's\ndoing in the browser's what?\n\n252\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.180\nTyping in the address in the address bar.\n\n253\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.586\nSo it does make essentially the rest of\nthese layers transparent to whoever's\n\n254\n00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:50.465\nactually doing the networking.\n\n255\n00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:54.388\nBut this is actually really good because\nit does show you that separation and\n\n256\n00:14:54.388 --> 00:14:56.362\nthings that you also have to do, too.\n\n257\n00:14:56.362 --> 00:15:00.390\nAll right, so let's also associate\nsome different protocols here.\n\n258\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.700\nSo as an example,\nthe one that we just used, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.220\nSo we talked about web pages,\nwe're usually talking about HTTP,\n\n260\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:13.090\nHTTPS, and even things like mail,\nwhich is gonna be SMTP.\n\n261\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.440\nNow, if you are saying,\nI don't know what those are,\n\n262\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.640\nwe will be addressing them\na little bit later on.\n\n263\n00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.440\nBut go ahead and\nmake sure that you get them down for\n\n264\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.420\nright now because it is going\nto be helpful as you study.\n\n265\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.120\nThat way you don't have to come back and\nchase the information later on.\n\n266\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.100\nAs we go down to the presentation layer,\n\n267\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.400\nthese are normally the file\nformats that you might hear about.\n\n268\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.514\nLet me see if I can move this\ntextbox out of the way here.\n\n269\n00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:49.122\nSo under Formatting and Encryption,\nyou might hear about things like .jpegs,\n\n270\n00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:51.368\nwhich I can't spell, [LAUGH] .jpegs.\n\n271\n00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:56.204\n[LAUGH] Or .jpgs here,\ndepending on how you do it, or .jpegs.\n\n272\n00:15:56.204 --> 00:16:00.009\nIf you hear about ascii, is another one.\n\n273\n00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:03.119\nGifs I know it's funny,\nbut that's exactly,\n\n274\n00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:07.176\nthe guy that actually made it,\nthat's how he pronounces it.\n\n275\n00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:10.920\nAnd then .tiffs as well.\n\n276\n00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.290\nThose are all different\nformats that you might also,\n\n277\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.220\nwell, I don't know why it's\nnot allowing me to do that.\n\n278\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:24.880\nHoping that it would actually be on two\nWell, I don't guess it's gonna do that.\n\n279\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.860\nAll right, just whatever we can do then.\n\n280\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.566\nOn the session layer we have\ndifferent protocols down here too.\n\n281\n00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:41.312\nNow this is where you might\nhear the term NFS for\n\n282\n00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:46.188\nnetwork file system, RPC for\nremote procedure call.\n\n283\n00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:50.728\nSQL also works on layer five,\nand even NetBIOS,\n\n284\n00:16:50.728 --> 00:16:55.833\nwhich is another unusual\nnetworking protocol for us.\n\n285\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.790\nBut all of those are actually there.\n\n286\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.700\nNow some of these,\nif you go out onto the Internet and\n\n287\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.490\nyou start finding different OSI models,\nthey're not all gonna be listed the same.\n\n288\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.990\nEverybody lists just a sampling\nof what is possible out there.\n\n289\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.895\nSo the one that I'm giving you is usually\nmore Cisco oriented than some of the ones\n\n290\n00:17:14.895 --> 00:17:18.860\nyou'll actually end up seeing that's\nrelatively generic out there, as well.\n\n291\n00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:26.144\nIn the transport layer,\nthere's really kind of a few here,\n\n292\n00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:31.301\nbut the two major ones,\nTCP, which we'll talk about\n\n293\n00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:35.901\nas well as UDP, and\nthen even for us here, SPX.\n\n294\n00:17:39.664 --> 00:17:41.260\nWhich I can't spell, SPX.\n\n295\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.849\nI can't believe it, I misspelled SPX.\n\n296\n00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:45.026\nThat was really embarrassing.\n\n297\n00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:53.720\n[LAUGH] All right, For addressing today,\nthere's really only one.\n\n298\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.170\nBut in Cisco ones that you see here,\nyou're gonna see not only IP, but\n\n299\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.100\nIPX, are usually the ones that you see.\n\n300\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.504\nYou can also see ARP.\n\n301\n00:18:04.703 --> 00:18:05.853\nAnd ICMP.\n\n302\n00:18:14.879 --> 00:18:19.550\nAnd then we'll continue to move down here,\nassociating in different protocols here.\n\n303\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:25.359\nAt layer two you'll have\nthings like Ethernet,\n\n304\n00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:32.025\nFrame Relay, point to point protocol,\nor PPP, HDLC.\n\n305\n00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:36.492\nAll right,\n\n306\n00:18:36.492 --> 00:18:41.820\nthose are kind of the big ones that you\nactually end up seeing there at layer two.\n\n307\n00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:48.810\nAnd then we won't have any protocols\ndown here for the actual physical layer.\n\n308\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:54.130\nSo all this, as we continue to march on\nthrough here, it is a little bit squished.\n\n309\n00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.000\nI'll kind of erase some of the stuff here.\n\n310\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.939\nI was trying to keep it all on the screen,\nbut I may not be able to.\n\n311\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.926\nSo that we can move some things over.\n\n312\n00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:08.730\nAll right, so\n\n313\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.465\nthose are really major pieces of\ninformation that you definitely need to\n\n314\n00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:19.590\nmake sure that you're paying attention to\nas you continue to learn more about this.\n\n315\n00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.810\nSo when you study, make sure you go\nback and you put in this information.\n\n316\n00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.810\nAnd like I said, if you take a look,\nespecially on Cisco,\n\n317\n00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.540\nthey'll have one that's probably\nmore official than what I'm doing.\n\n318\n00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:35.171\nI'm really giving you the real Ronnie Wong\nversion of [LAUGH] things here.\n\n319\n00:19:35.171 --> 00:19:36.810\nWhich, I'm not saying that they're wrong,\n\n320\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.200\nbut they're probably not described in\nthe same way that you'll see officially.\n\n321\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.470\nNow we also need to pay\nattention to these devices, too.\n\n322\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.850\nNow the only one I actually\nput on the physical devices,\n\n323\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.680\nat the physical layer here,\ndown at the lower right hand corner.\n\n324\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.880\nSo now,\nwe'll actually kind of move back up and\n\n325\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.610\nwe'll also fill out this idea of Devices,\nas well.\n\n326\n00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.800\nAt the Data Link layer,\n\n327\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:04.310\nthis is where it becomes a little\nbit more unusual at certain things.\n\n328\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.679\nNICs, which is network interface cards,\nand then for us, Layer 2 switches.\n\n329\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.092\nGonna do L2 Switches.\n\n330\n00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:14.860\nHelped saves some space over here.\n\n331\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.710\nSo when we start talking about routers and\n\n332\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.870\nswitches, we'll actually see that\nswitches themselves work at layer two.\n\n333\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:28.200\nFor us, at layer 3, it is going to be,\nwell, really routers.\n\n334\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.897\nAnd there is actually even\nlayer 3 switches, but\n\n335\n00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:33.735\nwe will just put in Routers here,\nis what we'll do.\n\n336\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.224\nSo routers are actually devices\nthat function at layer three.\n\n337\n00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.436\nAnd then at layer four.\n\n338\n00:20:47.696 --> 00:20:52.670\nYou also of course have firewalls and\nthen individual host devices.\n\n339\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.490\nOkay, now what we mean by that\nare computers that do work at layer four,\n\n340\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.690\nas far as networking goes.\n\n341\n00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.760\nSo this is not the application\non the computer,\n\n342\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.410\nit's not in the operating system.\n\n343\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.250\nThis is where the host that\nactually receives the information,\n\n344\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:11.930\nit is what breaks down all of the data\ninto the individual components as well.\n\n345\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.450\nOr into the individual\nsegmentation that needs to, and\n\n346\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.680\nputs it all back together is the host,\ntoo.\n\n347\n00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.650\nThen up here at layer five is\ngonna be that logical ports.\n\n348\n00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.410\nAnd we'll learn about the different\nlogical ports later on.\n\n349\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.850\nThere's 65,500 and-\n&gt;&gt; 35.\n\n350\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.198\n&gt;&gt; 35 of them.\n\n351\n00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:36.132\n[LAUGH] Logical Ports are right here.\n\n352\n00:21:36.132 --> 00:21:41.920\n[BLANK AUDIO] And then we don't\n\n353\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.710\nhave anything at the formatting layer,\nwhich I'm thankful for at this point.\n\n354\n00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.570\nAnd then at the end here, in terms of\ndevices, this is the user applications.\n\n355\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:57.020\nNow everything that I'm telling you\nhere is really about the OSI model and\n\n356\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.020\nhow they describe certain things.\n\n357\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.680\nWhen you and I get into the TCP/IP model\nyou'll see that they're a little bit\n\n358\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.630\ndifferent in the way that\nthey describe certain things.\n\n359\n00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.340\nAnd they don't even assign devices per se,\nbut\n\n360\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.270\nthey do talk about the different protocols\nand what ends up happening as well.\n\n361\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.270\nSo being able to take a look at this,\ndon't worry,\n\n362\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.240\nthey're actually inside the show notes.\n\n363\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.950\nThe function and\ndescription is a little bit different, but\n\n364\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.566\nyou'll be able to see that once\nyou actually get in there.\n\n365\n00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:29.940\nSo overall though, this is\nthe amount of information you need.\n\n366\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.350\nI know you're probably like,\nare you joking me for this exam?\n\n367\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.460\nNo, I'm not.\n\n368\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.060\nOkay, I wish I could tell\nyou it was fairly easy for\n\n369\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.780\nus to be able to do this but it isn't.\n\n370\n00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:46.660\nThere is just a lot of information,\nI would make sure I focus in on the layers\n\n371\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.220\nand then make sure you understand the\nbasic functionality at each layer here.\n\n372\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.000\nDon't worry about getting\nspecific wording,\n\n373\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.490\njust understand the basic functions.\n\n374\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.450\nPay attention to these protocols,\na couple of them each.\n\n375\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.231\nAnd then especially on layer\nfour through to one, down here,\n\n376\n00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:06.540\npay attention to the devices.\n\n377\n00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.550\nThey don't tend to do much up here\nin the layer five through seven.\n\n378\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.710\nBut at least layer four through one, make\nsure you pay attention to those devices.\n\n379\n00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.660\nAlways extremely important.\n\n380\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:24.600\nI know it seems weird, but relatively easy\npoints on the exam if you can do that.\n\n381\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.880\nKnow the layers,\nunderstand the basic functionality.\n\n382\n00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.450\nYou go, okay, I know that that's talking\nabout layer four or layer three, and\n\n383\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.740\nyou'll be fine.\n\n384\n00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.750\nAnd then the protocols,\nprobably the hardest one, remember,\n\n385\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.420\ncuz there's so many.\n\n386\n00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.900\nAnd then the devices from\nlayer four through layer one.\n\n387\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.620\nThose are gonna be key as\nyou get ready for the exam.\n\n388\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.260\nAll right, so, Wes, here it is.\n\n389\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.610\nIf you are trying to write and type,\nyour fingers are sore at this point, and\n\n390\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:54.290\nyou're probably like, I can't believe\nthis, this is Insane amount of stuff.\n\n391\n00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.537\nWell, now let's talk about how it works.\n\n392\n00:23:56.537 --> 00:24:01.581\nSo just learning this, this is kind\nof the mark review, mark memorize,\n\n393\n00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:06.138\nmark whatever you want to, and\nmake sure that you do that, okay?\n\n394\n00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.120\nNow, how does this work out?\n\n395\n00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.860\nWhere it actually works out, it begins in\nwhat we call the OSI encapsulation, okay?\n\n396\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.860\nNow, I'll explain what all this\nabout as we go through this.\n\n397\n00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.770\nBut let's talk about this right here,\nWes, just here for a moment, okay?\n\n398\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.810\nSo here it is, when we go back to this\nidea of the communication model, right?\n\n399\n00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:33.280\nExisting on that sending or\nthat source computer right now is data.\n\n400\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.110\nWe know that the data needs to be sent\nto a destination computer somewhere.\n\n401\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:43.330\nBut the data as it exists right now\nin its current form on that computer,\n\n402\n00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.550\nis not ready to be transmitted\nacross the network.\n\n403\n00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:52.034\nEven if the data exist on my computer,\nit doesn't mean that the data could\n\n404\n00:24:52.034 --> 00:24:56.290\nautomatically be over on your computer and\nit be understood either.\n\n405\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.620\nSo what has to happen, then, if we're\ngonna be using networking to be able to\n\n406\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.990\nsend the data from one computer to\nanother one, is that the OSI model\n\n407\n00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.820\nputs what we call headers\non the information, okay?\n\n408\n00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.700\nSo each one of these is\nan additional piece of information\n\n409\n00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:21.230\nthat is added to the data and for\nspecific reasons and purposes.\n\n410\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.350\nSo remember that in\nlayer 5 through layer 7,\n\n411\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:29.000\nthe data that is added in in terms\nof these headers that you see,\n\n412\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.530\nthis information is so that the receiving\ncomputer, the destination computer,\n\n413\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.590\nunderstands what it is\nthat they're looking at.\n\n414\n00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.530\nOkay, so that they receive it and\nthat they can process it.\n\n415\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.150\nSo that's what layer 5 through 7 does.\n\n416\n00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:50.420\nSo as we begin the process of saying we're\ngonna send this data outbound, okay?\n\n417\n00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:56.210\nWhat begins to happen here is, let's say,\nthat Wes wants to send an email, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.280\nWhen Wes decides to send an email,\nhe goes, okay,\n\n419\n00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.360\nI know exactly who I need\nto actually send this to.\n\n420\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.300\nI know some information.\n\n421\n00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.420\nHe fires up his email program.\n\n422\n00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.720\nThat is Wes interacting at\nthe application layer, okay?\n\n423\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:15.780\nAnd the application layer, once Wes types\nin that information into that application,\n\n424\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.880\nhe has now added on a layer seven\nheader onto his data, okay?\n\n425\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.759\nAnd that data itself now actually\nends up looking like this,\n\n426\n00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:28.130\nwhere you have that layer 7 header.\n\n427\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.025\nNow in the OSI model,\nwhen you have the header and\n\n428\n00:26:32.025 --> 00:26:34.980\nthe data itself, it is called a PDU.\n\n429\n00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.890\nNow, Wes,\ndo you know what a PDU stands for?\n\n430\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:39.849\n&gt;&gt; If I remember right,\n\n431\n00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:42.940\nI think that is a protocol data unit.\n&gt;&gt; Protocol data unit.\n\n432\n00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:48.200\nSo in OSI terms,\nit is called a protocol data unit.\n\n433\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.440\nAnd that means when they actually\nsay there's a layer 7 PDU,\n\n434\n00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.160\nthey're saying it's actually\nnot only the data itself.\n\n435\n00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.440\nBut also the application\nlayer header information\n\n436\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.260\nthat is going to be described in that.\n\n437\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.520\nNow, the way that the OSI model works,\nand all these model works,\n\n438\n00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.430\nis that the layer beneath services\nthe layer above it as well, okay?\n\n439\n00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:14.470\nSo now that we have this application with\nthe layer 7 header, we know something.\n\n440\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:19.500\nThat if I just put this out on network at\nthis point, there is no form this data,\n\n441\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.390\nthe other machine may not even recognize\nthis as data that needs to be recognized.\n\n442\n00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.640\nSo when it actually passes down and goes,\nthis needs to actually be recognized as\n\n443\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.090\nan email over on the other side,\nit says, all right, let's go ahead and\n\n444\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:39.630\nformat this as an email or something,\nany type of file that it wants to.\n\n445\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.590\nSo that the other side knows that,\nwhen it receives it, it's an email, okay?\n\n446\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.290\nSo this is where it says,\nhey, at layer 6 here,\n\n447\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.570\nit puts in a header that says,\nhey, I'm actually an email.\n\n448\n00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.810\nAlong with the application that\nwas used that as it was created\n\n449\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.680\non the sending side, it knows exactly what\napplication on the receiving side to use\n\n450\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.680\nbecause of layer 7.\n&gt;&gt; So it understands, from end to end\n\n451\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.130\ncommunications, I understand that syntax,\nI've got to know what the syntax is before\n\n452\n00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.820\nwe can really understand what's going on.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n453\n00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.750\nit has to actually be able to do that.\n\n454\n00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.350\nNow, once we have that,\nnow we have that format.\n\n455\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.270\nThe other thing that's also needed is that\nwe need to make sure that when it receives\n\n456\n00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.620\nit, it does a synchronization because I\nmight actually have to send more than one\n\n457\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:33.200\npiece of the pie,\nmore than one piece of that message to it.\n\n458\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.195\nSo it actually establishes\nsynchronization using the session layer.\n\n459\n00:28:37.195 --> 00:28:41.390\nSo when I first send it says,\nhey, this maybe sequence one, and\n\n460\n00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.440\nthere maybe more sequences to follow.\n\n461\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.880\nSo the session layer begins to put in\njust a little bit of information saying,\n\n462\n00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.780\nlet's go a head and\ndo our synchronization first.\n\n463\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.070\nI want to sync up with you and\nlet's go a head and begin to do that.\n\n464\n00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.270\nSo now notice that we're adding on\nmore and more of these headers.\n\n465\n00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.208\nAnd once we do,\n\n466\n00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:06.240\nthis now becomes layer 5 PDU which means\nit includes all this header information.\n\n467\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:12.170\nOnce it has all of that information and\nready for the other destination computer,\n\n468\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.890\nso this is all the information\nthat destination computer needs so\n\n469\n00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.500\nthat they can read what the data's\nultimately going to be, okay?\n\n470\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.350\nAnd now prepares it for the network.\n\n471\n00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.500\nThe transport layer takes a look at the\nsession layer here, and the information.\n\n472\n00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:32.030\nNow there's the L5 PDU and goes,\nhey, that's too big for the network.\n\n473\n00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:36.290\nIf that is too big for the network,\nthe transport layer says,\n\n474\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.420\nall right,\nhere's what's gonna have to happen, Wes.\n\n475\n00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.280\nI'm gonna need to divide you up\nin these chunks that will fit\n\n476\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.130\nonto our network, okay?\n\n477\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.930\nBut to ensure that it\ndoesn't get lost either,\n\n478\n00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.850\nwe're gonna put sequencing\ninformation on it.\n\n479\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.160\nThe other thing that we're gonna do\nis because of sequencing information,\n\n480\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.130\nwe're going to be able to establish\nerror recovery on the other end, too.\n\n481\n00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.420\nSo it adds in a ton of information because\nit knows it's going across network and\n\n482\n00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.160\nit doesn't wanna lose anything.\n\n483\n00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.440\nSo the transport layer can, optionally,\ngive us that benefit to do this.\n\n484\n00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.050\nNow once we do that,\nthat's called a layer 4 PDU.\n\n485\n00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.950\nNow the other term that I want\nyou to associate at this layer,\n\n486\n00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.120\nthough, is right here, okay?\n\n487\n00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.590\nWhich is the segment.\n\n488\n00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:21.250\nNow this particular term segment, it is\nall about that chunking of the data, okay?\n\n489\n00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.910\nBut that's what we also call it,\nwe call it a segment of data at\n\n490\n00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.880\nlayer 4 on the OSI model.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n491\n00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.310\nif your computer goes to put that\nbox out there on that network and\n\n492\n00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.140\nthat box is too big, it's going to say,\nwell, wait a second here,\n\n493\n00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.750\nI can't handle that box but what I can\nhandle is a lot of small individual boxes.\n\n494\n00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.280\nAnd then I'll go ahead and mark each\none of those boxes so that we know\n\n495\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.570\nwhat we should expect on the other end.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n496\n00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.170\nthere's plenty of stuff that\nwe're actually seeing it.\n\n497\n00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:52.230\nSo now I'm notice that at layer 4, as we\nmove from the data getting prepared for\n\n498\n00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.700\nthe receiving computer on the other end.\n\n499\n00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.520\nNow we're starting to prepare the data to\nbe put out on network, we now have exactly\n\n500\n00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.930\nwhat we need to make sure that it goes and\nthat it actually arrives properly here.\n\n501\n00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.710\nBut when you hear the term segment,\ntechnically, that's what we're\n\n502\n00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.000\nreferring to is layer 4 data.\n&gt;&gt; So we got all these boxes, Ronnie.\n\n503\n00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.180\nAnd we've got them numbered.\n\n504\n00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.990\nBut how do we tell where they're going?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n505\n00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.140\nthat's what we need to\nactually be able to do.\n\n506\n00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.400\nSo the rest of our process,\nin terms of what we call encapsulation.\n\n507\n00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.720\nAnd notice we're calling it encapsulation,\nbecause we continue to do what?\n\n508\n00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.240\nAdd in more and more layers at each of\nthese layers here, is what's happening.\n\n509\n00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.810\nNow, Wes, we still have these\nthree layers to go, and\n\n510\n00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.220\nwe haven't even talked\nabout the receiving side.\n\n511\n00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.860\nBut I'm also noticing that I have come\nup on the end of time for our segment.\n\n512\n00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.250\nSo it looks like that we need\nto hang on a little bit, and\n\n513\n00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.930\nwe'll discuss the rest of this.\n\n514\n00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.990\nAnd then pickup on how the receiving\ncomputer handles this information as well.\n\n515\n00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.510\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n516\n00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:51.170\nwe have that capability the way you're\nthoroughly just giving us the information\n\n517\n00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.870\nthat we need to know, a lot of moving\ncomponents when it comes to the OSI model.\n\n518\n00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.020\nI look forward to seeing part\nthree here because, well,\n\n519\n00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.580\nwe have a lot more to talk about.\n\n520\n00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.920\nRemember, this is the foundational\ninformation that is not gonna just benefit\n\n521\n00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.830\nyou on the exam.\n\n522\n00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.880\nBut like Ronnie and I have been talking\nabout in the beginning of this episode,\n\n523\n00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.870\nwe've been using it for\nyears now even though it is foundational.\n\n524\n00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.230\nSo it is crucial that you guys\nstick around for a part three.\n\n525\n00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.310\nRonnie, as always we do appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios and\n\n526\n00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.580\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n527\n00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.440\nKeep in mind, we've got a part three\ncoming up on the OSI model, but\n\n528\n00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.590\nyou're gonna have to stay tuned.\n\n529\n00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.990\nSigning out for\nITProTV I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n530\n00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n531\n00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.850\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n532\n00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.097\n[MUSIC]\n\n533\n00:32:30.097 --> 00:32:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:10.891\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.620\nHello to our TV viewers out there.\n\n5\n00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.940\nWelcome back to another great\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.660\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.230\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in the Cisco CCENT.\n\n8\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.950\nAnd that's right,\n\n9\n00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.600\nwe're coming back with the Open Systems\nInterconnection Model, the trilogy.\n\n10\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.290\nThat's right, and to help us up with\nour Part 3 there is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.370\nRonnie, how we doing, sir?\n&gt;&gt; We're doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.510\nThank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue our process in\n\n13\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.180\nunderstanding more about\nthe way that the OSI model\n\n14\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.140\nhelps us out in getting data delivered\nfrom the source to the destination.\n\n15\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.230\nSo in the last segment, we did pick up\non completing a table of information.\n\n16\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.910\nLet's take a look at this\nmonstrosity again here.\n\n17\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.880\nJust briefly, yes, we did actually\ntake a look at all that information.\n\n18\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.750\nWe talked about them briefly and your\ngoal as you prepare for your CCENT exam,\n\n19\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.190\nof course, is to, I hate to say it,\nmemorize more than anything else.\n\n20\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.591\nI'll put a link in there if I can remember\nin our show notes to the official\n\n21\n00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:12.320\nCisco one.\n\n22\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.220\nThis is kinda the Ronnie Wong version.\n\n23\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.970\nTake the official Cisco one, this is\nme trying to remember everything here,\n\n24\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.700\nis what we're seeing.\n\n25\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.290\nAnd we are in the process of taking\na look at the encapsulation model.\n\n26\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.450\nNow we had just gotten through\ntalking about the transport layer and\n\n27\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.120\nLayer 4 and the idea of the word segment.\n\n28\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.810\nAnd I described at the end of the previous\nepisode that you wanna make sure that you\n\n29\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.310\nassociate the term segment with\ntransport layer data, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550\nOr Layer 4 PDU.\n\n31\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.500\nIt is the same.\n\n32\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.800\nIt is equal at this point.\n\n33\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.610\nSo the idea of the PDU is\na very sophisticated way of,\n\n34\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.280\nanother way of saying segment,\nis what it actually comes out to be.\n\n35\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.680\nThe OSI model prefers this\nterminology right here.\n\n36\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.120\nIn reality,\nCisco uses the term segment as well.\n\n37\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.940\nSo you'll see both of them, but\n\n38\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.530\nyou need to make sure that you understand\nthat as we continue on, right?\n\n39\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.240\nSo now that we've gotten\na little bit of understanding,\n\n40\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.290\nright, that the transport layer will\nessentially break the data up, give us\n\n41\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450\nsome error recovery that we need to have,\ngive us some sequencing information.\n\n42\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.140\nWe understand that that\nmeans that now the data\n\n43\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.460\nhas to be able to get to its ultimate\ndestination, and Wes brought out.\n\n44\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.320\nSo now that we have it, what does it mean?\n\n45\n00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.610\nWell, now it means that all\nthose chunks of data, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.344\nWe need to put a dressing on each\none of those chunks of data, and\n\n47\n00:02:36.344 --> 00:02:39.171\nthat the network layer,\nthat's what it does.\n\n48\n00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:43.587\nSo whatever data,\nwhatever Layer 4 information that we have,\n\n49\n00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:49.145\nit now also applies to each chunk that was\nchopped up or to one chunk, the ultimate\n\n50\n00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:55.040\naddressing, in other words, of\nthe destination of where it's going to go.\n\n51\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.320\nSo this is where it will put in\nwhat we call the source IP and\n\n52\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.450\nthe destination IP,\nmeaning that this is where the data is\n\n53\n00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.530\nultimately going to end up\nusing this Layer 3 information.\n\n54\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.140\nAnd we'll describe this process a little\nbit better as we get into that on\n\n55\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.660\nthe other side when we see it on\nthe receiving side of the computer.\n\n56\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.810\nSo now, notice once again,\n\n57\n00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.210\nencapsulating all the Layer 4\nPDU inside of a Layer 3 header.\n\n58\n00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.320\nWe now get of course a Layer 3 PDU and\n\n59\n00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.500\nthe terminology has changed\nonce again to the term packet.\n\n60\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.060\nSo when you hear the term packet, there's\ntwo things that go on here, especially in\n\n61\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.280\nreading about it on the blogs, and\nhearing about people talk about it.\n\n62\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.820\nYou never know which one\npeople are going to mean.\n\n63\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.668\nThere is a generic term packet,\n\n64\n00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:43.686\nwhich means anything that's\nset across a network.\n\n65\n00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:47.477\nPeople use that term all the time and\nwhen you read about it in networking,\n\n66\n00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.923\nyou also hear people referring to packets,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:53.910\nwhat they mean is really data\nthat's just being sent across.\n\n68\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.570\nBut when it comes down to some of\nthe things that you'll have to deal with,\n\n69\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.050\nespecially for exam focus, though, okay?\n\n70\n00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.430\nPacket actually means that Layer 3 PDU.\n\n71\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.090\nI know there's some specific stuff,\nbut yeah,\n\n72\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.540\nthis is the term that,\nif you wanna go technical, right, Wes?\n\n73\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.510\nThis is the term that's been\nabused probably more often.\n\n74\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.450\nBecause when people use it, you don't know\nif they're referring to Layer 4 data, or\n\n75\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.990\nLayer 3 data, or Layer 2 data a lot of\ntimes, they're just packets being sent,\n\n76\n00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.160\nis what they're doing.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I use that,\n\n77\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.010\nI am as guilty as anybody\nsaying everything's a packet,\n\n78\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.580\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Who doesn't?\n\n79\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.120\n&gt;&gt; But like you said, specifically for\n\n80\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.670\nthe exam, you're gonna have to be aware of\nwhich layers these PDUs operate at, right?\n\n81\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n82\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.900\njust make sure that when it\ncomes down to your exam prep,\n\n83\n00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.850\nuse the term packet when you think that\nthere're referring to Layer 3 PDUs.\n\n84\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.730\nBut in generic terms, people will use it\nin any way, shape, form that they want to.\n\n85\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.340\nSo that's just a hint and\na warning to you.\n\n86\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.440\nLayer 2 is the most interesting one that\nwe have here, because now that we have\n\n87\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.692\nthe ultimate destination, in other words,\nwhere it's actually going to end up.\n\n88\n00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:05.300\nRemember that the data might\nactually reside on the same network,\n\n89\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.252\nit's very possible.\n\n90\n00:05:06.252 --> 00:05:11.910\nBut there's also a possibility that the\ndestination computer may reside somewhere\n\n91\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.300\nelse, on a different network, and you\nmay have to actually go across multiple\n\n92\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.242\ndifferent devices before you ever get\nto that network destination, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:27.900\nSo it's very possible that\nthat ends up happening.\n\n94\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.210\nAnd when something like that ends up\nhappening, okay, what does it mean?\n\n95\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.850\nIt means that not only do we know where\nit's ultimately going, we also need to\n\n96\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.180\nhave the information that allows us to\nput the data on its forwarding path.\n\n97\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.180\nIn other words, I may not know the whole\nthing, but I know how to get it started\n\n98\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.030\ntoward the destination and\nthe data link layer helps us out there.\n\n99\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.490\nIt adds in a Layer 2 addressing,\nokay, and this actually is\n\n100\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.310\nwhat we call the source MAC and\nthe destination MAC address,\n\n101\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.850\nthat is actually a device\naddress at this point, okay.\n\n102\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.470\nAnd this means that it can actually move\nto the next device where the Layer 2\n\n103\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.230\ninformation is going.\n\n104\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.390\nAnd then it can actually be forwarded\nto that device as well, and\n\n105\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.290\nthen move it along the path towards\nthat Layer 3 addressing that it sees.\n\n106\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.190\nNow the other thing that Layer 2 does,\nand you'll see it here at the end,\n\n107\n00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.250\nI marked it so\nthat we could see it very clearly here.\n\n108\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.010\nI have FCS.\n\n109\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.150\nNow, Wes,\ndoes that acronym mean anything to you?\n\n110\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.300\n&gt;&gt; It certainly does.\n\n111\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.190\nThat's frame check sequence.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.371\nThe frame check sequence\nis actually very important.\n\n113\n00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.790\nNow, Wes, what's the purpose\nof this frame check sequence?\n\n114\n00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.170\n&gt;&gt; I think it's an integrity check.\n\n115\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.280\nI need to make sure that the frame itself\nthere, when it's received by the switch,\n\n116\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.080\nthat it has maintained its integrity and\nit hasn't been, and\n\n117\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.550\nwhen I say compromised,\nI mean whether network transmissions or\n\n118\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.160\nsome malicious transmission.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.310\nThe whole goal behind the frame check\nsequence is to ensure that the data\n\n120\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.240\nthat's been moved along the path\nhasn't changed since it left, okay.\n\n121\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.912\nSo when a device receives this data, okay,\n\n122\n00:07:05.912 --> 00:07:10.100\nit's gonna actually do\na mathematical problem.\n\n123\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.656\nAnd what should end up happening is that\nthe answer to that mathematical problem\n\n124\n00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:18.040\nmatches what's also in\nthis frame check sequence.\n\n125\n00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.070\nBecause the very first time when we\nsend that data, it's gonna put in that\n\n126\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.120\naddressing information, then it's gonna\nrun through its entire thing here,\n\n127\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.060\nand also put in a check sequence.\n\n128\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.760\nIn other words, it's gonna run through and\ndo the same mathematical problem,\n\n129\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.490\nand then put the answer right\nhere in the frame check sequence.\n\n130\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.530\n&gt;&gt; And when it does that,\n\n131\n00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.900\nit will add it in here at the end,\nso that the receiving computer\n\n132\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.890\ncan do the same mathematical problem and\nget the same answer.\n\n133\n00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.890\nIf it doesn't get the same answer,\nthat means that somewhere along this path,\n\n134\n00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.100\nokay, the data is no longer the same\nas what was originally sent.\n\n135\n00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.227\nWhich means it needs to actually\nbe resent at some point too.\n\n136\n00:07:56.227 --> 00:07:59.711\nSo you name it, it actually has that\nability to check that too, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:03.248\nSo now here you have a Layer 2 PD or\nthe term is frame.\n\n138\n00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:08.911\nThe frame is essentially what gets put\nout onto the wire in terms of data, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:15.040\nSo that is the last real step in the\nencapsulation process, at least formally,\n\n140\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.537\nof saying, here's all the data that's\ngonna be put out onto the wire.\n\n141\n00:08:20.537 --> 00:08:24.421\nNow we're not done yet, because once we\nstart talking about putting it out on\n\n142\n00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:29.410\nthe wire, we don't just put a frame, which\nis a logical containment for you and me.\n\n143\n00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:35.610\nAll of that is actually transmitted as,\nwell, really, 1s and 0s, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.022\nBits of data is what it's\nactually transmitting.\n\n145\n00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:41.426\nNow I added in bits here,\nbecause it doesn't seem to make sense, but\n\n146\n00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:45.361\nwhen you actually see it on oscilloscopes\nand stuff, it just looks like waves,\n\n147\n00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:46.202\nis what it does.\n\n148\n00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:49.394\nBut when the receiving computer and\nthe sending computer send out,\n\n149\n00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.357\nit sends out as either an on or off, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:51.357 --> 00:08:54.503\nOr a 1 or a 0,\nif you were to actually see this, and\n\n151\n00:08:54.503 --> 00:08:57.300\nthat is what they generally count on,\nokay?\n\n152\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.172\nAnd now we take 1s and 0s, or\nelectrical signals, light signals,\n\n153\n00:09:02.172 --> 00:09:06.372\nwhatever you want to call it,\nradio frequency signal, and\n\n154\n00:09:06.372 --> 00:09:10.749\nwe put it out on to the media to\nthen be sent across the network.\n\n155\n00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:15.030\nOf course, then it actually needs\nto get to the destination computer.\n\n156\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.005\nNow, in that particular idea then,\nwe're not counting routing,\n\n157\n00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:22.785\nwhich we'll explain the process\nof routing a little bit later.\n\n158\n00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:27.544\nBut let's jump to the receiving side,\nand so now it's hit its ultimate\n\n159\n00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:31.847\ndestination at this point,\nat least it believes it has, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:31.847 --> 00:09:34.690\nSo now what will end up happening here?\n\n161\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.580\nWell, on the receiving computer side,\n\n162\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.751\nat the NIC itself,\nit will start sensing the signal okay?\n\n163\n00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:45.440\nThat can be voltage differentiation or\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n164\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.608\nIt starts to sense this, and\nonce it begins to take that data in,\n\n165\n00:09:50.608 --> 00:09:55.888\nthe data on the NIC, will start\nseeing that it's a frame of data.\n\n166\n00:09:55.888 --> 00:10:00.420\nIt will have of course, a frame header\nas well as a frame trailer here.\n\n167\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.911\nAnd when it does that, it takes a look\nat Layer 2 and the information here.\n\n168\n00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:08.634\nAnd it says hey,\nthe destination map address,\n\n169\n00:10:08.634 --> 00:10:12.170\nhere's what the destination\nMAC address is.\n\n170\n00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.256\nThe receiving computer takes\na look at it's own MAC address.\n\n171\n00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:19.560\nAt this point it says hey,\nthat's my MAC address.\n\n172\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.967\nSo it processes the layer two frame and\nit gets rid of the layer\n\n173\n00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:29.853\ntwo frame and\nit begins to also process at layer three.\n\n174\n00:10:29.853 --> 00:10:33.867\nOnce it goes to layer 3, now that\nhas processed the layer 2 header and\n\n175\n00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:37.898\nfooter, because it matched up and\nthe frame check sequence was good.\n\n176\n00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:41.397\nIt now also looks at\nthe receiving computer and\n\n177\n00:10:41.397 --> 00:10:45.975\nsays the destination IP address\non the packet of information\n\n178\n00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:50.340\nmatches my own IP address,\nthat means that what?\n\n179\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.920\nThis packet of information was\ndefinitely destined for me.\n\n180\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.800\nWhy, because it matched on the destination\nIP address on layer three, and\n\n181\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.510\nit also matched on it's\nown machine here too.\n\n182\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.318\nThen it continue to process on and\nas it does it,\n\n183\n00:11:06.318 --> 00:11:10.362\nnotice that what’s happening at each\nof these layers heer was right.\n\n184\n00:11:10.362 --> 00:11:15.230\nWe are removing the headers\nas we move up the stack.\n\n185\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.450\nNow, when we do that, that process\nis called decapsulation, okay.\n\n186\n00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.130\nAnd that is because each one is taking\na look at the header information.\n\n187\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.335\nSo now on that computer it's also taking\na look at the sequence information,\n\n188\n00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:31.538\nany error recovery\ninformation that it has to,\n\n189\n00:11:31.538 --> 00:11:35.380\nany type of other information\nthat needs that later for,\n\n190\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.888\nin terms of putting everything back\ntogether as far as sizes goes.\n\n191\n00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:44.022\nAnd it goes all right, so\nI know that I've received this pack,\n\n192\n00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:49.327\neverything is good, it processes layer 4,\nand then on that machine it says\n\n193\n00:11:49.327 --> 00:11:53.557\nI know exactly who this belongs to,\nand I know where it's from.\n\n194\n00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:55.879\nI know everything about\nthis particular packet and\n\n195\n00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:57.990\neverything else that it needs here.\n\n196\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.050\nSo it establishes that and\nit synchronizes and says,\n\n197\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.220\nall right, I know where this is actually\nfrom and everything's going to be good.\n\n198\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.063\nThen at the session layer,\n\n199\n00:12:07.063 --> 00:12:11.159\nit begins to once again process\nthrough the layer 5 header.\n\n200\n00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:15.443\nAt layer 6, it says,\nthis is this file type.\n\n201\n00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.860\nAnd does my machine\nrecognize that file type?\n\n202\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.260\nIt does, well,\nthen it processes the layer 6 header.\n\n203\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.380\nAnd then it knows exactly what\napplication to pass that up into.\n\n204\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.300\nAnd when it does that, that email program\non the other end, it opens it up and\n\n205\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.827\nit goes,\nthat's the email program that I need.\n\n206\n00:12:31.827 --> 00:12:34.110\nThere's the email program that opens up.\n\n207\n00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.221\nWes now actually clicks on that,\nand when he does that, or\n\n208\n00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:38.947\nwhoever it is on the other side.\n\n209\n00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:40.660\nI think I used Wes as the sending guy.\n\n210\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.837\nSo whoever it is on the other side there,\nokay?\n\n211\n00:12:42.837 --> 00:12:47.735\nThat Wes has sent that email to,\nnow opens up his email application and\n\n212\n00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:52.130\nhe can read and\nunderstand the data, itself okay?\n\n213\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.335\nAll this happens with data as\nit goes across the network okay?\n\n214\n00:12:56.335 --> 00:12:59.000\nSo, this is actually why it's important.\n\n215\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.373\nYou begin to see where things\ncan go wrong very easily right?\n\n216\n00:13:03.373 --> 00:13:08.840\nSo, for example, if it arrives on\nthe nick, itself, right here, right Wes?\n\n217\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.427\nAnd let's say that it says, look,\n\n218\n00:13:11.427 --> 00:13:15.239\nthe destination Mac address\nis not the same as mine.\n\n219\n00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.340\nWell, what does it do at that point?\n\n220\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.983\nThat's what we have to ask, right?\n\n221\n00:13:18.983 --> 00:13:22.881\nSo if it doesn't match at that\nparticular point in time,\n\n222\n00:13:22.881 --> 00:13:26.750\nit says that packet doesn't belong to me.\n\n223\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.797\nIf it doesn't belong tome I'm just gonna\nget rid of it cuz there's no need for\n\n224\n00:13:30.797 --> 00:13:34.797\nme to have a pack that I don't really,\ndoesn't really belong to me, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:36.614\nLet say it does match.\n\n226\n00:13:36.614 --> 00:13:41.910\nOkay that is actually one of the places\nalong the path to the destination.\n\n227\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.811\nIt matches on the Mac address so\nprocess layer 2.\n\n228\n00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:52.170\nBut then, it goes to layer 3,\nthe destination IP address though, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.478\nIt doesn't match\nthe destination over here.\n\n230\n00:13:55.478 --> 00:13:58.980\nAnd then it goes, wait a minute,\nit matched on the Mac address, but\n\n231\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.410\nI don't have an IP address for this.\n\n232\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.760\nSo I need to just go ahead and just put\nthis back out cuz I don't need it anymore.\n\n233\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.850\nSo in other words it says I'm\nrefusing this at this point in time.\n\n234\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.503\nSo it actually doesn't get past that.\n\n235\n00:14:13.503 --> 00:14:18.068\nAnd even if it gets past that, let's say\nthat it's a partial part of the data.\n\n236\n00:14:18.068 --> 00:14:19.860\nIt's missing some information.\n\n237\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.112\nLayer 4 checks it and goes,\nI'm missing sequence 300, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:25.112 --> 00:14:29.601\nI've got 100, 200, 400, but\nI'm missing sequence 300.\n\n239\n00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:33.860\nIt knows it can go, all right, so I need\nto resend a message and ask for what|?\n\n240\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.471\nSequence 300, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:38.130\nSo I can get the entire message back in.\n\n242\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.054\nSo anytime that we have that,\nthat's what can happen.\n\n243\n00:14:41.054 --> 00:14:45.410\nIf it can't synchronize, if the wrong\npresentation is not actually, and\n\n244\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.522\nit doesn't recognize\nthe actual format of the data,\n\n245\n00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:53.330\nthen it doesn't matter, cuz the end\nuser will never get the data itself.\n\n246\n00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.478\nSo you can see why the OSI model,\nin terms of its encapsulation and\n\n247\n00:14:57.478 --> 00:15:01.329\ndecapsulation of the messages\nis really an important part of\n\n248\n00:15:01.329 --> 00:15:03.917\neverything that we do.\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm glad you clarified\n\n249\n00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:04.570\nthat, Ronnie.\n\n250\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.607\nBecause maybe somebody out there is\nthinking it just goes from layer 7,\n\n251\n00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:12.988\nsending from layer 1 back up to layer\nseven when it comes to the receiving end.\n\n252\n00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:16.244\nSo what you're saying is in the process\nof getting that information across\n\n253\n00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:19.500\nthe various networks, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it's going to go\n\n254\n00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.880\nlayer 7 to 1 and then layer 1 to 7.\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n255\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.160\n&gt;&gt; We could see some,\n\n256\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.930\nhey we're going back and forth between\nthese layers before we ever make it back\n\n257\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.210\nup to layer 7 on that recipient end.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's one of\n\n258\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.800\nthose things that's a little bit hard\nto understand at the very beginning.\n\n259\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.112\nJust exactly what Wes said.\n\n260\n00:15:36.112 --> 00:15:40.244\nThere’s sometimes it's not going to make\nit all the way through and needs to get\n\n261\n00:15:40.244 --> 00:15:44.840\ndata resent and that is part of what the\nOSI model helps us to understand and do.\n\n262\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.786\nBut it actually is helpful because if you\ncan understand this part of the process,\n\n263\n00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:51.947\ntroubleshooting becomes easier.\n\n264\n00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:56.718\nUnderstanding where things break down and\non what devices that we have to check.\n\n265\n00:15:56.718 --> 00:15:58.262\n&gt;&gt; So if we know that, hey,\n\n266\n00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:03.047\nthe router's not forwarding it, okay,\nor whatever it might be or something\n\n267\n00:16:03.047 --> 00:16:07.628\nlike that, then we know that something\nis wrong somewhere down the line.\n\n268\n00:16:07.628 --> 00:16:11.118\nMore than likely, it means that this L3\npacket of the information was meant for\n\n269\n00:16:11.118 --> 00:16:14.260\nthe router, if it's not actually\ngetting past that router.\n\n270\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.570\nSo there is a lot of different\nways that this can come in handy.\n\n271\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.890\nBut for us,\nit is about troubleshooting, and\n\n272\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.200\na lot of times, depending on how you work.\n\n273\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.180\nI always like working from layer 1 all the\nway through layer 7, so I know that when\n\n274\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.770\nsomebody says, I'm not sure if I'm\ngetting basic data or connectivity.\n\n275\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.140\nI always check in the physical layer,\nis this working?\n\n276\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.310\nAnd that means,\nare the connectors actually good?\n\n277\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.610\nIs the cabling good?\n\n278\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.270\nDo I know that another device can\nactually do some of that, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.400\nThen you move up and verify that\nlayer 2 is working, then layer 3.\n\n280\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.960\nDo I have all of these things\nin the process of doing that?\n\n281\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.760\nBut for us, especially in Cisco, we really\ndo focus in on these first four layers.\n\n282\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.030\nIt's not that the last ones\nare not important, they are,\n\n283\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.490\ncuz that's ultimately what\nwe want to have happen.\n\n284\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.250\nBut since we're really focused in on\ndelivery itself, it really is these lower\n\n285\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:13.575\nthree or four layers that we tend to\nfocus in on in the realm of Cisco, okay?\n\n286\n00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:18.010\nSo it's one of those\nthings where if you go,\n\n287\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.540\nI can get by without doing this,\nyou're not, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.250\nIt's just not going to happen.\n\n289\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.346\nThe OSI model is that important,\nyou're not going to bypass this.\n\n290\n00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:30.270\nBut the issue though, Wes,\nwhere it comes down to this, right?\n\n291\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.993\nIs that we use this in teaching,\nwe use it as a reference all the time,\n\n292\n00:17:35.993 --> 00:17:40.480\nbut, Wes,\nit was never really implemented, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.960\nAnd so it was never really implemented,\nwhen we go back to this right here, right?\n\n294\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:54.710\nI told you that there is another model\nthat is out there, which is called TCP/IP,\n\n295\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:00.020\nwhich is a competing model\nthat we have out here.\n\n296\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.978\nAnd when we start to take a look at that,\nwe are gonna actually find out something\n\n297\n00:18:04.978 --> 00:18:09.566\nin the future a we jump into this one,\nis that you're actually gonna end up\n\n298\n00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:14.228\nseeing something that even though\nthe OSI model never really got popular,\n\n299\n00:18:14.228 --> 00:18:18.678\nthe TCP model did, it became very\nwidely adopted as a competing model.\n\n300\n00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:20.880\nBut even as a competing model,\n\n301\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.808\nit still uses the OSI model to really\ndescribe a lot of its processes.\n\n302\n00:18:25.808 --> 00:18:29.443\nSo we'll actually see another competing\nmodel here that we'll see that was\n\n303\n00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:30.647\nactually implemented.\n\n304\n00:18:30.647 --> 00:18:33.529\nAnd do that and then we'll of course\ncompare and contrast them, so\n\n305\n00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.875\nthat we understand why it's actually\nimportant that we know this.\n\n306\n00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:41.140\nBut this is a big chunk of data, a good\nchunk of data for you to spend time in\n\n307\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:47.040\nlearning and memorizing, because this will\nbe much easier points on the exam for you.\n\n308\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.015\nThat's some of the things we will be\ngoing over later on once we get more\n\n309\n00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:51.610\nCisco-specific.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n310\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.470\nyou had mentioned in the very\nfirst part of the OSI model here,\n\n311\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.430\nyou had mentioned some other certification\nexams that are out there, right?\n\n312\n00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.720\nI know I come over from\nthe CompTIA side of things and\n\n313\n00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.780\nthings tend to be very vendor-\n&gt;&gt; Neutral.\n\n314\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Or they attempt vendor neutrality and\n\n315\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.470\nwhen you have such a large corner of\nthe market to specific vendors, sometimes,\n\n316\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.630\nyou do get vendors specific.\n\n317\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.700\nBut would you say that,\ndefinitely for a CISCO exam,\n\n318\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.810\nthat we're steering away\nfrom that vendor neutrality?\n\n319\n00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.640\nAnd we really have to understand this\nfrom the Cisco's mindset because,\n\n320\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.260\nwhile there might be other people\nthat reference this model,\n\n321\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.010\nultimately at the end of the day\nwith a CCENT it's gonna be how\n\n322\n00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.530\nCisco references it.\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much the key\n\n323\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.860\nas far as understanding\nthe differences here.\n\n324\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.055\nThe great thing is if you already have\nthat knowledge such as the CompTIA\n\n325\n00:19:32.055 --> 00:19:36.230\nnetwork+ underneath your belt and you're\nready to go forward, it's nothing but\n\n326\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.370\nhelpful for you.\n\n327\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.440\nI guarantee that it has a big help and\nwhat you'll be facing here, too.\n\n328\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.970\nSo even if you're seeing a bit of\nredundancy on what you're learning here,\n\n329\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.190\nit is going to become more Cisco\nspecific as we move forward as well, but\n\n330\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.820\nit still means that\nfundamentals are important.\n\n331\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.880\nIf you don't learn this process here,\n\n332\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.620\nit's going to be much more difficult\nlater on as we get into other things.\n\n333\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.770\nEspecially in Cisco specific\ntypes of terminology,\n\n334\n00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.000\nthat's gonna be hard to describe if\nyou don't understand the OSI model.\n\n335\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.700\nSo take a look at it if\nyou actually need to.\n\n336\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.190\nMake sure you understand it as well and\n\n337\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.360\nreview this episode if\nyou need to as well.\n\n338\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.750\nThat will help out make sure that you\nhave a solid understanding before\n\n339\n00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.390\nyou to an exam.\n\n340\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.830\nAnd you will see it's a good chunk of what\nyou will learn, what you will actually\n\n341\n00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.052\nbe tested on the exam as well.\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom from Ronnie Wong.\n\n342\n00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:23.745\nNow Ronnie,\n\n343\n00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:27.589\nit does look like we are coming to\nthe end of a another great episode here.\n\n344\n00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:30.700\nAnd we have been talking\npretty specifically about OSI.\n\n345\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.660\nBefore we wrap it up,\n\n346\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.850\ndo you have any final words that\nmaybe you'd like to impart?\n\n347\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.190\nMaybe some new viewers,\n\n348\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.980\nmaybe this is the first time they're\ngoing into networking when it comes to\n\n349\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.510\nthat Open Systems Interconnection model.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just have to be willing to at\n\n350\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.640\nleast memorize it for\nthis point as much as anything.\n\n351\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.660\nI'd love to tell you that there's\na shortcut way to do this.\n\n352\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.110\nI do not know of any way.\n\n353\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:55.930\nSo, you make sure you memorize this OSI\nmodel and the layers that are there.\n\n354\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.090\nAnd take a look at the information\nthat's available to you.\n\n355\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.960\nAsk for help if you need to, especially in\ndifferent study groups that are out there.\n\n356\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.150\nCisco has a well-rounded community that\nreally is trying to help people learn and\n\n357\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.390\nget certified.\n\n358\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.890\nSo don't be hesitant to actually look\nin those places that are there too.\n\n359\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.770\nSo don't avail yourself of thinking that\nyou have to memorize this on your own.\n\n360\n00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.907\nThere are people that might have actually\nfigured out different ways to make it\n\n361\n00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:26.993\neasier for you to understand, to veer\nyourself of the community knowledge.\n\n362\n00:21:26.993 --> 00:21:27.852\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\n\n363\n00:21:27.852 --> 00:21:29.962\nalways great to have you\nhere in the studios with us.\n\n364\n00:21:29.962 --> 00:21:32.154\nAnd always great to have\nyou the viewer watching.\n\n365\n00:21:32.154 --> 00:21:35.481\nTake Ronnie's advice and make sure,\npractice, practice, practice, and\n\n366\n00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:36.460\nmemorize this stuff.\n\n367\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.175\nGet it under your belt.\n\n368\n00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:40.820\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out here for\nITProTV, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n369\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n370\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.719\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n371\n00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:49.772\n[MUSIC]\n\n372\n00:21:49.772 --> 00:21:53.187\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:28.580\nJoining us back in the studio,\nour good friend, Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.620\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n13\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.250\nHow's it

00:00:33.585\n&gt;&gt; Pleasure as always.\n\n17\n00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.910\n&gt;&gt; It's great to be back here\nbecause we get to start covering\n\n18\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.240\nthe realm of getting\ninto the land of Cisco.\n\n19\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.730\nAnd for me, Daniel,\n\n20\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.760\nthis is where I really think I found my\nhome in terms of the IT world, right?\n\n21\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.610\nI love the stuff that we're actually\ntalking about, and some of the different\n\n22\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.060\nthings that I've got to configure over\nmy experience here in the IT world.\n\n23\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.830\nCisco seems to be the one that I'm like,\nhey, I can do that.\n\n24\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.370\nAnd everything is actually fine.\n\n25\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.510\n&gt;&gt; Really latched on to that.\n\n26\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.040\n&gt;&gt; I think I have.\n\n27\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.830\nYeah, this is kind of my\narea where I'm comfortable.\n\n28\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.544\nI'm very comfortable in this area.\n\n29\n00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Your niche.\n\n30\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.997\n&gt;&gt; It is my niche.\n\n31\n00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:10.770\nBut I'm sure, there's tons of people\nout there who are much better.\n\n32\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.540\nBut at least today, it's our job.\n\n33\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.496\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe're the men playing today, what we do.\n\n34\n00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:19.446\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so what we are gonna\ntalk about today, okay, is, well,\n\n35\n00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:24.360\na competing model to the OSI model, okay,\nis what we're gonna be talking about.\n\n36\n00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.620\nSo yes, believe it or not.\n\n37\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.400\nRemember that if you've been watching\nthe shows in the same order that they're\n\n38\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.880\nappearing on our website here,\nwe've talked about the OSI model.\n\n39\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.800\nWe've shown you how it breaks down,\nthose different seven layers.\n\n40\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.500\n&gt;&gt; And we even talked a little\nbit about the history of it.\n\n41\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.290\nSo let's go back to my screen\nhere just for a moment.\n\n42\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.200\nAnd remember that what we're\nreally talking about here, right,\n\n43\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.580\nis that without this idea of the model,\neverybody was competing and talking.\n\n44\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.520\nAnd they pretty much all the different\nnetworking models out there spoke their\n\n45\n00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.800\nown language.\n\n46\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.076\nBut when the OSI came along from\nthat group called ISO, okay,\n\n47\n00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.976\nremember ISO doesn't actually stand for\nan acronym.\n\n48\n00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:05.170\nIt's a Greek word for equal.\n\n49\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.030\nAnd that meant that those countries that\nparticipated in the standardizing model,\n\n50\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.130\nthey came up with what they said,\nlook, guys,\n\n51\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.980\nyou don't need to actually develop\nyour own networking models,\n\n52\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.180\njust follow underneath ours and\nwe'll actually do a standardization.\n\n53\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840\nSo they came up with this idea,\none model to rule them all, okay.\n\n54\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.910\nOf course that when they started to do\nthat, some people did fall in line but\n\n55\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.640\nits descriptive nature in how it broke\ndown those seven layers in the networking\n\n56\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.300\nmodel that we looked at, we're not\ngonna review all of those things.\n\n57\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.760\nCuz you've already seen\na few episodes on that.\n\n58\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.020\nBut once I actually described\nthat it was so beneficial and so\n\n59\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.180\neasily referenced that\npeople could follow easily.\n\n60\n00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.230\nThat it's like, man, that's a great\nmodel but nobody really ended up\n\n61\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.730\nwidely adopting the actual networking\nmodel that they came up with.\n\n62\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.290\nPeople adopted the terminology,\nthey adopted the description.\n\n63\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.130\nThey adopted everything else.\n\n64\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.680\nBut nobody really bought into\ntheir networking model in terms of\n\n65\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.390\nimplementation.\n\n66\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.810\nNow during that time, when the OSI model\ndid, pretty much was out there, right?\n\n67\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.480\nThere was another competing\nstandardization, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.360\nAnd that was another group of people,\nor another groups of groups,\n\n69\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.220\nI guess is the easiest\nway to think about it.\n\n70\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.020\nWell, they didn't like everything\nthat there was about the OSI model.\n\n71\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.730\n&gt;&gt; Who does?\n\n72\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Who does?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who today really does?\n\n74\n00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.140\nThey didn't like that.\n\n75\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.060\nSo the Department of Defense,\nand contractors, and\n\n76\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.190\nuniversities, they said look,\nit doesn't have to be the OSI model.\n\n77\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.180\nLet's come up with our own\nstandardizing way to do things.\n\n78\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.750\nSo this essentially was a competing\nopen standardization type\n\n79\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.020\nof model that was also right\nthere at the same time.\n\n80\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.665\nSo it wasn't vendor specific.\n\n81\n00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:57.606\nTCP/IP isn't vendor specific, and that's\nthe model we're gonna be focusing on,\n\n82\n00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:00.136\njust like OSI wasn't supposed\nto be vendor specific.\n\n83\n00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:04.107\nBut instead they chose this idea of\nactually doing it their way instead\n\n84\n00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:09.020\nof the way that they wanted everybody\nelse to do it, which was the OSI model.\n\n85\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.185\nAnd when it came down to the very\nend of this, right, in the 70s and\n\n86\n00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:17.970\nthen as it became more popular in\nterms of networking, by the early 90s,\n\n87\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.120\nthe OSI model in terms of\nimplementation really dropped off.\n\n88\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.020\nSo did the majority of all\nthese vendor specific models.\n\n89\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.239\nThey kind of started dropping\noff except for one guy.\n\n90\n00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:31.157\nOne guy stuck around for\na long time, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:35.167\nIPX/SPX is stuck around for\nquite a bit of time, but\n\n92\n00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:38.367\nafter a while even they kind of went away.\n\n93\n00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:39.287\nCan you still find the model?\n\n94\n00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:42.658\nYes, you can still find systems\nthat are out there, but\n\n95\n00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:47.324\noverall today, if you want to talk\nabout networking, pretty much everybody\n\n96\n00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:51.957\nelse by de facto at this point because\nof their adoption, adopted TCP/IP.\n\n97\n00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:56.821\nAnd that is the model that we are going\nto be spending some time taking a look at\n\n98\n00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:58.493\nbecause it is the model and\n\n99\n00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:02.980\nessentially the language of\nthe Internet that we're talking about.\n\n100\n00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.583\nSo we need to learn a little bit\nmore about the TCP/IP model.\n\n101\n00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:10.899\nNow if you're looking at this\nfrom this standpoint and\n\n102\n00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:13.928\nwhere we've already gone\nthrough the OSI model,\n\n103\n00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:18.440\nyou're starting to see that it\nbreaks down almost in the same way.\n\n104\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.570\nNow it is different, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.250\nThe very fact is, remember that\nthe OSI model has seven layers.\n\n106\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.220\nWhereas what we see in\nthe original TCP/IP model,\n\n107\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.920\nthey broke it down into\nfour layers instead.\n\n108\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.990\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\nyou see this original model where you see\n\n109\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.750\napplication, transport,\nInternet, and network access.\n\n110\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.370\nNow notice I also put these\nterms over here to the side.\n\n111\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.480\nSo when we had mentioned it in the OSI\nmodel a little bit earlier, let me see if\n\n112\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.170\nI can find the one that I'm looking for,\nwhich is actually not that one.\n\n113\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.020\nThat's the one, okay.\n\n114\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.000\nI mentioned that there were some\nterms that you needed to associate\n\n115\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.738\nwith the layers here, right?\n\n116\n00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:02.600\nSo Layer 4,\nyou not only associate the Layer 4 PDU but\n\n117\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.120\nalso the term segment And\nthen at Layer 3 packet, frame, and\n\n118\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.170\nbits, the OSI model prefers this,\nPDU, protocol data unit.\n\n119\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.407\nThat is their terminology,\nthat's what they want you to call it.\n\n120\n00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:17.020\nThat's what they want to do it.\n\n121\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.250\nBut in reality, in TCP/IP, they actually\nrefer to them in this terminology instead.\n\n122\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.480\nSo this is TCP/IP terminology, but\n\n123\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.400\nalso gets integrated in within\nthe reference model of OSI as well.\n\n124\n00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.770\nSo that's where that terminology comes\nfrom, and yes, you do have to know both.\n\n125\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.870\nI wish I could tell you for the exam you\njust have to learn one or the other.\n\n126\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.340\nIt's not gonna be that way.\n\n127\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.800\nYou do need to know both these.\n\n128\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800\n&gt;&gt; That's really interesting.\n\n129\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.690\nI never actually knew that.\n\n130\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.430\nI've dabbled a bit in\nthe networking world.\n\n131\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.890\nI did not understand that\nPDU was OSI's terminology.\n\n132\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.170\nYou have a Layer 4 PDU and\nLayer 3, and it's always a PDU,\n\n133\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.050\njust what layer is it on.\n\n134\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.750\nWhereas the TCP/IP model says,\nwe're gonna give it an actual\n\n135\n00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.800\nsomething that changes, gives you more\nof a reference of, that's a segment.\n\n136\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.390\nThat's a packet,\nthat's a frame, those are bits.\n\n137\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.200\nI feel like I can latch on to that\na little more than I can a PDU.\n\n138\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's strange, and\nthere's a reason behind this,\n\n139\n00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:15.774\nokay, so\n&gt;&gt; The terminology that Daniel's\n\n140\n00:07:15.774 --> 00:07:20.132\ndescribing here where one is kind of\ngenericized, right, like Layer 4 PDU,\n\n141\n00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:20.939\nLayer 3 PDU.\n\n142\n00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.459\nIf you don't know anything about it\nyou don't know that it's really any\n\n143\n00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:24.211\ndifferent, right?\n\n144\n00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:27.748\n&gt;&gt; Frame of reference,\nunless you have the frame of reference.\n\n145\n00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:31.313\n&gt;&gt; But by separating out the term\nsegment and packet, frame here,\n\n146\n00:07:31.313 --> 00:07:34.877\nyou kind of get just by the name\nof what we're giving this thing,\n\n147\n00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:37.137\nthat this is something different here.\n\n148\n00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:40.600\nI mean, we explained the breakdown of\nwhat each of these actually means for us.\n\n149\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.312\nBut just remember that that's\nthe kind of difference here.\n\n150\n00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:45.434\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nokay, so Ronnie,\n\n151\n00:07:45.434 --> 00:07:46.990\nyou kind of have to ask that question.\n\n152\n00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.279\nWhat the heck is the difference?\n\n153\n00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.639\nAnd why does it matter, okay?\n\n154\n00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:55.003\nIt matters because of the way that\nthese two competing models were\n\n155\n00:07:55.003 --> 00:07:56.918\nreally originated, okay?\n\n156\n00:07:56.918 --> 00:07:59.400\nRemember that when you take\na look at the OSI model,\n\n157\n00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.400\nwhat they want to do Is that they said\nwe're gonna develop a networking standard.\n\n158\n00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.225\nSo Daniel, what they ended up\ndoing instead was say look,\n\n159\n00:08:06.225 --> 00:08:08.560\nhere's how we believe networking works.\n\n160\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.930\nSo they came up with a model,\nor a framework first and\n\n161\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.340\nthen they tried to actually describe the\nframework in each of those seven layers\n\n162\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.028\nand they came up with\nterminology to do that.\n\n163\n00:08:19.028 --> 00:08:24.658\nWell what TCP/IP did is say, look,\nwhat do we know is involved in networking?\n\n164\n00:08:24.658 --> 00:08:27.580\nAnd they founded protocols first and\n\n165\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.540\nthen they built the model based\noff the protocols that worked.\n\n166\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.500\nSo that's why you're actually seeing\na difference in the terminology.\n\n167\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.980\nOne is a generic, very referential\ntype of description, the OSI model,\n\n168\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.650\nwhereas TCP/IP model goes, on this layer\nwe already had these protocols at work and\n\n169\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.780\nwe’re just gonna call it\nsegments at this point.\n\n170\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.301\nHere’s what it is when it's\nactually at layer three.\n\n171\n00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:53.506\nWe’re going to call it this, and we’re\nactually going to see that that’s what\n\n172\n00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:57.273\nended up happening is that they ended\nup finding the protocols first and\n\n173\n00:08:57.273 --> 00:08:59.438\nthen they define the networking model.\n\n174\n00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:04.069\nSo one is top down, like the and\nif you think about TCP/IP model,\n\n175\n00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:08.102\nis from the bottom up, they look for\nthe little details first and\n\n176\n00:09:08.102 --> 00:09:11.140\nthen they define the model itself.\n\n177\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.538\nSo when you start to see this idea here,\n\n178\n00:09:13.538 --> 00:09:16.599\nyou do also need to memorize these layers,\nokay.\n\n179\n00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:20.890\nAnd also make sure you understand where\nthey line up to the OSI model as well and\n\n180\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:25.117\nwe'll take a look at a diagram a little\nbit later where I put all three of these\n\n181\n00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:29.570\nup beside each other so that you can\ntake a look and see this, right?\n\n182\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.310\nSo, here it is.\n\n183\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.290\nYou have Application, Transport,\nInternet, and Network Access.\n\n184\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.820\nNow this original model,\n\n185\n00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.860\nthis is the way that I learned, and\nI'm pretty sure it's the original way that\n\n186\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.960\nDaniel learned it back when we\nfirst started learning about it.\n\n187\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.980\nBut after a while and time, they found\nout something about some of these things.\n\n188\n00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.010\nSo like Network Access, it was so generic\nthat people would kind of misunderstand.\n\n189\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.000\nWell, what did that really include?\n\n190\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.270\nWhat does that actually mean,\nin Network Access?\n\n191\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.930\nSo instead you start to see where\nthey updated the model at some point,\n\n192\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.470\nwhich is over here on the right.\n\n193\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.990\nAnd instead of a four layer model\nthat you see which was the original,\n\n194\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.240\nyou now have it actually referred to\nmore often, especially in Cisco land,\n\n195\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.290\nin a five layer model instead.\n\n196\n00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.220\nYou'll see where they did take\nthis idea at the physical and\n\n197\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.070\nthe data link here, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.900\nAnd the reason why that's actually very\nimportant is because they realized that it\n\n199\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.645\nneeded to be much more descriptive\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n200\n00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:30.982\nBecause there was actually\nthe idea of whether or\n\n201\n00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:34.670\nnot they were using the proper\nterminology, it was so generic.\n\n202\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.450\nSo that's what you see.\n\n203\n00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.450\nApplication, Transport, Internet,\n\n204\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.560\nData Link, and\nthen the Physical layer here too.\n\n205\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.030\nSo all of this is actually very\nimportant when you start to see this.\n\n206\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:50.210\nSo remember that at this point, in terms\nof head to head competition, TCP/IP\n\n207\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:56.490\nis the one that did end up winning and\nalso when you hear people refer to it,\n\n208\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.400\nsometimes it's given that moniker of\nthe language of the Internet, okay.\n\n209\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.540\nThat's what it's also known as,\nor the protocol of the Internet.\n\n210\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.600\nThis is what the Internet traffic\nuses to ensure that it understands\n\n211\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.860\nhow data moves from one device to another\ndevice to get across the Internet\n\n212\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.050\nis using the idea of TCP/IP, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.550\nSo it is very important that\nwe start to take a look here.\n\n214\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.990\nSo when we start to take a look then,\nwe are now talking about\n\n215\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:29.020\nthe actual implementation of things and\nthis where is falls in.\n\n216\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.810\nNow strangely enough,\nthe OSI model is still used\n\n217\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:37.670\nin reference to the way that we describe\nthings moving across the Internet, but\n\n218\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.900\nin reality this is how it breaks down,\nokay?\n\n219\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.410\nSo what we want to see then is we've\nalready talked about of course the idea\n\n220\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.770\nof encapsulation of data.\n\n221\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.490\nAnd also decapsulation of data.\n\n222\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.700\nRemember that when\na computer is trying to put\n\n223\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.100\ndata onto the network to be delivered to\nthe destination, source to destination.\n\n224\n00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.560\nWe have to encapsulate the data,\nokay, in this fashion.\n\n225\n00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.490\nThen we put it on the wire, and\nit goes across to its destination and\n\n226\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.750\nthat the destination computer or\ndevice at the end.\n\n227\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:18.920\nIt decapsulates by processing each\none of the actual headers here and\n\n228\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.290\nthen it gets onto that,\ninternally onto the machine.\n\n229\n00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.580\nAnd from that point it's\nnot moving anymore.\n\n230\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.720\nThen it actually ends up\nbeing data once again.\n\n231\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.080\nThe same thing also applies in\nterms of TCP/IP as well, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.900\nSo when we start to take a look at\nit we're gonna kind of dive into it\n\n233\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.260\nmore from the perspective\nof TCP/IP in encapsulation.\n\n234\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.704\nRemember we generically talked\nabout this reference idea,\n\n235\n00:12:45.704 --> 00:12:50.361\nbut now Daniel what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna take the actual protocols, and\n\n236\n00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:53.890\ntalk about them because that's\nthe perspective of TCP/IP.\n\n237\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.145\nSo I didn't wanna just kinda\ndo the same thing though.\n\n238\n00:12:56.145 --> 00:12:58.640\nHere's encapsulation,\nyou kinda get this idea.\n\n239\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.960\nSo let's do this and kind of understand\nwhat we actually have too, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.790\nSo now when we start to take a look here,\nokay?\n\n241\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.330\nNow I have a web server, okay,\nrunning on this server over here.\n\n242\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.380\nOver on the right-hand side I have\nof course somebody running a web\n\n243\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.900\nbrowser that we have.\n\n244\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.770\nAnd this is where\nthe application layer functions.\n\n245\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.744\nOkay, it is really that interface between\nthe apps running on my computer and\n\n246\n00:13:22.744 --> 00:13:27.780\ngetting the network ready to actually\nbe able to do what it needs to.\n\n247\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.320\nSo at the very beginning, when we start\ntalking about the application layer, well,\n\n248\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.600\nwhat happens then is, on the web server\nitself, okay, there's a default webpage,\n\n249\n00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.660\nand I'm just gonna use default,\nbecause it's actually easier to do so.\n\n250\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.220\nAnd we'll take a look at that.\n\n251\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.810\nWell, remember that that webpage\nis sitting on, let's say,\n\n252\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.050\nDaniel's server over here, okay.\n\n253\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.880\nAnd it sits on Daniel's server.\n\n254\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.150\nIt is still not data that is\nready to go across the network or\n\n255\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.220\nacross the Internet for that site.\n\n256\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.800\nSo in that sense when Daniel's\nserver gets a request,\n\n257\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.020\nthe way that it works in TCP/IP is\nthat we have to use a protocol.\n\n258\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.260\nAnd right here on this top line\nthat you see that I'm showing you\n\n259\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.540\nis HTTP is the protocol that we\nuse at the application layer.\n\n260\n00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.330\nAnd it sends an http GET message,\n\n261\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.740\nwhich essentially a request\nof the web server, okay?\n\n262\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.730\nOnce the web server gets that\nrequest based on the protocol,\n\n263\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.460\nthat protocol is that application\nlayer that we're talking about.\n\n264\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.180\nSo the application listens and\n\n265\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.820\nsays the web browser that's\nrequesting says use HTTP.\n\n266\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.820\nSo now the application says\nI'll respond with HTTP.\n\n267\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.640\nThat's the web server.\n\n268\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.040\nSo it will actually send back\nan acknowledgement message or an okay, or\n\n269\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.320\na 200 is what it will send back.\n\n270\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.992\nAnd even the beginning pieces of\nthe index.htm here, or default webpage,\n\n271\n00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:53.821\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n272\n00:14:53.821 --> 00:14:54.892\n&gt;&gt; It's a face-down payment, right?\n\n273\n00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:55.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n274\n00:14:55.678 --> 00:14:57.978\nActually, that's exactly what it is.\n\n275\n00:14:57.978 --> 00:15:01.150\nSo it starts to go, all right,\nI got your message.\n\n276\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.100\nI acknowledge that.\n\n277\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.090\nSo let me start to transmit this idea,\nokay?\n\n278\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.260\nSo it begins transmitting.\n\n279\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.628\nAnd once that starts happening\non the other side it says okay,\n\n280\n00:15:09.628 --> 00:15:10.760\neverything's good.\n\n281\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.110\nIt goes ahead and starts\ntransmitting the rest of that, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.190\nNow that doesn't all happen just\nat the application layer, but\n\n283\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.030\nit is the beginning process.\n\n284\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.060\nThe application layer,\n\n285\n00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.600\nthough, is what handles this\nexchange right here that you see.\n\n286\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.460\nSo it's very important\nthat we understand that.\n\n287\n00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.210\nSo as we are now starting to move down\nthrough the application layer, we'll start\n\n288\n00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:38.130\nto see that the next layer down from\nthat is the transport layer, okay.\n\n289\n00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.170\nNow the transport layer\nin the TCP/IP model\n\n290\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.500\ndoes a ton of different things, okay.\n\n291\n00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.682\nDon't get me wrong the application\nlayer does stuff too.\n\n292\n00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:49.900\nBut overall though,\n\n293\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.368\nokay, when we start to actually take\na look at what the transport layer can do,\n\n294\n00:15:54.368 --> 00:15:59.460\nits main function is right here what I\nhave underneath where it says transport.\n\n295\n00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.559\nIt provides a service to\nthe application there.\n\n296\n00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:06.410\nNow it doesn't matter what the service is,\nbut there's plenty of them.\n\n297\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.220\nOne of them, if you remember that what\nwe described here in the way that layer\n\n298\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.292\nfour data is described, right,\nis that we called it segments.\n\n299\n00:16:15.292 --> 00:16:20.180\nOkay, segmentation of the data\nessentially means break up the data\n\n300\n00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.367\ninto chunks that will\nfit into our network.\n\n301\n00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:26.457\nOkay, so\nyou may have data that's gigantic, and\n\n302\n00:16:26.457 --> 00:16:30.230\nit doesn't actually fit\nneatly onto the network.\n\n303\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.025\nSo instead, what the transport layer\ncan do is segment, in other words,\n\n304\n00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:36.675\nchop it up into manageable\nblocks that it needs to.\n\n305\n00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:39.730\nThe other thing that the transport\nlayer then can do is,\n\n306\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.085\nonce it chops it up into blocks, there has\nto be a way that if we start sending it,\n\n307\n00:16:44.085 --> 00:16:47.400\nwhat if one of those packets\ngets lost along the way?\n\n308\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.520\nWell, how do we recover from that?\n\n309\n00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.700\nSo the other thing that it can\ndo is what I have right here,\n\n310\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.360\nwhich is called error recovery as well.\n\n311\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.030\nIt can do things like error recovery,\nit can do segmentation,\n\n312\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.630\nit can do a bunch of other things too.\n\n313\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.358\nBut it's right here that\nwe want to focus in on.\n\n314\n00:17:02.358 --> 00:17:05.866\nI just said any service,\nso it doesn't matter, but\n\n315\n00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:09.110\nit can optionally do the error recovery.\n\n316\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.504\nAnd that is because at\nthe transport layer,\n\n317\n00:17:11.504 --> 00:17:14.817\nthere's two main protocols that\ncan actually be used here.\n\n318\n00:17:14.817 --> 00:17:19.581\nAnd one is called TCP,\nthat's the transmission control protocol,\n\n319\n00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.811\nand the other one is called UDP.\n\n320\n00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:26.825\nIf you use TCP,\nwhich we're gonna talk about in a later\n\n321\n00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:31.854\nepisode here, use TCP,\nerror recovery is expected.\n\n322\n00:17:31.854 --> 00:17:36.340\nOkay, and it's also going to provide for\na guaranteed data delivery as well.\n\n323\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.540\nCuz it synchronizes up at the application\nlayer to the other machine too,\n\n324\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.360\nso you start seeing a bunch\nof different things here.\n\n325\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.099\nOkay, so what happens,\nlet's just take a look\n\n326\n00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:49.596\nat error recovery as one of\nthe options here for the service.\n\n327\n00:17:49.596 --> 00:17:53.928\nSo now Daniel, as we are in\ncommunication between the web server and\n\n328\n00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:58.716\nthe web browser, okay, remember that\nwe said that it starts to send across\n\n329\n00:17:58.716 --> 00:18:01.002\njust a part of the default web page.\n\n330\n00:18:01.002 --> 00:18:05.913\nRight, so let's say that the very first\nthing that actually gets sent from the web\n\n331\n00:18:05.913 --> 00:18:09.843\nserver, it begins and\nattaches a sequence number of one with it.\n\n332\n00:18:09.843 --> 00:18:13.570\nAnd the side receives it, which is\nperfectly fine, and so that's great.\n\n333\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.863\nBut what if along the path,\nthough, somewhere along the way,\n\n334\n00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:20.980\nIt says, hey, sequence number two,\nI'm sending it with this okay message.\n\n335\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.238\nBut it doesn't ever get\nto the web browser, and\n\n336\n00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:28.077\nthen this guy, the web server,\njust says, all right.\n\n337\n00:18:28.077 --> 00:18:30.970\nWell, I don't know if I got any message or\nnot at this point.\n\n338\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.229\nLet me go ahead and send sequence\nnumber three, and it gets there.\n\n339\n00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:40.026\nWell, the web browser can look back,\nin terms of taking a look here,\n\n340\n00:18:40.026 --> 00:18:43.650\nno, I received one, and I received three.\n\n341\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:48.529\nSo before I move on to get four, let me\ngo ahead and send back a message saying,\n\n342\n00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:51.022\nI need to actually get number two back.\n\n343\n00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:55.820\nOkay, so I need that sequence of number\ntwo, please resend that one for me.\n\n344\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.840\nThat's why we call it error recovery,\nthis error occurred here.\n\n345\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.089\nOkay, and now we have a way where\nthe web browser can actually start and\n\n346\n00:19:04.089 --> 00:19:08.640\nsay, here's what I'm missing,\nplease send that data back to me as well.\n\n347\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.480\nAnd that is just one of those ways\nthat we can also use the transport\n\n348\n00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.177\nlayer to essentially help\nus to do what we need to.\n\n349\n00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:22.250\nOkay, so it's very important that we\nstart to see something like that as well.\n\n350\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.530\nSo the transport layer is very helpful and\nthere's other things that it can do,\n\n351\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.580\nbut that's a good example\nof what we also want.\n\n352\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.110\nNow let's go ahead and continue to\nmove through the transport layer.\n\n353\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.840\nNow that we understand that each of\nthe layers is actually providing a service\n\n354\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.580\nto that layer above it.\n\n355\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.315\nAnd this is true not only\nin the TCP/IP model, but\n\n356\n00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:44.259\nI'm pretty sure I forgot to\nsay this in the OSI model.\n\n357\n00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:46.106\nIt's the same thing in the OSI model,\n\n358\n00:19:46.106 --> 00:19:49.060\nthat it's providing a service\nto the layer above it as well.\n\n359\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:54.378\nOkay, so now let's move down through and\nwe'll actually take a look then at\n\n360\n00:19:54.378 --> 00:19:57.920\nthe third layer, okay,\nwhich is gonna be the Internet layer.\n\n361\n00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:05.270\nNow the Internet layer by itself is really\nall about addressing the packets here.\n\n362\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:11.148\nNow unlike what we talked about in the OSI\nmodel where we referred to layer three,\n\n363\n00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:15.482\nright, the layer three PDU as\nbeing the addressing layer.\n\n364\n00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:17.978\nOkay, when it comes down to TCP/IP,\n\n365\n00:20:17.978 --> 00:20:21.180\nthere's really only one\naddressing protocol.\n\n366\n00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.840\nAnd remember, that's important,\nbecause TCP/IP is based on what?\n\n367\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.477\nIt says we found the protocol first,\nwe don't care what\n\n368\n00:20:29.477 --> 00:20:34.619\nthe reference model is,\nwe're saying that this has to be IP.\n\n369\n00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.322\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz that's what it's\nbasing everything off of.\n\n370\n00:20:36.322 --> 00:20:39.869\nThis is our de facto standard, everything\nelse is just whatever we say it is.\n\n371\n00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:42.896\n&gt;&gt; Right, so unlike the OSI model,\nsays use IPX,\n\n372\n00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:45.655\nuse SMA, use all these other things here.\n\n373\n00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:47.660\nTCP/IP says no,\n\n374\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.930\nif you're gonna route, you're gonna\nuse IP, that's pretty much it.\n\n375\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:57.850\nSo it's here, and this is what IP helps\nus to do in reality across networks.\n\n376\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.240\nIt really does provide routing,\n\n377\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.040\nokay, and that is really\nessentially what it does for us.\n\n378\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.520\nRemember that putting an IP address on\nan envelope, it's the same as me putting\n\n379\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.450\nDaniel's address right on\nthe envelope to be sent to him, but\n\n380\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.770\nit doesn't move the data, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.543\nYou can look and go, that's supposed to\ngo to Daniel, and then you put it down.\n\n382\n00:21:15.543 --> 00:21:19.230\n[LAUGH] That envelope's not\ngonna walk over to Daniel.\n\n383\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.407\n&gt;&gt; It is needs the transportation system,\nwhich is the US Mail,\n\n384\n00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:23.820\nit's not going anywhere.\n\n385\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.953\n&gt;&gt; It's not going anywhere, so\nthe addressing itself, it's providing,\n\n386\n00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:31.640\nsaying here's where it's\nultimately supposed to go.\n\n387\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.500\nSo here I've got an example of routing,\n\n388\n00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.540\nthe web server can be on\nthe one side of this router.\n\n389\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.430\nAnd there can be multiple routers\nin between on my network here\n\n390\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.200\nuntil it gets to the web browser.\n\n391\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:48.220\nWell, whatever the IP address is on that\nparticular envelope or data that we have.\n\n392\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.350\nThat should help it go\nalong each one of these\n\n393\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.230\nto find the best path\nover to its destination.\n\n394\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.220\nThis is where routing is provided for\nthe segments of data that we have.\n\n395\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.170\nIt's not moving the data itself, but\n\n396\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.105\nit is actually saying,\nhere's where it's ultimately going to go.\n\n397\n00:22:05.105 --> 00:22:08.020\nSo the Internet layer is very important,\n\n398\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.361\nyou'll see that the entire\nprotocol really rests upon what?\n\n399\n00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:17.091\nLayers three and four, right,\nTCP is layer three here.\n\n400\n00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:19.895\nI'm doing the OSI model, sorry,\nlet's go backwards here, okay.\n\n401\n00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:24.601\nSo it's actually kind of the second and\nthird layer in the TCP/IP model.\n\n402\n00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:26.582\nSee, that's what happens,\nthe layers kinda get a little bit-\n\n403\n00:22:26.582 --> 00:22:27.324\n&gt;&gt; You get jumbled up in your brain, yeah.\n\n404\n00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:30.953\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so internet layer,\nTCP is that transport layer, and\n\n405\n00:22:30.953 --> 00:22:34.230\nthat's why you have\nthe entire protocol suite.\n\n406\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.580\nSometimes you hear\nthe term protocol stack,\n\n407\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.590\nit's actually referred to based off\nof these two layers here, okay?\n\n408\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.925\nSo those are the ones\nthat are pretty much set.\n\n409\n00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:48.363\nAll right, so now that we have that\nunderstanding, right, this is,\n\n410\n00:22:48.363 --> 00:22:52.142\nat this point here where once\nyou get to the Internet layer.\n\n411\n00:22:52.142 --> 00:22:56.270\nAnd then you go down to the network\naccess layer, which I did not draw here.\n\n412\n00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.670\nThe reason why is that, that's when you\ngo ahead and you start to move that.\n\n413\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.880\nNow, I thought I actually had here,\n\n414\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.470\nthere it is,\nI just moved it in the wrong place, okay?\n\n415\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.690\nSo now let's change it up here, so\nthat we can see this a little bit better.\n\n416\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.107\nI was starting to panic because I was\nlike, I know I took some time, and Daniel,\n\n417\n00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:12.647\nyou can tell why I'd get in a panic.\n\n418\n00:23:12.647 --> 00:23:15.653\nCuz if I had to redo this again\nin ten minutes, I couldn't do it.\n\n419\n00:23:15.653 --> 00:23:20.991\nOkay, so I kinda went,\nI thought I had it, but here it is.\n\n420\n00:23:20.991 --> 00:23:26.820\nOkay, so now at the network access layer,\nwhat does this do?\n\n421\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.881\nRemember, remind yourself that at each\none of these layers up here, right,\n\n422\n00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:35.192\nif we're moving the data across, now\nwe're gonna have segments, packets, and\n\n423\n00:23:35.192 --> 00:23:36.272\nnow we have frames.\n\n424\n00:23:36.272 --> 00:23:39.325\nOkay, the network access\nforwards frames and\n\n425\n00:23:39.325 --> 00:23:42.540\nbits towards the destination\nacross the media.\n\n426\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.950\nNow, that says medial,\n\n427\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.890\nbut that should be media,\nis what it does, that's my fault here.\n\n428\n00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.890\nSo then when you start to take\na look here, what do I mean by that?\n\n429\n00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:58.598\nWell, what is that moves the data along\nthe path to its destination of what's in\n\n430\n00:23:58.598 --> 00:23:59.593\nthe IP address?\n\n431\n00:23:59.593 --> 00:24:01.884\nNow I Did this.\n\n432\n00:24:01.884 --> 00:24:08.450\nI took one of the little drawings that's\nactually inside of my utility here, right?\n\n433\n00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.209\nAnd what we have is this.\n\n434\n00:24:10.209 --> 00:24:15.616\nEssentially, the network access layer\nreally functions as this truck.\n\n435\n00:24:15.616 --> 00:24:16.810\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n436\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.700\nIt's the delivery truck.\n\n437\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n438\n00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:20.554\nit is essentially a delivery truck.\n\n439\n00:24:20.554 --> 00:24:23.793\nThe protocols at this layer, ethernet,\n\n440\n00:24:23.793 --> 00:24:27.502\nit is the method of delivery that we use,\nokay?\n\n441\n00:24:27.502 --> 00:24:33.490\nNow who is it that's driving it along\nwhich of these two pathways to take?\n\n442\n00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:38.050\nWhat drives that along is our Layer\n2 address, which we in TCP/IP LAN,\n\n443\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.340\nwe call the MAC address.\n\n444\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.760\nSo in the OSI model, you could have MAC,\nyou could have frame relay,\n\n445\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.070\nyou could have ATM, you could have so\nmany different protocols.\n\n446\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.400\nTCPIP?\n\n447\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.838\nMAC address, that's it.\n\n448\n00:24:50.838 --> 00:24:51.416\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n449\n00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:52.834\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it, MAC address.\n\n450\n00:24:52.834 --> 00:24:58.010\nSo the MAC address is twhat says,\nwhere am I going next?\n\n451\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.343\nSo the MAC address works as the driver,\nthe guide.\n\n452\n00:25:01.343 --> 00:25:04.564\nWhere is the destination\nMAC address taking me next?\n\n453\n00:25:04.564 --> 00:25:09.069\nAnd once it does that,\nit then can bring the packet\n\n454\n00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:14.870\nforwarding it towards its\ndestination right over here.\n\n455\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.562\nSo this is where, like we said,\non the network access layer,\n\n456\n00:25:18.562 --> 00:25:22.267\nit functions as this truck,\nwhich then puts it onto the road.\n\n457\n00:25:22.267 --> 00:25:26.021\nAnd the media that we use,\nwhether it's wireless,\n\n458\n00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:30.712\nwhether it's wired, cable, or\ncopper, whatever it might be,\n\n459\n00:25:30.712 --> 00:25:34.317\nit essentially is our data\npathways that we have.\n\n460\n00:25:34.317 --> 00:25:38.350\nAnd then we get this data to\nits ultimate destination.\n\n461\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.233\nSo in TCP/IP, that's essentially\nwhat ends up happening for us.\n\n462\n00:25:42.233 --> 00:25:45.350\nSo it does it in four layers today and\nfive layers overall.\n\n463\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.336\nBecause they broke out the difference\nbetween the media and,\n\n464\n00:25:48.336 --> 00:25:51.450\nof course something like our\nLayer 2 addressing that they did.\n\n465\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.652\nBut you do see where this kind of comes\nout for us in what we actually need here.\n\n466\n00:25:56.652 --> 00:25:59.927\nSo it's essential that we\nunderstand those differences.\n\n467\n00:25:59.927 --> 00:26:03.821\nNow when you take a look at\nit compared to the OSI model,\n\n468\n00:26:03.821 --> 00:26:06.031\nit does the same thing, okay?\n\n469\n00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.459\nThe OSI model, though,\n\n470\n00:26:07.459 --> 00:26:11.001\nis more concerned that you\nunderstand the end to end process.\n\n471\n00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:14.616\nThe encapsulation and\nthe decapsulation of everything.\n\n472\n00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:18.193\nThe TCP/IP model is really\nmore about the idea,\n\n473\n00:26:18.193 --> 00:26:22.100\nhow do I get it from one place to another,\nokay?\n\n474\n00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.310\nSo it's not that it doesn't\ndo applications, it doesn't.\n\n475\n00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.500\nSo the equivalent that we tend to see,\nlet me make sure I can get this.\n\n476\n00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.880\nWhere did I put that?\n\n477\n00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.832\nThere we go.\n\n478\n00:26:32.832 --> 00:26:34.584\nIs right here.\n\n479\n00:26:34.584 --> 00:26:37.124\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this full screen, so\n\n480\n00:26:37.124 --> 00:26:39.190\nthat we understand what we have here,\nokay?\n\n481\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.936\nWhen you line this up and\nyou try to compare and contrast them,\n\n482\n00:26:42.936 --> 00:26:45.395\nmake sure that you can understand this.\n\n483\n00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:49.041\nI wish I could tell you don't worry about\nthe difference between the original and\n\n484\n00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:49.694\nthe updated.\n\n485\n00:26:49.694 --> 00:26:51.960\nI think you're gonna see it on the exam.\n\n486\n00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.080\nYou gotta know them both.\n\n487\n00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.260\nHopefully, it's not too much of\na difference that you have to worry about.\n\n488\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.150\nBut make sure you can do this and\n\n489\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.838\nline these things up,\nbecause it really matters.\n\n490\n00:27:00.838 --> 00:27:07.760\nBut for example, from layer five, all the\nway through layer seven of the OSI Model,\n\n491\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.827\nmake sure you can distinguish to\nthat's equal to the application layer.\n\n492\n00:27:13.827 --> 00:27:18.461\nAnd then of course,\nyou also wanna distinguish and\n\n493\n00:27:18.461 --> 00:27:23.202\nmake sure that you actually\nknow where they line up at\n\n494\n00:27:23.202 --> 00:27:27.537\nlayer 3 on the OSI Model,\nand layer 4 as well.\n\n495\n00:27:27.537 --> 00:27:31.798\nThese are kinda the big ones that you\nwanna make sure that you can match up if\n\n496\n00:27:31.798 --> 00:27:33.110\nyou need to.\n\n497\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.900\nOr what is the equivalent\nin each one of those, okay?\n\n498\n00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.090\nSo those are gonna be key things that\nare gonna help you when you get ready for\n\n499\n00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.610\nthe actual exam as you start facing that,\nokay?\n\n500\n00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.290\nNow we've already talked about\nsome of the differences as well.\n\n501\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.900\nSo now that we have a comparison,\nand you've seen that,\n\n502\n00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.590\nright, it does encapsulation.\n\n503\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.620\nIt does decapsulation just\nlike we talked about.\n\n504\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.430\nThe OSI Model does the same thing.\n\n505\n00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.180\nIt's different in the fact that OSI\nhas seven layers versus the four or\n\n506\n00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.510\nfive that we have.\n\n507\n00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.200\nAnd then, in reality, right, it's because\nit comes from that different perspective.\n\n508\n00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.585\nOSI Model said,\nwe're developing a reference model and\n\n509\n00:28:08.585 --> 00:28:11.275\nthen we'll add in\nprotocols as we need them.\n\n510\n00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:14.736\nTCP said, let's find the protocols first.\n\n511\n00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:17.037\nLet's find the protocols\nthat we wanna use and\n\n512\n00:28:17.037 --> 00:28:20.282\nthen we'll develop a networking\nmodel around those protocols.\n\n513\n00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:24.054\nSo that's really kinda the difference, and\nthat's why you see the difference here.\n\n514\n00:28:24.054 --> 00:28:27.478\nBut in reality, though,\nthey do the same functionality, okay?\n\n515\n00:28:27.478 --> 00:28:30.247\nSo today, even though we're using TCP/IP,\n\n516\n00:28:30.247 --> 00:28:32.980\nwe still use the the OSI Model\nto refer that.\n\n517\n00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.730\nAnd that's one of the trickiest things\nwhen I first started learning, why\n\n518\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:40.640\nthe heck are we using a reference model\nwhen TCP has its own model to follow?\n\n519\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.907\nIt's because it's easier to describe\nthe end to end process, and\n\n520\n00:28:43.907 --> 00:28:47.250\njust about everybody has been\ndoing that now for 30, 40 years.\n\n521\n00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.090\nSo you're not gonna get away from it.\n\n522\n00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.900\nThat's what it comes down to, and you'll\nneed to know this for the exam as well.\n\n523\n00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.890\nNow as far as I know, I'm trying to think.\n\n524\n00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.980\nJust make sure that you also\nunderstand the OSI Model.\n\n525\n00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:05.010\nIt doesn't tell you what every single\nprotocol is going to be, right?\n\n526\n00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.850\nIt just says, you pick a Layer\n4 protocol that you wanna use.\n\n527\n00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.078\nYou pick a Layer 3 protocol\nthat you choose to use.\n\n528\n00:29:11.078 --> 00:29:15.030\nWhereas in TCP/IP,\nyou're told what the protocols are,\n\n529\n00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:20.410\nespecially at layer 3 and layer 4 here,\nas we start to see that as well, okay?\n\n530\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.456\nSo Daniel, when it comes down to that,\n\n531\n00:29:22.456 --> 00:29:26.813\nwe didn't spend as much time as we did on\nthe OSI model, breaking everything down.\n\n532\n00:29:26.813 --> 00:29:32.042\nBut hopefully, we did show you, using\nthe actual protocols that are in place,\n\n533\n00:29:32.042 --> 00:29:34.553\nexactly how the TCP/IP model works.\n\n534\n00:29:34.553 --> 00:29:38.110\nWhereas when we actually did it for\nthe OSI Model in previous episodes,\n\n535\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.847\nwe really did talk about\nthe generically as possible.\n\n536\n00:29:40.847 --> 00:29:42.865\nAnd that's because that's\nwhat it's designed to do.\n\n537\n00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:47.513\nSo that should give you a pretty decent\nunderstanding of these two different\n\n538\n00:29:47.513 --> 00:29:48.101\nmodels.\n\n539\n00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.761\nAnd it means that there's a lot more for\n\n540\n00:29:49.761 --> 00:29:53.530\nus to learn because we're just starting\nto scratch the surface of networking.\n\n541\n00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.760\nBut Daniel, I think that's actually a good\nplace for us to have this episode end too.\n\n542\n00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n543\n00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.842\nWell, I totally agree with you there.\n\n544\n00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:01.660\nThis is good foundational knowledge,\n\n545\n00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.030\nstuff that we're gonna build upon\nas we get through the series.\n\n546\n00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.610\nSo don't think this is\ncompletely unimportant at all.\n\n547\n00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.090\nIt's actually extremely important.\n\n548\n00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.680\nYou're gonna see the importance\nof that as we progress.\n\n549\n00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.490\nRonnie, I think you did a fantastic job of\nexplaining those, well, those terms and\n\n550\n00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.900\ndefinitions, getting that\nlanguage built up, so\n\n551\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.840\nthat we can continue to\nhave this conversation.\n\n552\n00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.750\nRonnie, thanks for joining us, man.\n\n553\n00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.810\nI appreciate you dropping by.\n\n554\n00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.380\nI appreciate you good folks out\nthere as well for joining us.\n\n555\n00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.790\nBut it does look like it is that time for\nus to call it off.\n\n556\n00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.576\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n557\n00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:30.506\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n558\n00:30:30.506 --> 00:30:32.532\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n559\n00:30:32.532 -->

great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:19.001\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.439\nwe're continuing on with\nmore in our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.733\nAnd joining us yet again in the studio,\nthe man, the myth, the legend,\n\n9\n00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.416\nyou know him as one Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:29.139\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:33.152\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue on to learn a little bit\n\n12\n00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:35.920\nmore about networking fundamentals.\n\n13\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.640\nIt's always easy, Daniel,\n\n14\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.550\nto actually think let me just\nfast forward through this stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.301\nI don't need any reminders\nabout this stuff but, Daniel,\n\n16\n00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:47.011\nwhen it comes down to exam preparations,\nI hate to say it.\n\n17\n00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.700\nSome of the easiest stuff when people skip\nover it, that's the stuff that they miss.\n\n18\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.576\nAnd on a Cisco exam, Daniel,\nyou and I have taken some of these.\n\n19\n00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:58.027\nMissing the easy stuff counts just\nas badly as missing the hard stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:58.027 --> 00:00:58.562\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n21\n00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:01.060\nthey give you plenty of\nhard stuff to deal with, so\n\n22\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.674\nno good reason to miss the easy stuff.\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\n\n23\n00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.850\nthat's something that I wanna reemphasize,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.326\nSo I'm not saying that you can't skip it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:12.029\nSo in other words if you go I'm 100%\nfamiliar with this, go ahead and move on.\n\n26\n00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:16.840\nBut if you have the least any-\n&gt;&gt; If there's any weak spot in your-\n\n27\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.822\n&gt;&gt; Any smidgen of doubt at all or\n\n28\n00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:22.125\nyou need to review,\nmake sure you review this,\n\n29\n00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.603\nbecause it is as frustrating as it gets,\nDaniel.\n\n30\n00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:27.536\nCuz I face it on Cisco exams as well,\n\n31\n00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:30.376\nwhere it's like yes\nthat's the right answer.\n\n32\n00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:34.146\nClick next, you don't get to go back and\nyou're like that was the wrong answer.\n\n33\n00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:37.215\nI mean, just a millisecond\nafter actually moving on and\n\n34\n00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:39.249\nrealizing I just missed something.\n\n35\n00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.198\nAnd it wasn't because I didn't know it.\n\n36\n00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:44.492\nIt was because I just thought I knew it so\nwell.\n\n37\n00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:47.623\nAnd I just hit an answer and\nthen as soon as I clicked on it,\n\n38\n00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.466\nI was like I can't believe that.\n\n39\n00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.474\nAnd that's just points gone.\n\n40\n00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:55.044\nSo don't overlook this stuff just\nbecause you think it's easy.\n\n41\n00:01:55.044 --> 00:01:58.408\nIf you have any smidgen of a doubt at all,\nokay, and you need review,\n\n42\n00:01:58.408 --> 00:01:59.627\nmake sure you review it.\n\n43\n00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:01.960\nSome of us have been networking for\na long time.\n\n44\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.445\nBut if you haven't reviewed the concepts,\nespecially right before going for\n\n45\n00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:06.934\nthe exam, take the time to do so.\n\n46\n00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:11.814\nThat's just kind of a no-brainer\ntype of thing because it's gonna\n\n47\n00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:14.307\nbe easy points for you on the exam.\n\n48\n00:02:14.307 --> 00:02:19.093\nSo today the reason I'm actually\nemphasizing that, right, is that we\n\n49\n00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:24.301\nare taking a lot at, well two for us,\nthe transport layer protocols, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:27.743\nNow on the transport layer protocols,\nlet's go back and\n\n51\n00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:31.411\ntake a look a the diagram that I\nhave right here on my machine.\n\n52\n00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.385\nAnd we'll make sure that we\ntake a look at this, right?\n\n53\n00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.539\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe TCP/IP model itself.\n\n54\n00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.638\nAnd what we're really focusing\nin on is this transport layer.\n\n55\n00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:44.130\nNow when we start focusing on this\ntransport layer directly underneath\n\n56\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.357\nthe application layer.\n\n57\n00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:48.742\nBut in the OSI model it's directly\nunderneath layers five through\n\n58\n00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:49.536\nseven as well.\n\n59\n00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.226\nAnd actually probably could have\nactually done that one, and\n\n60\n00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.305\nthat would help us out so\nthat we could see this.\n\n61\n00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:57.040\nSo it doesn't matter which\nmodel that you're following.\n\n62\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.317\nOn this transport layer,\n\n63\n00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:01.225\nthose are the protocols that\nwe're really focusing in on.\n\n64\n00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:06.724\nAnd there's two generic ones that we're\nreally going to at least describe,\n\n65\n00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:09.015\ncompare, and contrast for us.\n\n66\n00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:14.194\nWhich is the protocols that\nwe call TCP and UDP, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:19.358\nThose are the two that we need to\nunderstand the most as we get through and\n\n68\n00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:21.265\nget into the exam as well.\n\n69\n00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:23.747\nAs well as understand this for\nthe rest of networking, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:28.692\nThese are probably the two most generic\nprotocols that are used across networks\n\n71\n00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:30.398\nall the time, TCP and UDP.\n\n72\n00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:33.367\nThis is just a type of traffic\nthat we're talking about, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:37.260\nSo before we get into\nthe specifics of TCP and UDP, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.247\nWe wanna make sure that we understand what\nit is that a transport layer does for\n\n75\n00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:44.150\nthe end user, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.820\nSo we've already talked about this in\ndetail about how it actually works in\n\n77\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.332\nterms of the way that data actually\nmoves from one machine to the other.\n\n78\n00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:55.450\nBut what does the transport layer do for\nthe end user is the key,\n\n79\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.185\ncuz that will help you out as well, okay?\n\n80\n00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.293\nSo Daniel, we have at ITProTV\na bunch of employees, and\n\n81\n00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:03.910\nwe're hiring new employees, right, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.172\nNow some of them may be\nexperienced in networking, but\n\n83\n00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:09.582\nI'm gonna say that some of them probably\ndon't know anything about networking.\n\n84\n00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.761\nBut if they don't Daniel, does that\nmean that they can't send an email?\n\n85\n00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.328\n&gt;&gt; Of course not.\n\n86\n00:04:13.328 --> 00:04:14.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, does that mean they can't browse\n\n87\n00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.288\nthrough a Web page?\n\n88\n00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.408\nYeah, yeah you hit send.\n\n89\n00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:20.525\nWell yeah what I'm trying to get\nat is that most of the people that\n\n90\n00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:25.041\nmay of course end up using the Internet,\nemail, instant messaging.\n\n91\n00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:29.096\nIf you're a SnapChatter or if you're on\nInstagram, or whatever it might be, right?\n\n92\n00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:31.954\nWhat are the chances that they\nknow a ton about networking?\n\n93\n00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:35.902\nMost of the time most of us don't know\nanything about networking, but yet\n\n94\n00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:38.200\nwe're still able to do what?\n&gt;&gt; Use networking.\n\n95\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.124\n&gt;&gt; Use networking without ever thinking\n\n96\n00:04:40.124 --> 00:04:40.911\nabout it here.\n\n97\n00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:45.730\nAnd the reason why we can do so\nis that when we're dealing with, and\n\n98\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.496\nI'm gonna use a pop culture example.\n\n99\n00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.587\nLet's take Instagram for example, okay?\n&gt;&gt; I thought something from the 70s was\n\n100\n00:04:51.587 --> 00:04:52.461\ncoming out, knowing Ronnie.\n\n101\n00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:54.575\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna stay modern,\n\n102\n00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:57.119\nthat's a bit beyond me here.\n&gt;&gt; Have you heard of these things\n\n103\n00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.643\ncalled beepers?\n\n104\n00:04:57.643 --> 00:04:59.779\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.586\n&gt;&gt; My fax machine [LAUGH] and\n\n106\n00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:06.188\nmy cell phone.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, look at this, it's nice.\n\n107\n00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:07.801\n&gt;&gt; But let's talk about this, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:12.218\nInstagram, for most of the people that\nuse it, it comes on an application, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:14.679\nWell, that really is that, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:17.129\nIt's that application layer is\nwhat we're really talking about.\n\n111\n00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.231\nNow remember,\nwe're not talking about the breakdown.\n\n112\n00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:22.942\nFor the end user,\nthey look at this in terms of networking.\n\n113\n00:05:22.942 --> 00:05:27.813\nThen I have a clue, how it connects\nthat little app on their smartphone all\n\n114\n00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:30.101\nthe way to the Instagram servers.\n\n115\n00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.124\nThey don't have any of that.\n\n116\n00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:32.293\nThey don't know any of that, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:32.293 --> 00:05:34.941\nWhich is perfectly fine, but\nwhat do they interact with?\n\n118\n00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.990\nThey interact with the application layer,\nokay?\n\n119\n00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.712\nSo they know how to type in stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:42.895\nThey know how to find\nwhoever they're looking for.\n\n121\n00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:44.493\n&gt;&gt; They understand the app itself,\n\n122\n00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:47.299\nnot the underlying foundations\nof how the app is working.\n\n123\n00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:47.911\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n124\n00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:51.039\nwhat does that mean then when\nwe start to take a look at it\n\n125\n00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.011\nfrom the networking standpoint?\n\n126\n00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:59.914\nThe transport layer, it essentially\nhides whatever's happening here.\n\n127\n00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:04.416\nWhatever is happening here,\nwhatever is actually happening here for\n\n128\n00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:07.864\nthe end user, but\nhe can still do networking, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:11.837\nAnd that's kinda the neatest thing,\nat least to me, it's the neat thing, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:11.837 --> 00:06:14.581\nBecause that means that somebody doesn't\nhave to know every single detail-\n\n131\n00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:16.368\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to be a tech wiz to be\n\n132\n00:06:16.368 --> 00:06:19.155\nable to actually have these\nthings enrich your life.\n\n133\n00:06:19.155 --> 00:06:21.603\n&gt;&gt; Right, so in that sense, that's why we\n\n134\n00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:24.375\nalso want to learn about networking.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes things break down.\n\n136\n00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.187\nWell that's where you and\nI are called into the picture and\n\n137\n00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.578\ninto the mix to figure that out.\n\n138\n00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:33.319\nNow Instagram itself is probably\na little more technical than the way I'm\n\n139\n00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.173\ndescribing it.\n\n140\n00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:38.091\nBut for people that end up working in\na business, when things don't connect and\n\n141\n00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:41.085\nthey're not working, right,\nwell we can know something.\n\n142\n00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:43.973\nThe reason why they actually think\nthat is because they're interacting\n\n143\n00:06:43.973 --> 00:06:45.166\nwith the application layer.\n\n144\n00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:49.355\nWhereas you and I, we're actually gonna\ntake a look and go hey, is that something\n\n145\n00:06:49.355 --> 00:06:53.323\nhappening at the transport layer,\nInternet layer, network access layer?\n\n146\n00:06:53.323 --> 00:06:53.849\nWhat is it?\n\n147\n00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.395\nAnd then you can break that down and\n\n148\n00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:58.198\nbegin to figure that out.\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz why spend your time at\n\n149\n00:06:58.198 --> 00:07:01.458\nthe physical layer when you obviously\nhave a connection going on?\n\n150\n00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:04.542\nIt's maybe something at\nthe transport layer or whatever.\n\n151\n00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:07.935\nSo start to narrow down your possibilities\nand make it a whole lot easier to\n\n152\n00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:08.965\ntroubleshoot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n153\n00:07:08.965 --> 00:07:10.283\nit makes it easier to troubleshoot.\n\n154\n00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:14.556\nSo transport layer protocols really do\nhelp us to understand that a little bit\n\n155\n00:07:14.556 --> 00:07:15.570\nbetter.\n\n156\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.510\nThe other thing that it does\nat the transport layer,\n\n157\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.730\nof course, is the idea of segmentation.\n\n158\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.576\nWhich is breaking up the packets so\n\n159\n00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:27.199\nthey fit in the way that\nthe network says it fits, okay?\n\n160\n00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.477\nI know it's the worst phrase in the world.\n\n161\n00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:35.250\nYou can't put ten pounds of\nnails into a five pound bag.\n\n162\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.367\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can do it, Ronnie.\n\n163\n00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:40.558\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna melt those nails down.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n164\n00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:43.861\nthe weird thing is it's normally not used\nwith nails, so that's the other thing.\n\n165\n00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:44.846\n&gt;&gt; What if they make the nails out of\n\n166\n00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:46.444\nlead?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:47.772\n&gt;&gt; Put three nails and it's ten pounds.\n\n168\n00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:49.612\n&gt;&gt; That's true you could do that.\n\n169\n00:07:49.612 --> 00:07:53.143\nBut overall though when you start\nto think about this, right?\n\n170\n00:07:53.143 --> 00:07:56.114\nThere's a ton of data that\nmay be bigger than what\n\n171\n00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:58.800\nthe network actually\nallows to be put on it.\n\n172\n00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.512\nSo, what does a transport layer do?\n\n173\n00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:04.170\nThe transport layer, once again,\nhides this from the end user, right?\n\n174\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.630\nYou're file side is way too\nbig to go onto network.\n\n175\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.102\nWell, it doesn't mean that\nthe end user has to do what?\n\n176\n00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:14.200\nWell let me figure out\nhow to divide up this.\n\n177\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.480\nIs this gonna go here?\n\n178\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.190\nIs this gonna go there?\n\n179\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.590\nThe transport layer also hides that and\n\n180\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.420\nmakes it transparent to\nthe end user as well.\n\n181\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.020\nSo it breaks it down so that now we can\nactually have where that can happen.\n\n182\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.930\nNow the other thing that transport\nlayer protocols help us do, and\n\n183\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.340\nI'm gonna use a technical\nterm at this point,\n\n184\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.780\nis something that we call\nsession multiplexing.\n\n185\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.140\nSo this is by far the most technical term\nthat I've used in the entire series so\n\n186\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.650\nfar.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you're gonna have to slow down,\n\n187\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.722\nwe're nothing but humbled pirates here.\n\n188\n00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:43.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Some big words.\n\n190\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, session multiplexing is something\n\n191\n00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.791\nelse that we already do.\n&gt;&gt; Without even knowing it.\n\n192\n00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:50.461\n&gt;&gt; Most people do and\n\n193\n00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:52.260\ndon't even know anything about it.\n\n194\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.020\nAnd here you are, so\n\n195\n00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.440\nwhen you're using an application you're\nprobably doing a session multiplex.\n\n196\n00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.020\nOkay.\n\n197\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.340\nSo what is that about?\n\n198\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.150\nYou IP address, the thing that really\nidentifies you out on the internet or\n\n199\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.110\nwhatever network you're on.\n\n200\n00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.680\nIt allows multiple applications to use\nthat one IP address over and over again.\n\n201\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.980\nOkay, so they don't actually have to find\na new IP address, it can reuse that.\n\n202\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.210\nAnd once again, the transport layer\nhelps us to hide all that information.\n\n203\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.600\nStill makes you what master of\nnetworking if everything actually works.\n\n204\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.142\nThat you're able to do this without you\nhaving to actually know anything about it.\n\n205\n00:09:25.142 --> 00:09:28.800\nSo there's pretty cool things that it\nactually allows you to do as well.\n\n206\n00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.370\nNow one last thing that also want to\nmention in terms of these layers and\n\n207\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.910\nas far as generic transport layer\nbefore we get into TCP and UDP is at\n\n208\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:44.260\nthe transport layer, it can optionally\nallow you to also do error recovery.\n\n209\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.842\nIt doesn't have to.\n\n210\n00:09:45.842 --> 00:09:49.301\nAnd sometimes you don't\nreally want it to do it, but\n\n211\n00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:53.410\nit can also do that idea of\nerror recovery for you, okay?\n\n212\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.920\nSo that depends on which protocol you're\ngoing to end up using, whether it's TCP or\n\n213\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.960\nUDP.\n\n214\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960\nBut that's what it breaks down to.\n\n215\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.400\nSo when you think that,\nhey, the transport layer,\n\n216\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.428\ndo I need to know anything\nabout it in networking?\n\n217\n00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:09.070\nYes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You need to\n\n218\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.666\nknow just about every\nlittle thing about it.\n\n219\n00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:13.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You need to know something about it,\n\n220\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.190\nokay.\n\n221\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.747\nI'm emphasizing this,\nbecause most people, we spend,\n\n222\n00:10:18.747 --> 00:10:23.583\nin CISCO, right, we spend a ton\nof time talking about the IP.\n\n223\n00:10:23.583 --> 00:10:28.245\n[CROSSTALK] And the MAC address, we spend\na ton of time cuz it's switches and\n\n224\n00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:31.954\nrouters and devices that\nfunction on those layers, okay.\n\n225\n00:10:31.954 --> 00:10:38.003\nWe don’t really spend any bit of time,\nI shouldn’t say that, we don’t really\n\n226\n00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:44.140\nspend a bit of time in understanding\nwhy the transport layer is important.\n\n227\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.862\nOkay, so\nthat's what I'm trying to emphasize.\n\n228\n00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:49.148\nIf you want to know why people\nthey still can network but\n\n229\n00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:53.937\nthey don't know anything about it is\nbecause of the transport does essentially\n\n230\n00:10:53.937 --> 00:10:59.140\nhide everything else underneath this can\nmake it easy for networking to go on.\n\n231\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.360\nSo I salute the transport layer as well.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n232\n00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.650\n&gt;&gt; I do because it really does.\n\n233\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n234\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.420\nIt's actually a full salute here.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n235\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Because it does.\n\n236\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.500\nIt does more than we realize, but\n\n237\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.460\nit does kinda not get the respect\na lot of times because we focus in,\n\n238\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.580\nespecially on Cisco on the IP Layer.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n239\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Like crazy.\n\n240\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.160\nOr the internet layer like crazy.\n\n241\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.210\nBut not too much on the layer four, okay?\n\n242\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.780\nSo it can help us to do that.\n\n243\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.230\nNow I said the last thing.\n\n244\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.880\nThat should've been the penultimate thing.\n\n245\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.190\nLast thing as I looked down on my notes,\nI skipped that one.\n\n246\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.760\nWhich is it can also do what we call.\n\n247\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.470\nIt can make it guaranteed data delivery.\n\n248\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.338\nSo in other words, it can make sure\nthat the data will actually arrive on\n\n249\n00:11:40.338 --> 00:11:44.465\nthe destination machine and that's\npart of that error recovery again, but\n\n250\n00:11:44.465 --> 00:11:48.420\nit is part of guaranteed data delivery\nas well, but it doesn't have to.\n\n251\n00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.690\nSo those are some of the things that we\nwant to emphasize as we move through here.\n\n252\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.660\nTransport layer, very important, but\nlet's get in to this idea of TCP.\n\n253\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.450\nNow what does a header look like when\nyou actually go to the TCP letter?\n\n254\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.720\nHopefully you're not\nfainting at this point.\n\n255\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.532\n&gt;&gt; Boxes of words that rhyme.\n\n256\n00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:08.830\n&gt;&gt; Well when we take a look at horizontal,\n\n257\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:14.560\nit really does turn out to be about 32\nbits of data for each one of these layers.\n\n258\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.080\nOkay?\n\n259\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.866\nWell, I don't wanna count and I don't\nwanna have to multiply [CROSSTALK].\n\n260\n00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:19.686\n&gt;&gt; I'm writing that on my flash card.\n\n261\n00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:20.445\n32 bits.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n262\n00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:20.952\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n263\n00:12:20.952 --> 00:12:21.969\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So across the top, right?\n\n264\n00:12:21.969 --> 00:12:24.740\n16 bits here for the source port.\n\n265\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.763\nYou have port addresses between 0 and\n65535.\n\n266\n00:12:29.763 --> 00:12:31.509\nAnd the same thing with destination.\n\n267\n00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:33.635\nSo that actually is 2 to the 16th power.\n\n268\n00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:34.950\nSo that's what you're seeing there.\n\n269\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.030\nSource port and destination port.\n\n270\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.070\nSo it adds that again.\n\n271\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.660\nIt adds in that sequencing number to\nhelp us to recover when things go wrong.\n\n272\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.790\nIt gives us an acknowledgement number.\n\n273\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.730\nOffsets reserved information, just in\ncase we don't have enough data there.\n\n274\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.060\nChecksum, urgency pointers, window size,\nanother acknowledgement number,\n\n275\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.760\nbut the key for us is right here in this\nlittle section that you see where there is\n\n276\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:06.070\nan urgent, an ACK, a push, a PSH here,\na reset, an RST, a SIN, and a FIN.\n\n277\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.820\nAll of those are individual bits\nof data that are dealt with,\n\n278\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.820\nthat really do control on how TCP ends\nup communicating with each other.\n\n279\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.270\nSo they get one packet that\nhas one these set with a one.\n\n280\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.400\nThe other ones may not be\nset with anything, okay?\n\n281\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.980\nThen the second packet may be set with\na 1 and a 1 in somewhere else, and\n\n282\n00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.590\nthe third packet's set with a 1 again.\n\n283\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.550\nIt just depends on where it goes in, but\nthat's the header that we're seeing.\n\n284\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.580\nNow the great question,\nright, as far as the exam.\n\n285\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.210\nDo I need to memorize, no,\nyou don't need to memorize this.\n\n286\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.050\nBut what you do want to make sure,\n\n287\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:44.790\nif nothing else pay attention to\nthis upper layer right here, okay.\n\n288\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:50.600\nThat at the TCP or transport layer,\nokay, especially with TCP,\n\n289\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.640\nsource port and destination port,\nokay, is the key.\n\n290\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.080\nThis is where we have\nthe logical port numbers\n\n291\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.100\nthat allow us to connect to\nthe application that we need here, okay?\n\n292\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.760\nSo we don't have the destination for\nit, guess what?\n\n293\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.700\nYou don't get to connect to that web\nserver, you don't have port 80 or\n\n294\n00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.740\nport 443 here.\n\n295\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.220\nIt just says, all right,\nI have an application.\n\n296\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.880\nYou don't have a destination port number,\nI don't know what to do with this.\n\n297\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.760\nYeah, so it just kinda sits there and\ngoes all right,\n\n298\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.470\nthere's no destination for this thing.\n\n299\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.390\nSo it drops off, and\nyou don't ever make that connection.\n\n300\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.740\nI just kind of realized.\n\n301\n00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.770\nSo this is the amount of information\nthat we generally see added on as we\n\n302\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.990\ngo down through the TCP IP layers, okay?\n\n303\n00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.260\nNow, once we do that, okay.\n\n304\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.680\nBefore anything is ever\ntransferred as far as data,\n\n305\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.290\njust like we saw,\nthe way that TCP does it is it\n\n306\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:50.420\nsays I want to actually ensure that\nwe have guaranteed data delivery.\n\n307\n00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.121\nAnd that means that all bits of data that\nI want to send from one side to the other,\n\n308\n00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:59.450\nare actually going to get it,\nand that's what it wants to do.\n\n309\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.750\nIt begins with what we call\nthe TCP three way handshake.\n\n310\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.852\nMake sure you know that.\n\n311\n00:15:04.852 --> 00:15:05.364\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.480\n&gt;&gt; I have to emphasize that, okay?\n\n313\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.110\nThree way handshake,\nTCP three way handshake.\n\n314\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:16.700\nSo it's going to do this, this is\nall about synchronizing the sender,\n\n315\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.880\nand the receiver okay,\nthat's what it's about okay?\n\n316\n00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.064\nSo both source and destination,\n\n317\n00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:26.978\nthey have to be synchronized before\nany data is transmitted, because that\n\n318\n00:15:26.978 --> 00:15:32.048\nis what guarantees that data is gonna be\ndelivered from one side to the other.\n\n319\n00:15:32.048 --> 00:15:36.500\nAnd usually in the right sequence\nof the data packets as well, okay?\n\n320\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.380\nSo when they do this, when they\nactually do the three way handshake,\n\n321\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.270\nthe first thing that they do is that they\nsay we established the connection first.\n\n322\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.780\nSo that's what\nthe synchronization is about.\n\n323\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.450\nThis guy says hey,\nI'm ready to sync up with you.\n\n324\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.289\nThe other guy says all right,\nthat's cool, let's go ahead and sync up.\n\n325\n00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:55.673\nAnd I'm also ready to\nsynchronize with you.\n\n326\n00:15:55.673 --> 00:15:56.811\nAnd let's do this.\n\n327\n00:15:56.811 --> 00:16:00.697\nSo in the three way hand shake we want to\npay attention the to colors I have also\n\n328\n00:16:00.697 --> 00:16:05.370\ndrawn here, as well as some of the syntax\nthat you see right here as well.\n\n329\n00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.676\nSo let's say that here it is over on\nthe left hand side I have a client,\n\n330\n00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.280\njust somebody on a work station.\n\n331\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.207\nOn the right hand side I have a server,\nand\n\n332\n00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:17.943\nthis is where when we start to\ndo this communication process.\n\n333\n00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:22.400\nThat we're gonna send in TCP,\nthis is where the client\n\n334\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.300\nbegins to communicate, and\nthey send a control message, a CTL here,\n\n335\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.310\nand it's in the form of an SYN or\na sync packet.\n\n336\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:38.600\nAnd that is just requesting that I want\nto synchronize with you to get data.\n\n337\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.650\nOne the receiving machine, over here on\nthe right-hand side, when it responds\n\n338\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:51.400\nback, it will respond back,\nby sending an acknowledgment here.\n\n339\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.940\nSo ACK is what it sends back.\n\n340\n00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.630\nAnd I want you to pay attention\nto the sequence number.\n\n341\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.785\nNotice that when it actually\nsends here's the sequence 100,\n\n342\n00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:04.840\nhere is where my sync is.\n\n343\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.440\nThe acknowledgement though\nis 101 at this point here.\n\n344\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.600\nThen I acknowledge that, and here it is,\n\n345\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.300\nthat shows you that I am\nstarting to increment this so\n\n346\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.900\nthat you can see that I got your message,\nhere's my message back to you.\n\n347\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.950\nThen it begins to also say I need\nto send my own synchronization.\n\n348\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.960\nSo it is because now, this machine,\noops let me move that back here.\n\n349\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.880\nIt's because now,\nthis machine that was receiving it,\n\n350\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.240\nit also wants to synchronize with\nthe machine over here on the left.\n\n351\n00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.170\nSo it's sending not only its\nacknowledgement, which is here,\n\n352\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.180\nbut it's also sending\na synchronization as well.\n\n353\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.310\nWhen it does that, this machine over on\nthe left-hand side then goes ahead and\n\n354\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.950\nsays, hey, I acknowledge that\n\n355\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:01.090\nwe are actually going to\nacknowledge your synchronization.\n\n356\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.940\nSo this one that actually did the ACK.\n\n357\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.580\nAnd then the sequence here.\n\n358\n00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:11.437\nLet me that should be a 102 I think.\n\n359\n00:18:11.437 --> 00:18:14.566\nSorry, I may have gotten\nthose numbers wrong.\n\n360\n00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:15.430\nLet me see.\n\n361\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.620\nYeah, this is actually 100 on this side\nof the sync, yeah, this should work.\n\n362\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.900\nSo this one should actually do that,\n\n363\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.880\nthen it actually acknowledges\nthe sync sequence here.\n\n364\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.900\nNow, we're actually getting the ACK back.\n\n365\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.590\nNotice it says SYN,\nthere's a SYN/ACK and acknowledgement.\n\n366\n00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.660\nThis ACK is actually responding\nto this SYN packet right here.\n\n367\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.790\nSo synchronization, acknowledgment,\nsynchronization, acknowledgment.\n\n368\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.210\nWhen it finishes transmitting,\nyou may also get a fin packet,\n\n369\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.550\nwhich means that the entire\nprocess was done.\n\n370\n00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.020\nSo each one of these, and\n\n371\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:56.500\ntaking a look at this is what has to go on\nbefore you start to do anything like this.\n\n372\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.850\nSo just remember that, this is before\nany data is actually transmitted.\n\n373\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.730\nOnce we establish that,\nthey call it Connection-Oriented,\n\n374\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.260\nthat means both sides are synced up and\nready to send and receive data.\n\n375\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.310\nBecause of the addition of\nthese sequenced numbers,\n\n376\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.660\nif they somehow get out of order,\nit can do Error Recovery.\n\n377\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.430\nAnd we're also gonna take a look\nat the idea of flow control here,\n\n378\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.510\ntoo, as an example of what TCP or\n\n379\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.760\nTransmission Control Protocol\nalso provides services for.\n\n380\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.820\nNow, I want you to take a look at\nthe lower left hand corner over here too.\n\n381\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.430\nThe reason why is that the uses of this,\njust about, I wanna say,\n\n382\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.930\n80 to 90% of the traffic that we tend to\nuse on the networks that we're on, and\n\n383\n00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.820\nnot even the Internet\nis probably using TCP.\n\n384\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.890\nSo it's probably not even that high,\nand it may actually be getting less.\n\n385\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.520\nWe'll talk about the reason why\nwhen we get to UDP in a moment.\n\n386\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.860\nIf you use email, file sharing,\n\n387\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.730\nif you're downloading anything,\nit has all this information in here.\n\n388\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.300\nAnd it starts to sync it\nup before we realize.\n\n389\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.690\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny when you start thinking\n\n390\n00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:06.275\nabout the services that Ron is showing us,\nthat use TCP, it starts to make sense.\n\n391\n00:20:06.275 --> 00:20:12.090\nEmail, TCP connection oriented, it wants\nto make sure reliable transmission.\n\n392\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.650\nMy email kind of comes it,\nit kind doesn't come in.\n\n393\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.360\nThat doesn't really do me much good.\n\n394\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.570\nFile sharing, same kind of thing.\n\n395\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.080\nIf I get some of the file,\n\n396\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.120\nnot all of the files, it's probably gonna\nbe a garbled mess I can't use anyway.\n\n397\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.410\nYou're downloading anything.\n\n398\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.130\nA binary.\n\n399\n00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.160\nHow great would it be to only\nget most of your binary?\n\n400\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.220\nThat's not gonna run.\n\n401\n00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.640\nSo having TCP run those services makes\na whole lot of sense cuz it's gonna verify\n\n402\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.180\nusing all these processes that\nthat's actually gonna happen.\n\n403\n00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Daniel makes a key.\n\n404\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.990\nKinda brings up this terminology.\n\n405\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.820\nWe're gonna talk about reliable.\n\n406\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.030\nSo I didn't put in on there and\n\n407\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.090\nthe reason why is that people kind of\nstarted having this unusual thing.\n\n408\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.770\nReliable is exactly the term for\n\n409\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.290\nthis because it establishes a connection\nfirst and says both sides are ready to go.\n\n410\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.180\nWhen we take a look at UDP,\nit used to be also called unreliable,\n\n411\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.820\nwhich people meant-\n&gt;&gt; It gets a [CROSSTALK]-\n\n412\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.880\n&gt;&gt; A negative connotation.\n\n413\n00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.471\n&gt;&gt; The word unreliable means I can't use\n\n414\n00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:03.550\nthat, it's unreliable.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just means in a certain way.\n\n415\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.868\nThe context has to be there for\n\n416\n00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:06.883\nyou to understand what that means.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n417\n00:21:06.883 --> 00:21:09.960\nyou do bring up a good term that you'll\nprobably see all over the Internet.\n\n418\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.030\nThey tend to call TCP traffic\nhere reliable as well and\n\n419\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.530\nthat's because it establishes\nthe connection on both sides.\n\n420\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.110\nNow let's take a look at it from\nthe standpoint of error recovery quickly.\n\n421\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.210\nWe've already seen this in a previous\nepisode, but when it comes down to\n\n422\n00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.720\neverything else that it has to do,\nthe sequence numbers are key.\n\n423\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.400\nNow I simplify them by just making\nthem one, two, three and four.\n\n424\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.640\nBut remember that if we send\nthese packets along, and\n\n425\n00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.670\nwe drop one of the packets such as\nsequence number two, error recovery says\n\n426\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.010\nI can take to look at all these sequence\nnumbers as to receiving computer.\n\n427\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.830\nAnd realize which one's missing.\n\n428\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.460\nThen I can send a request for\nthe missing one and\n\n429\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.200\nthat way I have what, the entire sequence.\n\n430\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.250\nSo as basic as it gets that's really\nwhat error recovery helps us to do.\n\n431\n00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.030\nAnd that's why the sequence numbers\nare going to be important as you start to\n\n432\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.540\ntake a look at that.\n\n433\n00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.080\nNow along with that,\none of the other notions which\n\n434\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.870\nI did not touch on in an earlier\nepisode is flow control.\n\n435\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.960\nFlow control is really helpful in,\nif we don't have something like this.\n\n436\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.060\nIt means that every time I send a packet\nwe have to go through the handshake\n\n437\n00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.600\nagain on the second packet.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n438\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.620\n&gt;&gt; And we have to do it for\n\n439\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.570\nthe third packet.\n\n440\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.930\nAnd we have to do it for\nthe fourth, every single time.\n\n441\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.475\nAnd that's gotta be the slowest\nconversation on the planet.\n\n442\n00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:24.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.890\n&gt;&gt; So windows size it gives\n\n444\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.370\nus what we call a TCP flow control.\n\n445\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.120\nSo between the web server and\nthe web browser,\n\n446\n00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:37.070\none of those inside of that header\nthat we saw a little bit earlier.\n\n447\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.020\nInside of the header, we talked about\nthe idea of this Windows size here.\n\n448\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.760\nOnce we get to this point,\nwe can set a Windows size and\n\n449\n00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.150\nI just chose the number\nthree at this point.\n\n450\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:51.730\nIt can also be based not only on the\nnumber of segments here or packets that\n\n451\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.880\nyou receive, but it can be based on size\nand that is normally what it is based on.\n\n452\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.754\nBut here on the window size so let's say\nthat we receive three of these sequences\n\n453\n00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:03.663\nhere, before we actually\nhave to go through and\n\n454\n00:23:03.663 --> 00:23:07.060\nacknowledge what we\nare expecting to see next.\n\n455\n00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.580\nSo here they're saying,\njust go and send them,\n\n456\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.370\nand I'm not gonna check every\ntime that you're actually good.\n\n457\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.190\nI'm just gonna assume that you're good.\n\n458\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.420\nThen on the fourth one right here,\nthis says,\n\n459\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.540\nhey, here's what I'm expecting to see\nnext, which is sequence number 4.\n\n460\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:26.830\nThen it begins or the web server sends\nback 4, 5, and it should send back 6.\n\n461\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.110\nOops, I kind of made a mistake there.\n\n462\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.790\nI went ahead and put a 7 there,\nthat should be a 6, that's what happens.\n\n463\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.890\nSo it actually sends back a 6, and\nthen we actually start sending out,\n\n464\n00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.610\nhey look, window size of 3.\n\n465\n00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.970\nThere it is, 3.\n\n466\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.160\nSo what am I expecting to see next,\nwhich is 7.\n\n467\n00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.179\nSo this allows us to be able to do that,\nand allow for\n\n468\n00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:52.764\nmore data to come through and\nless of these handshakes to have\n\n469\n00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:56.092\nto happen before everything\nelse kind of goes that way.\n\n470\n00:23:56.092 --> 00:23:57.552\nWhen you start seeing this, and\n\n471\n00:23:57.552 --> 00:23:59.889\nit's actually done in terms of data size,\nright?\n\n472\n00:23:59.889 --> 00:24:03.793\nThese numbers will get\na little bit more unusual.\n\n473\n00:24:03.793 --> 00:24:09.430\nCuz it'd be something like a 100 kilobytes\nor 1000 kilobytes for all I know.\n\n474\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.070\nIt just depends on what it does and\n\n475\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.820\nthen you'll see the numbers will actually\nchange as you start to go through.\n\n476\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.860\nBut flow control and error recovery\nare two of the important services\n\n477\n00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.180\nthat you also end up seeing\nwhen you start to do this okay?\n\n478\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.060\nSo by being able to provide something\nlike that, this is a good understanding.\n\n479\n00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.010\nAnd this is why people\ntend to use this for\n\n480\n00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.480\na lot of the different types\nof data that's out there.\n\n481\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.140\nNow we do need to also take a look\nbriefly at the idea of UDP And\n\n482\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.830\nUDP stands for\nuser datagram protocol, okay?\n\n483\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.010\nMake sure you memorize that, okay?\n\n484\n00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.580\nTCP transmission control protocol,\nmemorize that.\n\n485\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Exam alert.\n\n486\n00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exam alert.\n\n487\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.450\nUDP, user datagram protocol.\n\n488\n00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.820\nNotice the difference in the header side,\n\n489\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.500\nit kind of much more sparse.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it seems to be\n\n490\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.470\na whole lot less complex than TCP is.\n\n491\n00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.430\nBut that doesn't mean that\nit's any less usable.\n\n492\n00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.870\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, that's exactly right,\n\n493\n00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.942\nit's not any less usable.\n\n494\n00:25:03.942 --> 00:25:06.180\nSo why do we use one or the other?\n\n495\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.110\nIf you need that guaranteed delivery and\n\n496\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.200\nyou're not really\nconcerned about the speed.\n\n497\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.130\nYou're concerned about what,\n\n498\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:15.346\nmaking sure that every single packet\nget across, then use TCP okay.\n\n499\n00:25:15.346 --> 00:25:20.250\nIf you actually go look I just\nneed the data to get across,\n\n500\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.672\nokay, as quickly as we\ncan UDP is the way to go.\n\n501\n00:25:23.672 --> 00:25:27.100\nNot always about speed but is about quite,\ndo I really need all that?\n\n502\n00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.071\nNow I'm just trying to get the data\nfrom one end to the other.\n\n503\n00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:31.169\nBut that is actually the key here, so\n\n504\n00:25:31.169 --> 00:25:36.320\nnotice we don't have any of the difference\nwindow sizes or anything else like that.\n\n505\n00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.023\nWe do basic data checks on them,\nI don't know, it's just,\n\n506\n00:25:39.023 --> 00:25:41.046\nhere's some data integrity checks, okay?\n\n507\n00:25:41.046 --> 00:25:42.820\nDid it get here full?\n\n508\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.435\nYes, all right, cool.\n\n509\n00:25:44.435 --> 00:25:46.310\n[LAUGH] That's what it does.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for playing.\n\n510\n00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, what if it doesn't?\n\n511\n00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.280\nIt just drops it, okay?\n\n512\n00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.850\nIt just goes, okay, big deal, we lost one.\n&gt;&gt; Now, it's funny, you say things like\n\n513\n00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.750\nthis, Wuan is over here talking about,\nyou know, well, it didn't get there.\n\n514\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.030\nYou're going,\nwhy would I ever even want this?\n\n515\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.960\nAnd believe it or not,\nthere is some really good use case so\n\n516\n00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.750\nthat you're probably not even realizing\nthat you're using UDP4, right?\n\n517\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n518\n00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.820\nactually when you start\nto take a look at it.\n\n519\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.090\nHere's some examples of what\nDaniel's talking about, okay?\n\n520\n00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.890\nSo instead of all the drawings, right.\n\n521\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.750\nIf one guy requests it,\nthe other guys says, I'm sending it, okay?\n\n522\n00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.037\nHe's not really concerned whether or\nnot he's made a connection.\n\n523\n00:26:23.037 --> 00:26:26.370\nHe is not really saying, look,\nI wanna recover every bit of data.\n\n524\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.484\nAnd make sure it gets\nover on the other side.\n\n525\n00:26:27.484 --> 00:26:31.315\nHe is not even even concerned about flow\ncontrol of how much data gets sent over.\n\n526\n00:26:31.315 --> 00:26:33.085\nHe just says, you want it?\n\n527\n00:26:33.085 --> 00:26:34.046\nI'm sending this.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n528\n00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:34.646\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n529\n00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:35.710\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Prepare for the fire hose,\n\n530\n00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.403\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Prepare for\n\n531\n00:26:36.403 --> 00:26:37.418\nit.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n532\n00:26:37.418 --> 00:26:39.385\n&gt;&gt; So why is this usage over here?\n\n533\n00:26:39.385 --> 00:26:43.815\nNotice video streaming,\nvoice streaming, real time services.\n\n534\n00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:45.525\nStuff like this is what we use it for.\n\n535\n00:26:45.525 --> 00:26:48.960\nSo for example,\non Voice telephone calls, right?\n\n536\n00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.840\nIf we did TCP with this, you know Daniel.\n\n537\n00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.060\nImagine what would have\nto happen if one or\n\n538\n00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.790\ntwo of those packets were dropped,\nokay and we used TCP.\n\n539\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.680\nDaniel would hear this unusual\nLooping of all the information again.\n\n540\n00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.890\nIt'd be like a repeat of the conversation,\nof those certain portions\n\n541\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.365\nof the conversation, if it happens.\n&gt;&gt; And not only that,\n\n542\n00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:10.060\nlatency would occur as well.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n543\n00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.820\n&gt;&gt; Because it has to check and re-send.\n\n544\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.756\nAnd it takes time for\nthose computational checks to occur,\n\n545\n00:27:15.756 --> 00:27:18.598\nso I'm kinda behind when it comes to data.\n\n546\n00:27:18.598 --> 00:27:21.641\nI need that data as soon as possible,\ngoing through all those\n\n547\n00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:24.680\nchecks slows that process down.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so,\n\n548\n00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.970\nthe other thing that slows down, right,\nis now you have a broken conversation,\n\n549\n00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.330\ncuz you're not sure whether or not-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n550\n00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.350\n&gt;&gt; You heard the whole thing, and now,\n\n551\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.230\nyou're hearing it again.\n\n552\n00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.040\nAnd you're just like, what happened here?\n&gt;&gt; Are you repeating yourself?\n\n553\n00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.330\nRepeating it.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever's going on, so\n\n554\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.350\nyou end up losing part of message.\n\n555\n00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.670\nBut if you're using UDP,\nif I drop a packet or\n\n556\n00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:47.820\ntwo, Daniel's Internet may not even\nnotice it in terms of a voice message.\n\n557\n00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.543\nNow, I keep dropping a ton of them, then\nit's gonna get some drops, some break.\n\n558\n00:27:51.543 --> 00:27:55.630\nHe's gonna hear a little bit of that,\na little bit of distortion that goes on.\n\n559\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.300\nBut overall, though,\nhe'll be able to, with his mind,\n\n560\n00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.730\ninterpret the rest of\nthe message very easily.\n\n561\n00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.780\nSame thing with video streaming as well,\n\n562\n00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.450\nas you're doing something like what we're\ndoing across the Internet using UDP.\n\n563\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.810\nAnd it doesn't matter if you don't get\nevery single bit of it coming through.\n\n564\n00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.060\nThe reason why is because\nit will stream to you and\n\n565\n00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.680\nyou'll get the majority of\nit that will make sense.\n\n566\n00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.200\nIf it stopped and did TCP Even what you're\nseeing right now, if you're watching live.\n\n567\n00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.075\nYou'd be seeing that again,\n\n568\n00:28:24.075 --> 00:28:28.360\nmaybe in just a few minutes\nmaybe actually in 30 seconds.\n\n569\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.710\nDaniel, it could even happen where it's\nactually, let's say 30 minutes later and\n\n570\n00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.152\njust, you go, the show is over-\n&gt;&gt; At that point it's useless, yeah.\n\n571\n00:28:36.152 --> 00:28:37.359\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it comes back and\n\n572\n00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:38.710\nit's useless.\n\n573\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.840\nWhy is that just kind of kicked up?\n\n574\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.590\nSo it doesn't matter.\n\n575\n00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:48.070\nSo UDP, it's got its usage here that\nwe tend to need to understand as well.\n\n576\n00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.680\nIt is actually used in these,\n\n577\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.010\nespecially here in real time services,\nending like this UDP is always good for.\n\n578\n00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.490\nJust because also known as\nunreliable doesn't make it.\n\n579\n00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.480\nUnreliable in a negative connotation.\n\n580\n00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.830\nWhat it's saying is,\nI don't establish a connection first.\n\n581\n00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.210\nI just need the data to actually\nget from one side to the other.\n\n582\n00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.290\nI don't worry about extra services here\nbecause I'm all about sending the data,\n\n583\n00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.950\nthat's all it's about.\n\n584\n00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.040\nIt really does work effectively and\nfor things like streaming services.\n\n585\n00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.130\nIt is the best thing in the world to use.\n\n586\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.150\nBecause everybody will get\nwhat they're expecting to get\n\n587\n00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.790\nwithout ever having to worry about\nany other delays or anything else.\n\n588\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.310\nIt will kind of, you know,\nmake that happen as much as possible.\n\n589\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.059\nNow, surrounding all this, to deal\nwith things like delay and gender and\n\n590\n00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:34.973\nstuff like that.\n\n591\n00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:38.150\nThere's a bunch of other\nthings that can happen.\n\n592\n00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.324\nBut at least at the basic level here,\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n593\n00:29:41.324 --> 00:29:48.055\nIt is really all about the ideas of what\nUDP offers and why we'd choose to do that.\n\n594\n00:29:48.055 --> 00:29:51.900\nAnd make sure as you get ready for\nthe exam, understand, of course,\n\n595\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.620\nnot only the differences between them but\nalso that connection.\n\n596\n00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:01.120\nThat layer four of the OSI model,\nmake sure that you get that down, too.\n\n597\n00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.570\nBut don't overlook this if you\nhave any doubts about this,\n\n598\n00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.290\nmake sure you review the concepts.\n\n599\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.400\nDo a bit more reading on it okay.\n\n600\n00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.290\nSo my mind is kind of taking me back and\nI'm going to figure it out probably later.\n\n601\n00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.410\nBut the sequence number I don't know\nwhy that kind of confused me for\n\n602\n00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.800\na moment as I was reading through it.\n\n603\n00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.620\nBut I think I got it right at that point.\n\n604\n00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.780\nBut if I didn't,\nyou'll kind of be able to research and go,\n\n605\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.660\nRonnie got that one wrong.\n\n606\n00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:29.688\nSo just kind of realize but remember,\nhey this is as important as anything.\n\n607\n00:30:29.688 --> 00:30:31.324\nBecause it counts toward the exam and\n\n608\n00:30:31.324 --> 00:30:32.870\nthat's the key.\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie you\n\n609\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.910\ngot a whole lot more right than you got\nwrong in my estimation, that's for sure.\n\n610\n00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.530\nA lot of good information here,\n\n611\n00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.130\nthis is foundational networking\nknowledge that you must know.\n\n612\n00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.200\nRegardless of whether or not you're\ngetting ready for an exam for Cisco.\n\n613\n00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.100\nThis is the stuff that you\nhave to have locked down tight\n\n614\n00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.830\ninside of your brain when it comes\nto working in a networking field.\n\n615\n00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.675\nSo just get prepared for that,\nthis is gonna be your bread and butter.\n\n616\n00:30:54.675 --> 00:30:58.475\nRonnie you did a fantastic job in\nmy estimation of disseminating that\n\n617\n00:30:58.475 --> 00:30:59.597\ninformation to us.\n\n618\n00:30:59.597 --> 00:31:01.300\nSo we could understand it,\nIt was very understandable.\n\n619\n00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.790\nI appreciate your time on that.\n\n620\n00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.750\nAppreciate your time out there as well,\nbut I'm looking at our clock.\n\n621\n00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.120\nAnd I think it's ticked it's last time for\nthis episode anyway.\n\n622\n00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.070\nDon't worry,\nwe got more on this series to come.\n\n623\n00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.930\nBut as far as this one goes, we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV,\n\n624\n00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.430\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n625\n00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.390\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next

00:00:16.642\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:19.974\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n8\n00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:22.970\nwe're continuing on with\nmore In our CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.400\nJoining us in the studio today, the master\nblaster himself, my good friend,\n\n10\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.480\none Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.081\nRonnie, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.936\n&gt;&gt; It is going great,\nDaniel, thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:34.070\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on in our journey here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.410\nLearning a little bit more about\nthe networking fundamentals for,\n\n15\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.120\nof course, the Cisco CCENT\nexam as we start to do this.\n\n16\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.950\nAnd also of course hopefully\ngiving you a little bit\n\n17\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.550\nmore knowledge as you prepare for\nyour next journey into networking.\n\n18\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.150\nRemember that as we start,\nespecially on this episode, we're\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.630\ntaking a look at different enterprise\ncomponents that we tend to find.\n\n20\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.300\nIn other words, the security components,\nthe different devices, that you and\n\n21\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.060\nI are gonna run into in networking.\n\n22\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.270\nThat we wanna make sure that\nwe understand what they do and\n\n23\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.050\nwhere they're normally placed.\n\n24\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.450\nMost of us that don't have much\nexperience at all in networking,\n\n25\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.740\nwe're used to working with\nour own computer, and\n\n26\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.750\nmaybe with a wireless access point,\na couple of monitors.\n\n27\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.902\nBut overall, though,\n\n28\n00:01:22.902 --> 00:01:26.940\nthat doesn't describe anywhere near the\nnumber of devices that we can talk about.\n\n29\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.353\nAnd some of the functions that\nthose devices have in networking.\n\n30\n00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:34.385\nAnd today we're gonna expose you to\na little bit more of that, show you what\n\n31\n00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:38.691\nthe impact of these things are, and even\ntalk about topology just a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:40.921\nBecause everybody does things\na little bit differently,\n\n33\n00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.730\nso it depends on what you're doing.\n\n34\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.934\nBut the focus of what we're taking a look\nat of course has to do with connectivity\n\n35\n00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.081\nas well as security.\n\n36\n00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.172\nSo that's what we want to\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n37\n00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:53.573\nThere's really jut a few\ndifferent components,\n\n38\n00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:55.924\neverybody will have\ndifferent flavors of this.\n\n39\n00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:59.792\nCisco, of course, has their brand of\nstuff, which, since we're talking\n\n40\n00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:03.430\nabout Cisco certification,\nthat's what we're gonna be leaning on.\n\n41\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.080\n&gt;&gt; Probably gonna put\nthe emphasis on that one.\n\n42\n00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.480\n&gt;&gt; We are pretty much gonna put\nthe emphasis on the Cisco brand of things.\n\n43\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.850\nSo go figure, I wonder why,\nbut that's what it's gonna be.\n\n44\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.600\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nthat will help us to get set up and\n\n45\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.380\nto take a look at as we get started.\n\n46\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.440\nSo different enterprise networking\ncomponents, well, depending on\n\n47\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.950\nthe size of your network, I've kind\nof blown this out a little bit more.\n\n48\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.702\nNot every network will have\nevery one of these components,\n\n49\n00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:31.582\nbut some networks will and some won't.\n\n50\n00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:35.430\nRight, smaller networks may not\nhave anything but one of these.\n\n51\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.150\nNetworks may not have anything that's\nactually on my screen except for\n\n52\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.190\na wireless access point of some sort,\nor a wireless router.\n\n53\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.555\nBut for us, we're gonna take a look\nat it from the enterprise side,\n\n54\n00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:49.997\nwhich normally means better\ninfrastructure, different devices.\n\n55\n00:02:49.997 --> 00:02:52.938\nAs well as redundancies at times\nthat we have to know about, so\n\n56\n00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.441\nwe're gonna discuss these\ndifferent components.\n\n57\n00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:00.797\nSo today, in our episodes, we're gonna\ntake a look at the idea of firewalls,\n\n58\n00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:05.279\nwe're gonna talk about switches and\nrouters and access points.\n\n59\n00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.597\nAnd some of the different terminology that\nyou're also gonna hear from Cisco as well.\n\n60\n00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:14.225\nAnd make sure that we understand what they\ndo, just a basic overview of what they do.\n\n61\n00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:18.577\nAnd then describe of course where they\nnormally end up functioning for us and\n\n62\n00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:20.730\nwhat we want to take a look at.\n\n63\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.172\nSo when we start to build up a network and\n\n64\n00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:26.729\nsome of the components that we\nmay end up taking a look at.\n\n65\n00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.413\nNotice that from right to left here, okay,\n\n66\n00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:32.546\nI have the Internet over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n67\n00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:37.567\nAnd over on the right hand side,\nreally going towards our LAN environment,\n\n68\n00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:41.187\nour local area network, and\ntrying to keep it linear.\n\n69\n00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:47.224\nSo that we kind of see that side as we\nkind of go deeper into our network here.\n\n70\n00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:50.893\nSo not everything's gonna normally be\nexactly this way, but at least linear,\n\n71\n00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:54.870\nwe can actually describe its\nprogression in this sense, right?\n\n72\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.130\nNow, when we take a look\nat this diagram and\n\n73\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.800\nsome of the enterprise\nnetworking components.\n\n74\n00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.770\nRemember that in our network itself,\nin what people work with every day, and\n\n75\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.063\nthe data and the machines that they're on,\nand everything else.\n\n76\n00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:11.103\nThose are components\nthat we want to protect.\n\n77\n00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:15.240\nWe also want those components to be\nable to communicate with each other.\n\n78\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.670\nAnd we want users, of course,\nto be able to use them.\n\n79\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.550\nAs we move towards the left hand side\nof the screen, ultimately, what we have\n\n80\n00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.250\nout here of course is the Internet itself,\nwhich we have no control over at all.\n\n81\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.360\nSo there are several components that we\nmay run across as we start to do this.\n\n82\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.210\nLet's kind of start with the simple\nones that we tend to think about.\n\n83\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.850\nOn the edge of our networks, normally\nin today's day and age, it can actually\n\n84\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.410\nbe a couple of different ways, but\nlet's talk about the idea of a firewall.\n\n85\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.060\nNow, a firewall is,\nactually I do have a little diagram here,\n\n86\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.000\nof a little brick wall that is here.\n\n87\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.157\nIn the Cisco world they call this an ASA,\nright,\n\n88\n00:04:58.157 --> 00:05:02.868\nadaptive security appliance is what\nthis one's actually called here.\n\n89\n00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:07.941\nAnd a firewall's basic function, okay,\nreally divides our network, okay,\n\n90\n00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:12.651\ninto a couple of different things,\nor what we're actually trying to do.\n\n91\n00:05:12.651 --> 00:05:13.341\nOne side,\n\n92\n00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:19.270\nusually there's a single port that we have\nthat essentially is an untrusted side.\n\n93\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.750\nAnd that is what we\nare protecting against, so\n\n94\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.970\nthat's what a firewall can do for us.\n\n95\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.120\nAnd it actually says, hey,\nhere's what we're protecting against here.\n\n96\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.937\nSo the untrusted side means,\nwe don't know how much control or\n\n97\n00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:32.966\nwe don't know who's actually on this side.\n\n98\n00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.445\nBut we have that on one\nside of the firewall,\n\n99\n00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:40.970\non the other side of the firewall\nis the trusted network.\n\n100\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.487\nUsually the components that you and\nI have put together and\n\n101\n00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:47.520\nthe network itself that\nwe are trying to protect.\n\n102\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.290\nThe way that these ASAs end up\nworking by default is simple.\n\n103\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.980\nOn the untrusted side, nobody gets\nin without your permission, okay,\n\n104\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.650\nit's locked up.\n\n105\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.367\nIt just says, nope, you can connect me and\nI can give you connectivity.\n\n106\n00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:06.046\nBut you're not actually sending traffic\nthat you don't know anything about over\n\n107\n00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.300\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n108\n00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.977\nSo traffic coming in from the Internet\njust trying to make an initial connection,\n\n109\n00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:17.203\nthe firewall says, you're connecting\nto an untrusted port initially.\n\n110\n00:06:17.203 --> 00:06:21.690\nNo, I'm not allowing you to come in,\nnow, can that change?\n\n111\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.410\nYes, you can open it up by poking holes in\nyour firewall temporarily, as you need to.\n\n112\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.270\nBut by default, it is locked up, so\n\n113\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.880\nno outside traffic, initiating traffic,\ncoming into my network is gonna work.\n\n114\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.456\nNow, on the trusted side,\nthough, usually, by default,\n\n115\n00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:44.303\nall these devices can reach out and\ngo through to the Internet and\n\n116\n00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:47.560\nreturn traffic is allowed to come back in.\n\n117\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.436\nBut overall though, it actually says,\nyes, you going out is perfectly fine, but\n\n118\n00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:56.279\non the outside coming back in,\nit's gonna end up being blocked.\n\n119\n00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.030\nFirewalls are normally one of the things\nthat we can do that really do help provide\n\n120\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.260\ninitial, we'll call perimeter security.\n\n121\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.030\nNow, we're gonna talk about this\nrouter a little bit later on.\n\n122\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.180\nCuz we're gonna spend, essentially,\n\n123\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.540\na good portion of this entire series\non routers as well as the switches.\n\n124\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.960\nSo we're talking about just a few\nof the other components too.\n\n125\n00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.190\nNow the other thing that we also have\nthat you can have inside a network is,\n\n126\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.800\nnot only do you have a firewall,\nwhich is normally good.\n\n127\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.970\nIn this firewall, these things have\nadvanced over the years, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.929\nWhere it used to just do simple packet\ninspection as far as filtering,\n\n129\n00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:37.094\nI should say packet filtering\nis what it actually does.\n\n130\n00:07:37.094 --> 00:07:41.766\nWhich says, hey, we're dropping packets\nbased on whatever filter that we want,\n\n131\n00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:42.778\nperfectly fine.\n\n132\n00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:45.414\nToday, though, they've advanced this, so\n\n133\n00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:49.063\nwhen you hear the term like\nnext-generation firewall, okay,\n\n134\n00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:52.929\nthat's actually been a pretty\npopular term for several years now.\n\n135\n00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:58.560\nOr NGIPS,\nwhich is the next generation IPS here.\n\n136\n00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.740\nAll that can be wrapped up in these\nfirewall components as dedicated\n\n137\n00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.995\ncomponents today, and\nthat's because Cisco, several years ago,\n\n138\n00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:09.990\nbought a company called Sourcefire.\n\n139\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.940\nAnd when they first bought that company\ncalled Sourcefire, it was because of what\n\n140\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.060\nthey could do, which was just more than\nwhat the standard packet filtering did.\n\n141\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.930\nDid deeper packet inspection,\ndid a lot more different things.\n\n142\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.570\nAnd at the beginning, they called it\nSourcefire ASAs or something, but\n\n143\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.364\ntoday it's all underneath\na general moniker of Firepower.\n\n144\n00:08:29.364 --> 00:08:32.520\nSo whenever you hear somebody\nreferring to Firepower,\n\n145\n00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.460\nit usually is an ASA of some type\nthat has special components,\n\n146\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.090\nhardware components in it that does\nthe Firepower or the Sourcefire\n\n147\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:47.330\nsoftware of what it does to do everything\nthat it needs to, and it is massive.\n\n148\n00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.340\nThere's no other way to describe this.\n\n149\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.136\nYou wanna learn more about it.\n\n150\n00:08:50.136 --> 00:08:53.495\nMake sure you check out some\nof our other Cisco shows,\n\n151\n00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:57.265\nespecially on the cybersecurity\nshows that we have there.\n\n152\n00:08:57.265 --> 00:09:01.670\nCuz we dive right into the idea of\na Firepower Management Center, and\n\n153\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.460\nwe show you some of the stuff it can do.\n\n154\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.760\nIt's amazing about how much information\nit can actually track, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.930\nSo when you hear ASA, it could be just\na plain-Jane ASA, but today, most of\n\n156\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.180\nthe time, it's gonna be some Firepower\ndevice, is what it's gonna turn out to be.\n\n157\n00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.840\nNow, along the path here,\nI also put an IPS, which stands for\n\n158\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.850\nintrusion prevention system, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.390\nNow, an IPS can work in\na couple of different ways.\n\n160\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.490\nIt can be an intrusion detection system,\nor\n\n161\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.480\nan intrusion prevention system here, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.970\nAn intrusion prevention system\nis exactly what you see.\n\n163\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.380\nIt's inline, from traffic coming from\nthe outside going to the inside.\n\n164\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.420\nNotice that no other device is directly\nconnected to the firewall here.\n\n165\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.620\nIt's all going through this IPS.\n\n166\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.020\nSo the IPS gives us the ability to\nadd in signatures that will say,\n\n167\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.020\nhey, this is what I believe\nan intrusion looks like, and\n\n168\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.485\nit will start to filter out,\nbased on those signatures.\n\n169\n00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:59.417\nIPSs are picky devices.\n\n170\n00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:01.240\nI don't know how else to describe them.\n\n171\n00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.390\nYou can't just go, all right, I'm turning\non the IPS, and then expect it to work.\n\n172\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.720\nYou have to train this thing, so you have\nto actually go, here's what's allowed,\n\n173\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.630\nhere's what's not allowed.\n\n174\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.560\nAnd it takes a little bit of time for\nit to get up to speed\n\n175\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.798\nbefore you've got it tweaked or\ntuned the way that you want to so\n\n176\n00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:18.435\nthat it actually only allows\nthe traffic that you want to come in.\n\n177\n00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:22.829\nAn IPS is good because it's prevention\nhere, an intrusion prevention.\n\n178\n00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:24.970\nIt will stop intrusions.\n\n179\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.600\nSo after the firewall pretty much\nrejects all the traffic that we go,\n\n180\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.000\nyou're originating from the outside,\n\n181\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.580\nif somehow there is an intrusion that\ncomes back in, the IPS can then say,\n\n182\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.160\nno, I'm filtering you out at this point,\nif you choose to, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.640\nSo that is another one.\n\n184\n00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.920\nNow, once again, Cisco has their own\nCisco IPS system that's out there.\n\n185\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.720\nBut because of the popularity and\nthe incredible versatility of Firepower,\n\n186\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.770\neven their IPS systems have kind of\ntaken a backseat to the Firepower stuff.\n\n187\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.130\nSo you might even see that.\n\n188\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.860\nNow, these devices are expensive.\n\n189\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.689\nWhether you're talking about Firepower or\nwhether you're talking about IPSs,\n\n190\n00:11:02.689 --> 00:11:03.762\nthey are insanely expensive.\n\n191\n00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:06.625\n&gt;&gt; You have to come up with the wallet\nwhen it comes to these guys, but\n\n192\n00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:09.170\nthey are extremely effective devices.\n\n193\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.038\nThe fact that you can even upload or\nput into these devices your private key so\n\n194\n00:11:14.038 --> 00:11:17.080\nthat it can even decrypt\ntraffic to make sure and\n\n195\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.840\nverify that no malfeasance is happening.\n\n196\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then re-encrypt the traffic and\n\n197\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.070\nsend it on its way.\n\n198\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.910\nIt's that deep level of\ninspection that's going on there.\n\n199\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.850\nThey are no joke, and they do a great job.\n\n200\n00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.760\n&gt;&gt; They do, they're very effective,\nthey really help you out, and\n\n201\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.470\nthe great thing is it's not that\nyou're detecting an intrusion.\n\n202\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.700\n[LAUGH] It reminds me of\na commercial that's happening.\n\n203\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.980\nThere's a bank guard that's\nstanding there like, yeah, no,\n\n204\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.200\nthere's a bank robbery going on.\n\n205\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.900\n&gt;&gt; They're robbing that\nbank right now [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.130\n&gt;&gt; They say, well, do something,\nand the guard's saying, no,\n\n207\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.400\nI'm just a detection system.\n\n208\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just hired me to tell\nyou when you're getting robbed.\n\n209\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.925\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n210\n00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:52.762\nintrusion detection systems do work,\n\n211\n00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:56.446\nand the very fact that they do alert us\nto the different things that can happen.\n\n212\n00:11:56.446 --> 00:12:00.064\nBut they don't really do anything about\nit, but their key is to log it, right,\n\n213\n00:12:00.064 --> 00:12:03.630\nis to make sure that they understand\nwhat has happened at this point.\n\n214\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.400\nNow, a lot of times, the IPS and the IDS,\nthey're kind of similar devices.\n\n215\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.060\nIt just depends on their\nplacement in the network.\n\n216\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.230\nSo you have it inline in your network,\n\n217\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.880\nlike what I have it,\nit's an intrusion prevention system.\n\n218\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.550\nIf I have it just as another device\noff of this switch 1 over here,\n\n219\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.280\nit becomes an intrusion detection system.\n\n220\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.690\nCuz what I'm doing is I'm telling\nthe switch, hey, any copy that comes in on\n\n221\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.550\nthis one port, send a copy of it over\nto the intrusion detection system.\n\n222\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.640\nAnd that means it can get\nto its destination, and\n\n223\n00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.870\nif an intrusion happens,\nit will detect it.\n\n224\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.470\nOkay, but here we're using it as an IPS.\n\n225\n00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.334\nSo the same thing that we were talking\nabout, whereas essentially what happens,\n\n226\n00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:46.039\nright, with Firepower is you take the\npower of the ASA, in terms of hardware.\n\n227\n00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:50.110\nAnd then you take the power of an IPS\nsystem and the hardware behind that,\n\n228\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.760\nas well as the software behind it,\nyou combine them together.\n\n229\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.080\nThat's essentially what Firepower does for\nus, so it gives us a next-generation\n\n230\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.790\nfirewall, or not firewall, as well as\na next-generation IPS to help us out.\n\n231\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.750\nNow, we also have a switch, which we'll\ntalk about a little bit more in detail in\n\n232\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:13.398\nanother series, but here, notice the idea\nof AP1, which is access point one.\n\n233\n00:13:13.398 --> 00:13:17.599\nAccess point 1 helps to extend\nour broadcast domain by\n\n234\n00:13:17.599 --> 00:13:22.220\nallowing us to no longer be bounded\nby the media that we're tied to.\n\n235\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.920\nWe can now extend our broadcast domain\nusing radio frequency waves, instead, and\n\n236\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.640\nsimple access points, by themselves,\nokay, do help us out.\n\n237\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.100\nNow, there is one device that\nI did forget to put in here.\n\n238\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.335\nAs I looked, I was like,\nI'm missing one of these.\n\n239\n00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:39.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so let me make a copy of this one,\n\n240\n00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:42.084\nand then I'll just add it in between here,\n\n241\n00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:45.609\nis what we'll do, and\nwe'll call this one a WLC.\n\n242\n00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:53.941\nOkay, now, WLC stands for wireless LAN\ncontroller, is what that one stands for,\n\n243\n00:13:53.941 --> 00:14:00.340\nif I can actually make that work, and\na wireless LAN controller is great.\n\n244\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.810\nBecause what it can do for our networks\nthat we have right here is that\n\n245\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.010\nif we have multiple\nwireless access points,\n\n246\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.910\nI can just make a configuration\non the wireless LAN controller.\n\n247\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:16.270\nAnd then push out those configurations\nto the access points themselves, and\n\n248\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.250\nnow I have less administrative overhead,\nokay?\n\n249\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.460\nThat less administrative overhead\nmeans that I can spend more time\n\n250\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.190\nmaking sure that other\nthings are actually good.\n\n251\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.891\nBut I can control, essentially,\n\n252\n00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:30.186\nthe entire wireless network using\nthat wireless LAN controller.\n\n253\n00:14:30.186 --> 00:14:34.300\nI can control the frequency that\nwe're actually on, a lot of times.\n\n254\n00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.950\nI can control the,\nI can't say it, antenna.\n\n255\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.100\nI don't know why I was missing the N.\n\n256\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.090\nI was saying atenna.\n\n257\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.398\nI was like, that's not right.\n\n258\n00:14:43.398 --> 00:14:44.566\n&gt;&gt; Atenna.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, antenna strength.\n\n259\n00:14:44.566 --> 00:14:45.081\n&gt;&gt; It's lacking atenna.\n\n260\n00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:48.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, yeah,\nhe's lacking atenna, which means he needs-\n\n261\n00:14:48.363 --> 00:14:49.067\n&gt;&gt; Sans tenna.\n\n262\n00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:49.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n263\n00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he needs a baritone, [LAUGH] no,\n\n264\n00:14:52.739 --> 00:14:53.280\nsorry.\n\n265\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.910\nLet's make it stop, Ronnie.\n\n266\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.454\n&gt;&gt; I know, we need to.\n\n267\n00:14:54.454 --> 00:14:55.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n268\n00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:58.172\nthat's what the access point does for\nus, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:58.172 --> 00:15:02.890\nNow, it's actually very key here,\nright, these wireless LAN controllers.\n\n270\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.722\nMost of the time, in our own homes,\nwe run what was called a wireless router.\n\n271\n00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:07.770\nIt's essentially a multilayer device.\n\n272\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.320\nIt functions as a router, a switch,\nas well as a wireless access point, but\n\n273\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.110\nin large enterprise networks, you may just\nhave access points that only do that.\n\n274\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:22.063\nSo now, with this wireless LAN controller\nbeing connected into this switch here,\n\n275\n00:15:22.063 --> 00:15:25.719\nokay, as well,\nonce we connect that, we can now,\n\n276\n00:15:25.719 --> 00:15:30.672\nof course, control those access\npoints that help us to manage that.\n\n277\n00:15:30.672 --> 00:15:33.560\nAnd usually, that's because you\nhave multiple ones to do so.\n\n278\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.420\nOne of the systems that I ended\nup help set up is that there were\n\n279\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.570\n25 access points.\n\n280\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.470\nAnd we wanted to make sure that users\ncould actually use certificates for\n\n281\n00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:49.670\nauthentication, instead of actually having\nto type in the password every time.\n\n282\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:54.498\nWell, how do you do that on\n25 access points to do that?\n\n283\n00:15:54.498 --> 00:15:57.970\nYou could individually do that, but what\nwe did is we set up a certificate server.\n\n284\n00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.460\nWe connected a wireless LAN controller and\nthen we pushed out the certificates.\n\n285\n00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.181\nThat's easy enough, it was a little\nbit more challenging than that, but\n\n286\n00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:05.850\nit did work.\n\n287\n00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:11.000\nI didn't have to walk around to\nall 25 access points to do so, so\n\n288\n00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.710\nyou do have things like that\nthat really do help us out.\n\n289\n00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.130\nSo wireless LAN controllers are kind\nof the ones that are called out to,\n\n290\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.430\nit's on the exam, right.\n\n291\n00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:24.460\nMake sure you pay attention to ASA,\nthe idea of the next generation IPS and\n\n292\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.240\nnext generation firewall, wireless LAN\ncontrollers, as well as access points.\n\n293\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.535\nNow, the other devices that we\nare gonna spend a ton of time on, and\n\n294\n00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:38.369\nwe'll talk about this part down here\nat the bottom in a moment here, okay,\n\n295\n00:16:38.369 --> 00:16:40.386\nswitches and routers, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:40.386 --> 00:16:44.275\nRemember that a switch is, for\nus, a connectivity device, and\n\n297\n00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:47.595\nit also allows us to do much\nmore inside of our network.\n\n298\n00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:51.166\nSuch as separate out broadcast\ndomain if we need to,\n\n299\n00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:54.450\nby using something called VLANs.\n\n300\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.720\nJust about on any network\nthat you'll come across,\n\n301\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.170\nyou'll end up seeing that if nothing else,\nyou'll have at least a switch\n\n302\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.870\non the network to connect\nall those devices together.\n\n303\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.320\nThe other one is the idea of a router,\nnow, believe it or not,\n\n304\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.580\na router and a basic firewall can\ndo pretty much the same thing.\n\n305\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.910\nWe can turn on access control list and\ndo basic filtering if we need to.\n\n306\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.100\nBut an ASA by itself or\n\n307\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.010\na firewall by itself is probably\nmuch better at doing it.\n\n308\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.396\nWhereas routers also have to route\nthe traffic at the same time.\n\n309\n00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:30.220\nPuts a little bit more strain on\nthe hardware that we have available to us.\n\n310\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.560\nSo it just depends on what\nyou need to set up here.\n\n311\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.481\nTraditionally, the model that you\ntend to see in enterprise networks is\n\n312\n00:17:38.481 --> 00:17:43.090\nthe one that I have up here on this\ntop branch that kind of goes along.\n\n313\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.394\nIt’s not every time, but it’s typical\nin terms of the way that the data or\n\n314\n00:17:47.394 --> 00:17:49.870\nthe devices are in line, right.\n\n315\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.360\nYou have a router that really\nseparates you from the Internet.\n\n316\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.500\nBut then it routes\nthe traffic to the firewall,\n\n317\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.653\nthis is the first place where\nit begins the filtering.\n\n318\n00:17:58.653 --> 00:18:02.140\nThen the IPS inspects the traffic\nthat's left over, and\n\n319\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.210\nthen it gets on to your network.\n\n320\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.640\nThere are people out there that swear that\nthis is the way you should do it instead,\n\n321\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.070\nwhich is down here at the bottom,\nthat you put the IPS before the firewall.\n\n322\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:20.200\nNow if you do that, you can filter\nout a ton of traffic right away, but\n\n323\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.850\nthere is a cost that's\nactually involved here.\n\n324\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.540\nRemember that this is based\noff of signatures, right.\n\n325\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.311\nThat means that every single packet\nof data sent to that interface,\n\n326\n00:18:30.311 --> 00:18:35.160\nit has to match it against some signature,\nor not match it against some signature.\n\n327\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.960\nThat slows down everything, okay,\nand I mean slows down everything,\n\n328\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.570\nI mean to a crawl,\nit can slow down everything.\n\n329\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.153\nAnd it also means that if you\ndon't have updated signatures,\n\n330\n00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:46.520\nthings are gonna slip through very easily.\n\n331\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.678\nWhereas this one by default says,\nwell, blocked, yeah.\n\n332\n00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:53.740\nI just look at the IP address, you're\nnot from the inside, you're blocked,\n\n333\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.820\nyou're not coming in,\nit's just not gonna happen.\n\n334\n00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.040\nSo I like following this\ntraditional model more, but\n\n335\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.610\nthere are people out there that swear\nthat this is the way to go instead, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.040\n&gt;&gt; It seems like your way would\nbe better just because you've\n\n337\n00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.468\ndropped the amount of traffic that the IPS\nhas to deal with right out of the gate.\n\n338\n00:19:11.468 --> 00:19:15.700\nWhich increases the speed of\nthe way that it's gonna work, and\n\n339\n00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.210\njust cuz it has less to process.\n\n340\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's what I think too,\nbut once again, every time I\n\n341\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.430\nthink something like that, somebody always\nkinda goes, no, that's not how it works.\n\n342\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.160\nAnd you're like okay, well, I just wanted\nto show you both because you never know.\n\n343\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.370\nSo what am I saying, is there a right\nway and a wrong way, probably,\n\n344\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.690\nbut I don't know which one it is.\n\n345\n00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.870\nBut what I'm telling you is,\n\n346\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.490\nyou may end up getting hired at a company,\nand here it is.\n\n347\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.960\nYou go, hey, Ronnie said that this\nis how you're supposed to do it.\n\n348\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.930\nAnd then they go, that Ronnie is nuts,\nhe's not supposed to do that.\n\n349\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.700\nSo I wanted to show you both, okay,\nI believe that this is the right way,\n\n350\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.200\nwhich is the top way to\nactually do this right here.\n\n351\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.380\nAnd to me, it does make sense, but\n\n352\n00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.160\nthere are people that argue that\nthe IPS should actually be first.\n\n353\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.268\nYou do a get a lot more blocking\nright here over the IPS, but\n\n354\n00:20:02.268 --> 00:20:06.603\na that's a lot of traffic to have to block\nagainst every signature that you have.\n\n355\n00:20:06.603 --> 00:20:10.320\nYeah, you're gonna be updating like\ncrazy to try and do stuff like that.\n\n356\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.520\nI'd rather actually block it after the\ndevice is actually designed for, right.\n\n357\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.573\nThe firewall is designed to eat up traffic\nthat you don't want to come in just by\n\n358\n00:20:18.573 --> 00:20:22.550\ndefault, so\nthat's my particular conclusion.\n\n359\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.840\nBut do make sure that you pay\nattention to each one of these.\n\n360\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.440\nThat doesn't mean you have to know\nevery single detail about every single\n\n361\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.400\none of these.\n\n362\n00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.744\nBut for\nthose of you that want to go on and\n\n363\n00:20:32.744 --> 00:20:35.740\nlearn more about some of these devices,\nyou are.\n\n364\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.113\nYou're gonna learn more about the routers\nand switches not only in this series, but\n\n365\n00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.850\nalso in the CCNA show\nthat will be coming up.\n\n366\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:47.770\nYou also learn more about the ASAs,\nas well as what the routers do in terms of\n\n367\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.240\nsecurity, if you go on toward\nthe CCNA security show as well.\n\n368\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.740\nSo there's actually chances and\n\n369\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.330\nopportunities for you to learn about\nhow these devices really do function.\n\n370\n00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.110\nBut at least from this standpoint here,\n\n371\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.940\ndon't be surprised as you run across\nthese different networking components.\n\n372\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.990\nNow Cisco, has a complete market on\nwhatever company you work for right now,\n\n373\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.950\nor you end up working for them in the\nfuture, this lines up exactly with them.\n\n374\n00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.956\nBut you may find that they'll be different\nbrands wherever the company that you\n\n375\n00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:17.503\nwork for.\n\n376\n00:21:17.503 --> 00:21:21.432\nSo for example, I'm right here at ITProTV,\nwe have, I hate to say it,\n\n377\n00:21:21.432 --> 00:21:22.882\nwe have Juniper routers.\n\n378\n00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:23.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n379\n00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:27.537\nthen our firewall is actually a PSS\nfirewall, our switch is an HP switch.\n\n380\n00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:31.503\n&gt;&gt; Cisco people are going, no [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:21:31.503 --> 00:21:37.328\n&gt;&gt; But it's the reality, right,\nnot every shop's gonna be 100% Cisco.\n\n382\n00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:40.950\nNow the ones that are, don't get me wrong,\nthose are great shops too.\n\n383\n00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.092\nBut the very fact is,\n\n384\n00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:45.780\nyou kind of at least understand\nwhat components are normally where.\n\n385\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.876\nIn an enterprise business, that's the key,\n\n386\n00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:50.790\nis understanding where these\nthings end up lining up.\n\n387\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.220\nSo don't be surprised on the exam,\nif they ask you about the functionality or\n\n388\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.850\nwhere do you tend to\nplace these devices here?\n\n389\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.430\nNow I do have to warn, cuz I mentioned\nthat we're talking about enterprise.\n\n390\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:06.090\nBut in small businesses,\nI know that at one point, okay,\n\n391\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:11.590\nin a smaller company that I did some\nsupport for, they didn't have anything but\n\n392\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.410\nan ASA that directly connected\nthem out to the Internet, okay?\n\n393\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.770\nSo in other words, because the ASA can\nalso do routing, it's just really basic.\n\n394\n00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.150\nSo they didn't even have\na router in their place,\n\n395\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.060\nthey just had an ASA\nthat actually did that.\n\n396\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.280\nSo that's fine too, but\nusually those are smaller shops.\n\n397\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.050\nIf you have a big shop where\nthere's actually gonna be\n\n398\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.320\nmultiple networks that are also assigned,\na router's probably the best way.\n\n399\n00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.160\nAnd then an ASA at each one\nof those different networks.\n\n400\n00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.400\n&gt;&gt; When I worked for a large insurance\ncompany, we had satellite offices, and\n\n401\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.000\nthat's what we did.\n\n402\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.405\nWe just put ASAs in the satellite offices,\nwe didn't have routers dedicated.\n\n403\n00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nsmall branch offices, essentially-\n\n404\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.964\n&gt;&gt; Work great.\n\n405\n00:22:48.964 --> 00:22:49.722\n&gt;&gt; They work great.\n\n406\n00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:52.837\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we just used it to connect to\nthe VPN concentrator, made a VPN tunnel,\n\n407\n00:22:52.837 --> 00:22:54.610\neverything was fine, it was wonderful.\n\n408\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.006\n&gt;&gt; And that's essentially what you end\nup doing pretty much in reality, so\n\n409\n00:22:58.006 --> 00:22:59.830\npay attention to these components.\n\n410\n00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.490\nLearn a little more about each of them,\nand then you can jump into your\n\n411\n00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.790\nown melee of which device actually goes\nwhere in terms of security devices.\n\n412\n00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.500\nYou'll always have arguments for\nboth sides,\n\n413\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.450\nI always thought, no, this is\nthe only way you that should do this,\n\n414\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.850\nbut people do make strong arguments for\nthe other way.\n\n415\n00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.200\nI'm still not convinced by them,\nbut they do make strong arguments.\n\n416\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.584\nBut Daniel, that should give us a nice at\nleast overview of some of the components\n\n417\n00:23:25.584 --> 00:23:29.600\nthat most people at least at the CCNT\nlevel, they're gonna encounter.\n\n418\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.670\nThey probably won't configure the ASA or\n\n419\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.130\nthey won't configure the IPS,\nyou'll know at least what it does.\n\n420\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Ronnie,\ngreat job of describing those things.\n\n421\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.918\nSo if you were unfamiliar with them,\nhopefully that has been remedied.\n\n422\n00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:43.750\nIf you were familiar with them,\n\n423\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.730\nmaybe you know a little more about\nthem than you did when you started.\n\n424\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.940\nAnd that's the whole purpose of this show,\n\n425\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.630\njust to make sure you know everything\nyou need to know to pass the exam.\n\n426\n00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.400\nAnd to be familiar with these things\ninside of your own environments.\n\n427\n00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.650\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today,\nalways a pleasure to have you on the show.\n\n428\n00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.130\nAlways a pleasure to have you guys\nout there watching as well, but\n\n429\n00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.340\nit is that time for us to sign off.\n\n430\n00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.850\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n431\n00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n432\n00:24:03.810

It's going great, Daniel,\nthank you once again for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.310\nToday, we're talking, I hate to say word,\n\n14\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.950\nwe're talking more basic in\nnetworking fundamentals here.\n\n15\n00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.211\nWell we're moving onto take a look\nat some of the different network\n\n16\n00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.856\ntopologies that you're likely to\nencounter in an enterprise network,\n\n17\n00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:52.234\nis what we end up seeing here, okay.\n\n18\n00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:55.351\nSo it's not the most\ngigantic topic in the world,\n\n19\n00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.370\nthere's really not a ton of detail\nin what we need to talk about.\n\n20\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.069\nBut you do need to understand what's\ngoing on especially if you don't have any\n\n21\n00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.200\nreal background knowledge\nin networking and\n\n22\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.300\nwhy devises are actually\nconnected together, right.\n\n23\n00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.810\nSo that's where we want to focus in on,\nokay.\n\n24\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.965\nSo, Daniel, when we start taking\na look at the idea of topologies here,\n\n25\n00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:19.950\nokay, well the hard part is people\ndon't know why we need them, okay, so\n\n26\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.980\nyou'll see that there's three of them\nup on my screen right here, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.440\nAnd the reason why we need\nthese types of topologies\n\n28\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.070\nis because you don't exactly understand\nwhat happens with a bad topology\n\n29\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.610\nuntil you've actually implemented\na bad topology, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.265\nSo, let me kind of give you an example\nhere of what can happen in a bad topology.\n\n31\n00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:46.200\nSo,well at least I think I can here,\nlet me pull open my trusty In and\n\n32\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.420\nI'll grab a,\nactually we'll do it this way so\n\n33\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780\nI don't have to worry about moving\naround all that stuff here, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.395\nI'll just take one of these switches here\nand I'll make a couple of duplicates for\n\n35\n00:01:56.395 --> 00:02:00.980\nus, right here at the top of the screen,\nall right.\n\n36\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.190\nSo Daniel, if I were beginning in\nnetworking and I had three different rooms\n\n37\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.155\nthat I wanted to network together,\nokay, so let's say that here it is,\n\n38\n00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:16.160\nhere's three different switches one switch\none switch for each room, makes sense.\n\n39\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.290\n&gt;&gt; Looks good.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, looks great so the way that I\n\n40\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.160\nstart forming this topology here is\nI go ahead and I connect this switch.\n\n41\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.355\nAnd then I connect this switch.\n\n42\n00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:32.754\nTo this switch right here, okay,\n\n43\n00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:37.305\nthat looks good I don't see\nanything wrong with that, okay, but\n\n44\n00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:42.130\nlet's say that we also then put\na router to get out into the Internet.\n\n45\n00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.000\nRight over here.\n\n46\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.978\nAll right so on the fly my weak coloring\nthen drawing here as we start doing it, so\n\n47\n00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:56.910\nthat connects out to\nthe Internet that router.\n\n48\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that looks good right?\n\n49\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah fine.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n50\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.720\nlet's say that each one of these\nswitches has 40 ports in it.\n\n51\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n52\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.590\nwe've got now 40 students in\neach particular classroom.\n\n53\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it like that\n\n54\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.410\nall right, make sense?\n\n55\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.060\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n56\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhat happens now if let's say that for\n\n57\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.160\nexample here that I do something silly.\n\n58\n00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.680\nIf I can actually get something here.\n\n59\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.337\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's gonna do his\ncable [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now\n&gt;&gt; I break this wire, I disconnect it.\n\n61\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.365\nOkay, so if I cut the wire right there,\n\n62\n00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:36.600\nDaniel\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n63\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what's gonna happen to the people\nin the second and third classroom?\n\n64\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey'll be able to talk to each other but\n\n65\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.160\nthat Internet access has gone bye-bye.\n\n66\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and let's say that one of\nthe servers that everybody accesses\n\n67\n00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.830\ncuz Ronnie was unusually smart.\n\n68\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Foolish [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah foolish in this way,\n\n69\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.720\nlet's say that the server for\n\n70\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.470\nall the files that they need to\naccess on all three classrooms,\n\n71\n00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:09.295\nResides off of this switch, how much\nwork are they gonna get done, Daniel?\n\n72\n00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.328\n&gt;&gt; It's in the same bucket\nas that Internet connection.\n\n73\n00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:11.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:12.505\n&gt;&gt; Bye bye.\n\n75\n00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:14.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a bad topology.\n\n76\n00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's bad.\n&gt;&gt; If you don't think about it, right, and\n\n77\n00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:21.055\nyou go, we'll just connect these things\nall together the consequences to them,\n\n78\n00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:24.415\nthey're not necessarily always\nimmediate until somebody goes, I can't-\n\n79\n00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:25.535\n&gt;&gt; They can be devastating.\n\n80\n00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:28.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they can be devastating\nespecially when two-thirds of your\n\n81\n00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:32.490\nstudents are going, I can't get access\nto that, I can't get access to Internet,\n\n82\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.150\nmy job requires it, or work requires it,\nif we're talking about students, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.470\nSo that's why we wanna talk about\nthe idea of topologies and what they\n\n84\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.650\ncan actually do for us and why we also\nneed better topologies to help us out.\n\n85\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.060\nSo, you have to consider the idea of\nnetworking topology as being one of\n\n86\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.990\nthe things especially if you're told,\nwe need you to wire this place up, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.660\nWell how do you choose to do that, okay,\n\n88\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.540\nand what do you actually need\nto understand to do this?\n\n89\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.060\nWell this is wiring everything up,\nDan, okay\n\n90\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.350\nright here across the top of the screen,\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n91\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.860\n&gt;&gt; It wired everything up the problem is\n\n92\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.615\nit didn't really fit the needs that we\nhave so most of the time the reason and\n\n93\n00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.545\nthe way that you develop a topology\nis you do it based on need.\n\n94\n00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:23.426\nBut you also do it based on the fact of,\nwell, what is actually where and\n\n95\n00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:27.905\nwhy do we actually want something like\nthis to help us out, okay, so that's why.\n\n96\n00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:32.955\nBad topologies exist, so\nthat means that we have to actually\n\n97\n00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:39.270\nbe able to use our understanding\nof good topologies to help us out.\n\n98\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.046\nNow for the exam itself,\nthere's more topologies then this by far.\n\n99\n00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:44.577\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but for the exam itself it\nspecifically calls out these three,\n\n101\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.500\nthere are older topologies like a bus\ntopology where everybody's actually\n\n102\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.690\nall connected to one-\n&gt;&gt; One line.\n\n103\n00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.022\n&gt;&gt; One line and the worst thing about that\none line is if you cut the line anywhere,\n\n104\n00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:02.440\nlike even at the end of the line,\nit would just blow the entire network up.\n\n105\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.440\nSo even if you didn't actually cut it off\nin between like I did you could actually\n\n106\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.380\nblow the whole thing up but we wanna\ntalk about these three topologies and\n\n107\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.280\nwhat they help us to be able to do, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.300\nSo, when we start to take a look at them,\nokay, and\n\n109\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.100\nthe idea of these topologies let's start\noff with by far the most common one that\n\n110\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.380\nmore than likely we're gonna see.\n\n111\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.670\nSo even working the branch office or\ninside of an enterprise LAN here,\n\n112\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.430\nit's gonna be this one over\nhere on the left, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.200\nYou and\nI as far as direct user access goes,\n\n114\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.210\nthis is the type of topology\nthat we'll end up seeing.\n\n115\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.970\nSo for example,\n\n116\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.950\neven though I have these switches\nconnected, notice Daniel this is different\n\n117\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.150\nthan the way that I actually had the\nswitches connected right up at the top.\n\n118\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.880\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n119\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.050\nremember where I had them just kind\nof strung along in one sense here,\n\n120\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.560\nnow I have them all connected to\na centralized device and step, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.950\nSo, in this one if we kind of do the same\nthing, let's do it this way, here,\n\n122\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.620\nsee if I can make a copy again and\npaste it and I just put,\n\n123\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.750\nlet's say the router here in the center.\n\n124\n00:07:10.143 --> 00:07:14.720\nLike this, all right so Daniel,\nif I take out only one of these guys.\n\n125\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.140\nLet's say this one gets cut, okay.\n\n126\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.710\n&gt;&gt; Gone.\n\n127\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gone and it has a bad day,\nbut what about everybody else?\n\n128\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.580\n&gt;&gt; Everybody else is sailing.\n\n129\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the other students really\ndon't have very many problems here and\n\n130\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.950\nthen let's say that everybody's\nactually connected to every port in\n\n131\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.730\nthis switch too.\n\n132\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n133\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.240\nevery single computer's\nactually connect to the zone.\n\n134\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.620\nWe pull out one wire,\ndoes it affect the rest of the classroom?\n\n135\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.130\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n136\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.050\n&gt;&gt; Not really, so here, we isolate\ndamage that ends up happening so\n\n137\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.490\nthis is by far the one that's\nmost commonly used in labs.\n\n138\n00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.630\nEvery single wall port that you\nend up seeing in most buildings,\n\n139\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.830\nthey're running this topology they're\nall connecting back through the walls,\n\n140\n00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.330\nultimately ending up in a switch\nsomewhere with its own connection.\n\n141\n00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.850\nSo it's not dependent on\nanother connection to do this,\n\n142\n00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.400\nthe other thing that this actually affords\nus, right, is if we do the same thing and\n\n143\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.770\nwe also add in that\nserver To the same place.\n\n144\n00:08:17.928 --> 00:08:20.149\nNotice that it doesn't\naffect everybody else too,\n\n145\n00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:22.792\nunlike the bad topology that we\nhad at the beginning, right.\n\n146\n00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:27.490\nSo, if I add that same server to that\ncentralized switch so even if we\n\n147\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.590\nactually disconnect the same line here,\nthis guy is still having a problem but\n\n148\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.230\neverybody else can still gain access\nto the resources on the server as well.\n\n149\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.880\nSo you can see why the star\ntopology is actually very helpful.\n\n150\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you look at your previous\nexample that Ronnie kind of drew up on\n\n151\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.701\nthe fly where we had two-thirds loss.\n\n152\n00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n153\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Of connectivity, here we've dropped it\ndown, let's readjust for just a second,\n\n154\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.730\nlet's say there's three connections\ninstead of four, going with those thirds.\n\n155\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You're down to one\n\n156\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.250\nthird loss instead of two thirds, that's\na big decrease in connectivity issues,\n\n157\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.225\nmakes your job a whole lot easier\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting and\n\n158\n00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:04.910\ngetting things back in\naction a lot of good stuff.\n\n159\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, so for end users and for\n\n160\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.560\nLAN environments, this is probably\nwhat you'll end up seeing, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.320\nNow the problem that we have though,\nDaniel,\n\n162\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.740\nalong with this, okay,\nis still the fact that there is\n\n163\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.850\none connection here to let's just say\nthe resources at this point, okay.\n\n164\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:27.180\nSo Daniel, what happens then if I lose\nthat connection to just the server now?\n\n165\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Now you're having more of a bad day.\n\n166\n00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.660\n&gt;&gt; Now there's actually a really bad day.\n\n167\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.810\n&gt;&gt; Still not as difficult to troubleshoot,\n\n168\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.200\nit's probably about the same when it\ncomes to, if that connection is gone,\n\n169\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.500\nyou have to re-establish that connection\nand then everyone will be back.\n\n170\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's good on that hand,\n\n171\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.600\nbut that resource only had one connection,\nwe like redundancy, right?\n\n172\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, we like redundancy and that's\nwhat the other two offer us, to a point.\n\n173\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.120\nNow if I wanted full redundancy,\nokay, instead,\n\n174\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.060\nyou actually see what we call\nthis mesh topology here,\n\n175\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.180\nthat allows me to take this one server and\nmake multiple connections to it.\n\n176\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.630\nNow I connected it to other servers over\nhere, which is fine but, in this instance,\n\n177\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.303\nhere, okay,\nof the way that I have it, Daniel,\n\n178\n00:10:10.303 --> 00:10:13.105\nwhat happens now if I actually\ndo something like this?\n\n179\n00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:15.420\nSo, I actually run connections.\n\n180\n00:10:16.428 --> 00:10:19.180\nBetween well all the other switches.\n\n181\n00:10:21.862 --> 00:10:28.354\nSo now Daniel, if we do that, And\n\n182\n00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:33.700\nbreak in any one line to the server, are\nwe good or are we now it's still toast?\n\n183\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.940\n&gt;&gt; No,\nno we're good at this point because,\n\n184\n00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.560\njust because one line broke doesn't mean\nthat we're out in, that we're out, right.\n\n185\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We've got plenty of backup redundant\n\n186\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.290\nlines that any of the other devices\nthat need to make a connection to it\n\n187\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.830\ncould follow to make it there.\n\n188\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.275\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when we need redundancy\nsuch as an essential server,\n\n189\n00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:57.345\na database server, something that's\nessentially needed every day.\n\n190\n00:10:57.345 --> 00:10:59.273\n&gt;&gt; Log on server, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're right,\n\n191\n00:10:59.273 --> 00:11:03.275\nyeah, domain controller,\nwhatever it might be, right.\n\n192\n00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:06.366\nAs you need those, setting them\nup in redundancy and making sure\n\n193\n00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:10.530\nthat you have connections and pathways\nto get there is actually gonna be key.\n\n194\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.206\nNow the other thing, of course,\nthat you can do in today's world, right,\n\n195\n00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:17.710\nis actually set up redundancy between\nthese devices that way you cluster\n\n196\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.770\nthem together and it doesn't\nmatter which one you connect to.\n\n197\n00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.584\nIt'll actually allow them\nto work regardless but\n\n198\n00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:26.070\neven if you actually\nbreak one of these out.\n\n199\n00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.896\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, there is a bit of a, you\ndon't get anything for free and in this,\n\n200\n00:11:29.896 --> 00:11:32.550\nit's a real sense of not\ngetting something for free.\n\n201\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we've increased the amount of\n\n202\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.580\nconnections and that means now every\ntime I add a new device if I want that\n\n203\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.800\nfull mesh topology,\nI have to add all those new connections.\n\n204\n00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.140\nSo, it's exponentially large\nwhen it comes to cost and\n\n205\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.295\nsize as I need to add these connections,\nam I correct on that?\n\n206\n00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:51.458\n&gt;&gt; You are absolutely correct and\nthere is a formula you have to know-\n\n207\n00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:52.497\n&gt;&gt; Look at that [LAUGH].\n\n208\n00:11:52.497 --> 00:11:55.922\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go figure, okay, so\nwhen we start taking a look this formula,\n\n209\n00:11:55.922 --> 00:11:59.865\nyes you want to know this if you're\non a meshed topologe here, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:01.355\nSo if you're actually in the mesh and\n\n211\n00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:04.815\nyou need to find out how many\nconnections that you need, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:08.210\nN is actually going to equal\nthe number of nodes, okay,\n\n213\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.270\nthe number of nodes, and nodes of course\nare the devices that we are connecting.\n\n214\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.380\nSo, let's make sure that we count\nthis up right, and understand, okay.\n\n215\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:24.354\nSo, in here for us is, let's say 4,\nso we take 4 times 4 minus 1,\n\n216\n00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:29.607\nright, which is gonna be 4 times 3,\nif my math is correct,\n\n217\n00:12:29.607 --> 00:12:33.420\nand that should be 12 altogether, okay.\n\n218\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:39.922\nSo each one of these nodes, right,\nactually needs three connections,\n\n219\n00:12:39.922 --> 00:12:44.715\nright, so 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3,\n\n220\n00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:49.830\n1, 2, 3, okay, so\nif we change this number though,\n\n221\n00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:55.060\nlet's say for example,\nto 10 instead, right.\n\n222\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.990\nSo, 10,\noops why can't I type in the number 10?\n\n223\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.698\nThat's silly, 10 times 10 minus 1, oops,\n\n224\n00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:07.150\nyeah that worked out real well, Ronnie.\n\n225\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.690\nThat was terrible, okay, so if we were\ndoing that map something like this, right,\n\n226\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.110\nif I was told hey I wanna do\na full mesh topology Daniel and\n\n227\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:19.890\nI have 10 nodes okay,\nhow many connections would I need to have?\n\n228\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.330\nWell this is the formula that you need\nto make sure that you know, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.760\n10 times 10, or 10 times 10 minus 1, okay.\n\n230\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.428\nThat would give us 90 connections\nthere for those ten nodes.\n\n231\n00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:37.010\n&gt;&gt; Now, even though we have a connection\nall ready, so we're saying we need one, so\n\n232\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.640\nfor our four boxes here, our four servers,\n\n233\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.516\nwe would need one connection for each\none of the nodes that's connected to it.\n\n234\n00:13:43.516 --> 00:13:48.620\nSo, 1, 2, 3 since there's already\na node connection made from the first\n\n235\n00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.350\ntime you make a connection, do you have to\nmake that redundant connection as well?\n\n236\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.980\nBecause I've seen this formula before,\nI've also seen with a divided by two.\n\n237\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.140\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, it depends at least, for\n\n238\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.180\nCisco LAN this is the way I would go\nunless, I may have to actually look that\n\n239\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.500\none up again just in case but normally\nwhat you actually see is this, like this.\n\n240\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.670\nNow if you do see it, so let me make sure\nI put that down cuz I may be wrong on this\n\n241\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:18.874\none, may not be remembering here or\nit may be the other one which is N times\n\n242\n00:14:18.874 --> 00:14:23.680\nN minus 1 and divided by 2.\n\n243\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.160\nSo, if we divide it by 2 that would\nactually work as well, which would give\n\n244\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.220\nyou on the 10 that would be 90, that would\nbe 45, so I think Daniel you may be right,\n\n245\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.760\nand I may be wrong here,\nnow that I'm starting to count here.\n\n246\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Not that you couldn't do it the way you\nwere talking about, you totally could and\n\n247\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.350\nthat would be super redundancy\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super redundancy, okay, so\n\n248\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.800\nyou are correct, Daniel, cuz it's just my\nbrain not remembering everything, okay.\n\n249\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.690\nSo let's do it that way instead, so on\nthis one, if we did that, that would be,\n\n250\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.773\nwhat, for a 4 here, 4,\n12, 6, 6 connections.\n\n251\n00:14:54.773 --> 00:14:55.920\n&gt;&gt; Six connections.\n\n252\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, okay,\nso that's the other one.\n\n253\n00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.070\nSo that was just me trying to, and\n\n254\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.830\nI didn't remember the other\nhalf of the formula happens.\n\n255\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.960\n&gt;&gt; But if you add another server here.\n\n256\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.300\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that would be-\n\n257\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.500\n&gt;&gt; You have to continue.\n\n258\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.860\n&gt;&gt; 5 times 5, minus 1,\nwhich would be 4 times 5,\n\n259\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.790\nwhich is 45-\n&gt;&gt; 20, yeah.\n\n260\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:17.485\n&gt;&gt; Divided by 2, which is 22 something so\nyou go from, it gets crazy.\n\n261\n00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:20.985\n&gt;&gt; It does, yeah, so when you start\ndoing that, so that'd be 5 times 4-\n\n262\n00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:22.555\n&gt;&gt; You see how core starts to grow, yeah.\n\n263\n00:15:22.555 --> 00:15:26.119\n&gt;&gt; That's 20, yeah, you start to do that\nso just be aware when you start seeing\n\n264\n00:15:26.119 --> 00:15:29.435\nstuff like that, it will end up happening,\nlet me take that away.\n\n265\n00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:31.802\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nfive times four is 20, not 40.\n\n266\n00:15:31.802 --> 00:15:33.539\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm an idiot [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:35.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My math is horrible.\n\n268\n00:15:35.043 --> 00:15:39.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me use that formula\ninstead cuz now that you say it,\n\n269\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.390\nnow that we worked it out, I'm absolutely\nsure that I am wrong on this step.\n\n270\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.240\nThat was too many connections, so\nwe'll use that one right there, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.770\nThe other possibility of course is what we\ncall a hybrid, now, notice that when you\n\n272\n00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:57.450\nstart taking a look at, some of these\ndevices actually have all three, right.\n\n273\n00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.040\nSo, this one here is\nconnected to three and\n\n274\n00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.410\nthis one here is connected to three but\nsome devices may only be connected to two.\n\n275\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.630\nSo, these here on this side notice\nit's not a full mesh at this point so\n\n276\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:14.610\nit could be where you have some devices\nthat are 1, 2, 3, are connected.\n\n277\n00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.740\nNotice this one only has two connections,\nthis one has three,\n\n278\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.250\nthis one also has two and that is because\nyou may actually find out that for\n\n279\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.660\ncost savings more than anything else.\n\n280\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.160\nThat certain elements do need to have the\nprotection of the mesh to make sure that\n\n281\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.380\nwe can actually do everything that we\nwant to but other ones, like the idea of\n\n282\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:39.020\nN devices here, being connected\nmay not need something like this.\n\n283\n00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.950\nSo you may actually\nchoose instead to go hey,\n\n284\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.390\nwhat we can do is we can just,\ndo just well,\n\n285\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.190\nless than the full mesh topology on some\nof them helping to save the number of\n\n286\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.610\nconnection that you need as well,\n&gt;&gt; All right yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.480\n&gt;&gt; So all those, yeah.\n\n288\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.960\n&gt;&gt; I totally agree, you're getting kind of\nthe best of both worlds when you come to\n\n289\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:59.040\nhybrid, right, you got some redundancy but\nyou also have some cost savings as well.\n\n290\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.800\nAnd if it's not super missions critical,\n\n291\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.390\nit's probably the way\nin which you wanna go.\n\n292\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really helps, because there's\nnot everything in your network needs full\n\n293\n00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:10.830\nredundancy, so end user devices don't\nnecessarily need full redundancy\n\n294\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.300\nthose are things that you don't\nnormally have to worry about.\n\n295\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.280\nBut things like critical servers, you may\nwant to put that on those links that do\n\n296\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.790\nneed full redundancy and even your core\nnetwork infrastructure that you have, you\n\n297\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.180\nmay want to make sure that those things\nare actually on full redundancy as well.\n\n298\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.360\nSo all that is actually very important for\n\n299\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.660\nsome of the things that we need here but\ntaking a look at those topologies and\n\n300\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.750\nunderstanding what you have there,\nthat's kind of the key.\n\n301\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.500\nSo making sure that you can select one or\nthe other, that's what you want to\n\n302\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.670\nmake sure that you do and choose the right\none for the environment that you have.\n\n303\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:48.280\nSo one of them has cost savings,\none of them has many more connections and\n\n304\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.290\nthe other one of course is\nkind of the balance of both.\n\n305\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:56.770\nBut redundancy versus connectivity versus\nthe idea of savings, it's all wrapped up\n\n306\n00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.860\nin learning about these three specifically\nfor whatever is coming up for your exam.\n\n307\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.990\nThe great thing is this is not the hardest\npart of the exam that you'll ever face,\n\n308\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.690\nbut it does just take you\na little bit of time.\n\n309\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:12.180\nMake sure you glance over it and have\nthis well in your mind as you start to\n\n310\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.685\ndo a little bit more especially\nin planning if you need to.\n\n311\n00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Well great stuff Ronnie thanks for\n\n312\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:21.100\nfamiliarizing us with the topologies that\nwe will need to be well familiar with\n\n313\n00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.630\nwhen it comes to the exam so make sure\nyou get that squared away in mind.\n\n314\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.750\nCuz it can be a little tricky you\ngot to remember which ones which and\n\n315\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.278\nhow they kind of work cuz you\nmight some questions about,\n\n316\n00:18:29.278 --> 00:18:33.490\nkind of what Ronnie's scenario\nwhat happens if I cut this cable,\n\n317\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.340\nwe lose connection to this device,\nwhat happens?\n\n318\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.350\nWhere does the trouble shooting go?\n\n319\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.200\nSo you gotta be on lock solid when\nit comes to those topologies.\n\n320\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.530\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today,\nwe appreciate your time as always, and\n\n321\n00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.550\nwe appreciate you good folks out there for\nwatching, but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n322\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.210\ncall it a day.\n\n323\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.820\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n324\n00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n325\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.500\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n326\n00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:59.250\n[MUSIC]\n\n327\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.070\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.645\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n4\n00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.580\ngreetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.670\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.390\nwe're back with more in our CCENT series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.822\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend and mentor, Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:25.680\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.910\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.908\nLike the dramatic?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that was very nice an intro,\n\n11\n00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:31.439\nthat's right [CROSSTALK].\n\n12\n00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.260\nThat sounds ominous rather than-\n&gt;&gt; Dun-dun-dun.\n\n13\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.830\n&gt;&gt; The idea of actually somebody\n\n14\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.180\nhelping you, it sounds like somebody\ntrying to overlord and beat you down.\n\n15\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.878\nBut we're not here to do that, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:43.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not here to do that.\n\n17\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.434\nMaybe Daniel thinks I am, but\nwe are today taking a look at-\n\n18\n00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:46.979\n&gt;&gt; Just don't hit me again, Ron.\n\n19\n00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.638\n&gt;&gt; I won't hit you.\n\n20\n00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:54.190\nI do have a cat 5 cable, so\nyou're off, there you go.\n\n21\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.850\nWe will be taking a look today at the idea\nof enterprise networking architecture.\n\n22\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.450\nNow, Daniel,\nthat sounds like a whole truckload of fun,\n\n23\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.125\ndoesn't it?\n&gt;&gt; You said words.\n\n24\n00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:04.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.000\n&gt;&gt; I assume they have English\n\n26\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.825\nmeanings to them.\n\n27\n00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:08.779\n[LAUGH] We should string that together and\n\n28\n00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:12.231\nprobably break it down a little better?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, the very\n\n29\n00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:16.700\nfact is there's a few things that Cisco\nspecifically wants you to know about.\n\n30\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.490\nAnd the reason why it starts to go into\nthe realm of designing networks, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.960\nAnd it's very important that we understand\nthe idea of network design a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.200\nBecause what we start to\nactually learn is that\n\n33\n00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.320\npeople will of course just get components\nand tried to string them together.\n\n34\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.240\nAnd they don't work as well as we\nthink that they were going to work and\n\n35\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.520\nwe took a look at something like this when\nwe talked about networking topologies.\n\n36\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.320\nAnd when you have a bad network topology,\n\n37\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.880\nit normally indicates\na bad network design.\n\n38\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.520\nAnd the reason why that's important is\nbecause the failure of any one link or\n\n39\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.690\nany one device.\n\n40\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.850\nAnd take out more than what we expected\nto and that's where the issues begin.\n\n41\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.300\nIs when we don't know why an outage\nactually occurred or why something didn't\n\n42\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.870\nwork the way that it needed to\nwhen we have everything in place.\n\n43\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.570\nMost of the time,\n\n44\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.400\nit comes back to the idea of design\nwhen people aren't paying attention.\n\n45\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.860\nNow, I found this out the hard way,\nDaniel, which is not through networking,\n\n46\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.390\nbut through learning about databases.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n47\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Now a lot of times when I\n\n48\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.340\nstarted teaching the basic database\ncourses like Access and stuff like that.\n\n49\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.110\nMost of the time, when people\nwould bring in an Access database,\n\n50\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.700\nI don't know why it won't give me\nthe query results that I'm looking for.\n\n51\n00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.702\nI don't know why I can't run this report\nthe way that I wanted it to do and\n\n52\n00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:37.125\nyou look at it and\nit comes back bad design.\n\n53\n00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:41.550\nA lot of the networking stuff that we\ndo can also come back to that as well.\n\n54\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.028\nSo the problem that we have though in\ntoday's world, in today's networks,\n\n55\n00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:46.190\nis simple.\n\n56\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.320\nNo one solid model by itself\ncan actually cover everything.\n\n57\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.700\nAnd that's because every\nnetwork is different, right?\n\n58\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.600\nSo networks end up developing over\ntime rather than just saying, right,\n\n59\n00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.110\nhere's the network we're gonna build and\nthat's gonna stay the way that needs to\n\n60\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.315\nforever and ever and ever.\n\n61\n00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:04.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n62\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.470\nBut there are core principles, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.670\nThat we can learn from,\n\n64\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.810\nespecially from Cisco, that will\nhelp us out when we start doing it.\n\n65\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.720\nSo we can't just take that idea of going,\nall right, so, Daniel says I bought\n\n66\n00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.800\nthis gigantic router, and I bought five of\nthese switches, Ronnie, just make it work.\n\n67\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.660\nAnd if I don't have any clue of how\nthat's supposed to happen, I go okay,\n\n68\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.170\nI guess these switches\nconnect together somehow and\n\n69\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.970\na router is used for\nconnecting through something.\n\n70\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.460\nSo we'll just kind of cable them\ntogether and Hope for the best.\n\n71\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.100\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan,\n\n72\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.000\nRonnie.\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a plan, but\n\n73\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.240\nit's a bad plan [LAUGH].\n\n74\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.410\nIt's a terribly bad plan\n\n75\n00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.900\nbecause you can lead to things like loops,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n76\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.280\n&gt;&gt; That we don't think about\n\n77\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.550\nswitching loops, which are really bad.\n\n78\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.140\nIt can also of course lead to non\nconnectivity on certain things.\n\n79\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.950\nYou won't be able to reach certain\ntypes of resource that you need to.\n\n80\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.540\nSo the ideas of the show\nthat we just completed,\n\n81\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.590\nif you're watching it in the series,\nthe topology.\n\n82\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.150\nAs well as the show that\nwe're doing right now,\n\n83\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.920\nin design, is going to really matter.\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\n\n84\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.300\nthis is really about trying to build\na robust network from the ground up.\n\n85\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.460\nAnd going this is the best way to do this,\nso\n\n86\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.400\nthat we have minimal downtime\nif something does happen.\n\n87\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.360\nEverything doesn't go down,\nonly certain parts go down.\n\n88\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.110\nMinimizing and\n\n89\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.290\nmitigating any kind of downtime.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n90\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.000\nthat's a great way to look at it right?\n\n91\n00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.220\nFrom the technical perspective that you\nand I are managing systems like this,\n\n92\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.460\nit really about is trying to go all right,\nif we have worst case scenarios, right?\n\n93\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.810\nIf we have that worst case scenario,\n\n94\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.320\nhow can I minimize the impact\nof something going down?\n\n95\n00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.760\nSo you can always look at it\nfrom that standpoint as well.\n\n96\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.260\nBut what about from\nthe perspective from growth?\n\n97\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.650\nWhat about from the perspective\nof actually building the network?\n\n98\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.140\nThe key term that we want\nto always implement and\n\n99\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.690\nalways want to actually think about\nIs what we call the term scalability.\n\n100\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.690\nSo Daniel, I've just thrown that\ngigantic word out there, scalability.\n\n101\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Scalability.\n\n102\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.540\n&gt;&gt; And that sounds like\n\n103\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.777\na rash of some sort that I have.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n104\n00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:01.014\n&gt;&gt; But it's not about some.\n\n105\n00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:02.418\n&gt;&gt; It's a type of Sanskrit, but\n\n106\n00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.105\nI think it contagious.\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n\n107\n00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:04.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.050\n&gt;&gt; So it's about the idea of scalability.\n\n109\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.430\nNow if you're new to networking,\nthe idea of scalability and networking,\n\n110\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.680\nthat doesn't sound you're probably\nlike what does that actually mean?\n\n111\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.630\nThe problem that we have when we\ntake a look at networking is we go\n\n112\n00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.280\nalright here's the network model\nthat we're going to follow and\n\n113\n00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.860\nhere's what we're going to stay.\n\n114\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.730\nWhat happens then is your business grows.\n\n115\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.750\nThat switch that Daniel bought,\nhe says yeah,\n\n116\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.620\nthis 12 port switch is going\nto last us for five years.\n\n117\n00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.930\nA year later Daniel we've\nhired 30 more people.\n\n118\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.150\nAnd now Daniel,\nwhat about your 12 port switch?\n\n119\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Man, them hubs start coming out, right?\n\n120\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.810\nThat's how we roll [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n121\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.970\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that.\n\n122\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do that.\n\n123\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.400\nBut those are the problems.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, is that\n\n125\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.890\nwe don't design it in a scalable fashion.\n\n126\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.480\nAnd there was one that\ncan handle the capacity\n\n127\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.600\nin just a sheer number of things\nthat we can add into the network.\n\n128\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.730\nAnd that's gonna happen.\n\n129\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.650\nYour network is gonna grow in your\nbusiness as you start to add in.\n\n130\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.200\nNone of us ever think it does, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.680\nNone of us do that.\n\n132\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.417\nSo for example, Daniel, even right here\nat ITProTV when we decided to move\n\n133\n00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:14.247\ninto [INAUDIBLE], we got this nice\nswitch that had 192 ports on it, okay.\n\n134\n00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:15.720\nAnd we didn't even-\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of ports.\n\n135\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.737\n&gt;&gt; We didn't even fill up\n\n136\n00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:19.210\nall the blades in that particular switch.\n\n137\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.210\nOnce we got over here and we got\neverything set up, we realized something.\n\n138\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.740\nWe need to add in that additional\n\n139\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.740\nnumber to get us all the way up to\nthe 224 max that we had needed.\n\n140\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.460\nBecause we had so many more devices\nthan what we had originally planned for.\n\n141\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.810\nWe just kind of thought well if we have\naround 100, then we'll have around 90 or\n\n142\n00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.620\nso that are extra, we'll be fine.\n\n143\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.750\nBut once we got over here and\nwe started plugging things and\n\n144\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.060\nand we started going hey,\nwe need to really grow.\n\n145\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.920\nThe great thing is we thought\nabout that if we needed to grow,\n\n146\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.440\nwe had the ability to\nexpand those things out.\n\n147\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.890\nSo it did give us that.\n\n148\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.960\nSo we planned for\nthat scalability a little bit.\n\n149\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.140\nSo in that sense, you always have to\nthink in those terms as well, okay?\n\n150\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.207\nScalability in terms of just the number.\n\n151\n00:07:02.207 --> 00:07:05.979\nThe other thing that can also of course,\nhappen is that we can also have where we\n\n152\n00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.570\nstart taking on more different\nfunctions than what we realize.\n\n153\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.480\nAnd it may be where the core networking\ncomponents that you have around you\n\n154\n00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.480\nare not designed to actually do some\nof the things that you wanted it to do.\n\n155\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.656\nSo now you're talking about scaling out.\n\n156\n00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:23.550\nDo you have all\nthe capabilities that you need?\n\n157\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.540\nSo when it takes a look as scalability,\ndesign must include scalability, or\n\n158\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.070\nscaling up in you network\nto [INAUDIBLE] capacity.\n\n159\n00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.340\nAnd then scaling out to handle all\nthe extra things that you need to happen.\n\n160\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.996\nEspecially if your business\ndevelops like it does.\n\n161\n00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:41.550\nSo we kind of didn't think about it\nback in 2013 when the idea of ITProTV\n\n162\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.230\ncame along.\n\n163\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.020\nWe said IT training,\nthat's all we're gonna do.\n\n164\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.314\nBut now we're starting to expand out and\nthere's OfficePro,\n\n165\n00:07:46.314 --> 00:07:49.441\nthere's gonna be DevPro, there's gonna be\nso many other things that are out there.\n\n166\n00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:53.057\nAnd we're like yeah, we probably\nshould have panned for stuff like,\n\n167\n00:07:53.057 --> 00:07:57.450\nbut it's sometimes it's just short in what\nyou're think's gonna happen It's always\n\n168\n00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.184\nabout scalability.\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, when you talk scaling up\n\n169\n00:08:00.184 --> 00:08:03.423\nversus scaling out, I just wanna make\nsure that I'm following along and\n\n170\n00:08:03.423 --> 00:08:06.352\nthat we're all on the same page,\ncuz I might not be.\n\n171\n00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:09.970\nScaling up, this is the idea of, yeah,\n\n172\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.680\nmaybe gigabit to my desktops\nisn't standardized right now, but\n\n173\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.080\nmaybe in three years it's standardized.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.010\n&gt;&gt; So I go ahead and\n\n175\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.400\nbuy those gigabit switches, so that when\nit comes time when that is standard,\n\n176\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.700\nI'm already in place, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, that is a great example, Daniel.\n\n177\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.552\nThe very fact of just plain capacity\nis what we think about here.\n\n178\n00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:31.630\nSo Daniel gave us a great example.\n\n179\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.480\nOr the bandwidth that we might\nactually be consuming at that point.\n\n180\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.420\nIt's saying, look, even though everybody\nis really using about 100 megabits we\n\n181\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.570\nrealize that the networking world\ninternally, we're gonna go to gigabit.\n\n182\n00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.120\nWell, do I just say, I'm just gonna\nbuy 100 megabit switches now or\n\n183\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.650\nwe'll go ahead and\njust buy the gigabit switches and\n\n184\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.040\nput that in as well as the cabling and\neverything else that we need.\n\n185\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.350\nSo that is planning for capacity.\n\n186\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.370\nThe idea of planning for capabilities,\nright, is also another thing.\n\n187\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.880\nIt might be where in the beginning you're\nonly saying, this is what we need.\n\n188\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.210\nBut I know that in the future I\ncan take what I have right now and\n\n189\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.840\nthat can become something else.\n\n190\n00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.237\nAnd then I can buy this other thing\nthat I need that will help us expand\n\n191\n00:09:09.237 --> 00:09:11.424\nthe capabilities that we need.\n&gt;&gt; So you buy the switch\n\n192\n00:09:11.424 --> 00:09:13.280\nthat has empty blades in it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n193\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.370\n&gt;&gt; And then when the time comes,\n\n194\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.910\nyou slap the new modules in and\n\n195\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.400\nbada bing you're off to the races.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n196\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.680\n&gt;&gt; You're capable.\n\n197\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.546\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n198\n00:09:19.546 --> 00:09:22.540\nSo capability and\ncapacity is always a key.\n\n199\n00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.150\nSo in Cisco world, how in the world do\nwe do something like this is the key.\n\n200\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.620\n&gt;&gt; We spend a lot of money.\n\n201\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.540\n&gt;&gt; You can and\n\n202\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.360\nyou will if you do exactly the way\nthat Cisco wants you to do.\n\n203\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.357\nThere is no way around this system.\n&gt;&gt; Only they're like Microsoft,\n\n204\n00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:39.022\nthey're on the exam, if it has anything\nto do with get more Cisco stuff,\n\n205\n00:09:39.022 --> 00:09:40.830\nthat's the right answer.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.436\n&gt;&gt; I would love to tell you that that may\n\n207\n00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:43.980\nnot be, but I can't.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n208\n00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.260\nright.\n&gt;&gt; The unusual thing, right?\n\n209\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.350\nDaniel and I, we've taken so\nmany exams over our past lives that\n\n210\n00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.550\nit's just the very fact is, you have\nto find that vendor specific exams.\n\n211\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.052\nUsually the right answer does have to do\nwith the very fact that it's like, hey,\n\n212\n00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:01.012\nwhich of these products\nwould you actually,\n\n213\n00:10:01.012 --> 00:10:03.299\nany of them that actually\nlooks like it costs money.\n\n214\n00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:05.060\nYeah, that's probably\ngonna be the right answer.\n\n215\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.433\nBecause it gives you the full\nfunctionality that you need.\n\n216\n00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:10.078\nSo they're not looking for\nyou to go, yeah,\n\n217\n00:10:10.078 --> 00:10:14.794\nthis is kind of the bare minimum that\nthey want you to about the full package.\n\n218\n00:10:14.794 --> 00:10:18.550\nBut the reality, most of the time on Cisco\nexams, it really is function-oriented,\n\n219\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.670\nwhich is nice.\n\n220\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.250\nDon't get me wrong, you will get questions\nabout, which of the following appliances\n\n221\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.815\nshould you have in place if you\nneed to do something like that?\n\n222\n00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:27.879\nAnd of course,\nit's never gonna be the low-end things,\n\n223\n00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:30.060\nit's always gonna be\nthe higher end thing as well.\n\n224\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.440\nSo let's take a look at the way that\nCisco really does like this idea and\n\n225\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.340\nhow they think that\nthe idea of expanding for\n\n226\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.790\ncapacity as well as\ncapability helps us out.\n\n227\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.130\nSo even if your network is small,\n\n228\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.920\nyou may make the choices like\nwhat Daniel said, right?\n\n229\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.590\nThe ones that actually have some\nexpandability to help us out In terms of\n\n230\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.470\nthe number of ports it might be, the idea\nof bandwidth capabilities on these\n\n231\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:02.270\ndevices as well as the capabilities\nto upgrade those devices as well.\n\n232\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.750\nSo in Cisco, they call this\nthe three tier architecture.\n\n233\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.660\nAnd you have a core, you have\na distribution layer, and then down here\n\n234\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.010\na little bit behind my head you have what\nwe call access switches as well, okay?\n\n235\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.170\nNow for most of our company,\nright, users that sit at regular\n\n236\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.750\ndesktop computers at this point, well,\nthey are going to be at this access layer.\n\n237\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.710\nSo here you see the desktops, and they're\nprobably gonna connect individually.\n\n238\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.520\nIn other words, these are probably\ngonna be the connections that are not\n\n239\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.640\ngoing to be duplicated for redundancy.\n\n240\n00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.050\nMost of the time individual workstations\naren't gonna be duplicated for redundancy.\n\n241\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.480\nThey're gonna connect to one of these\nswitches here across the bottom.\n\n242\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.290\nAnd it's here at this layer\n\n243\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.350\nthat you can actually apply a lot of\ndifferent control for your users.\n\n244\n00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.990\nAnd that's key and that's what I also\nput down here right, once again,\n\n245\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.840\nbehind my head here where it says,\nApply Network Access Policies, right?\n\n246\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.930\nSo if you know that you need\nyour users to be controlled,\n\n247\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.500\nthis is the layer that you\napply those policies in.\n\n248\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.370\nYou might do that using\nAccess Control List.\n\n249\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.058\nYou might do it using some\nother type of device that\n\n250\n00:12:09.058 --> 00:12:12.844\nyou have management of that gives\nyou that control like group policy.\n\n251\n00:12:12.844 --> 00:12:16.620\nAll of this is actually done at this\naccess layer for what we're doing, okay?\n\n252\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.900\nSo this helps us.\n\n253\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.790\nNotice the number of switches, it's\nnot important that you have eight, but\n\n254\n00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.020\nthe whole goal and idea behind this\nis that you have redundancies here.\n\n255\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.870\nAnd notice that the redundancy\nis everywhere, okay?\n\n256\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.791\nSo everyone of these devices on each\nside of the way that I have this network\n\n257\n00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:37.027\ndivided up here, right, is that each\nswitch actually is connected to, well,\n\n258\n00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:40.100\ntwo other switches here,\nokay, is the minimum.\n\n259\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.250\nAnd then you actually have\nother things happening as well.\n\n260\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.660\nSo at this layer, okay, this is probably\nwhere you'll find the single links and\n\n261\n00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.590\nthat means a single workstation goes down,\nthat's kinda the cost of this.\n\n262\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.390\nBut a single workstation going\ndown is also not gonna bring down\n\n263\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.170\neverything else in your network.\n\n264\n00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.080\nAnd so when you do this,\nthat is where that access layer comes in.\n\n265\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.290\nNow once we get to that point,\nokay, Cisco says what you should\n\n266\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.490\nalso end up doing is having what\nwe call a distribution layer.\n\n267\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.421\nA distribution layer allows us to be able\nto send out so lets say that this guy\n\n268\n00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:19.430\nover here wants to talk to this guy or\neven this guy over here.\n\n269\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.850\nWell, in theory, this is where you can\nstart filtering data at this layer.\n\n270\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.560\nSo you can prevent the left\nside over here from\n\n271\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.720\nactually reaching anything over on\nthe right side if you want to, okay?\n\n272\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.980\nThat's not about controlling\nindividuals as much as its saying look,\n\n273\n00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.450\nI'm just gonna stop it when\nit gets to this point.\n\n274\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.170\nAnd it says, I need to go over here.\n\n275\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.380\nIt's not gonna allow it to go over.\n\n276\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.010\nSo you can actually put in filtering and\n\n277\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.045\neven routing policies\nat this layer as well.\n\n278\n00:13:46.045 --> 00:13:50.130\nSo you might see a combination of\ndifferent types of devices up here.\n\n279\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.597\nDown here on the access layer,\nlet's go back to the model for a moment,\n\n280\n00:13:54.597 --> 00:13:59.130\nbecause it really does kind of help\nus to think about these things too.\n\n281\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:04.020\nAccess layer, you're probably looking at\nlayer two devices a lot of times, right?\n\n282\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.890\nYou're controlling it by the individual\ncomputer, if you need to, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:12.740\nAnd so, in this sense, these are probably\ngonna be what we call layer two switches\n\n284\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.140\nthat really provide just that\naccessibility that we need to for\n\n285\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.490\nconnectivity.\n\n286\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.590\nThen in the distribution layer,\nyou may have layer two switches but\n\n287\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.330\nnormally, here's a term that we're gonna\nalso end up using in our episodes a little\n\n288\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.940\nbit later on, what we call a layer three\nswitch, okay, or a multi layer switch.\n\n289\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.290\nThis particular switch normally also\nhas not only switching capabilities but\n\n290\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.880\nthe ability to do routing as well and\n\n291\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.800\nthe ability to have filtering\npossibilities in terms of routes.\n\n292\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.740\nSo it's here at the distribution layer,\nwe'll have that.\n\n293\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.090\nNotice that we don't need a lot of\nthem because they're more high powered\n\n294\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.100\nthan these particular layer\ntwo switches down here.\n\n295\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.340\nThey can handle a lot more traffic,\nthey can do a lot more in terms of\n\n296\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.150\nthe capabilities that they\nalso have as well, okay?\n\n297\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.210\nSo that's where you have\nthe distribution layer of things and\n\n298\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.580\nwhen you start seeing it.\n\n299\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.349\nThe other ones that Cisco of course\nrecommends if you have this type\n\n300\n00:15:09.349 --> 00:15:11.370\nof network and you're planning for\n\n301\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.218\nscalability is to have\na core networking device.\n\n302\n00:15:14.218 --> 00:15:18.204\nNow this is when Cisco says if\nyou're gonna spend money anyplace,\n\n303\n00:15:18.204 --> 00:15:21.060\nlike top end money,\nhere's where you do this.\n\n304\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.848\nBecause this is gonna make your\nnetwork lightning fast, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:29.299\nSo lightning fast as possible,\nand it's gonna give you, yeah,\n\n306\n00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:32.840\njust that basic connectivity\nthroughout your network.\n\n307\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.950\nNow you also hear the term\nbackbone a lot of times\n\n308\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.480\nwhen you hear this type of connection.\n\n309\n00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.919\nNow all the way up here, so this will\ndecide how everything actually gets to\n\n310\n00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:46.366\nwhere it needs to go if it actually\nneeds to cross boundaries at some point.\n\n311\n00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:51.268\nBut it's the core networking up here that\nreally is the fastest, and notice that on\n\n312\n00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:55.698\nthis one, Daniel We don't apply any\npolicies if we don't need to, okay?\n\n313\n00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:57.949\nSo we want this to be\nthe fastest thing that's\n\n314\n00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:58.900\npossible.\n&gt;&gt; Nothing\n\n315\n00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.210\nencumbering-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n316\n00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.685\n&gt;&gt; That from going where it needs to.\n\n317\n00:16:01.685 --> 00:16:03.010\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we just want it that if it gets\n\n318\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.890\ntraffic up here it says, okay, it's done.\n\n319\n00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.020\nIt's over, it's done.\n\n320\n00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.640\nSo this is where you tend\nto spend the most money.\n\n321\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.530\nSo in this example right,\nthe redundancies,\n\n322\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.490\nwe have two up here at the core.\n\n323\n00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.470\nWe have four down here, we have eight.\n\n324\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.780\nIt's not the numbers that matters,\nit's the redundancy that matters.\n\n325\n00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.130\nEven if I lose this core switch\nover here on this side, Daniel,\n\n326\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.350\nnotice because of the different\nnumber of connections,\n\n327\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:32.170\neach of these even over on the right-hand\nside still has access to the core, so\n\n328\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.540\nit can still filter and\npass forward all the data that needs to.\n\n329\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.040\nSo in every place, even if this\none goes down, but these switches\n\n330\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.780\nare also connected here to other switches\nthat allow them to get by as well.\n\n331\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.050\nSo that is ideally what\nCisco would like you to do.\n\n332\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.100\nNow, that's at an enterprise level, and\n\n333\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.510\nthat's expensive as it can be.\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna have to get\n\n334\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.850\noff the wallet just a tad to\nimplement this type of model.\n\n335\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even at a small scale, right?\n\n336\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.753\nJust to do the redundancy\non some of these things.\n\n337\n00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:04.011\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's gonna cost some money.\n\n338\n00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:06.345\n&gt;&gt; It can cost quite a bit of money.\n\n339\n00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:10.889\nSo what has ended up happening then,\nright, is that most companies go,\n\n340\n00:17:10.889 --> 00:17:12.600\nwe'd love to do this.\n\n341\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.080\nWe really would, but that's just too much.\n\n342\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.416\nIt's more infrastructure.\n&gt;&gt; You think about a small scale,\n\n343\n00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:19.110\nsmall shop.\n\n344\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.964\nMaybe 10, 15, 20 users kind of thing.\n\n345\n00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:24.910\nAnd you say okay, we'll I've got one\nswitch here, I've got my router.\n\n346\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.070\nAnd now, I've gotta basically\n\n347\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.390\ndouble my infrastructure.\n\n348\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.237\n&gt;&gt; Everything, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n349\n00:17:28.237 --> 00:17:31.520\nYou just added a 100% to your budget.\n\n350\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.315\nThink of it in those terms and you start\ngoing, okay we need to try something else,\n\n351\n00:17:35.315 --> 00:17:37.702\nbecause we might not have that money.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n352\n00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:39.590\nthat really is the key, right?\n\n353\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.450\nAnd so, there's another model that\nwe follow but before we move to,\n\n354\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.540\nbecause I'm gonna actually\nemphasize this again.\n\n355\n00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.716\nSo Daniel, notice that because everything\nis actually connected to everything else\n\n356\n00:17:48.716 --> 00:17:52.776\nup here, it brings us back to that kind of\nweird networking topology we were talking\n\n357\n00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:54.148\nabout earlier.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the mesh, and\n\n358\n00:17:54.148 --> 00:17:54.910\nthe hybrid, and the star.\n\n359\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And all that other goodness.\n\n360\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.840\n&gt;&gt; And that particular topology, and\n\n361\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.850\nthe way that they have this, right?\n\n362\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:03.460\nIt's essentially a full mesh, where\nbetween the core and distribution layer.\n\n363\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.684\nEvery device is really connected\nto every other device,\n\n364\n00:18:06.684 --> 00:18:07.690\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n365\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Now, the only one that I left off here,\n\n366\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.380\nand that's just me,\nis that I don't have a link between them.\n\n367\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:12.909\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n368\n00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:14.144\n&gt;&gt; But, overall though,\n\n369\n00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:16.932\nthere's usually a connection\nbetween them as well.\n\n370\n00:18:16.932 --> 00:18:18.600\nI just left it off, that was me.\n\n371\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.945\nThat was just me, as I look down I\nwas like, crap, I didn't do that.\n\n372\n00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:22.820\nBut, that's what you have, right?\n\n373\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.720\nSo it really does help,\nand this mesh topology,\n\n374\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.179\nyou wanna make sure that you understand\nthat as it's actually gonna be very\n\n375\n00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:33.676\nimportant as well as that\nnumber of connections formula.\n\n376\n00:18:33.676 --> 00:18:38.482\nSo, Daniel, remind me again,\ncuz I absolutely know that I've gotten it\n\n377\n00:18:38.482 --> 00:18:41.441\nwrong at least one time during our show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:42.338\n&gt;&gt; So it's N.\n\n379\n00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:44.436\n&gt;&gt; N (N)- 1\n\n380\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.540\n&gt;&gt; And then divided by 2, 2, okay.\n\n381\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.679\nSo remember that for number connections,\nif you are l can't tell you that,\n\n382\n00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:56.315\nthey gonna ask you a question about this,\nso on these exam, okay.\n\n383\n00:18:56.315 --> 00:18:57.424\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you they warn either.\n\n384\n00:18:57.424 --> 00:18:59.181\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you they warn you, but\n\n385\n00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:02.580\nif they say some like here's\nthe number of distribution, you know,\n\n386\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.155\ndevices that you're, here is the number\nof core devices that you have,\n\n387\n00:19:06.155 --> 00:19:09.479\nyou need to full mesh topology\n&gt;&gt; Which of the following aren't going to\n\n388\n00:19:09.479 --> 00:19:10.126\nbe links?\n&gt;&gt; How\n\n389\n00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:10.845\nmany do you need?\n\n390\n00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:11.368\n&gt;&gt; Right..\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:13.238\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how many\n\n392\n00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:15.656\nis on the exam, but.\n&gt;&gt; But you never know.\n\n393\n00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:16.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't tell you it's not on the\n\n394\n00:19:16.995 --> 00:19:19.530\nexam, either, so that what we have to do.\n&gt;&gt; To prepare you for everything.\n\n395\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n396\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.090\nBut just remember that,\nin this one, right?\n\n397\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.550\nThe only one that you should every\nhave a single link to is where?\n\n398\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.270\nAt the axis layer.\n\n399\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.680\nAll the rest are probably\ngonna be redundant.\n\n400\n00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.070\nAnd in this way, right,\neverything is actually duplicated.\n\n401\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.540\nAnd even in a full mesh.\n\n402\n00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.342\nOkay, that's kind of the idea and\nthe key here.\n\n403\n00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:39.163\nNow, the one that we've been talking,\nI wanted to get to this,\n\n404\n00:19:39.163 --> 00:19:41.530\ncuz Daniel made a great intro for\nme and I just kind of.\n\n405\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.095\nLet me stop here for a moment.\n\n406\n00:19:43.095 --> 00:19:47.055\nIs that what you tend to have more\nis called the collapsed core,\n\n407\n00:19:47.055 --> 00:19:49.320\nand that's what this style is for.\n\n408\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.380\nNotice that essentially the core and\n\n409\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.560\ndistribution layer have\ncollapsed together as one.\n\n410\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.110\nSo now, you have four redundancies\nbetween all of your distribution and\n\n411\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.890\nyour core devices here.\n\n412\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.470\nAnd then you have your\naccess devices instead.\n\n413\n00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.860\nSo, does this work?\n\n414\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.550\nYes, okay, a lot of networks,\n\n415\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.880\nsmall to medium networks,\nthis is what they run instead.\n\n416\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.055\nThat's because of those core switches,\nif you really get to them, they can be\n\n417\n00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:17.820\ntens of thousands of dollars, as well.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say this is what we did.\n\n418\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.823\nWe talked about where I had\nsatellite offices that I come in and\n\n419\n00:20:20.823 --> 00:20:21.545\nwork for.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, right.\n\n420\n00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:24.750\n&gt;&gt; At ASA is there in a switch.\n\n421\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.010\nBasically, that's what we were doing,\nyou know.\n\n422\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.680\nWe were using the ASA as the core.\n\n423\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.360\nSometimes, both the core and\nthe switch, you know, on both.\n\n424\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.572\nIt's, bring it down, because we didn't\nneed, it would be overkill to go in there\n\n425\n00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:40.416\nand put a full router,\nput a full switch, plus the ASA.\n\n426\n00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:44.850\nIt would be a cost prohibitive,\nbecause we had 110 offices.\n\n427\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.047\nSo you can start to see where that money\nwould add up, and then just complexity and\n\n428\n00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:49.910\neverything.\n\n429\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.790\nA lot of times,\nthis is the right model to go with.\n\n430\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's because of that.\n\n431\n00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.040\nThe very fact is that, even though Cisco\nsays here's ideally what we want you to\n\n432\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.530\nimplement, well, they're looking at\nthat idea of the enterprise which\n\n433\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.730\nI know that there's probably somewhere\nis Cisco documentation that says,\n\n434\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.460\nhere's what we consider an enterprise,\nokay?\n\n435\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.739\nAnd it's probably due to the number\nof devices that they see.\n\n436\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.220\nI'm pretty sure that it's out there.\n\n437\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.070\nI don't know where to find it,\nbut most of the time, right,\n\n438\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.310\nyou kind of have to go, all right.\n\n439\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.400\nWe really don't need that much for\nevery single office,\n\n440\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.450\nit's probably better like with Daniel\nsaid at branch offices, right?\n\n441\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.420\nYou have just that ASA that's out there\nand you have one link that comes in,\n\n442\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.210\nand that's your router at that point,\nright?\n\n443\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.552\nEverybody else is going out.\n\n444\n00:21:28.552 --> 00:21:32.268\nYou're going on your router,\nDaniel's going across Daniel's VPN.\n\n445\n00:21:32.268 --> 00:21:36.167\nYou're done, okay, at that point,\nand then the routing happens at\n\n446\n00:21:36.167 --> 00:21:40.354\nDaniel's office instead of your office\nonce you actually set the VPN up.\n\n447\n00:21:40.354 --> 00:21:44.022\nBut then if you only have three or\nfour devices, there may be five or\n\n448\n00:21:44.022 --> 00:21:47.495\nsix ports on here that you're\njust connecting all your devices\n\n449\n00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:49.540\nin that office to anyways and run it.\n\n450\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.610\nDo it the way that you need to.\n\n451\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.540\nSo all this is happening too.\n\n452\n00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.480\nSo remember that on this one, when they\ncall it a Collapse core, which is probably\n\n453\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.670\nwhat I should just title it here,\ncuz I didn't actually put a title on it.\n\n454\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:08.053\nThat was my fault here and\nwe'll call this the Collapsed Core model.\n\n455\n00:22:08.053 --> 00:22:12.628\nYou'll probably see this more often\nin practice unless it's really a big\n\n456\n00:22:12.628 --> 00:22:16.880\nbusiness and that there's\nprobably some type of regulation.\n\n457\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.781\nThat says you need to follow\nthis particular model and\n\n458\n00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:22.110\nmake sure that it's done this way, okay.\n\n459\n00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.274\nSo, of course,\neach of these layers then, Daniel,\n\n460\n00:22:24.274 --> 00:22:27.078\nwhen we start taking that whether\nwe're talking about this or this.\n\n461\n00:22:27.078 --> 00:22:32.100\nYou also have to consider everything else,\nright?\n\n462\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.540\nEspecially in terms of security.\n\n463\n00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.120\nYou need to make sure that you\nhave all those things secured and\n\n464\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.400\nthe way that you want to.\n\n465\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.240\nThese devices down here at the access\nlayer will of course be less secure\n\n466\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.120\nthan these devices up here.\n\n467\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.091\nSo many more people get exposure and\n\n468\n00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:48.512\naccess to these rather than up\nhere at the core distribution.\n\n469\n00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:52.958\nSo Daniel on your ASA, I'm assuming you\ndidn't just put that up like right outside\n\n470\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:56.451\nof the office door,\nopening into the building go, yeah, sure,\n\n471\n00:22:56.451 --> 00:23:00.767\njust let people just come in and pull the\npower plug out and unplug those cables and\n\n472\n00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:04.458\nplug them back in, right?\n&gt;&gt; I would love to tell you that, but\n\n473\n00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:09.640\nthere were some offices that literally\nthe bathroom was the closet.\n\n474\n00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.460\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that as well.\n\n475\n00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.641\n&gt;&gt; It was mount on the wall,\n\n476\n00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:13.308\nand then there was a toilet\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I saw\n\n477\n00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:15.695\none where the hot water heater was above.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't do that.\n\n478\n00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:16.485\n&gt;&gt; Above the toilets.\n\n479\n00:23:16.485 --> 00:23:17.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't do that.\n\n480\n00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:19.145\n&gt;&gt; Where the hot water heater was actually\n\n481\n00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:22.051\nmounted above the toilet and then the ASA\nwas sitting above on the water heater.\n\n482\n00:23:22.051 --> 00:23:23.145\n&gt;&gt; There's a good spot for it.\n\n483\n00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:24.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which was unusual but\n\n484\n00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:25.824\nit was up there, so.\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n485\n00:23:25.824 --> 00:23:26.814\nwhat are you doing there?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n486\n00:23:26.814 --> 00:23:31.425\nyou end up seeing quite a bit in reality,\nright, and that's the key.\n\n487\n00:23:31.425 --> 00:23:34.135\nThis is great, the three tier and\nthe collapsed core.\n\n488\n00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:37.090\nIf you can wire it all up\nthe way that you want to.\n\n489\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.190\nIdeally this is the way that you\nessentially would end up going.\n\n490\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.447\nBut in reality, you're gonna get\nwhatever you get when you move in.\n\n491\n00:23:43.447 --> 00:23:44.929\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna inherit somebody else's\n\n492\n00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:46.995\nmess.\n&gt;&gt; You are gonna inherit somebody else's\n\n493\n00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:49.270\nmess, and so it's your job to understand.\n\n494\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.310\nHere's ideally what we see, but\nhere's what I'm gonna be working with.\n\n495\n00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.050\nAnd then you kinda start working and\n\n496\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.160\nfixing the way that you\nactually need it to.\n\n497\n00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.540\nOverall Daniel the goal is fairly simple.\n\n498\n00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.500\nThis actually helps us with both\nthat idea of capacity planning,\n\n499\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.410\nour scalability up, and then of\ncourse capability planning as well.\n\n500\n00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.940\nWhich helps us to scale out\nto do more as we need to.\n\n501\n00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.580\nThat our business doesn't go, you know,\nI think at this point we're going to move\n\n502\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.030\noff those Cisco switches, because they\ncan't handle what we need anymore.\n\n503\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.250\nAnd now, you're like wait a minute,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa,\n\n504\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.800\nwait a minute-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n505\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.880\n&gt;&gt; I just spend time building all this up.\n\n506\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.810\nYeah, but you didn't plan for\nthis so, yeesh.\n\n507\n00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.970\nSo, make sure, yes, you take a look\nat this idea of the different types\n\n508\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.250\nof these core architectures\nthat you'll tend to find.\n\n509\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.780\nCisco, of course,\nrecommends that you memorize these.\n\n510\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.830\nI recommend it too if you're gonna\nbe taking that C7 exam as well.\n\n511\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.560\nSo Daniel, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n512\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.580\nwell Ronnie, it was good stuff.\n\n513\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.015\nVery good information out there.\n\n514\n00:24:42.015 --> 00:24:45.691\nLike Ronnie said, it's pertinent for\nthe exam, but it's also good for\n\n515\n00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:48.450\nus to understand what\ngoes into network design.\n\n516\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.580\nHow do we build an architecture that's\ngoing to be robust and redundant, and\n\n517\n00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.740\nall the great things that we want and\ncome to expect from our modern networks.\n\n518\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.140\nRonnie, thanks so much for\nexplaining this to us.\n\n519\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.193\nWe thank you good folks out there for\nwatching, but\n\n520\n00:25:01.193 --> 00:25:03.838\nit looks like we've come to the end of yet\nanother great episode.\n\n521\n00:25:03.838 --> 00:25:05.790\nHopefully, you've enjoyed it and\nlearned a little something, but\n\n522\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.470\nit's time to sign off.\n\n523\n00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.820\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n524\n00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n525\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.484\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n526\n00:25:10.484 --> 00:25:17.902\n[MUSIC]\n\n527\n00:25:17.902 -->

California [CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:08.501\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:13.680\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.000\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.830\nin today's episode,\nwe're back with more of our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.130\nAnd joining us, of course, in the studio,\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.220\nRonnie, welcome back man.\n\n10\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.770\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.920\nAs we continue to take a look at more of\nwhat we need to learn for the CCENT exam,\n\n12\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.300\ntoday we get to talk about cabling,\nwhich of course is exciting.\n\n13\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.227\nNow, for those of you that have already\ngone through A Plus, the CompTIA A+,\n\n14\n00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:47.860\nCompTIA Network+,\nthis is the same type of material.\n\n15\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.149\nBut of course it means yes you'll also be\nquestioned on that and the CCENT as well,\n\n16\n00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.150\nand it's because it's just basic network,\nall right?\n\n17\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.779\nSo there's a few different components that\nwe need to make sure that we go over and\n\n18\n00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:03.830\nif you go, hey look, I'm really\nfamiliar with this, that's fine.\n\n19\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.310\nOnce again, our reminder is this,\nif you have\n\n20\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.110\nany inkling that you don't know what\nthis is, make sure you review it.\n\n21\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.300\nIf you don't review this one,\nreview the A plus one.\n\n22\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.970\nReview the network plus one.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n23\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.370\n&gt;&gt; Get it down,\n\n24\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.560\nbecause this is easy exam points for\nyou as you start to do this.\n\n25\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.470\nBut there are gonna be a few things\nthat may be slightly off from\n\n26\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.780\nwhat you learned in the CompTIA world.\n\n27\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.986\nBecause in CompTIA,\n\n28\n00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:30.032\nit is supposed to be vendor neutral\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:31.762\n&gt;&gt; Okay and in Cisco there is very\n\n30\n00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:33.640\nspecific terms that they like.\n\n31\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.232\nSo as you hear me describe\nsome of them and you go,\n\n32\n00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:40.853\nhey I didn't learn it that way in CompTIA\nA+, well just, it's not that it's wrong,\n\n33\n00:01:40.853 --> 00:01:45.620\nit's just that it's not Cisco specific,\nso make sure you pay attention there.\n\n34\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.730\nSo of course, we need to begin by talking\nabout some of the different types of\n\n35\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.850\ncabling that's out there and some of the\nmedia types that's also out there as well.\n\n36\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500\nWe though are really focusing on the idea\nof making sure that you know what\n\n37\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.450\ncable to actually select in\nan appropriate instance or\n\n38\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.500\na scenario that you're given,\nis really the key.\n\n39\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.750\nBut that means, of course, you already\nknow what types of cables there are, so\n\n40\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.280\nthat is an assumption.\n\n41\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880\nBut we're going to make sure that you\nunderstand that there's several different\n\n42\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.640\ntypes of cables to choose from and you\nneed to know what each one of them does.\n\n43\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.440\nSo we're not going into all of\nthe actual specifics that you would get,\n\n44\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.690\nsuch as the A+, or the Network+,\n\n45\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.610\nCompTIA Network+, we're not\ngetting into that level of detail.\n\n46\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.572\nBut we are gonna show you\nsome of them as a examples.\n\n47\n00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:33.330\nHopefully, they'll show up very well,\nso that you can see them.\n\n48\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.120\nBut also, of course,\nthen put that into context of\n\n49\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.760\nwhere you tend to use these cables and\nwhat you also see them in as well, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.780\nSo when we start taking a look then at the\nidea of cables, okay, we're talking about\n\n51\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.530\nbounded media or things that go\ninside of wires of some sort.\n\n52\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.480\nSo for us it's going to be either\ncopper cabling, generically,\n\n53\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.310\nthat have copper as their core.\n\n54\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.010\nOr it's gonna be fiber optic cable, okay,\n\n55\n00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.440\nthat's pretty much the two media\ntypes as far as cables go.\n\n56\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.740\nIf you go wireless that's\ngonna be radio frequency.\n\n57\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.790\nSomething else here that you might have,\nbut overall I would usually radio\n\n58\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.500\nfrequency is what we tend to\ntalk about in terms of wireless.\n\n59\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.250\nSo let's get specific then and\n\n60\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.870\nlet's start off with this idea of\nlooking at fiber optic cabling first.\n\n61\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.510\nSo on my screen, I'm going ahead and\nI pulled this up for you.\n\n62\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.080\nI made a diagram that helped to show you\nthe breakdown of a fiber optic cable.\n\n63\n00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.770\nNow, the reason that we need to know this\nis because a fiber optic cable by itself\n\n64\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.720\nis not like a regular copper cable, which\nyou have some covering on the cable and\n\n65\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.020\nthen you have, of course, the copper cable\nitself and it's just one monolithic part.\n\n66\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.020\nInside of a fiber optic cable itself,\nthe core that you see right here,\n\n67\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.200\nwhich is usually made of glass,\nis as thin or thinner than a human hair.\n\n68\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.330\nSo let's say that the idea\nhere of that core for\n\n69\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.130\nwhat we are actually seeing here, a human\nhair is about 50 microns in thickness,\n\n70\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.530\na core is normally smaller than that.\n\n71\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.070\nThat's all we are really concerned about.\n\n72\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.670\nBut it is fragile by itself, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.200\nSo all by itself it's\nincredibly fragile and\n\n74\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.540\nmost of the time when you start dealing\nwith that cable itself cuz it's so\n\n75\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.120\nthin it really can break if you're\nnot careful with the cable.\n\n76\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.450\nSo to strengthen it they also put what\nthey call cladding around the core itself\n\n77\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.890\nto help provide for some strengthening.\n\n78\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.450\nAnd then you may have what we call,\nof course, coding and a buffer.\n\n79\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.970\nAll that actually starts\nappearing in different layers.\n\n80\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.480\nSo if you take this cross section,\nwhich I've broken everything out and\n\n81\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.120\nyou turn it and\nyou take a look at it at its ends.\n\n82\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.918\nI've given you two different\ntypes here to look at.\n\n83\n00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:48.240\nNow, Daniel, I'm hoping that you can see\nthere is a difference between the top\n\n84\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.176\ncircles and the bottom ones there.\n&gt;&gt; Just give me a second, I'll see it.\n\n85\n00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:53.669\nI'll see it, hold on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.979\n&gt;&gt; It got its hair done.\n\n87\n00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.920\nIt's lost weight, kind of.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does actually look like that.\n\n88\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.240\nSo on the top one that you tend to see,\n\n89\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.760\nnotice that the core is much smaller\nthen the one here on the bottom.\n\n90\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.930\nAnd that's because there's two\ntypes of fiber optic cables\n\n91\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.050\nthat generally are run for\nmost people doing networking.\n\n92\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.130\nThere's what we call,\nsingle mode fiber, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.410\nWhich is this one.\n\n94\n00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.690\nMuch smaller in its diameter size,\n\n95\n00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.510\nmuch larger in the cladding\nto help protect it much more.\n\n96\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.040\nAnd then you have what we call\nmulti-mode fiber as well, so\n\n97\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.810\nthey support two different modes\nof what we're talking about, so\n\n98\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.930\nthat's what we end up seeing there.\n\n99\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.200\nNow, the breakdown of what\ndoes that actually mean.\n\n100\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.279\nWell, here's the easiest way for\n\n101\n00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.444\nme to show you what that\nactually means here, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:49.094\nSo on the top diagram that I've\nactually produced here, right,\n\n103\n00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:53.828\nin a multi-mode fiber because we\nhave a much thicker micron core,\n\n104\n00:05:53.828 --> 00:05:59.610\nabout 62 and half microns normally,\nokay, is what you tend to see there.\n\n105\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.065\nIt allows you to send multiple\ndifferent wave lengths or\n\n106\n00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:08.729\ndifferent sources of light\ndown that multi-mode fibre.\n\n107\n00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.415\nAnd what it does, is it uses, of course,\nthe size of that fiber optic core to\n\n108\n00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:18.030\nbounce different fiber or\ndifferent light signals down that core.\n\n109\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.800\nSo now, you can actually have\na massive amount of different\n\n110\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.550\nwavelengths of light going down the core,\nwhich allows you to\n\n111\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.240\ntransmit quite a bit of data.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of cool because they don't\n\n112\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.305\ninterfere with each other,\n\n113\n00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:29.040\nthey're on different wavelengths.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n114\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.310\nthey are on different wavelengths.\n\n115\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.860\nAnd it really is cuz you\ncan now just transmit\n\n116\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.040\nmultiple signals down that\nparticular fiber that you have.\n\n117\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.450\nNow, it's light source is\ngonna be an LED lamp, so\n\n118\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.530\na very high powered LED lamp,\nbecause you need what?\n\n119\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.750\nYou need multiple sources of light,\nso that's the way that they do it.\n\n120\n00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.813\nThey actually put different wavelengths\nof light in each one of those LEDs,\n\n121\n00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:55.680\nvery powerful,\nnever look down a fiber optic cable.\n\n122\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.946\nSo if somebody comes to\nyou as you're working for\n\n123\n00:06:57.946 --> 00:07:00.820\nthe first day and goes,\nhere take a long hard look at this fiber\n\n124\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.610\noptic cable.\n&gt;&gt; See if you see that down there, you see\n\n125\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.070\nthat break down there, go ahead and look.\n&gt;&gt; The neat thing is you can\n\n126\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.420\nactually see it cuz it's a pin point\nof light that you end up seeing.\n\n127\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.020\nBut don't look at it,\nI know it sounds strange.\n\n128\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.710\nYou can do a glancing look, but don't\nsit and go, I don't really see it and\n\n129\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.541\njust continue to stare at it.\n&gt;&gt; Why are my eyes all red and puffy?\n\n130\n00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It can really cause some damage.\n\n131\n00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.947\n&gt;&gt; Say it with me, macular degeneration,\n\n132\n00:07:25.947 --> 00:07:28.780\nthat's right.\n&gt;&gt; It can burn, it can burn, so\n\n133\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.200\ndon't do that.\n\n134\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.670\nSo if somebody tells you that,\ngo, I'm not doing that.\n\n135\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.950\nThat's pretty much key, don't do that.\n\n136\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.290\nJust when I say that, right?\n\n137\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.263\nThat's how, I had said that's\nmy poor man's test of whether or\n\n138\n00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:40.922\nnot I'm getting good connection.\n\n139\n00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:42.304\nI go yep, light's there and\n\n140\n00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:43.577\nthat's what I do.\n&gt;&gt; We're ready\n\n141\n00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:44.110\nto rock.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n142\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.866\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Where'd you go?\n\n143\n00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:47.374\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I see spots.\n\n144\n00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:48.550\nI don't know why.\n&gt;&gt; They'll go away.\n\n145\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.089\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Some of them went\n\n146\n00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.958\naway.\n&gt;&gt; I think most of them.\n\n147\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:51.599\n&gt;&gt; Some of them, yeah.\n\n148\n00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.039\n[LAUGH] But not all of them.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n149\n00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.478\n&gt;&gt; But multi-mode fiber is more common\n\n150\n00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:57.607\nwithin small networks, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:01.465\nAnd what I mean by that is usually\nthey're limited by distance.\n\n152\n00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:04.880\nSo there's a maximum distance\nhere that you can run them.\n\n153\n00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.690\nSo normally underneath a kilometer.\n\n154\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.370\nSometimes even 500 meters.\n\n155\n00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.530\nIt just depends on the wavelength of fiber\nand everything else that you get and\n\n156\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.500\nalso the source itself is also helpful.\n\n157\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.340\nNow, the other one is what\nwe call single mode fiber.\n\n158\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.620\nNow, single mode fiber, notice that\nthe core itself is much, well, smaller.\n\n159\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.860\nNotice it's about 9 microns.\n\n160\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.280\nSo it's about six times smaller and\nthis one, the actual source,\n\n161\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.130\nis a high intensity laser beam instead.\n\n162\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.866\nWhich is of course attached\nto shark's ahead and-\n\n163\n00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:40.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.630\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not really.\n\n165\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.200\n[LAUGH] So it's a laser beam that\nactually shoots itself down this core.\n\n166\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.110\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't see that application and\n\n167\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.540\nyou attach them to a shark's head.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what Dr.\n\n168\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.480\nEvil told me to and so I did it.\n\n169\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.710\nAnd so that's what happened.\n\n170\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.050\nSo here it is,\nit has a single source of light.\n\n171\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.890\nAnd so from one end to the other it\nis only, has one frequency of light.\n\n172\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.380\nNow it's advantage here is distance,\n\n173\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:10.600\nthis can cover kilometers it can even\ncover 50 kilometers if you need it to.\n\n174\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.650\nMost of the time they try and limit that\nto about 30 or so, somewhere around that,\n\n175\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.860\n30 to 40 kilometers.\n\n176\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.680\nBut it can go very long distances\nwhen you start to pull this out and\n\n177\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.200\nstart to do that.\n\n178\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.895\nSo those are kind of the basics when we\nstart talking about the idea of fiber\n\n179\n00:09:26.895 --> 00:09:28.050\noptics here.\n\n180\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.310\nNow there's also different connector\ntypes that you'll run into.\n\n181\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.670\nAnd this is all going to\nbe application specific\n\n182\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.730\nto the device that you're connecting to.\n\n183\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.190\nSo, what we will actually\nsee is a couple of them.\n\n184\n00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.420\nThese are the most standard types\nof connectors you will usually see.\n\n185\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.199\nWe're going to show you one that\nis called the LC connector,\n\n186\n00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:50.104\nif I remember correctly and\nthen the standard connector here.\n\n187\n00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.147\nThe rest of these are usually\napplication specific for\n\n188\n00:09:53.147 --> 00:09:55.530\nsomething that they want you to do.\n\n189\n00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.260\nBut like some of them, and not this one.\n\n190\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.290\nThere's one,\nI can't remember what it's called.\n\n191\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.710\nI think it's this one, this MTRJ, but\nI could be wrong, that's actually designed\n\n192\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.940\nfor like underwater usage.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n193\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n194\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.410\nthere's different applications for\nall these, you don't know about it.\n\n195\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.660\nBut then when you see like, that connector\nis made of stainless steel I wonder why\n\n196\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.580\nthat connector's made of stainless steel-\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n197\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.760\n&gt;&gt; And it's threaded, and you're like,\n\n198\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.450\nit's because it's for wet applications\nthat don't want water to get through and\n\n199\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.830\ncause any type of\ncorruption of the signal.\n\n200\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.530\nSo there's different things\nthat they're made for, but\n\n201\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.160\nyou'll actually see this, too.\n\n202\n00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.490\nSo let's go ahead and do that, and we're\ngonna switch our view right here so that\n\n203\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.910\nwe can show you just a couple of instances\nhere of fiber optics that we find\n\n204\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.485\nright here in the building at ITPRO.TV so\nthat you can take a look at them.\n\n205\n00:10:46.055 --> 00:10:50.195\nOkay so Daniel what we're taking a look\nat here is I've pulled one of these,\n\n206\n00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:52.195\nI didn't pull it out of\nthe wall I should say that.\n\n207\n00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:56.585\nWe have a box or\na reel I should say of this cable here.\n\n208\n00:10:56.585 --> 00:11:01.620\nNow this is a fiber optic cable\nthat is designed to run actually,\n\n209\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.600\nin the ceiling, inside of walls and stuff.\n\n210\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.700\nAnd this is what is called\nplenum type of fiber optics.\n\n211\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.350\nAnd usually on the outside\nof all the cables,\n\n212\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.750\nyou'll see it kind of imprint in or\nlaser imprint in.\n\n213\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.270\nAnd I know it's small but\nit says plenum type right here.\n\n214\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.810\nSo this is the step that's design\nto go into the walls itself.\n\n215\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.340\nNow, I also cut off like piece of it.\n\n216\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.740\nYou'll have these kind of leader right\nhere that allows you to pull on it,\n\n217\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.590\nto help strengthen everything.\n\n218\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.100\nSo, as you pull on it you're not\nactually pulling on the fibers and\n\n219\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.410\nmuch as,\nthis is actually helping to guide and\n\n220\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.010\nhelping making sure everything\nmaintains the strength.\n\n221\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.530\nBut if I separate this out, so here it is,\n\n222\n00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.450\nops, I'm just stop pulling\nall the stuff out here.\n\n223\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.690\nYou'll see that it has all\nthe rest of this stuff and\n\n224\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.510\nthen there's actually three pairs\nof fibers if I can get to them too.\n\n225\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:54.300\nSo each of, when we start taking a look\nat fiber optics cables, there's always\n\n226\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:00.640\na sending and there's always a receiving\npair or wire is what you end up seeing.\n\n227\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.143\nSo if I try and pull away all of this\ncladding stuff and this filler here,\n\n228\n00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:08.749\nyou should end up seeing where\nthere is multiple wires and\n\n229\n00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:11.707\nI believe that that is\nall of these wires here.\n\n230\n00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:14.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's harder to actually grab-\n\n231\n00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n232\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.060\n&gt;&gt; So now, normally what you do is you\n\n233\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.930\ntake pairs, and these of course are\nstandardized of what pairs that you do.\n\n234\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.130\nSo will actually end up\nbeing a sending wire and\n\n235\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.470\none will actually be a receiving wire,\nis what will happen.\n\n236\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.660\nSo this one is actually designed\nto be four pair, I'm lying to you.\n\n237\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.280\nI thought this was three pair, so\n\n238\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.660\nI actually have eight different wires in\nhere which I'm lying to you once again,\n\n239\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.050\nno that's actually\nthe strengthening wire right there.\n\n240\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.710\nIn the center, cuz that's actually\nvery stiff as what you'll see.\n\n241\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.390\nSo this is three pairs, there's\nactually six right here that I can see.\n\n242\n00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.350\nBut I'm not, nope, I am lying to you\nagain cuz I can't see all of them.\n\n243\n00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.640\nBut let me see if I can pull this aside.\n\n244\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.170\nAnd there we go,\nthat will actually bring it out.\n\n245\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.573\nAnd you'll see that there's the orange and\ngreen, there's this brown and gray pair.\n\n246\n00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:07.620\nAnd then there is blue and another one and\nthen this white and the other one.\n\n247\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.480\nSo you can actually see that\nthere is actually three or\n\n248\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.270\nfour pair in here somehow.\n\n249\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.560\nIt all actually does\nmake sense at some point.\n\n250\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.310\nBut that's what you end up getting.\n\n251\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.500\nInside your walls when they pull this.\n\n252\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.660\nSome companies will kind\nof terminate one pair.\n\n253\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.880\nThey may terminate two or\nthree at the other end.\n\n254\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.190\nBut it again costs you every\ntime you get them terminated.\n\n255\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.500\nBut that's an example of some of\nthe wires that you end up seeing.\n\n256\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.320\nNow once you get past the wall and\n\n257\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.030\nyou come into that termination point,\nnormally you'll be using cable\n\n258\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.256\nsomething like this that will have\ndifferent connectors on the end.\n\n259\n00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:44.900\nAnd here although I actually have\nconnectors in this one I believe is an LC\n\n260\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.510\nconnector if I remember correctly and\nit's actually just two small connectors,\n\n261\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.205\none for sending and one for receiving.\n\n262\n00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:56.180\nYou have a down line, and your source will\nend up coming out of a device like this,\n\n263\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:02.560\nthis is an SFP, a small form pluggable is\nwhat this device is called right here.\n\n264\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.050\nEach one of them will have a label on it.\n\n265\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.240\nIt's very difficult for us to see here.\n\n266\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.000\nBut it will actually tell you the speed\nand what the length it can go.\n\n267\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.110\nSo this one says 300 meters and\nthat's an 815 nanometer wavelength.\n\n268\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.280\nSo it shows you what you would do.\n\n269\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.050\nSo if this is plugged into a device\nsuch as a Cisco switch that you have,\n\n270\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.440\nthen you simply take this connector and\nyou plug it right in and\n\n271\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.400\nit locks in place and\nit doesn't go anywhere.\n\n272\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.070\nYou have to unplug it.\n\n273\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.980\nYou push down on this tab and\nthen you can do that.\n\n274\n00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.890\nNow, some people go well,\ndo I leave this down or do I leave it up?\n\n275\n00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.120\nWell if you leave it down, and try and\npush this in, it doesn't lock into place.\n\n276\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.470\nSo that way you can test and\nverify whether or\n\n277\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:50.010\nnot you have it right, by plugging in,\nand now it's not actually letting it go.\n\n278\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.430\nSo once that's actually in there, you\nare ready to go using a cable like that.\n\n279\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.130\nSo that's some of the fiber\noptic cable that you also get.\n\n280\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.960\nThere is,\nusually when you unpackage it though.\n\n281\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.890\nIf you buy them premade, notice how\nit's not wrapped out tightly in a coil.\n\n282\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.560\nThat's because it is the fiber optic they\ndon't wanna bend in an unusual shape that\n\n283\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.980\nit doesn't want to go.\n\n284\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.360\nThis one is actually designed\nto go between devices with well,\n\n285\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.290\ndifferent connectors.\n\n286\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.170\nSo this one over here on this side\nhas this kind of locking connector.\n\n287\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.500\nThis is a standard SC connector.\n\n288\n00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.620\nNotice how much bigger it is than the LC.\n\n289\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.790\nI think a lot of people call\n\n290\n00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.980\nthe LC the little connector.\n\n291\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Little connector.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n292\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.570\n&gt;&gt; It's easy to remember.\n\n293\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.000\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly, and so\n\n294\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.190\nyou can see that.\n\n295\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.740\nAnd technically LC stands for\nlucent connector, I know it's weird but\n\n296\n00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.260\nit's true.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going with little [LAUGH]\n\n297\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.124\n&gt;&gt; Little, yeah,\n\n298\n00:15:39.124 --> 00:15:42.404\ncuz that's what we described it,\n[CROSSTALK] one device here.\n\n299\n00:15:42.404 --> 00:15:45.876\nOne device may have an older connector\nlike this and another one has a new one,\n\n300\n00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:47.220\nyou'd use a cable like this.\n\n301\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.555\nIt's still the same\ntype of cabling inside,\n\n302\n00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:55.220\njust the connectors are different\n&gt;&gt; Now it may be of course this may be\n\n303\n00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.645\nmultimode compared to single mode.\n\n304\n00:15:57.645 --> 00:15:58.153\nIt just depends.\n\n305\n00:15:58.153 --> 00:16:00.317\nYou'll have to read the packaging to know.\n\n306\n00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:02.641\nBut can you actually spot\nthe difference from the outside?\n\n307\n00:16:02.641 --> 00:16:03.817\nNo, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:06.569\nYou really can't,\nwhether it's multi-mode or single-mode,\n\n309\n00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.132\nI can't tell you the difference\njust by looking at it, okay?\n\n310\n00:16:09.132 --> 00:16:14.016\nBut you will actually be able to at least\nsee that in terms of fiber optic types of\n\n311\n00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:14.770\ncabling.\n\n312\n00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.610\nSo you just kind of make sure that\nyou understand that those are some of\n\n313\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.490\nthe cabling types that you\nwill end up seeing, all right?\n\n314\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.880\nSo that's fiber optics for us.\n\n315\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.600\nAnd that means, we are also\nready to take a look then at our\n\n316\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.430\nnext little bit of cabling here\nthat we have to talk about as well.\n\n317\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.185\nSo we're actually seeing that a lot\nof times, even here at ITProTV,\n\n318\n00:16:35.185 --> 00:16:39.069\nthe fiber optic that we use is really\ndesigned for us to get the video that\n\n319\n00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:41.160\nwe're actually doing right now.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n320\n00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.794\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n321\n00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:45.390\nthen send that over to our\nworkstations that will be edited,\n\n322\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.951\nif they need to be edited.\n\n323\n00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:49.370\nAnd then, of course,\ntransferred to the storage device.\n\n324\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.080\nSo it really does help,\nbecause we're on a 10 gigabit network.\n\n325\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.610\nSo it really allows for fast transfers for\n\n326\n00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.810\nthose, because we want our videos to be up\nand ready to go as soon as they're done.\n\n327\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.010\nSo we've put them on\nan ultra fast network.\n\n328\n00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.450\nEverybody else around the building,\nyou may have wireless or\n\n329\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.826\nyou may have your gigabit\nconnection at your workstation.\n\n330\n00:17:08.826 --> 00:17:12.160\nBut just kind of realize that not\neverybody needs that in every single place\n\n331\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.790\nthat they go, okay?\n\n332\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.770\nSo what is our next connector now, it's\nprobably by far still the most popular one\n\n333\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:23.250\nthat's most found is gonna be the copper\ntype of cabling that we end up using.\n\n334\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:28.770\nNow the copper cabling that we end\nup using is actually going to be\n\n335\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:34.080\nwhat we call the traditionally unshielded\ntwisted pair of cabling, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.210\nUnshielded twisted pair\ncabling is a bundle of\n\n337\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.600\neight wires that are twisted\naround each other.\n\n338\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.228\nActually, four twisted\npairs bundled together and\n\n339\n00:17:44.228 --> 00:17:46.709\nthe outer jacket is made out of PVC.\n\n340\n00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:50.518\nNow there is a shielded twisted pair\nthat has a foil wrapper around it, and\n\n341\n00:17:50.518 --> 00:17:54.575\nthose are designed for high interference\nenvironments if you need them to, or\n\n342\n00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:57.464\nyou really,\nsignal loss is really a gigantic concern,\n\n343\n00:17:57.464 --> 00:17:59.564\nthen you might use something like that.\n\n344\n00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:01.594\nBut you limit the distance, so for\n\n345\n00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:05.585\nus we're gonna take a look at this\nidea of the twisted pair cabling.\n\n346\n00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:09.224\nWe're gonna show you example on that, I'm\nnot too worried about sharing this one as\n\n347\n00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:12.774\nfar as reality goes, as far as shown, cuz\nyou probably have held one in your hand.\n\n348\n00:18:12.774 --> 00:18:15.805\nFor all I know, you're actually\nprobably holding one in your hand right\n\n349\n00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:18.260\nnow looking at it as you're\nstarting to see that.\n\n350\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.195\nBut overall though, we need to pay\nattention to these because it's really\n\n351\n00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:26.380\nimportant that you understand those eight\nwires and their placements inside of\n\n352\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.211\nthe connectors, because that's what\nwill have to happen here, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:36.022\nThere's two types of cables that we end\nup making with unshielded twisted pair.\n\n354\n00:18:36.022 --> 00:18:39.738\nThere's what we call a straight through\ncable, and then there's what we call\n\n355\n00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:43.079\na cross over cable, which I've\nforgotten the name of for [INAUDIBLE].\n\n356\n00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:46.070\nAll right, so let's take a look at my\nscreen here and this will help us out.\n\n357\n00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.420\nI drew a very short cable, [LAUGH]\nthat's what I did here on our screen.\n\n358\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.980\nSo if you take a look from the end result,\nokay, what you actually end up seeing.\n\n359\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:19:00.354\nThere's two different standards\ncalled TIA, EIA standards, 568A.\n\n360\n00:19:00.354 --> 00:19:03.581\nIt always starts with pin number one,\nokay?\n\n361\n00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:08.405\nSo as you look at the connector itself\nwith the locking tongue facing away\n\n362\n00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:13.086\nfrom you, pin number one will always\nbe on your left hand side, okay?\n\n363\n00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:16.369\nSo if you're actually looking at it and\nthe locking tongue is not facing you,\n\n364\n00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:19.810\nit's always gonna be on\nthe left-hand side, pin number one.\n\n365\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.400\nAnd then the same thing over on the other\nend of your cable as you make these,\n\n366\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.170\nis gonna be the same thing as well.\n\n367\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.370\nNotice that you follow this pattern.\n\n368\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.920\nNow do you have to follow that pattern?\n\n369\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.200\nIn reality, Dan, if I wanted to, as\nlong as I keep both ends the same, okay?\n\n370\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.950\nIt doesn't matter, so\nas long as I keep the color pattern on one\n\n371\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:38.850\nend.\n&gt;&gt; You're good to go.\n\n372\n00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.530\n&gt;&gt; The same, and\n\n373\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.550\nthe color pattern on the other\nend the same, you're good to go.\n\n374\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.190\nThe problem here though, is now if Daniel\ncomes behind me and he's taking over my\n\n375\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.470\nposition, cuz I've been promoted or\nfired probably, more likely, right?\n\n376\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.110\nDaniel pulls out that cable,\ncuz it looks like it's bad and\n\n377\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.268\nhe's going, what is that?\n&gt;&gt; That's the Ronnie [INAUDIBLE]\n\n378\n00:19:56.268 --> 00:19:57.300\n&gt;&gt; That's the Ronnie [INAUDIBLE]\n\n379\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.524\n&gt;&gt; One, two, three right there.\n\n380\n00:19:58.524 --> 00:19:59.564\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n381\n00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:00.479\nthat is terrible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n382\n00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:01.752\n&gt;&gt; Because it means that nobody knows if\n\n383\n00:20:01.752 --> 00:20:03.942\nit's because of bad cabling at this point.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n384\n00:20:03.942 --> 00:20:04.986\n&gt;&gt; So this is a very easy way,\n\n385\n00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.368\nand this is the standard that\nmost people end up following.\n\n386\n00:20:07.368 --> 00:20:08.894\n&gt;&gt; It kind of reminds me of the whole ISO,\n\n387\n00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:10.696\nOSI model, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n388\n00:20:10.696 --> 00:20:11.880\n&gt;&gt; It's a guideline.\n\n389\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.860\nIt's not a hard and\nfast rule that you must follow, but\n\n390\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.420\nit sure is beneficial to kind of go\nalong with what everybody else is doing.\n\n391\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.150\nSo if these things happen, you know why.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n392\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.015\nYeah, so this one is actually very\nimportant, because not only are we really\n\n393\n00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.631\ntalking about the idea here\nof just the connectors,\n\n394\n00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:31.810\nthere's also two types of cables that\nare prevalently found today in networking.\n\n395\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:37.640\nThat's 100 megabit networking cables and\nthen gigabit networking cables as well.\n\n396\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.250\nSo it does matter in the pattern as we see\nwhen we get to the cross server cables,\n\n397\n00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.808\nbut here's one standard 568A.\n\n398\n00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:49.981\nThe other standard that you're\nalso likely to see is 568B.\n\n399\n00:20:49.981 --> 00:20:52.775\nThe real big difference is actually\nright here, the pattern and\n\n400\n00:20:52.775 --> 00:20:54.400\nthe way that it begins.\n\n401\n00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.185\nPins 1 and 2, and pins 3 and\n6 are reversed in the color order.\n\n402\n00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:05.600\nSo in the 568A, pins 1 and\n2 are the white green and the green.\n\n403\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.160\nPins 3 and 6 is the white orange and\nthe orange cable, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.480\nIf you're actually following 568A.\n\n405\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.794\nNow notice that 568B though it says no.\n\n406\n00:21:15.794 --> 00:21:18.361\nWe're gonna actually put\nthe orange in one place and\n\n407\n00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:20.062\nthe green in the other place here.\n\n408\n00:21:20.062 --> 00:21:22.568\nAnd you might be wondering if you\nare not really familiar with networking,\n\n409\n00:21:22.568 --> 00:21:23.760\nwhy does that matter?\n\n410\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.340\nBecause at 100 megabit,\nwe don't use all eight wires.\n\n411\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.130\nWe only use two pairs, in other words,\nfour wires out of the eight wires here.\n\n412\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.540\nWe use two for sending and\nthen two for receiving.\n\n413\n00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:40.440\nAnd that is all based on the actual\ndevice that it's connected to,\n\n414\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.920\nwhich is normally gonna be\na network interface card.\n\n415\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.140\nThose cards are pinned out specificallyin\nthe way where they say, here's what we're\n\n416\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.820\ngoing to use for sending and\nhere's what we're gonna use for receiving.\n\n417\n00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.700\nSo that's why it's important\nthat we know this, okay.\n\n418\n00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.852\nIt really is going to be helpful for\nus to understand what goes on here, okay?\n\n419\n00:21:57.852 --> 00:22:01.902\nNow I put these devices also in\nthis place too, because I wanted\n\n420\n00:22:01.902 --> 00:22:07.420\nyou to know what devices are do we\nnormally use a straight through cable for.\n\n421\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.470\nSo for example, a PC to a switch.\n\n422\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.478\nWe'd use a straight through cable.\n\n423\n00:22:12.478 --> 00:22:16.370\nIf you have a switch to a router,\nyou use a straight through cable as well.\n\n424\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.097\nAnd that is all base on the network\ninterface cards that they connect to.\n\n425\n00:22:21.097 --> 00:22:24.620\nAnd that is a key part of what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n426\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.790\nSo that is what we'll also end up seeing.\n\n427\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.015\nNow that we,\nI'm trying to say what was I doing next\n\n428\n00:22:33.015 --> 00:22:33.590\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n429\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.114\n&gt;&gt; So now we have the understanding\n\n430\n00:22:35.114 --> 00:22:38.959\nof straight through cable, this is by far\nthe most common cable that we will buy.\n\n431\n00:22:38.959 --> 00:22:39.727\n&gt;&gt; You go to Best Buy,\n\n432\n00:22:39.727 --> 00:22:41.371\nyou grab a cable off the shelf.\n&gt;&gt; This is what you're gonna have, okay?\n\n433\n00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:42.829\n&gt;&gt; This is what you're gonna see.\n\n434\n00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:44.161\n&gt;&gt; Now the great thing is,\n\n435\n00:22:44.161 --> 00:22:46.850\nthere's also another type of cable.\n\n436\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.798\nAnd the actual great\nthing even about this,\n\n437\n00:22:48.798 --> 00:22:51.694\nis that today most of the Cisco switches,\njust about all of them,\n\n438\n00:22:51.694 --> 00:22:54.390\nI can't say every single one of them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n439\n00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.505\n&gt;&gt; Most of the Cisco switches do not care\n\n440\n00:22:56.505 --> 00:23:00.150\nwhether you use a cross over cable or\nwhether you use a straight through cable.\n\n441\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.727\nIf it needs a crossover cable it says,\nI can switch that internally and\n\n442\n00:23:03.727 --> 00:23:05.133\nI can make it what I need it.\n\n443\n00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:07.662\nSo it actually does work that way.\n&gt;&gt; Times have changed,\n\n444\n00:23:07.662 --> 00:23:10.598\nhaven't they?\n&gt;&gt; Now that actually works in every place\n\n445\n00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:13.730\nexam for the exam, so that's why we\nneed to learn this as well ,okay?\n\n446\n00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.690\nSo a crossover cable though, okay, you\nactually end up connecting pins one and\n\n447\n00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.040\ntwo which are normally the sending pins,\nthe transmission pins, and\n\n448\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.610\nyou are connecting them to\nthe receiving pins on the other side.\n\n449\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.392\nSo it's the same thing over\non the other side here.\n\n450\n00:23:30.392 --> 00:23:34.409\nYou are actually connecting the sending\npins to the receiving pins on this side of\n\n451\n00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:35.630\nthe cable.\n\n452\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.522\nAnd if you do it right,\nif you do it right,\n\n453\n00:23:38.522 --> 00:23:43.482\nwhat you should see is you is follow\none standard on one end and you follow\n\n454\n00:23:43.482 --> 00:23:49.210\nthe other standard on the other end, and\nthat gives you a proper crossover cable.\n\n455\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.803\nAnd that is because these devices and\nthe way that they're pinned down on their\n\n456\n00:23:52.803 --> 00:23:55.158\nnetwork interface cards,\nit makes a difference.\n\n457\n00:23:55.158 --> 00:23:58.711\nIf they're actually designed\nto send out on one and two.\n\n458\n00:23:58.711 --> 00:24:02.252\nThat means they're gonna actually\nreceive on three and six.\n\n459\n00:24:02.252 --> 00:24:05.924\nWell if I connect to another PC,\nand I use a straight through cable,\n\n460\n00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:09.250\nthat means I'm actually trying\nto transmit into, what?\n\n461\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.972\nA transmitting pin pair, okay.\n\n462\n00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:16.730\nSo we don't wanna do that,\nwhat we wanna do is if I connect for\n\n463\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:22.370\na PC to a PC directly, I want to send to\nthe receiving pins over on the other side.\n\n464\n00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.320\nSo that's gonna be very important\nthat we understand that, too, okay.\n\n465\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.110\nThe great thing is,\n\n466\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.310\nI believe if you do check out the Comptia\nnetwork plus, or A plus show.\n\n467\n00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.869\nI think Wes Brian actually breaks it down\nand actually creates one of these cables\n\n468\n00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:37.130\nfor you, so\nthat you can see how it actually works.\n\n469\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.220\nSo make sure you check that out.\n\n470\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.080\nNow the other one that you\ndefinitely need to pay attention to\n\n471\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.550\nis going to be this one.\n\n472\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.320\nThis one looks like it's all\nin a complete 100% mess here.\n\n473\n00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.180\nNow on a crossover cable,\nthis one will work and\n\n474\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.900\nthe straight through cable\nwill work on gigabit.\n\n475\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.040\nBut in a crossover cable, you need\nto also remember this, is that we've\n\n476\n00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.790\nalso changed pairs four and five because\nit uses all eight wires in gigabit here.\n\n477\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.290\nSo in this instance here,\nyou'll also take pins four and\n\n478\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:17.570\nfive, and directly connect them to\nseven and eight on the other side.\n\n479\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.830\nSo let me add that back in here.\n\n480\n00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.989\nOops, let me try and\nadd that back in here.\n\n481\n00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.515\nSo now we also have\ntransmissions on four and five.\n\n482\n00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.085\nAnd then, we would actually connect\nthem over here to the receiving side.\n\n483\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:45.509\nWhich would be seven and eight, which I\ncan't remember, I don't know why, okay.\n\n484\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.500\nSo on the gigabit it is going\nto be different to do this.\n\n485\n00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.180\nSo you wanna make sure that you understand\nthat connection as well when you're\n\n486\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.300\nactually told that you need to choose\nwhat devices that these things go in to.\n\n487\n00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.380\nSo understanding those particular\nconnections are going to be key\n\n488\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.330\nhere, okay.\n\n489\n00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.000\nSo make sure you understand where you\nwould end up using a cross over cable.\n\n490\n00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.962\nWe've already said when it's\nthe same device to the same device,\n\n491\n00:26:12.962 --> 00:26:14.860\nyou can use a cross over cable.\n\n492\n00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.400\nIf you're actually connecting\nto a different device,\n\n493\n00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.230\na router to a switch, okay.\n\n494\n00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.815\nAnd you might go how\nthe heck does that work?\n\n495\n00:26:21.815 --> 00:26:24.650\nRemember that a router will\nwork at layer three, and\n\n496\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.350\na switch will work at layer two.\n\n497\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.960\nWhen you have something like that,\nyou're gonna use a straight through cable.\n\n498\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.430\nBut a switch to switch, that's layer two,\nyou're gonna use a crossover cable.\n\n499\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.360\nRouter to router,\nyou're gonna use a crossover cable.\n\n500\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.660\nA router essentially is\njust a basic computer.\n\n501\n00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.920\nSo if you actually connect a PC\nto a router, which you can,\n\n502\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.850\nyou're gonna need a cross over cable for\nthe exam.\n\n503\n00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:50.220\nSo those are kind of the key elements\nthere in getting prepared and ready for\n\n504\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.800\nthe exam as well.\n\n505\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.300\nThere is one other cable that\nwe really want to stress and\n\n506\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.790\nshow you, which is right here, okay?\n\n507\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.930\nThere is one other cable that we're gonna\nend up using when we start talking about\n\n508\n00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:10.510\nCisco configuration explicitly here, which\nis gonna be the idea of a rollover cable.\n\n509\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:16.640\nA rollover cable is exactly like it\nsounds, pins 1 through 8 on this side,\n\n510\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.950\nthey actually start a pens 8 all the way\ndown through 1 on the other side here.\n\n511\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.400\nUsually this is called a console cable,\nand then that console cable,\n\n512\n00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.620\nlet me see if I can just show you\non just by holding it up here.\n\n513\n00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.080\nSo on my screen here,\n\n514\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.880\nthis is what a general console\ncable ends up looking like.\n\n515\n00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.270\nIt's light blue,\nthere's a RJ45 connector on this side.\n\n516\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.933\nThere is also, of course,\nan RS232 connector on this side.\n\n517\n00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:44.310\nA problem that I have, Daniel, is simple.\n\n518\n00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.390\nI don't have an RS232\non my laptop anymore.\n\n519\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n520\n00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:53.005\nsome of the newer Cisco devices\nare coming with the rollover to like USB,\n\n521\n00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:53.844\ncorrect?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n522\n00:27:53.844 --> 00:27:57.294\nyeah it's not only just to USB anymore,\nit's even to the micro or\n\n523\n00:27:57.294 --> 00:27:58.493\nmini USB ones too.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n524\n00:27:58.493 --> 00:28:00.677\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you'll actually see that instead.\n\n525\n00:28:00.677 --> 00:28:02.815\nSo you just kind of have to pay attention.\n\n526\n00:28:02.815 --> 00:28:07.065\nUsually for Cisco, it's this color right\nhere that matters more than anything else.\n\n527\n00:28:07.065 --> 00:28:10.735\nI have an older one, cuz this is the one\nfrom like an early router that I ever got.\n\n528\n00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:14.410\nBut as I continue to actually\nupgrade I didn't change over,\n\n529\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.070\nbecause I never got a new one.\n\n530\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.800\nSo I just added in this USB\nto RS232 connector, and\n\n531\n00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.340\nmade sure that I could connect\nto it using that console cable.\n\n532\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.010\nSo this is one of these things that you\nend up carrying around in your backpack\n\n533\n00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.170\nas you work on Cisco devices.\n\n534\n00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.920\nBecause if you ever need to,\nthat's probably the most direct\n\n535\n00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.640\nway to get access to your Cisco device,\nas well, okay?\n\n536\n00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.030\nSo, that's kind of the big\ninstances of that particular cable.\n\n537\n00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:46.290\nNow, there are a few different standards\nyou want to also pay attention to as well.\n\n538\n00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.840\nIt's not so much about Cat 3\nall the way through 4 here.\n\n539\n00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.095\nI just added this in for completeness.\n\n540\n00:28:52.095 --> 00:28:56.630\nBut most of the time in today's networks,\nyou're gonna see Cat 5e and\n\n541\n00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.350\nCat 6 cable today.\n\n542\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.151\nAnd notice both of them\nare considered Gigabit Ethernet, okay.\n\n543\n00:29:02.151 --> 00:29:06.927\nThe differences between these have to do\nwith the frequency, the megahertz that's\n\n544\n00:29:06.927 --> 00:29:11.840\nactually sent down these cables here,\nabout how much can actually be there.\n\n545\n00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.628\nIf you're using copper, remember that\nthe maximum distance limitation on\n\n546\n00:29:16.628 --> 00:29:20.382\ntwisted pair is gonna be 100 meters or\n328 feet here.\n\n547\n00:29:20.382 --> 00:29:24.309\nThe regular outside jack ending this\ncable, this is a great reminder,\n\n548\n00:29:24.309 --> 00:29:26.666\nis normally PVC, polyvinyl chloride, or\n\n549\n00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:31.263\nit's gonna be plenum grade cabling which\nis not PVC because that runs in the walls.\n\n550\n00:29:31.263 --> 00:29:34.543\nAnd if you burn PVC it\ntends to eat your lungs, so\n\n551\n00:29:34.543 --> 00:29:39.135\nfire departments do not like it when\nyou run non plenum grade cables\n\n552\n00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:44.350\ninside of walls when there's a fire\nbecause it eats their lungs.\n\n553\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.054\nSo yeah, it's very bad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's bad.\n\n554\n00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:50.080\n&gt;&gt; t's really bad, so, pay attention here.\n\n555\n00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.990\nSo remember, I just put this for\nthe sake of completeness.\n\n556\n00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.820\nBut make sure you pay attention\nto at least Cat 5e and 6, and\n\n557\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.800\nunderstand that usually those\nare the ones you'll end up seeing.\n\n558\n00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.911\nMost of the time, these are gonna\nbe marked on the cable themselves.\n\n559\n00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:08.500\nThey're gonna be laser etched in there,\nwhether it's Cat 5e or 6.\n\n560\n00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.160\nThey both will function, but\njust kind of remember that\n\n561\n00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.410\nthat's really kind of the big\ndifference in terms of implementation.\n\n562\n00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:20.120\nOkay, now once you actually have that,\nthat will probably kind of\n\n563\n00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.770\nround out everything that you need in\nterms of just regular networking cables.\n\n564\n00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:27.040\nNow are there other types of\ncables you're likely to run into?\n\n565\n00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.310\nYes, you'd better believe it.\n\n566\n00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.200\nRight here at ITProTV\n\n567\n00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.100\nwe use a lot of coax cable.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n\n568\n00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.890\n&gt;&gt; Miles of coax cable is what it\n\n569\n00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.010\nactually looks like.\n\n570\n00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.550\nComing from our control center out there,\nall the way back to our server cloud.\n\n571\n00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.850\nIt looks like miles of that cable.\n\n572\n00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:44.750\nBut the overall result, most of the people\ntoday, we don't do coax networking for\n\n573\n00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.230\ncomputers very often anymore.\n\n574\n00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.410\nBut you still will find\nimplementation of them,\n\n575\n00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.680\nsuch as in our production\nstudio right here.\n\n576\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.520\nSo don't think that they're\ncompletely gone, they aren't.\n\n577\n00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.120\nBut we don't really worry about it,\nin terms of networking standards,\n\n578\n00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.950\nat least preparing for Cisco.\n\n579\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:58.582\nBut Daniel,\n\n580\n00:30:58.582 --> 00:31:02.211\nthere's one last thing that we have to\nmake sure that we understand and do.\n\n581\n00:31:02.211 --> 00:31:04.374\nSo, even though it's a few minutes over,\n\n582\n00:31:04.374 --> 00:31:08.620\nhere let's make sure that we get\nthis down at this point, okay.\n\n583\n00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.610\nOnce again on the exam,\nI can't tell you that this is what\n\n584\n00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.150\nyou'll actually end up seeing or not.\n&gt;&gt; Place\n\n585\n00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.180\nthe correct cable to the correct device.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, Daniel.\n\n586\n00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.540\nSo there you go, so you might\nactually have something like this\n\n587\n00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.760\nwhere they might actually go ahead and\nfill out every other one for\n\n588\n00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.360\nyou except for the one that you\nneed to actually understand.\n\n589\n00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.100\nSo, at this point here, so\nlet's say that we do this.\n\n590\n00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.740\nSo let's say that they help us out here.\n\n591\n00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.740\nI’m gonna make a copy of my\ncrossover cable here, and\n\n592\n00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:42.020\nI’m gonna put it in between\nthese two devices like this.\n\n593\n00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:46.410\nSo Daniel, if I was asked to fill\nout the rest of these, okay?\n\n594\n00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.788\nSo let's say that at this point here,\nthat they say, hey,\n\n595\n00:31:50.788 --> 00:31:55.880\nwhat would you actually use to\nconnect the server over to the switch?\n\n596\n00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.068\nWould it be a straight-through or\na crossover?\n\n597\n00:31:58.068 --> 00:31:59.794\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with a straight-through.\n\n598\n00:31:59.794 --> 00:32:00.895\n&gt;&gt; Straight-through cable.\n\n599\n00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:02.358\nYou are correct.\n\n600\n00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:03.933\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n\n601\n00:32:03.933 --> 00:32:05.035\n&gt;&gt; So that actually does make sense,\n\n602\n00:32:05.035 --> 00:32:07.245\nI know it's very difficult for Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; It's been a while, man,\n\n603\n00:32:07.245 --> 00:32:09.830\nit's been a while.\n&gt;&gt; As he's feigning that, he's like,\n\n604\n00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.220\nRonnie, are you really\nasking me that question?\n\n605\n00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.920\nYes I am.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n606\n00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.030\nare crazy sir.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n607\n00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.640\nare crazy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n608\n00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.790\n&gt;&gt; But I am asking that question.\n\n609\n00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.940\nNow, the only one that could be a little\nbit confusing, usually for most people,\n\n610\n00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.098\nis right here, okay.\n\n611\n00:32:21.098 --> 00:32:25.490\nSo this is where you have to\nread the question, Dan, okay.\n\n612\n00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.410\nThe reason why is if they\nsay you need to connect,\n\n613\n00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:33.150\nlet's say, your RS-232 to the router.\n\n614\n00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.510\nWell now, Daniel,\nwhich one would you actually choose?\n\n615\n00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.520\n&gt;&gt; That would be the rollover.\n\n616\n00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that would\n\n617\n00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.940\nbe the rollover cable, okay.\n\n618\n00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.100\nSo could you actually use\na cross over cable here?\n\n619\n00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.240\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n\n620\n00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.890\n&gt;&gt; But it's not actually meeting\n\n621\n00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.090\nthe specific requirement of what you\nmight actually end up being asked about.\n\n622\n00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.626\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n623\n00:32:50.626 --> 00:32:53.980\ncuz they might ask you to SSH into a box.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n624\n00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.960\n&gt;&gt; And it's only\n\n625\n00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.200\na router and a PC.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n626\n00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.120\n&gt;&gt; How would you do that?\n\n627\n00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:02.440\nWell, you would need the, so\na straight through cable for\n\n628\n00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:07.112\nthat, or is it crossover?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it depends on [CROSSTALK].\n\n629\n00:33:07.112 --> 00:33:09.694\nYou actually need that crossover,\nyeah, that crossover.\n\n630\n00:33:09.694 --> 00:33:11.480\nYou're starting to confuse me, Dan.\n\n631\n00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.536\nYou're killing me.\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy.\n\n632\n00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:13.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n633\n00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:18.730\nBut just kind of remember that\nthis is not, I really can't say\n\n634\n00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.240\nthis is 100% what you're gonna see on\nthe exam, because I can't guarantee that.\n\n635\n00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.360\nI couldn't guarantee that if I wanted to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n636\n00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.215\n&gt;&gt; But overall though,\n\n637\n00:33:25.215 --> 00:33:29.730\nit's not uncommon where you need\nto select the right cable for\n\n638\n00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.630\nthe right devices to be\nable to connect in to.\n\n639\n00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.700\nSo even though today, when you\ndon't have to worry about it, okay,\n\n640\n00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.100\nthat's called Auto MDIX or Auto MDX.\n\n641\n00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.590\nBut on the exam though, they're gonna ask\nyou to select the right cable, and for\n\n642\n00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.845\nthe exam you can't just say,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n643\n00:33:47.845 --> 00:33:50.900\nCuz they'll show you a regular\nstraight through cable, and\n\n644\n00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.950\nyou go,\nthat'll work between these two switches.\n\n645\n00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.610\nYes, in reality it will.\n\n646\n00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.603\nBut on the exam if you see crossover cable\nat that point, they wanna know if you\n\n647\n00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:02.118\nactually understand that that's\nthe cable it should actually be.\n\n648\n00:34:02.118 --> 00:34:05.620\nAnd that's the key here,\nokay, so that's the idea.\n\n649\n00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.310\nMake sure you pay attention to it as you\ncontinue to study for your CSET, but\n\n650\n00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.290\nthat will kind of give you a basic\noverview in terms of cabling\n\n651\n00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.730\nthat you need to understand.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Ronnie, great overview.\n\n652\n00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.010\nI got a lot out of it, I'm starting to\nremember things that I had forgotten,\n\n653\n00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.000\ncuz it's been a little bit since\nI've actually done some networking.\n\n654\n00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.400\nSo I appreciate you for that, Ronnie.\n\n655\n00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.700\nAnd I'm sure you good folks out there as\nwell, hopefully you got a lot out of this.\n\n656\n00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.790\nAnd yeah, while the networking\nequipment in today's episode,\n\n657\n00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:34.240\nwell the Cisco equipment, and by and\nlarge, will do some changeroo for you.\n\n658\n00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.460\nIf you put the wrong cable in, it goes,\nit needs to be this and it does it.\n\n659\n00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.340\nThat's not always the case cuz\nI'm sure in older equipment,\n\n660\n00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.460\nyou're in legacy equipment, and\nyou have to know which one is there.\n\n661\n00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.090\nSo it is still pertinent for\nus to be able to do that very thing.\n\n662\n00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.340\nRonnie, thanks for dropping by,\nwe appreciate you as always.\n\n663\n00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.050\nWe appreciate you good\nfolks out there as well.\n\n664\n00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.510\nBut we're gonna go ahead and call it.\n\n665\n00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.610\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n666\n00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n667\n00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.695\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n668\n00:34:57.695 -->

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.590\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\nyou Cisco CCENT series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.860\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.650\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat how to understand IP Version 4\n\n8\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.840\naddressing and who better to explain\nthis topic than Mr. Ronnie Wong himself?\n\n9\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.180\nThanks so much for stopping by, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.120\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.170\n&gt;&gt; Fine.\nThank you Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.390\nThank you for having me on the show as we\ncontinue to learn a little bit more of\n\n13\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.420\ncourse about networking fundamentals.\n\n14\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.020\nAnd we are at this point in our series.\n\n15\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.890\nWell, we now have to start taking\na look at a logical side of things,\n\n16\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.300\nin the way that networking,\nof course, works.\n\n17\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.310\nNow, we've already talked about\ndesign processes a little bit, and\n\n18\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.400\nwe talked about the basics in a course,\nThe fundamentals of Networking Theory.\n\n19\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.390\nAnd now we're heading into the actual\nimplementation of several things and\n\n20\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.900\none of the key elements behind\nnetworking of course is for\n\n21\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.360\nus to make sure that we understand\nwhen IP version 4 address is and\n\n22\n00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.920\nof course how that actually\nimplies in the networking as well.\n\n23\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.490\nNow before we get started there Cherokee\nwe need to actually think about the idea\n\n24\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.260\nof that there's different address types\nthat we have to be familiar with.\n\n25\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.680\nSo not all IP addresses are actually\ncreated equal in that sense.\n\n26\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.180\nThere are some addresses that will work\nand help us out in different situations.\n\n27\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.330\nSo that's what we're gonna address\nright here at the beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.210\nAnd then we'll kind of\nchange our focus and\n\n29\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.975\ngo into the realm of\nIP Version 4 addressing.\n\n30\n00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:35.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay Ronnie, so what type of IP\naddressing are we gonna start with?\n\n31\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's take\na look at my screen for a moment.\n\n32\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.380\nWe're just gonna take notes because\nthat's kind of the easiest way\n\n33\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.820\nto make sure that we cover\nwhat we need here, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.950\nSo there's actually gonna be\nseveral different ones, but for\n\n35\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.290\nus there's three primary\ndifferent types of IP addresses.\n\n36\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.480\nI was gonna say Ikea address,\nwhich is something totally different so\n\n37\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.690\nIP address is what we call\nunicast addresses, okay.\n\n38\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.670\nAnd then there is also what\nwe call a broadcast address,\n\n39\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.230\nand then there is what we call\nmulticast addresses as well, okay.\n\n40\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.560\nSo that's what we're actually taking, and\n\n41\n00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.110\nit looks like I've kind of\nmisspelled everything here.\n\n42\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.930\nSo let's talk about the first\none here just briefly, okay.\n\n43\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.630\nSo when we start taking a look at\nthe idea of a unicast address,\n\n44\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.040\nCherokee, let's make sure that we\nunderstand what this means, okay.\n\n45\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.620\nSo the term unicast, the term cast\njust means like just throwing it out,\n\n46\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.212\nall right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:34.050\nAt least that's\nthe Ronnie Wong definition.\n\n48\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.959\n&gt;&gt; Fishing.\n\n49\n00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah fishing, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:40.400\nUni, which would be-\n&gt;&gt; Unicycle, unicon.\n\n51\n00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.466\n&gt;&gt; Unicon, okay, unicon.\n\n52\n00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:42.966\n&gt;&gt; Uni.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:44.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.096\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so yeah,\n\n55\n00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:46.690\nthere goes the unicon.\nI don't know how that fits in there.\n\n56\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.410\nBut sure-\n\n57\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Only one horn.\n\n58\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.970\n&gt;&gt; Only one horn.\n\n59\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.000\nNow that you've said that,\n\n60\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.180\nI understand now.\n\n61\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.210\nSo there it is, unicast address here.\n\n62\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.950\nSo what is a unicast address?\n\n63\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.480\nWell, for us, when we start taking\na look at the idea of a unicast address,\n\n64\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.740\ntechnically the easiest way\nto describe this is that for\n\n65\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.920\nus this is gonna be a single IP address.\n\n66\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.010\nNow that single IP address could be\nwhat we call the Source IP address\n\n67\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.040\nor the Destination IP Address.\n\n68\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.290\nSo what is that about?\n\n69\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.740\nThat is that if we need to\nsend data from one place, one,\n\n70\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.160\nto another place,\nthen we're gonna use a unicast address.\n\n71\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.960\nThis type of address for us when we\nstart to do this, we communicate.\n\n72\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.090\nThe majority of the communications\nthat we tend to do\n\n73\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.890\nis gonna be a unicast type of address.\n\n74\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.150\n&gt;&gt; So I'm taking my little note.\n\n75\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.440\nI'm folding it up into my little origami.\n\n76\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.885\nHooking it onto my hook.\n\n77\n00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.280\n[LAUGH] Hooking it onto my hook.\n\n78\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n79\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.380\ncast my unicast message out to you.\n\n80\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.660\nSo Point A to Point B, you're receiving.\n\n81\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.330\n&gt;&gt; Point A, yeah.\n\n82\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.670\nPoint A to Point B,\nthat's actually a good one, okay.\n\n83\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.990\nSo A to B is actually a good definition\nfor us to actually think about.\n\n84\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.200\nNow the reason why this is important is\nbecause if we don't have this unicast\n\n85\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.760\naddress, and we now just go ahead and\nsend our data outbound.\n\n86\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.790\nThere is a chance that it means that\nnobody else is going to hear that message\n\n87\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.010\nand then if somebody does hear that\nmessage, they're gonna reply back.\n\n88\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.970\nThey're not gonna know how\nto reply back too as well.\n\n89\n00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.350\nSo, usually when we start doing this, ok?\n\n90\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.898\nThe other terminology that we use here is\nalso what we call a one to one addressing.\n\n91\n00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:38.370\nSomething source to destination address\nis pretty much what we will see.\n\n92\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.190\nEvery packet that a source sends, then as\nwe remember the encapsulation that we have\n\n93\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.400\nbeen talking about throughout\nthe entire series, right?\n\n94\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.650\nWhen we get down to that layer\nthree in the OSI model all right?\n\n95\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.930\nInto the internet layer and\nthe TCPIP model all right?\n\n96\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.250\nThat is the addressing\nthat we are talking about.\n\n97\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.080\nThat the source will have one IP address\nand its destination address will also\n\n98\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.370\nbe a single address that is actually\ndesigned for some other devices.\n\n99\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.900\nThat means all the other devices\nwill not process this data.\n\n100\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.380\nSo, it is pretty much the one we\ntend to use where we actually are.\n\n101\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.170\nThe key here, in a unicast address\nbecause there can be multiple\n\n102\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.790\ndevices that are within,\nwhat we call, the same subnet,\n\n103\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.350\nwhich a subnet is essentially a logical\ngrouping of network addresses, right?\n\n104\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.240\nSo is that these have to be unique.\n\n105\n00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.345\nThey must be unique within\n\n106\n00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:44.009\nthe same network or subnet.\n\n107\n00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:51.449\nAll right, so\nrather this is our logical rooting of\n\n108\n00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.080\naddresses which is the idea of subnets.\n\n109\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.380\nSo that means I should\nnot have any duplicates.\n\n110\n00:06:00.946 --> 00:06:02.726\nNo duplicates.\n\n111\n00:06:06.022 --> 00:06:10.780\nAll right, within the same subnet, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.650\nNow as an example of that, right,\nas we start to take a look at this, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.476\nSo there should not be 192.168 1.0 or\n1.- I should say zero.\n\n114\n00:06:21.476 --> 00:06:24.059\n1.100 we shouldn't see two of these.\n\n115\n00:06:25.314 --> 00:06:29.550\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie that is like your prefacing\nhere only within the same subnet.\n\n116\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.920\nSo theoretically, you and\nI could both have the same IP addresses\n\n117\n00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.270\nIf we are on the separate networks I\ndidn't even know which other existed.\n\n118\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.000\nSo there is a difference there.\n\n119\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.340\nBut can't have them on the same segment.\n\n120\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Right and\nthat's gonna be important as well.\n\n121\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.320\nSo there's no duplicate of\nsomething like this as our example.\n\n122\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.010\nAnd that's gonna be key.\n\n123\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.200\nWe can not send and\nreceive that at the same time.\n\n124\n00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.790\nSo in otehr words in other machines.\n\n125\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.270\nThat machine and this is their\nsending IP address as the source\n\n126\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.750\nthen the destination it can back\nto them but that would be silly.\n\n127\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.010\nBut another machine shouldn't have that\nsame address is what we're saying.\n\n128\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.730\n&gt;&gt; And there isn't a function if we were\ntrying to have something come back to us,\n\n129\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.190\nyou would use the loop back address for\nthat specific use case.\n\n130\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now the other thing about\nthis which we want to also emphasize\n\n131\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.410\nthat in the realm of TCPIP networks, okay,\n\n132\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.530\ntypically this is where we\ntend to see a TCP trap.\n\n133\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.710\nOkay, so if you actually have to make and\n\n134\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.210\nestablish if you remember we went\nover the idea of the TCP protocol.\n\n135\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.740\nIt is connection oriented protocol\nthat means that the sender or\n\n136\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.800\nthe source and the destination, they have\nto be synced up before they send any data.\n\n137\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.180\nWell, that's why the unicast address also\nis usually gonna be TCP type of data.\n\n138\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI get that acknowledgement.\n\n139\n00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.180\nI know you received my message, Ronnie,\nyou're just choosing to ignore me.\n\n140\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.140\nThat could be true-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.799\n&gt;&gt; That does happen, but not normally.\n\n142\n00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:58.460\nSo here we go, so\nunicast addresses really are helpful.\n\n143\n00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.097\nBecause this is usually the direct\nmessage that we want to send.\n\n144\n00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:06.231\nEverybody wants to make sure that\nthe sender gets data to the receiver and\n\n145\n00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:08.290\nnot to everybody else, all right?\n\n146\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.160\nNow there is an opportunity though\nin which you may want to communicate\n\n147\n00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.010\ndirectly with everyone else as well, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.580\nNow there are also what we call\nbroadcast types of traffic and\n\n149\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.824\nbroadcast addresses as well, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:27.160\nNow a broadcast address is\nactually a special address, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.618\nSo even though it normally is\na single IP address, okay,\n\n152\n00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:35.270\nis special, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.678\nAnd what do I mean by being special here.\n\n154\n00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:42.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Is it's not assigned to any\n\n155\n00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:48.400\none, Device, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.415\nSo I can't take a broadcast\naddress of a subnet, and\n\n157\n00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:55.255\nput that onto Cherokee's machine.\n\n158\n00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:55.861\nIf I do that,\n\n159\n00:08:55.861 --> 00:09:00.050\nCherokee's machine's not going to respond\nin the way that we want it to, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.470\nSo that broadcast address is a special IP\naddress that is normally not assigned to\n\n161\n00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.930\na device or what we call a host, it is\nactually an address that's out there.\n\n162\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.035\nNow the other thing that's\nspecial about this, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:17.439\nIs that a broadcast address is kind of\nan unusual address in this sense, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:23.282\nEvery device, Within a subnet,\n\n165\n00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:32.529\nListens, For traffic,\n\n166\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.630\nSent to the broadcast address, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.650\nNow that means that when\nI am the receiver, or\n\n168\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.560\nCherokee is the destination\nmachine in a unicast, right?\n\n169\n00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.560\nWell we know,\nbecause it has her IP address on it.\n\n170\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.370\nBut the other thing that also happens on\nher computer is that it not only listens\n\n171\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.680\nfor then unicast traffic going\nto Cherokee's computer, but\n\n172\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.200\nit also listens for\nbroadcast traffic as well.\n\n173\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Ronnie, I have a daughter\nwho's in kindergarten, and\n\n174\n00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.770\nI recently was in her classroom.\n\n175\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.627\nAnd that means there were a lot of\nother kindergarteners in there,\n\n176\n00:10:09.627 --> 00:10:10.858\nwith their parents as well.\n\n177\n00:10:10.858 --> 00:10:13.276\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of chatter, a lot of talk.\n\n178\n00:10:13.276 --> 00:10:17.350\nIf I have to listen to everyone,\nthat can be a little much at times, right?\n\n179\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.450\nSo is that what we're looking at here?\n\n180\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.420\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.320\nSo, the idea of a broadcast address,\nit really does,\n\n182\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.760\nit goes out to everyone at one time.\n\n183\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.930\nSo when we actually start\nto send this here, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.957\nThis is us trying to communicate\nto everyone at the same time so\n\n185\n00:10:34.957 --> 00:10:37.963\nyou may hear also the term One to ALL.\n\n186\n00:10:37.963 --> 00:10:42.585\nSo if I wanted to send the message out\njust like I would in a crowded room,\n\n187\n00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:47.230\nI can just tell everybody or\nyell to everybody, please listen, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.070\nNow if there's actually everybody talking\nin broadcast, that means it's gonna\n\n189\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:57.060\nget very loud, and in older networks\nthis used to be the problem here.\n\n190\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.870\nBecause this actually also gives us that\nidea of what we call a broadcast domain.\n\n191\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:07.240\nThat is, how many people are listening\nto this broadcast address at one time?\n\n192\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.294\nSo that's the way it is.\n\n193\n00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:12.224\nAnd it used to be where all the traffic\nessentially was a broadcast type of\n\n194\n00:11:12.224 --> 00:11:13.420\ntraffic.\n\n195\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.250\nAnd you just had to listen for it and make\nsure that you were the one that heard it.\n\n196\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.340\nEverybody else but us should kind of\ndrop off if they didn't actually see\n\n197\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.300\nthe information was designed for them.\n\n198\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.150\nBut this is actually the key here.\n\n199\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.255\nNow in broadcasting here, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:27.255 --> 00:11:31.161\nThe other thing here is that this is\nactually a UDP the majority of the time as\n\n201\n00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:32.360\nwell, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.270\nSo broadcast address actually\nhelped us to do that.\n\n203\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.720\nNow does this mean that\nit's bad all the time?\n\n204\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.460\nWell it does cause for a noisy network,\nbecause if every protocol that we\n\n205\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.850\nuse within networks is always broadcast,\nthat's a lot of traffic going out not\n\n206\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.080\nmeant for everyone, but really let's\nsay just meant for Cherokee's computer.\n\n207\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.370\nSo instead, it does provide them,\neverybody has to at least shut it out or\n\n208\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.510\ndrop the packets, and that's where you\nstart having some other issues too.\n\n209\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.760\n&gt;&gt; But I mean, if you're in a noisy room\nand there was a fire and you yell out\n\n210\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.790\nfire, it could efficient in a sense that\nhey, everybody heard it, they're aware.\n\n211\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.920\nLet's take action.\n\n212\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, so some of the protocols\nthat are used out there,\n\n213\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.130\nthey are still using and relying on\nthings like broadcast to help them out.\n\n214\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.760\nBut in reality though, because of\nthe way that networks are today,\n\n215\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.950\na lot of broadcast traffic is relatively\nlimited to only a few things.\n\n216\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.050\nBut not everything, there's actually\na protocol running around on our network\n\n217\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.230\nright now, cuz we have so\nmany Apple devices.\n\n218\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.403\nAnd I can't remember what is called,\nAirPlay or\n\n219\n00:12:33.403 --> 00:12:35.075\nsomething-\n&gt;&gt; AppleTalk?\n\n220\n00:12:35.075 --> 00:12:37.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might be yeah,\nno it's not AppleTalk.\n\n221\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.600\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n222\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.239\n&gt;&gt; But there's some other\none that's out there and\n\n223\n00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:42.821\nyou can see it's all\nbroadcast on our network.\n\n224\n00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:43.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n225\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.402\n&gt;&gt; So it does happen that there are some\nmessages that are just completely\n\n226\n00:12:46.402 --> 00:12:47.507\nbroadcast as they happen.\n\n227\n00:12:47.507 --> 00:12:52.064\n&gt;&gt; And we were talking about IPv4, so\nyou do see some protocols like ARP and\n\n228\n00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:55.600\nDHCP that still rely on\nbroadcast communication.\n\n229\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.140\nMoving to IPv6, not the same case,\nbut we're not there yet.\n\n230\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.544\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so that's actually good, so let's\nsay ARP, and then what did you say, DHCP?\n\n231\n00:13:04.544 --> 00:13:05.324\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n232\n00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:06.304\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, yeah.\n\n233\n00:13:06.304 --> 00:13:10.090\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, so it does,\nDHCP does broadcast address as well.\n\n234\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.620\nSo these are two important address\ntypes that you'll also see.\n\n235\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.261\nThe third one is probably the one that's\nmore confusing for a lot of people that\n\n236\n00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:22.354\nare new to networking,\nwhich is called a multicast address, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:22.354 --> 00:13:27.005\nNow for us in terms of\na multicast address, all right?\n\n238\n00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:32.292\nThis is unusual because it's not really a\nunicast, but it's not a broadcast either.\n\n239\n00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:36.959\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So neither unicast or broadcast,\n\n240\n00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:40.660\nis kind of a neat way to\nactually think about it.\n\n241\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Only my inner circle.\n\n242\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:42.993\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n243\n00:13:42.993 --> 00:13:45.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Only your\nspecial group of friends here,\n\n244\n00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:49.580\nas you start to take a look and\nyou start to do this, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.290\nSo this is actually neither of them, but\nit's essentially a subset of a broadcast.\n\n246\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.620\nSubset of a broadcast.\n\n247\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:06.950\nSo this is also known as a one\nto many type of address as well.\n\n248\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.270\nSo this type of address,\n\n249\n00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.111\nit really is starting to\nreplace a lot of the broadcast.\n\n250\n00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:17.990\nSo it's not everything actually needs\na broadcast to go out across the network.\n\n251\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.120\nWell, there may be multiple\ndevices though that need it.\n\n252\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.416\nSo what is it?\n\n253\n00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:27.080\nWhy aren't we able to except by\nusing something like multicast?\n\n254\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.120\nOr why shouldn't we be able to,\n\n255\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.580\nI should say, to actually contact\njust the devices that need it?\n\n256\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.400\nAnd say, here's the devices that need it.\n\n257\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.120\nWell if you're doing like I did when\nI first started off I thought well,\n\n258\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.570\nwhy don't just use unicast?\n\n259\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.419\nWhy not just concentrate each, or\n\n260\n00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:45.134\ncall upon each one of those six\ncomputers that I need to get access to?\n\n261\n00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n262\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.670\n&gt;&gt; And just send them Unicast traffic?.\n\n263\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.230\nWell let's think about it this way,\nCherokee, instead.\n\n264\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.807\nWe now understand that there's unicast\nwhere I send directly from me to you.\n\n265\n00:14:53.807 --> 00:14:57.780\nWe also understand broadcast me to\neverybody else in the room if we're just\n\n266\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.438\ntalking here, we can do that.\n\n267\n00:14:59.438 --> 00:15:04.290\nBut a multicast address though is\nalso different in this way, okay?\n\n268\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.877\nThan the idea of six unicast addresses.\n\n269\n00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:11.687\nIf there were six people, or six computers\nthere, that means that identical\n\n270\n00:15:11.687 --> 00:15:17.000\ntraffic that I would send to you has to\nbe sent once again to the other five.\n\n271\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.720\nSo that's five sets of duplicate data\nto each one of those connections.\n\n272\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.460\nA multicast is different in this way.\n\n273\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.096\nWe send out the traffic one time, and\n\n274\n00:15:28.096 --> 00:15:32.021\nthose six addresses just respond to it or\nthey hear it.\n\n275\n00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:36.544\nSo the transmission in terms of cost,\nor the mountain of transmission is one\n\n276\n00:15:36.544 --> 00:15:39.880\ntransmission that\neverybody just taps into.\n\n277\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.420\nNow if we want to actually take\na look at this as an example.\n\n278\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.950\nIf you think about the idea of pay per\nview, so if you like UFC fighting which\n\n279\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.840\nI'm pretty sure Cherokee does, I'm joking,\nI don't even know if she does or not.\n\n280\n00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.640\nBut let say it's something like that,\nright?\n\n281\n00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.500\nWell if she buys into that pay per view,\nwell they're only what?\n\n282\n00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.158\nThey're transmitting one time But\nCherokee's able to join in and\n\n283\n00:16:00.158 --> 00:16:02.150\nwatch the fight if she wants to.\n\n284\n00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.980\nI'm able to.\nThat doesn't mean it goes out to\n\n285\n00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.070\neverybody at the same time.\n\n286\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Only those people who-\n&gt;&gt; Paid for it.\n\n287\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.928\n&gt;&gt; Forked over the money, yeah.\n\n288\n00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:09.590\n&gt;&gt; They forked over the money.\n\n289\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I actually ended up paying for\n\n290\n00:16:12.086 --> 00:16:13.048\nsomething like this.\n\n291\n00:16:13.048 --> 00:16:17.270\nSo these are kind of the most common\ntypes of addressing traffic that we're\n\n292\n00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.620\nactually seeing or\naddress types that you'll see.\n\n293\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.240\nNow we didn't get super specific.\n\n294\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.690\nThe only time I even mentioned an IP\naddress was really up here, but\n\n295\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.210\nthere are some special addresses in which\n\n296\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.610\nwe'll take a look at each one\nof these a little bit later on\n\n297\n00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:36.450\nas we continue to work through the idea\nof understanding what IP addresses are.\n\n298\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.770\nBut you do need to be able to identify\nthe difference between a unicast,\n\n299\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.100\nbetween a broadcast, as well as a\nmulticast type of traffic that we may see,\n\n300\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.850\nas well as the addresses.\n\n301\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.630\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, we're talking\nabout IP addresses, are there\n\n302\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.380\nany other types of addresses that we\nneed to be familiar with at this level?\n\n303\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.400\n&gt;&gt; There really is.\n\n304\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.220\nSo the whole goal behind IP addresses,\n\n305\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.610\nreally does stem from a couple\nof different things here.\n\n306\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.740\nAnd let me go ahead and\njust create a new document for us.\n\n307\n00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.520\nLet me save this here just in case\nsomebody would like these notes.\n\n308\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.170\nSo we will call this Address Types.\n\n309\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:16.790\nAddress types just do that and I'll save\nthem inside the My downloads folder.\n\n310\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.068\nI hope I remember that at some point.\n\n311\n00:17:18.068 --> 00:17:21.905\n[LAUGH] I'm just going to open up,\nI may not remember-\n\n312\n00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:24.633\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's why we have rewind.\n\n313\n00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:27.550\n&gt;&gt; So in terms of addresses.\n\n314\n00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.590\nWe need to understand that\nwhole goal of addressing first.\n\n315\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.700\nAddressing is really the goal is what\nunicast does, which is to make sure that\n\n316\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.162\ndata is able to be sent from\nthe source to the destination.\n\n317\n00:17:41.162 --> 00:17:44.375\nAddressing goal.\n\n318\n00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:56.120\nData from Source to Destination.\n\n319\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.610\nThat is the whole goal in any\naddressing type that we have out there.\n\n320\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.140\nYou and I though are really\nlimited to the realm of TCP/IP\n\n321\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.190\nbecause that's the networking model that\nwe've all fallen under at this point.\n\n322\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.300\nBut before we can even get to TC/IP that\n\n323\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.880\nmeans that there are possibilities of\nother address types that are out there.\n\n324\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.880\nSo the earliest form of this is\nwhat is known as a MAC Address,\n\n325\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.590\nMAC Address stands for\nMedia Access Control.\n\n326\n00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.340\nMedia Access Control addresses\nare assigned to hardware.\n\n327\n00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.090\nSo when you plug your computer in,\nthe card or\n\n328\n00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:42.800\nthe chip that is on your computer\nallows you to transmit or\n\n329\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.510\nreceive data on your network is\nassigned what we call a MAC address ID.\n\n330\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.300\nA MAC address.\n\n331\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:56.210\nNow, the other terminology that you'll\nalso hear is what is called BIA as well.\n\n332\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.090\nIt stands for burned in address.\n\n333\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.030\nThe reason why they call it burned in\naddress is because this is a sign that\n\n334\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.090\nthe factory, and that's the key.\n\n335\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.770\n&gt;&gt; This never was my favorite acronym for\nthis particular term, Ron.\n\n336\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.380\n&gt;&gt; No, why?\n\n337\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.430\n&gt;&gt; It's a little bit misleading, I feel.\n\n338\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.570\nWhat do you think?\n\n339\n00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Why would it be misleading?\n\n340\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.060\n&gt;&gt; Why, me like if I brand you or\nsomething, it's burned in.\n\n341\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n342\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.510\n&gt;&gt; I guess you could change it if you\ndecided to get another brand on top of it,\n\n343\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.150\nbut it seems pretty permanent whereas\nas a MAC address, for the most part,\n\n344\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.270\nis pretty permanent but it can be changed.\n\n345\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, it can be masked,, so\nyes, you can kind of mask it.\n\n346\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.580\nBut for you to actually change\nthe firmware on that device and\n\n347\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.880\nremove the MAC address it really is kind,\nvery accomplishable\n\n348\n00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.190\nonly by using a big gigantic soldering\niron [LAUGH] a lot of times.\n\n349\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.250\nBut no, yes,\nyou can mask the address here.\n\n350\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.357\nBut burned in addresses,\nit is just a nomenclature that,\n\n351\n00:19:48.357 --> 00:19:51.064\nthat- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right, because even in virtualization\n\n352\n00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:54.500\nthere's nothing to burn it into-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n353\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.260\nthen if you actually live in\nthe realm of Microsoft LAN,\n\n354\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.170\nthey call it the-\n&gt;&gt; Physical address.\n\n355\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Physical address, and that's because it\nis stamped on right there at whatever the-\n\n356\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.200\n&gt;&gt; Device.\n\n357\n00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Device is going to be.\n\n358\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.080\n&gt;&gt; Visible, yeah.\n\n359\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.950\n&gt;&gt; Now, this address, the reason we're\nactually spending a little bit of\n\n360\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.889\ntime on this,\nis that it's a 48 bit address.\n\n361\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.310\nNow, that doesn't make\nsense to most of us.\n\n362\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.650\nAnd the reason why it doesn't make\nsense to most of us is because\n\n363\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.370\nit's a huge pool of numbers.\n\n364\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.840\nAnd the reason behind that is because\nthey want to make sure that there is no\n\n365\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.930\ntwo NICs ever produced.\n\n366\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.900\nFrom the beginning time\nthat they ever made a NIC,\n\n367\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.145\nto the end of time that they make NICs\nthat that number will ever be done again.\n\n368\n00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:44.696\nSo if were to take this let's say\nlet's use the trusty old Windows\n\n369\n00:20:44.696 --> 00:20:46.693\ncalculator here, if I can.\n\n370\n00:20:46.693 --> 00:20:49.590\nWhy am I actually not getting\nthe trusty old Window calculator.\n\n371\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.790\nThere we go.\n\n372\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.670\nSo what is 48 bit mean.\n\n373\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.154\nIt means 2 to the 48th power, no wait,\n\n374\n00:20:57.154 --> 00:21:03.330\nthat is too square,\nI should have done the other one.\n\n375\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.150\nWhere is the other one here?\n\n376\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.520\nDoes it not do the powers thing here?\n\n377\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.340\n&gt;&gt; I do not know where you are going with\nthis Ronny, but I have a feeling as far as\n\n378\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.731\nuniqueness and availability-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n379\n00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:15.650\nTwo to the 48th power.\n\n380\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.960\nBut I used the wrong calculator,\nis what happened.\n\n381\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.870\nThat is that many different numbers\nthat you'll have to go through\n\n382\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.051\nbefore you'll actually\nhave to issue a one again.\n\n383\n00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:24.741\n&gt;&gt; A duplicate?\n\n384\n00:21:24.741 --> 00:21:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, before you issue a duplicate.\n\n385\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.380\n&gt;&gt; I know there are instances where\nthere were errors and there have been.\n\n386\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's called [INAUDIBLE].\n\n387\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.950\nThat does end up happening some times, but\nthe reason why it happens is that some\n\n388\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.140\nmachine ended up getting stamped wrong,\nand it does happen.\n\n389\n00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.310\nBut usually they catch them\nbefore they leave factory-\n\n390\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.400\n&gt;&gt; Quality assurance, yeah.\n\n391\n00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.360\n&gt;&gt; Not always, but they do.\n\n392\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.180\nSo in this set of numbers that you see,\n\n393\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.460\nright after this third\nset here is billions.\n\n394\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.400\nSo there's four billion.\n\n395\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.760\nThat would be 70 billion, 400 billion,\nand then you get to trillion.\n\n396\n00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.602\nAnd then you get to 281\ntrillion possible combinations.\n\n397\n00:21:57.602 --> 00:21:59.011\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot, yeah.\n\n398\n00:21:59.011 --> 00:22:03.220\n&gt;&gt; So that address should\nnever be duplicated at all.\n\n399\n00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.540\nNow the reason why that's important is\nbecause this large pool of numbers them,\n\n400\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.830\nas much as it can be on every\nsingle device on this planet.\n\n401\n00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.000\nIs that it is one pool of numbers,\nand that means that in theory,\n\n402\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.310\nif they were all on one big network,\none gigantic network,\n\n403\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.980\nall over the planet they\nwould be able to communicate.\n\n404\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.320\nNow Cherokee, as far as you and\n\n405\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.065\nI know, on the Internet,\nis it one big network, on the Internet?\n\n406\n00:22:30.065 --> 00:22:31.087\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's what?\n\n407\n00:22:31.087 --> 00:22:31.860\n&gt;&gt; No, all just separate.\n\n408\n00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.360\n&gt;&gt; Millions.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n409\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's millions of networks.\n\n410\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:44.000\nSo with this particular address,\nand there's trillions of devices,\n\n411\n00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.880\ntrillions of devices which I can't type,\nthink they're on the same network.\n\n412\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.470\nThe problem is, in reality, they are not\non the same network all around the world.\n\n413\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.180\nSo if there's multiple networks then,\n\n414\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.810\nthe other issue that we have with\nMac addresses is they don't know\n\n415\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.540\nhow to communicate with somebody\non a different network.\n\n416\n00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n417\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in this sense with\n\n418\n00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:17.680\nthe MAC address cannot communicate with\n\n419\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.190\nsomeone on a different network.\n\n420\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.670\nSo that is where the problem lies.\n\n421\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.120\nWith understanding this,\nwith that pool of addresses that we have.\n\n422\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.970\nAnd even though in theory, if we were\nto put them all on the same network,\n\n423\n00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.010\nthey could communicate, they can't.\n\n424\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.650\nBecause that's not how the Internet\ndeveloped, as one big, gigantic network.\n\n425\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.800\n&gt;&gt; And it shouldn't just be\na completely arbitrary number,\n\n426\n00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.510\nthere is a little bit of logic that\ngoes into that, right, Ronnie?\n\n427\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.480\n&gt;&gt; There really is.\n\n428\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.612\nSo one of the things that happened right\nat the beginning is when we start talking\n\n429\n00:23:49.612 --> 00:23:51.597\nabout the design of the address here.\n\n430\n00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.456\nIs that it's separated\ninto two component parts.\n\n431\n00:23:59.456 --> 00:24:03.513\nAll right, so the first part,\nor the first.\n\n432\n00:24:03.513 --> 00:24:08.579\n&gt;&gt; Half?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, 24 bits, okay, is actually\n\n433\n00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:13.506\ncalled the OUI, OUI, which stands for\n\n434\n00:24:13.506 --> 00:24:18.595\nOrganizationally Unique Identifier.\n\n435\n00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.220\nWhich I can't spell, okay?\n\n436\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.138\nNow that\nOrganizationally Unique Identifier,\n\n437\n00:24:24.138 --> 00:24:27.865\nit's essentially a vendor number, that's\nwhat it comes down to, is a vendor number.\n\n438\n00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:31.746\nYou can go and search out on the internet\nusing your favorite browser, you know your\n\n439\n00:24:31.746 --> 00:24:35.361\nsearch engine, and go hey, what does\nthe first 24 bits of the MAC address?\n\n440\n00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:39.183\n&gt;&gt; Right, whatever device you're\nworking with, do a Google search and\n\n441\n00:24:39.183 --> 00:24:42.828\nyou'll see if it's Microsoft,\nCisco, whatever Mac products.\n\n442\n00:24:42.828 --> 00:24:44.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it will actually show that.\n\n443\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.450\nNow, even though it's actually done\nin binary because of the bits,\n\n444\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.110\nit's normally reported\nin hexadecimal as well.\n\n445\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.580\nSo that's the first 24 bits.\n\n446\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.490\nWell what about the actual\nsecond 24 bits then, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.284\nWell that is more than likely\nthe same as a serial number, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:00.284 --> 00:25:03.730\nSo it is just a unique identifier itself.\n\n449\n00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.583\nSo this is just a unique identifier.\n\n450\n00:25:09.455 --> 00:25:11.116\nSo you can call it a serial number.\n\n451\n00:25:14.624 --> 00:25:16.610\nIdentifier, okay.\n\n452\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.190\nNow when we start taking a look\nat something like this, right?\n\n453\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.461\nThe very fact that we have this\ncombination here says that any one company\n\n454\n00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:25.499\nthen, so like for example Intel.\n\n455\n00:25:25.499 --> 00:25:27.425\nIf they wanted to produce Nix,\n\n456\n00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:32.537\nwell they would put the first 24 bit sets\nidentifying them as the manufacturer,\n\n457\n00:25:32.537 --> 00:25:36.450\nand then they would stamp\ntheir own unique ID on that.\n\n458\n00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.725\nSame thing with Cisco, as they\nproduce their own Nix which they do,\n\n459\n00:25:39.725 --> 00:25:42.490\nthey do the same thing, and\nthat makes them all unique.\n\n460\n00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.526\nNow that doesn't mean that they aren't\non the same network In theory, right?\n\n461\n00:25:46.526 --> 00:25:50.612\nAnd logical, if we were to do this and\nput them all on the same network,\n\n462\n00:25:50.612 --> 00:25:53.123\nthey should still be able to communicate.\n\n463\n00:25:53.123 --> 00:25:56.560\nBut they can't communicate across\nwhat we call our network boundaries.\n\n464\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.800\nAnd the reason why this is important\nis because it means that if we want to\n\n465\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.215\ncommunicate across networks, we need to\nunderstand what the network boundary is.\n\n466\n00:26:06.215 --> 00:26:10.582\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie I know I just kind of jumped\nin mid-stream here during your show, but\n\n467\n00:26:10.582 --> 00:26:13.726\nI saw you talking and\ngoing over some previous episodes.\n\n468\n00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:16.008\nI saw your really cool\ndiagrams of the OSI model,\n\n469\n00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:18.692\nlooked like you guys were\ntalking about encapsulation.\n\n470\n00:26:18.692 --> 00:26:23.210\nSo I'm assuming that you already\nknow about the different OSI layers.\n\n471\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.474\nSo when in terms of OSI here at the MAC\naddress, what are we looking at?\n\n472\n00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:29.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once you start taking\na look at the OSI model, right?\n\n473\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:36.214\nSo that's where this works on Layer 2,\nokay, of the OSI model.\n\n474\n00:26:39.474 --> 00:26:44.560\nAnd it also works on the Network Layer,\nOr the Network Access.\n\n475\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:50.328\nWorks on the, Network Access Layer\n\n476\n00:26:50.328 --> 00:26:54.560\nof the TCP/IP model as well, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.350\nSo both of those will actually\nhelp us out here when we start\n\n478\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.650\nthinking about this, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.492\nSo this is, for us here, right?\n\n480\n00:27:01.492 --> 00:27:05.430\nIt is the beginning of understanding\nthe purpose of the address.\n\n481\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:11.510\nWhen we dive into now trying to say, well,\nhow do we cross those network boundaries?\n\n482\n00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:16.251\nIt means that we have to have a mechanism\nor an identifier that allows us to be\n\n483\n00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:20.768\nable to distinguish those networks,\nand then be able to get that data,\n\n484\n00:27:20.768 --> 00:27:24.716\nnot only in that one big network,\nbut now to another network.\n\n485\n00:27:24.716 --> 00:27:31.017\nAnd that is where we begin with,\nof course then, IP addresses, okay?\n\n486\n00:27:31.017 --> 00:27:37.082\nAnd this is actually gonna\nbe our Layer 3 address,\n\n487\n00:27:37.082 --> 00:27:42.852\nokay, or\nthe Internet Layer of the OSI model.\n\n488\n00:27:42.852 --> 00:27:44.276\nIt's not OSI, TCP/IP.\n\n489\n00:27:44.276 --> 00:27:44.829\n&gt;&gt; TCP/IP.\n\n490\n00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna get all that confused.\n\n491\n00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.960\nOkay, so those are the addresses that\nwe are going to really focus in on so\n\n492\n00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.500\nthat we have a good understanding of\nhow this ends up happening, okay?\n\n493\n00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.113\nSo we started off by just talking about\nthe different address types here.\n\n494\n00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:03.307\nAnd we then tried to show you that\naddressing can be done at any layer that\n\n495\n00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:03.849\nwe want to.\n\n496\n00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:06.369\nBut limitations of just\nusing the MAC address,\n\n497\n00:28:06.369 --> 00:28:10.346\nis because they really aren't designed\nto go across network boundaries.\n\n498\n00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:13.901\nAnd now it means we are ready to\nstart diving into the idea here\n\n499\n00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.038\nof IP version for addresses and\nunderstanding them,\n\n500\n00:28:17.038 --> 00:28:19.912\nand then showing you where\nto apply them as well.\n\n501\n00:28:19.912 --> 00:28:20.978\nBut Cherokee,\nI think I've run out of time.\n\n502\n00:28:20.978 --> 00:28:24.140\n&gt;&gt; I know it, we're looking at\nthe clock here and I know you\n\n503\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.100\nhave a lot of great information that you\nwanna share looking at IP addresses.\n\n504\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.614\nSo I think we should table\nthat until the next episode.\n\n505\n00:28:29.614 --> 00:28:31.570\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for your time.\n\n506\n00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.941\nThank you for your time, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n507\n00:28:33.941 --> 00:28:35.380\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n508\n00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.209\n&gt;&gt;

I'm doing fine, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.640\nThank you for having me on the show,\n\n14\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.230\nas we continue our journey in\nunderstanding a little bit more about of\n\n15\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.115\ncourse networking here, and\nthe logical side of networking.\n\n16\n00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:47.430\nWe've taken a look at cables just briefly.\n\n17\n00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.640\nWe've talked about some of the devices,\nbut now we're kinda\n\n18\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.510\ngetting into the heart of things\nthat you're gonna have to just know.\n\n19\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110\nSo what we're getting in to of course,\nis the stuff\n\n20\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.114\nthat you just have to know second hand\nas you get ready for this season exam.\n\n21\n00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:07.010\nNone of what we're going over should throw\nyou if you're preparing for the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.250\nSo if you're already not confident with\nthat, make sure you review this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880\nMake sure you take some time and\nunderstand the concepts that we're about\n\n24\n00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.670\nto talk about,\nas we continue to move forward.\n\n25\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.278\nCuz we're gonna go over some basics,\nand then we're gonna get into\n\n26\n00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:23.178\nsome stuff that's a little bit more\ndifficult as we move through the show.\n\n27\n00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:26.241\nBut at least at this point, we're just\ntalking about the rock solid basics here.\n\n28\n00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:26.981\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n29\n00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:32.121\nthose rock solid basics are gonna stay\nwith you for hopefully your entire career.\n\n30\n00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I mean,\n\n31\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.610\neven in shows I was working on the other\nday, a pretty high level series.\n\n32\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.090\nThat is assumptive knowledge,\n\n33\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.200\nand you should already be able\nto have that information.\n\n34\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.240\nSo if you don't get it now, then take\nthe time to make sure you wrap your brain\n\n35\n00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.900\naround it, and really go back and\nwatch Ronnie 5,000 times.\n\n36\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.320\n&gt;&gt; Well let's not do that,\n\n38\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.420\nbecause that's probably straining\nyour eyeballs a bit more if you start\n\n39\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.350\ndoing that, but let's do talk about\nthis topic here on IP addresses.\n\n40\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.490\nSo in our previous episode,\nwe ended up talking a little bit of time,\n\n41\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.730\ntaking a little bit of time talking\nabout the idea of the Mac address, and\n\n42\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.390\nunderstanding the purpose of addressing.\n\n43\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.970\nIs really direct communication.\n\n44\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.320\nSo whether we're talking about unicast,\nmulticast,\n\n45\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.640\nbroadcast, it all works based\noff of addressing at some point.\n\n46\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.270\nThen we showed you the initial addressing\nthat we have used of course, which is\n\n47\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.370\nthe MAC address, and is an integral\npart of how we do networking today.\n\n48\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.900\nBut at the same time,\n\n49\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.490\nwe also showed you the limitations of\nusing a MAC address just for transmission.\n\n50\n00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.080\nThe very fact is, as long as all\nthe devices on the same network,\n\n51\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.420\nMac addresses works perfectly fine.\n\n52\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.310\nBut once we start to\nhave to communicate and\n\n53\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.270\nto connect two devices that\nare across networks though.\n\n54\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.960\nWe can't use Mac any more.\n\n55\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.810\nBecause they assume that\neverybody's on one big network and\n\n56\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.390\neven on the Internet, there's\nactually multiple networks out there\n\n57\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.070\nin which the Mac addresses cannot\ncommunicate across that boundary.\n\n58\n00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.770\nSo that's what we have to understand\nas we continue to see and\n\n59\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.760\nmove the way that we want to.\n\n60\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.010\nSo we're picking up at this point, where\nwe've moved on from the MAC addresses and\n\n61\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.630\nwe're now starting to talk about\nthe IP addressing as well.\n\n62\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.090\nLet's take a look at the notes\nthat I've been making here.\n\n63\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.195\nAnd I've just kinda cleared off\nthe screen to start a little bit again.\n\n64\n00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:20.565\nSo remember that this actually\noccurs at layer three of the OSI.\n\n65\n00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:23.951\nAnd then also at the Internet.\n\n66\n00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:33.165\nLayer of the TCP/IP model as well.\n\n67\n00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:36.550\nSo make sure you actually match both\nof those up as you get ready for\n\n68\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.250\nthe exam as well.\n\n69\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.250\nNow, on the addressing itself when\nwe actually take the look at.\n\n70\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.812\nMost of the time,\nwhen we start talking about IP address,\n\n71\n00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:52.962\nthe reality of an IP address is that it's\nwhat we would call a 32-bit binary number.\n\n72\n00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:58.640\nLet's call it a binary identifier,\nnumber's actually easier.\n\n73\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.690\nNumber or identifier.\n\n74\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.720\nAnd that is actually,\n\n75\n00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.640\nbecause it does identify that\nmachine on that network for us.\n\n76\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.000\nSo, when we actually\nunderstand the idea of binary,\n\n77\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.220\nit's actually a string of 32 one's and\nzero's.\n\n78\n00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.350\nThat's what it comes down to.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty straight forward.\n\n79\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Seems to be straight forward, but\n\n80\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.450\nthe great thing is since you and\nI didn't probably grow up knowing binary,\n\n81\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.670\nlearning binary or\nunderstanding it too much.\n\n82\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.480\nIt normally is reported though in what\nwe call, well, Dotted Decimal Notation.\n\n83\n00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:34.770\nAnd decimal system though,\nis something that we did learn.\n\n84\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.180\nSo Dotted Decimal Notation.\n\n85\n00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:46.338\nSo for example here,\n192.168.10.100 is actually an example.\n\n86\n00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:49.160\nSo that translates into 32 ones and\n\n87\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.110\nzeroes at some point is what\nit ends up translating into.\n\n88\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.730\nNow, notice the dots in the middle\nhere as you start to see in between.\n\n89\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.530\nAnd that's because trying to\ntranslate this number in reality and\n\n90\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.250\nwhat it comes out to be,\nit's a horrendously long number.\n\n91\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.400\nAnd it doesn't match up exactly\nlike the numbers that we have here.\n\n92\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.073\nSo they separate it out into\nsmaller sections to make it easier.\n\n93\n00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:15.248\n&gt;&gt; Good, more manageable sections here.\n\n94\n00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.008\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n95\n00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:20.260\nthey actually separate\nit out into 4 octets.\n\n96\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.773\nAnd that is four sets\nof eight binary bits.\n\n97\n00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:32.021\nSo each one of those in\nbetween the actual dot set.\n\n98\n00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:36.099\nIs essentially a representation of\n8 bits of binary as what we have.\n\n99\n00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.734\nAnd that makes it easier,\nbecause the highest number that\n\n100\n00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:45.471\nwe can get in one of those 8\nbits section is gonna be 255.\n\n101\n00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:47.324\nSo that's the highest\nnumber that we can get.\n\n102\n00:05:47.324 --> 00:05:50.909\nSo you should never see in\nterms of an IP address,\n\n103\n00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.729\nwhen there's a number larger\nthan 255 in that set of numbers.\n\n104\n00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.229\nNow, if you're like me and you watch some\nTV shows, when they start doing this kind\n\n105\n00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.366\nof cyber tracking thing, this is where\nTV shows just kinda go off and board.\n\n106\n00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:05.030\n&gt;&gt; Gets silly?\n\n107\n00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n108\n00:06:05.918 --> 00:06:10.074\nthen you start seeing them like 523.924.\n\n109\n00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:12.940\nAnd you start going, man,\nthat's kind of the weirdest addressing.\n\n110\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.890\nBut more than likely, it's because\nthey really can't use real numbers\n\n111\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.180\nthat might affect somebody's network,\nis what it turns out to be.\n\n112\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.140\nSo just realize that you will\nhave something like that.\n\n113\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.760\nSo this is normally the way that you and\nI encounter that.\n\n114\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.550\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here,\n\n115\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.250\nwhen we start seeing\nthe idea of addressing.\n\n116\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.580\nSo every machine that's connected\nto a network of course,\n\n117\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.660\nthen will have an IP\naddress connected to it.\n\n118\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.500\nSo for example,\nmy machine right here has an IP address.\n\n119\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.170\nIf I want to show you that,\nI can do it in a couple of different ways.\n\n120\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.674\nI'm just gonna just come down here to\nthe Cortana search bar on my Windows 10\n\n121\n00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:50.604\nmachine, and type in cmd for\nthe command prompt.\n\n122\n00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:58.120\nAnd on this command prompt, I'm just gonna\ndo an ipconfig to bring out that command.\n\n123\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.370\nAnd you'll see right away, it actually\nshows me well, this number right here.\n\n124\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.390\nAnd that is my IP version 4 address.\n\n125\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.660\nEvery machine will have one,\nwhether you're on Windows or\n\n126\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.990\nwhether you're on a MacBook or\nMac, whatever you want to call it.\n\n127\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.410\nWhether you're on a Linux machine,\nyou'll actually have an IP address\n\n128\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.830\nthat you'll be able to\nactually have on your machine.\n\n129\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.182\nNow, each one of these addresses\nif you're in the same network,\n\n130\n00:07:26.182 --> 00:07:31.566\nyou actually see that some of these bits\nyou'll share will be in common with other\n\n131\n00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:37.050\npeople on their machines, and some of them\nwill not be in common with that as well.\n\n132\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.429\nNow Cherokee and\nI are actually on a different network.\n\n133\n00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:42.409\nI'm actually on a 172.16 network.\n\n134\n00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:45.072\nAnd Cherokee, if you'll do the IP\nconfig for me on your machine?\n\n135\n00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:46.128\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n136\n00:07:46.128 --> 00:07:48.810\n&gt;&gt; We'll kind of make a comparison here.\n\n137\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.127\nAnd we'll see that the bits don't even\nmatch, cuz I think she is on the ten dot\n\n138\n00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:56.202\nsomething network, if I remember right.\n&gt;&gt; 192.968.22.1 Weird,\n\n139\n00:07:56.202 --> 00:08:00.266\nI wonder where you're getting that\nparticular network from cuz that's not\n\n140\n00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:02.245\nactually anywhere in our building.\n\n141\n00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.452\nMaybe unless you're,\nno you are using wireless so\n\n142\n00:08:04.452 --> 00:08:06.876\nyou could actually be on some\nbodies wireless network.\n\n143\n00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:11.170\nThat's about perfectly fine, so\nshe's on a 192168, what dot 1?\n\n144\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.244\n&gt;&gt; Dot, 168.222.1\n\n145\n00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:14.916\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so,\n\n146\n00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.355\nwow that's a pretty neat number.\n\n147\n00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:20.447\nSo you actually see that when those\naddresses don't even match then that's\n\n148\n00:08:20.447 --> 00:08:22.632\nactually an indication\nthat they're on different-\n\n149\n00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:23.619\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking at my VMware machine\n\n150\n00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:24.153\nthere, Ronnie.\n\n151\n00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:25.552\nSorry, I've got a couple machines running.\n\n152\n00:08:25.552 --> 00:08:26.889\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no, that makes more sense now.\n\n153\n00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:27.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's my bridged adapter.\n\n154\n00:08:27.928 --> 00:08:28.849\n&gt;&gt; That you're actually\n\n155\n00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:29.820\non the VMware machine.\n\n156\n00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.245\nYeah, so you'll actually end\nup seeing something like that.\n\n157\n00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:35.967\nSo every machine on the same node,\nsome these bits will actually be the same,\n\n158\n00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:37.067\nsome of them will not.\n\n159\n00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:41.345\nThe separation with the dots here are\nactually just to help you and I be able\n\n160\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:46.106\nto manage these IP addresses, instead\nof actually looking at a 32-bit address\n\n161\n00:08:46.106 --> 00:08:50.931\nstring, is what it actually does for us.\n&gt;&gt; You're right, my real Ethernet\n\n162\n00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:55.849\nadapter is gonna be in the ten-dot range.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so cool, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:55.849 --> 00:09:00.531\nNow the great thing about this address,\nokay, so even though it's just\n\n164\n00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:05.541\na single 32-bit number it's actually\ndivided into two portions, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:09.846\nSo that 32 bit number represents\ntwo portions of the address.\n\n166\n00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:14.862\nAnd those two portions,\nusually this one is called the network ID,\n\n167\n00:09:14.862 --> 00:09:19.097\nokay, and that is the grouping,\nthe logical grouping.\n\n168\n00:09:23.782 --> 00:09:26.243\nOkay, that we are a part of.\n\n169\n00:09:26.243 --> 00:09:30.180\nAnd then the other portion is\nalso known as the HostID or\n\n170\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.271\nnode ID sometimes you'll hear it saying.\n\n171\n00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:39.766\nAnd this is the unique\nidentifier within that group.\n\n172\n00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:44.417\nOkay, so those are the actually two\nportions of that 32 bit address.\n\n173\n00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.658\nSo what does that mean?\n\n174\n00:09:45.658 --> 00:09:49.139\nThat means of those 32 bits, okay.\n\n175\n00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:54.010\nSome of those, let's say the first\n24 bits, just as an example,\n\n176\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.469\nare the network ID.\n\n177\n00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:57.383\nWell that means the rest of the bits.\n\n178\n00:09:57.383 --> 00:10:01.692\nSo you take 32 and you subtract out\n24 that leaves you with 8 bits.\n\n179\n00:10:01.692 --> 00:10:04.467\nThat is gonna be your unique identifier.\n\n180\n00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:06.747\nSo if you change that number and\nyou go, hey,\n\n181\n00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:08.850\nwhat about if I chose the first 16 bits?\n\n182\n00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.861\nWell, that means the last 16\nbits is your unique identifier.\n\n183\n00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:16.772\nAs long as you don't go over\nthose 32 bits, you are fine.\n\n184\n00:10:16.772 --> 00:10:21.333\nokay, that's kind of a key for us too.\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I do see an example here in\n\n185\n00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:24.785\nyour notes that I think is a perfect\nexample for explaining this.\n\n186\n00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:27.159\nI think it really resonates\nwith a lot of people.\n\n187\n00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:31.541\nAnd that would be the example of let's\nsay you and I lived on the same street,\n\n188\n00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:33.948\nlike Sesame Street, right.\n&gt;&gt; Sesame Street, okay.\n\n189\n00:10:33.948 --> 00:10:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n190\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.561\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so here we go.\n\n191\n00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:41.269\nSo this does match up to\nan equivalency right here, right.\n\n192\n00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:47.013\nA what we call a street address,\nIf I can spell street, street address.\n\n193\n00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.544\nOkay, so\nCherokee has given us an example here,\n\n194\n00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:52.837\nthat what we can actually have right,\nand the street address.\n\n195\n00:10:52.837 --> 00:11:00.310\nIf we take a look at something like\nthis it might be 123 Sesame Street.\n\n196\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.864\nAll right, [LAUGH] okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:11:01.864 --> 00:11:03.406\n&gt;&gt; 123 Sesame Street.\n\n198\n00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:05.944\nWell remember that even though\nthat's what we call it,\n\n199\n00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:08.703\nright, it actually is divided\nup into two portions, okay.\n\n200\n00:11:08.703 --> 00:11:11.756\nSo the first portion of\nthis is gonna be the 123,\n\n201\n00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:13.608\nwhich is gonna be what?\n&gt;&gt; The house number.\n\n202\n00:11:13.608 --> 00:11:17.430\n&gt;&gt; The house number, And then the second\n\n203\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:25.606\none here is actually gonna be what\nthe street name, If I can spell Sesame.\n\n204\n00:11:27.555 --> 00:11:28.667\nAnd that's gonna be street name.\n\n205\n00:11:32.773 --> 00:11:35.952\nSo when we start to take\na look at something like this,\n\n206\n00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:39.213\nit is kinda the same analogy\nthat's used here, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:39.213 --> 00:11:43.917\nIn a network the network ID\nitself is like the street name,\n\n208\n00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:46.609\nwhich I can't remember, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:48.697\nThe street name here, Sesame Street.\n\n210\n00:11:48.697 --> 00:11:53.095\nAnd then on Sesame Street,\nthen there can be multiple houses.\n\n211\n00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:56.176\nSo if we have multiple houses\nit means that each house\n\n212\n00:11:56.176 --> 00:11:58.847\non that street needs to\nhave a unique number.\n\n213\n00:12:07.468 --> 00:12:09.487\n&gt;&gt; Yet that can be a little confusing for\n\n214\n00:12:09.487 --> 00:12:12.938\nthe mail carrier if there were\ntwo houses labeled as one, two,\n\n215\n00:12:12.938 --> 00:12:17.326\nthree Sesame Street, and then another one,\none, two, three Sesame Street.\n\n216\n00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:20.127\nAnd they have a letter and they're like,\nI don't know who to deliver\n\n217\n00:12:20.127 --> 00:12:22.777\nthis message to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would actually be 100%\n\n218\n00:12:22.777 --> 00:12:26.129\nconfusing for someone like that to try and\ndeliver that letter.\n\n219\n00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:30.886\nWell, now imagine same thing when we start\ntalking about delivery of packets within\n\n220\n00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:35.726\na network even though you might share that\nsame street or that same logical grouping.\n\n221\n00:12:35.726 --> 00:12:40.628\nTo be able to get the data as a unicast\nfrom it's source to the right destination,\n\n222\n00:12:40.628 --> 00:12:43.455\nit has to be able to know\nwhat network to get to.\n\n223\n00:12:43.455 --> 00:12:48.826\nAnd then exactly what particular device\nin that network to get to as well.\n\n224\n00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:53.373\nSo that is what we want to understand\nabout the way that this address actually\n\n225\n00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:58.077\nfunctions for us because it really does\nhelp us out here when we start to see it.\n\n226\n00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:02.874\nNow, the addressing\nitself is also limited,\n\n227\n00:13:02.874 --> 00:13:10.259\nbecause if we start taking a look at\nthat idea once again of the 32 bit.\n\n228\n00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:16.919\nI say 32 bit number, well,\nthat is actually a limitation by itself.\n\n229\n00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:22.224\nBut let me bring up the calculator\nlike I did in the last episode here.\n\n230\n00:13:22.224 --> 00:13:27.017\nAnd since I left it at scientific\nit should do this for me easily.\n\n231\n00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:31.897\nAnd that 32 bit means 2\nto the 32nd power and\n\n232\n00:13:31.897 --> 00:13:38.256\nthat's a little bit under 4.3 billion,\nokay, numbers.\n\n233\n00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:42.698\nNow if we compare that to when we did\nthis with the Mac address, right.\n\n234\n00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:45.859\nOkay, that's a much bigger\nnumber as you start to see that.\n\n235\n00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:50.130\nBut a little bit under 4.3\nbillion possible numbers here.\n\n236\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.186\n&gt;&gt; Seems like a large number Ronnie.\n\n237\n00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:54.424\n&gt;&gt; It does seem like a large number but\n\n238\n00:13:54.424 --> 00:13:58.050\nthe way that we divide it up\nto manage it actually reduces\n\n239\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.457\nthat number significantly as well.\n\n240\n00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:03.647\nSo you do have to pay,\ndid I put three L's, no, I didn't.\n\n241\n00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:06.491\nI was wondering why I put three\nL's in there for billion.\n\n242\n00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:12.232\nSo it was a little bit under 4.3 billion\npossible combinations of those numbers.\n\n243\n00:14:12.232 --> 00:14:15.277\nBut now when we start\ntalking about managing it and\n\n244\n00:14:15.277 --> 00:14:19.638\nwhat we have to do it reduces that\nparticular number quite a bit, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:23.271\nSo there are limitations here\nwhen we start to see it.\n\n246\n00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:25.170\nNow, you might want to\nknow why 4.3 billion.\n\n247\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.273\nWell, cuz that's the way that if\nyou take two to three second power.\n\n248\n00:14:28.273 --> 00:14:32.069\nThat's the number that they chose\nto go with as the maximum link, and\n\n249\n00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:33.516\nit made sense at the time.\n\n250\n00:14:33.516 --> 00:14:37.233\nAnd if you think at the time when\nit really started to come out,\n\n251\n00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:40.166\nthey probably thought\nabout the idea of nobody,\n\n252\n00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:44.117\nnot every single person on the planet\nis gonna need an IP address.\n\n253\n00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:48.489\nAnd the population was probably right\nabout 4 billion people at that point.\n\n254\n00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:51.972\nSo it did make sense,\nthat if they were say, look,\n\n255\n00:14:51.972 --> 00:14:56.433\nlet's assign an IP address to\nevery person on the planet, okay.\n\n256\n00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.841\nAnd you assign an IP address\nto every person on the planet.\n\n257\n00:14:58.841 --> 00:15:01.494\nWell then there's not really a need for\nwhat?\n\n258\n00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:04.756\nFor any more IP addresses\nout there at that point.\n\n259\n00:15:04.756 --> 00:15:07.469\nSo they didn't really kind\nof think beyond that, so-\n\n260\n00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:10.317\n&gt;&gt; Right, that we would need IP addresses\n\n261\n00:15:10.317 --> 00:15:15.409\nfor, light bulbs and watches, and\nsneakers, and dogs, or whatever\n\n262\n00:15:15.409 --> 00:15:18.437\nwe want to put IP addresses on today.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n263\n00:15:18.437 --> 00:15:21.629\nlet's think about just right here\nin this room, Cherokee, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.832\nSo one IP address,\n\n265\n00:15:22.832 --> 00:15:27.206\nwell, today is almost an impossibility\nto only have one IP address.\n\n266\n00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:30.431\nCherokee, you have your phone.\n&gt;&gt; Not in the room technically but\n\n267\n00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:33.300\nit's right outside the door.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right outside the door but you\n\n268\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.448\nalso have that smart watch there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n269\n00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:36.564\n&gt;&gt; Smart watch, you have your laptop,\n\n270\n00:15:36.564 --> 00:15:37.932\nyou have a virtual machine running there,\nso\n\n271\n00:15:37.932 --> 00:15:39.220\nif you were to use- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n272\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.598\nI got two virtual machines running, so\nI'm just queuing through my IP addresses.\n\n273\n00:15:43.598 --> 00:15:44.439\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n274\n00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:47.921\nif we were to actually use the IP\naddresses that we originally begin with,\n\n275\n00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:51.865\nbut you yourself actually already have\ntaken up two or three people's addresses.\n\n276\n00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:52.408\n&gt;&gt; Big offender over here.\n\n277\n00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:53.092\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n278\n00:15:53.092 --> 00:15:57.736\nthey plan that because look not everybody\non the planet is gonna need it.\n\n279\n00:15:57.736 --> 00:16:01.014\nSo we assign this pool of numbers.\n\n280\n00:16:01.014 --> 00:16:03.160\nWe're never gonna really run out.\n\n281\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.840\nThat's exactly what started to happen as\nit started to run out very quickly and\n\n282\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.875\nthe reason it did is a couple of things.\n\n283\n00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:09.420\nOkay?\n\n284\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.342\nOne is because of that management here.\n\n285\n00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:12.003\nOkay?\n\n286\n00:16:12.003 --> 00:16:14.361\nThat with the 4.3 billion addresses and\n\n287\n00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:18.554\nthey thought that they would manage\nthis smartly, they were looking out for\n\n288\n00:16:18.554 --> 00:16:22.969\nthe idea of commerce here, so management\nis actually what started to limit it.\n\n289\n00:16:22.969 --> 00:16:23.694\nOkay?\n\n290\n00:16:23.694 --> 00:16:24.968\nSo what do we mean by this?\n\n291\n00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:29.095\nWell, they actually started to\nmanage this using what they\n\n292\n00:16:29.095 --> 00:16:31.258\ncalled Classful Addressing.\n\n293\n00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:32.130\nOkay?\n\n294\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.910\nNow when we start taking a look at\nthis idea of Classful Addressing and\n\n295\n00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.104\nwhat it does, right?\n\n296\n00:16:37.104 --> 00:16:40.950\nIs that it actually created three\ndifferent classes of addresses.\n\n297\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:48.560\nThere's actually a Class A,\nthere's Class B,\n\n298\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.270\nthere's Class C and\nI should say five classes altogether.\n\n299\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.160\nBut we'll talk about these last\ntwo that's something special.\n\n300\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.400\nBut let's do it for\nthe sake of completeness here.\n\n301\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.860\nAnd there's also Class E\naddresses as well.\n\n302\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.880\nSo the way that they began to\ndo this is that they said, look,\n\n303\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:14.710\nin Class A addresses, what we're gonna\ndo is we are going to say from 1 network\n\n304\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:20.780\nall the way through 127,\nentire network here.\n\n305\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:22.930\nOkay?\n\n306\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.900\nThat's gonna be a Class A address\nin terms of its network range.\n\n307\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.520\nThen they started off with\nClass B as being 128 and\n\n308\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.910\nI should change that to a 1\n[INAUDIBLE] individual nodes here.\n\n309\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.150\nWe can't do a 0 a lot of times.\n\n310\n00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.226\nNot always but 3191\n\n311\n00:17:45.505 --> 00:17:53.763\nThen Class C here begins at 192 or 223.\n\n312\n00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.978\nAnd then Class D here, this is where\nit gets a little bit stranger.\n\n313\n00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:06.156\n224 through\n\n314\n00:18:06.156 --> 00:18:11.859\n239.\n&gt;&gt; And while Ronnie's typing,\n\n315\n00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:16.571\nyou can just notice that that first\noctet that he had introduced you to, so\n\n316\n00:18:16.571 --> 00:18:21.511\nthat first segment of those eight bits\nthere is really an easy way to determine\n\n317\n00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:27.150\nwhat class that IP address falls into when\nyou're talking about classful addressing.\n\n318\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.000\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n319\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.050\nwhen you start to break this down and\nyou start to take a look, okay?\n\n320\n00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.650\nIt really doesn't if you're not\nfamiliar with networking, right?\n\n321\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.879\nYou don't know why these classes\nare the way that they are.\n\n322\n00:18:37.879 --> 00:18:38.443\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n323\n00:18:38.443 --> 00:18:39.012\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n324\n00:18:39.012 --> 00:18:42.210\nSo it's really the first three\nclasses that we have to worry about.\n\n325\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.095\nClass D and E here were actually for\nsomething special.\n\n326\n00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:45.900\nOkay?\n\n327\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.020\nSo D is for what we call multicast\nstress which we did talk about already.\n\n328\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.810\nAnd E is for something that's experimental\nwhich we're never gonna get to\n\n329\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.300\nat this point in the way that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n330\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.990\nCuz we're actually starting to introduce,\nwell, I say introduce,\n\n331\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.860\nwe're starting to really move forward in\nthe realm of what we call IP version 6,\n\n332\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.700\nwhich we'll do in another episode.\n\n333\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.620\nBut here the way that this ends up working\nis that they started to actually have what\n\n334\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.760\nthey called a default subnet mask.\n\n335\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.190\nSo let me see if I can do this.\n\n336\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.059\nSo here's classes.\n\n337\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.760\nAnd then we'll call this\none Default Subnet Mask.\n\n338\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.090\nSo in a Class A, like what Cherokee\nwas saying, is that they said,\n\n339\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.840\nwe need a way to identify how we\nwant these networks to break up.\n\n340\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.250\nAnd so what they decided in the 32-bit\naddressing in the dotted decimal notation,\n\n341\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.970\nthey said the first 8-bits\nwill identify the network.\n\n342\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.958\nAnd they did the same thing here as well.\n\n343\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.245\nAnd they said the first 16 bits\nwill help identify that and\n\n344\n00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:58.320\nthen with Class C the first 24 bits.\n\n345\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.730\nSo if you were assigned a Class A address,\nthen you knew your network\n\n346\n00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:07.080\nnumber was gonna be 1 all\nthe way through 126 technically.\n\n347\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.730\nNow you might say, why didn't you say 127?\n\n348\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.870\nCuz that's a special range of addresses\nwhich helps to deplete the entire address\n\n349\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.730\npool that we have as well, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.890\nSo you'll see that that going up, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.433\nNow what did this actually end up\nmeaning in terms of the number of nodes?\n\n352\n00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:26.481\nNumber of hosts, I should say, per node.\n\n353\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.549\nSo in a Class A address,\nthat meant that a single network\n\n354\n00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:42.930\ncould have 16,770,214 possibilities.\n&gt;&gt; Now this kind of directly\n\n355\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.260\nties into what you were explaining\npreviously about that house address and\n\n356\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.820\nthe street address, right?\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n357\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.440\nYup.\n\n358\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.400\nSo this is where you actually see\nthe way that they do this, and\n\n359\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.180\nwe'll explain this a little bit later on\nwhen we start talking about what a subnet\n\n360\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.890\nmask is, but at this point,\nidentifiying the classes is the key.\n\n361\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.840\nThey're just telling us that\nthe first 8 bits of this address\n\n362\n00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.310\nof that 32 bit address is the network ID,\nin other words, the street.\n\n363\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.210\nAnd then the last 24 is your house\nnumber is what they're telling you.\n\n364\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.670\nSo at that point, that meant on a single\nstreet then, in theory, I could have\n\n365\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.115\n16,777,213 neighbors if I was one of them.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of neighbors.\n\n366\n00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:22.545\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of neighbors, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:22.545 --> 00:21:24.600\nSo that's what you have.\n\n368\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.907\nSo on this window,\n\n369\n00:21:25.907 --> 00:21:32.060\nthe number of networks that you'd have\nhere is like 126 networks on a Class A.\n\n370\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.580\nSo now you can imagine that when they\nfirst put this out there, a lot of big\n\n371\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.770\ncompanies went and grabbed up Class A\naddresses but there were only 127 of them.\n\n372\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.980\nSo those disappeared almost\ninstantaneously, okay?\n\n373\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.680\nBecause they felt like that they\nneeded all those addresses.\n\n374\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.380\nThey really did all disappear\nalmost instantaneously.\n\n375\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.540\nThen there came the idea\nof Class B addresses.\n\n376\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:01.896\nAnd here this actually reduces\ndown the number to 65,534.\n\n377\n00:22:01.896 --> 00:22:04.102\nNow I'm actually subtracting\ntwo numbers out,\n\n378\n00:22:04.102 --> 00:22:06.210\ncuz there's two numbers\nthat you can't use.\n\n379\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.770\nSo it was actually 65,536,\n16,000,216 instead.\n\n380\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.736\nBut there's two numbers you can't use.\n\n381\n00:22:12.736 --> 00:22:18.778\nAnd then, Class C is only 254, okay?\n\n382\n00:22:18.778 --> 00:22:23.700\nSo you start to see where this progression\nwhere there's actually more network bits\n\n383\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.611\ngoing down and\nthat means less number of hosts that\n\n384\n00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:30.770\nare available as more network that's\nout of those 32 are taken up.\n\n385\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.270\nOkay?\n\n386\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.530\nSo we don't tend to\nworry about Class D and\n\n387\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.662\nClass E here as far assigning hosts.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n388\n00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:37.144\n&gt;&gt; Because they're actually for\n\n389\n00:22:37.144 --> 00:22:40.090\nspecial uses is what they're designed for\nas well.\n\n390\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.990\nSo in this particular addressing scheme\nthat you see, it is very important\n\n391\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.010\nthat to understand, at least at\nthe begining, this is the way it was,\n\n392\n00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.780\nthat you had these big addresses and\nyou had to follow those rules.\n\n393\n00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.340\nBut once those rules started to become\na little bit overbearing here, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.030\nThat is when we start to\nhave to do a little bit\n\n395\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.820\nof difference, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So you mean you've started to become\n\n396\n00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.630\na rule breaker, Ronny?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can become a rule breaker,\n\n397\n00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.920\nwe're gonna be tackling that in its\nown kinda little mini series itelf,\n\n398\n00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.020\nwhile where we start breaking the rules.\n\n399\n00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.690\nBut you can see why we\nneeded to break the rules.\n\n400\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.671\nSo for example, let's take a look at\nthe big difference between Class B and\n\n401\n00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:20.865\nClass C.\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's a huge disparity there.\n\n402\n00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:23.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even Class B and Class A is,\n\n403\n00:23:23.446 --> 00:23:24.420\nright?\n\n404\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.380\nSo let's do this for example.\n\n405\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.129\nIn Class B networks,\nI think I actually wrote this down,\n\n406\n00:23:30.129 --> 00:23:33.500\nthere is a possibility of 16,384 networks.\n\n407\n00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.190\nOkay?\n\n408\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.140\nSo that's not bad but\nthat's 16,000 networks here.\n\n409\n00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.168\nNow, what if you actually end\nup having a company, Cherokee,\n\n410\n00:23:42.168 --> 00:23:44.760\nof let's say not 66,000, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.463\nBut let's say, 170,000, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:54.999\nOf these possible computers, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n413\n00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:55.638\n&gt;&gt; On your network.\n\n414\n00:23:55.638 --> 00:23:56.264\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n415\n00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:58.266\nassuming there's no\nClass A addresses left,\n\n416\n00:23:58.266 --> 00:23:59.011\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n417\n00:23:59.011 --> 00:24:02.210\nthere's no Class A addresses left It\nmeant that you had to eat up what?\n\n418\n00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.313\nThree of those, okay, right?\n&gt;&gt; Cha-ching.\n\n419\n00:24:04.313 --> 00:24:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Cha-ching, okay.\n\n420\n00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.497\nSo that doesn't sound bad,\nyou're like okay, so I have 16,000 and\n\n421\n00:24:09.497 --> 00:24:11.700\nyeah I've still got 16,381 addresses.\n\n422\n00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.340\nOkay, so a possibility.\n\n423\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.770\nNow let's go down to Class C here.\n\n424\n00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:21.310\nLet's say that you had a company of,\nlet's say 2,000, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.340\nWell, that Class B-\n&gt;&gt; A little ridiculous, yeah.\n\n426\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I don't have 2,000, so\n\n427\n00:24:26.405 --> 00:24:27.325\ndo I get a Class B?\n\n428\n00:24:27.325 --> 00:24:34.240\nWhat would fit me ideally if I had\n2,000 is 10 Class C networks, right?\n\n429\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.010\nWell if your ISP was only\ngiven a portion of those\n\n430\n00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.340\npossible 2,970,152 networks-\n&gt;&gt; Right, who am I?\n\n431\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n432\n00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:44.890\nlet's say they were given-\n\n433\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:45.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 50 of these.\n\n434\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:45.900\n&gt;&gt; I don't have that kind of clout.\n\n435\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.583\n[LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:47.723\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's say they were given 50 of\n\n437\n00:24:47.723 --> 00:24:51.788\nthese addresses, okay?\n50, that's pretty good, okay,\n\n438\n00:24:51.788 --> 00:24:55.247\nof these Class C addresses.\nWell now they assign ten\n\n439\n00:24:55.247 --> 00:24:57.310\nto you as one customer?\n\n440\n00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.770\nPossible, okay, they could do that.\n\n441\n00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.810\nBut they might go look,\nwe wanna build our business,\n\n442\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.880\nwe want separate customers out there-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah lady.\n\n443\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.837\n&gt;&gt; To be able to do this.\n\n444\n00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:05.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it now actually becomes a little\n\n446\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.830\nbit more hefty.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n447\n00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.130\nthey might not actually\ngive you all those.\n\n448\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.740\nSo what the might say is look,\nI have one Class B here,\n\n449\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.070\nbut you're gonna pay significantly\nmore and you don't need it, okay?\n\n450\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.978\nSo that's why there's\nactually room in between.\n\n451\n00:25:19.978 --> 00:25:23.428\nAnd then we are gonna talk about\nsomething that we call subnetting,\n\n452\n00:25:23.428 --> 00:25:27.244\nwhere we start breaking the rules to\nactually match what we actually really\n\n453\n00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:28.327\nneed.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n454\n00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:32.720\nit is possible that you're actually\ngonna see more of this as we go through.\n\n455\n00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.349\nBut at the very beginning here, we need to\ntalk about this idea of the class we're\n\n456\n00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:40.370\nnetworking first.\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, so I told everyone\n\n457\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.110\nthat it was easy to identify\nthe class based on that first octet.\n\n458\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.640\nDo you wanna take some time to\nexpand on that a little bit?\n\n459\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.771\nWe really are, we need to take some time\nto be able to expand out on this, because\n\n460\n00:25:50.771 --> 00:25:55.168\nat the very beginning, the default subnet\nmask really didn't matter for anybody.\n\n461\n00:25:55.168 --> 00:25:58.452\nBecause of the way that networking\nworked on the internet,\n\n462\n00:25:58.452 --> 00:26:03.280\nthey really did focus in on networking\njust using the first octet here, okay?\n\n463\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.310\nNow the problem that you and\nI have at least at this point,\n\n464\n00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:10.238\nis that we haven't explained how we\nactually arrive at that first octet.\n\n465\n00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n466\n00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.060\n&gt;&gt; And what has to happen here.\n\n467\n00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.008\nSo it means that we have to learn\na little bit of binary map so\n\n468\n00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:21.455\nthat we can understand how these\naddresses come out here, okay?\n\n469\n00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:24.592\nThe great thing is in our library,\nin the ITProTV library,\n\n470\n00:26:24.592 --> 00:26:28.052\nthere's a couple of different\nplaces you can learn them.\n\n471\n00:26:28.052 --> 00:26:30.620\nWe're gonna do a little bit of a review\n\n472\n00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.560\nof how to actually break down\neight bits of binary numbers, and\n\n473\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.132\nthen we'll come back and we'll take a look\nat this idea of what happened here.\n\n474\n00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:42.740\nBecause you'll begin to see patterns\nemerge because of how structured\n\n475\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.540\nthe binary is, and it will be easier\nto identify a Class A, a Class B, and\n\n476\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.770\na Class C address very easily\nif you know the binary as well.\n\n477\n00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.270\nSo when you start to take a look at it,\nthat's where it's gonna begin.\n\n478\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.060\nSo Cherokee though at this\nparticular point in time,\n\n479\n00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.616\nI'm starting to see that I've only got\nthree or four minutes left on the clock,\n\n480\n00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:07.200\nwhich means we don't really have time to\nget into the beginning here of binary.\n\n481\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.644\nSo let's save that for another episode.\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan,\n\n482\n00:27:10.644 --> 00:27:11.819\nI think that's gonna be really fun.\n\n483\n00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:14.707\nI always love taking a look at that,\nbecause Ronnie,\n\n484\n00:27:14.707 --> 00:27:19.006\nyou do a great job of taking something\nthat seems complicated, and showing us,\n\n485\n00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:22.880\nwell, how to make it blacker and white,\nor on or off here in our binary.\n\n486\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.222\nSo thank you for that.\n\n487\n00:27:24.222 --> 00:27:27.610\nYou'll wanna stay tuned for the upcoming\nshow, but for now let's sign out.\n\n488\n00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.800\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n489\n00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.670\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n490\n00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:38.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n491\n00:27:38.062 --> 00:27:40.599\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.472\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:13.090\nYou're watching ITProTV.\nAll right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.530\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.370\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.320\nIn today's episode we're back\nwith more of our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.770\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\nthe man, the myth, the legend,\n\n9\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.450\nas always you know him as Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.190\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.890\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.770\nIt's going great, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.240\nThank you for having me back on the show.\n\n14\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.005\nAs we are picking up now, you didn't start\nthis little kind of mini series with me,\n\n15\n00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.750\nCherokee- [CROSSTALK] I did,\nI was just dressed like Cherokee.\n\n16\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.060\nOkay.\nWell, there you go.\n\n17\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.920\nI'm very good at disguises, so.\n\n18\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.270\nAs well as Cherokee's like a foot and\na half shorter than you, just like I am.\n\n19\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.520\nI don't give away my secrets.\n\n20\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.180\nI know, yeah.\n[LAUGH] But overall though,\n\n21\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.890\nyes, we started on taking\na look at understanding and\n\n22\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.610\napplying IP version 4 addresses.\n\n23\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.080\nSo we did a little bit, right?\n\n24\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.540\nWe actually talked about a lot of\ndifferent things in those first two shows,\n\n25\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.080\nand now we're starting to dive\na little bit more into it.\n\n26\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.038\nAnd we are gonna get into,\nof course, the addressing part now.\n\n27\n00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:06.980\nNow, I spent a lot of time kinda\ngiving you some background and\n\n28\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.820\nhow everything kinda came about.\n\n29\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.555\nAnd once again, easy points for the exam,\n\n30\n00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:16.525\ndon't overlook it just because you go,\nall I need to know is about this.\n\n31\n00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:19.445\nWell, there's easy points that you can\nlikely leave on the table if you don't\n\n32\n00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.015\npay attention, so\njust go back and review those.\n\n33\n00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.655\nIf you have any doubt, any inking at\nall that you're not familiar with these\n\n34\n00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.775\nconcepts, make sure you review that.\n\n35\n00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:28.795\nSo today though,\n\n36\n00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.130\nwhat we're doing is we are picking\nup where we left off last time.\n\n37\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.230\nNow where did we leave off last time,\nand that's kind of the key.\n\n38\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.090\nWe had just talked about the way that\nthese IP addresses were that big pool of\n\n39\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.480\nnumbers, 2 to the 32nd power, a little\nbit under 4.3 billion possible addresses.\n\n40\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.250\nAnd that we just kind of thought we'd\nnever run out of that because if you\n\n41\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.710\nassign every single person on\nthe planet at that point in time,\n\n42\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.220\nthe population was\nprobably about 4 billion.\n\n43\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.270\nYou know, everybody getting\none IP address- Seems legit,\n\n44\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.770\nvery reasonable at that point.\n\n45\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.850\nYeah, it makes sense.\n\n46\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.320\nBut they didn't account for\nwhat happens now.\n\n47\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.360\nThat even with one person, right?\n\n48\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.570\nSo for myself, I have my phone\non me that has an IP address,\n\n49\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.550\nI have my laptop that has an IP address,\nI have an iPad that has an IP address,\n\n50\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.110\nyou name it,\nthose devices start consuming.\n\n51\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.060\nAnd now when you start to do that,\nif 4.4 billion people, let's say,\n\n52\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.520\nwere to have 2 or 3 IP addresses, well\nnow we begin to get into real trouble.\n\n53\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.340\nThen, the other thing that ended up\nhappening, of course, is that they said,\n\n54\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.510\nlook, we've got to manage\nthis a little bit better.\n\n55\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.080\nSo they started implementing of\ncourse what we call classes, and\n\n56\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.220\nclasses were designed to help businesses\nget the IP addresses that they needed.\n\n57\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.488\nAnd we talked about class rule addressing\nor classes that they have out there,\n\n58\n00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:48.553\nwhich is a class A, class B, class C,\nI even added in a class D and class E for\n\n59\n00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:49.780\ncompletion.\n\n60\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.510\nBut remember that we've talked about it.\n\n61\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.500\nIf you're going, that doesn't sound\nfamiliar, Ronnie, I jumped into Part Three\n\n62\n00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.380\non purpose, well you might want to\ngo back and check out Part Two.\n\n63\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.070\nWe're not going to review everything here,\nso you'll get to go back and see that.\n\n64\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.082\nBut remember that right at the beginning,\nthat's what we're talking about,\n\n65\n00:03:05.082 --> 00:03:08.643\nis that those particular classes,\nalso by restricting them,\n\n66\n00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:13.050\nthey ended up starting to eat up addresses\nquickly, as well as the companies that\n\n67\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.130\nstarted realizing they didn't have all\nof the actual networks that they needed.\n\n68\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.550\nSo, for example, we used in the class\nA that there's only 126 class A addresses.\n\n69\n00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.260\nSo one big company out there said,\nI need a class A address.\n\n70\n00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.360\nWell that reduces that,\nand it didn't take long.\n\n71\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.150\nThe class A address has pretty much\njust disappeared almost overnight,\n\n72\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.950\nclass B started going very rapidly, and\nthen that left that class C address even\n\n73\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.250\nthough there were over two million\npossible networks out there.\n\n74\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.040\nThe Internet grew at such a rate that\nit was like, that's just insane.\n\n75\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.110\nThey were disappearing rapidly.\n\n76\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.300\nSo at that point,\nthen stuff started to happen and\n\n77\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.260\nthey started to realize that they\nneeded to change some different things.\n\n78\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.400\nBut before we got into that point, and\nthat's where today's episode picks up,\n\n79\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.698\nis that we need to be able to\nidentify these class A, class B, and\n\n80\n00:04:01.698 --> 00:04:07.480\nclass C addresses very easily because\nthese are easy points on the exam.\n\n81\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.250\nAnd so, the easiest way, Daniel,\nby far, just by simple sheer number,\n\n82\n00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.000\nis to memorize the table that we\ndrew up in Part 2 of this episode.\n\n83\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.510\nMemorize the Class A, B, and C, and you'll\nbe fine, and you'll be able to do that.\n\n84\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.660\nUntil they go, hey,\nhere's what we're also gonna do instead,\n\n85\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.520\nDaniel- They're gonna throw\nyou a curve ball, aren't they?\n\n86\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.150\nThey gonna throw this kind\nof this screw ball like.\n\n87\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.580\nOkay, so you need to identify this as\na class B address, which one of these, and\n\n88\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.258\nthe answers are all gonna be in binary.\n\n89\n00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:44.210\n[LAUGH] So Daniel, even though I\ngave you a table, I gave everybody\n\n90\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.810\na table to memorize, when I did that,\nI didn't account for the binary.\n\n91\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.220\nAnd so now you going, well, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.440\nAnd they show me all binary numbers,\nif I don't know how to convert that,\n\n93\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.190\nthen you kind of are going\nto miss some points easily.\n\n94\n00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.460\nSo we need to spend a little bit of time,\nof course then,\n\n95\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.922\nhaving to learn something that most of\nus didn't learn in school at this point,\n\n96\n00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:10.570\nis binary, so that's what we have to do.\n\n97\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.300\nSo Daniel, are you ready?\n\n98\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.410\nThis is an exciting trip.\n\n99\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.825\nI've got my helmet on,\nand I am strapped up.\n\n100\n00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:19.700\n[LAUGH] It is an exciting trip, and\nat first glance you're gonna be like, wow,\n\n101\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.640\nthis seems really complex.\n\n102\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.730\nBut all of a sudden,\nonce you get a couple of concepts to it,\n\n103\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.550\nit comes really easy, and\nyou'll be able to do it fairly quickly.\n\n104\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.120\nRight, yeah, and so\nyou do have to take time.\n\n105\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.820\nAnd the thing is,\npractice- Right, practice.\n\n106\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820\nIs just kinda the key here.\n\n107\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.320\nMost of us didn't grow up learning binary,\nbut we grew up, though,\n\n108\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.080\nis learning decimal numbers, right?\n\n109\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.630\nBut let's take a look at my white\nboard that I've created using Notepad.\n\n110\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.805\nI know I'm kinda cheap on this, right?\n\n111\n00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:47.690\n[LAUGH] No fancy software here,\nit's just plain notepad.\n\n112\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.220\nAnd you might be going, Ronnie,\nwhy don't you kind of use Excel and all.\n\n113\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.710\nYou can, if you want to, but- This is\nprobably the easiest way to do it.\n\n114\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.610\nIt's the easiest way to do it, but\nthe other thing is when you go into\n\n115\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.200\nthe exam booth and\nyou're trying to do these conversions.\n\n116\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.010\nYou ain't got Excel.\n\n117\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.670\nYou ain't got Excel.\n\n118\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.000\n[LAUGH] You've got a, shoot, a dry erase,\na laminated paper, and a dry erase marker.\n\n119\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.520\nWait a minute, my Excel functions\njust used to do this conversion for\n\n120\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.200\nme naturally.\n\n121\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.790\nSo you're not gonna be able to do that.\n\n122\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.640\nYeah. Okay? That's what it comes down to,\nbut let's go ahead and start here.\n\n123\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.090\nSo I just started with this,\nessentially a clean sheet of paper.\n\n124\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.440\nSo the numbering system that you and\nI pretty much ended up learning during our\n\n125\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.290\ngrammar school days is what\nwe call base 10 numbering.\n\n126\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.710\nAnd that means that there are ten\npossible combinations of digits.\n\n127\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.300\nAnd they include, of course,\n0 and, of course, 1 through 9, so,\n\n128\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.180\nthat's ten digits all together.\n\n129\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.210\nNow, Daniel,\nI made a tiny little table here for\n\n130\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.340\nus to make sure that we can\nunderstand these concepts, as well.\n\n131\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.200\nNow Daniel, I only used two\nof those ten digits, right?\n\n132\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.720\nA 1 and a 0 in each one of these rows.\n\n133\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.120\nYou did.\nBut Daniel this first number though,\n\n134\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.010\njust looking at it from what we know,\nwhat is that number?\n\n135\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.310\nThat first number is 1000.\n\n136\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.140\nIs 1000, okay?\n\n137\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.610\nThe second number, [LAUGH] I'm not\ntesting your gigantic math ability, but\n\n138\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.410\njust to make sure we make the point.\n\n139\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.991\nThat we're all on the same page,\nthat's 100.\n\n140\n00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:05.870\nYup.\nAnd then third?\n\n141\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.950\nIs 10, and then 1.\n\n142\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.210\nAnd then 1, okay.\n\n143\n00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.460\nSo that all makes sense, but\nwe have to kinda remember, why?\n\n144\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.650\nSince we're only using- Why\ndo we say that that's 1000?\n\n145\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.280\nWhy do we say that's 100?\n\n146\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.090\nYeah, right.\nThere's rules that are being applied,\n\n147\n00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.210\nwe're doing it automatically\nbecause we're so used to it.\n\n148\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.040\nThere's a rule that says,\nthis is why that's 1000,\n\n149\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.940\nthis is why it's 100 and so on.\n\n150\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.740\nRight, and that's what we want to get to.\n\n151\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.840\nIs that we want you to understand,\nwhen you look at this.\n\n152\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.900\nThere's a reason why that's 1000, there's\na reason why that's 100, 10, and 1.\n\n153\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.600\nAnd that is because they\nare actually put into these columns,\n\n154\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.110\nas you actually line them up, right.\n\n155\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.572\nIf you remember doing this in school,\nwhere you lined up these columns,\n\n156\n00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:46.449\nthat's because each of these columns gives\nus what we call a place value, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:51.260\nAnd that place value actually comes,\nif you actually start from the right-hand\n\n158\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.300\nside going to the left-hand side, that\nactually had the least significant value.\n\n159\n00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.233\nSo this first column right here is\nrepresented by what we call the ones\n\n160\n00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:02.775\nplace value, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:05.740\nSo that value is equal to a single digit.\n\n162\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.515\nBut once we move into two-place values\nhere that becomes the tens place value,\n\n163\n00:08:11.515 --> 00:08:12.039\nokay?\n\n164\n00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:16.530\nAnd then the third one for us 100,\nand then the fourth one here is 1,000.\n\n165\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.373\nWe continue to move up, right?\n\n166\n00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:21.860\nAnd it goes to 10,000, 100,000, millions.\n\n167\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.852\nRight, so on and so forth.\n\n168\n00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.610\nSo on, yeah, and you continue to do that.\n\n169\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.714\nOff into infinity.\n\n170\n00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:29.810\nAnd this is an important concept as\nwe start to take a look at binary.\n\n171\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.484\nAnd the reason why is because with binary,\nand the convertions that we're doing, and\n\n172\n00:08:34.484 --> 00:08:35.904\nfor you learning binary.\n\n173\n00:08:35.904 --> 00:08:39.970\nYou gotta know these place values too, but\nyou have to know them in binary, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.085\nAnd that's the key here.\n\n175\n00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:44.470\nSo let me take away this cuz I was\nactually talking about something else.\n\n176\n00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.242\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, I was doing something\nelse though that I was thinking about.\n\n177\n00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:49.635\nI was like, Ronnie's got some\nwires crossed going on there, but\n\n178\n00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:50.603\nI'll let him get to that.\n\n179\n00:08:50.603 --> 00:08:52.180\nRight.\nBut just remember that.\n\n180\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.366\nPlace values, if you can remember that,\n\n181\n00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:57.246\nhey when I look at a number\nthere's place values here.\n\n182\n00:08:57.246 --> 00:09:01.170\nThen you can take a look at binary and\nyou can also learn about this, too.\n\n183\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.651\nAnd the reason why it becomes\nfrightening at the very beginning for\n\n184\n00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:04.543\nmost people is simple.\n\n185\n00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:05.986\nDaniel, for four [INAUDIBLE] okay?\n\n186\n00:09:05.986 --> 00:09:08.447\nI automatically just didn't\neven have to think about it,\n\n187\n00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.720\nyou knew that it was 1,000\njust by looking at it.\n\n188\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.430\nI did.\n\n189\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.322\nBut when I now say Daniel, you've\ngotta learn eight binary place values.\n\n190\n00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:20.910\nAll of a sudden, your mind goes what\nthe heck is eight decimal places?\n\n191\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.433\nWhat is the value for\neight decimal places just right away?\n\n192\n00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:26.008\nRight.\nAnd now you're going is that,\n\n193\n00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:27.070\nwhat is that?\n\n194\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.041\nAnd you start thinking my gosh,\nwe've gotta learn that many?\n\n195\n00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:32.330\nNo you don't, okay?\n\n196\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.200\nAnd the reason why is that in binary okay,\n\n197\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.711\nyou don't have zero through nine\nto actually worry about in terms\n\n198\n00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:44.404\nof the numbers that can be in every\nsingle place value that you have.\n\n199\n00:09:44.404 --> 00:09:49.060\nYou only have the zero or a one or a zero.\n\n200\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.773\nSo that's the idea.\n\n201\n00:09:49.773 --> 00:09:55.133\nBase 2 says hey, this is two bases,\nand then what is the place value?\n\n202\n00:09:55.133 --> 00:09:57.821\nSo there's only two values that it could\npossibly be is what you're saying.\n\n203\n00:09:57.821 --> 00:10:00.689\nRight.\nSo the great thing is as we look at this\n\n204\n00:10:00.689 --> 00:10:05.197\nand even though our IP addresses\nare 32-bit binary numbers, and\n\n205\n00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:10.152\nif I were to have to convert that,\nDaniel, I would cry- [LAUGH] To try and\n\n206\n00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:14.530\nthink what size number would I\nactually memorize to do that?\n\n207\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.465\nBut the way that they talk about it and\nthe way that we talk about it is that to\n\n208\n00:10:18.465 --> 00:10:22.400\nmake it easier for you and me,\nI said let's take that 32-bit number and\n\n209\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.557\nlet's just divide it up into eight places,\nor octets is what they call them.\n\n210\n00:10:26.557 --> 00:10:30.257\nSo it reduces the actual numbers\nthat I have to memorize or\n\n211\n00:10:30.257 --> 00:10:32.840\nlearn in terms of the conversion.\n\n212\n00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.493\nSo the great thing is in numbering,\nokay at least in network numbering, and\n\n213\n00:10:37.493 --> 00:10:41.506\nwith IP version 4, you only have\nto memorize up to eight places.\n\n214\n00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:45.400\nYou don't have to worry about the 10\nmillion and then the billion to trillion.\n\n215\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.064\nAnd then the trillions to what ever\ncomes after trillions at this point.\n\n216\n00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:48.861\nRight.\nAnd plus,\n\n217\n00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:51.187\nit's not like the machine is\nsitting there going, well,\n\n218\n00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:54.210\nI'm gonna try to figure this out to\nthe bazillionth place, you know.\n\n219\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.548\nIt's just saying this is a value that\ngives me instructions to do something.\n\n220\n00:10:57.548 --> 00:10:59.764\nYeah.\nWe have broken that value down into\n\n221\n00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:03.815\nsomething that you and I and Ronnie here\ncan logically work our way through as\n\n222\n00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:06.060\nhumans in our limited capacity for math.\n\n223\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.393\nObviously, there's a of things- Right.\n\n224\n00:11:07.393 --> 00:11:10.998\n[LAUGH] We are not that and\nnormal people aren't savants, so\n\n225\n00:11:10.998 --> 00:11:15.055\ndoing it in a way that they created\nthe system can be very, very helpful for\n\n226\n00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:17.100\nus working with such large numbers.\n\n227\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.632\nRight.\nSo\n\n228\n00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:21.230\nhere is the key to understanding binary,\nat least for me.\n\n229\n00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.852\nAnd as far as,\nwhen I've been teaching now for\n\n230\n00:11:23.852 --> 00:11:26.138\nover a decade plus now in teaching this,\n\n231\n00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:30.727\nyou've got to memorize these eight place\nvalues we are about to put down, okay?\n\n232\n00:11:30.727 --> 00:11:35.140\nThat is pretty much the key here when\nwe start to do something like this.\n\n233\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.626\nNow if you can memorize\nthese eight place values,\n\n234\n00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:43.441\nthere is not a single binary question\non the exam that will throw you.\n\n235\n00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:44.960\nI hope that gives you confidence.\n\n236\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.540\nIt should.\nSo it should give you confidence.\n\n237\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.280\nNow you will see some other numbers\nthat people will throw in there.\n\n238\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.543\nBut overall, though if you can memorize\nthis most of the time you're not gonna\n\n239\n00:11:53.543 --> 00:11:56.070\nhave to ever worry about\nanything else here, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.754\nBut at this point,\nup to eight binary place values,\n\n241\n00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:01.291\nyou're probably gonna be pretty good.\n\n242\n00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:04.903\nSays that our clock system is\nbased on a 60, a base 60 system,\n\n243\n00:12:04.903 --> 00:12:07.040\nlet me make sure I get this right.\n\n244\n00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.068\nSexagesimal.\n\n245\n00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:09.660\nYeah, so that's neat.\n\n246\n00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.975\nThat's cool, I understand that.\n\n247\n00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:13.914\nAnd I would not have ever known\nthat except that for somebody, and\n\n248\n00:12:13.914 --> 00:12:16.852\nour viewers which are some of\nthe brightest viewers in the world,\n\n249\n00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:19.910\napparently, that give us\ninformation right here on our show.\n\n250\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.755\nBut there you go, so memorize this\nidea of the eight place values.\n\n251\n00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:28.179\nNow because of the limitation of Notepad I\nhad to type from left to right, but\n\n252\n00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:32.280\nlet's go ahead and\nstart setting up these place values, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.869\nSo remember that when we start\ntalking about place values,\n\n254\n00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:41.479\nthey're the same as what we see\nin the base ten here, okay?\n\n255\n00:12:41.479 --> 00:12:44.738\nOkay, let me see, I'm trying to make it so\nthat we can see it.\n\n256\n00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:50.849\nWe'll all start right here,\n128 is the highest place value.\n\n257\n00:12:50.849 --> 00:12:51.790\nThen 64, 30, oops.\n\n258\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.820\nNo.\n[LAUGH] I skipped.\n\n259\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:01.368\nWhat the heck did I do there?\n\n260\n00:13:01.368 --> 00:13:03.120\n32, 16, 8, 4, 2.\n\n261\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.204\nAnd then 1, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:05.204 --> 00:13:08.020\nThose are the values you\njust have to memorize.\n\n263\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.606\nThere's no other way to actually\nthink about how to do this.\n\n264\n00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:16.760\nOnce you actually get this done,\nthe neat thing about this, right?\n\n265\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.259\nIs that I can automatically\ngive you a binary number, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:25.370\nAnd we can begin pretty much\nthe conversion of what we see here.\n\n267\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.867\nSo let me make a sort of table,\nis what we are actually doing.\n\n268\n00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:33.938\nAt this point, so\nI'll just put some dividers here,\n\n269\n00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.390\njust to help us out a little bit.\n\n270\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.172\nAll right, now I recommend that\nif you want to start immediately,\n\n271\n00:13:43.172 --> 00:13:47.792\ncuz within the next minute or two,\nafter I get everything lined up here,\n\n272\n00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:52.190\nyou'll end up seeing exactly\nhow this can work out for you.\n\n273\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.496\nAnd your goal is simple, okay?\n\n274\n00:13:54.496 --> 00:13:58.126\nOnce you can memorize this\nbasic concept at this point,\n\n275\n00:13:58.126 --> 00:14:00.470\nyou have to get fast at doing it.\n\n276\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.952\nAnd that's kind of the key here.\n\n277\n00:14:01.952 --> 00:14:04.890\nSo, you want to memorize\nthese place values.\n\n278\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.582\nNow, at this point,\nwhen you start here, let's go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:12.073\nshow you how quickly that this\ncan actually develop here.\n\n280\n00:14:12.073 --> 00:14:19.830\nSo with 128 here, okay, we can go ahead\nand start doing some different numbers.\n\n281\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.175\nSo let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n282\n00:14:22.175 --> 00:14:24.620\nSo let me line this up once again.\n\n283\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.020\nMake sure I get this kind of set up here,\nso that we can see this.\n\n284\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.221\nAnd it'll make it easy in the end\nhere once I get situated here.\n\n285\n00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:42.295\nI wanna do zeros.\n\n286\n00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:48.646\nI apparently don't want to do zeros.\n\n287\n00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:51.020\n[CROSSTALK] I wanna do parentheses,\nI wanna do.\n\n288\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.298\nLegend of your typing goes far and\nwide is known to,\n\n289\n00:14:54.298 --> 00:14:59.340\ngrandpeople tell their children,\nand their children's children.\n\n290\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.902\nAnd it'll bring people seizures.\n\n291\n00:15:00.902 --> 00:15:02.230\nAnd it will, yeah.\n\n292\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.166\nThere's no doubt.\n\n293\n00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:03.997\nThat's right.\n\n294\n00:15:03.997 --> 00:15:05.620\nMy ability to get around a keyboard.\n\n295\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.160\nWhen Ronnie is typing we\nshould put a disclaimer up.\n\n296\n00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.015\nLook away from the screen\nif you have epilepsy.\n\n297\n00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:10.666\n[LAUGH] It's terrible.\n\n298\n00:15:10.666 --> 00:15:12.750\nAll right, so let's just start with this.\n\n299\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.666\nSo there it is, Daniel.\n\n300\n00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:15.630\nAs I look at this, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.629\nThat number might look intimidating if I\nwere just to string this altogether and\n\n302\n00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:20.951\nnot have the spaces in it.\n\n303\n00:15:20.951 --> 00:15:24.400\nBut, when you start to\nactually do conversion, right?\n\n304\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.896\nIf I needed to convert this to\na number that's a networking, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:31.096\nThe only thing that we do is once we\nlearned this particular table here and\n\n306\n00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:33.950\nwe memorize these in\nthese eight place values.\n\n307\n00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:39.759\nIs that if I have a one in the 128 column\nI just start adding from left to right,\n\n308\n00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:43.332\nand then that gives me what\nthe value is gonna be.\n\n309\n00:15:43.332 --> 00:15:46.630\nSo, in this one, Daniel,\nvery simply, right?\n\n310\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.668\nZeros we don't count.\n\n311\n00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:48.513\nRight.\nOnes we do\n\n312\n00:15:48.513 --> 00:15:50.578\nit makes sense at this point, right?\n\n313\n00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:55.829\nIs that all we have to do at this point\nthen is to say that equals to well,\n\n314\n00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:58.857\n128, which is now me behind my head.\n\n315\n00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:02.653\nOkay.\nSo that actually does make some sense.\n\n316\n00:16:02.653 --> 00:16:04.101\nSo if you continue and\n\n317\n00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:09.250\nI'm actually doing kind of the next couple\nhere because I want you to see that\n\n318\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.576\nthat means that you can also start to\nidentify patterns that can exist as well.\n\n319\n00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:23.144\nBut now if I add this one in here, and\nthen the rest of these as being 0s.\n\n320\n00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:25.270\nLet me see if I can.\n\n321\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.085\nYou may have done yourself a favor by\ncopying and pasting the line above that.\n\n322\n00:16:29.085 --> 00:16:30.360\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I know.\n\n323\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.909\nSave a lot of typing.\n\n324\n00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:38.061\nSo Daniel, if I start to do\nsomething like this, right?\n\n325\n00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:38.660\nYep.\n\n326\n00:16:41.927 --> 00:16:45.491\nBut Daniel, the other rule that I gave\nyou, not only by memorizing these, but\n\n327\n00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:47.600\nnow by doing something like this here.\n\n328\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.200\nI said that if we want to actually\nsee what an eight digit binary number\n\n329\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.570\nends up being,\nall we have to do is add up what?\n\n330\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.180\nThe ones that are in the place values,\nright?\n\n331\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.009\nSo this one would be 128 + 64 and if you\ndo that with the math and everything,\n\n332\n00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:03.296\nthat comes out to be one 192, yep.\n\n333\n00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:04.494\n192.\nYeah, 192.\n\n334\n00:17:04.494 --> 00:17:11.020\nAnd so you'll begin to see that's\nexactly what starts to happen.\n\n335\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.780\nNow, we're not gonna do\nthe rest of the table, but\n\n336\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.220\nas far as simple conversion goes.\n\n337\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.870\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] It doesn't equals 64, equals 192.\n\n338\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.846\n192, crap.\n\n339\n00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.529\n[LAUGH] See, told you,\ntold you I'd mess up.\n\n340\n00:17:21.529 --> 00:17:22.878\nThe pointing and laughing has begun.\n\n341\n00:17:22.878 --> 00:17:25.410\n[LAUGH] Of course, so here it is.\n\n342\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.910\nAs you start to break this down and you\nstart to see that, notice that every time\n\n343\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.040\nI add from the left to the right,\nthe number continues to increase.\n\n344\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.540\nNow there will be times\nwhen that won't happen.\n\n345\n00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.160\nSo for example,\na very common number that we might have.\n\n346\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.920\nSo let's do this for\nthe rest of this, right.\n\n347\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.549\nSo let's say that I'm given a bin or\nan actual IP address and\n\n348\n00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:49.469\nthe IP address looks like this,\n192.168.0.10.\n\n349\n00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:52.310\nIt's something just as simple as that.\n\n350\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.730\nNow, I've thrown a little bit of a loop.\n\n351\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.890\nThe great thing is we already know\nwhat 192 is, right, on the second row.\n\n352\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.740\nSo we've already figured that one out.\n\n353\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.740\nNow what if I actually need to figure out,\nwell, how do I convert the next one?\n\n354\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.010\nWell, the next one is fairly\nsimple at this point, which is 0.\n\n355\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.486\nWhich means all of these end up being 0,\nright?\n\n356\n00:18:12.486 --> 00:18:14.847\nAt least I think it does.\n\n357\n00:18:17.287 --> 00:18:22.263\nMy ability to actually even copy and\npaste is now terrible.\n\n358\n00:18:22.263 --> 00:18:23.855\n[LAUGH] Is suspect.\n\n359\n00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:26.558\nYeah, it is suspect at this point.\n\n360\n00:18:26.558 --> 00:18:31.470\nLet me convert that,\nso now we have the a 0.\n\n361\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.560\nSuper easy, right?\n\n362\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.410\nNow, that one's fairly easy but\n\n363\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.270\nthe 168, I skipped over that\nbecause it makes sense, right?\n\n364\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.820\nYeah.\nSo\n\n365\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.760\nthe very fact is when you start\ndoing certain things here.\n\n366\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.590\nNow what if I was given 168 and\nnow I'm given a decimal number and\n\n367\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.126\nI need to convert it to Binary, well,\n\n368\n00:18:49.126 --> 00:18:53.636\nit's simple at this point, once again,\nis that we would do the same thing here.\n\n369\n00:18:53.636 --> 00:18:56.900\nLet me just copy and paste, and\nwe'll change the numbers as we go along.\n\n370\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.960\nSo all I need to do is\nI begin subtracting.\n\n371\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.880\nI take 168 and I subtract out\nwhat I can at this point, right?\n\n372\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.730\nSo if I take 168 and I subtract out 128,\nthat leaves me with 40.\n\n373\n00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.170\nWhich means I can put a 1 here,\nbecause I will use it.\n\n374\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.900\nSo you're saying start with the number\nthat we'll actually subtract,\n\n375\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.519\nthe highest number that we'll subtract.\n\n376\n00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.069\nRight.\n\n377\n00:19:18.069 --> 00:19:23.060\nSo if it was 122, 128 is too high.\n\n378\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:23.999\nRight.\nIt has the number, so\n\n379\n00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:26.518\nyou go with the first one that\ndoesn't beyond what the numbers you're\n\n380\n00:19:26.518 --> 00:19:27.081\nworking with.\n\n381\n00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:28.041\nRight.\nGot you.\n\n382\n00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.619\nSo at this point that's what you would\ndo is that you would actually be able to\n\n383\n00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:31.320\nsubtract that out.\n\n384\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.210\nIf you can't subtract it out because\nnumber is too big then that gets a 0.\n\n385\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:34.731\nCorrect.\n\n386\n00:19:34.731 --> 00:19:35.684\nAll right.\nOkay, so\n\n387\n00:19:35.684 --> 00:19:39.830\nfrom this point here I don't need the 64\nbecause I know that would give me 192.\n\n388\n00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.460\nSo I put a 0 there instead.\n\n389\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:48.137\nThen 128 plus 32 though,\nthat would get me 160.\n\n390\n00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:53.889\nSo then I can simply change that now it's\n160, I don't have to worry about the 16,\n\n391\n00:19:53.889 --> 00:19:58.110\nbut since I'm trying to get 168,\nI've already got 160.\n\n392\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.490\n160 plus 8.\n8 and hey, there you go.\n\n393\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.074\nWe're at the station.\n\n394\n00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:03.760\n168, okay?\n\n395\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.590\nSo just a few simple examples.\n\n396\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.850\nNow every once in a while,\nnot Cisco land so much, right?\n\n397\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.306\nBut every once in a while in the land\nof everything- [LAUGH] CompTIA and\n\n398\n00:20:14.306 --> 00:20:15.490\neverything.\n\n399\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.980\nYou may see where they're like hey,\nin regular numbering systems, so\n\n400\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.110\nlike base 10, okay?\n\n401\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.723\nIn theory there's what?\n\n402\n00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:24.053\nAn unlimited number of leading 0s.\n\n403\n00:20:24.053 --> 00:20:24.637\nCorrect.\n\n404\n00:20:24.637 --> 00:20:26.810\nThat's out there,\njust all the way out there.\n\n405\n00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.300\nBut notice we don't tend to report them,\nokay?\n\n406\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.270\nIn binary they could do the same thing but\nin Cisco they always do the eight\n\n407\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.320\ndigits as far as I can actually\nremember doing this, right?\n\n408\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.910\nSo what about the number ten\nthat I'm given right here?\n\n409\n00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.060\nHow would I convert something like that?\n\n410\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.470\nWell, if I was in a quick\nhurry I could in theory\n\n411\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.938\njust come back and populate this.\n\n412\n00:20:51.938 --> 00:20:54.520\nOops, I said that.\n\n413\n00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.930\nAnybody else could probably quickly do it,\nbut Ronnie not so much and this one,\n\n414\n00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:08.625\nAnd then in between, So\nthat you might see something like that.\n\n415\n00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:10.590\nNow, like I said, in Cisco land though,\n\n416\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.254\nyou'd actually end up seeing the rest\nof these also being populated as 0s.\n\n417\n00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:15.974\nThat's what would happen.\n\n418\n00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:29.070\nFirst tab.\n\n419\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.840\nI know- [LAUGH] Why not?\n\n420\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.460\nWhy not keep running\nwhile I'm still around?\n\n421\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.120\n[LAUGH] It's fine.\n\n422\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.960\nI'm used to it,\n\n423\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.590\nbecause I know my typing is not exactly\nthe greatest in the world at doing this.\n\n424\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.700\nAll right, so\nthat is just basic conversion.\n\n425\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.530\nNow if you can memorize that,\nso we showed you both ways.\n\n426\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.770\nWe showed you two of them, converting\n\n427\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.570\nthe binary number that we're given and\nthen converting it into a decimal number.\n\n428\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.070\nThen we showed you two where it was\nactually the decimal number and\n\n429\n00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.840\nconverting it into binary.\n\n430\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.000\nIf you can memorize that on those\nfour sets of eight digits each,\n\n431\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.580\nyou'll end up seeing that\nthat's what you'll get.\n\n432\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.040\nNow what about the last one.\n\n433\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.560\nNow these are kind of special ones\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n434\n00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.340\nNow Daniel, if I were to do all\nof them as being binary ones,\n\n435\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.830\nokay, this will tell you what\nthe highest number that you and\n\n436\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.860\nI can achieve by using the eight digits,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.981\nIf I turn them all on, in other words,\nif they become binary ones\n\n438\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.050\nOkay, so we change all this to ones.\n\n439\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.250\nIt's still the same,\nyou just do the simple addition.\n\n440\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.420\nAnd you wanna practice this.\n\n441\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.380\nLike crazy, you wanna practice this, okay?\n\n442\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.280\nSo Daniel, the way that I learned\nhow to do this, is you and\n\n443\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.140\nI, we used to teach at night sometimes,\nright?\n\n444\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.650\nYeah.\n\n445\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.590\nAnd it used to be long nights.\n\n446\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.130\nBut when I was first learning this,\n\n447\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:06.030\nwhen I was just an application I\nwanna become a technical instructor.\n\n448\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.400\nI knew I had to learn this.\n\n449\n00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.450\nSo I started driving home at night, and\n\n450\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.200\nI would start to actually\ndo this in my head.\n\n451\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.990\nAnd Daniel could actually remember when I\ngo, Daniel give me a subnetting problem.\n\n452\n00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.048\nAnd I'd go home and I'd try and\nfigure it out and go, Daniel, hear this,\n\n453\n00:23:21.048 --> 00:23:22.505\nis that the right answer?\n\n454\n00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:24.051\nAnd he'd go, heck no,\nthat's not the right answer.\n\n455\n00:23:24.051 --> 00:23:28.460\n[LAUGH] But you would start to see this,\nright, it would start to actually happen.\n\n456\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.790\nAnd then after a while, I started being\nable to see this table in my head.\n\n457\n00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.652\nAnd then I could actually do that.\n\n458\n00:23:32.652 --> 00:23:36.074\nSo when I started doing this going\nall right, so how do I do this?\n\n459\n00:23:36.074 --> 00:23:38.457\n128 plus 64 is 192.\n\n460\n00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:41.303\n192 plus 32 is 224.\n\n461\n00:23:41.303 --> 00:23:44.292\n224 plus 16 is 240.\n\n462\n00:23:44.292 --> 00:23:46.324\n240 + 8 is 248.\n\n463\n00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:48.989\n248 + 4, 252.\n\n464\n00:23:48.989 --> 00:23:55.364\n252 + 2, 254, and then 254 + 1, 255.\n\n465\n00:23:55.364 --> 00:23:58.198\nSo I started actually\nbeing able to do that.\n\n466\n00:23:58.198 --> 00:24:02.069\nAnd then once you get to that,\nand you start seeing that, hey,\n\n467\n00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:04.568\nthe lowest value that I can have is what?\n\n468\n00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:05.765\nZeros.\n\n469\n00:24:05.765 --> 00:24:06.657\nWhich is all zeros.\n\n470\n00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:11.986\nAnd then the highest number in 8 bits of\nbinary that I can also come out with,\n\n471\n00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:12.832\nis 255.\n\n472\n00:24:12.832 --> 00:24:14.456\nBecause the next place would be 256.\n\n473\n00:24:14.456 --> 00:24:18.312\nYep, the next place would be 256, which\nwould actually be higher than that which\n\n474\n00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:20.986\nwas no longer 8 bits of binary\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n475\n00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:23.106\nRight.\nBut this is actually key.\n\n476\n00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:27.274\nIf you can memorize that, and you can\nstart putting yourself into drills,\n\n477\n00:24:27.274 --> 00:24:31.459\nyou're gonna see that it's gonna be\nrelatively easy to identify, okay?\n\n478\n00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:34.470\nBut being able to do this with\nthe table at the beginning,\n\n479\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.943\nI know it sounds a little bit slow,\nbut it actually does help you.\n\n480\n00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:39.833\nAnd then after a while,\nyou just take that away.\n\n481\n00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:43.045\nAnd you just kinda got,\nhere's the table in my mind.\n\n482\n00:24:43.045 --> 00:24:48.051\nAnd you go, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n\n483\n00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:49.665\nMm-hm.\nOnce you start doing that,\n\n484\n00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:52.631\nthen you can start actually\nseeing where you place ones, and\n\n485\n00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:54.273\nthen you add them up in your head.\n\n486\n00:24:54.273 --> 00:24:57.457\nAnd you go, Ronnie,\nis that gonna be key for the exam?\n\n487\n00:24:57.457 --> 00:24:59.001\nYes, okay?\n\n488\n00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:03.545\nI hate to throw this at any of us\nthat have a problem with math.\n\n489\n00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:07.073\nBut the very fact is, what you need to\nstart focusing in on with something like\n\n490\n00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:10.387\nthis, especially in just about every\nquestion that you're gonna get,\n\n491\n00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:11.827\nis about minute per question.\n\n492\n00:25:11.827 --> 00:25:13.794\nSo converting 8 bits of binary,\n\n493\n00:25:13.794 --> 00:25:16.689\nit shouldn't take you any\nlonger than a minute.\n\n494\n00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:20.109\nOnce you start to do that, that's\nactually gonna be key here, all right?\n\n495\n00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:24.191\nNow Daniel, I'm kind of bringing this\naround cuz I mentioned it in part two.\n\n496\n00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:24.855\nMm-hm.\n\n497\n00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:28.794\nWe talked about the idea of classful\naddresses, and that with those classful\n\n498\n00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:32.804\naddresses is what also started happening\non the Internet was routing, okay?\n\n499\n00:25:32.804 --> 00:25:37.172\nNow the way that routing used to be\nwas all done by using those classful\n\n500\n00:25:37.172 --> 00:25:38.009\naddresses.\n\n501\n00:25:38.009 --> 00:25:41.837\nAnd the reason why that's key is because\nit means you have to be able to identify\n\n502\n00:25:41.837 --> 00:25:44.276\nthose very quickly to\nactually get those routes.\n\n503\n00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:47.451\nAnd that's how the computers did it,\nis that they identified them relatively\n\n504\n00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:50.740\nquickly, didn't have to worry about other\nthings that they had to worry about.\n\n505\n00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.728\nNow when we start taking a look at\ncertain things that are out there, right?\n\n506\n00:25:54.728 --> 00:25:57.647\nYou start to realize something\nabout Class A addresses.\n\n507\n00:25:57.647 --> 00:26:02.137\nSo let me see if I can do this\na little bit quickly here.\n\n508\n00:26:02.137 --> 00:26:05.124\nSo on the Class A address, okay?\n\n509\n00:26:05.124 --> 00:26:10.459\nThis is actually from 1 through 127,\nright?\n\n510\n00:26:10.459 --> 00:26:11.870\n1 through 127.\n\n511\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.676\nAnd let's take a look at our table again\nhere, and let's just get a 1 up here.\n\n512\n00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:21.229\nAnd then with 127, this is\nsomething that's a little bit more,\n\n513\n00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:24.335\nlet me do it the other way,\ncuz it's actually right down here.\n\n514\n00:26:24.335 --> 00:26:27.653\nLet me change that back.\n\n515\n00:26:27.653 --> 00:26:33.476\nThis is what 127 looks like\ndown here at the bottom, okay?\n\n516\n00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:37.669\nSo now that we have this right,\nwhat you actually notice is that with\n\n517\n00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:41.936\na Class A address, you have 1,\nthat actually after the beginning,\n\n518\n00:26:41.936 --> 00:26:44.971\nthe very highest bit here\nis actually being a 0.\n\n519\n00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:51.058\nAnd now notice that the highest number\ninside of a 127, also begins with a 0.\n\n520\n00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:56.311\nSo for Class A addresses, if you can\nidentify a Class A address, it's simple.\n\n521\n00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:58.786\nIf you go, crap,\nI can't remember, is it 128?\n\n522\n00:26:58.786 --> 00:27:01.219\nIs it 129?\n\n523\n00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:04.583\nYou don't have to convert the entire\nIP address that they give you, but\n\n524\n00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:06.053\njust convert the first octet.\n\n525\n00:27:06.053 --> 00:27:07.537\nYou can convert the first octet.\n\n526\n00:27:07.537 --> 00:27:09.178\nAnd then you go, all right, so that begins\nwith a zero, that unit right there,\n\n527\n00:27:09.178 --> 00:27:09.756\nthat's a Class A address.\n\n528\n00:27:09.756 --> 00:27:12.822\nYep.\n\n529\n00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:14.491\nMakes it very simple, okay?\n\n530\n00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:16.872\nSo let's do Class B quickly here.\n\n531\n00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:21.512\nClass B address begins at 128,\n\n532\n00:27:21.512 --> 00:27:25.357\nall the way through 191.\n\n533\n00:27:25.357 --> 00:27:28.477\nSo this one follows kind of\nthat same pattern as well.\n\n534\n00:27:28.477 --> 00:27:31.167\nWith 128,\nwe'll actually see this one up here.\n\n535\n00:27:31.167 --> 00:27:35.856\nBut then with 191, it's kind of\nthe same thing right here too,\n\n536\n00:27:35.856 --> 00:27:39.639\nwhere what you actually end\nup getting is a 1 and a 0.\n\n537\n00:27:44.182 --> 00:27:45.864\nWhere this is 191.\n\n538\n00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:48.844\nSo now I notice that Class B addresses,\n\n539\n00:27:48.844 --> 00:27:53.629\nevery single one of them will\nbegin with a 1,0, in binary for\n\n540\n00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:58.804\nthe first octet, all the way up to\nthe very last one which is 191.\n\n541\n00:27:58.804 --> 00:28:01.485\nNotice 1,0, okay,?\n\n542\n00:28:01.485 --> 00:28:02.956\nSo that's also a key.\n\n543\n00:28:02.956 --> 00:28:07.148\nAnd of course, they're never gonna ask you\nabout all the ones that are right smack\n\n544\n00:28:07.148 --> 00:28:08.135\ndab in the middle.\n\n545\n00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:08.761\nYeah.\nThey will.\n\n546\n00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:10.732\nEvery once in a while, you go,\nokay, that's an easy one.\n\n547\n00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:13.027\nBut they're always on the fringe there,\nright?\n\n548\n00:28:13.027 --> 00:28:16.336\nSo let's do a Class C.\n\n549\n00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:22.448\nSo this is 192 through 223.\n\n550\n00:28:22.448 --> 00:28:27.760\nSo with 192, the great thing is\nhopefully you can see this, okay?\n\n551\n00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.920\n192, now 223.\n\n552\n00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.558\nThe way that works is also right here too.\n\n553\n00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:44.331\nNow if you'll notice that we\nactually did progression, right?\n\n554\n00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:48.148\nClass C,\nthe very first binary digit, okay?\n\n555\n00:28:48.148 --> 00:28:48.847\nWas what?\n\n556\n00:28:48.847 --> 00:28:50.707\nA 0.\n\n557\n00:28:50.707 --> 00:28:55.157\nClass B, 0, excuse me, a 1 and a 0.\n\n558\n00:28:55.157 --> 00:28:59.941\nClass C here, 110 is what you're\nactually starting to see.\n\n559\n00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:00.635\nI'm noticing a pattern.\n\n560\n00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:04.802\nYep- [LAUGH] So hopefully you\nare noticing this pattern here,\n\n561\n00:29:04.802 --> 00:29:09.020\nwhere as you continue to go forward,\nand you start to see this,\n\n562\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:15.088\nthe lowest number in a Class C address, or\nthe lowest network, begins with a 1,1,0.\n\n563\n00:29:15.088 --> 00:29:18.939\nAnd the very highest number\nbegins with a 1,1,0.\n\n564\n00:29:18.939 --> 00:29:23.731\nSo for you being able to just identify\nwhether it's a Class A, Class B, or\n\n565\n00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:28.393\na Class C address, even if you memorize\nthe table, it works very well.\n\n566\n00:29:28.393 --> 00:29:32.096\nBut remember what we told you, is that\non the exam, you can't just count that's\n\n567\n00:29:32.096 --> 00:29:34.723\nthe way that they're gonna ask\nyou which is on the table.\n\n568\n00:29:34.723 --> 00:29:36.877\nYou can count on the very\nfact that they might say,\n\n569\n00:29:36.877 --> 00:29:38.785\nwhich of the following\nis a Class B address?\n\n570\n00:29:38.785 --> 00:29:40.454\nThey just give you binary numbers.\n\n571\n00:29:40.454 --> 00:29:41.123\nYeah.\n\n572\n00:29:41.123 --> 00:29:43.229\nIt's very possible that can happen.\n\n573\n00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:46.805\nAnd the same thing, so\nyou have to know both ways.\n\n574\n00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:50.342\nIf you can memorize these concepts\nthat we've just talked about, right?\n\n575\n00:29:50.342 --> 00:29:53.938\nBeing able to convert a binary number\nto a decimal, a decimal to a binary.\n\n576\n00:29:53.938 --> 00:29:57.034\nUse this table,\nit's the easiest one that's out, okay?\n\n577\n00:29:57.034 --> 00:30:00.443\nAnd that'll actually help you out\nto make sure that this gets done.\n\n578\n00:30:00.443 --> 00:30:04.736\nYou can pretty much conquer just about\nevery question that they ask you if it has\n\n579\n00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.505\nto do with binary at all, okay?\n\n580\n00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:12.691\nSo do this, keep practicing, go through\nevery single digit from 0 through 255.\n\n581\n00:30:12.691 --> 00:30:16.534\nStart doing that automatically, and\nget as quick as you can doing that, so\n\n582\n00:30:16.534 --> 00:30:19.218\nit doesn't throw you when\nyou see 8 bits of binary.\n\n583\n00:30:19.218 --> 00:30:23.219\nOr when you see a decimal number, and\nyou go, I can convert that, okay?\n\n584\n00:30:23.219 --> 00:30:23.856\nThat's what you want.\n\n585\n00:30:23.856 --> 00:30:27.689\nYou want that type of confidence that\nif you see that, it doesn't matter.\n\n586\n00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:30.325\nEven if you have to\nslow down just briefly,\n\n587\n00:30:30.325 --> 00:30:35.456\nyou can make this chart right here on that\nsheet of dry erase paper that you'll get,\n\n588\n00:30:35.456 --> 00:30:37.454\nand then if you need to, right?\n\n589\n00:30:37.454 --> 00:30:41.029\nIn other words, if you're kind of like,\nI'm kind of on the edge about this,\n\n590\n00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:43.290\nthen you can mark it down and\njust simply do that.\n\n591\n00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.005\nBut don't expect to take time doing this.\n\n592\n00:30:46.005 --> 00:30:50.092\nThe time that you have is now\nwhile you're studying on the exam,\n\n593\n00:30:50.092 --> 00:30:52.974\nyou will not have time\nto do the conversions.\n\n594\n00:30:52.974 --> 00:30:54.821\nSo if you need to slow down, you can.\n\n595\n00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:57.041\nBut that means you gotta\npick up time somewhere else.\n\n596\n00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:58.291\nSo just be aware.\n\n597\n00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:04.020\nSo Daniel, that will kind of set the basis\nfor all this stuff that we have to do.\n\n598\n00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.020\nNow we still actually have another\npart where we have to talk about\n\n599\n00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.229\nthe application of this.\n\n600\n00:31:08.229 --> 00:31:10.988\nHm.\nAnd also the other part of the limitation\n\n601\n00:31:10.988 --> 00:31:13.724\nof the IPv4 pool, and\nhow we've dealt with it.\n\n602\n00:31:13.724 --> 00:31:17.964\nSo Daniel, it looks like we're gonna be\ngoing into another part for this show.\n\n603\n00:31:17.964 --> 00:31:19.312\nWell we gotta do what we gotta do,\nright Ronnie?\n\n604\n00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:23.862\nGotta make sure the good folks out there\nwatching have the information necessary so\n\n605\n00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:25.422\nthey can conquer that exam.\n\n606\n00:31:25.422 --> 00:31:26.090\nRonnie, thanks for\n\n607\n00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.462\ngetting us this far, we look forward\nto seeing you in the next episode.\n\n608\n00:31:28.462 --> 00:31:30.041\nHey, we look forward to\nseeing you there as well.\n\n609\n00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:33.117\nBut as the man has eluded to,\nwe are out of time for this one.\n\n610\n00:31:33.117 --> 00:31:34.129\nSo we're gonna sign off.\n\n611\n00:31:34.129 --> 00:31:36.410\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.252\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n613\n00:31:37.252 --> 00:31:38.093\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n614\n00:31:38.093 -->

They also describe some of the methods used to deal with the limitation of the IPv4 address pool: NAT, VLSM and IPv6.  Lastly, they show how IPv4 addresses are applied to routers and switches.",

00:00:08.082\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:12.860\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.170\nGreetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.440\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.530\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more of our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.540\nAnd I know you guys have been enjoying\nit so far, I sure have as well.\n\n9\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.830\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto continue with the revelries,\n\n10\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.300\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.380\nRonnie, welcome back man, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.550\nhaving me back as we continue\non our binary journey here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.340\nI've taken a look at several of\nthe different things that we have to learn\n\n14\n00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.270\nabout, especially when preparing for\nthe CCENT exam as well.\n\n15\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.780\nNow, the binary part is a big, critical\npart and nature of what you have to learn.\n\n16\n00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.460\nMost people are gonna find a little\nbit of a struggle to it, but\n\n17\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.030\nwe showed you in the last\nepisode how to work with that.\n\n18\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.170\nThis episode we're gonna take a look\nat some application that at least I\n\n19\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.370\nhope we're gonna get through everything in\nthis episode where we take a look at where\n\n20\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.280\nwe can apply these dresses\ntoo as well as talk about\n\n21\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.134\na few special revelations that we have\nto realize that binary To start with and\n\n22\n00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:11.020\nthen talk about some special address too.\n\n23\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.090\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\nget started as we take a look here.\n\n24\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.500\nLet's go back down to my sheet.\n\n25\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080\nAnd I've written it down here.\n\n26\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.940\nThe very fact is there are some\nbinary revelations and\n\n27\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.390\nsome special addresses that we do need\nto know so let's start with this idea.\n\n28\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.280\nI went ahead and typed out\nthe first one because I know that I\n\n29\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280\nforget stuff if I don't type it out right.\n\n30\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.130\nSo the first one is binary, not only\ndid it help us to reveal the different\n\n31\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.870\nclasses and the addresses as well as help\nus with the different conversions and\n\n32\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.600\nwhat we'll see on the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.630\nBut binary is very important because\nit helps us to easily reveal something\n\n34\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.980\nabout our networks, and that is part\nof that idea that 32 bit address,\n\n35\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.730\nthat there is a network ID, and then of\ncourse there's a host ID that we have for\n\n36\n00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.670\none individual device, but there's also\nsome special addresses here too, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.583\nThe network ID and\nthe broadcast ID is also important.\n\n38\n00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:10.767\nThese particular addresses are not\n\n39\n00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:17.780\nassigned to any one device on a network.\n\n40\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.140\nThe first one hopefully and the name ID.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n41\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.410\n&gt;&gt; The first one is just\n\n42\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.630\nan identifier, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.270\nSo for example here,\n\n44\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.920\nthe network identifier that is a number in\nwhich we say, hey, here's the network or\n\n45\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.410\nlogical grouping that these computers and\nthese devices belong to.\n\n46\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.150\nSo we do not get to use that\nto be able to send data to.\n\n47\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.240\nWe tend to use it just to\nidentify that network.\n\n48\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.330\n&gt;&gt; It's not an assignable IP address.\n\n49\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, it is not an assignable\n\n50\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.960\nIP address.\n\n51\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.920\nAnd the problem that we're gonna have\nlater on as we get into it, as we'll see,\n\n52\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.900\nwe'll break this rule that we've been\ntalking about, of class full of dressing.\n\n53\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.170\nAnd that's when the numbers\nget a little bit tricky,\n\n54\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.090\nand that's why you want to know this.\n\n55\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.700\nBut I want to go ahead and\njust put the key here.\n\n56\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.840\nAs we talk about breaking the rules,\nwe'll get into the details of this.\n\n57\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.670\nBut right now, for\nbeing able to identify this.\n\n58\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.170\nThis is when,\nin the network ID of the IP address.\n\n59\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.080\nLet me do it this way.\n\n60\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.066\nThe HOST bits.\n\n61\n00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:27.780\nHOST, why can't I spell\nwhat I want to spell here?\n\n62\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.958\nHOST bits, it's just me,\nthe HOST bits are all\n\n63\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:36.640\nbinary zeros, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.260\nSo when you take a look in the address and\nyou identify the network portion,\n\n65\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.000\nwhich we are going to get to in\nanother episode at some point here.\n\n66\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.060\nBut when we start to do this, right?\n\n67\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.580\nYou're gonna realized that there's a\ncertain number of bytes that's assigned to\n\n68\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.790\nthe network.\n\n69\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.610\nAnd once you actually identify that,\n\n70\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.560\nyou identify the actual network ID itself\nby looking at the host portion of it.\n\n71\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.930\nIn other words, the portion\nthat's not the network bytes and\n\n72\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.390\nthose are all gonna be binary zeros, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.160\nSo it doesn't matter how many there are\njust remember that because that's gonna be\n\n74\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.060\nkey to you being able to identify whether\nor not that's actually a network ID, or\n\n75\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.910\nis this just another host on the network,\nall right?\n\n76\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.050\nNow, the other one is the broadcast.\n\n77\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.060\nNow, we had talked about\na broadcast at the very beginning,\n\n78\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.750\ninside of our episode one of\nthis little miniseries here.\n\n79\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.566\nBroadcast ID this one is also\nidentifiable the HOST bits\n\n80\n00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:37.540\nare all binary ones.\n\n81\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.540\nSo that's how you can identify that,\nas well.\n\n82\n00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.680\nSo as you actually figure\nout what the network ID is,\n\n83\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.540\nthe broadcast is like what Daniel said.\n\n84\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.420\nIt's not an assignable address,\nI can't put this on Daniel's computer and\n\n85\n00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.660\nexpect his computer to work.\n\n86\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.280\nThe broadcast address is that\none-to-all address where I can\n\n87\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.540\nsend out a broadcast and it goes out\nto every single device on my network.\n\n88\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.780\nEvery single network has a network ID and\nhas a broadcast ID that is natively done,\n\n89\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.710\njust the way that the binary is\nactually set up for us to do that.\n\n90\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.890\nThat's how they decide\nto do it in networking.\n\n91\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.800\nSo normally it's the first number in that\nnetwork, and then essentially the last\n\n92\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.050\nnumber in that network is what\nwe are talking about, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.220\nIn between that of course,\n\n94\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.420\nwould be the ranges of IP addresses\nthat we can now use to help us out.\n\n95\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.470\nSo right here there is just\nthat type of revelation.\n\n96\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.690\nNow when we get into\nthis a little bit more.\n\n97\n00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.360\nJust as a side note, which we'll get into\nwhen we get into subnetting here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.250\nIs that, we identify that\nnetwork id by using a process,\n\n99\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.610\nwhich is another binary math process here.\n\n100\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.470\nBut binary ending, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.550\nSo, go figure which is why\nyou should take a look into\n\n102\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.240\ndoing some mathematical\nprocess with the subnet mask.\n\n103\n00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.290\nWhich we've talked about\nbriefly that helps us to say,\n\n104\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.160\nhey, here's the bits that are associated\nwith the network ID and we'll do that, but\n\n105\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160\nthen you'll actually see what error's\nleft over if those are all zeroes\n\n106\n00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.400\nthen we know that that's the network ID.\n\n107\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.480\nOkay, and then if you actually take\na look here at the broadcast ID,\n\n108\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.290\nit's the one with all ones here.\n\n109\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.490\nSo you gotta be careful.\n\n110\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.570\nSo once you actually identify that and\nthen you take a look at the real number\n\n111\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.360\nthat what we will actually\nbe doing as well.\n\n112\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.280\nBut we won't get into that right now.\n\n113\n00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.420\nSo that is kinda one of the special\nrevelations that you have to be\n\n114\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.530\nsure that you pay attention to, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.230\nBut once we have that, where we can\nidentify both of these, the next thing\n\n116\n00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.080\nthat we also have to do is we have to\ncome back around to 32 bit pool again.\n\n117\n00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.920\nAnd I mention it now at least in every\nepisode so far, is that it was a limited\n\n118\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.940\npool of addresses,\nwhere we have quickly depleted them.\n\n119\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.960\nAnd we showed you they started depleting\nfaster once they started assigning\n\n120\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.190\nThose addresses and\nthose classes to, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.500\nThe other thing that started to happen is\nthat they realized that they were behind\n\n122\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.160\nthe eight ball, and that they were\nnot ready for this depletion.\n\n123\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.210\nSince they were not ready for\nthis depletion,\n\n124\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.460\nthey started to have to come up with\ndifferent kinda stopgap measures, and\n\n125\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.320\nthen also come up with a solution\nto how they could prepare for\n\n126\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.260\nthe onslaught of the request of IP\naddresses that they just didn't have.\n\n127\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.610\nSo that's what we need\nto talk about as well.\n\n128\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.450\nSo we'll get back to these special\naddresses here in just a moment, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.350\nSo one of the things that\nstarted to happen, so\n\n130\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.770\nthere were several or\nthree I guess, really.\n\n131\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.265\nThree or four,\ndepends on how you look at it, three or\n\n132\n00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:30.930\nfour different technologies,\nor different methods.\n\n133\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.520\nDifferent methods to address\n\n134\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.880\nthe shortage of IP addresses, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.810\nSo the first one here,\nthat started to happen I shouldn't say.\n\n136\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.250\nIt's not actually a matter of importance,\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.860\nIt is that there was an RFC\ncalled RFC 1918, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.899\nRFC 1918.\nNow that's an easy one for me to remember,\n\n139\n00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:58.934\nI don't know why.\n\n140\n00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:03.330\nBut that just seems like a natural\nnumber that comes off of my head here,\n\n141\n00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.147\nas I do this.\n\n142\n00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:05.966\nBut let's take a look at\nthat range of addresses.\n\n143\n00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:09.464\nThose are what we call\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n144\n00:08:09.464 --> 00:08:15.170\nNow these IP addresses are not\ngoing to be valid on the internet.\n\n145\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.910\nAs you assign them inside of your network,\n\n146\n00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.680\nIt cannot go past your\nown edge of your network.\n\n147\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.205\nSilly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:27.310\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to say the edge of your\n\n149\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.140\nrouter, but that doesn't make sense.\n\n150\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.030\nSo the edge of your network.\n\n151\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.370\nSo wherever your router is,\nit can't go past that.\n\n152\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.660\nNow what happens with a private IP\naddress, if it gets out on the internet?\n\n153\n00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.690\nIt's not supposed to,\nyour ISPs are supposed to block that out.\n\n154\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.660\nSo they automatically have filter rules,\n\n155\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.260\nat least as far as I\nknow they're suppose to.\n\n156\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.010\nBecause if not they get in\ntrouble really really bad.\n\n157\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.826\nSo here it is, you want to make sure\nthat you know these ranges too.\n\n158\n00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:54.030\nThey actually made it had\na different range for\n\n159\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.360\neach one of these \\Class A,\nClass B and Class C address.\n\n160\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.040\nNow, Daniel, let\n\n161\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.610\nme ask you a question here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n162\n00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.050\n&gt;&gt; So now that we know that there was\n\n163\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.730\na limitation on the 4 billion plus\naddresses that were depleting rapidly.\n\n164\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.460\nThey go ahead and they do this and\n\n165\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.664\nthey eliminate what?\n&gt;&gt; They carved out a bunch of [CROSSTALK].\n\n166\n00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:12.630\nYou can't even use that.\n&gt;&gt; And they made it even smaller.\n\n167\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.860\nSo Daniel that doesn't\nseem like [INAUDIBLE].\n\n168\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.900\n&gt;&gt; Counterintuitive, yeah.\n\n169\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.230\nWe're having a real problem\nwith not enough addresses.\n\n170\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.980\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna chunk out a bunch of them.\n\n171\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.550\nAnd that you can't use on the internet.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.730\nIt doesn't make sense in the way that\nthey seem to have tactically gone.\n\n173\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.880\nWait a minute, that's not how\nyou kind of relieve pressure,\n\n174\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.490\nby taking away more.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what they did,\n\n175\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.170\nthey took away the entire\nten networking class a.\n\n176\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.720\nSo remember that a Class A, right?\n\n177\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.820\nDefault, only the first\neight bits of the network,\n\n178\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.520\nthat means 16,770,214 possible addresses.\n\n179\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.350\nThey're like, wiped out,\ndone, that's it, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:55.240\nAnd then in Class B, another 65,000,\nactually a little less than that.\n\n181\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.590\nIt's about 48,000 altogether here because\nactually, I have the wrong, Jiminy.\n\n182\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.150\nI can't even do that anymore,\nthat is my fault all together.\n\n183\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.380\nSo it's 20 bits so whatever that is.\n\n184\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.160\nAnd this one is actually gonna be a.\n\n185\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.260\nSee, my typing is just terrible.\n\n186\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.095\nSo that actually carved\na chunk out here in Class B.\n\n187\n00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:19.730\n172.16, okay,\nmake sure you remember those numbers.\n\n188\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.960\nAll the way through 1, 7, 2, 31.\n\n189\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.210\nSo that's not even\nan entire class b address.\n\n190\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.522\nBut it's still several thousand, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:31.150\n30,000, 40,000 addresses that you\nhave to worry about there, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.280\nClass c, they made it a complete\nClass B range just what they did.\n\n193\n00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.460\nSo about 65,000 plus so\nthis one's a little bit more 520 or\n\n194\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.160\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n195\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.550\n&gt;&gt; Is what ends up happening.\n\n196\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.360\nSo yeah she end up seeing that\nthere's a lot that they've done.\n\n197\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.070\nWhere they've just kind\nof eliminated these.\n\n198\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.240\nNow the reason that they\ndid is that they say look,\n\n199\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.630\nthese are not gonna be\nvalid on the internet.\n\n200\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.320\nBut Daniel if you want to,\n\n201\n00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.080\nyou can use these particular\naddresses internally on your network.\n\n202\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.210\nSo it was used in combination with\nanother technology to help us out.\n\n203\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:09.460\nNow the original technology didn't really\nhelp us out as much as we wanted to.\n\n204\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.520\nAnd the very fact that we've\nnow had two systems, right?\n\n205\n00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.530\nWe had one that we could use internally\nin our LANS the way that we wanted to.\n\n206\n00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.160\nWe could use as many\naddresses as we wanted to.\n\n207\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.250\nBut when you went out\nto the internet though,\n\n208\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.240\nit ended up getting translated\ninto public IP addresses.\n\n209\n00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.450\nSo let's take for instance that Daniel\ndidn't get the entirety of a class C.\n\n210\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.540\nBut his CEO or\n\n211\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:40.090\nhis Chief Technology Officers Daniel\nwe're gonna give you three IP addresses.\n\n212\n00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.240\nNow that translation,\n\n213\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.980\nthe original one was a one to ne\ntranslation that didn't really helped.\n\n214\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.440\nThat meant that if you had\nprivate IP addresses here.\n\n215\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.150\nAnd let's say that Daniel actually\nassigned this entire class\n\n216\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.620\nc which is 254 addresses.\n\n217\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.210\nThey only had three IP addresses.\n\n218\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.310\nThat meant that anything\nafter these three,\n\n219\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.710\nthey would have to wait\nuntil these three were done.\n\n220\n00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:02.040\nSo they could share them but\nnot at the same time.\n\n221\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.910\nSo if computer ten dropped off,\nthen 13 could come on.\n\n222\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.420\nIf computer 11 dropped off, 14 could\ncome on but they couldn't come back in.\n\n223\n00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.270\nSo they had to kind of rotate around.\n\n224\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.410\nAnd they had a limited number of addresses\nthat they wanted to be able to do.\n\n225\n00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.990\nNow, there's another technology\nthat we will talk about later on,\n\n226\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.590\nwhere they said look, that's ridiculous.\n\n227\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.460\nWe want to be able to\noverload these addresses.\n\n228\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.110\nWe want to be able to take\none public IP address.\n\n229\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.100\nAnd put all the addresses that we want\nto and there is a limitation to it.\n\n230\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.830\nBut in theory,\nthat actually also tied to port numbers.\n\n231\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.130\nSo don't worry about that right now.\n\n232\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.740\nBut what that means is that it could\nactually overload it with 1,000 internal\n\n233\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.740\nprivate IP addresses to a single\npublic IP address as the key.\n\n234\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.090\nSo using what we call\nnetwork address translation.\n\n235\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.460\nThey actually have a device usually,\nit's the router that you configure.\n\n236\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.410\nAnd in the CCNA studies,\nyou will be configuring that on a router.\n\n237\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.850\nTo make sure that it works.\n\n238\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.750\nAnd you translate private\nIP addresses into\n\n239\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.260\nthe public IP addresses\nthat are available.\n\n240\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.990\nOr into one public IP address.\n\n241\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.620\nAnd that is by far the most popular\nusage of what we tend to see.\n\n242\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.450\nSo, the combination of a couple of\nthings really did help slow down.\n\n243\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:18.660\nThis is by far the biggest things\nthat helps slow down the depletion.\n\n244\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.360\nBecause now a companies didn't\nhave to have 254 addresses.\n\n245\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.565\nAnd have to have 16 million\npublic IP addresses or\n\n246\n00:13:26.565 --> 00:13:28.990\neven 16,000 public IP addresses.\n\n247\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.850\nOkay then have to have any of that.\n\n248\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.570\nThey could actually have just a few,\n\n249\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.000\nthat would serve the needs\nthat they needed here.\n\n250\n00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.620\nAnd then they could use network address\ntranslation to translate thousands and\n\n251\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.980\nactually make that happen.\n\n252\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.890\nNow, out on the internet that looks\nlike one machine that's just going nuts.\n\n253\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.690\nBut overall though, it did work,\nand it's still in work today.\n\n254\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.110\nIt does break a few things.\n\n255\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.600\nSo it's not the best thing in the world,\nbut it does work.\n\n256\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.630\nAnd today we've now been using it for so\n\n257\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.130\nlong, it seems like just\nthe natural way to do things.\n\n258\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.240\nBut this is a stop gap measure,\nso private IP addresses.\n\n259\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.520\nAnother stop gap measure, say, you've got\nthousands of computers on the inside.\n\n260\n00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.130\nYou don't need public IP address,\nuses these.\n\n261\n00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.120\nUse NAP to help you to translate.\n\n262\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.500\nThe other thing they also started doing,\n\n263\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.270\nis they started breaking\nthe rules on the Internet, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.250\nAnd the way that they did that is what\nwe call variable link subnet masking.\n\n265\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.050\nNow I used a private IP address\nrange to try and show you.\n\n266\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.100\nWe are going to get into\nthis a little bit later,\n\n267\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.950\nit may even be in\nthe CCNA studies instead.\n\n268\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.120\nBut what they allowed you to which is what\nwe're gonna get in to in another episode.\n\n269\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.140\nHere is they created\nsomething that they called.\n\n270\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.900\nWhich is breaking the rules.\n\n271\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.990\nSo let's not follow those\nclassful addresses anymore.\n\n272\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.660\nNow let's break the rules and\n\n273\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.280\nnow you can actually create networks\nthat actually fit what you need.\n\n274\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.040\nInstead of networks that fit what\nthe classes said that you needed.\n\n275\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.120\nSo for example, let's say that we\nhave a network like this, right?\n\n276\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.570\nAnd Daniel, you only have ten\nhosts on this one network.\n\n277\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.240\nWell, you can come as close as\nyou can to being able to do this.\n\n278\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.250\nI actually have this one\nas being wrong here.\n\n279\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.790\nI just spotted that,that's supposed\nto be a 28,it's all right,okay.\n\n280\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.895\nAnd those numbers in\nthat notation here,okay.\n\n281\n00:15:10.895 --> 00:15:15.690\nWhat they actually mean is that\nthere is amended number of addresses\n\n282\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.240\nthat we can do.\n\n283\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.170\nAnd we actually see that and\n\n284\n00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.230\nnotice this number here with a slash\nnotation a little bit different.\n\n285\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.640\nAnd this one down here.\n\n286\n00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.610\nAnd that is because they\nchanged it to make it easier.\n\n287\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.040\nSo that the subnet mask is\nno longer 255.255.255.0.\n\n288\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.140\nAnd it's just reporting it\nstill exactly like that, but\n\n289\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.150\nto report it out that you'd\nactually made a change.\n\n290\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.650\nNotice you can change these and\nwe can actually use different ones.\n\n291\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:45.440\nSo your ISPs can do this, where they only\nassign you a chunk of a class A address.\n\n292\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.960\nOr a chunk of a class B address or\nwhether it might be.\n\n293\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.390\nAnd then internally, you can take\nwhatever size that you want and\n\n294\n00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.020\nthen change that around.\n\n295\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.484\nSo I'm using private IP address.\n\n296\n00:15:57.484 --> 00:16:00.997\nIt's because if I try and make that one\nas public, it's somebody's IP address.\n\n297\n00:16:00.997 --> 00:16:03.391\nSo I don't wanna do that\nis what I don't want to do.\n\n298\n00:16:03.391 --> 00:16:07.580\nSo here, let's say that our\nISP assigned us this, right?\n\n299\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.968\nSo, there it is, Daniel.\n\n300\n00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:12.201\nYou've got to sign that entire\nclass C address which means really\n\n301\n00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:13.213\nin reality, what?\n\n302\n00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:18.825\nOne network you have 254 possible IP\naddresses that you can assign but\n\n303\n00:16:18.825 --> 00:16:23.450\nout of that network I can\nsubdivide that network up.\n\n304\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.150\nAnd create three point-to-point\nlinks right between here and here.\n\n305\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.600\nAnd these are actually individual\nseparate networks that are here.\n\n306\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.740\nAnd then create actually three other\nadditional networks and possibly more.\n\n307\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.340\nThe key here is when you add\nup all the number of hosts,\n\n308\n00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.700\nthey never equal up to this, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.120\nIf you get it and\nyou start adding it up, and\n\n310\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.620\nyou go, I have 512 possible\nIP addresses that I'm using.\n\n311\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.490\nI'm gonna call shenanigans on you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.130\n&gt;&gt; That that's not possible.\n\n313\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.910\nSo that's what you wanna keep track of.\n\n314\n00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.850\nIs that if you add up all these\nnumbers that they're smaller than\n\n315\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.810\nthe network that you assigned,\nthen you're okay.\n\n316\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.570\nSo variable length subnetmasking,\n\n317\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.870\nNAT, private IP addresses,\nessentially are stopgaps.\n\n318\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:09.180\nAnd that depletion of the pool of\naddresses that we've been talking about.\n\n319\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.230\nAnd that's important because that's\nkind of the mainstay of how networks\n\n320\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.140\nend up working today, is that we are using\nthe combination of all these measures\n\n321\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.020\nto still stay connected on the Internet.\n\n322\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.820\nSo it really is kinda neat in\nthe technology that we see here.\n\n323\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.990\nNow, that actually leads\nus to something else,\n\n324\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.730\nwhich we'll dive deeper into later on.\n\n325\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.720\nBut just as an introduction,\n\n326\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.730\nwe're not talking about a solution, right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n327\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.420\n&gt;&gt; So we talked about stop gaps at this\n\n328\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.740\npoint, private IP addresses, VLSM,\nvariable length subnet masking,\n\n329\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.980\nall well as NAP.\n\n330\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.220\nThose are really all,\n\n331\n00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.000\nthey were at the beginning, temporary\nsolutions until we find a solution here.\n\n332\n00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.230\nThe solution is what we call IP version 6,\nokay.\n\n333\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:51.470\nNow IP version 6, even though there's tons\nof different attributes which you can\n\n334\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.120\nlook up on the Internet and we're gonna\ngo over some of them when we get into\n\n335\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.420\nthe section specifically\non IP version 6 here.\n\n336\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.130\nBut the pool of valid addresses right?\n\n337\n00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.470\nIn IP version 4, it was bout 4.3 billion\nor somewhere around there right?\n\n338\n00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.860\nWell now that pool changes to this number.\n\n339\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.251\nJust a little bit larger.\n&gt;&gt; That's a number?\n\n340\n00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:10.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a number.\n\n341\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.630\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was\n\n342\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.790\na series of numbers, man.\n\n343\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.310\nThat's a big old number.\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n344\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.970\nThat is one big gigantic number,\n\n345\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.390\nthat even the analogies used to describe\nthis number, they don't make sense.\n\n346\n00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.530\nThe analogies don't make sense.\n\n347\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.640\nSo I've heard several of them.\n\n348\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.420\nOne of the ones that I heard is like,\nif you were to take a, 53 foot trailer,\n\n349\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.690\nright, that goes on the back of a tractor\ntrailer, if you were to fill it with sand.\n\n350\n00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.880\nYou could actually assign IP addresses\nto every single grain of sand in there,\n\n351\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.150\nyou wouldn't run out of addresses.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n352\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.470\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.380\nThe other one is actually even\nmore startling, nanites, right?\n\n354\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.740\nThese are robots the size of human cells.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n355\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.750\nIf you were to actually\ncreate that many nanites,\n\n356\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.390\nit would equal 40%, or\nI may be wrong, maybe 60.\n\n357\n00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.290\nI think it's 40% of the volume of\nthe Earth, that's how heavy it would be.\n\n358\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.710\nThat doesn't make sense\nto me when you thinking.\n\n359\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.360\nSo that's just a couple of them and you'll\nprobably find millions other analogies\n\n360\n00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.340\nwhere you're like, that number doesn't\neven come close to making sense\n\n361\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.260\nas reading one a little\nbit earlier this morning.\n\n362\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.790\nIt's like, 1.6 times or\n\n363\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.610\nit's something like 10 to 124th power or\nsomething like that.\n\n364\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.380\nIt's just, if you assign that many\naddresses to a square meter on the planet,\n\n365\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.380\nevery square meter on the planet,\n\n366\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.500\nyou still have millions if not\nbillions of addresses left over.\n\n367\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.165\nSo I'm saying now, for you and me,\nwhat numbers do make sense, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:32.165 --> 00:19:35.950\nThis address right here, and the way\nthat it breaks down for one network.\n\n369\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.632\nIf I were to assign Daniel one\npublic IP version 6 address,\n\n370\n00:19:40.632 --> 00:19:45.035\nhe would have more possible\nIP addresses than the entire\n\n371\n00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:48.700\npopulation of the Internet right now,\nokay?\n\n372\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.237\nSo in over 4.3 billion and\nhe would actually laugh if you go,\n\n373\n00:19:52.237 --> 00:19:53.250\nI need a billion.\n\n374\n00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.390\nHe'd go here, have a billion.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.260\n&gt;&gt; And it wouldn't matter.\n\n376\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:56.960\n&gt;&gt; Have some for your kids.\n\n377\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n378\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.890\n&gt;&gt; Buy them something nice.\n\n379\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I mean, that's how big it is.\n\n380\n00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.680\nSo right now, every individual then on\nthis that actually has an IP address could\n\n381\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.440\nend up with more than the current pool\nof IP addresses on the Internet, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.230\n&gt;&gt; That's impressive.\n\n383\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.896\n&gt;&gt; That's how big it is,\n\n384\n00:20:11.896 --> 00:20:13.550\nit's gigantic and it's impressive here.\n\n385\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.800\nNow it's still binary at its heart, okay?\n\n386\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.990\nBut it's not binary in the same way,\nright?\n\n387\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.590\nIt's not 32 bits of binary,\n\n388\n00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.250\nwhich is normally reported\nin dotted decimal notation.\n\n389\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.460\nIf they were to do that,\n\n390\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:31.900\nit would be 16 octets is what you would\nsee instead of 4 octets, so 16 octets.\n\n391\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.780\nInstead what they do is they actually\nreport it in hexadecimal numbers.\n\n392\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:42.950\nAnd here's an example of what an IP\naddress in IP version 6 could look like.\n\n393\n00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.020\nAnd now these have actually undergone\nchanges over a while here, but\n\n394\n00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.240\nthat's what you're actually talking about.\n\n395\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.770\nSo those are kind of solutions then\nwe'll get much deeper in the IPv6 in\n\n396\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.620\nthe series, as well.\n\n397\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.120\nAll right, so now that we have the context\nof why this is actually important,\n\n398\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.400\nwe now need to talk about\nthe application of these things.\n\n399\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.810\nEven though the concepts by themselves\nreally don't tend to affect us to much,\n\n400\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.340\nthe application of them will.\n\n401\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.790\nSo that is what we want to\nbe able to go to next here.\n\n402\n00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.940\nNow, I want to show you\njust a couple of examples,\n\n403\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.110\nbecause up in this point we've\njust been talking about them.\n\n404\n00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.100\nBut where do we assign\nthese types of addresses?\n\n405\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Right, what's the practical way this\n\n406\n00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.480\nworks out in reality?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n407\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.900\nSo as we do that I am going to switch over\nto our labs here to try and help us out.\n\n408\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.030\nNow when we do this,\nlet me see if I can turn off some of these\n\n409\n00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.730\nnotifications that keep\npopping up on my screen here.\n\n410\n00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.790\nI am gonna use practice labs.\n\n411\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.750\nNow these are labs that\nyou have access to.\n\n412\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.960\nThat you can end up using and\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n413\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.080\nAnd I simply opened up the lab and\nwe'll do this as we go along here,\n\n414\n00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.860\nopened up a lab, so\nthat we can do an example, as well.\n\n415\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:58.440\nAnd they have a complete set of labs for\nthe 100-105 CCENT series, as well.\n\n416\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.920\nBut I'm not going to follow\nthe actual labs steps at this point,\n\n417\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.060\nwhich we will get to in another one.\n\n418\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.620\nBut it's just to show you where IP\naddresses end up getting assigned.\n\n419\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:12.159\nWhen we start talking about at least for\nwhat we do, the majority of and\n\n420\n00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:15.800\ncset that's gonna be working\nwith routers and switches, okay?\n\n421\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.090\nWell when we actually do\nwork with a router, okay?\n\n422\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.370\nYou want to make sure that you understand\nthat given whatever IP address that\n\n423\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:27.360\nyou're given, you're going to be assigning\nthem on a per-interface basis, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.190\nAnd that means you actually will go to\nthat interface and you'll assign them.\n\n425\n00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.120\nSo my router is one that's called NYEDGE1.\n\n426\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.190\nAnd then on this router,\nnow that I'm actually here,\n\n427\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:45.660\nI'm going to type in configure terminal,\nif I can spell terminal.\n\n428\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.663\nAnd oops, let me get back down there.\n\n429\n00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:58.265\nLet's try it again.\n\n430\n00:22:58.265 --> 00:23:01.315\n[LAUGH] Maybe.\n\n431\n00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:01.815\nConfigure terminal.\n\n432\n00:23:10.517 --> 00:23:14.250\nThere we go, sorry.\n\n433\n00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.790\nI was like maybe it's not all right.\n\n434\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.700\nOkay, let me do enable to get access in.\n\n435\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.100\nAnd then I can type in configure terminal.\n\n436\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.060\nI thought I had already done\nthat earlier but I did not.\n\n437\n00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.440\nThis will get me into what's\ncalled global configuration mode.\n\n438\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.260\nWe still have to get to that part here.\n\n439\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.910\nBut then we have to find an interface.\n\n440\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.620\nSo at this point,\nlet's see what interfaces that there are.\n\n441\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:42.330\nSo let me do a show ip interface brief,\njust as an example here.\n\n442\n00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.890\nSo we're gonna just take this gigabit 0/0\nhere, this is what we're going to do.\n\n443\n00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.392\nI go back to configure, terminal and\n\n444\n00:23:51.392 --> 00:23:54.594\nthen I type in interface,\n\n445\n00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:04.409\nGigabit Ethernet 0/0.\n\n446\n00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:07.520\nAnd it's not case sensitive.\n\n447\n00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.472\nIt should find it.\n\n448\n00:24:08.472 --> 00:24:10.044\nAnd it's right here,\n\n449\n00:24:10.044 --> 00:24:15.100\nI can type in IP address then 192\n168 0.1 and it's subnet mask.\n\n450\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:22.880\nAnd once I do that, I type in a no\nshut down to turn the interface on.\n\n451\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.060\nThen I'm gonna type in exit, so\nI'm gonna try and type in exit.\n\n452\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:33.181\nThen I do a show IP interface brief.\n\n453\n00:24:35.608 --> 00:24:39.830\nAnd there you can see, I actually\nassigned an IP address to it, okay.\n\n454\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.560\nSo you'll end up assigning this on\na router, usually a per interface basis.\n\n455\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.450\nThe limitation on the router is simple.\n\n456\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.210\nNotice that there are other\ninterfaces here also Daniel.\n\n457\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.820\nThey cannot be in the same\nnetwork as this one.\n\n458\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.790\nThe way that the router works,\n\n459\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.230\neach interface essentially\nrepresents a different network.\n\n460\n00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.270\nIf you type in one in the same network,\nit's gonna say nah, you can't do it.\n\n461\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.640\nIt's not gonna allow you to do so.\n\n462\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.520\nSo that's what it will actually do for\nyou.\n\n463\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.850\nAnd there's even other\ninterfaces down here as well,\n\n464\n00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.730\nbut you can assign IP addresses\nto these interfaces very easily.\n\n465\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.890\nNow on a switch thought and\nthis is another way here, okay?\n\n466\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.500\nA switch is different.\n\n467\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:22.150\nA switch doesn't actually allow you to\nassign IP addresses to an interface.\n\n468\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.640\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n469\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.524\nLet me go to configure terminal and\n\n470\n00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:31.600\nthen let's do an interface,\nI see that I actually have one.\n\n471\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.640\nLet's see there's probably 0.1.\n\n472\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.466\nSo interface, gig,\n\n473\n00:25:38.466 --> 00:25:41.414\nyou got bit,\n\n474\n00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:46.250\nethernet, 0/1.\n\n475\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.519\nThere we go.\n\n476\n00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.960\nSo that interface.\n\n477\n00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.125\nNow I am going to type\nin an IP address here.\n\n478\n00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:55.781\nIP address 192 168 10.1.\n\n479\n00:25:55.781 --> 00:26:02.140\nOops, I forgot the subnet mask,\nso we can do it complete here.\n\n480\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.913\n192.168.0.1.\n\n481\n00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:09.560\nNotice it says, hey,\nyou're having an error, right?\n\n482\n00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.660\nIt says invalid input.\n\n483\n00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.070\nAnd that's because you can't do this.\n\n484\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.930\nNormally switches do not allow\nyou to put an IP address on them.\n\n485\n00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.350\nThere's ways you can do that,\n\n486\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.620\nbut for us, it's not normally\ngoing to be where you do this.\n\n487\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.056\nSo it's different because in a router,\nthe IP address are set there so\n\n488\n00:26:25.056 --> 00:26:27.170\nthat you can route information.\n\n489\n00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.260\nOn switches,\nyou aren't routing information.\n\n490\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.200\nSo IP addresses on switches\nare actually for identification and\n\n491\n00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.850\nthis is where you have to put\nit on a virtual interface.\n\n492\n00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.205\nOn this one, let me exit here.\n\n493\n00:26:39.205 --> 00:26:42.210\nAnd then let me do interface, VLAN 1.\n\n494\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.170\nThat's the default virtual interface.\n\n495\n00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.480\nThat's on the switch by default.\n\n496\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:55.904\nThis will help you out, because this\nis where I can now assign, 1921680.2.\n\n497\n00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.624\nI forgot the IP address, see?\n\n498\n00:26:58.624 --> 00:27:07.840\nSo, 0.2, And now notice it accepted it?\n\n499\n00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.820\nAnd you don't necessarily have to do\na no shutdown command to turn it on,\n\n500\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.950\nthat switch is,\nthe interfaces are always on.\n\n501\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.750\nBut this is where you would do this and\nthis is for identification.\n\n502\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:22.090\nIt now has an IP address, looks just like\na regular computer has an IP address.\n\n503\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.140\nNow, on the switch and on a router, okay,\n\n504\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.740\nusually on a router, can be assigned\nby using other services like DHCP.\n\n505\n00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.460\nIn other words,\na server that can assign IP addresses.\n\n506\n00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.490\nYes you can, you can set it to do that.\n\n507\n00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.030\nOn a switch, not so much so,\nbut on a regular router,\n\n508\n00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.680\nyou definitely can do that.\n\n509\n00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.290\nBut for us, we statically showed you\nwhere you'll generally apply this.\n\n510\n00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.810\nInside of a regular PC that you have,\n\n511\n00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.340\nremember you'll actually be able\nto assign IP addresses here too.\n\n512\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.080\nAnd when you do this,\nyou're actually looking.\n\n513\n00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.620\nSo if you're like me on this\nWindows 10 machine, here.\n\n514\n00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:04.460\nYou can actually look for\nthe Internet network status and\n\n515\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.470\nyou can show the connection properties.\n\n516\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.330\nSo see this is changed\nup on me a little bit.\n\n517\n00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:09.830\nLet me see.\n\n518\n00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.540\nNetwork adapter options.\n\n519\n00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.490\nLet's try that one.\n\n520\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.220\nThere we go.\n\n521\n00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.330\nAdapter options.\n\n522\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.610\nThen I go to the properties\nof that adapter option.\n\n523\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.290\nSo like internet protocol version four and\nproperties.\n\n524\n00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.790\nAnd it's right here that I\ncan assign IP addresses here.\n\n525\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.850\nSo both of those, at least this way,\n\n526\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.100\nis actually the way you can do this on\nsomething like a windows machine and\n\n527\n00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.750\neven in a Linux machine, you'll have\nplaces where you can assign IP addresses.\n\n528\n00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.150\nBut, overall though,\n\n529\n00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.230\nthose are usually the applications you'll\nend up seeing whether on a router or\n\n530\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.240\na switch IP addresses can be assigned or\nused for something different.\n\n531\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.050\nBut that's kind of the basics\nhere as we start to take a look.\n\n532\n00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:56.290\nNow, there's still a bit\nmore to go on IP addressing.\n\n533\n00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.610\nBut, at this point though,\n\n534\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.090\nDaniel, this kind of really does end our\nlittle mini series and then we actually\n\n535\n00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:06.290\nget into some advanced stuff where we have\nto talk about breaking those rules and\n\n536\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:10.790\nhow to actually do that successfully.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it sounds like a lot of fun but\n\n537\n00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.090\nI hope you bring your pencils and\n\n538\n00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.570\npaper to get ready.\n&gt;&gt; To really hunker down,\n\n539\n00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.940\ncuz most people when they get\ninto that thing start going,\n\n540\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.510\nI don't know what's happening.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n541\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.400\n&gt;&gt; And it takes a little bit before the ha\n\n542\n00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.430\nmoments start occurring.\n\n543\n00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.640\nSo be prepared for\nthat because that is typical for\n\n544\n00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.330\nanybody that's getting new to this\nstuff that Ronnie is alluding to.\n\n545\n00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.720\nBut as for this, these basics, and Ronnie,\nit was a really good introduction of that.\n\n546\n00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.990\nThese foundational truths that\nRonnie has been explaining to us and\n\n547\n00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.770\nteaching us will really help and go a long\nway for us to be able to understand\n\n548\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.430\nthose more advanced topics when\nit comes to IP addressing.\n\n549\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.190\nSo Ronnie, we thank you so much for that.\n\n550\n00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.650\nThat being said, I'm looking at our clock.\n\n551\n00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.640\nIt's screaming for mercy.\n\n552\n00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.140\nWe'll give it a chance to cool\nits heels and call it a day.\n\n553\n00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.530\nWe do thank you for joining us though.\n\n554\n00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.424\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n555\n00:29:55.424 --> 00:29:56.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n556\n00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.230\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n557\n00:29:58.948 --> 00:30:04.378\n[MUSIC]\n\n558\n00:30:04.378 --> 00:30:07.140\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:13.907\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.907 --> 00:00:17.180\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.320\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.140\nIn today's episode we are back\nwith more of our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.170\nAnd joining us in this episode to, well,\nincrease our networking knowledge for\n\n9\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.650\nthat Cisco exam,\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.420\nRonnie, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.120\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel,\nthank you for having me on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.440\nToday we are diving into\nthe realm of subnetting.\n\n13\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, stop there.\n\n14\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not doing this,\n\n15\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.090\nit's gonna be too hard.\n\n16\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.460\nI don't want you to hurt these people.\n\n17\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.231\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] I don't either, but it is actually\n\n18\n00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:48.900\none of the more important topics on\nthe exam, and I say it is heavily tested.\n\n19\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; There is no ands, if, and\n\n20\n00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.180\nbuts about that.\n\n21\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.280\nIf you have gotten by in your\nnetworking up in this point and\n\n22\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.500\ngo, I don't have to learn subnetting.\n\n23\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.730\nAnd you're not starting phase\nCCENT as well as your CCNA.\n\n24\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.750\nYou're gonna have to know subnetting.\n\n25\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.440\nYou're just gonna have to know it.\n\n26\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.300\nSo we are of course going to introduce\nyou to the idea of subnetting.\n\n27\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.910\nNow I'm gonna take it relatively\nslow at the beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.800\nAnd then we'll show you later on,\nonce you get those basic concepts down,\n\n29\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.860\nwe'll show you how to do it quickly.\n\n30\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.850\nNow you might be wondering,\n\n31\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.460\nwell Rodney just show us the quick\npart because that's all that we need.\n\n32\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.741\nWell the problem is this, if you\ncan't remember some of those things.\n\n33\n00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.328\nSo, even out on the internet\nright now Daniel, I've seen so\n\n34\n00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:34.554\nmany videos that show like, here's\nthe quickest way to get through this.\n\n35\n00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:39.510\nWell as long as you can remember all those\ntips and trips you're fine on the exam.\n\n36\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.140\nI found out something when I'm\nexpected to answer within a minute and\n\n37\n00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.820\nI know I can't go back on\nthe questions which just goes in and\n\n38\n00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.660\nyou can't go back on, tips and\ntrips seem to kind of disappear.\n\n39\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.992\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:55.345\n&gt;&gt; It just disappear, so\n\n42\n00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:59.909\nwhat I want you to do is get solid\nfoundation of understanding how subnetting\n\n43\n00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.421\nworks.\n\n44\n00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:04.620\nBut once you get that, then doing\nthe tips and tricks, go for it, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.610\nAnd the reason why I say that is\nbecause if nothing else, right?\n\n46\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.020\nIf every single tip and\n\n47\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.180\ntrick that you learn about on\nthe internet to do this, if it fails.\n\n48\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.150\nIf you have the foundations to it,\nyou'll still be able to do it a little bit\n\n49\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.840\nslower, but the more that you practice,\nokay, on your own, and I mean this.\n\n50\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020\nI mean daily you want to\nbeing going through and\n\n51\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.290\ndoing this as you're getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n52\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.620\nAnd you come to 30 days before the exam,\nyou want to try and\n\n53\n00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.800\ndo one of these every hour\nas you're actually studying.\n\n54\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.180\nSo if you're only studying for three\nhours, make sure you do one an hour, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.190\nAnd then try and actually increase\nthat until the point where\n\n56\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.130\nit becomes second nature for\nyou to be able to do this.\n\n57\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.320\nIt's all because of\nthe timing on the exam.\n\n58\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.780\nSo let's talk just briefly here.\n\n59\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.280\nBecause this is where people get confused.\n\n60\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.800\nRemember when we talked about\njust basic math at the beginning?\n\n61\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.170\nYou and\nI learned the decimal system, right?\n\n62\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.110\nBase ten mathematics.\n\n63\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.298\nWe showed you about the place values.\n\n64\n00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:00.062\nAnd for\n\n65\n00:03:00.062 --> 00:03:03.610\nus, we also learned other different\nmathematic things that we can do, right?\n\n66\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.230\nMathematic computations of some sort,\nright, like multiplication, division,\n\n67\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.630\naddition, subtraction.\n\n68\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.580\nAll those things are what\nwe learned about.\n\n69\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.630\nAt this point, you and\nI have just done a basic conversion, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.880\nShowed you how you can actually arrive at\nbinary numbers, given a decimal number.\n\n71\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.540\nShowed you how you can\ntake a binary number and\n\n72\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.180\nof course convert it to decimal.\n\n73\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.930\nBut now we're getting into\nthe computational side of things, and\n\n74\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.150\nthat requires you to do things\na little bit different.\n\n75\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.990\nAll right, so Daniel I'm gonna test\nyour mathematical ability right now.\n\n76\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.515\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be a train wreck.\n\n77\n00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:36.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n78\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.650\nSo Daniel, 100 divided by 4 equals?\n\n79\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.970\n25.\n&gt;&gt; 25, okay.\n\n80\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.990\nYeah, you're right.\n\n81\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.810\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Whew.\n\n82\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah whew,\nyeah that whew very difficult.\n\n83\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.200\nBut yeah, 25, okay.\n\n84\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.900\nAnd the reason why I wanted to\ndo that is because essentially,\n\n85\n00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.740\nwhen it comes down to subnetting,\nit is just division, okay?\n\n86\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.050\nBut it's division with binary numbers.\n\n87\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.630\nSo everybody that kind of has this\nmystical approach about subnetting,\n\n88\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.100\nI kind of go, now that I've done it for\nyears and years,\n\n89\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.350\nit's really just dividing that one network\nnumber into multiple, smaller chunks.\n\n90\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.900\nJust like what Daniel\ndid like that at a snap.\n\n91\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.654\nWhen I said 100 divided by 4, he said, 25.\n\n92\n00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:19.420\nI wish he had said it\nwith more confidence.\n\n93\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.430\nBut, no, I'm joking,\nI know he was doing it [LAUGH] Well.\n\n94\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.800\n&gt;&gt; Me and math aren't friends.\n\n95\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.270\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping you would\ndo more of a confidence.\n\n96\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.008\nBut overall though,\nyeah that's what it breaks down to.\n\n97\n00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:35.647\nSo if you can remember that okay,\n\n98\n00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:41.430\nit really is just basic division okay,\nis what it comes down to.\n\n99\n00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.860\nThe hard part then is actually going,\nall right, so how do I take what I know,\n\n100\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.700\nlike that 100 divided by 4, and make that\ninto binary so it makes sense, okay.\n\n101\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.330\nSo that's what we're actually heading to,\n\n102\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.342\nthat's what it is that we\nhave to be able to do.\n\n103\n00:04:56.342 --> 00:04:58.330\nSo we're gonna start off by using,\nof course,\n\n104\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.570\nthe simplest examples of\nsubnetting that we can.\n\n105\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.580\nAnd that is what's usually\ncalled class C subnetting.\n\n106\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.630\nOkay, so we're gonna start off with\nthe smallest subnetting that we can, and\n\n107\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.870\nthen we'll move to harder subnetting.\n\n108\n00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.780\nNow, when I was working with\nTodd on the same series, right,\n\n109\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.540\nhe called this was easy subnetting.\n\n110\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.960\nAnd then he had his whole separate show on\nclass B sub-netting which was you know,\n\n111\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.100\nharder for him.\n\n112\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.220\nBut, not for him God, nothing was hard for\nhim in terms of subnetting.\n\n113\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.460\nHe just was able to spit\nit right off the bat.\n\n114\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.430\nBut overall though okay, it's easy and\nit's the place that we wanna begin, okay?\n\n115\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.920\nSo let's make sure that we understand what\nhappens at the very beginning her, okay?\n\n116\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.390\nSo we are gonna really just work\nwith class C addresses, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.680\nThat's what it comes down to,\nwe're gonna work with the class C address.\n\n118\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.782\nSo, let's determine how we figure out with\nthe class C address really means, okay?\n\n119\n00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:49.730\nSo, let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n120\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.730\nThe way that this process ends up working\nright, is that you have to determine\n\n121\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.570\nthe network ID of your given IP\naddress that you have, okay?\n\n122\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.431\nSo, my IP address is 192168 10.1.\n\n123\n00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:07.220\nNow usually, the other thing that gives\nit away, is gonna be the subnet mask.\n\n124\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.670\nThe subnet mask is what helps\nus to determine the network ID\n\n125\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.900\nof a given IP address.\n\n126\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.840\nYou should not see where a subnet mask\nis not reported with an IP address\n\n127\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.890\nbecause that's two.\n\n128\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.200\nExcuse me, an IP address is not\nreported without a subnet mask.\n\n129\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.190\nAnd that's too vague.\n\n130\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.340\nAnd that's because there's so\n\n131\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.050\nmany different possibilities that end up\ngoing wrong if you do something like that.\n\n132\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.880\nSo the way that that's actually\ndone is through a process, or\n\n133\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.220\na mathematical process,\nthat is called Binary ANDing, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.140\nBinary ANDing, and that's what we're gonna\ntake you through just briefly so that you\n\n135\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.340\nhave an understanding of how we arrived\nat this as being a class C address.\n\n136\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.470\nWe understand that at least from the table\nthat we created at the beginning where we\n\n137\n00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.480\ntalked about this pool,\n\n138\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.780\nthat the first 24 bits is actually\ngonna be your network portion.\n\n139\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.480\nHow do I know that for sure?\n\n140\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.170\nIs this just another,\ndo they just throw out numbers?\n\n141\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're throwing darts at a wall\nand whatever hits that's what it is?\n\n142\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, did someone just go,\nwell, let's see.\n\n143\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.420\nYeah, the first 24 bits sound good,\nlet's just make that happen.\n\n144\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.640\nNo, there's actually a mathematical\nprocess behind this.\n\n145\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.090\nSo the process is up here in\nthe upper left hand corner.\n\n146\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.180\nLet me see if I can get that\nmore on the screen over here.\n\n147\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.090\nTo line things up so\nthat you're not kind of cut off, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.690\nSo the way that it works is simple.\n\n149\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.885\nWith binary, you have,\nat least with these two lines of binary,\n\n150\n00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:33.872\nyou have four different possible\ncombinations here, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:33.872 --> 00:07:37.669\nBut only one combination is the one\nthat leads to an answer that we really\n\n152\n00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:38.920\nwant, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.783\nSo for example, Right here,\n\n154\n00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:47.179\nwhen you do binary ending\non the top line and\n\n155\n00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:50.842\nyou end it with the second one here,\n\n156\n00:07:50.842 --> 00:07:55.350\nwell a zero and a zero will equal a zero.\n\n157\n00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.235\nOkay, that's what it comes down to.\n\n158\n00:07:57.235 --> 00:08:03.161\nA one and a zero equal a zero, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:06.585\nA zero and a one,\nthat still equals a zero.\n\n160\n00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:07.820\nThe only one for\n\n161\n00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:14.010\nus that really is going to help us out\nis when we get a one and a one, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.470\nSo when we start doing\nsomething like this,\n\n163\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.460\nit's key to remember this combination.\n\n164\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.860\nIf we take the IP address and\nthe subnet mask itself\n\n165\n00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.460\nlike this and we convert them to binary\nwhich is what I've done over here.\n\n166\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.400\nI've converted them to binary, right here.\n\n167\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.010\nAlso I've done it wrong\nwhich is very possible.\n\n168\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.542\n&gt;&gt; Very possible.\n\n169\n00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:37.233\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So and\n\n170\n00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:39.590\nI then I converted\nthe subnet mask to binary,\n\n171\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.280\nwe can do the ending process here too,\nokay?\n\n172\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.072\nSo what I want you to actually see, and\n\n173\n00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:47.994\nI hope it actually shows up the way\nthat I think it's gonna be.\n\n174\n00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.197\nCuz if not it's gonna be embarrassing,\nokay?\n\n175\n00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:51.570\nA 1 and a 1 is what?\n\n176\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.739\nA 1, okay?\n\n177\n00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:56.308\nA 1 and a 1 is a 1, 0 and a 1, 0.\n\n178\n00:08:56.308 --> 00:09:00.720\n0 and a 1, 0, we start seeing that\nthrough, there's the first octet, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.980\nSo I just did a mathematical process and\ngot the answer, right?\n\n180\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.566\nThen we're gonna do the same thing here,\n1 1 is a 1, 0 1 is a 0,\n\n181\n00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:16.340\n1 1 is a 1, 0 1 is a 0, 1 1 is a 1, and\nthen the other three are exactly that.\n\n182\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.040\nAnd then this one,\nyou kinda follow the process here.\n\n183\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.860\nI'm not gonna keep repeating that\ncuz you can see what's going on.\n\n184\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.572\nAnd in this last one right here everything\nkind of ends up being that idea of\n\n185\n00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:29.980\nzeros, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.170\nSo if you do the ending process, now,\nif you haven't seen this before,\n\n187\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.570\nthis was kind of the first moment that\nthings weren't just at least when I\n\n188\n00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.570\nstarted learning all that, whoa,\nhow did the heck did I do it?\n\n189\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.620\nRemember, we went through\na mathematical process, right?\n\n190\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.160\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n191\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.970\n&gt;&gt; But when we through the mathematical\nprocess, notice the first three octets\n\n192\n00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:53.390\nhere and\ncompare them to what the result is.\n\n193\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.410\nAnd you'll see that they're identical,\nokay?\n\n194\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:03.170\nSo notice that the result from this\nmask here are from this IP address.\n\n195\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.850\nEnding it with the subnet mask,\nit gave me the exact same answer,\n\n196\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.790\nat least through these first three octets.\n\n197\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.580\nBut notice that the second, or\nthe third, or fourth, sorry.\n\n198\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.430\nI'm not gonna be able to say anything.\n\n199\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.580\nThe fourth octet, ending it with these 0s,\n\n200\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.970\nit gave me a different answer this time,\nokay?\n\n201\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.020\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n202\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.602\nThat means if you take a look,\nwhat essentially fell through, right?\n\n203\n00:10:28.602 --> 00:10:32.867\nWhatever comes through in binary ANDing,\n\n204\n00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:38.201\nthat is going to actually\nrepresent your network ID.\n\n205\n00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:43.140\nOr the network portion, okay?\n\n206\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.890\nSo the network ID here, and that means for\nus that's gonna be 192.168.10., and\n\n207\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:54.150\nthen whatever, okay,\ncuz we didn't actually get that.\n\n208\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.740\nSo our network essentially is gonna\nbe something like that for right now.\n\n209\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.780\nNow, the other thing that this\nending process helps you with\n\n210\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.520\nwhat you want to know for the exam,\nis when you have to determine whether or\n\n211\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.370\nnot these two machines\nare on the same network.\n\n212\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.570\nBecause it can be different depending\non what you have available.\n\n213\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.010\nSo for example, if we were to change this,\nand do something like this here, so\n\n214\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:26.200\nlet me change this to an 11 and\nnow we'll just do something like that.\n\n215\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.320\nSo just as easy.\n\n216\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.360\nSo now I just go ahead and do this and\nI change that, okay, for the third octet.\n\n217\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.320\nNow if we go through the ending process,\nwe understand that at least the first\n\n218\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.870\ntwo octets it will be the same,\nbut now with the third one,\n\n219\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.290\nnotice that this time though, it changes.\n\n220\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.930\nSo if the number changes in\nthe network portion, that means what?\n\n221\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.550\nThat they're not on the same network,\nokay?\n\n222\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.710\nSo, it makes sense.\n\n223\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:02.110\nSo, the ANDing process has more than just\nsubnetting that's identified with it.\n\n224\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.410\nBut you can see now where, if you have to\ncompare, are these two in the same subnet?\n\n225\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.890\nAnd if you're not sure\njust by looking at it,\n\n226\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.740\nyou can always start\ndoing the ANDing process.\n\n227\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.320\nYou can do exactly like I did here.\n\n228\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.900\nYou don't have to actually\ndo the entire thing again.\n\n229\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.900\nJust take that octet,\nsome people call it the active octet or\n\n230\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.030\nthe interesting octet,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n231\n00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.050\nJust take that one, and\nchange it to that number.\n\n232\n00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.940\nIf you have matching ones in the beginning\nhere, change which ever one it is and\n\n233\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.680\nthat way you can identify whether or\nnot it's actually that.\n\n234\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.423\nSo that will help you on a side note but\n\n235\n00:12:33.423 --> 00:12:36.250\nit's actually very important\nthat we emphasize that too.\n\n236\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.800\nSo it does help us.\n\n237\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.019\nSo this is how I can determine that\nthis is a Class C address because what?\n\n238\n00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:46.873\nThe first 24 bits actually match\nup to exactly what they said and\n\n239\n00:12:46.873 --> 00:12:51.286\nthat's the way that a Class C\nis actually identified is that\n\n240\n00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:55.190\nthe first 24 bits are going\nto be a Class C address.\n\n241\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.070\nSo that is where we start off.\n\n242\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.520\nSo once we actually determine that, right,\n\n243\n00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.160\nwe now have to ask why the heck do we need\nto ever subdivide something like this?\n\n244\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.600\nWell a lot of times,\nat the very beginning,\n\n245\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.770\nit was just to conserve address space.\n\n246\n00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.860\nJust like what we talked about in\nvariable length subnet mask, okay?\n\n247\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.311\nThe very fact is ISPs start saying look,\nnot every company\n\n248\n00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:23.330\nneeds 254 addresses or 16,384 addresses.\n\n249\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.988\nWhat if we could actually just give\nthem a sliver of that, in other words,\n\n250\n00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:30.705\njust give them the number that they\nrequested such as hem or, not usually,\n\n251\n00:13:30.705 --> 00:13:33.720\nyeah you could do something like that,\ntwo if you wanted to.\n\n252\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.970\nBut that's what you have, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.140\nSo you can do something like,\njust by doing that.\n\n254\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.350\nSo it's about conserving address to help\nslow down what we were talking about.\n\n255\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.370\nSo out on the Internet, that's cool.\n\n256\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.530\nNow what about within a network though,\nwithin a LAN?\n\n257\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.510\nWell let's say that Daniel\nis actually assigned this.\n\n258\n00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.630\nHe's given an IP address but\nDaniel is responsible for\n\n259\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.230\nfour or five different networks.\n\n260\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.030\nBut he's only given one IP address, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.330\nOr one block of IP address I should say,\nlike a class C address.\n\n262\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.950\nAnd he said you just take that network and\nyou divide it the way that you want to.\n\n263\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.030\nBut that's where the challenge that\nyou and I tend to have more often\n\n264\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.730\nis dividing it up that way and\nmaking it the way that we need to.\n\n265\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.150\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, this really comes into play\nas we start designing our network and\n\n266\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.470\nto say, well I don't need all\nthese superfluous addresses.\n\n267\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.180\nI only have x amount of machines on each\ndifferent network that I want to build.\n\n268\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; And then I want to connect them.\n\n269\n00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.230\nSo what's the best way to go about that?\n\n270\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.110\nAnd that's when it really comes into play\nwith your IP address scheming, right?\n\n271\n00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYeah, and\n\n272\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.350\nthat's going to be important part of\nsubnet that you'll end up doing later on.\n\n273\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.490\nTowards your CCNP and your design courses,\n\n274\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.110\nis that you have to kind of design\nthem for what you need at that point.\n\n275\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.120\n&gt;&gt; But it all starts right here.\n\n276\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.790\n&gt;&gt; It starts right here.\n\n277\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.180\n&gt;&gt; With being able to do this subnetting.\n\n278\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Yep, with being able to\nactually kind of go all right,\n\n279\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.790\nI just realized something, here it is.\n\n280\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.320\nDaniel's got one big network, but\nhe needs five smaller networks.\n\n281\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.520\nOr he needs six smaller networks.\n\n282\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.270\nOr whatever it might be Daniel's\ngotta be able to take that and\n\n283\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:00.270\nthen essentially divide it up properly\naccording to the binary to make it work.\n\n284\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.060\nSo Daniel can't just go well let's see,\nI'll just make this one this number and\n\n285\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.900\nI'll make this one this number and\nmake that work.\n\n286\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.980\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you Ronnie, it wasn't until\nthis, what we're talking about right\n\n287\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.800\nnow that those light bulbs\nstarted going off in my head.\n\n288\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.182\nAnd I was like, we're doing this for\na reason, we're not just like,\n\n289\n00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:21.655\nbecause it's theoretically impossible or\nfun for some crazy person.\n\n290\n00:15:21.655 --> 00:15:24.348\nThis has a purpose, and\nnow because that context,\n\n291\n00:15:24.348 --> 00:15:27.991\nI'm applying it to what I'm doing and\nit made a whole lot more sense.\n\n292\n00:15:27.991 --> 00:15:28.975\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n293\n00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:33.903\n&gt;&gt; You have four networks, the largest\namount of hosts on a network on\n\n294\n00:15:33.903 --> 00:15:37.420\nany network you have is gonna be 12 hosts.\n\n295\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.210\nWhat is the IP address scheming that\nyou should do to break those up and\n\n296\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.380\nsegment those networks?\n\n297\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.510\nBoom, all of a sudden, like I said,\nthe lights went off, the heavens opened,\n\n298\n00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.040\nangels descended, it was great.\n\n299\n00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.937\nAnd then when that stuff made sense,\n\n300\n00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:51.557\nthis stuff started really the tumblers\nfell into place for me on that.\n\n301\n00:15:51.557 --> 00:15:52.739\n&gt;&gt; All right, I agree,\n\n302\n00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:57.206\nonce I actually started seeing the context\nof it and realizing what it could do for\n\n303\n00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:01.496\nme, it really started make more sense\nof why I would choose to do this, okay?\n\n304\n00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:03.129\nNow in reality, right?\n\n305\n00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.595\nI just copied over with the last line,\nso that we can start off.\n\n306\n00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:10.487\nWhen it begins with subnet especially\nwith class C subnetting, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:10.487 --> 00:16:14.400\nWe don't have to worry that I was given\nthis extra host number right here, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.730\nYou don't have to worry about that at all,\n\n309\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.570\nwhat we're paying attention to when\nwe start doing subnetting at the very\n\n310\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.680\nbeginning, right?\n\n311\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.144\nIs only the network portion itself,\nthat portion remains stable okay,\n\n312\n00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:29.892\nyou are not gonna touch At least\nin the regular portion of this,\n\n313\n00:16:29.892 --> 00:16:32.146\nright, are those 24 bits.\n\n314\n00:16:32.146 --> 00:16:36.378\nSo the only portion that you\nare going to be manipulating\n\n315\n00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:39.087\nat all are these eight bits itself.\n\n316\n00:16:39.087 --> 00:16:43.046\n&gt;&gt; And emphasize again in a Class C,\na Class B or a Class A, whatever.\n\n317\n00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:47.481\nWhatever your subnet mask tells you, that\nis the important portion of this, right?\n\n318\n00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:50.870\nSo I would get confused when I\nfirst started learning this.\n\n319\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.201\nI'd go, well why in this problem\nare we only over here in these 8 bits?\n\n320\n00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:57.827\nBut in this next problem we have 12 bits?\n\n321\n00:16:57.827 --> 00:16:59.509\nIt wasn't making any sense, so\n\n322\n00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:03.450\nthat subnet mask is very important\nto what's getting manipulated where.\n\n323\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.068\n&gt;&gt; Right, so yeah,\n\n324\n00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:06.683\nwe'll talk about that once we get into\nclass B because it's gonna change.\n\n325\n00:17:06.683 --> 00:17:08.470\nit looks weird, it does.\n\n326\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.977\nBecause yeah, and\nwe'll see it's just a mental game, but\n\n327\n00:17:10.977 --> 00:17:12.793\nit's kind of the same process over again.\n\n328\n00:17:12.793 --> 00:17:17.564\nBut let's start with this particular\naddress here when we get started.\n\n329\n00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:21.523\nSo when we start to do this,\nthe key like we said, really begins here.\n\n330\n00:17:21.523 --> 00:17:26.023\nMake sure I can identify what my network\nID is and if you're not sure just\n\n331\n00:17:26.023 --> 00:17:30.598\nbecause you don't know what the table\nis that we did, do binary ending.\n\n332\n00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:36.850\nMake sure you get your Class C Network\nidentified at the very beginning, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:41.081\nOnce you identify that, now,\nwhat you have to do is,\n\n334\n00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:44.383\ngiven whatever your scenario is, okay?\n\n335\n00:17:44.383 --> 00:17:48.203\nThat you want to actually create well,\nmultiple, but\n\n336\n00:17:48.203 --> 00:17:52.290\nsmaller networks from that\none network here, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:57.617\nSo remember that, for us,\non a class C, we have one network.\n\n338\n00:17:57.617 --> 00:18:02.300\nPossibility of 254 hosts, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.996\nSo, the reason why I'm emphasizing that\nright now is because I know if I create\n\n340\n00:18:05.996 --> 00:18:09.527\nmultiple networks, Daniel,\njust like I've said in a previous episode.\n\n341\n00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:13.414\nThat if I start creating smaller networks\nand I start adding up the number of hosts\n\n342\n00:18:13.414 --> 00:18:16.380\nthat I think I have, and\nI come up with 300, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.387\nThen something I did is wrong.\n\n344\n00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:18.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's wrong.\n\n345\n00:18:18.412 --> 00:18:20.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely wrong.\n\n346\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.687\nSo, That should be the maximum number\nthat you come up with after you divide\n\n347\n00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:24.835\neverything up, right?\n\n348\n00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:28.297\nSo Daniel, let's start with\nthis idea here of division, and\n\n349\n00:18:28.297 --> 00:18:32.042\nlet's show how this is done in\nbinary at this point as well, okay?\n\n350\n00:18:32.042 --> 00:18:37.702\nSo Daniel, let's go ahead and see, I'll\nlet you give me a scenario here, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:41.140\nSo let's make it a relatively small\nnumber so we don't bore everybody.\n\n352\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.157\n&gt;&gt; Right, just keep it easy.\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel,\n\n353\n00:18:42.157 --> 00:18:46.270\nhow many networks should we try and\ncreate out of this class C?\n\n354\n00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.159\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with four.\n\n355\n00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:50.257\n&gt;&gt; Four, okay,\nthat's actually a great number, okay?\n\n356\n00:18:50.257 --> 00:18:52.210\nSo four networks are needed.\n\n357\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:57.346\nAll right now, when we get that number,\nthat four networks\n\n358\n00:18:57.346 --> 00:19:02.185\nthat's needed, remember that for\nus we are dividing.\n\n359\n00:19:02.185 --> 00:19:06.066\nBut, I know that this portion\ncannot be touched, yet\n\n360\n00:19:06.066 --> 00:19:09.920\nI want to actually make more networks,\nokay?\n\n361\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.866\nDaniel, right now I only\nhave one network doing this.\n\n362\n00:19:12.866 --> 00:19:15.700\nIn these,\nI can't take any bits from over here.\n\n363\n00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.666\nBut if I need to actually\nmake smaller networks.\n\n364\n00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:21.245\nIt means I need to go ahead and\nactually add in or\n\n365\n00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:24.930\nborrow if you want that's\nusually the technical term here.\n\n366\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:30.588\nBorrow additional bits over on this side,\non the side that's not highlighted,\n\n367\n00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:34.763\nthat will allow me to create\nfour smaller networks, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:34.763 --> 00:19:38.773\nSo this is where it goes back\nto that binary once again, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:38.773 --> 00:19:43.343\nSo how many bits do I need\nto make the number four is\n\n370\n00:19:43.343 --> 00:19:46.460\nwhat I want to come up with?\n\n371\n00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.388\nSo if I take a look.\n\n372\n00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:53.970\nIf I do just a one bit If I add in just\none more bit over to the network side.\n\n373\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:59.321\nOkay, if I only do that,\nI have a possibility of a one and a zero.\n\n374\n00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:01.780\nOkay, and that gives me two.\n\n375\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.684\nSo that doesn't fulfill what I need.\n\n376\n00:20:04.684 --> 00:20:08.930\nBut now, if I do this though, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.464\nAnd I add in a second bit,\n\n378\n00:20:10.464 --> 00:20:14.421\nwill that give me four possible\ncombinations of those two bits?\n\n379\n00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:18.170\nSo let's take a little\nbit of time here and see.\n\n380\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.589\nSo what a 1 and\n\n381\n00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:24.242\na 0, well that's actually equal to\ntwo networks that I can actually do.\n\n382\n00:20:24.242 --> 00:20:27.026\nBut then we actually add in two bits.\n\n383\n00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:32.457\nI can actually have these possible\ncombinations 00, 01, 10 and 11, okay?\n\n384\n00:20:32.457 --> 00:20:36.825\nEach one of those can now\nactually become a network and\n\n385\n00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:39.454\nwe'll show you how that works.\n\n386\n00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:42.260\nBut for right now,\njust kind of follow the logic.\n\n387\n00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.263\nSo what you do is you do this, right?\n\n388\n00:20:44.263 --> 00:20:49.495\nGiven four networks,\ndetermine the number of bits I need\n\n389\n00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:55.290\nto borrow from the host side\nthat will give me that, okay?\n\n390\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.084\nThat amount of networks,\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n391\n00:20:58.084 --> 00:21:02.557\nSo I know that I'm essentially\ngonna be borrowing 2.bits here.\n\n392\n00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:06.449\nNow once I borrow those 2 bits,\nand let me get rid of this so\n\n393\n00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:09.712\nthat it's not blocking what I need here,\nokay?\n\n394\n00:21:09.712 --> 00:21:13.686\nI wanna go ahead and\nchange my subnet mask to match.\n\n395\n00:21:13.686 --> 00:21:18.431\nSo the way that I do that,\nright, if I were to do binary\n\n396\n00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:23.460\nending is that I would\njust simply do this, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.852\nAnd add that in.\n\n398\n00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:29.226\nAnd now I have a new subnet mask for\nmy four smaller subnets.\n\n399\n00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:35.110\nAnd that would be 255.255.255 and then\nlet's do our kind of binary math here.\n\n400\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.533\nThat's 128 plus 64, that's gonna be 192.\n\n401\n00:21:38.533 --> 00:21:40.920\nAnd the rest are 0s.\n\n402\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:51.710\nAnd now for my smaller networks,\nOkay, now I have a new subnet mask.\n\n403\n00:21:55.934 --> 00:21:58.670\nOops, let me change that once\nI get it pasted down here.\n\n404\n00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.748\n[LAUGH] I still didn't change it though.\n\n405\n00:22:02.748 --> 00:22:03.790\nNo, that did, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:19.640\nLet me just leave that blank.\n\n407\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.667\nI was trying to do this so\nit would line up.\n\n408\n00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.299\nBut there we go, okay.\n\n409\n00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:28.015\nSo now I've got anew subnet mask\nthat will be assigned to each\n\n410\n00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:31.994\nof my new networks,\nwhich is gonna be here, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:31.994 --> 00:22:35.018\nSo how do we determine the network step,\nokay?\n\n412\n00:22:35.018 --> 00:22:39.468\nWell, now I can change these two\ncombinations up here at the top for\n\n413\n00:22:39.468 --> 00:22:41.620\nthe network portion.\n\n414\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.749\nBut let's go ahead and do that.\n\n415\n00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:46.647\nNow, we're not paying attention to\nthis last number here so much anymore.\n\n416\n00:22:46.647 --> 00:22:49.493\nLet me copy this one.\n\n417\n00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:55.492\nOn my first network then It's\n\n418\n00:22:55.492 --> 00:23:01.165\nactually this one right here,\nwell there we go.\n\n419\n00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:07.619\nThat's gonna be 168.10.0\nwith that new subnet mask.\n\n420\n00:23:10.247 --> 00:23:17.475\nAnd now let's determine\nthe second one Copy.\n\n421\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.848\nPaste this one down here.\n\n422\n00:23:22.848 --> 00:23:27.481\nSo this is gonna be first,\n\n423\n00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:30.858\nor first network.\n\n424\n00:23:30.858 --> 00:23:36.419\nOur second one, we'll start with the\nlowest order bit that I can change here.\n\n425\n00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:39.187\nAnd now I wanna take a look\nat this network number.\n\n426\n00:23:39.187 --> 00:23:43.702\nIt's gonna be 192.168.10 because\nI can't touch this number right?\n\n427\n00:23:43.702 --> 00:23:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n428\n00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.478\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel if I\nconvert this to decimal.\n\n429\n00:23:48.478 --> 00:23:52.112\nI don't need the 128 but I do need what?\n\n430\n00:23:52.112 --> 00:23:57.304\nThe 64, so\nthis now becomes the second one.\n\n431\n00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:00.610\nWhich is gonna be the second-\n\n432\n00:24:03.845 --> 00:24:07.124\nAnd now, I'll flip those two bits again.\n\n433\n00:24:17.208 --> 00:24:20.100\nAnd now I have to change this,\ncuz I forgot.\n\n434\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.600\n64.\n\n435\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.932\nSo now this one becomes a 10, like that.\n\n436\n00:24:28.672 --> 00:24:35.518\nAnd so now if we take a look at\nthis last octet then, Daniel?\n\n437\n00:24:35.518 --> 00:24:40.470\nThat becomes, is that 128?\n\n438\n00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.592\n&gt;&gt; 128?\n&gt;&gt; 128, and\n\n439\n00:24:42.592 --> 00:24:47.109\nthis becomes our third network.\n\n440\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.630\n128.\n\n441\n00:24:55.051 --> 00:24:58.522\nAnd why would it actually line\nup exactly the way I want it to?\n\n442\n00:24:58.522 --> 00:25:00.102\n&gt;&gt; Because they don't really want to.\n[LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:25:00.102 --> 00:25:01.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:25:01.244 --> 00:25:02.015\nCome on.\n\n445\n00:25:02.015 --> 00:25:03.697\nAnd then we'll have one more,\n\n446\n00:25:03.697 --> 00:25:06.810\nwhich actually changes those\ntwo bits that we borrowed.\n\n447\n00:25:12.071 --> 00:25:18.987\nTwo.\n\n448\n00:25:18.987 --> 00:25:22.211\nAnd so if we convert that,\n\n449\n00:25:22.211 --> 00:25:27.496\nthat's 128 + 64, which is 192.\n\n450\n00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:29.202\nAnd this will now be our 4th network.\n\n451\n00:25:30.727 --> 00:25:38.717\nLet me see if I can get that to float\nup to the top here just a little bit.\n\n452\n00:25:38.717 --> 00:25:40.658\n&gt;&gt; Looks good.\n\n453\n00:25:40.658 --> 00:25:43.721\n&gt;&gt; So at the beginning here,\n\n454\n00:25:43.721 --> 00:25:49.855\nlet's separate that out a little bit more,\nright?\n\n455\n00:25:49.855 --> 00:25:51.631\nChange up the numbers to what we got.\n\n456\n00:25:51.631 --> 00:25:54.430\nWe started off with this one\nnetwork up here at the top.\n\n457\n00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.329\nAnd now that we've actually\nidentified the network ID.\n\n458\n00:25:58.329 --> 00:26:03.184\nWe took the number that we were given,\nand we essentially added or\n\n459\n00:26:03.184 --> 00:26:08.235\nborrowed from the host bit side,\nthe combinations that we needed.\n\n460\n00:26:08.235 --> 00:26:15.921\nSo notice that\nthe combinations here change.\n\n461\n00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:19.320\n11, 01, 10, and 11.\n\n462\n00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.093\nWe also, of course,\nended up with a new subnet mask now that\n\n463\n00:26:24.093 --> 00:26:27.533\nactually identifies them as well, okay?\n\n464\n00:26:27.533 --> 00:26:33.242\nSo that is how we can do some basic\nsubnetting as we actually begin here,\n\n465\n00:26:33.242 --> 00:26:34.240\nokay?\n\n466\n00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.439\nSo in this first instance here,\nas we starting doing this just as a basis,\n\n467\n00:26:38.439 --> 00:26:41.239\nnotice that what we've done,\nDaniel, right?\n\n468\n00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:43.930\nIs that we've taken that one network,\nokay?\n\n469\n00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.119\nThe 192.168.10.1 network, yeah,\nactually is just 10 network here.\n\n470\n00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:51.280\nAnd we started off with the 10 network.\n\n471\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.648\nAnd then we divided them\ninto four smaller numbers.\n\n472\n00:26:54.648 --> 00:26:59.322\nAt this point,\nI have less number of bits in the host\n\n473\n00:26:59.322 --> 00:27:02.378\nside than I had at the beginning.\n\n474\n00:27:02.378 --> 00:27:04.584\nSo when I take a look at this, right?\n\n475\n00:27:04.584 --> 00:27:08.944\nThis is 2 to the sixth power,\nnumber of hosts that I have left.\n\n476\n00:27:08.944 --> 00:27:13.696\nAnd that means, instead of me\nhaving one big network with 254\n\n477\n00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:18.714\nhosts like we did at the beginning,\nwe now have one of these networks\n\n478\n00:27:18.714 --> 00:27:23.398\nthat has essentially 32 binary\ncombinations that we can do.\n\n479\n00:27:23.398 --> 00:27:25.440\nBut we'll also have to kind\nof reduce that a little bit.\n\n480\n00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.980\nAnd we have needed go over that part too.\n\n481\n00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.975\nNow, Daniel?\nWe need to actually understand this\n\n482\n00:27:29.975 --> 00:27:34.070\nbecause we have to determine now, not only\nthe network ID, which we have to do that,\n\n483\n00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.885\ncuz we've kind of given you\nthe network ID at this point.\n\n484\n00:27:36.885 --> 00:27:39.658\nBut we need to determine the broadcast,\nas well as the network range,\n\n485\n00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:40.838\nthat we have available to us.\n\n486\n00:27:40.838 --> 00:27:43.060\nSo we'll do that in the next episode.\n\n487\n00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.150\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell it's a lot of information to cover.\n\n488\n00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.083\nWe don't open the fire hose on you and\nsay, have a drink, right?\n\n489\n00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:51.485\nBut I'm sure they'd take this\nin small digestible chunks,\n\n490\n00:27:51.485 --> 00:27:53.839\ncuz that's what's gonna give\nyou some success with this,\n\n491\n00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:56.966\nmaking sure you understand those concepts\nbefore we move on to the next thing.\n\n492\n00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:59.301\nHopefully you've gotten\nbinary ending down, and\n\n493\n00:27:59.301 --> 00:28:02.186\nstarting to get that subnetting\nbusiness down pretty easily.\n\n494\n00:28:02.186 --> 00:28:03.717\nIt's not too difficult so far-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n495\n00:28:03.717 --> 00:28:05.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna [INAUDIBLE] for\n\n496\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.490\nit in the next episode.\n\n497\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.167\nSo go take that, and bring it in,\ntake it down, enjoy.\n\n498\n00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:11.228\nAnd then come back for that next episode.\n\n499\n00:28:11.228 --> 00:28:13.472\nRonnie, thanks so\nmuch for getting us here.\n\n500\n00:28:13.472 --> 00:28:15.544\nWe're gonna have to continue\non because you're right,\n\n501\n00:28:15.544 --> 00:28:16.883\nwe don't have quite enough time-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:28:16.883 --> 00:28:19.357\n&gt;&gt; To continue on our track here.\n\n503\n00:28:19.357 --> 00:28:21.968\nSo thanks for joining us today,\nwe'll see you in the next episode.\n\n504\n00:28:21.968 --> 00:28:25.077\nThank you also for joining us, we always\nappreciate our viewers out there.\n\n505\n00:28:25.077 --> 00:28:26.340\nHopefully, you've enjoyed it so far.\n\n506\n00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.385\nAnd we're gonna sign off.\n\n507\n00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:29.587\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n508\n00:28:29.587 -->

00:00:08.153\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:12.731\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.892\ngreetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:20.914\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, you're in for a treat,\n\n7\n00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:22.474\nit's more of our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:25.993\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, the subnetting master himself,\n\n9\n00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.762\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:31.343\nRonnie, welcome back, sir, how goes it?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Daniel, here we are,\n\n11\n00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:32.243\nwe're in a part two.\n\n12\n00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:35.267\nWho would have guessed that I would\nhave talked that long on subnetting?\n\n13\n00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:39.514\nBut there's a little bit more for\nus to go as far as Class C subnetting.\n\n14\n00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:43.894\nAnd then we'll probably dive into\nClass B subnetting in another episode.\n\n15\n00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:49.493\nAnd hopefully tie in in that episode,\nhow do I get fast at doing this?\n\n16\n00:00:49.493 --> 00:00:51.373\nAnd that's going to be very important.\n\n17\n00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:54.029\nI wish I could tell you that\nyou're only going to face one or\n\n18\n00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:56.105\ntwo questions on the exam\nabout subnetting.\n\n19\n00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.535\nEven if they don't directly ask you\nabout subnetting, I guarantee you,\n\n20\n00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:02.043\nyou're going to see subnetting\nquestions on there.\n\n21\n00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:06.065\nYou're going go, my gosh, do I really\nhave to, yes, you have to know it, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.833\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at where we left off, and\n\n23\n00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:10.350\nthen we'll pick up from here.\n\n24\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.062\nSo at this point, remember we have\ntaken this one big network here,\n\n25\n00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:20.862\nthe network ID of 192.168.10.0,\nand we've divided it up into four.\n\n26\n00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:25.075\nSmaller, but equal networks,\nis what we've actually ended up doing,\n\n27\n00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:27.918\nbecause that was our\nnetwork requirement here.\n\n28\n00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:30.461\nFour smaller but equal networks, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:34.473\nSo one big network, 254 hosts,\nnow I have four networks, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:37.819\nSo now we also need to\ndetermine the network ID,\n\n31\n00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.933\nas well as the broadcast ID, and\nthe range of each one of these networks.\n\n32\n00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.834\nIt's going to become important\nthat you can do this.\n\n33\n00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:49.002\nIt's not so important that you do\nit exactly the same way that I did,\n\n34\n00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:50.957\nit is important that you see the concept.\n\n35\n00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:54.663\nWe're starting from ground\nzero here making sure that\n\n36\n00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:58.621\nyou understand how this happens and\nthat you can see this.\n\n37\n00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.314\nSo let's go ahead and start off and\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n38\n00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:07.000\nSo in a previous episode, I mentioned\nthat the key to understanding and\n\n39\n00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.982\nfinding the network ID\nhas to deal in binary.\n\n40\n00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:12.950\nIf you can't tell it from\nwhat you see right here,\n\n41\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.433\nin the number that you're given, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.485\nNotice that this is no longer just simple,\n\n43\n00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:20.336\nlike everything that we've done\nat some point in a Class C.\n\n44\n00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:24.692\nUser network is really one network, which\nactually begins with 0 a lot of times.\n\n45\n00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:29.665\nWell, now notice that these\nnetworks begin with like 64, 128,\n\n46\n00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:32.802\n192, notice that they change, right?\n\n47\n00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:35.442\nSo how do we determine the network ID?\n\n48\n00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.206\nIn a previous episode,\n\n49\n00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:42.064\nI mentioned that what we have to do\nthen at that point is in binary.\n\n50\n00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:47.767\nIf all of the binary host bits,\nwhich for us here are six bits,\n\n51\n00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:53.484\nis actually going to be zeroes,\nthen that is your network ID.\n\n52\n00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:58.745\nOkay, so at this point here, okay,\nthis is going to be our network ID,\n\n53\n00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.832\njust to make it match\nin what we need to do.\n\n54\n00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:06.437\nNow the other number that\nwe also must determine then\n\n55\n00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:10.423\nis going to be the broadcast address,\nokay?\n\n56\n00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:14.325\nI'm going to copy this,\nand hopefully down here,\n\n57\n00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:19.243\nlet's see if I can make,\nhopefully not a complete mess of this.\n\n58\n00:03:19.243 --> 00:03:26.961\nI want to determine the broadcast ID,\nso what is my broadcast ID?\n\n59\n00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.116\nLet's see, Broadcast ID.\n\n60\n00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:35.983\nRemember that the broadcast ID is,\nonce again,\n\n61\n00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:44.546\nwhere I reminded us that a broadcast ID is\nidentified where all the host bits, right?\n\n62\n00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:47.590\nAre binary ones, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.109\nRemember that these two at the beginning\nare no longer considered part of the host\n\n64\n00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.115\nitself anymore.\n\n65\n00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:56.088\nIt is what is remaining,\nwhich are these six bits, so\n\n66\n00:03:56.088 --> 00:03:58.481\nhow do I determine what\nthis is going to be?\n\n67\n00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.515\nWell, you start adding it up, so\n\n68\n00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:07.274\nthis is 32 plus 16, which is 48,\n\n69\n00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:11.828\n48 plus 8 is 56, right?\n&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah,\n\n70\n00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:16.318\nI think that's right.\n&gt;&gt; 56, and then 56 plus 4 is 60.\n\n71\n00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:24.112\n60 plus 2 is 62, 62 plus 1,\nthat should be 63.\n\n72\n00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.367\nOkay?\n\n73\n00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:30.567\nSo that is going to be my Broadcast ID.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I noticed something,\n\n74\n00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:31.620\nreally quickly.\n&gt;&gt; What'd you notice?\n\n75\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.300\n&gt;&gt; I want to put that out there,\n\n76\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.029\nwas that it's the number\nthat's right before\n\n77\n00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.303\nthe Network ID.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n78\n00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:39.749\nSo there's a quick method that\nactually you gets you faster, right,\n\n79\n00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.002\nat some of these things that you'll\nhave to be able to identify.\n\n80\n00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:42.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:44.355\n&gt;&gt; So if you already determine what\n\n82\n00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:48.206\nthe subnet is, and you go, I don't want\nto do all that and add that all up.\n\n83\n00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:52.552\nJust look at whatever the next\nnetwork is going to be, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:55.465\nAnd then just subtract one,\nand you're right,\n\n85\n00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:58.743\nDaniel, that will always\nbe the broadcast ID, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:58.743 --> 00:05:03.465\nNow that also means we have to\ndetermine a range of addresses too, so,\n\n87\n00:05:03.465 --> 00:05:06.036\nhow does a range of addresses come up?\n\n88\n00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:11.264\nWell, if it can't be where\nhost bits are all ones, right?\n\n89\n00:05:11.264 --> 00:05:11.855\nOkay?\n\n90\n00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:15.845\nThe range, all you have to do is flip\nthe least significant bit to what?\n\n91\n00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:17.205\nTo a one, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:17.205 --> 00:05:20.443\nAnd that's where the range begins, so\n\n93\n00:05:20.443 --> 00:05:24.973\nin theory, the range is 192.168.10.1.\n\n94\n00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:29.009\nAnd then on the top end,\nif it can't be all this,\n\n95\n00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.243\nI just change this to a 0,\nthe least significant bit, I flip.\n\n96\n00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:36.231\nAnd I change that and\n\n97\n00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:42.229\nthen now this becomes 192.168.10.62.\n&gt;&gt; 2.\n\n98\n00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.093\n&gt;&gt; 2.\n\n99\n00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:46.715\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is actually going to be\n\n101\n00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:53.883\nthe range, I tell you, you can't rely\non my particular typing at all, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:53.883 --> 00:05:55.776\nSo that's going to be our range.\n\n103\n00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:58.993\nSo, I'm not taking us through the binary\nagain because I'm hoping that you're\n\n104\n00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:00.762\nstarting to go, I'm getting the pattern.\n\n105\n00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:03.739\nI'm starting to see what's happening.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, based off of that, I'm mapping\n\n106\n00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.581\nnetworks out in my head right now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n107\n00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:06.520\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it's just,\n\n108\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.962\nyou know a couple of things and next\nthing you know, you've got everything you\n\n109\n00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:12.625\nneed to know for each network.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it really does,\n\n110\n00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.031\nit helps you out here, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.281\nBecause what you can also\nend up seeing here, right,\n\n112\n00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:19.285\nlet's say we're actually given\nsomething like these four networks.\n\n113\n00:06:19.285 --> 00:06:22.635\nWell, what if somebody were to say,\nhey, are these two in the same network?\n\n114\n00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:27.364\nSo let's go ahead and find a range of\naddresses for this one now too, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:31.763\nSo if we were to determine a range\nof addresses for the 64 network.\n\n116\n00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:36.344\nSo this would be 192.168.10, and\nI know 64 is what, my network ID?\n\n117\n00:06:36.344 --> 00:06:41.069\nSo that's got to be 65, and then if we use\nDaniel's method, the next network is what?\n\n118\n00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:41.759\n&gt;&gt; 128.\n\n119\n00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.570\n&gt;&gt; 128, so that would be 192.168.10,\n\n120\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.012\n127 is the broadcast,\nwhich means that this should be.\n\n121\n00:06:50.012 --> 00:06:50.791\n&gt;&gt; 126.\n\n122\n00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.794\n&gt;&gt; 126, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:52.794 --> 00:06:55.863\nSo Daniel,\nlet's say that we something like this.\n\n124\n00:06:55.863 --> 00:06:58.363\nWhere we're taking a look\nat question that says,\n\n125\n00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:00.934\nwhich of the following two\nare in the same network?\n\n126\n00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:06.750\nWell, to me, if I don't know about this,\nI might think that 192.168.10.66 and\n\n127\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.183\n192.168.10.61 are in the same network.\n\n128\n00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:12.313\nIf I'm not paying attention, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:12.313 --> 00:07:16.220\nSo the way that you can determine that,\nof course, is by doing this and\n\n130\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.292\ntrying to do that.\n\n131\n00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:20.816\nNow you can use, of course, the binary\nanding to help you out if you need to, and\n\n132\n00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:22.935\njust that last octet,\nwhich is what I would do-\n\n133\n00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:23.621\n&gt;&gt; Super fast, yep.\n\n134\n00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.184\n&gt;&gt; If I'm not\n\n135\n00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:26.264\nsure that that's the way to go, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:26.264 --> 00:07:30.304\nSo hopefully you're able to see how\nall of this is actually working.\n\n137\n00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:35.137\nSo a couple of different methods there,\nand you can kind of follow along and\n\n138\n00:07:35.137 --> 00:07:37.913\nsee what this happens to be as well, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:42.034\nSo let's make sure that we do see the rest\nof this, because it's going to happen,\n\n140\n00:07:42.034 --> 00:07:43.791\nall right, so one more time here.\n\n141\n00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.596\nSo Daniel,\n\n142\n00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.569\nlet's test our ability again here.\n&gt;&gt; Let's push our luck?\n\n143\n00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:50.564\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and finish this\n\n144\n00:07:50.564 --> 00:07:56.866\nout so that we have a good, solid example\nbefore we start to fall apart here, okay?\n\n145\n00:07:56.866 --> 00:08:03.227\nAll right, so now my network ID I\nalready did network ID, okay.\n\n146\n00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:07.700\nSo network ID is up here,\nwhich I can't spell, network ID.\n\n147\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.414\nAnd now the broadcast of this one,\nDaniel's gonna use his method\n\n148\n00:08:12.414 --> 00:08:16.971\nwhich is gonna be, what?\n&gt;&gt; It'll be 191 will be the broadcast and\n\n149\n00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:21.010\nthen 190 will be the last usable IP.\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.090\nSo this one would be 191.\n\n151\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.840\nSo notice I'm not even doing\nthe binary anymore, right?\n\n152\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.995\nCuz Daniel's actually told\nme what the broadcast is.\n\n153\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.939\nAnd now for the range,\nDaniel's already determined,\n\n154\n00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:38.511\nit's really, what,\none above the network ID.\n\n155\n00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:45.145\nSo 192.168.10.129 192,\n\n156\n00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:50.957\noop, 192 168 10.190, okay.\n\n157\n00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.452\nAnd so\nthis one will also be our range here.\n\n158\n00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:59.103\nAll right, so a couple of different\nmethods overall if you actually\n\n159\n00:08:59.103 --> 00:09:03.910\nwant to make sure that you can get\nahold and get an understanding.\n\n160\n00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.070\nAnd practicing this as well, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.360\nNow Daniel, the other thing\nI also want to point out is\n\n162\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.200\nthat as you start to do this more often,\nokay?\n\n163\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.850\nYou're gonna also learn something about\nthe way that we divide in binary.\n\n164\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.510\nIs that, you don't have to worry\nabout things like remainders too\n\n165\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.130\nmuch, okay?\n&gt;&gt; You just have to follow those\n\n166\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.970\nplace values.\n\n167\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.230\nAnd you'll see that this\nis what will happen.\n\n168\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.791\nSo Daniel, let's take a look at\nthis just for a moment here, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:32.866\nWhen we started to take a look at the\nbinary and stuff like this, we're noticing\n\n170\n00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:38.230\nthat part of this actually does go into\nwell like the table that we memorized.\n\n171\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.611\nAnd we started adding up\nin smaller chunks here too.\n\n172\n00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:46.860\nSo like this, 192 is actually what,\nthe first two values in that table.\n\n173\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.742\nSo if you can determine this pattern,\n\n174\n00:09:49.742 --> 00:09:55.250\nnotice that when we divided into four,\nyou can see an interval, right?\n\n175\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.450\n0,64.\n\n176\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.600\n64 up from that as well, 128.\n\n177\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.020\n64 up from that is gonna be 192, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.720\nSo this is something that can begin\nto show you patterns as well.\n\n179\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.990\nAnd the more of these that\nyou practice on your own,\n\n180\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.450\nthe better it's going to be, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.405\nSo my recommendation as you start\nto begin to practice this, right?\n\n182\n00:10:19.405 --> 00:10:26.280\nIs to try and do exactly this slowly so\nthat you understand what is happening.\n\n183\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.160\nAnd then the method that Daniel told you,\n\n184\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.050\nonce you start seeing that,\nit becomes all you see, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.820\nWhich is kind of the key here.\n\n186\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.620\nBut, if all the tips and\n\n187\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.600\ntricks kind of fall apart, it's not gonna\nactually hurt you any longer, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.240\nSo it really does help out.\n\n189\n00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:48.390\nAll right, so Daniel, let's go ahead and\njust do this one more time here, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.390\nNow we're not gonna do every\nsingle one of them, but\n\n191\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.980\nlet's see if we can see another pattern,\nokay?\n\n192\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.870\nSo this time, Daniel,\n\n193\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:00.380\nwhat I want to do is I want to have eight\nnetworks out of this number instead, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.740\nSo if we start to do this 192.168.10.0\nhere which I've already determined, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.950\nAnd now I need eight networks.\n\n196\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.898\nSo this is good, we're having problems.\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna mess you up if\n\n197\n00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:12.608\nthere's no 1 in the 168.\n\n198\n00:11:12.608 --> 00:11:14.903\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it would mess me up.\n\n199\n00:11:14.903 --> 00:11:16.963\n&gt;&gt; Don't wanna confuse people.\n\n200\n00:11:16.963 --> 00:11:17.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Knowing myself,\n\n201\n00:11:17.797 --> 00:11:19.692\nI would absolutely 100%-\n&gt;&gt; Like where'd this\n\n202\n00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:20.890\n68 network come from?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n203\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.520\nSo let's say we need networks here,\neight, okay,\n\n204\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.870\nout of that one particular network,\nokay, is where we're gonna need it.\n\n205\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:35.064\nSo at this point,\nlet's just take our regular old network\n\n206\n00:11:35.064 --> 00:11:39.519\nthat we started off with here,\nwhich is this one.\n\n207\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.802\nPaste that down here so that we can see,\n\n208\n00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:53.570\nSee the numbers so\nthat we can work it out.\n\n209\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.310\nAnd then we'll do the subnet mask as well.\n\n210\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.056\nWe'll try and\ndetermine the new subnet mask too.\n\n211\n00:12:06.232 --> 00:12:10.659\nAll right, so if we start off with just\na class C, and now I'm actually going for\n\n212\n00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:12.540\neight networks, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.870\nSo Daniel, with four possibilities,\nor four networks I knew,\n\n214\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.970\ni borrowed two bits.\n&gt;&gt; Two\n\n215\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.130\nbits.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n216\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.000\nSo, how many would I need for\n\n217\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.093\neight networks?\n&gt;&gt; 12 bits.\n\n218\n00:12:21.093 --> 00:12:22.967\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 12 whole bits out of 8 bits that\n\n219\n00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:23.611\nare possible.\n\n220\n00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:24.652\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah\n\n221\n00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:27.553\nit's free is what it comes down too.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:27.553 --> 00:12:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Now if you're still not sure about\n\n223\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.927\nthe idea of why the heck did I pick three.\n&gt;&gt; Right, just do the math, right?\n\n224\n00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:35.196\n&gt;&gt; Just do the math, just go ahead and\n\n225\n00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:40.520\ncome up with every possible combination of\nthree bits that you can come up with and\n\n226\n00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.045\nnot repeating them, at least I hope.\n\n227\n00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.460\nLet's see what did I miss here?\n&gt;&gt; One,\n\n228\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.300\none, o.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you see it.\n\n229\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.570\nYou're good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.040\n&gt;&gt; You're awesome.\n\n231\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.660\nSo notice that, there it is, those\nare the eight possible combinations, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.074\nSo then you just substitute\nthe as you go through here.\n\n233\n00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:06.670\nSo let's go ahead and\nI'm gonna do it quicker.\n\n234\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.580\nAt least I think I am.\n\n235\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.580\nI'm gonna copy this eight times.\n&gt;&gt; And really Ronnie,\n\n236\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.850\nit's just exponentiality, right?\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n237\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.737\n&gt;&gt; If 1 bit is gonna give you 2,\n\n238\n00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:16.935\nthen 2 bits will give you 4.\n\n239\n00:13:16.935 --> 00:13:19.034\n3 bits will give you 8, and\nso on and so forth right?\n\n240\n00:13:19.034 --> 00:13:21.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's see here.\n\n241\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.800\nI'm not gonna do all of them,\n\n242\n00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.328\nbut we'll do,\nI don't know how many I did right, okay.\n\n243\n00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:31.910\nBut I wanna see if we can spot\nthe pattern of this one, okay.\n\n244\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.670\nSo now if I go back here and\nI now say, hey look,\n\n245\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.880\nthat means I need a new subnet mask.\n\n246\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.450\nSo we'll actually have a new subnet mask.\n\n247\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.010\nSo that's gonna be 255.255.\n\n248\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.813\nAnd now, Daniel, 123,\n\n249\n00:13:45.813 --> 00:13:50.092\nthat's 128 + 64 192,\n\n250\n00:13:50.092 --> 00:13:54.535\n192 + 32 is 224, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:56.285\nThat's gonna be my new subnet mask at\n\n252\n00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:57.660\nthat point.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n253\n00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.261\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n254\n00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:02.869\nnow remember that I can now\nstart changing these bits or\n\n255\n00:14:02.869 --> 00:14:07.692\nthe way that we were looking\nat them a little bit earlier.\n\n256\n00:14:07.692 --> 00:14:11.170\nSo I can just go back through here.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And we're just grabbing it\n\n257\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.032\nfrom our little table there.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n258\n00:14:13.032 --> 00:14:13.637\n&gt;&gt; Slide it in there.\n\n259\n00:14:13.637 --> 00:14:14.380\n&gt;&gt; That's all I'm doing.\n\n260\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.230\nIt's grabbing it from that table.\n\n261\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.066\nAnd hopefully, I can remember the one\nthat Daniel told me to to remember.\n\n262\n00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:21.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:23.010\n&gt;&gt; There are some things that\n\n264\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.860\nRonnie forgets very easily.\n\n265\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.930\nTyping is, of course, number one.\n\n266\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.426\nNumber two is math.\n&gt;&gt; Is pretty much what happens here.\n\n267\n00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:36.570\nAnd so now we do that, and of course-\n&gt;&gt; You're just duplicated\n\n268\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.340\nthe one above it.\n\n269\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:37.970\n&gt;&gt; Did I?\n\n270\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n271\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.770\nYou spot that stuff-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'll go through and\n\n273\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.819\ngo, that's not right.\n\n274\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.490\nAnd once again, we just change that, okay?\n\n275\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.460\nIt's key that you start doing this slowly,\nand\n\n276\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.390\nI do recommend that you do this every time\nuntil you go, I can see this in my brain.\n\n277\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.920\nAnd I mean it, that's what you want to do,\nonce you start to get to this point.\n\n278\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.300\nSo notice that we're not\nreally manipulating a ton,\n\n279\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.670\nwe're only changing what we need\nhere to help us to match that up.\n\n280\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.160\nAnd once we do that oops, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You can do it Ronnie.\n\n281\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.880\n&gt;&gt; I can do it, it's possible.\n\n282\n00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.882\nSo now we just go back through,\n\n283\n00:15:19.882 --> 00:15:23.210\nwell that first one is exactly\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n284\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:30.510\nBut the second one though now is I\nrealized that that's gonna be a 32, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.750\nNow Daniel, once I start with that, okay?\n\n286\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.794\nOnce I go all right, that first one is 32.\n\n287\n00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:37.421\nI might go ahead and\n\n288\n00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:40.680\nconfirm that the next one is 64.\n&gt;&gt; 64,\n\n289\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.280\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; But once I do that, and\n\n290\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.920\nI start realizing that that interval is,\n\n291\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.500\nit's gonna remain the same\nbecause that's all I'm doing.\n\n292\n00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.959\nIs now I start to realize that I\ndon't even need to go ahead and\n\n293\n00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:57.195\ndo every single conversion\nat this point And\n\n294\n00:15:57.195 --> 00:16:01.415\nyou keep adding 32 to the number of-\n&gt;&gt; I just keep adding 32.\n\n295\n00:16:01.415 --> 00:16:02.243\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.640\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.510\nThen of course we can use Daniel's method\nto determine broadcast numbers, right?\n\n298\n00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.420\nSo Daniel, let's say here, broadcast.\n\n299\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.380\nBroadcast, all right, so for this one.\n\n300\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.350\nThat should be what?\n\n301\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.768\nNow that I know the network number here.\n&gt;&gt; It should be a 31.\n\n302\n00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:30.688\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so 192.168.10.31.\n\n303\n00:16:37.782 --> 00:16:40.962\nAnd the next one will be 63.\n\n304\n00:16:40.962 --> 00:16:44.798\nI looked right at the number and\nof course I type that exactly in, right?\n\n305\n00:16:44.798 --> 00:16:49.410\nAnd then this one here should be 95.\n\n306\n00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:56.875\nAnd this one should be 159.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n307\n00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:57.538\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n308\n00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:58.933\n&gt;&gt; No, 127.\n\n309\n00:16:58.933 --> 00:16:59.851\n&gt;&gt; 127, sorry.\n\n310\n00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:00.356\n&gt;&gt; You skipped one.\n\n311\n00:17:00.356 --> 00:17:00.887\n&gt;&gt; I skipped one.\n\n312\n00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:02.524\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's eyes glazed down.\n\n313\n00:17:02.524 --> 00:17:03.732\n&gt;&gt; It's true, I did,\n\n314\n00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:05.058\nI really did.\n&gt;&gt; You're jumping on us.\n\n315\n00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:08.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 159, and\n\n316\n00:17:08.738 --> 00:17:12.881\nhere we go, 191.\n\n317\n00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:17.456\nAnd then 223.\n\n318\n00:17:17.456 --> 00:17:22.238\nNow the other thing that we didn't talk\nabout, Daniel, is this last one here.\n\n319\n00:17:22.238 --> 00:17:22.943\n&gt;&gt; Didn't take that 31 out of there,\n\n320\n00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:25.791\nbrother.\n&gt;&gt; What happened, did I, idiot, that's me.\n\n321\n00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:29.497\nI tell you, they shouldn't let\nthis guy actually be on the show.\n\n322\n00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:30.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie,\n\n323\n00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:33.545\nwe should just hire you a dedicated\ntypist, and you can just dictate.\n\n324\n00:17:33.545 --> 00:17:34.425\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n325\n00:17:34.425 --> 00:17:35.330\ntrue.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Daniel,\n\n327\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.041\nnotice this last one though.\n\n328\n00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:42.193\nOkay, this one, okay, 224 plus 32 though.\n\n329\n00:17:42.193 --> 00:17:47.710\nWait, that can't be right.\n&gt;&gt; Hold on,\n\n330\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.820\nwhat?\n&gt;&gt; So in other words, they're saying, hey,\n\n331\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.000\nwhat about the next one?\n\n332\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.520\nIf we were to go, we don't have\nto cuz we only had eight numbers.\n\n333\n00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.993\nBut it's saying that\nthat should be 256 right,\n\n334\n00:17:55.993 --> 00:17:56.814\nin theory.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n335\n00:17:56.814 --> 00:17:57.446\nin theory.\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n336\n00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.420\nthat's not the way that binary works,\nwe don't just keep adding numbers.\n\n337\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.930\nWhat happens is, once we get to that,\n\n338\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:08.770\nit actually changes to the next network,\nwhich is up here.\n\n339\n00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.406\nSo the great thing is we only chose 8,\nbut if we wanted to go the 9th one,\n\n340\n00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:15.825\nas you hit the end and you go wait,\n32 more, that would give me 2.\n\n341\n00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:18.698\nI can't use that number cuz\nthat's actually 9 bits,\n\n342\n00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:23.008\nwell when you switch over to that next bit\nup, and you turn that into a 1 in binary,\n\n343\n00:18:23.008 --> 00:18:24.977\nthat becomes an 11.\n&gt;&gt; It does do that.\n\n344\n00:18:24.977 --> 00:18:26.280\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens.\n\n345\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.233\nSo that's the way that that works.\n\n346\n00:18:27.233 --> 00:18:29.700\nSo it can throw you off a little bit.\n\n347\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.550\nBut just kind of realize\nthat you can see stuff.\n\n348\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.393\nSo I'm hoping that you're able to see\nthis pattern of things that's going on.\n\n349\n00:18:35.393 --> 00:18:39.680\nBut the key is absolutely 100% practice,\nright.\n\n350\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.340\nSo don't just stick to the four numbers,\ndo something else and start seeing this.\n\n351\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.190\nRemember those network ranges, make sure\nyou can determine the broadcast ID and\n\n352\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.650\nthe network ID.\n\n353\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.860\nAll that stuff is gonna be 100%\nimportant for the exam as well, okay.\n\n354\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.890\nAnd in class C, this is kind of\nwhat you have to get used to.\n\n355\n00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.000\nNow, I've got to let them in finally.\n\n356\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.500\nOkay, and this is why we actually have\nto think about getting faster, right?\n\n357\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.625\nAt some point in the series so far I\nmentioned that the goal is fairly simple,\n\n358\n00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:15.182\neverything that we go over is\nabout a minute per question, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:15.182 --> 00:19:17.464\nAnd that's not saying,\na minute per question,\n\n360\n00:19:17.464 --> 00:19:19.754\nI can get to go back through\nthe ones I want again.\n\n361\n00:19:19.754 --> 00:19:24.880\nNo, you have to be confident in\nyour answer as you go through.\n\n362\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.240\nI would try and\ntrain myself to a minute per question.\n\n363\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.370\nThere will be some questions that\nwill have multiple parts which\n\n364\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.980\nmeans you can take multiple minutes.\n\n365\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.840\nBut that will scare you, I guarantee you,\nthat one will kind of scare you.\n\n366\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.464\nBut try and\n\n367\n00:19:36.464 --> 00:19:40.810\ndo as much of the simple things as\nyou can in a minute per question.\n\n368\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.040\nRonnie, what about subnetting?\n\n369\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.002\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:19:43.002 --> 00:19:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll have a minute per question.\n\n371\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.850\n&gt;&gt; If you say Cisco exam,\n\n372\n00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.205\nwhat about x minute per question.\n\n373\n00:19:49.205 --> 00:19:50.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah I think that\n\n374\n00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.430\nthat's a good mark to actually hit.\n\n375\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.840\nSo in that way, right,\n\n376\n00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.020\nthere's two things that will prepare\nyou especially for this, right?\n\n377\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.906\nPractice is key.\n\n378\n00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:02.591\nBinary, binary, binary,\nthink about those numbers between 0 and\n\n379\n00:20:02.591 --> 00:20:06.726\n255 and then go, all right,\nlet me write out the binary.\n\n380\n00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:10.021\nOr write down just a random string\nof numbers between 0 and 255.\n\n381\n00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:11.830\nCome up with the binary for it.\n\n382\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.000\nCheck every single one.\n\n383\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.170\nAnd if you get them wrong, make sure\nyou go, why did I get that one wrong?\n\n384\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.502\nGo back through,\nhave a pattern to do that.\n\n385\n00:20:17.502 --> 00:20:20.966\nIn the subnetting,\nit's exactly like what we showed you here.\n\n386\n00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:25.527\nIf you start slow, Daniel showed you that\nas soon as he started seeing the pattern,\n\n387\n00:20:25.527 --> 00:20:27.530\nhe's like, ha, let me see.\n\n388\n00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.030\nWell try again with another number,\nstart slow and then go, wait a minute,\n\n389\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.590\nthere's patterns, and just see if you\ncan continue to see that pattern.\n\n390\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.470\nSo once you start to get to that point,\n\n391\n00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.980\nyou will begin to do this stuff\nin your head, which is strange.\n\n392\n00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.591\nIt really is, all of a sudden\nyou're looking at it like, yeah,\n\n393\n00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:45.864\nthat would be this subnet mask.\n\n394\n00:20:45.864 --> 00:20:47.035\nAnd that means that many numbers.\n\n395\n00:20:47.035 --> 00:20:51.259\nAnd the hard part is once you get to\nthose higher numbers and those lower,\n\n396\n00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:53.700\nthat's when it starts to get ya.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n397\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.742\nthe math is a little more difficult.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's-\n\n398\n00:20:55.742 --> 00:20:56.333\n&gt;&gt; You'll get there,\n\n399\n00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:59.014\ncuz you're just do it so much.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so later on, once we get\n\n400\n00:20:59.014 --> 00:21:02.051\nthrough the class B subnetting.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go back and\n\n401\n00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:05.348\nwe'll show you some of the other things\nthat you can do to get faster at this and\n\n402\n00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.847\nto get more prepared for the exam.\n\n403\n00:21:06.847 --> 00:21:10.340\nBut here it is, Class C subnetting.\n\n404\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.160\nHopefully that's enough for\nyou to practice and for\n\n405\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.630\nyou to get started in doing this.\n\n406\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.970\nJust remember, change what you need to.\n\n407\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.250\nAnd then make sure you determine\neverything else that we told you.\n\n408\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.270\nThe new subnet mask, the range,\n\n409\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.910\nthe broadcast ID, as well as of\ncourse the network ID itself.\n\n410\n00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.885\nBe able to determine whether or\nnot two machines are on the same network,\n\n411\n00:21:28.885 --> 00:21:33.440\nbecause with now breaking those rules,\nyou don't know okay?\n\n412\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.600\nSo be aware of that, and we've still\ngotta talk about a few more things,\n\n413\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.556\nbut that will be for\nanother complete episode.\n\n414\n00:21:39.556 --> 00:21:41.962\nWe'll kinda end this little\nmini-series at this point and\n\n415\n00:21:41.962 --> 00:21:44.860\nthen we'll dive into class B subnetting\nis what will end up happening.\n\n416\n00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is our sincere hope that if\n\n417\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.010\nyou were a little timid a little\npulled back from subnetting.\n\n418\n00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.520\nYou thought man that's a big scary\nmonster, that it's not so much that\n\n419\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.200\nanymore for you, that you actually\ngo okay, I see what's going on here.\n\n420\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.720\nYou know a couple of things and\na couple of rules.\n\n421\n00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.720\nAnd bada bing, you look for these patterns\nand everything starts to open up for you.\n\n422\n00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.650\nSo that is our definitely sincere wish,\nas I said.\n\n423\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.630\nRonnie, I think you did a fantastic job.\n\n424\n00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.970\nI've taught subnetting,\nI've seen you teach subnetting.\n\n425\n00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.750\nEverybody's got their own kinda style and\n\n426\n00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.190\nit's just as much of\nan art as it is a science.\n\n427\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.200\nAnd find a way that works for you.\n\n428\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.605\nRonnie's method is phenomenal,\nit is very good.\n\n429\n00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:22.880\nIt will help you prepare for\n\n430\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.290\njumping into those tricks that\nwill make them quicker, all right.\n\n431\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.620\nSo that's why we like\nto start this way and\n\n432\n00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.760\nthen move into the speeding\nup kind of stuff.\n\n433\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.150\nRonnie, again, great job today.\n\n434\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.540\nAppreciate you coming by.\n\n435\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.388\nI do also appreciate you good\nfolks out there for watching.\n\n436\n00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:39.088\nBut, as we like to say,\nwe have come to those portions, and\n\n437\n00:22:39.088 --> 00:22:41.842\nnow it's proceedings where it is time for\nus to call it a day.\n\n438\n00:22:41.842 --> 00:22:43.650\nThat's what we're going to do right now.\n\n439\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.540\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n440\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.715\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n441\n00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:47.609\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n442\n00:22:47.609 --> 00:22:48.509\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n443\n00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:56.048\n[MUSIC]\n\n444\n00:22:56.048 --> 00:22:58.897\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:13.892\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:16.600\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.098\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:21.310\nin today's episode we're back\nwith more on our CCENT series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.830\nJoining us in the studio, remember,\nhe is the subnetting master,\n\n8\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.310\nwe will learn from him,\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.230\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n10\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.092\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Daniel,\n\n11\n00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.590\nthank you for\nhaving me back on the show as we\n\n12\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.720\ncontinue on learning more of\ncourse about network fundamentals.\n\n13\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.280\nAnd one of these fundamental concepts that\nyou start to get really deep dive into of\n\n14\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.150\ncourse in the realm of Cisco,\nis going to be the concept of subnetting.\n\n15\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.210\nNow, if you've gone through other\ncertification training you've probably\n\n16\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.620\nseen this before inside\nof like CompTIA network\n\n17\n00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.510\nplus where you get a good\ndose over there too.\n\n18\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.640\nBut, in Cisco LAN,\nas you start to do this,\n\n19\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.420\nit's not so much about knowing\nevery step in the process.\n\n20\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.826\nEven though we take it step by step.\n\n21\n00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:06.739\nBut it's about making sure that\nyou have the fundamentals and\n\n22\n00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:10.170\nyou understand how it actually works,\nand then you get fast at doing it.\n\n23\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530\nAnd that is a key example for\nus and what you have to do.\n\n24\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.860\nAnd everything that you do for\n\n25\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.910\nCisco certifications, the idea is fairly\nquick, it is relatively adapt, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.510\nThat you have to be incredibly quick,\nand the answers that you give, and\n\n27\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.070\nyou don't get a second chance.\n\n28\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.590\nSo that's why a lot of people will start\nto find it super challenging, because it's\n\n29\n00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.620\ntimed and you have to be quick and\nyou have to be accurate at the same time.\n\n30\n00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.550\nBut all that is actually kind of a key for\nwhat we are doing.\n\n31\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.670\nSo we have already gone through in\nprevious episodes, and actually several\n\n32\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.150\nepisodes, where we talk about just\nthe basic concepts of Class C subnetting.\n\n33\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.260\nAnd we showed some binary conversions and\n\n34\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.315\nwe showed some different\nthings that were going on.\n\n35\n00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:53.940\nAnd hopefully, at this point, you\nare already practicing Class C subnetting.\n\n36\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.653\nNow, if you're watching this like one\nafter another, and you go, Ronnie,\n\n37\n00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:00.870\nI haven't taken time to stop and\npractice any subnetting and all.\n\n38\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.248\nWell, that's gonna make today's\nepisode much more difficult for\n\n39\n00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:05.932\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n40\n00:02:05.932 --> 00:02:09.600\nare we gonna practice subnetting today?\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna practice subnetting again\n\n41\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.740\nBut this time we are moving into\nthe realm of Class B subnetting.\n\n42\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.260\nNow, you might go okay, Class C subbing,\nand once we start there, it makes sense.\n\n43\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.040\nOnce people get to, and I know this is\ngonna sound like a large number, once they\n\n44\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.670\ndo like 50 or 60 subnets and they start\npracticing these things, It starts to\n\n45\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.080\nmake sense, there's a pattern that they go\nthrough and then they correct the pattern.\n\n46\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.720\nAnd once they get to 50 or\n60 of them, it actually makes sense.\n\n47\n00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.390\nThey may not do it very quickly, but\nthen it starts to make sense and\n\n48\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.270\nyou get the fundamentals down,\nyou're fine.\n\n49\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.580\nAnd then somebody says all right,\nlet's do a Class B subnet.\n\n50\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.030\nAnd now you start doing Class B subnet,\nand you get confused a little bit.\n\n51\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.740\nNow it's actually the process,\nDaniel, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.610\nIn Class B subnetting and\nin Class C subnetting, okay, you and\n\n53\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.540\nI know it's identical okay.\n\n54\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.060\nThe process itself is identical.\n\n55\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.120\nBut the results are amazingly different.\n\n56\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.270\nAnd that's where people get thrown off.\n\n57\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.790\nBecause you are going to see some\nof the same numbers that you saw,\n\n58\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.950\nif you've already have been\npracticing subnetting.\n\n59\n00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.745\nWe started pointing out,\nlike in the last episode or so,\n\n60\n00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:18.148\nI believe in the Class C\nsubnetting series here.\n\n61\n00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:22.009\nWhere we said look, hopefully you're\nstarting to see like patterns develop.\n\n62\n00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.187\nAnd the more that you do this you start\nseeing those patters and, wham, you go,\n\n63\n00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:26.860\nman I see patterns everywhere.\n\n64\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.660\nThen you get to Class B and like,\nthose patterns should be here,\n\n65\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.690\nbut I'm just not seeing\nthem in the same way.\n\n66\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.440\nBecause of what happens and\nthe differences there.\n\n67\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.650\nSo let me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about, and\n\n68\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.280\nthen let's do an example of a Class B\nsubnet and show you what we do, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.460\nSo, let's take a look at regular\nClass C subnetting here.\n\n70\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.572\nNow, I've done something\na little bit strange, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:51.598\nIs that I've taken different networks to\nkind of show what happens when we just\n\n72\n00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.790\nbegin with a simple subnet, right?\n\n73\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.300\nSo, I did 1, 9, 2, 1, 6, 9, 10.0 and\nlet's say that this is a regular slash 24.\n\n74\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.980\nA single network, 254 hosts.\n\n75\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.950\nBut, I can take that network, if I wanted\nto, and divide into two separate networks.\n\n76\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.180\nIf I do that, notice that, that 254\nends up getting kind of divided up.\n\n77\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.400\nAnd you get, well, 2 networks.\n\n78\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.170\nThen you divide that in half,\nyou get 126 hosts per network.\n\n79\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.410\nMakes sense, right?\n\n80\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.980\nSame thing as you come through here and\nyou actually go, hey,\n\n81\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.630\nI need to actually get\nthis new subnet mask here.\n\n82\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.370\nAnd now I can break it into 4 networks.\n\n83\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.330\nAnd notice the host number's smaller as\nit continues to go down through here.\n\n84\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.820\nAnd what you'll start to notice as you do,\nlike I said probably 50 or 60 of them.\n\n85\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.760\nYou're gonna go man, I see these patterns.\n\n86\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.825\nI see these numbers.\n\n87\n00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:42.445\nIt's starting to make sense.\n\n88\n00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:45.880\nThat I'm not gonna have networks that\nare actually any different than this.\n\n89\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.510\nThey're always gonna be those numbers.\n\n90\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.270\nAnd that's because binary\nalways follows what?\n\n91\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.527\nThose place values.\n\n92\n00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:54.996\nSo I don't come up with 63.7.\n\n93\n00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:58.531\nI don't come up with 59.993,\n\n94\n00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.268\nanything like that.\n&gt;&gt; There will be no points in thise,\n\n95\n00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:05.040\nother than the dotted decimal points.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no points,\n\n96\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.575\nno remainders, it's just what it is.\n\n97\n00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:10.665\nSo you'll start seeing those\npatterns actually appear for us.\n\n98\n00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:12.575\nSo, Daniel, that makes sense, right?\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n99\n00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:13.665\n&gt;&gt; Once you start seeing it,\n\n100\n00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:18.535\nyou'll start seeing it as you start\nto divide up more of those host bits,\n\n101\n00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:19.715\nit happens.\n\n102\n00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:21.025\nSo of course then,\n\n103\n00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:26.320\nthe more of the host bits that I take\nup over here, all the way down to 252.\n\n104\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.160\nThe more networks I can squeeze out,\nbecause I'm adding more\n\n105\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.660\nbits to the network portion which\nleave less bits for the host ID.\n\n106\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.820\nAll right, so Class B and\nwe'll show you how you get to this.\n\n107\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.710\nLet me show you an example of Class B now.\n\n108\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.180\nClass B, notice that the actual\nnumbers are pretty much the same.\n\n109\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.906\nThere it is.\n\n110\n00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:53.455\n128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n111\n00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:54.947\non and so forth.\n&gt;&gt; Looks the same.\n\n112\n00:05:54.947 --> 00:05:59.735\nYeah, it looks exactly the same,\nbut this time with the Class B,\n\n113\n00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:04.890\nnotice that we've kind of now actually\ntaken from the idea of Class B.\n\n114\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.750\nWhich actually means that\nthe default summit mask is what?\n\n115\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.369\n255.255.0.0.\n\n116\n00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.610\nAnd when we take a look at it,\nthat's the first two octets, right?\n\n117\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.750\nSo it means the first two octets, Daniel,\nin subnetting, I am not gonna touch.\n\n118\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.939\nSo whatever they give me as numbers,\nI don't care,\n\n119\n00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:22.755\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n120\n00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:28.290\n&gt;&gt; If they give me 190.253 Who cares?\n\n121\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n122\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Who cares, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.370\nBut that third octet, that's where Class B\nsubnetting begins, is in the third octet.\n\n124\n00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.240\nNow not only in the third octet though,\n\n125\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.720\nyou can now subnet the third and\nfourth octet.\n\n126\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.072\nSo you now have all of those bits\nthat you can actually subnet.\n\n127\n00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Maybe because with a Class B they would\n\n128\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.060\ngive you this massive amount of hosts,\nand you'd get even more with Class A.\n\n129\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.960\nBut that Class B,\nyou get all those thousands of hosts.\n\n130\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.429\nNow I got a whole lot to borrow from,\nlet me put it the right way.\n\n131\n00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:01.780\nI borrow those bits so\nthat I can create more subnets.\n\n132\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n133\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.150\nlet's remind ourselves of that.\n\n134\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.510\nSo the first 16 bits are gonna be\nour network ID, which means for\n\n135\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.340\nthe host portion, right, 2 to the 16th\npower, that's 65,536 possible hosts.\n\n136\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.350\nBut we have to subtract out 2, right?\n\n137\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.070\nOne for the network ID,\none for the broadcast ID.\n\n138\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.399\nSo that's why it's 65,534 all together.\n\n139\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.200\nNow once we take something like that and\nwe begin to subnet just that third octet.\n\n140\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.584\nYou can do that, but notice, Daniel,\n\n141\n00:07:34.584 --> 00:07:38.867\nthat I actually start coming down\nhere into the fourth octave as well.\n\n142\n00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:40.832\nAnd this is where it gets confusing,\nright?\n\n143\n00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:44.770\nIs that the numbers\nseem to start all over.\n\n144\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.910\nAnd now Daniel, beginning right\nhere where it says 512 networks\n\n145\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.701\nat this point, it now has 255.255.255.128.\n\n146\n00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:59.551\nWell that starts to look like\nClass C subnetting very easily.\n\n147\n00:07:59.551 --> 00:08:02.425\nWhen you start seeing\nthe Class C subnetting Now,\n\n148\n00:08:02.425 --> 00:08:05.585\nthat's where the brain starts\nplaying tricks on you.\n\n149\n00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:10.698\nSo what is the difference here between\nthat class C subnet mask that we saw,\n\n150\n00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.020\nright here?\n\n151\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.080\nOkay, notice this one, and\nthis one only gave us two networks, right?\n\n152\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.170\nAnd then,\nthe class B network here though, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.346\nNotice the difference here,\nit is now 512 networks instead.\n\n154\n00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:28.687\nAnd this is where you\nhave to pay attention,\n\n155\n00:08:28.687 --> 00:08:33.574\nbecause remember that what we're starting\noff from, right, is bit number 17, right?\n\n156\n00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:38.692\nThe first 16 we're not going to touch,\nbut bit number 17 going all the way\n\n157\n00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:45.050\nthrough 31, essentially, if we wanted to\n30, is where we were playing here, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.910\nWell those can actually end up getting\ndivided into different networks.\n\n159\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.530\nSo at this point,\n\n160\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.060\nthe big difference is notice the number of\nnetworks that we have right here, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.939\nSo whereas before,\nwe actually end up with two networks,\n\n162\n00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:02.803\nnow I end up with 512 networks instead.\n\n163\n00:09:02.803 --> 00:09:06.933\nNotice the same number of hosts, but\neach one of those networks then,\n\n164\n00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:09.672\n512 of them, can end up with 126 hosts.\n\n165\n00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:11.772\nAnd then the numbers begin to grow,\n\n166\n00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:16.440\nand you'll start seeing them double\nas they go on through here, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.720\nSo if you want to actually know\nthe resulting difference between class A,\n\n168\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.570\nor not class A, class C subnetting,\nwhich we see hundreds of hosts, right?\n\n169\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.226\nWe can subnet now where we actually\nare creating networks that\n\n170\n00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:34.172\nrequire hundreds if not thousands\nof possible hosts if we want to.\n\n171\n00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:37.859\nAnd then we can even create\nthousands of possible networks,\n\n172\n00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:40.833\neven with very few hosts\nin between if we need to.\n\n173\n00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:44.700\nBut the key is remembering that with\nclass B, the rest of this, right,\n\n174\n00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.970\nthese last two octets essentially,\nare the realms that we play in.\n\n175\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.550\nNow, if you go out on to the Internet, and\nyou start to read on class B subnetting,\n\n176\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.720\nsome people say you only\nstay in the third octet.\n\n177\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.590\nAnd generally, I'm going to admit this,\nin Cisco land,\n\n178\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.170\nthat's probably what will happen.\n\n179\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.400\nBut in reality, though, and actually even\nas you go further on into advanced Cisco\n\n180\n00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.500\nstudies, they're not\ngoing to stay in that.\n\n181\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.620\nThey are going to ask you for\nthings like point-to-point subnets and\n\n182\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.432\nnot waste addresses here.\n\n183\n00:10:13.432 --> 00:10:17.770\nWhich point-to-point subnets means I only\nneed two IP addresses in that network.\n\n184\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.050\nWell, what if I get a class B address?\n\n185\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.260\nI need to know how to subnet that, and\n\n186\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.830\nmake sure I actually put\nit in the right network.\n\n187\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.600\nAnd that's gonna be key for us.\n\n188\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.525\nSo even though the process\nof subnetting is the same,\n\n189\n00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:32.914\nthe results though Daniel,\nthat's what we're looking at.\n\n190\n00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:36.072\nIs now the results really\ndo become monumental.\n\n191\n00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:40.250\nBefore, at 120 like we said, it was really\ntwo networks, and then we went to four,\n\n192\n00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.330\nand the went eight, and you continued on.\n\n193\n00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.700\nBut at this point now,\n\n194\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.540\nlook at it, yeah, it grows.\n&gt;&gt; And it really goes into how we\n\n195\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.230\nwere talking before about\ndesigning your network, right?\n\n196\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.300\nDo I need a class,\ndo I need to be able to subnet a class B,\n\n197\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.200\ncreate a bunch of different networks, and\nhave a moderate amount of hosts on them.\n\n198\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.500\nOr do I need just a few networks with\na massive amount of hosts on it?\n\n199\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.800\nIt all comes into play\non how you're going to,\n\n200\n00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.050\neventually once you get into the design\nphase of doing Cisco or networking,\n\n201\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.980\nthis stuff is really gonna bring home\nthe bacon and be your money maker.\n\n202\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.260\nCuz it's these financial truths that help\nyou be able to answer those questions.\n\n203\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, so and\n\n204\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.940\nthen that's a great point to make Daniel,\nbecause most of the time, like I said,\n\n205\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.410\nif you try to do this after three or\n\n206\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.070\nfour class C networks, and\nI'm gonna do a class B.\n\n207\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.880\nIt is,\nit's gonna play tricks on your mind, but\n\n208\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.020\nit's only your mind playing tricks.\n\n209\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.465\nCuz you're just seeing\nthe same numbers again.\n\n210\n00:11:29.465 --> 00:11:33.915\nLike wait a minute, I just did this\nwith class C, why are there only two\n\n211\n00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:38.607\nnetworks with a class C but\nthis number now gives me 1,024 networks?\n\n212\n00:11:38.607 --> 00:11:42.369\nI mean that does, I remember the first\ntime I encountered it, I was like,\n\n213\n00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.160\nwhy would it be so different?\n&gt;&gt; And it makes sense because if you're\n\n214\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.440\nonly looking at it in the context of-\n&gt;&gt; Class C.\n\n215\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.030\n&gt;&gt; That subnet mask and\n\n216\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.620\nyour class C subnetting ability,\nit's really gonna freak you out.\n\n217\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.210\nSo you have to be, you have to be really\nquick at looking at the question, or\n\n218\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.920\nif somebody's asking\na question about this,\n\n219\n00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.470\nand saying, you're talking about\na class B subnet, therefore x,y, and\n\n220\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.398\nz are gonna occur.\n&gt;&gt; Now the other caveat that I need to\n\n221\n00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:10.585\nthrough in here is that there's also a,\nI don't know about a misunderstanding\n\n222\n00:12:10.585 --> 00:12:14.349\nas much as, and I think it's from\nthe learning perspective, Daniel.\n\n223\n00:12:14.349 --> 00:12:17.037\nMost people say,\nwell class B subnetting actually means\n\n224\n00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:19.454\nthat you stay in the class\nB network range, right?\n\n225\n00:12:19.454 --> 00:12:24.247\nSo remember that that class B classical\nnetworking, right, begins at 128 and\n\n226\n00:12:24.247 --> 00:12:26.270\ngoing all the way through 191.\n\n227\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.180\nIf you do that you're saying,\nhey, those are the only networks.\n\n228\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.430\nOr those network numbers are the only ones\nthat can be class B subnetted, that's not\n\n229\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.590\ntrue, you can actually do class A with\na class B subnetting if you want to.\n\n230\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.120\nAnd that's where you'll\nnormally find it happening.\n\n231\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.500\nOnce you get to class A,\ncan you subnet that if you want to?\n\n232\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.250\nYes, you definitely can, but\n\n233\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.730\nnow you're talking about\nnetworks that are very massive.\n\n234\n00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.360\nMillions of hosts is what your\nactually beginning to talk about.\n\n235\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.070\nSo usually you don't see a lot of that.\n\n236\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.620\nBut just kinda remember that class B\nsubnetting really can be opened up to\n\n237\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.390\nany of them if you want to.\n\n238\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.490\nBut we're just gonna use a class B at this\npoint since that's what we're familiar\n\n239\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.560\nwith to help us.\n\n240\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.400\nNow Daniel for us to get started in this,\nwe're gonna take this network right here.\n\n241\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.470\nThis 17780 with a slash 16, or\n\n242\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:15.050\nactually the 255.255.0.0,\nI haven't used the slash notation yet.\n\n243\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.940\nI'm kinda getting ahead of myself here.\n\n244\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.030\nWe're gonna take that network, and\nwe are going to divide it up into\n\n245\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.530\ndifferent networks here, okay,\nto give us what we actually need, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.650\nSo let's run through what we have\nthe ability to do right now from\n\n247\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.240\nwhat we learned about in class\nC that will help us out.\n\n248\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.240\nNow instead [LAUGH] you, Daniel,\nwatching me type again and mocking\n\n249\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.155\nevery single letter that I type in.\n&gt;&gt; Don't take my fun away,\n\n250\n00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.271\nRonnie [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n251\n00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:45.120\nI tried to lessen the pain\nis what I tried to do.\n\n252\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.080\nAnd the great thing is since you've\nalready gone through this several times,\n\n253\n00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.840\nand I mean it,\nby this point if you haven't, you are,\n\n254\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.770\nit's gonna play tricks on your mind.\n\n255\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.810\nSo do multiple practices of class C.\n\n256\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.890\nMake sure you get the concepts in mind and\nthen move onto this.\n\n257\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.610\nAnd if you go,\nI'm just gonna take it as it is.\n\n258\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.360\nThat's fine with me,\nit just becomes a little bit harder.\n\n259\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.350\nSo let's make sure that we understand,\nokay?\n\n260\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.712\nSo normally with the class B let's\ngo ahead and take a look here, so\n\n261\n00:14:09.712 --> 00:14:11.286\nthere's that 177.80.\n\n262\n00:14:11.286 --> 00:14:16.758\nAnd there it is,\nthe default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0.\n\n263\n00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:19.590\nSo here's the requirement that I'm given,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.730\nIf I just chose eight networks,\njust as a random idea of eight networks.\n\n265\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:30.460\nSo let's say what we might actually\nbe asked, okay, instead is, hey, now\n\n266\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.350\nhow many hosts am I gonna get per network\nat this particular point, if I do that?\n\n267\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.089\nSo, you can do something like that,\nwhere you go,\n\n268\n00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:42.103\nhow many hosts per network is that going\nto give me, if I take this number and\n\n269\n00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:44.935\nI try to subnet it to eight\ndifferent networks here?\n\n270\n00:14:44.935 --> 00:14:48.717\nOkay, so we're gonna determine how that\nactually ends up working for us so\n\n271\n00:14:48.717 --> 00:14:49.806\nthat we can see that.\n\n272\n00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:52.586\nBut before we do that we need\nto make sure that we understand\n\n273\n00:14:52.586 --> 00:14:54.820\nwhat our networks are going to be.\n\n274\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.600\nSo remember that when start doing this,\nright.\n\n275\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:04.600\nI've just gone ahead, and just to give us\nour fundamentals, is I took our IP address\n\n276\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.400\nand its subnet mask here, and\nthen did essentially binary anding for\n\n277\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.280\nthis so that we determine\nthe network portion of our address.\n\n278\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.390\nNow there was one thing that, it started\nbothering me as I was getting ready for\n\n279\n00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.840\nthis show and I realized something.\n\n280\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.130\nWe had talked about subnet masks,\n\n281\n00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.750\njust a little bit about it\nidentifying the bits here.\n\n282\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.540\nBut, or in the network portions.\n\n283\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.450\nBut I forgot to mention something which is\nfoundational in everything that we talk\n\n284\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.790\nabout subnet masks.\n\n285\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.300\nIs that a subject mask\nhas a particular pattern,\n\n286\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.143\nit's not the same as an IP address.\n\n287\n00:15:33.143 --> 00:15:37.991\nBut notice this continuous string of\nbinary ones from the left hand side,\n\n288\n00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:40.258\nor the other terminology here is,\n\n289\n00:15:40.258 --> 00:15:45.045\nfrom the most significant bit toward\nthe least significant bit, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:49.537\nSo that means from that left hand side\nthat you're seeing to the right here,\n\n291\n00:15:49.537 --> 00:15:52.390\nit's always a contiguous string of 1s.\n\n292\n00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:57.270\nIf you put a 0 in here, so Dan,\nif I put a 0 in here, that means what?\n\n293\n00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.679\nThat's not gonna be this subnet mask,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:00.394\nIn theory,\n\n295\n00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:03.134\nthe subnet mask would end right there.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n296\n00:16:03.134 --> 00:16:04.377\n&gt;&gt; That would be the contiguous\n\n297\n00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:05.056\nstring of 1s.\n\n298\n00:16:05.056 --> 00:16:07.449\nSo that would not work for us.\n\n299\n00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:11.117\nSo just a reminder, cuz this is\nsomething that I probably should have\n\n300\n00:16:11.117 --> 00:16:12.642\nsaid from day one.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:16:12.642 --> 00:16:13.686\n&gt;&gt; And then I started going back to my\n\n302\n00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:16.200\nnotes and I'm like, you know what,\nI don't think I actually said that at all.\n\n303\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.791\nSo I thought this is a great place for me\nto throw that in before we go any further.\n\n304\n00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:23.756\nCuz that could be, again, an easy question\non the exam where you're just kind\n\n305\n00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:26.658\nof given a subnet mask, and\nthen you're given numbers.\n\n306\n00:16:26.658 --> 00:16:30.950\nAnd you're like, that looks like a subnet\nmask, it begins with 255, yeah, sure,\n\n307\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.294\nthat's, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What the heck.\n\n308\n00:16:32.294 --> 00:16:34.514\n&gt;&gt; Yeah what the heck 255.248,\n\n309\n00:16:34.514 --> 00:16:35.910\nthat's fine.\n\n310\n00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.750\nIt can be, but it doesn't have to be.\n\n311\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.040\nSo just kind of be aware when you\nstart seeing stuff like this.\n\n312\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.020\nAll right, so now we have essentially\ndetermined from this subnet mask here,\n\n313\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.930\nright, and the binary ending.\n\n314\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.922\nThat the first 16 bits are going\nto be what, my network portion,\n\n315\n00:16:52.922 --> 00:16:55.071\nokay, so that makes sense.\n\n316\n00:16:55.071 --> 00:17:01.850\nSo Daniel, if we're doing IPv4, which we\nare, and this 32 bit address all together.\n\n317\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.740\nIf I'm taking away 16 bits from the\nnetwork portion, that has to mean what?\n\n318\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.860\nThose last 16 bits, or\n\n319\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.810\nthe second 16 bits, has to actually be\nthe number of hosts that I could have.\n\n320\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.985\nSo 2 to the 16th power on that point,\nright, you're saying,\n\n321\n00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:19.890\nwhere the heck does the number 2 come in,\nRonnie?\n\n322\n00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.401\n0 or 1, that´s our base number,\nthose are our two combinations.\n\n323\n00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:29.114\nWe raise that to the 16th power,\nthat´s what gives us the 65,536\n\n324\n00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:33.350\npossible combinations that\nwe can have them, all right.\n\n325\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.512\nSo now that we've determined that,\n\n326\n00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:41.640\nwe now need to begin to subnet\nthat particular address.\n\n327\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.400\nAnd the only way we do\nthat is by borrowing\n\n328\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.490\na number of bits from the host portion.\n\n329\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.370\nWe're not gonna touch, what,\nthose first 16 bits, right.\n\n330\n00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.930\nBecause that's our network,\nwe don't even care what those numbers are.\n\n331\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.770\nAnd I mean it, don't even worry\nabout what those numbers are.\n\n332\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.871\nFrom this point, if they ask you to\nsubnet, you're only gonna work from that\n\n333\n00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:06.458\nparticular third and fourth octet, the\nhost bit side, is what you're going to do.\n\n334\n00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:11.102\nSo Daniel,\nwhat I actually do is I need to actually,\n\n335\n00:18:11.102 --> 00:18:14.705\nnot host here, this should be network.\n\n336\n00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:19.259\nOkay, 8 networks require how many bits\nis what we want to actually think about\n\n337\n00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:20.660\nhere, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.660\nSo if you're not sure, the easiest\nway to actually do that, right,\n\n339\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.350\nis to start with what we learned\nabout in binary conversion, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.120\nSo if I start from the left-hand side,\nfrom the least significant bit,\n\n341\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.540\nthat's a 1.\n\n342\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.390\nAnd then the second bit is a 2,\nthat gives me, what is that, [LAUGH] 3\n\n343\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.290\nall together, and then 7,\nokay, cuz there's a 4.\n\n344\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.290\nNow, that actually is the place value 4,\nso Daniel, I get 7,\n\n345\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.780\nI don't know how I'd get 8 out of this.\n\n346\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.530\nI did not count, what, the number 0.\n\n347\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.520\nSo now, if I count in 0, and I take that,\n\n348\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.796\nnotice there's a 0,\nright, and then here's 1,\n\n349\n00:19:02.796 --> 00:19:08.482\nhere's binary 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, oops.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n350\n00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:10.746\nyou missed one.\n&gt;&gt; Seven, and I missed one somewhere,\n\n351\n00:19:10.746 --> 00:19:12.967\nwhich one did I miss.\n&gt;&gt; 100.\n\n352\n00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:13.872\n&gt;&gt; 100, see?\n\n353\n00:19:13.872 --> 00:19:14.511\n&gt;&gt; There it is,\n\n354\n00:19:14.511 --> 00:19:16.725\njust on the wrong side\nof the equation there.\n\n355\n00:19:16.725 --> 00:19:18.052\n&gt;&gt; Which one did I do.\n\n356\n00:19:18.052 --> 00:19:20.017\n&gt;&gt; 011.\n\n357\n00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:20.765\n&gt;&gt; 011.\n\n358\n00:19:20.765 --> 00:19:24.951\n&gt;&gt; 101, 110, 111, yeah, that's seven.\n\n359\n00:19:24.951 --> 00:19:26.359\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well I'm lying to you,\n\n360\n00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:29.220\nthat's seven, that doesn't make sense.\n&gt;&gt; No it doesn't.\n\n361\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.983\n&gt;&gt; No, and actually yeah, but\n\n362\n00:19:30.983 --> 00:19:35.010\nthat's, all right now,\nI'm taking a look at this again.\n\n363\n00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.956\nDaniel, I clearly see eight numbers there,\nbut\n\n364\n00:19:36.956 --> 00:19:39.700\nyou and I counted seven.\n&gt;&gt; I know, we are apparently having\n\n365\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.220\ntrouble with our counting abilities today.\n&gt;&gt; Stepping back from that, I see four\n\n366\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.099\nnumbers on this side, that's four numbers,\nand four numbers on this side, and\n\n367\n00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:51.950\nwe still counted seven, [LAUGH] go figure.\n&gt;&gt; Do not\n\n368\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.511\ntrust our ability to count simple numbers.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do that,\n\n369\n00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:57.660\nit's one of those synchronization things.\n&gt;&gt; Subnetting, we've got you covered,\n\n370\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.389\nactual counting, though-\n&gt;&gt; What I should have done, right,\n\n371\n00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:03.772\ninstead of counting with one, I probably\nshould have started with a zero zero,\n\n372\n00:20:03.772 --> 00:20:05.753\nand then went one, two,\nthree at that point.\n\n373\n00:20:05.753 --> 00:20:10.677\nBut that's what happens because I'm\njust making it up as I go along, Daniel,\n\n374\n00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:12.852\nthat's what it all comes down to.\n\n375\n00:20:12.852 --> 00:20:17.500\nSo there we go, it actually does\nrequire for us three bits here.\n\n376\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.160\nI'm gonna replace x here with three\nbits is what we're going to do.\n\n377\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.950\nSo now that I have those three bits,\nI am going to do what?\n\n378\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.060\nUp here, of course, it means I have\nto determine the new subnet mask.\n\n379\n00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.420\nSo if I do that, that means that that\nbecomes the network portion, right?\n\n380\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.217\nRemember that the subnet\nmask now changes for us,\n\n381\n00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:42.623\nand it has a contiguous string\nof 1s from the left hand side.\n\n382\n00:20:42.623 --> 00:20:46.524\nThat's why it was important [LAUGH] that\nI remembered to mention that finally,\n\n383\n00:20:46.524 --> 00:20:49.550\nafter six, seven episodes that\nI've been here doing this.\n\n384\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.880\nSo now I have a new subnet mask,\n255.255, and\n\n385\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:00.840\nthen this is 128 plus 64 which is 192,\nplus 32 which is 224.\n\n386\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.080\nSo I know that I can change this and\n\n387\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.418\nmake my new subnet mask right here.\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\n\n388\n00:21:07.418 --> 00:21:09.389\nI'm gonna point something out here,\n\n389\n00:21:09.389 --> 00:21:13.585\njust because I'm sure there's somebody\nout there going, hold on, Ronnimus.\n\n390\n00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:17.341\nWhen we were counting up these\nbits of which you speak,\n\n391\n00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:22.499\nyou went from the right to the left,\nand you said one, two, and you did it.\n\n392\n00:21:22.499 --> 00:21:25.443\nBut when you masked it off, you went from\nleft to right, and that could be confusing\n\n393\n00:21:25.443 --> 00:21:27.499\nif you haven't been initiated, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n394\n00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:31.491\nthat's why I had to emphasize that point\nthat I did right at the beginning.\n\n395\n00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:35.457\nIs that when you start to take a look\nat changing the subnet mask to give you\n\n396\n00:21:35.457 --> 00:21:37.018\nsomething for a new subnet,\n\n397\n00:21:37.018 --> 00:21:40.938\nyou have to actually ensure that\nit's a contiguous string of 1s here.\n\n398\n00:21:40.938 --> 00:21:46.615\nSo I'm just taking these three 1s and,\nI know this is the only way to do this.\n\n399\n00:21:46.615 --> 00:21:49.526\nDoesn't make it make sense,\nright, is in theory,\n\n400\n00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:52.781\nI'm really just moving the dot\nis what I'm doing, okay?\n\n401\n00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:56.237\nThat's essentially what ends up happening\nhere, is I'm moving that dot is\n\n402\n00:21:56.237 --> 00:21:58.537\nwhat happens, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n403\n00:21:58.537 --> 00:21:59.601\n&gt;&gt; So once we do that, and\n\n404\n00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:03.581\nnow you could go, all right, so there we\ngo, so now that's essentially the network\n\n405\n00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:06.540\nthat we're having, but\nwe still have to report it, though.\n\n406\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.930\nThe problem is,\nthe reason why we don't like doing that\n\n407\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.270\nis that we always report each octet,\nin eight.\n\n408\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.530\nSo this is why instead\nyou end up doing that.\n\n409\n00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.425\n&gt;&gt; And I just wanna,\n\n410\n00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:22.447\njust cuz I've been that guy on the other\nside going, I don't understand this.\n\n411\n00:22:22.447 --> 00:22:25.310\nI'm ready to pull my hair out and\nchomp off all my fingernails.\n\n412\n00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.090\nRemember, when we're counting\nup how many bits do we need,\n\n413\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.730\nthe place values above each one is\nwhat's important at this point.\n\n414\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.710\nI need to know how many to get x amount of\nnetworks, so I'm gonna count one, one and\n\n415\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.930\ntwo is three, two and three,\nright, and you get your numbers.\n\n416\n00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.378\nAnd when you add it, as Ronnie's been\nsaying, when you actually mask that off,\n\n417\n00:22:44.378 --> 00:22:47.580\nthose three bits,\nthey move to that contiguous line so\n\n418\n00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.140\nthat it works correctly.\n\n419\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.570\nAnd your systems know that subnet mask,\n\n420\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.190\nbecause they see\nthe contiguous bits of 1s.\n\n421\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.490\nSo that's why the little fire drill there,\nmoving around, so if you were confused,\n\n422\n00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.244\nhopefully that helps.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's a great point to make,\n\n423\n00:23:01.244 --> 00:23:03.630\nbecause that is something\nthat is very confusing.\n\n424\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.770\nWhether we begin with Class C or\nClass B, that becomes confusing.\n\n425\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.782\nAnd if you don't do enough of these,\n\n426\n00:23:09.782 --> 00:23:13.120\nit's gonna really become confusing\nbecause you'll forget after awhile.\n\n427\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.515\nAnd then you go, well,\nnow I've got three bits, what, how do I?\n\n428\n00:23:16.515 --> 00:23:19.929\nYeah, so make sure you practice this.\n&gt;&gt; And the masking, we're not calculating,\n\n429\n00:23:19.929 --> 00:23:20.990\nit's already been calculated.\n\n430\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.100\nWhen we're calculating,\n\n431\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.810\nall these place values actually\nmean something between the dots.\n\n432\n00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.990\nSo that should help you\nkeep things straight.\n\n433\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.560\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel,\n\n434\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.460\nnow that we've added that in,\nso now my network bits,\n\n435\n00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.496\nI'm gonna get this all backward here.\n\n436\n00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:40.488\nI have 8 bits here, 8 bits here,\nthat's 16, hopefully I\n\n437\n00:23:40.488 --> 00:23:45.421\ncan count this again, 17 18, 19 bits, okay\n&gt;&gt; I'll get my calculator [LAUGH].\n\n438\n00:23:45.421 --> 00:23:49.627\n&gt;&gt; And it's going to be my host ID\n\n439\n00:23:49.627 --> 00:23:52.158\nbits out of 32.\n\n440\n00:23:52.158 --> 00:23:58.328\nSo in theory then, right, I should\nbe able to take 32 and subtract 19.\n\n441\n00:23:58.328 --> 00:24:01.598\nAnd that should leave me with the number\nof possible host bits that I have.\n\n442\n00:24:01.598 --> 00:24:03.954\nSo if I do that [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; 13 [LAUGH]?\n\n443\n00:24:03.954 --> 00:24:06.236\n&gt;&gt; That should be 13, should be,\n\n444\n00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:08.485\nshould be.\n&gt;&gt; Operative words everyone.\n\n445\n00:24:08.485 --> 00:24:10.865\n&gt;&gt; Should be 13, and that's key,\n\n446\n00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:16.037\nbecause that now gives us this Possibility\nhere that, if I wanna determine\n\n447\n00:24:16.037 --> 00:24:21.570\nthis number so far, like right here,\nhow many host bits per network?\n\n448\n00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:26.449\nI can do that 2 to the 13th power,\nand then subtract out 2 for\n\n449\n00:24:26.449 --> 00:24:29.595\nthe NetworkID and for the BroadcastID.\n\n450\n00:24:29.595 --> 00:24:33.210\nAnd then I could come up with\nthe right answer at that point, okay?\n\n451\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.580\nSo just keep that in mind,\nlet's see if that works out.\n\n452\n00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.580\nSo this is how I started actually\nidentifying this in class B.\n\n453\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.550\nDaniel, when I started actually\ndoing class B networks,\n\n454\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.620\nI would be able to do all this.\n\n455\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.114\nAnd then I'd start\ncounting up the bits here.\n\n456\n00:24:47.114 --> 00:24:50.365\nAnd then I'd go, wait a minute, how am\nI getting different number of hosts per\n\n457\n00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:50.928\nnetwork?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:24:50.928 --> 00:24:51.482\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\n\n459\n00:24:51.482 --> 00:24:52.857\nthat can't be right.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense.\n\n460\n00:24:52.857 --> 00:24:54.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that doesn't make sense.\n\n461\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.029\nSo each one can help to validate\nwhether or not you have this right.\n\n462\n00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.869\n&gt;&gt; The math should line up.\n\n463\n00:24:59.869 --> 00:25:02.160\n&gt;&gt; The math should line up, right.\n\n464\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.199\nSo I should know that on every\nsingle subnet that I have,\n\n465\n00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:08.318\nthat there should only be 13 bits for\nthe host numbers.\n\n466\n00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:11.946\nIf not,\nall of a sudden there's 15 here and\n\n467\n00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:15.646\nthere's 12 here and there's 10 here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n468\n00:25:15.646 --> 00:25:17.945\nthat train jumped the tracks [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Something changed that shouldn't have\n\n469\n00:25:17.945 --> 00:25:19.470\nchanged, but it does happen.\n\n470\n00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.160\nSo let's go ahead and determine that.\n\n471\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.004\nSo now that we have our new subnet mask,\nwe know what has to happen.\n\n472\n00:25:26.004 --> 00:25:31.666\nNow we start manipulating in\nthe base address that we're given.\n\n473\n00:25:31.666 --> 00:25:36.407\nIn this third bit we're only\ngoing to essentially change these\n\n474\n00:25:36.407 --> 00:25:38.760\nthree bits if we need to.\n\n475\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.210\nNow we know that the very first network,\n\n476\n00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.820\nwe don't have to really\nworry about changing.\n\n477\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.431\nThe only thing that we're changing\nin that first network though,\n\n478\n00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:47.115\nis going to be the subnet mask.\n\n479\n00:25:47.115 --> 00:25:51.090\nLet me bring that up here so\nthat we can see this, right?\n\n480\n00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.196\nBecause the NetworkID,\neven though I'm gonna subnet it,\n\n481\n00:25:54.196 --> 00:25:57.500\nI've now actually counted that\naccording to the subnet mask.\n\n482\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.563\nWe do binary ending, that those are going\nto be considered now part of the network\n\n483\n00:26:01.563 --> 00:26:04.214\nbits that I'm not going to change for\nthis network.\n\n484\n00:26:04.214 --> 00:26:10.270\nAnd now the rest of these is\ngoing to be my HostIDs, okay?\n\n485\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.047\nSo with the new subnet mask here,\n\n486\n00:26:12.047 --> 00:26:15.920\nthat's the only thing that I'm\nreally changing at this point.\n\n487\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.710\nNow the range, of course,\nhas changed from the /16, but\n\n488\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.390\nthat's what's happening here, right?\n\n489\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.320\nSo I also end up putting this\nnotation here too, okay?\n\n490\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.420\nWe're gonna talk about this\na little bit more in detail.\n\n491\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.620\nBut this is just reminding me at\nthis point that it is the first 19\n\n492\n00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.130\nbits of the address is my NetworkID.\n\n493\n00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:45.300\nSo now I can determine the range\nof my NetworkID here, okay?\n\n494\n00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.021\nRemember that the NetworkID,\nall the host bits.\n\n495\n00:26:50.768 --> 00:26:55.600\nThis portion right here for NetworkID in\nbinary is always all zeroes, make sense?\n\n496\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n497\n00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.286\n&gt;&gt; So if I begin for a HostID,\n\n498\n00:26:59.286 --> 00:27:02.657\nsomething I can assign to a device.\n\n499\n00:27:02.657 --> 00:27:04.642\nI changed the least significant bit there.\n\n500\n00:27:04.642 --> 00:27:09.962\nAnd so now that actually\ngives me through 177.80.0.1,\n\n501\n00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:15.730\nmake sure I'm saying that right, 80.1.\n&gt;&gt; This is the first one [LAUGH].\n\n502\n00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.640\n&gt;&gt; It is the first one, but\n\n503\n00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.350\nwhat about the BroadcastID?\n\n504\n00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.530\nThis is where it gets strange\nagain from the class C, right?\n\n505\n00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.760\nBecause it now begins to change here.\n\n506\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.130\nClass C, what is the broadcast address?\n\n507\n00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.705\nWell, if you remember that\nthe broadcast address for\n\n508\n00:27:31.705 --> 00:27:34.810\nus is when all of these\nnumbers change to what?\n\n509\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:41.202\nOnes here, okay?\n\n510\n00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:44.655\nWell, that broadcast now,\nif I don't know what it is,\n\n511\n00:27:44.655 --> 00:27:49.692\nI can convert this octet, Right here,\nI can convert this octet into decimal.\n\n512\n00:27:49.692 --> 00:27:56.740\nNow if you're going, gosh,\ndo I really have to do that?\n\n513\n00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.520\nAt the beginning, yes, you need to\ngo through and do that conversion.\n\n514\n00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.400\n&gt;&gt; This needs to be just\n\n515\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.080\nsecond nature for you.\n\n516\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.059\nYou look at it and see it and it's-\n&gt;&gt; But once you start to actually do a lot\n\n517\n00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:12.341\nof these you go, wait a minute, that bit\nright there is 32, I know that's 32.\n\n518\n00:28:12.341 --> 00:28:17.090\nAnd right below that then, if all the bits\nare turned on, that's gotta equal to 31.\n\n519\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.532\nCuz then if I go to 32 and I turn on this\nbit, all these other ones go to zero.\n\n520\n00:28:21.532 --> 00:28:22.710\n&gt;&gt; They go to zero.\n\n521\n00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.030\n&gt;&gt; So now you're starting to see,\n\n522\n00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:28.020\nhopefully, a little pattern, where you're\nlike, wait a minute, that's what it is.\n\n523\n00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.057\nYeah, so I know at least\nthat network portion is 31.\n\n524\n00:28:30.057 --> 00:28:36.110\nAnd then this right here is all 8s,\nwhich is 255.\n\n525\n00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:42.056\nSo my BroadcastID is essentially\ngoing to be right there.\n\n526\n00:28:42.056 --> 00:28:45.610\nAll network bits as being all 1s, right?\n\n527\n00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.450\nAnd that's what we have, okay?\n\n528\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.955\nSo that is the, oops, I didn't have\nto change it, I already typed it in.\n\n529\n00:28:50.955 --> 00:28:53.522\nI was gonna say, darn.\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering why you were doing it\n\n530\n00:28:53.522 --> 00:28:55.257\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It was just because I keep\n\n531\n00:28:55.257 --> 00:28:59.042\nforgetting everything,\nthat's what happens here.\n\n532\n00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:01.755\nAll right, so it's down here, okay?\n\n533\n00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:06.226\nSo 31.255, now Daniel,\nthis is were people get confused like,\n\n534\n00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:09.578\nhow is that actually one network?\n&gt;&gt; Hold on Ronnie,\n\n535\n00:29:09.578 --> 00:29:11.772\nthat last one can't be right.\n\n536\n00:29:11.772 --> 00:29:14.153\nBecause if it's 32 was the next one,\n\n537\n00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:15.082\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n538\n00:29:15.082 --> 00:29:16.496\n&gt;&gt; Then it can't be 31,\n\n539\n00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:18.555\nit's gotta be 30 or something.\n\n540\n00:29:18.555 --> 00:29:22.542\nBut it's class B, that's the key.\n&gt;&gt; That is the key, so\n\n541\n00:29:22.542 --> 00:29:26.640\nyou've gotta be careful here as you\nstart to take a look here, okay?\n\n542\n00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.550\nSo now you just continue\nto move that third octet.\n\n543\n00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.341\nAnd now remember,\nwe don't care what the first two are.\n\n544\n00:29:34.341 --> 00:29:40.266\nWe changed that number, so it actually\nincremented one up from 00 to 01.\n\n545\n00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:44.269\nAnd once we do that,\nnow you begin to go, hey,\n\n546\n00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:48.010\nlook at that, that's gonna be 32.0.\n\n547\n00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.930\nAnd then your network range is one above\n\n548\n00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:58.600\nthe NetworkID and one down from\nthe BroadcastID and here's the broadcast.\n\n549\n00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.400\nAnd if you talk about one down,\nthat's what it would normally be there.\n\n550\n00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.630\nYou just change that least significant\nbit to a zero, and you're ready to go.\n\n551\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.780\nSo there's the second one, okay?\n\n552\n00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.460\nNow we're not gonna go through the rest\nof these, because you've already\n\n553\n00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.630\ndone this at this point here.\n&gt;&gt; It's lather, rinse,\n\n554\n00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.531\nrepeat at this point.\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty much that,\n\n555\n00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:17.690\nand the only thing that you\nhave to do is verify, right?\n\n556\n00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:22.770\nAnd the easiest way slowly that you verify\nis by doing this right here, right?\n\n557\n00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:27.250\nVerifying your bits,\nonce you get those fundamentals down and\n\n558\n00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.490\nit begins to make sense there,\nthen we can work on increasing in speed.\n\n559\n00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.956\nBut until you start to see this, and\nnow where you can go sixth, seventh, and\n\n560\n00:30:35.956 --> 00:30:37.555\neighth, all the way down.\n\n561\n00:30:37.555 --> 00:30:39.810\nNow we have one last step.\n\n562\n00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:44.172\nWhich is we wanted to make sure that we\ncould determine the number of hosts per\n\n563\n00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:44.793\nnetwork.\n\n564\n00:30:44.793 --> 00:30:48.790\nSo for us, if the network bits is 19,\nthen you just take 32 and\n\n565\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.620\nyou subtract 19 from 32.\n\n566\n00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.200\nThat leaves you with 13 bits, and\n\n567\n00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.200\nthen 2 to the 13th power,\nthat should give you 8,192.\n\n568\n00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.545\nBut we subtract out two numbers for\nthe NetworkID and for the BroadcastID,\n\n569\n00:31:05.545 --> 00:31:10.400\nand now you can actually\nget 8,090 per host, okay?\n\n570\n00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.098\nNow if we compare that to what we\nactually already did up here, so\n\n571\n00:31:15.098 --> 00:31:18.409\nwe were looking for eight networks, right?\n\n572\n00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:21.334\nThis time I kind of fudged\na little bit more here.\n\n573\n00:31:24.225 --> 00:31:28.251\nAnd you can see that I actually picked\nanother network just as a representative\n\n574\n00:31:28.251 --> 00:31:29.350\nexample in this one.\n\n575\n00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.989\nAnd there you go,\neight networks, 8,090 bits here.\n\n576\n00:31:31.989 --> 00:31:32.910\n&gt;&gt; 8,190.\n\n577\n00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.670\n&gt;&gt; 190, excuse me, god,\n\n578\n00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.130\nsee I can't even know.\n\n579\n00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.340\nAnd notice that the NetworkID changed.\n\n580\n00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.090\nSo is this one of my networks\nthat's in what I just showed you?\n\n581\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.986\nIf I scroll down here to the bottom-\n&gt;&gt; You're right in the middle of it.\n\n582\n00:31:45.986 --> 00:31:46.620\n&gt;&gt; In my seventh network.\n\n583\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.850\nYep, I just chose one at random to\nreport so that we could see this.\n\n584\n00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.950\nCuz I wanted you to see that they\ncould be all different numbers here.\n\n585\n00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.990\nAnd that's another thing in the realm\nof Cisco that you want to start paying\n\n586\n00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.100\nattention to.\n\n587\n00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.671\nWhich will help us to get\na little bit faster is this, and\n\n588\n00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:02.221\nwe'll end with this note, too.\n\n589\n00:32:02.221 --> 00:32:05.723\nCisco, as much as we like, and\nespecially in teaching, right?\n\n590\n00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:09.580\nWe want simple numbers, cuz binary\nconversion of 1 is a lot easier than\n\n591\n00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:16.011\nbinary conversion of 177 and 185 and 187.\n&gt;&gt; You see, cuz you gotta do that math\n\n592\n00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:20.480\nthing that everyone is such a big fan of.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n593\n00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.326\nyou're probably saying, so\nwhat Ronnie, what's the big deal?\n\n594\n00:32:23.326 --> 00:32:26.313\nWell, this is just a hint Daniel,\n\n595\n00:32:26.313 --> 00:32:31.884\nCisco is probably not gonna\ntest us on the 0.1 and the 8.1.\n\n596\n00:32:31.884 --> 00:32:36.660\nIt's gonna be something like 191.277-\n&gt;&gt; They like to throw you the hard to\n\n597\n00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.674\nfind ones, right?\n&gt;&gt; Not 277, 256 or 255,\n\n598\n00:32:38.674 --> 00:32:40.206\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; 183.223.57.\n\n599\n00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:43.873\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not in the range that I gave you,\n\n600\n00:32:43.873 --> 00:32:46.993\ncuz those are actually invalid.\n\n601\n00:32:46.993 --> 00:32:51.800\nBut just kind of realize\nthat they're always gonna\n\n602\n00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.020\nbe those kind of higher numbers.\n\n603\n00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.210\nSo we need to learn how\nto work with those,\n\n604\n00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.140\nbut start practicing\nsomething like this here.\n\n605\n00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.670\nAnd once you get that done,\n\n606\n00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.860\nthen we can start working a little\nbit faster at what we have to do.\n\n607\n00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.170\nNow Daniel,\none of the keys that we have to do this,\n\n608\n00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.180\nis that we have to go on\na little bit further.\n\n609\n00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.541\nWe still need to talk about some of\nthe other concepts here with class B,\n\n610\n00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:14.784\nsuch as getting quicker.\n\n611\n00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:18.216\nAnd we still have to talk about CIDR\nnotation just a little bit as well.\n\n612\n00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:23.419\nAnd then we'll get into some practice\nthat should kind of be challenging and\n\n613\n00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:24.895\nfun at the same time.\n\n614\n00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:28.780\nSo Daniel that is the basics\nof class B subnetting.\n\n615\n00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.204\nRemember that the key here is that\nthe networks get really large\n\n616\n00:33:32.204 --> 00:33:35.122\nas the number of hosts start\nshrinking at this point.\n\n617\n00:33:35.122 --> 00:33:39.027\nAnd so you can actually have thousands\nof networks with the class B,\n\n618\n00:33:39.027 --> 00:33:42.191\ninstead of just 100 and\nthen, well, 50 or 60.\n\n619\n00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:46.029\nIt's 60 from that point and less.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, well Ronnie,\n\n620\n00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:47.700\nit's been good stuff so far.\n\n621\n00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.304\nIt's all coming back to me now.\n\n622\n00:33:49.304 --> 00:33:51.920\nIt's been a while since I've\nhad to mess with this stuff.\n\n623\n00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.290\nSo it's a lot of fun,\nit can be challenging.\n\n624\n00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.525\nAnd if you thought you were gonna roll up\nin here thinking that Ronnie's gonna do\n\n625\n00:33:57.525 --> 00:33:58.890\na class B subnetting in one show.\n\n626\n00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.931\nWell, we hate to pull the rug\nout from underneath you.\n\n627\n00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:03.680\nBut we're going into a part two,\nso come back for that.\n\n628\n00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.140\nRonnie, we appreciate your time as always,\nlooking forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n629\n00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.099\nBut let's do it everyone,\nsigning off for ITPro.TV,\n\n630\n00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:13.715\n[LAUGH] I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n631\n00:34:13.715 -->

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:17.833\nand welcome back to another great episode\nof ITPRO.TV, I'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.346\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe're back with more of our CCENT series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:25.126\nAnd of course, joining us yet again in\nthe studio for some more subnetting.\n\n8\n00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:27.993\nClass B subnetting specifically,\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong,\n\n9\n00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:30.694\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:34.237\nThank you for having me on the show as\nwe continue on taking a look at some\n\n11\n00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:36.899\nof the other features inside\nof Class B subnetting.\n\n12\n00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.636\nNow the one we're about to talk about here\nis not really specific to Class B, but\n\n13\n00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:44.553\nwe see it more often applied\nin Class B networks.\n\n14\n00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:49.415\nThe majority of the time because writing\nout a subnet mask, Daniel, when it comes\n\n15\n00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:53.300\ndown to it, is kind of redundant, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.664\n&gt;&gt; 255.255.255.128.192,\n\n17\n00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:01.915\nit becomes insanely\nredundant after a while,\n\n18\n00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:06.937\nreporting on those things\nbecomes redundant as well.\n\n19\n00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:11.407\nAnd then trying to get the information\npassed on from one particular person to\n\n20\n00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:14.457\nanother one,\nit really gets to be very long winded.\n\n21\n00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:18.459\nEven in reporting and writing when we\nhave to say that every single time.\n\n22\n00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.927\nSo one of the things\nthat started to happen,\n\n23\n00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:25.219\nif we kind of back up\nin time just a moment.\n\n24\n00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.530\nLet's kind of remind ourselves\nof a few different things that\n\n25\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.836\nhappened on the Internet as it came along.\n\n26\n00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:35.061\nAs we started depleting addresses, we've\ndone this earlier on another episode.\n\n27\n00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:40.019\nRemember that three or four technologies\nreally did come along to help us\n\n28\n00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:43.283\nto slow down the depletion\nof those addresses.\n\n29\n00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:46.828\nWe've talked about this idea of NAT,\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n30\n00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:50.525\nWhere we now have those private\nIP addresses that aren't valid on\n\n31\n00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:54.037\nthe Internet, that get converted\ninto public IP addresses.\n\n32\n00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:58.117\nAnd there's different methods in how that\nalso works, but the simple one is this,\n\n33\n00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.055\nand so one to one translation, right?\n\n34\n00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:04.124\nYou have public IP addresses and\nyou have private IP addresses and\n\n35\n00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:08.053\nyour router can convert one over\nto another one, if we need to.\n\n36\n00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:12.101\nNow that's usually not just the only\nway that it happens today, but for us,\n\n37\n00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:14.832\nthat's at least the simple\nbasics of what we have.\n\n38\n00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:19.160\nThe other one that we also can do,\nof course, is like we talked about here,\n\n39\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.790\nuse of private IP\naddresses behind a router.\n\n40\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.895\nAnd then, of course, the solution to that\nis the use of IP version 6 addresses,\n\n41\n00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:30.067\nwhich is really starting\nto come on strongly now.\n\n42\n00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:34.719\nA lot of ISPs are now ready for it, most\ncompanies haven't switched over yet, but\n\n43\n00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.890\nthey're probably ready at any time.\n\n44\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.809\nI think even our ISP said that any time we\nwant to convert over, they are ready for\n\n45\n00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.276\nus to convert over, so\nthey've got everything set up.\n\n46\n00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:47.652\nBut let's go back to this one.\n\n47\n00:02:47.652 --> 00:02:50.530\nWhich is really what\nbecame super helpful for\n\n48\n00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.477\nus to slow down the depletion\nof IP addresses on the Internet.\n\n49\n00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:57.512\nWhich is variable length subnet masking.\n\n50\n00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:01.772\nNow once we started actually implementing\nvariable length subnet masking.\n\n51\n00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:06.445\nWhat this actually ends up meaning for\na single company is simple.\n\n52\n00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:10.503\nLet's say, for an example,\nwe have this 192.168.1.0 network,\n\n53\n00:03:10.503 --> 00:03:12.600\nwe can use a Class B\naddress if we need to.\n\n54\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.693\nAnd if we do that, we have one\nnetwork with so many hosts on it.\n\n55\n00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:21.328\nWell, we can now subdivide,\nwhich we've been doing subnetting now for\n\n56\n00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:24.219\nquite a bit of time,\nin taking a look at that.\n\n57\n00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.852\nAnd the problem with the subnetting and\nthe way that we've done it,\n\n58\n00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:30.159\nwhether it's Class C or Class B is simple.\n\n59\n00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.400\nWhen we created eight networks.\n\n60\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.957\nWe understood that each one of those eight\nnetworks were going to give us essentially\n\n61\n00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:38.406\nwhat the same range of IP addresses,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:42.848\nSo the last one that we did,\nwith the eight networks that we did,\n\n63\n00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.875\nI think I had 8,190-\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n64\n00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:46.829\n&gt;&gt; Possible hosts, right?\n\n65\n00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.378\nSo each one of those eight subnets gave\nus equal number of hosts per network.\n\n66\n00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:58.316\nWell, Daniel, in reality, in a business,\neven if it is a large business, okay,\n\n67\n00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:02.075\nwe may find out that there is\none network that's large, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:06.848\nBut then we might find out that we have\nbranch offices that have maybe a handful,\n\n69\n00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:09.927\n15 or maybe less than that,\n10, out of there.\n\n70\n00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:13.623\nSome may have 30 or 25 employees,\n\n71\n00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:18.486\nsome may have 50, but not 120, not 254.\n\n72\n00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:24.275\nSo if we have something like that,\nnow that becomes more challenging.\n\n73\n00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:28.742\nBecause what we want to do is we want\nto conserve address spaces, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:30.895\nSo on the Internet,\nthat is much more important.\n\n75\n00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:35.024\nSo what your ISPs did is they took\nthe addresses they they were given,\n\n76\n00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.667\nsuch as Class C addresses.\n\n77\n00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.181\nAnd then they were actually able to\nchop them off, Daniel calls them,\n\n78\n00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:42.161\nhe goes, I need two IP addresses.\n\n79\n00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.102\nI don't need six,\nI don't need eight, I need two.\n\n80\n00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:49.566\nWell, we have a Class C, Daniel says,\nno, no, no, you're not understanding me.\n\n81\n00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:50.477\n&gt;&gt; That's too much, [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:52.646\n&gt;&gt; Two, I just two.\n\n83\n00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:56.703\nWell, with variable length subnet masking,\nthat can be done.\n\n84\n00:04:56.703 --> 00:05:01.669\nSo ISPs can do that, they can chop\noff a portion of what they can do,\n\n85\n00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.861\nnow, can they give Daniel\nexactly three if he needs it?\n\n86\n00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.270\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; There's limitations.\n\n87\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.631\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is limitations and\n\n88\n00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.324\nlimitation comes back down to what we've\nlearned about, which is the binary, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:15.573\nSo if we remember that\nthose binary place values,\n\n90\n00:05:15.573 --> 00:05:17.402\nthose are the limitations that we have.\n\n91\n00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:20.815\nI can give Daniel one, because I know\nthat the binary value, the place value,\n\n92\n00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:21.446\ngives me one.\n\n93\n00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:26.578\nWe could do two, we know that there's\nthat, we could do four, but three?\n\n94\n00:05:26.578 --> 00:05:28.011\nDaniel would have to go with four.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n95\n00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:28.708\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n96\n00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:33.863\nSo that's what we have, too, so there\nare certain limitations to this as well.\n\n97\n00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:36.887\nAnd when you start dealing\nwith something like this,\n\n98\n00:05:36.887 --> 00:05:40.797\nthere's a little bit of waste in\ncomparison, but not a ton of waste.\n\n99\n00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:42.820\nNot in that same sense.\n\n100\n00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.645\nSo, in the same way where at one time,\n\n101\n00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.883\nif we were to say that\nthis is a Class C address.\n\n102\n00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:50.100\nAnd lets pretend like it's\na public Class C address here.\n\n103\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.724\nAnd I said, Daniel, you have to have 254,\nand he goes, I only need two.\n\n104\n00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:58.330\nWell, those other 252 addresses\nthat we have out there,\n\n105\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.595\nDaniel, you're never going to use them.\n\n106\n00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.774\nSo can you just give them over to me?\n&gt;&gt; I would love\n\n107\n00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:05.513\nto.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n108\n00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:06.685\nyou really can't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:08.114\n&gt;&gt; Because they're assigned to you,\n\n110\n00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:09.501\nand that's what it comes down to.\n\n111\n00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.683\nSo that essentially meant that\nDaniel was going to kind of\n\n112\n00:06:12.683 --> 00:06:14.488\nwaste those 254 addresses.\n\n113\n00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:18.419\nSo variable length subnet masking, though,\n\n114\n00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.467\nallowed ISPs to kind of only\nassign as few as they needed to.\n\n115\n00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.354\nBut still use that same\nnetwork address block.\n\n116\n00:06:26.354 --> 00:06:28.902\nSo here I just took a class\nC because it was simple in\n\n117\n00:06:28.902 --> 00:06:30.800\nwhat we showed you earlier, right?\n\n118\n00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.613\nYou have the possibility of 254\nhost IDs that you can assign, but\n\n119\n00:06:35.613 --> 00:06:39.171\nthen they can break that\ndown to what they need to.\n\n120\n00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.882\nIn the really old days of networking,\nwhen we had T1 connections and\n\n121\n00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:44.617\nserial connections like that.\n\n122\n00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:48.101\nReally the way that worked was Daniel\nwould get one IP address if he only\n\n123\n00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:48.759\nneeded one.\n\n124\n00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.348\nAnd then on the other end,\nwe'd have to use that other address, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:52.348 --> 00:06:55.344\nSo your ISP would actually\nput one address on this side,\n\n126\n00:06:55.344 --> 00:06:57.270\nand the other address on this side.\n\n127\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.604\nAnd then they would make the smallest\nnetwork that was available\n\n128\n00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:04.744\nusing a much larger subnet\nmask at this point.\n\n129\n00:07:04.744 --> 00:07:08.559\nNow when we talk about this\nsubnet mask right here,\n\n130\n00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:13.004\nDaniel, this 255.255.255.252, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:18.634\nWell, you can imagine now that the number\nof addresses from ISPs had to go up.\n\n132\n00:07:18.634 --> 00:07:21.981\nThey started having to write all\nthis stuff down, somebody said,\n\n133\n00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.857\nwe need a better way to do this notation.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sick of writing that down.\n\n134\n00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:27.389\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sick of writing that down.\n\n135\n00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.188\nSo they came up with, most people call it\nslash notation, that's what they call it.\n\n136\n00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:34.921\nBut technically it's\nVariable Length Subnet Masking.\n\n137\n00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:38.035\nAnd they actually implement\nthis slash notation here, and\n\n138\n00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:40.536\nthat's technically part\nof what we call CIDR.\n\n139\n00:07:40.536 --> 00:07:44.867\nC-I-D-R, Classlist Inter Domain Rallying.\n\n140\n00:07:44.867 --> 00:07:48.657\nWhat that means is the classlist, right,\nbecause we've only talked about classful.\n\n141\n00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:50.837\n&gt;&gt; We've been talking classful whole time,\n\n142\n00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:53.562\nClass C and Class Bs all this time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now,\n\n143\n00:07:53.562 --> 00:07:57.136\nwhat have we been doing with Class B and\nClass C networks?\n\n144\n00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:58.719\nWe've been breaking the rules.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n145\n00:07:58.719 --> 00:07:59.456\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n146\n00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:03.247\nWe've been breaking the rules by\nsubdividing those Class B networks\n\n147\n00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:06.657\nBreaking the rules,\nsubdividing up those class C networks.\n\n148\n00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:11.594\nThat's why it's called classless\ninterdomain routing as far\n\n149\n00:08:11.594 --> 00:08:13.185\nas the networks go.\n\n150\n00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.611\nBecause now we can actually\nreach in between and\n\n151\n00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.530\nactually have those smaller\nnetworks as we need them to.\n\n152\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:23.430\nThe big part that begins right here in\nterms of the notation off what you and\n\n153\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.040\nI see.\n\n154\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.600\nAnd you're gonna see a lot more of this.\n\n155\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.900\nEven in regular blogging,\nas you see on the Internet today.\n\n156\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.770\nYou'll not see everybody write\nout the entire subnet mask.\n\n157\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.830\nWhat they'll instead refer to is\nreally just the host bit portion.\n\n158\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.320\nAll right, so let's take a look at this\nidea of this table that I created.\n\n159\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.320\nNow this is all over the internet, what\nwe call classless interdomain routing.\n\n160\n00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.250\nI wanted to type this out so that we\ncould see this pattern in the binary.\n\n161\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.640\nBecause it starts to show you\nthat everything we do in binary,\n\n162\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.430\nthere's gonna be a pattern to it.\n\n163\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.432\nAnd once you start seeing that pattern,\nit's really hard to get out of your head,\n\n164\n00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:03.993\nand you'll start seeing\nkind of this little slope.\n\n165\n00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.830\nI guess is the way to\nactually describe it here.\n\n166\n00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.140\nThe division line of how this ends\nup working with a subnet mask.\n\n167\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.480\nAnd that's what we're really doing,\nis that we're simply reporting\n\n168\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.910\nthat idea of the subnet mask\nin just this notation stud.\n\n169\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.420\nWhich just says take a look at the network\nbits, don't worry about the dots,\n\n170\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.070\ndon't worry about whatever it is.\n\n171\n00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.110\nYou know that there's 32 bits, right,\nin any IP version 4 network, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.280\nBut all you have to do when you see\nthis slash notation now is go ahead and\n\n173\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.390\nsay look,\nI know that means the first 16 bits\n\n174\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.580\nof this address that I'm\ngiving is a network portion.\n\n175\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.350\nFrom that point, it is now you taking that\nand actually continuing to move forward.\n\n176\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.540\nNow the great thing about this, Daniel, is\nafter a while, you're gonna see that same\n\n177\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.200\npattern start to appear again,\nand again, and again.\n\n178\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.080\nSo notice how these\nnumbers go all the way up,\n\n179\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.870\nand then it starts appearing\nin the next octet as well.\n\n180\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.560\nAnd you'll continue to see that over and\nover here, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.090\nSo most of the time when we start\nreferring to some of these,\n\n182\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.360\nthere are special addresses in here that\nyou do want to pay attention to, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.030\nIf I only need to refer to\na single host by itself, okay,\n\n184\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:23.860\nindividually and even in just routing,\nI can do a 32-bit subnet mask.\n\n185\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.830\nAnd say that this is called\n\n186\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.700\nhost to host routing.\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n\n187\n00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.690\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you can do that.\n\n188\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.840\nSo it's not actually even looking for,\nin the host.\n\n189\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.580\nIt's just saying you've got\nthe longest network bit here, or\n\n190\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.560\nthe longest network prefix here.\n\n191\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.570\nWe're gonna use that one.\n\n192\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.930\nAnd that's how routers\nactually start to work,\n\n193\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.780\nis that they start to go look,\nI'm not worried about doing all this.\n\n194\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.030\nI just wanna see which one is\nthe longest string of ones here.\n\n195\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.110\nAnd I consider that actually kind\nof probably the most detailed one.\n\n196\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.910\nSo we'll use that as being\na better route at some point.\n\n197\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.450\nSo you want to actually pay\nattention on that one as well, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.410\nNow once we start to get this, right?\n\n199\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.000\nYou're gonna start seeing this notation\njust about everywhere on the Internet\n\n200\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.210\nreporting the actual size of that network.\n\n201\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.969\nYou should never see an IP address\nwithout either the slash notation or\n\n202\n00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:12.158\nwithout the subnet mask is all.\n\n203\n00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:15.490\nBecause this is how you can identify\nwhat network that they're a part of.\n\n204\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.517\nNow, it's going to be essential,\nas I wrote down here at the bottom of\n\n205\n00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:23.547\nthe screen, that you should be able\nto know quickly when you're given\n\n206\n00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:27.946\nthe subnet mask or the sllash notation\nto be able to report the other, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:33.871\nWhich ones are the tricky ones that\neverybody always kind of gets hammered by,\n\n208\n00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:35.200\nokay?\n\n209\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.778\nThe tricky ones always come really\nright here toward the end, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:41.778 --> 00:11:46.314\nAnd the reason why is a 31,\neven though that is possibly used,\n\n211\n00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:48.920\nmost people will not end up using it.\n\n212\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.930\nEven Cisco says look,\nyou can use it, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.705\nBut their networks,\nif you do a point to point network,\n\n214\n00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:58.186\nwhich only gives you two hosts, and\nyou have along with that, right,\n\n215\n00:11:58.186 --> 00:12:00.034\nthe network ID and the broadcast ID.\n\n216\n00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:05.890\nIt gives you four addresses, well, they\nsay you don't use this 31, but you can.\n\n217\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.286\nIt's just not in general.\n\n218\n00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:09.908\nSo even in subnetting\nquestions on the exam,\n\n219\n00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:12.394\nyou probably won't get anything past it.\n\n220\n00:12:12.394 --> 00:12:18.020\nBut know that the /28 is equal\nto that 255.255.255.248,\n\n221\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.905\nand then going up from that point,\nor excuse me, 240, God my-\n\n222\n00:12:22.905 --> 00:12:24.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.970\n&gt;&gt; My head is going crazy here.\n\n224\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.021\nAnd I even highlighted it,\nand I still got it wrong.\n\n225\n00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:32.170\n240, that's actually a good\ndividing point for you to remember.\n\n226\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.140\nThese numbers here at the end, those are\nthe ones that most people get confused.\n\n227\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.420\nSo if you see one of these notations,\nespecially right here, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.681\nTake a look at whatever that octet is,\nregardless of what it is, but\n\n229\n00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:47.170\nlet's just do class C right\nnow because it's easier.\n\n230\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.938\nClass C here, right,\nwe know that begins with a /24, and\n\n231\n00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:55.127\nthat means all the host bits are 8 bits.\n\n232\n00:12:55.127 --> 00:13:01.111\nAnd then /25 means 7, /26 means 6, and\n\n233\n00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:07.551\nthen 5, and then, of course, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n234\n00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:11.858\nAnd even none at all,\nyou've got to memorize those.\n\n235\n00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:14.390\nAnd I don't know how\nelse to tell you that.\n\n236\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.480\nBe able to associate those numbers along\nwith the subnet mask over here, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.690\nThe other ones, once again,\nstill are in the same place.\n\n238\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.320\nThat's because of this repeatable\npattern and larger numbers, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.560\nAnd I learned this from Tom Landly,\nfor one reason or\n\n240\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:35.370\nanother Cisco has figured out\nwhat we do not like to count in.\n\n241\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.735\nWhich are like 8s, 16,\nhe said nobody know how to count in 16s.\n\n242\n00:13:40.735 --> 00:13:42.688\nEven my memorization tables, right,\n\n243\n00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.195\nwe've got just 12.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n244\n00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:44.902\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n245\n00:13:44.902 --> 00:13:47.736\nin binary you know it's just 2, 4, 8.\n\n246\n00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:50.232\nUsually for us it's 4, 8, 16.\n\n247\n00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:52.229\n16 is what everybody kind of misses.\n\n248\n00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:55.150\nBut he says, if you kind of learned that\nyou should actually be able to get faster.\n\n249\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.660\nSo pay attention here when\nyou start to see this, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.760\nSo those are the numbers,\nand it's the same pattern.\n\n251\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.080\nNotice that this,\nright here in that octet and\n\n252\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.500\nin the fourth octet, they are identical.\n\n253\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.640\nBut remember the differences actually,\nthis is a /20 and\n\n254\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.530\nthis is a /28, it does matter.\n\n255\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.310\nYou are going to get questions\non stuff like this and\n\n256\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.150\nwhat network or\nwhat's the subnet mask to this?\n\n257\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.993\nOr what's the CIDR notation to this thing,\nwhat's it equivalent to?\n\n258\n00:14:31.993 --> 00:14:36.694\nYou are going to see stuff like this,\nand usually once you get to the class\n\n259\n00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:40.990\nB's it is going to be pretty\nmuch in these ranges right here.\n\n260\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.150\nThese other ones up here at the beginning\nare actually relatively easy, right?\n\n261\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.970\nCuz 128, and 192, 224, we've probably\nmemorized those just because we're like,\n\n262\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.640\nyeah I can see that.\n\n263\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.480\nOne more bit, then whatever it is,\nand then two more bits, and three.\n\n264\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.070\nBut once we get to 4, 5 and 6, 7,\nall of a sudden the numbers go,\n\n265\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:05.160\nhold on was that 248 or what that 252,\nor what numbers were those?\n\n266\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.100\nIt begins to get a little bit confusing.\n\n267\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.072\nSo you want to make sure that\nyou pay attention to this.\n\n268\n00:15:10.072 --> 00:15:12.463\nBecause you are going to see more and\nmore,\n\n269\n00:15:12.463 --> 00:15:17.130\nespecially on some exam that you're\ngonna face in the near future, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.590\nNow you're probably not gonna\nsee a lot of subnet masks.\n\n271\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.718\nInstead diagrams will\nprobably look similar.\n\n272\n00:15:23.718 --> 00:15:27.205\nI'm definitely guaranteeing you,\nthey're not gonna look like mine, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:30.700\nThey'll be Cisco branded, pretty much.\n&gt;&gt; But the concept will be the same.\n\n274\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.267\n&gt;&gt; Concept will be the same, but\n\n275\n00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:35.602\njust kind of make sure that you\nunderstand those, too, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:39.528\nThe other thing to also\nremember about subnetting and\n\n277\n00:15:39.528 --> 00:15:42.940\nthis idea is that it\nnever matches up exactly.\n\n278\n00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.450\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about here, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.720\nSo for me,\n\n280\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.550\nlet's say that I do have a network that\nrequires the host that we see here, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.016\nSo let's say that we're right here, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:55.016 --> 00:16:01.125\nI have ten hosts that I need to actually\nbe able to have a network address space.\n\n283\n00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:06.912\nAnd I need to waste as few of\nthe addresses that I can do.\n\n284\n00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:12.257\nWell, at this point, I realize something\nif I know my binary conversion.\n\n285\n00:16:12.257 --> 00:16:15.990\nOkay, if I do eight,\nI don't have enough to do what?\n\n286\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.310\nTo cover this, cuz that really\nonly gives me six addresses.\n\n287\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:24.102\nBut I can't have the ability in binary to\nsay I can need just ten IP addresses for\n\n288\n00:16:24.102 --> 00:16:25.460\nmy devices.\n\n289\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.772\nSo I have to go to my network's next\nnumber, which means I have to know what\n\n290\n00:16:29.772 --> 00:16:34.104\nthat next number is going to be, and\nthat is gonna be a /28 here, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:34.104 --> 00:16:38.337\nAnd I know with a /28 that\nmeans my subnet mask for\n\n292\n00:16:38.337 --> 00:16:43.861\nthis one 255.255.255.240,\nI need to know that.\n\n293\n00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:49.210\nAnd then I've gotta realize that that\ngives me a possibility of 14 hosts,\n\n294\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.977\nbecause of that /28.\n\n295\n00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:54.490\nSo you've got to pay attention to that.\n&gt;&gt; Why does your cloud say 10 hosts?\n\n296\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, excuse me?\n\n297\n00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:56.939\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I said why does your cloud say\n\n298\n00:16:56.939 --> 00:16:57.634\n10 hosts?\n\n299\n00:16:57.634 --> 00:17:00.371\nYou said it was 14.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n300\n00:17:00.371 --> 00:17:00.959\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:02.528\n&gt;&gt; You'll see stuff like that as well.\n\n302\n00:17:02.528 --> 00:17:04.617\nBut yes,\nyou will waste a few addresses sometimes,\n\n303\n00:17:04.617 --> 00:17:05.272\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:07.249\n&gt;&gt; So the very nature of this, right?\n\n305\n00:17:07.249 --> 00:17:09.222\nIs for you to waste as few as possible,\n\n306\n00:17:09.222 --> 00:17:12.540\nespecially in working with\ndiagrams like this as well.\n\n307\n00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.280\nYou need to pick the specific one,\nthe right one for\n\n308\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.012\nwhat you have the ability to do.\n\n309\n00:17:17.012 --> 00:17:20.374\nSo, in the way that we've\nactually done this, now,\n\n310\n00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:25.260\nnotice something else, Daniel, here,\nthat this is actually impossible.\n\n311\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.457\nLook at these numbers here, how in\nthe world is that actually possible?\n\n312\n00:17:29.457 --> 00:17:35.600\nOkay, notice that I got\n192.168.16/28 here,\n\n313\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.680\n192.168/16 here.\n\n314\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.021\nAnd then this one here, that can't be\nright, because it isn't right, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:46.660\nYou've gotta pay attention\nto that as well, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.487\nWhen you start seeing stuff like this.\n\n317\n00:17:48.487 --> 00:17:49.142\nSo regardless,\n\n318\n00:17:49.142 --> 00:17:52.240\nyou want to make sure that you understand\nthat as you start doing this, right?\n\n319\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.496\nIt started off actually with\nthe one network at this point.\n\n320\n00:17:55.496 --> 00:17:58.739\nSo if I start to do\nthe subnetting that I need to do,\n\n321\n00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:04.089\nI need to know what network would actually\ngive me this next bit right here, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:04.089 --> 00:18:06.130\nSo I need to know that and then this one.\n\n323\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.921\nSo this is actually set\nup a little bit long and\n\n324\n00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.871\nsometimes you'll see\nthat on the exam as well.\n\n325\n00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:14.587\nAnd we're gonna show you how to crack\nthat one when we get the variable length\n\n326\n00:18:14.587 --> 00:18:15.231\nsubnet masking.\n\n327\n00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:19.080\nBut let's try not to be super\nconfusing here on some of it.\n\n328\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.973\nJust like you see right here,\n\n329\n00:18:20.973 --> 00:18:26.065\nwhere the actual network bits are\ndifferent over here, this one tough, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:28.580\nIt does give me portions, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.824\nBut notice I've chosen\nthose first 28 bits here.\n\n332\n00:18:31.824 --> 00:18:34.876\nSo, if I start to do something like this,\nokay?\n\n333\n00:18:34.876 --> 00:18:40.810\nI know that we're not gonna mess with\nthe 16, [SOUND] so now I need a dot here.\n\n334\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:45.630\nAnd then I can actually go ahead and start\nfilling some of this in, like this and\n\n335\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.515\ntry and actually figure out what\nthe subnet mask is going to be.\n\n336\n00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:50.477\n&gt;&gt; So I am confused,\n\n337\n00:18:50.477 --> 00:18:54.536\nbecause the networks that we have, or\nmaybe I just missed something here.\n\n338\n00:18:54.536 --> 00:18:59.377\nThe networks that we have are 192.168.1\nand then host, but we're not subnetting it\n\n339\n00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:01.756\nwe're throwing on our /30.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n340\n00:19:01.756 --> 00:19:03.975\n&gt;&gt; I think you've got 192.168.16.\n\n341\n00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:04.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n342\n00:19:04.892 --> 00:19:05.896\n&gt;&gt; Is that meant to, hey,\n\n343\n00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:08.710\nyou gotta look at this on the test\nto make sure they don't try to fool\n\n344\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.223\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n345\n00:19:09.223 --> 00:19:10.546\nthat was just me having-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n346\n00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:12.416\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; An usually bad day of typing\n\n347\n00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:14.730\nis what ended up happening here.\n\n348\n00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.733\nI didn't check this out\nbefore I brought it up.\n\n349\n00:19:16.733 --> 00:19:20.617\nI was using it earlier in another show.\n\n350\n00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:24.230\nSo now, this is something that you\nmight also end up encountering\n\n351\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.208\ninstead.\n&gt;&gt; I got you.\n\n352\n00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:26.522\n&gt;&gt; That's why I said that's not right,\n\n353\n00:19:26.522 --> 00:19:29.447\nas I started looking, I was like I didn't\nactually change the network number.\n\n354\n00:19:29.447 --> 00:19:30.408\nSomewhere over here,\n\n355\n00:19:30.408 --> 00:19:32.024\nI decided it became a 16 instead.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n356\n00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:32.968\nthe second one's an X25 number.\n\n357\n00:19:32.968 --> 00:19:33.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:34.465\n&gt;&gt; So and then now,\n\n359\n00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:37.780\nyou have an X25 number,\nwhich is really bad.\n\n360\n00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.890\nBecause that's actual networking stuff.\n\n361\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:39.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:19:39.668 --> 00:19:42.316\n&gt;&gt; And that should be a /25 at that point,\n\n363\n00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:44.368\nis what we should end up seeing.\n\n364\n00:19:44.368 --> 00:19:49.130\nBut yes, we'll actually have to fill these\nin at some particular point in time as we\n\n365\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.660\nbegin here to take a look\nat the other thing.\n\n366\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:57.500\nSo if I take the first eight network\nnumbers that are actually available.\n\n367\n00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.157\nThen you'd have to go up and go right, so\nwhat is the next available network number\n\n368\n00:20:01.157 --> 00:20:03.490\nthat you can work with, and\nstart to work with that.\n\n369\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.794\nBut we'll do that in variable length\nsubnet masking at another point in time.\n\n370\n00:20:06.794 --> 00:20:09.225\nI just decided not to do that right now.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n371\n00:20:09.225 --> 00:20:09.729\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if not,\n\n372\n00:20:09.729 --> 00:20:12.371\nI'll spend 30 minutes trying to do that.\n&gt;&gt; That's it's own show.\n\n373\n00:20:12.371 --> 00:20:13.579\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's own show.\n\n374\n00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:16.760\nSo I was looking at it like why am I\nmissing, why does that not look right,\n\n375\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.650\nit's because I didn't actually\nhave all four octets.\n\n376\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.192\nBut just pay attention to at least\nthese numbers for right now, and\n\n377\n00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:26.877\nyou'll start to see that there'll\nbe those patterns that you need.\n\n378\n00:20:26.877 --> 00:20:31.700\nBut we'll have this also in the show\nnotes, I don't know how else to do this.\n\n379\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.100\nYou've gotta memorize this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n380\n00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.917\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it,\n\n381\n00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:39.934\ncuz when you get these numbers\nmemorized and to that point of saying,\n\n382\n00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:44.966\nI know that a /20 is this,\nI know a /21 is this, /22 is this.\n\n383\n00:20:44.966 --> 00:20:50.277\nIt will help you out so\nmuch as far as the exam goes.\n\n384\n00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:53.651\nYou'll actually be thankful that\nyou did this because you gotta get\n\n385\n00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:56.149\nfast at doing something like this as well,\nokay?\n\n386\n00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:59.245\nAll right so Daniel,\nup at this point of subnetting, right?\n\n387\n00:20:59.245 --> 00:21:03.551\nWe've talked up class C subnets, we've\ntalked about class B subnets as well.\n\n388\n00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:06.582\nWe've now done a little bit of\nCIDR notation which we had to get\n\n389\n00:21:06.582 --> 00:21:07.810\nfamiliar with.\n\n390\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.792\nYou understand how the Subnet mask\nworks in everything that we do, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:15.759\nSo now, according to my notes here, right?\n\n392\n00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.393\nIt means it's time for\n\n393\n00:21:17.393 --> 00:21:23.280\nus to learn some different methods to get\na little bit faster to be able to do this.\n\n394\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.220\nAnd we're also gonna take a look at some\npossible exam type questions that you\n\n395\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:28.985\nwill face.\n\n396\n00:21:28.985 --> 00:21:32.075\nAnd we'll kind of go through those to\nmake sure that we give you some practice\n\n397\n00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:32.622\nat doing it.\n\n398\n00:21:32.622 --> 00:21:34.390\nBut, once we do that, right?\n\n399\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.605\nIt means that it's all on you, okay?\n\n400\n00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:38.110\nEverything that we do at this point,\nright?\n\n401\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.942\nI can't help you out anymore, except\nby showing you more and more examples.\n\n402\n00:21:41.942 --> 00:21:46.505\nBut the examples that we gave you are good\nexamples, even though it took a long time,\n\n403\n00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:49.655\nwe were very meticulous at\nexplaining every detail of it so\n\n404\n00:21:49.655 --> 00:21:52.511\nthat you can go back and\nwatch it again if you need to.\n\n405\n00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.840\nBut just take the time to do so.\n\n406\n00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.074\nSo next, Daniel, here we go in\nthe next part of our series, right?\n\n407\n00:21:59.074 --> 00:22:03.828\nWe are going to look at some of possible\ntypes of questions, and then how do you\n\n408\n00:22:03.828 --> 00:22:08.399\nget wicked fast at doing this stuff, okay?\n&gt;&gt; It is all about the speed when it\n\n409\n00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:09.754\ncomes to a Cisco exam.\n\n410\n00:22:09.754 --> 00:22:13.819\nSo we wanna get you as fast as possible\nbecause like we've mentioned in previous\n\n411\n00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:17.044\nepisodes, you got around on\naverage one minute per question.\n\n412\n00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:22:18.528 --> 00:22:19.771\n&gt;&gt; I have a hard time reading\n\n414\n00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:23.201\na question in one minute,\nlet alone reading it, comprehending it,\n\n415\n00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:27.183\nlooking at the answers and answering\nthe thing, it does get a little daunting.\n\n416\n00:22:27.183 --> 00:22:28.798\nSo the faster we can get you guys,\n\n417\n00:22:28.798 --> 00:22:31.220\nthe better you're gonna have a chance-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n418\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:31.720\n&gt;&gt; At the exam, so\n\n419\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.498\nI can't wait to see the rest\nof those tricks, Ronnie.\n\n420\n00:22:33.498 --> 00:22:34.567\n&gt;&gt;

It's going fine, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.832\nThank you again for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to take a look,\n\n13\n00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:39.525\neven though this title is actually titled,\nUnderstanding Class B70.\n\n14\n00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.915\nWe are going to do come class B subnetting\nhere, but in a different way, okay?\n\n15\n00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:47.814\nIs what we're actually going to do, which\nis now that you have the fundamentals,\n\n16\n00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.719\nand we've taken you through\nthe slowest possible method as you do\n\n17\n00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.785\nClass C subnetting and\nClass B subnetting, okay?\n\n18\n00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:56.980\nAnd you'll have all the examples there for\nyou.\n\n19\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.520\nThose are patterns that\nyou just have to know.\n\n20\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.400\nAnd once you get the pattern\ndown rock solid, right?\n\n21\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.490\nAnd you're doing this daily, and\nyou're actually good at doing this daily,\n\n22\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.460\nwe now need to get you ready to\nspeed up for the exam, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.710\nAnd the reason behind this\nis you cannot take the time\n\n24\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.830\nto break down everything\ninto the binary on the exam.\n\n25\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820\nYou're gonna take the time to\ndo that in preparation, right?\n\n26\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.710\nUnderstanding those fundamentals.\n\n27\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.080\nSecondly, the reason behind\nthe binary fundamentals that\n\n28\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.430\nEven if nothing else, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.915\nEven if you can't remember\nanything we're about to show you.\n\n30\n00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.040\n[LAUGH] Okay?\n\n31\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.080\nIf you go what?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.860\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember that tip at all.\n\n33\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.020\nYou at least at this point,\n\n34\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.915\nif you've done enough of the binary,\nyou'll be able to do it.\n\n35\n00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.130\nOkay?\n\n36\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.403\nYou'll not be able to do it quickly\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:45.403 --> 00:01:46.023\n&gt;&gt; But you will be able to do\n\n38\n00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:46.830\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n39\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.390\nyou'll have the fundamental skills for\nwhat the C set requires of you as well.\n\n40\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.290\nSo now we are moving on,\nwe are now starting to get quicker and\n\n41\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.250\nwe're now ready to show\nyou the actual ideas and\n\n42\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.850\nsome of the concepts out there that\nwill make you faster at doing this\n\n43\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.000\nin preparation for the exam.\n&gt;&gt; So, we want to get started here,\n\n44\n00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.610\nI want to talk about a couple of different\nmethods that can really help you out.\n\n45\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.170\nNow you might be wondering like, Ronnie,\nif we're just preparing for the exam,\n\n46\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.860\nwhy did you take that time to\nshow us all the rest of that?\n\n47\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.240\nWell, it's because this is not just\nabout exam preparation, right?\n\n48\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.240\nThis is about just trying to get you\nready, not only for networking in the real\n\n49\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.500\nworld, but also for the very fact that\nyou're gonna go beyond this exam and\n\n50\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.570\nyou're gonna take more exams, and you're\ngonna be expected to subnet there as well.\n\n51\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.820\nAnd it won't just be\nthe relatively easy types of\n\n52\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.660\nsubbing that we're doing right here,\nit may start to actually even\n\n53\n00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.867\ngo beyond what you're actually\nlearning a little bit more here, too.\n\n54\n00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:45.480\nSo we wanted to make sure that you had\nsolid fundamentals down first, and\n\n55\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.460\nthat's why I feel confident that we can\nshow you some of these different shortcuts\n\n56\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.400\nthat will help you out as\nyou get ready for the exam.\n\n57\n00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.070\nSo the neat thing, Daniel,\nis that if all we had to do was provide\n\n58\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.330\njust this idea for regular working\nin a real network, most people would\n\n59\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.010\njust bring up a subnet and calculator.\n&gt;&gt; Yes they would.\n\n60\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.280\n&gt;&gt; That is all practical reality, right?\n\n61\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.480\nThat they'll do that.\n\n62\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.160\nBut any certification exam and heck,\nDaniel, I've even heard about this and\n\n63\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.530\nI don't know how true it is now, but when\nI first started getting into networking\n\n64\n00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.394\nas a networking professional,\nnot just working on computers,\n\n65\n00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:24.330\nI heard that there were hiring\nprofessionals that would say,\n\n66\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.310\nall right, subnet this network,\njust to see if you could do it.\n\n67\n00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.090\nI really hope that that's not a basis for\nhiring someone,\n\n68\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.680\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; I hope not.\n\n69\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.600\n&gt;&gt; It could still be.\n\n70\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I would immediately pull\n\n71\n00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:39.252\nout my phone and go, yeah, not a problem,\nhold on, give me a second.\n\n72\n00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:39.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:40.754\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n74\n00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:41.831\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I mean,\n\n75\n00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:42.960\nI really hope that that's not.\n\n76\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.400\nIt used to be one of\nthose practical things.\n\n77\n00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.401\n&gt;&gt; You just gotta know it cuz some\n\n78\n00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:49.720\npeople just throw that out.\n&gt;&gt; Well it was a really good litmus test\n\n79\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720\nfor back in the day-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n80\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.260\n&gt;&gt; To see if someone really knew about\n\n81\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.960\nnetworking.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n82\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.688\n&gt;&gt; Because you would have learned those\n\n83\n00:03:54.688 --> 00:03:55.430\nconcepts and [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n84\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.690\nYeah, if you knew subnetting,\n\n85\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.280\nyou probably did understand the networking\nconcepts that were behind it as well.\n\n86\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.390\nSo at this point though,\njust kinda realize that it's an art that\n\n87\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.020\nis still out there, and it's also\na practical art in terms of exams, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.270\nAnd that's kind of the key\nin why we're doing this.\n\n89\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.030\nSo how do we get faster at doing this?\n\n90\n00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.530\nOne of the main methods that we have,\nand we'll take a look at my screen here.\n\n91\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.332\nI just pulled up just another\nwhite sheet of paper for us.\n\n92\n00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:22.540\nIt's what is called the magic\nnumber method, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.790\nThe cool thing about this is, it only\nrequires two elements to help us out here.\n\n94\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.526\nI say that,\nmaybe three elements all together.\n\n95\n00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:32.160\nBefore I know it, it's gonna be ten\nelements as I start to add up here, but\n\n96\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.440\nit really requires just\ntwo basic elements, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.452\nOne is that you can memorize\nthis number right here, okay?\n\n98\n00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:40.996\n256.\n\n99\n00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:44.292\nAll right Daniel, you got that one?\n&gt;&gt; 226, I got it.\n\n100\n00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:44.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:04:44.982 --> 00:04:45.715\n&gt;&gt; That's cool, you got it.\n\n102\n00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:46.680\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna fail [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.240\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna fail big time.\n\n104\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.850\nBut yes, just memorizing 256, you are\nhalfway through being able to subnet just\n\n105\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.640\nabout any question that's on the exam.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n106\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.280\n&gt;&gt; If you can keep that in mind.\n\n107\n00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.990\nAnd remember, class B's can play\na trick on you as you're doing this, so\n\n108\n00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.890\nbe careful here, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.350\nOnce you do that, the other thing you have\nto know is what is the actual subnet Mask?\n\n110\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.650\nThe great thing is,\nyou should never see what?\n\n111\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.110\nAn IP address, whether on the exam or\nin the real world without what?\n\n112\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.734\nIP address and?\n&gt;&gt; Subnet Mask.\n\n113\n00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:21.559\n&gt;&gt; Subnet Mask.\n\n114\n00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:27.360\nSo you've got both of those elements\nthere, the third element is subtraction.\n\n115\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.290\nI know, that's the symbol for\nsubtraction in notepad, which is a dash.\n\n116\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.989\nSo, it's the smallest element\nin here that I can have,\n\n117\n00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:40.004\nbut if you can take that subnet,\nthat number 256, and for\n\n118\n00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:44.334\nus the subnet Mask is actually just\na portion of that subnet Mask,\n\n119\n00:05:44.334 --> 00:05:47.668\nwhich is normally the octet that changes,\nokay?\n\n120\n00:05:47.668 --> 00:05:49.339\nSo, if we're given, right?\n\n121\n00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:54.020\nA class C network, right?\n\n122\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.030\nDaniel, we know that in class C network,\nmy subnetting only happens where?\n\n123\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.620\nThe fourth octet.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.700\n&gt;&gt; Class B though,\n\n125\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.323\nit can happen in the third and\nforth octet, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:03.323 --> 00:06:07.760\nSo I have to pay attention, but\nif I do that, I just pay attention to\n\n127\n00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.280\nthose numbers right there in the third and\nin the fourth octet of our Class B, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.600\nSo if I can do this here, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.730\nWhat we can do is we can take a number\nlike this, and to help us out So\n\n130\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.410\nI'm giving us an example right away.\n\n131\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.540\nLet's say, Daniel, that what we have\nhere is something like this, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.210\nHere I know the original network, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.670\nSo just as a basic starter,\n\n134\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.322\nwe've done subnetting before.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n135\n00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:35.497\n&gt;&gt; So if we started with just a class B\n\n136\n00:06:35.497 --> 00:06:40.707\nnetwork, I'm not saying that they'd\ngive me that same network, but this time\n\n137\n00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:44.290\nwith a /20 instead of a /16, all right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n138\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.410\n&gt;&gt; So I know I'm never gonna actually even\n\n139\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.590\nworry about these two octets, right?\n\n140\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.300\nNot going to worry about them.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n141\n00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.430\n&gt;&gt; They're set in stone,\n\n142\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.290\nwe're not gonna play with it, but\n\n143\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.510\nnow, I just take the octet that's\ninteresting or active, action.\n\n144\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.440\nSome people call it the action subnet, or\n\n145\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.170\nthe action octet,\nwhatever you want to call it here.\n\n146\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.335\nI don't have fancy names, it's just\nthe third octet to me for now, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:11.402\nI just take 256, and\nthen I subtract out the value\n\n148\n00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:15.560\nin that third octet and that gives me 16.\n\n149\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.440\nNow, why the heck does that matter, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.066\nThe reason why that matters\nis that gives me my interval\n\n151\n00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:27.730\nbetween subnets, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.420\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n153\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.748\nWell, now that I have\nthe original 172.16 31.0.0,\n\n154\n00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:42.678\nand let's do a /20 here,\nmy next network is 172.16, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:44.510\nDang it, I got too many numbers.\n\n156\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.372\nDaniel.\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n157\n00:07:45.372 --> 00:07:45.906\n&gt;&gt; You're killing me.\n\n158\n00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:46.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n159\n00:07:46.912 --> 00:07:49.609\n&gt;&gt; I'm so used to typing .16,\n\n160\n00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:54.900\nI was trying to be helpful by\nchanging some numbers here, but\n\n161\n00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.426\nnow I know that the next interval\nnetwork is gonna be 16.0.\n\n162\n00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:03.990\nAnd then 172.31 and\n\n163\n00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:09.896\nthis should be, 32.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n164\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.763\n&gt;&gt; 72.31,\n\n165\n00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:16.338\nthis should be 48.\n&gt;&gt; 48.\n\n166\n00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:22.790\nLast 20 and etc., all right.\n\n167\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.454\nSo right away then, een when,\n\n168\n00:08:24.454 --> 00:08:27.060\ndid we have to do any binary?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n169\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.370\n&gt;&gt; Did I have to do any binary?\n\n170\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.295\nI didn't even tell you to determine\nwhat the NetworkID is, or\n\n171\n00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.959\nthe BroadcastID, or the Range.\n\n172\n00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:41.170\nBut Daniel from that point, okay?\n\n173\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.015\nFor 172.31.16.0 here, right?\n\n174\n00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:43.707\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n175\n00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:44.445\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n176\n00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:49.723\nwe know that this one is the network,\nwhich I can't spell.\n\n177\n00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:52.739\nNetworkID, So Daniel,\n\n178\n00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:57.734\nwhat is my valid range here?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n179\n00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:04.184\nyour valid range is gonna be 172.31.16.1,\nand that is going to go to .30.\n\n180\n00:09:04.184 --> 00:09:10.265\n.30, yeah, 16, yeah that's right,\nit's a class B.\n\n181\n00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:16.272\nSo yeah, it'll be 31.254.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:17.144\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n183\n00:09:17.144 --> 00:09:18.181\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n184\n00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:18.980\nyou were right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.360\n&gt;&gt; So I was already going to the broadcast\n\n186\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.982\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; So the broadcast then, would be 172.16,\n\n187\n00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:31.130\nsheesh, 31, that's what I get.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're loving it?\n\n188\n00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.640\nYou really kicked yourself\nin the foot there.\n\n189\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.154\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm really going to do\n\n190\n00:09:35.154 --> 00:09:35.886\nthat, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:39.181\nAnd this is gonna be .255.\n\n192\n00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:45.355\nAll right, so to verify that this is not\n\n193\n00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.912\njust a trick with this network.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:09:47.912 --> 00:09:48.742\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n195\n00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:51.802\nthat this is not just a trick\nwith this type of network here,\n\n196\n00:09:51.802 --> 00:09:54.262\nlet's go to just a class C and\ndo the same thing.\n\n197\n00:09:54.262 --> 00:09:59.873\nSo if I do 192.168.10.0 here with a /24.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n198\n00:09:59.873 --> 00:10:03.048\nyour broadcast address should be a 31.\n&gt;&gt; Should it?\n\n199\n00:10:03.048 --> 00:10:03.556\nYeah, crap.\n&gt;&gt; Should\n\n200\n00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:04.056\nbe 172.31.31.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry.\n\n201\n00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:07.798\n31, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:07.798 --> 00:10:09.468\n&gt;&gt; This is what we've been talking about\n\n203\n00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:11.945\nthe whole series.\nYou get used to doing that class C\n\n204\n00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.150\nbusiness.\n&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah.\n\n205\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.464\n&gt;&gt; And you don't practice these class Bs,\n\n206\n00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:16.273\nthey will get you every time.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n207\n00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:17.664\n&gt;&gt; So you gotta make sure to jumble\n\n208\n00:10:17.664 --> 00:10:21.630\nthem up, so that you're prepared to just\nshuck and jive whatever you need to do.\n\n209\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.442\nBe agile as they say.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no, great reminder, because I've\n\n210\n00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:28.690\njust, you can see where my particular\ntyping ability, that doesn't help either.\n\n211\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.507\nBut [LAUGH] it's just the idea of\nhaving to type these numbers, I'm so\n\n212\n00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:34.298\nused to typing 172.16 all the time-\n&gt;&gt; I do the same things, yeah.\n\n213\n00:10:34.298 --> 00:10:35.008\n&gt;&gt; That 31 just kinda, but\n\n214\n00:10:35.008 --> 00:10:37.150\nI knew that that was that private range,\nI was like, let's stay in there and-\n\n215\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.494\n&gt;&gt; Plus it's good to not work in your\n\n216\n00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:39.511\ncomfort zone, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n217\n00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.029\n&gt;&gt; Get out of that comfort zone,\n\n218\n00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:44.020\nbecause that test is not gonna\nbe in your comfort zone.\n\n219\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.564\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, all right so\n\n220\n00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:47.585\nDaniel let's do this here, okay?\n\n221\n00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:50.836\nSo I'll actually kind of give\nyou the choice here, okay?\n\n222\n00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:51.893\n&gt;&gt; Don't do it.\n\n223\n00:10:51.893 --> 00:10:53.576\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just give me a subnet,\n\n224\n00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:57.590\nsomething that we would subnet\noff of this class C address.\n\n225\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:04.189\nSo just give me a subnet mask.\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go with 255.255.255,\n\n226\n00:11:04.189 --> 00:11:07.550\nman, how about who 2, what is it?\n\n227\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.970\nNo let's do 192, what the heck.\n&gt;&gt; 192, okay, yeah.\n\n228\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:10.798\nSo we'll do 192 here, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:14.478\nSo we'll follow the same pattern,\nthat way we've done a class B.\n\n230\n00:11:14.478 --> 00:11:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n231\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.595\n&gt;&gt; Do a class C now and\n\n232\n00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:21.446\nverify that I'm not making this up and and\nyou're gonna say, it only worked one time,\n\n233\n00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:21.989\nRonnie.\n\n234\n00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:24.470\nThat's terrible, okay.\n\n235\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.948\nSo now, we just take the action octet and\nwe have our magic number, right?\n\n236\n00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:32.418\n256 and we subtract out 192, and\n\n237\n00:11:32.418 --> 00:11:35.812\nthat gives me, 64, okay?\n\n238\n00:11:35.812 --> 00:11:39.070\nSo that is my interval.\n\n239\n00:11:41.228 --> 00:11:44.940\nInterval between subnets.\n\n240\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.446\nSo on this one, let's go ahead and,\nonce again I will try to\n\n241\n00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:53.530\nreduce my amount of typing here.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n242\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.695\nAnd we'll change this, so\n\n243\n00:11:56.695 --> 00:12:00.665\nthis one will be reported with 192,\nthat's actually 2 extra bits.\n\n244\n00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:03.815\nSo 24 plus 2 is gonna be 26,\nwhich is the 192, right?\n\n245\n00:12:03.815 --> 00:12:04.528\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n246\n00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:06.640\n&gt;&gt; The two 1s there at the beginning.\n\n247\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.610\nSo now Daniel,\nI know that the interval is actually 64,\n\n248\n00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.703\nthat is my first network.\n&gt;&gt; What should my second network actually\n\n249\n00:12:15.703 --> 00:12:21.907\nbe?\n&gt;&gt; It should be 192.168.10.64.\n\n250\n00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:26.903\n&gt;&gt; 64, and now Daniel, what should my\n\n251\n00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:31.912\nthird one be?\n&gt;&gt; Should be 192.168.10.128.\n\n252\n00:12:31.912 --> 00:12:32.507\n&gt;&gt; Oops.\n\n253\n00:12:32.507 --> 00:12:34.453\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:35.852\n&gt;&gt; 128, I still can't do a 1.\n\n255\n00:12:35.852 --> 00:12:36.626\n&gt;&gt; That's not a 1, that's a back tick.\n\n256\n00:12:36.626 --> 00:12:37.956\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're kidding me.\n\n257\n00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:38.799\n&gt;&gt; Back tick 28,\n\n258\n00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.945\nman you see that network you better run.\n&gt;&gt; Back tick 28.\n\n259\n00:12:40.945 --> 00:12:41.781\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:42.851\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n261\n00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:45.163\nthen the fourth one here Daniel.\n\n262\n00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:46.058\nIs it?\n\n263\n00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:49.805\n128 plus 64 is gonna be?\n\n264\n00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:51.556\n&gt;&gt; 192.\n&gt;&gt; 192?\n\n265\n00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:55.690\nYeah, 192, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Then we have this last one.\n\n266\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.138\nIf I actually do a 64 here, in theory-\n&gt;&gt; You're really stressing the limits of\n\n267\n00:12:59.138 --> 00:13:00.944\nmy ability to do math.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are now stretching,\n\n268\n00:13:00.944 --> 00:13:01.546\nright.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:03.639\n&gt;&gt; But that is gonna be 256,\n\n270\n00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:05.040\nwhich is invalid.\n\n271\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?.\n\n272\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:06.790\n&gt;&gt; No worky.\n\n273\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Invalid as far as the ID goes.\n\n274\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.650\nNow technically that number is Invalid.\n\n275\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.790\nIn reality what would happen here, right?\n\n276\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.680\nIs that we would switch this and\nthis would become an 11.0, and\n\n277\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.510\nit would continue to\ngo on if we wanted to.\n\n278\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.662\nBut usually we kind of just\nrun out once we hit that 256.\n\n279\n00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:28.474\nThis would not be considered.\n&gt;&gt; Just if you done with making networks,\n\n280\n00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.267\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be done for\n\n281\n00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:33.120\nus making a network for that one, okay?\n\n282\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.090\nSo Daniel, with those two examples, okay?\n\n283\n00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.179\nJust in basic subnetting questions, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n284\n00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.969\n&gt;&gt; I could actually easily do a lot with\n\n285\n00:13:41.969 --> 00:13:43.840\njust that, okay?\n\n286\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.008\nDetermine the NetworkID because you've\nalready given helpful hints in class B and\n\n287\n00:13:48.008 --> 00:13:49.990\nclass C how to actually do that.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n288\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.667\n&gt;&gt; And now we can do the Broadcast\n\n289\n00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:56.299\naddress, we can determine the Range, and\nwe didn't have to do any binary at all,\n\n290\n00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:57.932\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; There was zero binary conversions\n\n291\n00:13:57.932 --> 00:13:59.627\ninside of this example Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n292\n00:13:59.627 --> 00:14:03.367\nwe just did two problems very\nquickly where I have confidence,\n\n293\n00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:08.109\nDaniel, that you can actually determine\nNetworkID, Range, and Broadcast.\n\n294\n00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:12.149\nAnd that you can determine that very\neasily, and whereas one question before\n\n295\n00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:14.734\ntook us nearly 30 minutes to accomplish.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:14:14.734 --> 00:14:16.410\n&gt;&gt; Because I was showing you slowly-\n\n297\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:16.939\n&gt;&gt; Step by step.\n\n298\n00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.140\n&gt;&gt; One at a time, step by step.\n\n299\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.730\nNow notice that we can do this, okay?\n\n300\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:27.967\nSo the key is for you to again practice\nsomething like this to help you out, okay?\n\n301\n00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:32.905\nNow remember I have also said\nthis in the previous episode,\n\n302\n00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:37.550\nCisco doesn't really like\nthis idea of easy numbers.\n\n303\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.896\n[LAUGH] I don't know how\nelse to describe this, okay?\n\n304\n00:14:39.896 --> 00:14:43.604\nSo that means that you'll actually\nend up seeing some of the numbers\n\n305\n00:14:43.604 --> 00:14:45.695\nthat are going to be relatively high.\n\n306\n00:14:45.695 --> 00:14:50.945\nThose numbers that are low,\nwe're fairly good at, right?\n\n307\n00:14:50.945 --> 00:14:53.831\n128, the 64, the 32, the 16.\n\n308\n00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:55.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Those are easy.\n\n309\n00:14:55.492 --> 00:14:56.955\n&gt;&gt; It's been a while since I've taken\n\n310\n00:14:56.955 --> 00:14:57.547\na Cisco exam.\n\n311\n00:14:57.547 --> 00:15:01.313\nBut they love to ask you questions like,\nhere's a IP address,\n\n312\n00:15:01.313 --> 00:15:03.880\nwhat is the network that that falls under?\n\n313\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.697\nAnd they give you a list of networks,\nand you try t answer it, right?\n\n314\n00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, but\n\n315\n00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.534\nthey're always gonna be\nthese kind of high numbers.\n\n316\n00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:10.646\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, nothing, that's easy,\n\n317\n00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:13.023\nI know that off the top of my head, uh-uh.\n\n318\n00:15:13.023 --> 00:15:16.440\nSo I'm going to do the math scratch and\nwork it out.\n\n319\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.030\n&gt;&gt; So that is one way to do that, right?\n\n320\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.680\nSo if you actually have to\ntake the time to do the math,\n\n321\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.650\ntake the time to do the math.\n\n322\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.520\nBut let me tell you a Todd Lammle secret.\n\n323\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.587\nI'm dropping his name on purpose,\nnot because I know Todd Lammle,\n\n324\n00:15:30.587 --> 00:15:33.198\nnot because I worked with him.\n&gt;&gt; You did work with him?\n\n325\n00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:33.815\n&gt;&gt; No, [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:15:33.815 --> 00:15:38.356\nI'm teasing about dropping his name,\nbut, I was fast at subnetting, okay?\n\n327\n00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:41.570\nTodd Lammle made me faster, okay?\n\n328\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.870\nAnd the reason why he did is not because\nit was some magic thing that he did.\n\n329\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.950\nHe said, Ronnie, he says you just have to\nwork on your memory a little bit, right?\n\n330\n00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.863\nSo when Todd and I did this,\nhe was like, Ronnie can you subnet this?\n\n331\n00:15:52.863 --> 00:15:54.740\nI was like, I sure can.\n\n332\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.433\nAnd I did it, right there on the spot.\n\n333\n00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:56.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Daniel\n\n334\n00:15:56.425 --> 00:15:57.168\nremembers that show.\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n335\n00:15:57.168 --> 00:15:59.072\n&gt;&gt; When we did that, which is fine.\n\n336\n00:15:59.072 --> 00:16:04.290\nBut learning his method,\nall of a sudden it was just easy.\n\n337\n00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.970\nSo what is his particular\nmethod that helps us out here?\n\n338\n00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.880\nLet me make sure I do this.\n\n339\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.480\nBelieve it or not, it actually comes from\n\n340\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.440\nmemorization of a few things.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n341\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.750\n&gt;&gt; The great thing is,\n\n342\n00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.150\nyou already know how to\ndo the majority of this.\n\n343\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.970\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n344\n00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.185\nSo there's a few of them\nthat's relatively easy for\n\n345\n00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:29.628\nus to understand what\nthe network interval is, right?\n\n346\n00:16:29.628 --> 00:16:35.343\n128, Daniel, right off the bat I\nknow that it's going to be 0128 and\n\n347\n00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:36.787\nI'm kind of done.\n\n348\n00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.354\nThat's the easy one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 256.\n\n349\n00:16:38.354 --> 00:16:40.781\n&gt;&gt; Bingo, okay, I am done.\n\n350\n00:16:40.781 --> 00:16:43.858\n64, 0, 64, 128.\n\n351\n00:16:43.858 --> 00:16:48.943\n192, I know 256 is in [CROSSTALK],\nso we've got three of these.\n\n352\n00:16:48.943 --> 00:16:51.098\n&gt;&gt; Just squared away and ready to rock.\n\n353\n00:16:51.098 --> 00:16:52.740\n&gt;&gt; Squared away and ready to rock, okay.\n\n354\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.380\nThe next one may be a little\nbit challenging if we're not\n\n355\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.330\ngood at doing this, okay?\n\n356\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.870\nBut if we can memorize this pattern,\nright,\n\n357\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.981\nonce I see that my network interval is 32,\nright?\n\n358\n00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:08.280\nI just have to actually be able to go\nall the way up to the other end, okay,\n\n359\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.400\nto where I bottom out or\nend up here at 256, okay?\n\n360\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:18.310\nSo, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160,\nthat's the one that gets me.\n\n361\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:23.696\nSo, also in 120 I'm gonna [CROSSTALK]\n32 and then start doing that.\n\n362\n00:17:23.696 --> 00:17:29.340\nAnd then 192, 224, 256, so\nthat one's a little bit harder, okay?\n\n363\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.620\nBut notice,\nthere's really only six, seven,\n\n364\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.180\neight numbers, actually seven altogether.\n\n365\n00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.470\nCuz 256 doesn't really matter for\nus here at this point, okay?\n\n366\n00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.190\nThe one that Todd swears, okay,\nare pretty much these two.\n\n367\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.500\nThese are the two that most\npeople just are going to not\n\n368\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.600\nbe able to do this very quickly.\n&gt;&gt; So if you get this, and\n\n369\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.250\nyou put it on a flash card or whatever,\nand you ramble this off ten times a day\n\n370\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.480\nuntil it's just brute force memorized.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n371\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.678\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be really set to jam when\n\n372\n00:17:57.678 --> 00:17:59.871\nit comes to this exam.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because as soon as that, so\n\n373\n00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.941\nnow let's put this together\nwith what we've just\n\n374\n00:18:01.941 --> 00:18:03.370\nlearned, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.301\n&gt;&gt; Once I see my action octet, okay,\n\n376\n00:18:07.301 --> 00:18:09.612\nthe 248, okay?\n\n377\n00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:12.380\nAnd I know that it doesn't matter\nwhat number that they give me,\n\n378\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.033\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n379\n00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:14.007\n&gt;&gt; If I see 248,\n\n380\n00:18:14.007 --> 00:18:17.286\nI know that the network ID has\nto be one of these numbers.\n\n381\n00:18:17.286 --> 00:18:19.492\n&gt;&gt; One of these numbers.\n\n382\n00:18:19.492 --> 00:18:22.256\nSo if you see an IP address,\nand it's between one of those,\n\n383\n00:18:22.256 --> 00:18:24.770\nyou know exactly what network it's on.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n384\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.410\n&gt;&gt; There's the answer,\n\n385\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.260\nclick, you're done.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n386\n00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.348\n&gt;&gt; Tell me how much faster that is.\n\n387\n00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:30.861\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's fast, yeah cuz I'm not going,\n\n388\n00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:33.485\nholy crap he's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:35.285\n&gt;&gt; That would be very fast.\n\n390\n00:18:35.285 --> 00:18:36.801\n&gt;&gt; Now the problem that happened, right,\n\n391\n00:18:36.801 --> 00:18:39.160\nwe talked about lower numbers, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n392\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.248\n&gt;&gt; Lower numbers, we can do this, so\n\n393\n00:18:41.248 --> 00:18:44.786\neven at the eight, right,\ncounting in eight right here.\n\n394\n00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:45.320\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n395\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I can do up to 64 and then,\n\n396\n00:18:49.522 --> 00:18:50.022\n&gt;&gt; Once I get there-\n\n397\n00:18:50.022 --> 00:18:50.811\n&gt;&gt; Sort of stuff breaks down, yeah.\n\n398\n00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:53.343\n&gt;&gt; 72, 80, 88,\n\n399\n00:18:53.343 --> 00:18:55.112\nchicken?\n&gt;&gt; 96?\n\n400\n00:18:55.112 --> 00:18:56.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:18:56.192 --> 00:18:57.349\n&gt;&gt; But once we start getting that three\n\n402\n00:18:57.349 --> 00:18:59.400\ndigits, that's where it becomes difficult.\n\n403\n00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.820\nBut notice that there's also\nanother pattern here, too.\n\n404\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.280\nAnd I marked it with these double\nasterisks, because I don't have\n\n405\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.250\nthe ability to change colors with Notepad.\n&gt;&gt; Damn shame.\n\n406\n00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.463\n&gt;&gt; But I want to keep it simple as\n\n407\n00:19:09.463 --> 00:19:09.975\npossible.\n\n408\n00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:14.571\nSo 128 appears in this 4, right,\nin that the intervals of 4, okay,\n\n409\n00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:16.659\npoint to point networks, okay.\n\n410\n00:19:16.659 --> 00:19:22.297\nNotice that down here in the 8s,\n128 appears here, too.\n\n411\n00:19:22.297 --> 00:19:26.906\nNotice at 16, 128 also, appears.\n\n412\n00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:31.705\n32, the 128 also appears here too.\n&gt;&gt; It's in every one of these.\n\n413\n00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.560\n&gt;&gt; It's in every single one of these,\n\n414\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.950\nnow you're going Ronnie, so\nwhat, what's the big deal?\n\n415\n00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:42.100\nOkay, what if I'm given the number\nabove 128 and one of these numbers?\n\n416\n00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.829\nI don't have to start at 0, 4, 0,\n\n417\n00:19:45.829 --> 00:19:49.080\n4, 8, 12.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can start with 128 as your\n\n418\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.297\nbase and work from there.\n&gt;&gt; Even with a 4,\n\n419\n00:19:52.297 --> 00:19:55.570\nright, I can start there, 132, 136.\n\n420\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:01.731\nThen I'm given 147, okay, well then I\nknow that's not an ordinary number but\n\n421\n00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:06.750\nthe network number before it,\nit's in between 144, 148.\n\n422\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.690\nSo now you have this kind of method\nwhere you're picking up halfway through.\n\n423\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.947\nSo any time, right,\nit's a higher number than 128.\n\n424\n00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:16.040\nYou go, I'm just gonna start with 128.\n\n425\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.110\nThe interval is 16 from there.\n\n426\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.450\nWell then I know 128 plus 16,\nthat's 144, okay?\n\n427\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.237\nAnd then you move from there.\n\n428\n00:20:23.237 --> 00:20:28.980\n160, 176, 192, then, you don't\nhave to go all the way back to 0.\n\n429\n00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.270\nCrap, I've got to count all\nthe way back from 0 again.\n\n430\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.857\nSo Daniel,\n\n431\n00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:36.630\nwe have now actually given not only some\nof the stuff we can easily memorize.\n\n432\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.773\nThose two digit ones,\n\n433\n00:20:37.773 --> 00:20:40.568\nwe're good, and single digits, hopefully.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n434\n00:20:40.568 --> 00:20:43.281\nNot making any promises.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not going to make any\n\n435\n00:20:43.281 --> 00:20:44.141\npromises.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:20:44.141 --> 00:20:46.443\n&gt;&gt; But single digits, we're pretty good,\n\n437\n00:20:46.443 --> 00:20:49.551\nnow two digits, okay.\n&gt;&gt; I can count to potato.\n\n438\n00:20:49.551 --> 00:20:52.093\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once you get up to three digits,\n\n439\n00:20:52.093 --> 00:20:55.040\nthat's when it becomes\nmuch more challenging.\n\n440\n00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.910\nBut now I've given you a hint.\n\n441\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.691\nYou know that if it's a number higher than\n128, where am I gonna begin counting?\n\n442\n00:21:00.691 --> 00:21:01.365\n&gt;&gt; 128.\n\n443\n00:21:01.365 --> 00:21:04.490\n&gt;&gt; 128, then if I go, all right, 128.\n\n444\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.651\nHere's my action octet, it's 224.\n\n445\n00:21:07.651 --> 00:21:11.500\nAnd then 128 plus that 32 which\nis actually interval there.\n\n446\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.110\nThen you count up and\nyou know it is actually up there.\n\n447\n00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.316\nYou know exactly what\nnetwork it's going to be.\n\n448\n00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:17.632\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, it's a heck of a shortcut,\n\n449\n00:21:17.632 --> 00:21:18.615\nI got to be honest with you.\n\n450\n00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:20.469\nYeah it does take a little\nwork on the backend or\n\n451\n00:21:20.469 --> 00:21:23.478\nthe frontend wherever you want to call it,\nhowever you're looking at it.\n\n452\n00:21:23.478 --> 00:21:27.441\nBut once you do this, you're gonna be so\nfast at subnetting that any questions\n\n453\n00:21:27.441 --> 00:21:30.863\nabout subnetting you're just\ngonna be like, cake, cake, cake,\n\n454\n00:21:30.863 --> 00:21:32.200\nI got it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n455\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.730\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna get them right.\n\n456\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.710\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of neat, right.\n\n457\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.800\nSo like I said, I was fast at it.\n\n458\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.000\nAnd then once I installed this a couple of\ntimes, all of the sudden it was easy for\n\n459\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.990\nme to actually kind of look at an IP\naddress, look quickly at the subnet mask.\n\n460\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.660\nNow here's the key, right?\n\n461\n00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.770\nIs that that's why we also need to,\nwhere did my slider thing went,\n\n462\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.040\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n&gt;&gt; Where are you slider?\n\n463\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.820\n&gt;&gt; It was not in my list there.\n\n464\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.590\nOnce we have this down,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n465\n00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.760\nThey give me, what,\na slash notation, right?\n\n466\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.351\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n467\n00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:05.865\n&gt;&gt; Or if they give me the subnet mask,\n\n468\n00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:07.550\nI just to need to know that converter.\n\n469\n00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.710\nSo that's kinda the slower step, right?\n\n470\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.940\nCrap, it's giving me a slash 22,\nwhat the heck is a slash 22 at this point?\n\n471\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.530\nThat's what you've got to convert, and\nthen now you've got the action octet,\n\n472\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.790\nfrom there you can move forward, okay?\n\n473\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.982\nBut that's why the memory, right, so\nif you can do something like this.\n\n474\n00:22:22.982 --> 00:22:26.131\nAnd when I was talking to Todd about\nthis and he was talking how he,\n\n475\n00:22:26.131 --> 00:22:29.240\nit's like he was trying to figure\nout a faster way to teach this.\n\n476\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.060\nAnd all of a sudden one night he sat in\nhis hotel room and he started doing this.\n\n477\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.690\nHe said he did it 15 times in a row and\nthen did it 50 times in a row,\n\n478\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.910\nand he was like, holy moly, it worked.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n479\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.500\n&gt;&gt; It continues to work.\n\n480\n00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:46.430\nSo now, Daniel, as far as what we've,\nand for our ITProTV viewers, right?\n\n481\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.442\nHopefully, if the fundamentals really\nmake sense on why you're doing\n\n482\n00:22:51.442 --> 00:22:52.537\nsubnetting, okay.\n\n483\n00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:55.760\nNow you've already done it, and\nyou go, I know how to subnet.\n\n484\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.210\nThat's why learning this\nmethod now makes sense.\n\n485\n00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.610\nDaniel, if I were to just\ngive you this number and\n\n486\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.158\nyou didn't know anything about the subnet,\nright?\n\n487\n00:23:02.158 --> 00:23:05.890\nJust take 256 and subtract that and\nthat'll give you your network interval.\n\n488\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.160\nOkay, then what's\nthe network interval again?\n\n489\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n490\n00:23:10.565 --> 00:23:12.110\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n491\n00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.580\nthat's where you have to slow down and\nyou have to learn it.\n\n492\n00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.960\nBut now that we've gone through all the\nfundamentals, Daniel would you say that if\n\n493\n00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.320\nyou were to learn something,\njust those two methods we just showed you.\n\n494\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.050\nReally some of it's just\nrepeating patterns, right, and\n\n495\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.920\nthen knowing those shortcuts.\n\n496\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.403\nWould you think now, being able to\nanswer a subnetting question within\n\n497\n00:23:30.403 --> 00:23:33.659\na minute is very possible?\n&gt;&gt; It's extremely possible,\n\n498\n00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:36.550\nthat minute would be plenty of time for\nyou.\n\n499\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.612\nIf you've done the homework here that\nRonnie has given you with these examples,\n\n500\n00:23:40.612 --> 00:23:43.672\nbuild those foundations, and\nthen learn those shortcuts.\n\n501\n00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:47.093\nYou'll be able to crank these\nquestions out without a problem,\n\n502\n00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:51.333\nwhich is gonna be great for you by saving\nyou time there, puts time in the bank for\n\n503\n00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:53.448\nlater questions that you need them on.\n\n504\n00:23:53.448 --> 00:23:55.283\nSo that you can do a little\nmore comprehension, and\n\n505\n00:23:55.283 --> 00:23:58.125\ntry to figure out where they're trying\nto maybe trick you or that kinda stuff.\n\n506\n00:23:58.125 --> 00:23:59.575\nYou know how it is, they get this.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n507\n00:23:59.575 --> 00:24:01.045\n&gt;&gt; So that's gonna be\n\n508\n00:24:01.045 --> 00:24:01.705\nreally good\n\n509\n00:24:03.337 --> 00:24:04.287\n&gt;&gt; Investment-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n510\n00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:05.692\n&gt;&gt; Over time for the exam.\n\n511\n00:24:05.692 --> 00:24:07.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's no doubt Daniel,\n\n512\n00:24:07.656 --> 00:24:12.587\nthat this is kind of the easiest way that\nI know how to get you ready for the exam.\n\n513\n00:24:12.587 --> 00:24:15.897\nBut it has to come with that practice and\nthat hard work first.\n\n514\n00:24:15.897 --> 00:24:19.004\nIf you don't do that and\nspend the time to learn it,\n\n515\n00:24:19.004 --> 00:24:21.986\nthe tricks may help you\nif you can remember them.\n\n516\n00:24:21.986 --> 00:24:24.462\nBut they're not gonna help you\nif you don't know what the other\n\n517\n00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:25.780\nelements are about.\n\n518\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.650\nAnd if you can't determine what the\nnetwork ID is, and if you can't determine\n\n519\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.870\nwhat the broadcast ID is, then you're\ngonna miss some questions just on that.\n\n520\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.750\nEven if you can do those simple\nmethods that we just showed you.\n\n521\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.787\nSo by condensing all those other things\nthat we took a long time of doing.\n\n522\n00:24:39.787 --> 00:24:43.754\nWe showed you where Daniel was able\nto just randomly type that in.\n\n523\n00:24:43.754 --> 00:24:47.446\nAnd then I was like all right,\nhere is the broadcast ID, range and\n\n524\n00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:48.600\nas well as network.\n\n525\n00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.035\nCuz he already saw how it was done and\nhe already knew how to do it, but\n\n526\n00:24:52.035 --> 00:24:53.890\nit does help.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know these tricks, though.\n\n527\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.210\n&gt;&gt; But you didn't know these tricks.\n\n528\n00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:00.070\nSo now you can see why it is very\npossible that this can be done.\n\n529\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.860\nSo take the time,\nlearn the basics, all right?\n\n530\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.510\nI know that people go, I don't wanna learn\nthe basics, I just wanna pass the exam.\n\n531\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.140\nPassing the exam is a validation\nof what you've already learned.\n\n532\n00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.830\nIt shouldn't just be about tricks.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n533\n00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.521\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel,\n\n534\n00:25:11.521 --> 00:25:15.399\nhopefully that will help everybody\nkind of get a solid start here.\n\n535\n00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:18.215\nWe're not done yet,\nbecause what we wanna do now is see,\n\n536\n00:25:18.215 --> 00:25:21.230\ncan we really put something\nlike this into practice?\n\n537\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.050\nAnd we are gonna go over some\npossible types of questions\n\n538\n00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.270\nthat you might end up seeing on,\nnot only the Cisco exam for subnetting.\n\n539\n00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.110\nBut just about any exam for\nsubnetting as well.\n\n540\n00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.580\nSo not every single question type, but\na lot of them is what we're gonna see.\n\n541\n00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Ronnie,\n\n542\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.850\ngreat stuff today.\n\n543\n00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.970\nThis right here If you've\nwatched only one episode,\n\n544\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.090\nI don't know why you would do that, but if\nyou did, this would be the one to watch.\n\n545\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.980\nAnd hopefully you've already\ngot the fundamentals down,\n\n546\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.450\nbecause otherwise this isn't\ngonna make a lot of sense to you.\n\n547\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.350\nBut really, really great tricks and tips\nfor getting really fast at subnetting and\n\n548\n00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:59.630\nmaking your peers jealous A, and\nB, that exam a cakewalk for you.\n\n549\n00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.800\nRonnie, thanks so much for this.\n\n550\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.900\nI'm definitely gonna learn these things.\n\n551\n00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.130\nHopefully you do as well so that when you\nsit in that testing booth, you are smoking\n\n552\n00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.800\nany subnetting question that comes out\nof the gate like no problem at all.\n\n553\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.890\nThat being said, we are out of time this\nepisode so we're gonna call it a day.\n\n554\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.360\nBut don't fret,\nwe have more to come in this series.\n\n555\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.890\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n556\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:18.780\n&gt;&gt;

Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.020\nThank you for having me on\nthe show as we continue more and\n\n14\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.970\nmore preparing, preparation.\n\n15\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.380\nPreparing for, of course,\nyour CCNT exam and, of course,\n\n16\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.180\nlearning more about networking.\n\n17\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.730\nNow in previous episodes,\nup and to this point,\n\n18\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.380\nwe've gone into IP addressing, right?\n\n19\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.579\nAnd then in IP addressing,\nwe pretty much spent the majority of that,\n\n20\n00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.870\nif not everything, in IP version 4.\n\n21\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.900\nSo we've gone through\nthe history of IP version 4.\n\n22\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.490\nWe've showed you how those\naddresses are formed.\n\n23\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.840\nWe've taken you through so much,\nsome of the different types of addresses.\n\n24\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.400\nWe've even conquered that weird\ntopic that most people go, my gosh,\n\n25\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.950\nI can't believe I didn't learn it,\nsubnetting, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.767\nSo we've actually done all that,\nand we did mention that IPv6,\n\n27\n00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:15.796\nokay, which is the topic\nthat we're covering today,\n\n28\n00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:19.970\nis really a replacement for\nIP version 4, right?\n\n29\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.080\nRemember that there's\nproblems with IP version 4,\n\n30\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020\nlet's make sure that we\nhit that point once again.\n\n31\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.880\nAnd some of the problems with IP\nversion 4, of course, really the major\n\n32\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.510\nproblem with it is that there's just not\nenough addresses in the address pool.\n\n33\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.153\nSo even though there are around\n4.3 billion possible IP version 4\n\n34\n00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:42.556\naddresses that are available,\nwell, several things, right,\n\n35\n00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:47.699\nover the history of IP version 4 while\nit's been in use have really robbed.\n\n36\n00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:52.710\nI shouldn't say robbed, but\nreduced that pool of numbers very quickly.\n\n37\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.120\nSo we've talked about class pool,\n\n38\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.410\nnature of the way that they started\ndividing up these addresses.\n\n39\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.350\nAnd then we also took a look at some of\nthe special addresses that were out there\n\n40\n00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.090\nsuch as private IP addresses and\nRFC 1918, and even the loopback address.\n\n41\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.570\nTaking away millions of\naddresses right away, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.040\nSo all of that made the pool\nof addresses even smaller.\n\n43\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.130\nAnd of course, once those addresses\nwere assigned out there or\n\n44\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.750\nessentially leased out there,\nthey don't get to be subleased again.\n\n45\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.910\nYou just have that pool and there it is.\n\n46\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.320\nYou're off and ready to go.\n\n47\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.500\nSo at some point, once they realized how\nquickly these addresses were disappearing,\n\n48\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.510\nwe then talked about the kind of\nway that they slowed down, right?\n\n49\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.450\nThe variable length subnet masking\nwhich is why we got into subnetting.\n\n50\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.220\nWe talked about network\naddress translation,\n\n51\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.982\nwhich we haven't gotten\ninto in this series.\n\n52\n00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:43.750\nBut we'll definitely be covering it by\nthe time we hit all of the CCNA series\n\n53\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.010\nif we don't cover it inside of CCNT here,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.530\nAnd of course, we also want to actually\ntalk about, well, the idea and\n\n55\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.430\nthe combination of things, right?\n\n56\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.860\nThe very fact of using private IP\naddresses on the variable link subnet\n\n57\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.040\nmasking and that,\nthose were kind of stop gap measures\n\n58\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.750\nthat slowed down the depletion of\nthose addresses very quickly for us.\n\n59\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.660\nBecause we could start breaking the rules\nto the way things ended up working but\n\n60\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.120\nthere was always gonna ultimately\nbe a replacement, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.260\nSomething that would actually\nhave to come along and\n\n62\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.050\nreplace the pool of addresses that we had.\n\n63\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.630\nThere's always these questions like, why\ndidn't they just extend the pool, right?\n\n64\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.780\nSo why didn't they just change the pool,\nand continue on?\n\n65\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.770\nWell, a lot of things actually influence,\ngive us these kind of factors and\n\n66\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.040\ninfluences, right?\n\n67\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.160\nOne is fairly simple that once\nyou get to the idea of hardware,\n\n68\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.320\nor software and hardware, right, and\nhow things are reported in the software.\n\n69\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.120\nIf they said look, all we're gonna use\nat the beginning when they started\n\n70\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.910\nprogramming software,\nis gonna be 32-bit addressing, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.010\nSo even when you take a look at something\nlike that, they actually have to program\n\n72\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.400\nthat field and\nthat size to keep the limitation there.\n\n73\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.700\nSo one of the examples that you will end\nup seeing, for example, in the world of\n\n74\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.640\nCisco, is that when you go and you try and\nfind out the IP address on an interface,\n\n75\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.970\nthe majority of the time, there's\na limited space for that interface and for\n\n76\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.735\nthe IP address, which is normally\nabout 15 characters altogether.\n\n77\n00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:13.840\nBut once you go beyond that, right,\nit doesn't know what to do with it.\n\n78\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.940\nAnd it will probably just drop it as\nif you don't know anything about it.\n\n79\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.000\nSo they'd have to go back and\n\n80\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.370\nretool every single thing that\nthey've done to make it that way.\n\n81\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.508\nSo instead they said, look,\nit's gonna end up getting replaced, so\n\n82\n00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:28.032\nwe're going to give it some time for\nthat replacement.\n\n83\n00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:32.660\nIt's gonna be a transition time that\nwe have to actually be able to do, and\n\n84\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.470\nthat way we'll give them, everybody,\nplenty of time to catch up.\n\n85\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.160\nSo there is no way to just go,\none day we're gonna use this, and\n\n86\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.330\nthen next day we're not going to use it.\n\n87\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.137\nSo that's why we're finally now\nstarting to talk about IP version 6.\n\n88\n00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:48.840\nNow IP version 6 has been around for\nactually quite a while.\n\n89\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.610\nFor the majority of its early history,\nokay, it continued to change\n\n90\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.070\nin the way that things\nactually ended up working.\n\n91\n00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.550\nSo it was relatively volatile.\n\n92\n00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.047\nYou'd have different types of addresses\nand today those addresses have some of\n\n93\n00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:07.610\nthe different ones that you might still\nread about like site-local addresses.\n\n94\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.140\nThose have kinda disappeared.\n\n95\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.768\nAnd some of these other really\nspecial types of addresses have\n\n96\n00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:12.736\ndisappeared as well.\n\n97\n00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:15.435\nSo all that has changed and\nis now relatively stable and\n\n98\n00:05:15.435 --> 00:05:19.482\nhas been so probably for about three or\nfour, maybe even five years at this point,\n\n99\n00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:21.870\nwhere everything is kinda calmed down.\n\n100\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.270\nEverything is stable.\n\n101\n00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.510\nAnd then companies and,\n\n102\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.770\nof course, Internet service providers\nstarting adopting it and pushing it out.\n\n103\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.770\nAnd there became a day where they called\nit the IP version 6 transition time that\n\n104\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.530\neverybody on the Internet was supposed\nto flip over to which actually did help\n\n105\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.920\nto start stem things doing\nwhat they needed to, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.195\nBut all that's actually in\nplay when we start talking\n\n107\n00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:46.700\nabout the idea of why we want\nto understand IP version 6.\n\n108\n00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.220\nThere is no doubt about it that even\nif your company's using IP version 4,\n\n109\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.230\nright now there probably is,\nas you get hired into the workforce,\n\n110\n00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.710\nif you're not already there, that you're\ngonna have to learn IP version 6.\n\n111\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.910\nAnd more than likely in the next few\nyears, you're gonna be transitioning over.\n\n112\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.752\nI remember when I first\nstarted teaching Cisco,\n\n113\n00:06:04.752 --> 00:06:08.050\nwe were like, it's still in the future\nwhere companies are gonna transition.\n\n114\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.490\nCompanies are transitioning every day now,\nokay?\n\n115\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.190\nThey're starting to move towards it.\n\n116\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.210\nSo you are gonna see that and that's\nactually gonna be very helpful for us.\n\n117\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.220\nBecause one of the things that it does,\nthe primary thing,\n\n118\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.770\nis that it actually increases that\naddress pool in the way that we need to.\n\n119\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.920\nTo what is, at least for us at this\npoint practically unlimited, not\n\n120\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.560\ntheoretically unlimited, but practically\nunlimited in terms of the address pool.\n\n121\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.960\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat we're talking about,\n\n122\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.340\nand then we'll talk about some other\nthings that IP version 6 addresses\n\n123\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.400\nalso help us do.\n\n124\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.660\nOkay, so\nhere on my screen I've used this and\n\n125\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.120\nI've added a little bit of\ninformation to it, right?\n\n126\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.730\nThe pool of valid IP address actually\ngoes from this number right here,\n\n127\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.550\nabout 4.3 billion addresses to this\nnumber, okay, which I'm pretty sure that\n\n128\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.520\nsomebody out here could actually pronounce\nwhatever that number actually is.\n\n129\n00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.170\nBut I don't remember all of these, right?\n\n130\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.543\nSo I could get up to the millions\nat some point which would be,\n\n131\n00:07:03.543 --> 00:07:05.605\nI'm assuming right in here, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:10.840\nBut after that, 100 million,\nno this is billions, then trillions.\n\n133\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.720\nAnd then once you start getting here to\nafter trillions, it's, I don't know, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.030\nSo I'm pretty sure it's another number,\nexa, peda, I don't know, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.928\nBut then once you get past that, right,\nI don't have a clue what this is, this is,\n\n136\n00:07:22.928 --> 00:07:23.957\nthis is, or this is.\n\n137\n00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:24.757\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Zillions.\n\n138\n00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:25.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, zillions.\n\n139\n00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:26.271\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:26.771\n&gt;&gt; Gazillions.\n\n141\n00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:28.601\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a gazillion, right?\n\n142\n00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:30.821\n&gt;&gt; I think that's the 14 commas,\n\n143\n00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.941\nis a gazillion.\n&gt;&gt; So somewhere along the line,\n\n144\n00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:36.151\nyou know gazillion is, I mean, I might\nas well, it's a cartoon character saying\n\n145\n00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.781\nthat stuff so it might as well be that.\nBut that's how big this pool of numbers\n\n146\n00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:43.201\nactually is.\nSo when you start taking a look at that,\n\n147\n00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:47.231\nyou start to realize that now\nit's practically unlimited here,\n\n148\n00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:48.101\nokay?\nSo\n\n149\n00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.880\nthis is actually pretty much\nthe big thing that it does.\n\n150\n00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.170\nNow there is some other things in why you\nwant your company to start moving to IP\n\n151\n00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.691\nversion 6 as well, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:57.691 --> 00:08:02.615\nIP version 4, it was designed to help\npackets get transmitted from one place to\n\n153\n00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:03.798\nanother, right?\n\n154\n00:08:03.798 --> 00:08:07.717\nSource to destination, but it didn't have\neverything else in mind because it didn't\n\n155\n00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:10.930\nrecognize what the future of\nthe Internet would look like.\n\n156\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.710\nIt didn't account for things like Daniel\nwould be out there hacking and sniffing\n\n157\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.290\ntraffic, and being able to actually\npull the information and doing that.\n\n158\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.710\nSo it didn't account for other things.\n\n159\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.970\nSo what started to happen is once\nsomeone like Daniel coming along and\n\n160\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.600\ndoing that stuff, right?\n\n161\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.050\nIn IP version 4,\nsecurity was not built into it.\n\n162\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.190\nNow, that doesn't mean that it\nactually is automatically secure,\n\n163\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.480\nbut what it means at least for active\n4 you had to add a layer on top of it.\n\n164\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.090\nSo if you had to actually\nmake that address secure.\n\n165\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.940\nThere is nothing inherent about it\nthat's actually secure in IP version 6,\n\n166\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.110\nit is built in.\n\n167\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.380\nNow, it doesn't mean\nthat you have to use it.\n\n168\n00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.110\nBut it means that they said,\nthis portion of bits here.\n\n169\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.030\nWe're gonna use for the additional\nsecurity that we want, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.330\nWhy?\nBecause that address pool is so big,\n\n171\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.120\nyou can use whatever you want to.\n\n172\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.810\nBut that's what they did.\n\n173\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.380\nThey added in those things.\n\n174\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.010\nThey allowed us to actually do some things\nwhich is also because of the address pool\n\n175\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.060\nbeing so big and\nall the addresses that we need being so\n\n176\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.590\nroutable as well, you no longer need\nthings like network address translations.\n\n177\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.740\nSo things that would break with nap\nyou don't have to worry about with\n\n178\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.880\nIP version 6.\n\n179\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.600\nOkay?\n\n180\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.960\nYou actually don't have\nto do anything on that.\n\n181\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.740\nYou don't even need private IP addresses.\n\n182\n00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.620\nNow, when I say that,\n\n183\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.200\npeople were like, well how the heck\nyou use the internet then?\n\n184\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.940\nYou actually will have\nan IP version 6 address\n\n185\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.760\non your machine that will be routable,\nokay?\n\n186\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.870\nIt will actually end up working, but you\ndon't have to worry about stuff like that.\n\n187\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.670\nSo is the strange, you know combination\nof different things in which\n\n188\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.270\nshows us the value of IP version 6.\n\n189\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.920\nNow, at its heart though, Daniel,\nit is still binary, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.020\nSo don't think it's something magical or\na different language,\n\n191\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.670\nit's still binary as heart.\n\n192\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.520\nBut this time, instead of reporting\nit in dotted decimal notation, okay?\n\n193\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.299\nIn IPv6,\nbecause it'll be 128 ones and zeroes.\n\n194\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.730\nYeah, I can't even imagine\nopening up a Windows machine and\n\n195\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.890\ngoing to type in an address and\ngoing all right.\n\n196\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.050\nEach one of those has a dot in between.\n\n197\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.280\nYou know how they do it in Windows here.\n\n198\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.460\nYou'd have to actually\nhave a field that big?\n\n199\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.180\nYes you would.\n\n200\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.310\nYou'd have a field that big if\nyou decided that you wanted your\n\n201\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.860\nDNS server to have a static IP address.\n\n202\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.840\nYou'd have to type in some number\nthat was something that looked very\n\n203\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.890\nsimilar to this.\n\n204\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.080\nYou know to make that work.\n\n205\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.070\nSo they realize that they could\nshorten this address in another way.\n\n206\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.840\nIf they were to do this in\ndotted decimal notation,\n\n207\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.360\nit would turn out to be 16 octets, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.800\nThat's what it would turn out to be,\n16 octets.\n\n209\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.980\nSo they reduced it by instead saying we're\ngonna report this in hexidecimal instead.\n\n210\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.360\nHexidecimal is a base 16 number.\n\n211\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.960\nNow we've already talked about\nbinary which is a base 2, 1 and 0s.\n\n212\n00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.218\nYou and\nI know decimal numbering system, okay,\n\n213\n00:11:00.218 --> 00:11:04.330\nzero through nine, that gives us 10\npossible digits that we can use.\n\n214\n00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.930\nIn hexadecimal, with a single digit,\n\n215\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.260\nwe can actually have 16\ndifferent combinations.\n\n216\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.510\nAnd that goes from the number\nzero through nine and\n\n217\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.820\nthe letters A through F in\nthe English alphabet, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.860\nSo that's what happens.\n\n219\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.750\nSo after you get to nine to go\nto 10 actually is an a, and\n\n220\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:28.080\nthen 11 would be b, and of course 12,\nc, 13, d, 14, e, and then 15, f.\n\n221\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.540\nI wanna make sure I actually said that\nright cuz I can get confused when I'm\n\n222\n00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.570\ntrying to say that.\n\n223\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.060\nSo you should see that and\nyou should know that.\n\n224\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.960\nNow, what did that do in\nterms of shortening and\n\n225\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.970\nhelping us out in reporting this address.\n\n226\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.700\nWell it changed it instead,\nto essentially eight 16 bit sections.\n\n227\n00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.820\nBut when we start reporting it then,\n\n228\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:57.030\nin hexidecimal fashion, each one of\nthese as you see this example, and\n\n229\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.840\nI made this IP version 6 address\nup in my head is what I did, so\n\n230\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.980\ndon't take this as being a very awesome\nexample of a true IP Version 6 address.\n\n231\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:14.190\nBut each one of these characters here\nequals to four bits is what it does.\n\n232\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:20.060\nSo this hexadecimal 2 here, if you were\nto change it to binary it would be 0010.\n\n233\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.250\nSo that's what you would\nactually end up seeing.\n\n234\n00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.670\nThe same thing with the zero here.\n\n235\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.750\nIt would be four zeros in a row,\nfour zeros in a row.\n\n236\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.050\nThree zeros and a one if you\nwere to change this to binary.\n\n237\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.760\nAnd then you actually\nmultiply that times four.\n\n238\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.100\nWell four times four is 16.\n\n239\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.550\nSo in between the colons here\n\n240\n00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.430\nyou have 16 bits is what you\nwould actually really have.\n\n241\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.260\nIn place, and we'll see this\na little bit later on in our little\n\n242\n00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.560\nmini series here on IP version 6.\n\n243\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.460\nNow the reason why this is actually\nimportant is because this is the standard\n\n244\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.210\nformat of what an IP version\n6 address looks like, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.320\nNow Daniel, the first time that I started\nreally trying to learn about this and\n\n246\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.570\nget through this,\nIt wasn't because of Cisco.\n\n247\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.770\nI was actually preparing for\nanother certification exam.\n\n248\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.010\nAnd I started going, why do they\nkeep writing that it, it's shorter,\n\n249\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:14.020\nit's really a lot shorter and\npeople will start, you know, doing this.\n\n250\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.990\nWell, it's because that they did\nactually start to do this and\n\n251\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.030\neven though it's eight sections long.\n\n252\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.960\nBy comparison it is shorter but they also\nof course more actually able to do things\n\n253\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.510\nthat actually allow it to be\na little bit shorter as well.\n\n254\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.790\nWe need to talk about that fact or two.\n\n255\n00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.670\nNow it still divides up into what\nwe saw on the IP version 4 just\n\n256\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.360\nas a certain number of those 128 bits now,\nokay.\n\n257\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.250\nAre gonna be your network ID.\n\n258\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.090\nAnd instead they don't call\na host ID anymore, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.790\nBut the second portion is\ngonna be an interface ID.\n\n260\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.770\nNow Daniel this is important\nan distinction for us.\n\n261\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.430\nOkay?\n\n262\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.141\nSo when we look in the IP version for\naddress, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:54.141 --> 00:13:58.930\nThe reason why we have an IP address and\nwe call a host ID,\n\n264\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.090\nIt is because that IP address normally\nrepresents that entire machine,\n\n265\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.050\npretty much, okay,\nis what it normally represents.\n\n266\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.700\nNow, you have multiple interfaces.\n\n267\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.640\nIn other words, you got two or three\nnetwork adaptors on your machine, but\n\n268\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.270\nyou can have a different IP\naddress on each one of those.\n\n269\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.110\nAnd in reality,\n\n270\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.170\nyou can actually put multiple IP\naddresses on that same adaptor as well.\n\n271\n00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.100\nBut here,\nthey're already accounting for that.\n\n272\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.020\nThey're saying, look.\n\n273\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:24.980\nLet's call it what it is.\n\n274\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.140\nIt's an InterfaceID.\n\n275\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.540\nSo every nick that you have, you can use\nan address like this to ID that address.\n\n276\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.210\nAnd the same thing your gonna find out\nwhich is something else that's gonna be\n\n277\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:40.650\nneat for IP Version 6,\nis that multiple IP Version 6 addresses\n\n278\n00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.970\nare gonna be attached to your machine and\nto your interfaces.\n\n279\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.880\nSome of them are gonna be for\ndifferent types of traffic.\n\n280\n00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.640\nOthers of them of course will actually\nbe because you are actually using\n\n281\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.230\nmultiple types of these addresses\nto help you to communicate and\n\n282\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.360\ndo some other things too okay?\n\n283\n00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.010\nNow of all the things Daniel\nas strange as this looks and\n\n284\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.850\nI'm leaving this up here on purpose okay,\nI wanna point out the most important\n\n285\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.310\nelement of this okay which\nis gonna be strange for us.\n\n286\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.396\nIt's actually this number after the slash.\n\n287\n00:15:12.396 --> 00:15:14.240\n[LAUGH] That is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n288\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.330\nLooks like a subnet mask.\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n289\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Imitation\n\n290\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.470\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does.\n\n291\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.674\nIt looks like a cybernotation which\nwe talked about in IP version\n\n292\n00:15:20.674 --> 00:15:24.650\nfour a little bit, right that\nclassless inter-domain routing here.\n\n293\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.080\nAnd it works in the same way but\nthey call it the prefix link.\n\n294\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.260\nAnd the reason I wanted to point this out\nis because it's address is so big anymore.\n\n295\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.000\nWe don't even have to do\nsub-netting ever again.\n\n296\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.645\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n297\n00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:42.198\nWhich you'll still probably do.\n\n298\n00:15:42.198 --> 00:15:44.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You really don't.\n\n299\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.840\nIn all practicality, you do not.\n\n300\n00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.310\nNow the only time you would ever do\nsomething, you can go out there and see.\n\n301\n00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.380\nPeople will subnet IP version 6,\ndon't know why.\n\n302\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.182\n&gt;&gt; For some strange reason.\n\n303\n00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:55.432\n&gt;&gt; For some strange reason, but\n\n304\n00:15:55.432 --> 00:15:56.533\nthey have a reason for it.\n\n305\n00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:01.558\nIn other words, you wanna control how\nthis address pool is So like Daniel says,\n\n306\n00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:05.608\nI want to make that all of my\naddresses are sequential in number,\n\n307\n00:16:05.608 --> 00:16:06.450\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.960\n&gt;&gt; If Daniel wanted that,\n\n309\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.690\nyes he could subnet, and\n\n310\n00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:14.880\nthen he'd have go and either, do a DHCP\nserver that would actually do that.\n\n311\n00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.830\nOr he would have to statically\ndo every single one of these.\n\n312\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.840\nWhich I would find it a little bit insane,\nbut\n\n313\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.160\nthis is okay with me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n314\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.855\n&gt;&gt; But if you wanted to, it could be done,\n\n315\n00:16:23.855 --> 00:16:26.568\nso you can do subnetting if you want to.\n\n316\n00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:28.950\nBut in all reality, you and I-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] right.\n\n317\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.260\n&gt;&gt; Don't, there is just no real need for\n\n318\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.350\nit anymore.\n\n319\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.420\nThey don't even care,\nthey're saying look, don't.\n\n320\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.970\nThey're actually even encouraging,\ndon't be too stingy with the numbers.\n\n321\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.710\nThat's how big this pool is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n322\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Daniel,\n\n323\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.150\nI'm gonna give you an IP address and\n\n324\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.590\nit's gonna have more addresses in it\nthan the current pool of the Internet.\n\n325\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.220\nSounds cool, doesn't it, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.300\n&gt;&gt; So if you do that,\n\n327\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.180\nyou don't have to go,\nI better only hand out ten of these, okay.\n\n328\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.640\nOr just five,\nI don't wanna waste the pool, [LAUGH].\n\n329\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.740\nSo they actually do something like\nthat where they're saying, so\n\n330\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.340\nwhat if that one address ends\nup getting 10,000 IP addresses.\n\n331\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.120\nDo they really, no,\nthat's how big this number actually is.\n\n332\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.160\nIt is amazing that you could do\nsomething like that and go, 10,000,\n\n333\n00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.370\nyes, if you wanted to it literally could\nbe something like that you chose it.\n\n334\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.510\nBut this number is important,\n\n335\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.860\nbecause this is kind of a really\nstandard number here which is /64.\n\n336\n00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.330\nNow what I mean by that, is that when\nwe start talking about routing okay,\n\n337\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.610\nmost of the routes are actually\ngoing to end in this.\n\n338\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.670\nWhich means the first 64\nbits of this address,\n\n339\n00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.990\nwhich happen to fall right in line with\nhalf of the address here, okay right.\n\n340\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.340\nIf this is 128 bits all the way across,\nthe eight different sections of\n\n341\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.060\nhexadecimal, well here it is,\none, two, three, four.\n\n342\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.780\nWell, that's when you actually start doing\nthat, you start taking a look at that.\n\n343\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.780\nThe four times 16, that is gonna give you\n64, so you normally actually just put\n\n344\n00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.100\nthe prefix link there, and\nthat represents your network ID, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.670\nSo that's gonna be standard\njust about everywhere.\n\n346\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.340\nIf you start seeing different\nnumbers greater than that, so\n\n347\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:12.718\nsomething like a /96, or,\n124 whatever it might be.\n\n348\n00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:19.031\nSomebody's doing subnetting for you,\nit's probably not gonna be your ISPs.\n\n349\n00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:22.560\nSomebody else is saying, I want to\ncontrol this address space, okay.\n\n350\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.110\nSo that's what you're seeing, and\nthat's why I wanted to point that out.\n\n351\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.320\nBecause if there's anything that we don't\nwant to actually try and do at this point,\n\n352\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.740\nif you haven't learned hexadecimal\nnumbering, subnetting in hexadecimal.\n\n353\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.790\nIt works the same way as it does in\nthe binary that we talked about,\n\n354\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.790\nexcept that you have to do it\nwith hexadecimal numbers instead.\n\n355\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.330\nWhich gets a little bit stranger\nbecause if you think about it, okay.\n\n356\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.410\nYou're actually now having\nto add in letters and\n\n357\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.590\nnumbers to give you\nthe division that you want to.\n\n358\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.420\nAnd that begins to kind of twist\nthe mind a little bit harder,\n\n359\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.000\nto where you start squinting, and\nthen having that one vein kinda throb\n\n360\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.110\nin your head.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.790\n&gt;&gt; As you go, I don't\n\n362\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.100\nunderstand what's going on here, okay?\n\n363\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.040\nNow, along with this to show you how\nshort this address can get, right?\n\n364\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.050\nCuz in all practical reality Daniel,\nto you and\n\n365\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.860\nme, I hope that this address\nactually looks to you like,\n\n366\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.425\nthat's insanely long.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n367\n00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:13.717\nit looks a little overwhelming.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n368\n00:19:13.717 --> 00:19:14.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.210\n&gt;&gt; It does look a little bit overwhelming\n\n370\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.290\nin that sense.\n\n371\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.100\nSo they've done exactly what every\nother numbering system has also done.\n\n372\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.340\nAnd I'm gonna take this address and\ncopy it down here for\n\n373\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.010\na moment,\nto help to shorten up this address.\n\n374\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.520\nSo one of the things that they said\nthat you could begin to do, right?\n\n375\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.665\nIt's just like every numbering system,\nyou can reduce the address size\n\n376\n00:19:38.665 --> 00:19:42.815\nby taking off leading zeroes\nin each section, okay.\n\n377\n00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:45.375\nSo we take a look at this\naddress right here, okay?\n\n378\n00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:48.985\nI see the first section,\nI can't take the numbers in between.\n\n379\n00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:52.885\nBecause that would actually make\na difference in what would be outputted\n\n380\n00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:53.535\nhere, okay.\n\n381\n00:19:53.535 --> 00:19:57.938\nBut I can go and\nnow in this third octet here,\n\n382\n00:19:57.938 --> 00:20:03.010\nI can take this and\nreduce it by the leading zero.\n\n383\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.110\nYou might go what's the big deal?\n\n384\n00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.160\nI know, it doesn't seem like\na big deal at this point, but\n\n385\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.340\nyeah, I know let's continue to move on.\n\n386\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.550\nAnd here it is, another one that has a\nleading zero we can also reduce that one.\n\n387\n00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.030\nAnd then this one here-\n&gt;&gt; That's two leading zeroes.\n\n388\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.580\n&gt;&gt; That might have leading zeroes that we\n\n389\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.820\ncan do that as well.\n\n390\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.530\nSo in other words even if\nthe place holder is just a zero.\n\n391\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.120\nNow I didn't do this one for a reason,\nbecause we're going to use that for\n\n392\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.800\nsomething else in a moment.\n\n393\n00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.080\nBut even this one here actually I should,\nlet me do that.\n\n394\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.410\nLet me lie to you, and not do that.\n\n395\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.250\nLet me do this, okay.\n\n396\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.790\nSo if you actually do have those\nleading zeroes you can remove them.\n\n397\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.640\nLet's just do it that way.\n\n398\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.500\nI was going to do it one at a time,\nbut let's go ahead and do that.\n\n399\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.650\nAll right so now Daniel if we compare\nthis address to the one above it,\n\n400\n00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.338\nit is starting to reduce its size.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, much shorter already at\n\n401\n00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:55.489\nthis point in time.\n&gt;&gt; Yep much shorter already and\n\n402\n00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:57.450\nnow you're starting to\nsee like wait a minute.\n\n403\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:02.530\nThis doesn't even like that those,\nfour sections anymore okay?\n\n404\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.870\nWe understand.\n&gt;&gt; One with just D in it\n\n405\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have one with just a D in it.\n\n406\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.280\nYou have two here, and\nthen you have you know three here.\n\n407\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.530\nYou name it,\nit begins to look a little bit stranger.\n\n408\n00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:17.160\nBut the other thing that you can do, just\nlike this third optic, I call it optic.,\n\n409\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.380\nthird 16 bit section,\nthat's probably the easy way to do it.\n\n410\n00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.778\nThird 16-bit section when it's all zeroes,\nokay?\n\n411\n00:21:24.778 --> 00:21:29.560\nWhether it's 16-bits or\nwhether it's actually even more than that,\n\n412\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:36.480\nyou could reduce that entire thing\ninstead to a double colon, okay?\n\n413\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.690\nSo technically this address notation,\nDaniel, even though nobody uses it,\n\n414\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.520\nis actually called hexadecimal,\n\n415\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.990\ndid I say hexadecimal?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n416\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I don't know why it didn't\n\n417\n00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.920\nsound all right, but\nhexadecimal double colon addressing.\n\n418\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.280\n&gt;&gt; Hexadecimal double colon, that sounds-\n\n419\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.869\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who the heck,\n\n420\n00:21:53.869 --> 00:21:55.046\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n421\n00:21:55.046 --> 00:21:57.039\n&gt;&gt; That's [CROSSTALK] hexadecimal,\n\n422\n00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:57.729\nno, yeah.\n\n423\n00:21:57.729 --> 00:22:00.927\nIf anybody ever asks you that question,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n424\n00:22:00.927 --> 00:22:01.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.100\n&gt;&gt; But I learned it because I was like,\n\n426\n00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.130\nno way, there's not.\n\n427\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.460\nThere is a name for it, but\nthat's what it's called.\n\n428\n00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.490\nAnd that's because when you have those\nzeros you can press them all the way down.\n\n429\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:16.850\nSo Daniel if these three sections\nafter the 2001 the ABCD was zeros.\n\n430\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.050\nThe EF zero one was also zeros.\n\n431\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.350\nI could compress them all down and\nit would be represented by this\n\n432\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.040\ndouble colon here as well.\n&gt;&gt; Now you don't make double colons for\n\n433\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.400\neach one, right?\n\n434\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.960\nIt's just that one set of double\ncolons that there's a contiguous\n\n435\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.480\nset of leading zeros.\n&gt;&gt; Right, Yeah, and\n\n436\n00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.200\nthat actually brings up a good poitn, Dan.\n\n437\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.930\nIt can only appear one time\nin IP version six address.\n\n438\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.310\nSo in this set,\n\n439\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.820\nyou should only see a double colon\nin one time here, in this address.\n\n440\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.820\nNow, what if you go- Like I did, okay.\n\n441\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.030\nSo what if I actually had this FF here,\nand\n\n442\n00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.717\nit also had that string of zeroes,\nwhere it like this instead, okay.\n\n443\n00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.180\nWell, you would reduce that one down, but\n\n444\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.720\nyou would actually reduce\nit down to having one zero.\n\n445\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.970\nYou can't get rid and\ndo a double colon for both of them.\n\n446\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.610\nBut this way, and\nthe key here is actually to remember this.\n\n447\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.300\nAll the IP version six addresses,\n\n448\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.860\nwill look pretty much end up\nlooking like this because they\n\n449\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.180\nall of the software normally compresses\nit all the way down as far as it can go.\n\n450\n00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.490\nSo here is the full proper\nformat if you want to call that.\n\n451\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.810\nMost of them have modified and now Daniel,\nit almost looks just about in half here.\n\n452\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.640\nNot exactly, but two thirds maybe\n&gt;&gt; Getting there.\n\n453\n00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it can do that.\n\n454\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.950\nNow there's actually gonna be special\naddresses that we'll see that are much\n\n455\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.240\nshorter too.\n\n456\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.840\nBecause they actually have maybe the\nprefix which is maybe the first few bits.\n\n457\n00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.900\nAnd then it doesn't actually matter\nuntil the last few bits, and\n\n458\n00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.770\nthen in between are essentially\nall zeros as well.\n\n459\n00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.190\nAnd that gets compressed down\ninto just two colons as well.\n\n460\n00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.930\nSo you an end up seeing something\nlike that as you do this too.\n\n461\n00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.860\nNow, if you're first trying this out,\nokay?\n\n462\n00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:04.570\nMake sure you pay attention that\nidea of where double zeros appear.\n\n463\n00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.970\nGreat points on the exam, right?\n\n464\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:11.330\nCan only appear one time and also of\ncourse when you have that contiguous set.\n\n465\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:16.320\nSo even if you have on set, or if it's\nactually two, or three, or four sets\n\n466\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.210\nthey all end up getting compressed as long\nas they are side by side in doing that.\n\n467\n00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.980\nYou can of course reduce\nthose leading zeros as well,\n\n468\n00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:28.170\nyou cannot remove the zeros in between,\nnumbers.\n\n469\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.310\nBecause those are significant\nbits in between.\n\n470\n00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:35.490\nBut leading zeros, you definitely can\nput that, something like that down here.\n\n471\n00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.410\nAnd when you start doing stuff like that,\nthat's where it compresses and\n\n472\n00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.420\nit shows you something like this instead.\n\n473\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:48.360\nSo let me put that ff back here, and\nthen that way, that's what you have.\n\n474\n00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.460\nSo it can be reduced in its size, in the\nformatting of what it actually does, okay?\n\n475\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.690\nNow, this particular address is also\nactually a special type of address,\n\n476\n00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.670\nas well.\n\n477\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.420\nAnd that's what we need to jump into,\nDaniel, is now, we need to, of course,\n\n478\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.790\ntalk about some of the different types of\naddresses that we are likely to encounter.\n\n479\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.090\nYou're likely to see as you start\ndoing IP version 6 networking, okay.\n\n480\n00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.820\nBut Daniel, there's only like three,\nfour minutes left on our [CROSSTALK] so\n\n481\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.545\nit's not enough time for us to get into it\ncuz if I start I'm not gonna be able to\n\n482\n00:25:22.545 --> 00:25:24.690\nfinish.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah that's right.\n\n483\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.260\nIt's how he is,\n\n484\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.540\nhe's like an old some sort of housing he\njust keeps going until he gets there.\n\n485\n00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.820\nOr through yeah, or\nthrough yeah that's right.\n\n486\n00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.950\nSo Ronnie, we will do that,\nwe will and we'll wind you down,\n\n487\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.080\nlet you take some pixie dust here and\nsettle down.\n\n488\n00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.790\nI know he's chomping at the bit\nto get at those addresses.\n\n489\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.370\nBut we're not gonna let\nhim do it just yet.\n\n490\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.220\nSo come back for part two on this.\n\n491\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.510\nRonnie, we'll see you there, we do thank\nyou good folks out there for watching.\n\n492\n00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.850\nWe're gonna call this one a show signing\noff for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n493\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.260\nDaniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.527\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:12.577\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:15.970\ngreetings, everyone, and welcome back\nto another great episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.790\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.670\nin today's episode we're back with more\nof our CCENT series, and joining us for\n\n8\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.220\na part two in IPv6 addressing,\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.750\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.820\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue taking a look at this\n\n11\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.410\nlittle series here on IP Version 6.\n\n12\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.762\nIt is a transitional at least for us,\n\n13\n00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:39.990\nright, moving from IP version four to IP\nversion six, it's gonna be a little bit of\n\n14\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.611\ntransition that we have to get used to,\nthat we have to understand.\n\n15\n00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:47.698\nIt begins of course with a basic\nunderstanding of what the formatting of IP\n\n16\n00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:48.960\nversion six looks like.\n\n17\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.900\nAnd then also, some of the different\naddresses that we're going to encounter\n\n18\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.830\nas we start to see this.\n\n19\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.110\nSo let's go ahead and start here,\nand we'll start taking\n\n20\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.180\na look at some of the different types of\naddresses and see how far we get, right?\n\n21\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.610\nSo here on my screen I've tried to divide\nthis up to help us out a little bit more.\n\n22\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.600\nAnd we're just gonna spend some time\nin identifying some of the formats and\n\n23\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.350\nmaking sure that we can see\nwhat we need to, right?\n\n24\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.050\nJust remember the key here, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.890\nSo at the very beginning of everything,\n\n26\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.390\nwhen they first started coming\nout with it, they did this.\n\n27\n00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.230\nThey took the 128 bits,\n\n28\n00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.540\nthey said the first part is really\ngoing to be your network ID.\n\n29\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.220\nAnd technically, they call it the unicast\nprefix because we are now talking about\n\n30\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.180\nunicast types of addressing.\n\n31\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.845\nJust like what we had talked about in\nIP version 4 where there is unicast,\n\n32\n00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:41.822\nthere's broadcast, and there is multicast,\nwell, IP version 6 there are unicast.\n\n33\n00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:45.190\nBroadcasts they have completely gone away,\nokay?\n\n34\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.330\nAnd now, we have multicast and\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n35\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.920\nEssentially, multicast replaces or\nsupersedes what broadcasts do, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.730\nSo that's what you'll end up\nseeing is what happens there.\n\n37\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.640\nSo broadcast addresses are pretty much\njust disappeared by IP version 6.\n\n38\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.930\nOver on the left-hand side, there's\ngonna be some different types of unicast\n\n39\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.680\naddresses that you need to be\nvery familiar with as you go and\n\n40\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.260\nstart to see this on the exam as well.\n\n41\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.629\nAnd also, of course,\n\n42\n00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.820\nsome of them will be utilities just\nlike what we have an IP version 4.\n\n43\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.410\nSome them will, of course,\nrepresent different things, and\n\n44\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.250\nthen I will show you some of the other,\n\n45\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.870\nlike this last one here in IP version 4\nformat, we'll talk about that one, too.\n\n46\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.340\nSo at the very beginning here,\nI just wanted to try and\n\n47\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.620\nset up the stage of what you actually\nend up seeing a lot of times too, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.830\nThe first type of unicast address\nthat we're gonna talk about, and\n\n49\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.080\nwe've actually left off the big one\nwhich I have on another slide here,\n\n50\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.280\nwe're gonna talk about the global\nunicast address as well, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.960\nBut at the beginning,\n\n52\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.420\nsome of the ones that you might end up\nseeing as kind of a little bit strange.\n\n53\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.090\nIf you have where it's actually\nall zeros that are reported, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.200\nSo if you see eight sections and they're\nall zeros, okay, and then this ends with\n\n55\n00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.850\na /128 here, they're essentially\ntelling you this is the network ID.\n\n56\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.380\nAll 128 of them, it's all zeros,\nit is called an unspecified address.\n\n57\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.840\nNow the unspecified address, it can be\nthe source of an IP version 6 traffic.\n\n58\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.380\nBut what it normally actually means for\n\n59\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.058\nus is that the traffic source has yet\nto be identified.\n\n60\n00:03:31.058 --> 00:03:32.020\nIn other words,\n\n61\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.704\nthey don't really have an address assigned\nto whatever interface it came from.\n\n62\n00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:40.342\nSo instead of actually just\nleaving it blank at that point,\n\n63\n00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:46.340\nthey're gonna put one that begins with\nall zero's instead, and the whole thing.\n\n64\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.901\nSo when you see it, you actually see that\ncontiguous string of all those zeros,\n\n65\n00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:56.230\nokay, and\nthen at the end you'll see a slash 128.\n\n66\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.864\nNow, if you shorten it up, okay, what it\nactually ends up looking like is this\n\n67\n00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:03.762\nportion right here that is highlighted,\nokay?\n\n68\n00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:09.251\nWhich is a ::0 /128.\n\n69\n00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.192\nNow, that address, if you go and\nyou think about the idea of routing, so\n\n70\n00:04:13.192 --> 00:04:17.263\nthose of you that are familiar with\nthe routing table inside, let's say,\n\n71\n00:04:17.263 --> 00:04:19.350\nof a Windows machine, right?\n\n72\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.700\nIf you take a look at something like that,\nlet's see if I can point that out here.\n\n73\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.950\nLet me go to my command prompt,\nand then we'll do the route print,\n\n74\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.050\nokay, you'll notice that I have one\nof those addresses right here, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.070\nAnd when you see where it's actually all\nzeroes, okay, this is now saying in this\n\n76\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.510\nIP version 6 route table is that, look,\nhere's where it's actually going.\n\n77\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.762\nNow, what does that actually mean?\n\n78\n00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:49.490\nIt means it can go anywhere.\n\n79\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.290\nNotice it's unspecified.\n\n80\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.710\nIt's saying, look,\nI don't have a particular destination.\n\n81\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.768\nBut normally, what we're actually doing\nis when we do something like that,\n\n82\n00:04:57.768 --> 00:04:59.568\nwe're telling it to\nsend it somewhere else.\n\n83\n00:04:59.568 --> 00:05:03.275\nAnd this one says send it out on that\nsame link, which is perfectly fine.\n\n84\n00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:07.160\nBut in Cisco land, okay,\nyou'll probably see this as possibly being\n\n85\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.890\na source address, rarely\na destination address a lot of times.\n\n86\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.810\nBut in the world of Microsoft,\n\n87\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.270\nyou actually do see where it's actually\nthat destination address as well, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.709\nSo that one is actually gonna\nbe something that we can use.\n\n89\n00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:22.035\nAnd in our routing table,\n\n90\n00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:26.132\nif we actually just see it because we've\ndone some type of show command in Cisco,\n\n91\n00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:30.292\nit's probably because we do not know what\nthe actual source is, so they're still\n\n92\n00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:34.300\nsaying traffic from source that we don't\nknow, it can still come out, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.270\nSo that's where you have it.\n\n94\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.656\nSo make sure you can\nactually identify that.\n\n95\n00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:43.080\nNow, the other one that we\nalso have is the same thing as\n\n96\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.060\nwhat we have inside of IP version 4,\nwhich is the loop-back address.\n\n97\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.983\nSo most of us have learned\nthe idea of the home address or\n\n98\n00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.837\nthe loop-back address, right?\n\n99\n00:05:52.837 --> 00:05:58.400\n127.0.0.1, usually that's\nwhat it's going to be.\n\n100\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.450\nBut remember that in all reality\nit's that entire network range.\n\n101\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.225\nSo, Daniel,\nhave you actually ever pinged anything for\n\n102\n00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:12.097\nyour loop-back besides 127.0.0.1?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n103\n00:06:12.097 --> 00:06:13.522\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and what did you get?\n\n104\n00:06:13.522 --> 00:06:15.620\nDid you get a reply?\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n105\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you actually ended up getting\n\n106\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.980\na reply here, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.900\nSo here's the one that we normally do.\n\n108\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.990\nAnd the loop-back address\nreally is tied back to what?\n\n109\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.600\nMy own interace, right?\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n110\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.637\n&gt;&gt; So if I go and ping 127.254.139.245,\n\n111\n00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:38.985\nokay, Daniel,\nwho's actually replying here?\n\n112\n00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:42.060\nWho do you think is replying\nto that address at all?\n\n113\n00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming it's also the loop-back.\n\n114\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.070\n&gt;&gt; It is also the loop-back.\n\n115\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.064\nAnd see, that's the weird thing.\n\n116\n00:06:48.064 --> 00:06:51.569\nMost of us, because we've only\nbeen trained like 127.0.0.1,\n\n117\n00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.660\nthat's the only address you ping.\n\n118\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.888\nYou can ping anything in 127 and\nit's actually your own loop-back, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:00.670\nIt's your own machine answering here.\n\n120\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.925\nSo, anything in the 127 range.\n\n121\n00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:07.020\nThat's not exactly mind blowing,\nbut you kinda look and go,\n\n122\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.106\nwait a minute, I'm 0.0.1.\n&gt;&gt; So, funny thing.\n\n123\n00:07:11.106 --> 00:07:18.028\nI actually use that to exploit\na system that was blocking 127.0.0.1,\n\n124\n00:07:18.028 --> 00:07:24.650\nwasn't blocking 127.0.0.2 or 127.200.0.1.\n\n125\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.385\nAnd I was able to get it to respond.\n&gt;&gt; And that does lead you to actually\n\n126\n00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:33.670\nrealize how narrow we've\ngotten in our focus sometimes,\n\n127\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.450\nthat someone might have actually done\nthis, if you did this through a firewall,\n\n128\n00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.300\nsaid I just need to block that loop-back\naddress, that one loop-back address, and\n\n129\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.550\nnot thinking about that entire range,\nwhat are called Bogon ranges, too.\n\n130\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.160\n&gt;&gt; And just saying, look,\n\n131\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.460\nthe whole range here.\n\n132\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.840\nSo you can get tripped up.\n\n133\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.416\nAnd thank you for that example, cuz I\ndidn't even think about that as exploiting\n\n134\n00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:54.558\nthat particular device.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] cross-site scripting, and\n\n135\n00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:57.690\nI wanted to do it against that local host,\nso I was doing 127,\n\n136\n00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.546\nthen they got smart and\nclosed down 127.0.0.1.\n\n137\n00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.820\nThen I used localhost.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n138\n00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just because that-\n\n139\n00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:03.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that works, too.\n\n140\n00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.602\n&gt;&gt; That translates.\n\n141\n00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:06.300\n[LAUGH] They shut that down.\n\n142\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.235\nThen I was like, well,\nwe'll try something else.\n\n143\n00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:11.760\nIPv6 is localhost as well.\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah, so\n\n144\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.495\nwhen we start doing that with IPv6,\nokay, they really only have one though.\n\n145\n00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:17.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n146\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.791\n&gt;&gt; So, for\n\n147\n00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:22.696\nus it's all zeros, and then in\nthe interface ID it's gonna be a one.\n\n148\n00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:27.610\nSo now notice that I still get\nreplies that are coming through,\n\n149\n00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.150\nand this allows us to see that\nit is also working as well.\n\n150\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.610\nReplying to what we see,\nwhich is the protocol, and\n\n151\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.850\neverything is actually working too, okay.\n\n152\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.012\nNow, remember that all of these,\nright, at least these first two here,\n\n153\n00:08:40.012 --> 00:08:42.984\nit's still the same thing,\nit's still the first 128 bits here.\n\n154\n00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:45.634\nThey're actually gonna\nbe designated this way.\n\n155\n00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:48.880\nYou should not see any\nother numbers in front.\n\n156\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.990\nThey should really, in this network\nportion, always be zeroes, and\n\n157\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.560\nthen the same thing here.\n\n158\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.990\nMake sure you know those two.\n\n159\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.270\nAs simple as it is, and you go,\nokay Ronnie, that's easy enough.\n\n160\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.240\nIt's really difficult on an exam when\nthey give you both of them, and you can't\n\n161\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.680\nremember which one's the loop back, and\nwhich one's the unspecified address.\n\n162\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.890\nMake sure you actually\npay attention there,\n\n163\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.210\nto make sure you can distinguish them.\n\n164\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.940\nSo you'll see these right\nthere to help you out.\n\n165\n00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.660\nNow, the other one here, and this is one\nthat also can get confused with another\n\n166\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.540\ntype of address, in the way that's\nactually listed here, okay.\n\n167\n00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.922\nSo, there is what we call\na unique local address,\n\n168\n00:09:28.922 --> 00:09:32.069\nsometimes you also see\nit abbreviated as ULA.\n\n169\n00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:38.128\nLet me type that out just in case somebody\nactually does read that that way.\n\n170\n00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:41.591\nULA, the unique local address.\n\n171\n00:09:41.591 --> 00:09:45.634\nThis type of address here is very\n\n172\n00:09:45.634 --> 00:09:51.090\nsimilar to your APIPA address, okay.\n\n173\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.850\nNow, if you've already been\nreading about this, and\n\n174\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.870\na lot of people get this confused with\nwhat they call the link local address, and\n\n175\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.297\nthey go, yeah, that functions\nexactly like APIPA does, okay.\n\n176\n00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:06.470\nWell, both of them function\nlike what APIPA does, okay, but\n\n177\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:13.220\ninside of the unique local, okay,\nyou have a different range here, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.180\nSo the unique local,\n\n179\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.550\nmake sure you equate that to something\nthat's very similar to the APIPA address.\n\n180\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.540\nIf you take a look at\nthe very first portions in\n\n181\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.484\nthe unicast prefix here,\nokay, the first seven bits.\n\n182\n00:10:27.484 --> 00:10:32.503\nSo if we were to convert this FC,\nand the first seven bits here,\n\n183\n00:10:32.503 --> 00:10:37.645\nand I'll just use this space right here,\nF would be all ones.\n\n184\n00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:43.205\nThat gives us 15, which is the equivalent\nof what we see as F, and then C would be,\n\n185\n00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:50.212\nA is 10, B is 11, C is 12,\nthat would be 1 1 0 0, okay, like that.\n\n186\n00:10:50.212 --> 00:10:53.542\nAnd now they're saying\nit's the first seven bits.\n\n187\n00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:59.532\nSo, according to the prefix notation\nthat we see right here, the prefix link,\n\n188\n00:10:59.532 --> 00:11:05.182\nwhat they're telling us is that\nthat portion of the very beginning\n\n189\n00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:11.370\nof the address, the first seven bits,\nare the ones that will not change, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.620\nNow, technically,\n\n191\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.490\nthere's actually even another one\nthat we can actually convert there.\n\n192\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.590\nDid I do that right?\n\n193\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.790\nYeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.923\n&gt;&gt; I start looking at a series of ones\n\n195\n00:11:19.923 --> 00:11:21.346\nlike, how many ones did I put down there?\n\n196\n00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:24.220\nSo I needed to count again,\nthat's right, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.250\nSo, this one actually\nallows us to do that,\n\n198\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.070\nand then that can also change to a one\nas well, as you need more numbers.\n\n199\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:37.000\nSo this range goes all the way from FC00,\nif you actually need it to at the end,\n\n200\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.450\nall the way through to FC, actually FF.\n\n201\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.540\nToday though, even though that's the\nofficial RFC standard that's out there,\n\n202\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.309\nmost of the time, at least in the realm\nof Cisco, if not every other place,\n\n203\n00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:55.455\nthey use FD00 instead, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:57.804\nI put down the official one, but\n\n205\n00:11:57.804 --> 00:12:03.760\nin the Cisco land you're gonna see FD00,\nand that will also be a /8.\n\n206\n00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.540\nSo if you see anything\nthat begins with FD,\n\n207\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.000\nwhatever that's actually after that,\nmake sure you pay attention here, and\n\n208\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.230\nrelate that to something that is\nvery similar to the APIPA address.\n\n209\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.282\nIt can be used in the same local area\nnetwork that uniquely identifies you,\n\n210\n00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:22.861\nso that you can send unicast traffic.\n\n211\n00:12:22.861 --> 00:12:24.169\nBut overall though, okay,\n\n212\n00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:27.010\nthat's what you'll actually\nprobably see most of the time.\n\n213\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.720\nSo here is that official standard,\nand then for\n\n214\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.280\nus, the rest of this can actually\nbe whatever else it needs to.\n\n215\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.730\nSo you might actually end up seeing,\n\n216\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.740\nwhatever else follows is\nfine at that point, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.680\nNow that last one's a little bit unusual.\n\n218\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.505\nYou probably don't see\nthis too often anymore.\n\n219\n00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:47.400\nIf you see it anyplace,\nit's gonna be inside of Cisco labs, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.125\nIP version 4 mapped addresses.\n\n221\n00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:55.420\nIt's exactly like what I would\nhave expected IP version 6 to do.\n\n222\n00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.500\nWhich is to say, hey, if I have\n192.168.10.1 as an IP address now,\n\n223\n00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.077\nwhy don't I just take 32 bits of that,\nand put it into the 128 bits?\n\n224\n00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:06.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n225\n00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.270\n&gt;&gt; And just, yeah, that makes sense, okay.\n\n226\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.560\nSo they did the same thing.\n\n227\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.210\nAnd as you see, let's take a look at\nthe prefix again right behind my head.\n\n228\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.283\nRight here, 96.\n\n229\n00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:18.799\nSo if I think about this idea,\n32 bits plus 96.\n\n230\n00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.127\nOr 128 minus 96, right?\n\n231\n00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:24.690\nEither way actually works,\nit's 128 bits, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.013\nSo they did essentially the same thing,\nthat somewhere in between,\n\n233\n00:13:30.013 --> 00:13:34.434\nokay, they actually allow you\nto go all the way through.\n\n234\n00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:38.070\nAnd then in the last section of it,\nyou actually end up with all Fs.\n\n235\n00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.389\nBut they take your 32 bits of\nyour IP version 4 address,\n\n236\n00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:45.440\nconvert it to hexadecimal and\nslap that there at the end, okay.\n\n237\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.816\nNow you don't really see\nthat very often anymore.\n\n238\n00:13:47.816 --> 00:13:51.623\nBut if you wanted to learn the hexidecimal\nand IP version 6 at the same time,\n\n239\n00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:54.017\nit's a great way to do\nthis on every interface.\n\n240\n00:13:54.017 --> 00:13:56.198\nJust go, here's what I would\nhave done in IP version 4.\n\n241\n00:13:56.198 --> 00:14:00.293\nAnd then at the end actually put\nyour own address in there, so\n\n242\n00:14:00.293 --> 00:14:02.234\nthat you know what it can be.\n\n243\n00:14:02.234 --> 00:14:06.617\nAnd I've actually seen people, instead\nof actually even doing the conversion to\n\n244\n00:14:06.617 --> 00:14:09.232\nhexadecimal, just type that in there,\nright.\n\n245\n00:14:09.232 --> 00:14:12.761\nSo, instead, you might see something\nat the end of this address,\n\n246\n00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:16.240\nif you were to convert and do that,\nsomething like this instead.\n\n247\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.290\nSo let's take the last two sections.\n\n248\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.546\nYou might actually do a 0192,\nand then 168.\n\n249\n00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:25.305\nLike that.\n\n250\n00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:31.557\nAnd then you could actually\ncontinue to do the same thing,\n\n251\n00:14:31.557 --> 00:14:33.190\nall the way through to the very end.\n\n252\n00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.283\nSo you could do 10 and then dot 1.\n\n253\n00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:40.200\nSo people have also done\nsomething like that.\n\n254\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.060\nSo that actually carries all the way\nthrough to the highest number that you can\n\n255\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.900\nget there.\n\n256\n00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.770\nBut, in other words, as you convert,\nit changes it to hexadecimal.\n\n257\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.140\nSo, that's what would happen, if you\nwere to do something like that as well.\n\n258\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.510\nThis last one is probably\nonly gonna be seen in labs.\n\n259\n00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.030\nYou don't see it anywhere else,\nas far as I know.\n\n260\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.179\nYou won't see it in any other place there,\nokay?\n\n261\n00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:03.915\nThese addresses are really helpful in\neverything that we do in networking to\n\n262\n00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:05.250\nhelp us out, right?\n\n263\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.090\nUnspecified address essentially becomes\na default route, a lot of times.\n\n264\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.180\nAs we saw inside of the Windows\nmachine that I'm on right now.\n\n265\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.640\nThe loopback, of course,\n\n266\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.020\nhelps us to test whether or\nnot our interface is working correctly.\n\n267\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.053\nIf I need to send to another address\nthat's not gonna be routed internally, and\n\n268\n00:15:23.053 --> 00:15:25.458\nI need to do it unicast,\nI can also, of course,\n\n269\n00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.462\nhave this type of address to transfer.\n\n270\n00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:32.000\nAnd then IP version four mapped,\nnormally is gonna be if you are trying to,\n\n271\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.500\nagain, do labs and\nlearn a little bit more, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.420\nNow, all those addresses are different\ntypes of unicast address\n\n273\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.800\nthat you should pay attention to, okay?\n\n274\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.288\nBut the most important type of\nunicast address, at least for you and\n\n275\n00:15:46.288 --> 00:15:51.266\nme at this point, is gonna be what we\ncall a global unicast address, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:51.266 --> 00:15:55.664\nAnd in the global unicast address,\nI went ahead, and\n\n277\n00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:59.190\nI have kind of divided this up for us.\n\n278\n00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.294\nSo that we can take a look at\nhow this address breaks down.\n\n279\n00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:06.608\nLet me see if I can put a dotted line\ninstead to make it look like that I put\n\n280\n00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:10.380\na division there so\nthat we can see what happens here, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.830\nSo we start off with understanding.\n\n282\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.630\nAnd there's our network portion, there of\ncourse is our interface ID portion of it.\n\n283\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.590\nIn a global unicast address,\nit actually breaks down into more pieces.\n\n284\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.290\nAnd this something that we want to at\nleast have a basic understanding of\n\n285\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.130\nthat should help us out as well, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:35.550\nRemember that we're really focusing in\nthe global unicast, the first 64-bits.\n\n287\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:40.000\nSo if you add up on the left side here,\nright, 3 bits, 45bits,\n\n288\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.120\nthat should give us 48bits, plus 16,\nthat should give you 64 bits.\n\n289\n00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.340\nThat is really the portion that\nwe are actually going to look at\n\n290\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.770\nright here, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.340\nNow, when you take a look at this type of\naddress, you're gonna see that at the very\n\n292\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.750\nbeginning of all of the Unicast\naddress that you and\n\n293\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.600\nI are pretty much gonna see, it's gonna\nbegin with the decimal number of 2.\n\n294\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.850\nTechnically, a hexadecimal number\nof 2 is what we are going to see.\n\n295\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.790\nAnd if you convert that into binary,\n\n296\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.329\nit's actually the first three bits here,\nokay, of that address.\n\n297\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:23.180\nSo instead of that 2, that actually\nconverts to, is going to be this.\n\n298\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.470\nWhich is going to be the first\nthree bits there, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.990\nSo that's what it ends up converting to,\nright?\n\n300\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.995\nSo remember, there's four bits.\n\n301\n00:17:31.995 --> 00:17:35.396\nSo the first one, actually,\nI'm lying to you once again,\n\n302\n00:17:35.396 --> 00:17:37.040\nlet me do that one more time.\n\n303\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.840\nThere we go.\n\n304\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.630\nThat's what you're actually taking a look\nat there, is the first three bits.\n\n305\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.920\nSee, I can't even do binary anymore.\n\n306\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.120\nSo you're looking at that in hexadecimal.\n\n307\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.897\nYou would take that and\nyou'd convert it into four bits, and\n\n308\n00:17:50.897 --> 00:17:52.560\nthen you change that to a number 2.\n\n309\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.100\nWhich this would, of course,\nbe the second lowest bit in that range.\n\n310\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.060\nWhich gives us a 2.\n\n311\n00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.892\nAnd that's why we end up with\nthat 2 at the beginning.\n\n312\n00:17:59.892 --> 00:18:02.681\nAnd when we take a look here, in theory,\n\n313\n00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:07.769\nall Global Unicast address when they\nfirst assign them at the IANA level,\n\n314\n00:18:07.769 --> 00:18:12.467\nyou actually end up seeing where\nthey say this is gonna be 2000.\n\n315\n00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.823\nThat's what it would look like.\n\n316\n00:18:13.823 --> 00:18:16.772\nIs 2000.\n\n317\n00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:22.204\nAnd then ::/3, and\nthat is how you know that you're actually\n\n318\n00:18:22.204 --> 00:18:27.510\ngetting that from the actual\nassigning authority, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.520\nSo just those first three bits.\n\n320\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.690\nNow, if you take a look and\n\n321\n00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.770\nyou go isn't that limiting if we only\nstay with the least significant bit?\n\n322\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.190\nBut remember, since I actually only take\na look at the first three bits at IANA,\n\n323\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.150\nthey can do what?\n\n324\n00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:42.870\nThey can take those first three bits and\ngo through what?\n\n325\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.770\nEvery possible combination.\n\n326\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.009\nSo if they run out of\nrange that begins with 2,\n\n327\n00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:50.686\ngoing all the way through FFF here,\nwell, then,\n\n328\n00:18:50.686 --> 00:18:56.851\nthey actually just turn on the next\navailable bit which would be 4, right?\n\n329\n00:18:56.851 --> 00:19:00.262\nAnd then,\nthey go all the way through 4FFF.\n\n330\n00:19:00.262 --> 00:19:03.810\nAnd then, if they get all the way through\nthat, then they actually start turning on,\n\n331\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.490\nthen it goes to 5.\n\n332\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.880\nAnd it continues to rise in this number\nbecause of the way that this ends up\n\n333\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.445\nworking, right,\nas you start to do everything.\n\n334\n00:19:12.445 --> 00:19:14.170\nEssentially, all the way up to 8.\n\n335\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:20.160\nAnd then, if you go 8 and the,\nor, and the you got 2, right?\n\n336\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.610\nThat's 14.\n\n337\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.450\nSo in theory, that first number,\nin theory, right?\n\n338\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.840\nAnd 14, it could go all the way up to E.\n\n339\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.010\nSo 2 through E is what that could be,\n\n340\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.470\nand that doesn't really influence\neverybody else on the planet.\n\n341\n00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.800\nSo they can continue to change that\nnumber if we run out of the 2s and\n\n342\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.440\ncontinue to do this, and\nthis doesn't influence anybody else.\n\n343\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.070\nSo IANA, essentially, is in control\nof those first three bits, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.371\nFrom that point, between them, and\n\n345\n00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:52.797\nthen going to this global\nrouting prefix here, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:52.797 --> 00:19:58.229\nThis is where IANA hands off to\nthe regional Internet registries,\n\n347\n00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:59.980\nor IRI, okay?\n\n348\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.550\nThese are, of course,\nall around the globe, and\n\n349\n00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.350\nthey are assigned their portions\nof the address that they have.\n\n350\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.690\nAnd that actually can span all 45 bits,\nbut it doesn't have to, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:17.800\nSo what may happen there at that\nglobal prefix routing is at\n\n352\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.890\nthe Regional Internet Registries,\nthey may conserve a few bits themselves,\n\n353\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.800\nand they can assign now every\nsingle local Internet registry,\n\n354\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.730\nand really sub-regional.\n\n355\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.760\nI don't know how else you'd describe it.\n\n356\n00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.780\nTheir own set of pool of numbers as well,\nokay?\n\n357\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.020\nSo those 45 bits can do that.\n\n358\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.750\nFrom your local ISP,\nthey essentially can produce\n\n359\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.430\nthis many different sub-nets,\n2 to the 16th power.\n\n360\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.740\nDaniel, imagine this for a single ISP.\n\n361\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.870\nThey're no longer just dealing with,\nlet's say, a range of 100,\n\n362\n00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:58.010\nor let's just say 100 IP addresses\nwhere they have the subnet and\n\n363\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:03.240\neverything, they're actually\ngiven 65,535 possibilities that\n\n364\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.020\nin theory they can actually also hand out.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n365\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:07.970\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of customers.\n\n366\n00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.686\n&gt;&gt; That's why IPv6 has been such that,\n\n367\n00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:14.900\nreally the godsend,\nthe answer to the prayer of the networking\n\n368\n00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.230\npeople out there in the world because,\nI don't know if you've gotten this yet,\n\n369\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.060\nwe're not running out of addresses\nanytime soon when it comes to IPv6.\n\n370\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.270\n&gt;&gt; So every single ISP out there, they can\n\n371\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.840\nhand out about 65,000 just straight up-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who knows, but\n\n373\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:36.440\nI'd be pretty happy if I was able to say,\nI have room for 65,000 customers.\n\n374\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.010\nI think I would be pretty happy.\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully in the 30 years we're looking\n\n375\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.380\nat this old video and Ronnie's going,\n65,000, that's so massive,\n\n376\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.528\nnever\n&gt;&gt; That's so tiny.\n\n377\n00:21:43.528 --> 00:21:44.925\n&gt;&gt; And we're going [CROSSTALK] crazy.\n\n378\n00:21:44.925 --> 00:21:45.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's crazy.\n\n379\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.540\nYou shouldn't have ever said that.\n\n380\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.920\nAnd just when I say that,\nwhat is actually starting to happen?\n\n381\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.488\nSome of the ISPs, even though that's what\nthey are supposed to be handing out,\n\n382\n00:21:53.488 --> 00:21:56.061\nis really beginning with this\nthird octet here, right?\n\n383\n00:21:56.061 --> 00:21:58.166\nSo you think about that,\nright, that's 16, 16.\n\n384\n00:21:58.166 --> 00:21:59.960\nThat's 48, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.930\nSo beginning with the /48 here,\nyou should have your own here, right?\n\n386\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.990\nSo they hand out those, each one,\n\n387\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.300\nactually is handed out to\n65,000 different customers.\n\n388\n00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.520\nBut you're also seeing some ISPs\ngo now we're gonna control this\n\n389\n00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.160\na little bit more, so\ninstead of doing 48, they might do 47.\n\n390\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.430\nOr they might do 46 or 45, and\njust start doing that cuz they want\n\n391\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:28.300\nto reserve some because there's a chance\nthat they're gonna over the 65,536\n\n392\n00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.970\ncustomers in their local Internet area.\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what the chance of them still\n\n393\n00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.295\nbeing in business by\nthe time that happens?\n\n394\n00:22:35.295 --> 00:22:36.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, yeah.\n\n395\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.510\nYou never know.\n\n396\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.754\nBut at this point,\nmost of the time, right,\n\n397\n00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:42.970\nthat's what they're\nsupposed to be letting out.\n\n398\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.040\nBut everybody gets to manage\ntheir own particular slice\n\n399\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.233\nof the pie that they're given, okay?\n\n400\n00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.670\nSo then, that is pretty much it.\n\n401\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.830\nSo make sure you can identify\nthis in the breakdown, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.830\nSo I showed you where it\nslices off at the 2 here, and\n\n403\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.620\nthen you have 45 bits in between.\n\n404\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.410\nAnd then the last 16 bits here,\n\n405\n00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.950\nyour ISPs are essentially handing\nthose out, is what you're having.\n\n406\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:12.155\nNow, once they hand you one\nof those numbers, like EF01,\n\n407\n00:23:12.155 --> 00:23:17.764\nif that happens to be your sub-net number,\nthen internally you have 64 bits,\n\n408\n00:23:17.764 --> 00:23:22.546\nwhich is at least double the size of\nthe current size of the Internet,\n\n409\n00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:24.176\nat least double.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:23:24.176 --> 00:23:24.916\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n411\n00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:29.874\nit's like 31 times larger than the\nactually current size of the internet when\n\n412\n00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:32.950\nyou start to think about it.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n413\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.650\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot.\n\n414\n00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.020\nIt's a lot of addresses that\nyou do not have to sub-net.\n\n415\n00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:43.270\nUnless you're really needing\nto control that space, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.820\nNow, Daniel, we've done this before in so\nmany other shows where we talked about\n\n417\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.620\nstatic addressing, that you and\nI just, when we go, are you joking?\n\n418\n00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.570\nServers, I'm fine.\n\n419\n00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.711\nBut on workstations, I would cry if I had\nto do that even for, I'm going to say 10\n\n420\n00:23:56.711 --> 00:23:59.072\nmachines at this point.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:23:59.072 --> 00:24:01.997\n&gt;&gt; I used to do 100 machines, Daniel, and\n\n422\n00:24:01.997 --> 00:24:03.390\nyou go no, no, no.\n\n423\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.760\nThat's why we would use\nsomething like DHP, right?\n\n424\n00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.740\nSo that can be done, but now we don't\nhave to do this statically, Daniel.\n\n425\n00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.229\n64 bits?\n\n426\n00:24:11.229 --> 00:24:13.830\nThat's a lot of numbers to have to\ntype in just on two or three machines.\n\n427\n00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to number that truck master\n\n428\n00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.792\nschool you were working at?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, truck master,\n\n429\n00:24:16.792 --> 00:24:18.757\ndo you still have that number?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we need that.\n\n430\n00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.550\n&gt;&gt; So here we go.\n\n431\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.420\nNow on the 64 bit, how do people\nend up dealing with this portion.\n\n432\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.090\nWell it's easy, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.760\nFor those that remember back\nwhen we reviewed a little bit of\n\n434\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.652\nsome hardware that we've been talking\nabout such as the network interface card,\n\n435\n00:24:32.652 --> 00:24:35.020\nthe NIC that we have available.\n\n436\n00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.870\nThere's a hardware address on, okay?\n\n437\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.845\nSo you heard the term hardware address,\nburned in address, MAC address,\n\n438\n00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:41.549\nyou name it.\n\n439\n00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:45.331\nWe've heard all of these\ndifferent type of addresses and\n\n440\n00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:48.020\nthat number is a 48 bit number, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:54.981\nSo when you do something like that, that's\nwhat happens is that out of those 64 bits,\n\n442\n00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:59.970\na lot of companies just allow for\nthe network interface cards to\n\n443\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:05.790\nassign 48 bits of this to that\nportion of the interface ID, okay?\n\n444\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.810\nSo that's what will also end up happening.\n\n445\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.635\nNow if your company has also\nended up doing this, right?\n\n446\n00:25:12.635 --> 00:25:16.260\nLet's say that they bought all the NICs\nfor all the machines that they have in\n\n447\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.215\ntheir company, all from Intel,\njust as an example.\n\n448\n00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:22.510\nWell, what that does\n\n449\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:27.390\nis it actually leaves everything as\nbeing almost identical except for\n\n450\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.520\nthe last 24 bits of this interface\nidentifier and that is because on each and\n\n451\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.790\nevery one of those NICs is stamped,\nessentially, a serial number from\n\n452\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:41.990\nthe company or the vendor ID,\nalso known as a unique ID that we have.\n\n453\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:47.270\nSo it really is kind of\na gigantic mass way that\n\n454\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:53.030\nwe can easily have IP addresses\non these machines as well.\n\n455\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.510\nSo this is probably the most important one\nbecause when we talk about the idea of\n\n456\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:02.210\nglobal unicast here, it means that\nthis particular address is routable.\n\n457\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:07.310\nSo with this address, remember that the\nbenefit behind us is we don't need private\n\n458\n00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.250\nIP addresses anymore because private IP\naddresses aren't allowed on the Internet.\n\n459\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.530\nIt means that my own machine can\nactually have an address like this.\n\n460\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.910\nAnd be routed out on the Internet and\ndon't have to worry, again,\n\n461\n00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.060\nabout setting up so\nmany structures in between, okay?\n\n462\n00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.774\nSo in that unicast idea that\nwe've actually talked about here,\n\n463\n00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:29.714\nthere are a lot of different ones\nthat we have to think about, okay?\n\n464\n00:26:29.714 --> 00:26:35.494\nSo do remember, pay attention to what\na specified address is loop back address,\n\n465\n00:26:35.494 --> 00:26:37.286\nthe unique local or ULA.\n\n466\n00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:41.275\nMake sure you pay attention to\nthat abbreviation sometimes.\n\n467\n00:26:41.275 --> 00:26:44.499\nDon't worry about the IP version format,\nI just put that in there for\n\n468\n00:26:44.499 --> 00:26:47.260\nthe sake of completeness cuz\nyou'll see that sometimes.\n\n469\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.280\nAnd then the Global Unicast, this is by\nfar the most important one that we'll\n\n470\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.540\nkind of see at least for the purpose\nof the exam, know the breakdown here.\n\n471\n00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.390\nYeah, I can't tell you anything\ndifferent at this point.\n\n472\n00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.580\nYou don't have to know everything but\nyou have to know at least the breakdown.\n\n473\n00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.260\nRemember that this is the type of\naddress that we normally do end up\n\n474\n00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.135\nassigning to an interface on a router.\n\n475\n00:27:08.135 --> 00:27:12.970\nAnd a lot of times, and of course even on\nindividual host machines that will have.\n\n476\n00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.780\nWe still need to talk about\nassignment of these addresses too but\n\n477\n00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.460\nthere's a few more different types\nof addresses we need to get to.\n\n478\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.230\nBut Daniel, it looks like again that if I\nstart I'm not gonna be able to stop, so\n\n479\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.030\nthere's still a few more for us to cover\nand then we'll get into the configuration\n\n480\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.350\nof these things as well.\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, well not a problem.\n\n481\n00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.360\nI'll look forward to the,\ngetting a trilogy going on.\n\n482\n00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.740\nGood things comes in threes, right?\n\n483\n00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.520\nStar Wars, Lord of the Rings,\nyou name it, all comes in threes.\n\n484\n00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.870\nRonnie's IPv6, it's gonna go right\nthere on the heap with those guys.\n\n485\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.550\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today and\nwe'll see you in part three and\n\n486\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.120\nhopefully we'll see you there as well.\n\n487\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.750\nAs for this episode,\nthen we're gonna call it quits.\n\n488\n00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.230\nFor IT ProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n489\n00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.030\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n490\n00:27:52.030 -->

conclusion,\nit depends on how much I talk, of course.\n\n12\n00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:39.706\nAnd that's where the problems lie.\n\n13\n00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.388\nI'm not gonna say it's not,\ncuz I do talk a lot.\n\n14\n00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:46.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But I will try my best here to make\n\n15\n00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:49.670\nthis not a a four parter button.\n\n16\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.270\nI can't guarantee that.\n\n17\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.670\nBut just as we start here,\nI started looking down at my notes as we\n\n18\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.280\nbegan this show for today, Daniel,\nand I started to realize something.\n\n19\n00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.690\nThat in my mind, I was saying it\ncorrectly, but there was something that\n\n20\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.860\nI did say that was not exactly correct,\nand I want to make that correction here.\n\n21\n00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.330\nAnd I'll make sure that it also\nappears in the show notes.\n\n22\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.627\nBut just in case you kind\nof ran over like I did and\n\n23\n00:01:13.627 --> 00:01:18.100\nyou're now at the middle of part three and\nyou're a little bit confused by something.\n\n24\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.550\nWell, I wanna make\nthe correction right now so\n\n25\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.700\nthat you know what I'm talking about.\n\n26\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.430\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen as we begin.\n\n27\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.750\nThis will help us out.\n\n28\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.005\nIn previous episodes when we\ncovered the Unicast address,\n\n29\n00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.530\nI said that a unique local is\nsimilar to an APIPA address.\n\n30\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.690\nAnd in my mind,\nthat was absolutely 100% right.\n\n31\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.700\nBut I was like, no,\none of them is a private IP address and\n\n32\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.260\nthe other one is APIPA,\n\n33\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.870\nand since we're talking about the other\none, which is a linked local address.\n\n34\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.910\nAnd then I started looking over and\nI was like, I said that backwards.\n\n35\n00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.370\nSo let me correct it now.\n\n36\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.795\nThe unique local are like the private\nIP addresses that we have today.\n\n37\n00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.600\nOkay, that's pretty much\nthe correction that we need.\n\n38\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.920\nAnd then, we'll talk about the other\none which is a linked local,\n\n39\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.960\nwhich is more like the APIPA\naddress in just a moment.\n\n40\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.670\nBut today, we've got a few more addresses.\n\n41\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.680\nSo we've covered Unicast.\n\n42\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.780\nWe of course have talked about\nthe Global Unicast here.\n\n43\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.980\nAnd now,\nwe are moving into Multicast addresses,\n\n44\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.490\nis what we're actually taking a look at,\nokay?\n\n45\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.490\nWhen we back to different\naddress types in IPv4,\n\n46\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.940\nwe of course discussed what a Unicast\naddress was really about, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.630\nIt allows to make sure that the data can\nget from the source to the destination,\n\n48\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.160\na direct path there, nothing else is\nreally interfering in terms of the data\n\n49\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.440\npathway or the address, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.970\nIn a broadcast,\nit's also of course one to everyone, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.480\nSo Unicast, one to one type of addressing\nand one to one type of transmission.\n\n52\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.510\nAnd then, of course,\nin a broadcast it's a one to all or\n\n53\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.210\nevery device on that subnet that we have.\n\n54\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.190\nAnd then we also mentioned Multicast,\nwhich essentially is a one to some, or\n\n55\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.370\none to many,\na subset of the broadcast instead.\n\n56\n00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.420\nIn IP version four, you have all\nthree of those traffic types and\n\n57\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.980\nyou have all three of those\naddress types as well.\n\n58\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.260\nBut in IP version six you only have of\ncourse Unicast types of addresses, and\n\n59\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.760\nyou have multicast types of addresses.\n\n60\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.970\nAnd now, I want you to make sure that you\nunderstand that there is no broadcast,\n\n61\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.038\nmulticast supersedes broadcast\nin IP version six, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:23.470\nSo if somebody says is there\nbroadcast in IP version six?\n\n63\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.085\nTechnically, no.\n\n64\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:28.145\nBut multicast function in its place,\nis what I'd guess.\n\n65\n00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.815\n&gt;&gt; So you can multicast to everyone,\nwhich is like a broadcast, but\n\n66\n00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.635\nit's not technically a broadcast.\n\n67\n00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:37.115\n&gt;&gt; Right, so yeah, that's where\nit gets a little bit confusing.\n\n68\n00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:38.555\nBut the whole goal of course,\n\n69\n00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:43.015\nright, is to understand and make sure that\nwe understand the type of traffic and\n\n70\n00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:47.110\nthe way that it's transmitted and goes out\nis kinda the key difference here when we\n\n71\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.550\ntalk about broadcast versus the multicast,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.140\nBroadcast, once you\nbroadcast it out right,\n\n73\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.160\neverybody should be able to pick up on\nthat broadcast and be able to have that.\n\n74\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.050\nWhereas the multicast allows you to join\nor not join depending on, of course,\n\n75\n00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.010\nbits that are set in your address, whether\nor not you are a part of that group, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.510\nBut that's pretty much the key idea.\n\n77\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.510\nNow, it's still the same\ntype of address type, right?\n\n78\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.020\nSo it's not actually taking any less bits\nout, it's still a 128-bit address, and\n\n79\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.940\nif you and I were to look at it\nwe'd still see all 128-bits.\n\n80\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.934\nBut I do want you to note something in\nboth of these types of multicast addresses\n\n81\n00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:23.669\nhere, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.037\nThey both begin with FF02, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:28.037 --> 00:04:29.954\nFF02.\n\n84\n00:04:29.954 --> 00:04:33.241\nNow here,\nI forgot to actually put this in here, but\n\n85\n00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:36.170\nI need to because it does\nmatter at this point.\n\n86\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.818\nLet me make sure I'm telling you right,\nhere.\n\n87\n00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:40.140\nYeah, it is a /8.\n\n88\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.240\nSo I always get this one and the link\nlocal a little bit confused here, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.600\nBut I told you that this was one\nof the most important parts, and\n\n90\n00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.910\nof course I left it right off\nthe diagram that I created here, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.698\nBoth of these are /8s,\nwhich means we're really only paying, or\n\n92\n00:04:56.698 --> 00:05:01.350\nthe networking portion, right, is really\nonly paying attention to the beginning\n\n93\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.419\nhere where it actually is FF, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.110\nSo the first 8-bits is what's\npaying attention to it.\n\n95\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.320\nSo with multicast,\nthat's what you end up having, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.310\nNotice the 02 and the 02 here.\n\n97\n00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.203\nThose are clear distinguishing\nmarks of what multicast address in\n\n98\n00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:20.221\nIPv6 will look at, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:21.923\nThe difference, though,\n\n100\n00:05:21.923 --> 00:05:25.924\nwill be in the lowest order bit\nof the 128-bits here, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:29.360\nOne is gonna be a 1,\nit's gonna always end in a 1.\n\n102\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.160\nAnd the other one is gonna end in a 2.\n\n103\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.320\nTraditionally, when you\ndo something like this,\n\n104\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.500\nof course, you can have a whole string of\nzeroes in between if you want to, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.460\nBut notice the difference\nover here in the description.\n\n106\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.370\nIf you need to communicate with\nall the nodes on that particular\n\n107\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.060\nnetwork segment, then you're going to use\nFF02, and it's going to end in the 1.\n\n108\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.680\nIf you're only communicating\nwith all the routers,\n\n109\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.880\nthen you're going to do FF02, and\nthen it's also going to end in this 2.\n\n110\n00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.320\nSo when do we use these?\n\n111\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.710\nThe majority of times with the routers,\nif we're doing this, is for\n\n112\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.848\nthings like routing protocols in IPv6.\n\n113\n00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:14.220\nEverything in IPv6, right, on the routing\nprotocols is gonna be in multicast.\n\n114\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.900\nAnd even IPv4, most of it's actually\ndone in multicast today, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.180\nSo it's still gonna be the same way there.\n\n116\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.760\nSo routing protocols 10 update,\nand doing things like,\n\n117\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.290\nof course, multicast addressing as well.\n\n118\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.730\nSo that's actually a key part of\nthe different types of addresses here\n\n119\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.740\nwhen we start to multicast\nis a big part of what we do\n\n120\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.840\nto help us to get that data\nto where we need to go, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.410\nSo that is pretty much in,\nand there is not a lot.\n\n122\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.820\nNow, just when I said that, right.\n\n123\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.230\nSo far, in just our three episodes.\n\n124\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.870\nLet's take a look at the different\ntypes of the addresses.\n\n125\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.660\nSo there is one, two, three, four.\n\n126\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.530\nAnd of course, then we also took at\nthe global unicast, five, at this point.\n\n127\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.840\nAnd now, start adding in six and seven.\n\n128\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.450\nSeven addresses so far, and\nwe have at least one more to go.\n\n129\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.887\nAnd this is the last one we\ngonna really focus in on.\n\n130\n00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.734\nAre there more different\naddresses types out there?\n\n131\n00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:13.700\nYes, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.832\nBut the great thing is, the majority\nof those, even though they exist,\n\n133\n00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:22.102\nhave been superseded, or they've been\nkind of deprecated at this point,\n\n134\n00:07:22.102 --> 00:07:24.505\ndepending on what's happened, right?\n\n135\n00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:28.133\nSo different address types that\nthey were trying to segment off and\n\n136\n00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:31.852\nmake specific types for\ndifferent traffic and stuff.\n\n137\n00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.660\nI said, look, you're now getting it so\n\n138\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.530\noverly complex nobody is going to\nactually know what's happening here.\n\n139\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.580\nSo instead,\n\n140\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.400\nyou'll see what they used to call site\nlocal addresses have kind of disappeared.\n\n141\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.280\nWhy?\nBecause multicast addresses essentially\n\n142\n00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.120\nserve the same thing.\n\n143\n00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.660\nThe only thing that we were\nreally doing was just saying\n\n144\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.250\nwe want to segment this down even further.\n\n145\n00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.240\nYou're doing a multicast of a multicast.\n\n146\n00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.814\nWhy would you do that?\n\n147\n00:07:55.814 --> 00:07:57.929\nWhy would you-\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem to make a lot of\n\n148\n00:07:57.929 --> 00:07:58.613\nsense, right?\n\n149\n00:07:58.613 --> 00:07:59.472\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n\n150\n00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:02.561\nSo in other words, if it functions\nwell in a small environment, and\n\n151\n00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:06.143\nit functions the same way in the big Why\nwould you actually separate that out and\n\n152\n00:08:06.143 --> 00:08:07.678\ntry and make some subset of that?\n\n153\n00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:11.606\nSo that's why you are actually starting\nto see some of those more specific ones,\n\n154\n00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:15.980\nas you did see some of them also\ndisappear at some point in time, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.510\nNow, this is one of the more important\naddresses to that we have to think of,\n\n156\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.620\nwhich is the link local address, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.740\nSo this is the one I did get confused in\nthe beginning cuz I was not looking at\n\n158\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.180\nmy notes here and\nnot paying attention as I said it.\n\n159\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.185\nThis link local address is very similar\nto the APIPA address, but this time\n\n160\n00:08:35.185 --> 00:08:39.170\nwhereas APIPA, at least in this day and\nage, it really is just an indicator,\n\n161\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.540\nright, that, hey,\nsomething in your network is not working.\n\n162\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.790\nSo it's either your machine is not\ntalking to the DHCP server, or\n\n163\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.820\nyour DHCP server isn't functioning.\n\n164\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:56.740\nAnd your own machine in IP version 6\ngives you a 169.254 address, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.700\nSo that's usually what you see there\nwhen you start talking about this idea\n\n166\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.880\nof APIPA.\n\n167\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.590\nAnd once we see that 169.254,\nit's not routable, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.130\nSo that address is not gonna\nbe forwarded by the router.\n\n169\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.640\nYou actually end up getting this without\nyou actually having to do anything.\n\n170\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.450\nYour machine actually assigns itself\nthis address if it can't communicate.\n\n171\n00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.550\nSo in the realm of Windows,\nthat's what they call it.\n\n172\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.910\nThe self assigned address is what\nit's also called as well, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.350\nSo notice here as I wrote down\nsome of the characteristics for\n\n174\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.401\nus, in a link local\naddress in IP version 6,\n\n175\n00:09:33.401 --> 00:09:39.180\ninstead of doing 169.254,\nit begins with FE8, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.976\nI've put the zero there to fill out\nthe actual last bit of that section, but\n\n177\n00:09:43.976 --> 00:09:47.900\nit's a /10, and\nanything can follow after that, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.880\nNow here, when you break that down,\nhere's what it looks like in the binary.\n\n179\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.570\nThe first four in this section here under\nF actually turned out to be all ones.\n\n180\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.440\nAnd then E turns out to\nbe this right here, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.874\nSo remember that F is 15, and\nthen that means that E is 14.\n\n182\n00:10:05.874 --> 00:10:09.150\nSo that's 8, 4, and 2, that's 14.\n\n183\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.570\nAnd then 8 here, and that goes all the way\nto those 10 bits is what it does, right?\n\n184\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.530\nSo for us, it actually is the first bit\nand then the second one is a zero, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.830\nThat's why it actually\ngoes out to ten bits,\n\n186\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.750\nbecause the zero is significant here for\nwhat we want it to be.\n\n187\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.030\nThe rest of this address really\ndoes not matter what it is.\n\n188\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.180\nIf we are actually using FE80 here,\n\n189\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.460\nmore than likely you're\nusing a link local address.\n\n190\n00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.290\nNow, remember I said this is usable.\n\n191\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.303\nAnd the reason why we actually want\nto notice is that this is kinda of\n\n192\n00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:47.677\nthe majority of where all the\ncommunications happen between routers and\n\n193\n00:10:47.677 --> 00:10:50.390\nbetween machines on my network.\n\n194\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.498\nThey don't always have to use\na unicast local address, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:55.498 --> 00:11:00.850\nNot everything actually has to be\nable to use a global routing prefix.\n\n196\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.670\nBut things that are happening just between\nthe devices, if they are talking, if they\n\n197\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.910\nare communicating, this is the address\nthat they're using, which is a link local.\n\n198\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.520\nIf I bring up my machine again, here, and\n\n199\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.710\nlet me run the ipconfig/all, and let's\ntake a look at a couple of things here.\n\n200\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.680\nWe'll go to the ethernet adaptor,\nEthernet0, which is the first one.\n\n201\n00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.780\nYou'll notice that when I take\na look at the IP version 6 address,\n\n202\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.360\nthe first one that it gives\nme begins with fe80, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.850\nThat is the address\nthat's actually on this.\n\n204\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.340\nAnd that's because I'm not really\nrouting this particular computer itself.\n\n205\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.870\nBut if I do a route print,\n\n206\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.200\nyou'll now notice that there\nare some unicast addresses here too.\n\n207\n00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.584\nSo for example, on this one on\nthe fifth line in this table,\n\n208\n00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:56.111\nnotice that there is an actual unicast\naddress right here with a /128,\n\n209\n00:11:56.111 --> 00:12:01.060\nand then you also have,\nof course, link local addresses.\n\n210\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.446\nAnd you can see there is first\n64 bits here, and then 128.\n\n211\n00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:09.801\nAnd now you actually see like\nthe ones that we were talking about,\n\n212\n00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:12.810\nwhich is just the /8s\nhere on the link as well.\n\n213\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.440\nThose are also there and available to you.\n\n214\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.052\nSo now notice that this machine alone,\nDaniel, just on my virtual machine, right,\n\n215\n00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:26.070\nI have, let' see, one,\ntwo, possible three,\n\n216\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.350\nfour different addresses that it's\nactually on the link that we can actually\n\n217\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.530\nuse here or find in the destination\nof what needs to happen.\n\n218\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.350\nSo it's kind of amazing that\nwe'll actually see multiple IP\n\n219\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.610\nversion 6 addresses for\nthe different types of traffic and\n\n220\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.780\ndifferent things that will be used here,\nokay?\n\n221\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.572\nSo I'll also put down on this one,\njust as a reminder throughout the show,\n\n222\n00:12:47.572 --> 00:12:52.821\nif I forgot to say it again, remember that\nULA is more like the private IP address,\n\n223\n00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:56.650\nwhereas the link local is more\nlike the APIPA address here.\n\n224\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.294\nThat's what I wanted to make\nsure that we emphasized.\n\n225\n00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:04.271\nAll right, Daniel,\nthose are kind of the major IP version 6\n\n226\n00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:08.670\naddresses that you and\nI will pretty much encounter.\n\n227\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.972\nAnd nothing else at this point,\nas far as identifying those addresses,\n\n228\n00:13:12.972 --> 00:13:15.580\nyou really can matter above this thing.\n\n229\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.372\nYou've got to know them.\n\n230\n00:13:17.372 --> 00:13:19.300\nYou've gotta memorize them.\n\n231\n00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.280\nThat's the easy way to get\neasy points on the exam.\n\n232\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.730\nI know that memory work,\nit sounds like it's hard but\n\n233\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:30.450\nit's really you taking note cards or\nwriting it down and writing down\n\n234\n00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.570\nas easy points on the Cisco exam that\nreally can get you so close to passing.\n\n235\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.100\nIt's amazing of all the things\nwhen we say memory, it really is.\n\n236\n00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.935\nThat's the easiest ones that we can do.\n\n237\n00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:45.030\nBut these eight different ones,\nyou've gotta be able to spot them and\n\n238\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.060\nknow what they actually identify with,\nand be able to go,\n\n239\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.620\nI know that that's a multicast address or\nthat's a link local address as well, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.830\nNow, we've been dealing with\njust really the prefix, right?\n\n241\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.470\nThe unicast prefix or\nthe network ID all this time.\n\n242\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.380\nWe do need to talk about the other\nportion just briefly, okay?\n\n243\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.425\nThe last 64 bits here I've\nkind of ignored totally.\n\n244\n00:14:07.425 --> 00:14:08.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At this point, except for\n\n245\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.310\nevery once in a while having a one or two.\n\n246\n00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.990\n&gt;&gt; To reference it?\n\n247\n00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nevery once in a while having a one or two.\n\n248\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.119\nAnd then I explained to you that there is\na chance that you can also use your MAC\n\n249\n00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:20.350\naddress in that portion\nof the address as well.\n\n250\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.077\nBut it doesn't work just by itself\nbecause out of those 64 bits, right,\n\n251\n00:14:25.077 --> 00:14:27.790\na MAC address is only 48 of those.\n\n252\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.450\nSo how do you actually\nfill up the rest of that?\n\n253\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:35.544\nWell, the way that you do that is\nthrough what is called EUI-64.\n\n254\n00:14:35.544 --> 00:14:41.710\nSo if you are actually going to allow your\nmachine to identify its own interface ID,\n\n255\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:48.200\nokay, that means that it has to come up\nwith 64 bits to be able to essentially\n\n256\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:54.490\nbe unique inside of whatever network you\nare actually given in your unicast prefix.\n\n257\n00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.450\nSo if we were to break this down,\nokay, here is what I actually did.\n\n258\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.590\nI took the MAC address on my virtual\nmachine, which is this one right here.\n\n259\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.820\nI went ahead and\nconverted it into the binary so that you\n\n260\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.680\ncould actually see what it would actually\nlook like in terms of the MAC address.\n\n261\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.200\nBut here it is, it's 48 bits on\nthe MAC address at this point.\n\n262\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:23.260\nOnce you do that, what IP version 6 and\nthe protocol, what it does and says and\n\n263\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.523\ngives us the ability to do, is that now\nI'm gonna take that entire 64 bits,\n\n264\n00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:33.650\nand then we are gonna add\nin 16 bits of this, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.670\nAnd those 16 bits are gonna be FFFE.\n\n266\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.140\nAnd once you do that,\n\n267\n00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.540\nthat turns it into that extended\nunique identifier, is what it does.\n\n268\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.010\nNow, of course it doesn't just add\nit at the end or at the beginning.\n\n269\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:52.377\nIt says, right smack dab in the middle\nof your 48 bit address, we're\n\n270\n00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:58.295\ngonna add 16 bits in it, and I've coded\nthose in red so that you could see it.\n\n271\n00:15:58.295 --> 00:16:01.271\nSo you go ahead and you add that in, and\n\n272\n00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:07.316\nnow notice that your MAC address now\nturns into a 64 Bit Mac address as well,\n\n273\n00:16:07.316 --> 00:16:11.810\nin theory,\nwith the addition of these 16 bits.\n\n274\n00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.180\nNow in the earliest stages of this,\n\n275\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.040\nwhat they were afraid of, is that even\nwith this at somewhere down the line\n\n276\n00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.410\nof 64 bits that they would end\nup with a duplicate number.\n\n277\n00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.560\nSo what they decided, and\nI don't know how they decided this, but\n\n278\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.350\nsomebody decided this.\n\n279\n00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.700\nThe seventh bit of that first section\n\n280\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.480\nof the first bits here,\nthe seventh bit in that first\n\n281\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.740\noctet that we see that would\nactually become significant.\n\n282\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.620\nSo I marked this one in green, so\nthat's actually significant for us.\n\n283\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.399\nTo ensure the uniqueness of the EUID,\n\n284\n00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:57.315\nif it happened to be a 0,\nthey would go ahead and turn it on.\n\n285\n00:16:57.315 --> 00:17:03.208\nWell, if you did that, notice that\nit changes your 48 bit MAC address,\n\n286\n00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:06.250\neven though it changes it to 64 bit,\n\n287\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:12.170\nit also flips that second number to\na 2 because notice that would be what?\n\n288\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.530\nIn binary that would be a 1 and\nthat would be a 2 to flip it to a 2.\n\n289\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.590\nNow Daniel, what happens out?\n\n290\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.400\nWhat if that number is something else,\nokay?\n\n291\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.500\nSo what if we actually have like a 1,\n1 there, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or a 1,1,1,1, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:29.770\nWhat if we have something like that?\n\n294\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.680\nWell, later on they said yeah,\nwe can't just flip that.\n\n295\n00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.870\nSo what they said is if it's\nactually any other number,\n\n296\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.320\nin other words if it's a 1,\nthey're actually gonna turn it off.\n\n297\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.000\nSo they flip that either way, so\nnow notice that if it actually did have,\n\n298\n00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.930\nlet's just pretend that\nthis was a 2 anyways.\n\n299\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.000\nAnd then, it actually came across and that\nwas a 1 well they just turned it off and\n\n300\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.780\nthey made it a 0.\n\n301\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.718\nSo that's why you will get some weird,\nwhere people look at and\n\n302\n00:17:58.718 --> 00:18:00.771\ngo, it's just a MAC address with FF-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n303\n00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:02.590\n&gt;&gt; Not exactly, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.570\nThey added that in there and\n\n305\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:09.210\nthat is what is used currently today\nwhich is called the Modified EUI-64.\n\n306\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.837\nAnd this is version that they specifically\ncall out which is the one that can\n\n307\n00:18:13.837 --> 00:18:14.429\ndo both.\n\n308\n00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:19.119\nIf it's a 0, it won't go in and flip it,\nif it's a 1 it will go ahead, and\n\n309\n00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.246\nflip it that way.\n\n310\n00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:24.630\nThe original one, just look just take\nthe seventh bit and make sure it's on.\n\n311\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.028\nSo that's the way that it happens.\n\n312\n00:18:26.028 --> 00:18:27.604\n&gt;&gt; It's like a very truncated,\n\n313\n00:18:27.604 --> 00:18:30.639\ntrucked down version of like\nrandom number generating.\n\n314\n00:18:30.639 --> 00:18:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.710\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and so\nthis is key for us understanding this.\n\n316\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.850\nI don't wanna type in\n64 bits on a static IP.\n\n317\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.920\nWhat I would rather do,\n\n318\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.060\nat the end when I do the addressing you'll\nsee when we get into configuration.\n\n319\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.595\nIf I don't wanna do that, I type out\nthe first portion of what I want.\n\n320\n00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:52.940\nSo whether I want a multicast address,\nor a unicast address like 200.\n\n321\n00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.620\nI can do a double colon at the end\nof that, I can do a slash and\n\n322\n00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.860\nthen put EUI-64, and\nthis is what it will do.\n\n323\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.190\nIt will take the MAC address and\n\n324\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:09.640\nconvert it into binary,\nadd 16 bits here in the middle.\n\n325\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.200\nGo to the seventh bit and either flip it\non or off depending on what it finds.\n\n326\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.120\nAnd then,\nthis is what you'll get in the end result.\n\n327\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.900\nAnd when you do that,\nthat's what will make that\n\n328\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.310\nunique identifier,100% unique is the way\nthat they actually describe it here.\n\n329\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.420\nSo it is more of an extensive process,\n\n330\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.390\nthan just what people say, just add\nthe Mac address and there just fine.\n\n331\n00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.970\nYou could see there are essentially\nrelatively complex, but\n\n332\n00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.320\nthe great thing Daniel, you and I will\nnever have to figure this out, okay?\n\n333\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.270\nNow, you've got, so Ronnie,\nwhat do you explain?\n\n334\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.170\nBecause people always acts like,\nall right, so what does it do it that way.\n\n335\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.856\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's the way they chose,\n\n336\n00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:49.557\nthey wanted to fill that out to make sure\nthat the only thing that was in these 64\n\n337\n00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:50.728\nbits is the Mac address.\n\n338\n00:19:50.728 --> 00:19:54.027\nThat was something that they knew that\nthey could identify easily, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:57.313\nSo you can always spot\nthat by looking here and\n\n340\n00:19:57.313 --> 00:20:03.369\nrealizing that it's it's an EUI-64, and\nwhen you see in those last 64 bits,\n\n341\n00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:07.560\nFF-FE, right in the middle\nof those 64 bits.\n\n342\n00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.380\nEvery single time, that'll help\nyou identify that no matter what.\n\n343\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.958\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's like a big\nblinking neon sign going, hello,\n\n344\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.117\nyou should know what I am right now.\n\n345\n00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:21.745\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully, me emphasizing it three\nor four times within the last two minutes,\n\n346\n00:20:21.745 --> 00:20:23.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One more time, Ronnie, for\n\n347\n00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:23.639\ngood measure.\n\n348\n00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.592\n&gt;&gt; Remember, you're looking for FF-FE\nessentially is what you're looking for\n\n349\n00:20:27.592 --> 00:20:31.120\nthat will tell you, hey,\nthis is how it actually came about.\n\n350\n00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.380\nSo don't always think that\nit's just randomly generated.\n\n351\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:33.907\nIs that a possible entry?\nYes.\n\n352\n00:20:33.907 --> 00:20:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n353\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.956\n&gt;&gt; Okay, could it be that you just\nsat there and go, I'm just gonna keep\n\n354\n00:20:37.956 --> 00:20:41.940\ntyping in numbers until it tells me\nto stop, done, it's not that way.\n\n355\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.050\nYour Mac address plus those 16\nbits is the key here, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.450\nThey're probably not gonna get\nas picky as this here Daniel,\n\n357\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.830\nwhere they talk about the seventh bit,\nnever know.\n\n358\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.281\nI wouldn't know-\n&gt;&gt; You're free to miss one on some\n\n359\n00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:53.900\nlittle, yeah.\n\n360\n00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.490\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH] So\njust kind of realize,\n\n361\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.690\nthis is the one that is specifically\ncalled out on the objectives for the exam.\n\n362\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.590\nIt sounds weird in my ear when I say that,\nI'm like,\n\n363\n00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.620\nam I actually saying that correctly,\nbut it's called that Modified EUI-64.\n\n364\n00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.901\nNow just realize when\nyou start seeing that,\n\n365\n00:21:11.901 --> 00:21:13.830\nthat is pretty much a not a key, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.944\nAll right, so Daniel,\n\n367\n00:21:15.944 --> 00:21:21.270\nwe got one last thing here to\nactually take a look at, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:26.790\nWe now need to start turning our minds\ntowards the idea of configuration.\n\n369\n00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.550\nAnd one of the key things that they talk,\nand that we're going to talk.\n\n370\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.800\nWe only have a few minutes left.\n\n371\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.690\nSo this is a teaser more\nthan anything else, right?\n\n372\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:39.251\nSo when we get in, we're gonna actually\nkind of stop this series, and we're going\n\n373\n00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:43.630\nto go into configuring IP addresses in\nthe next little mini-series that we do.\n\n374\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.897\nAnd show you how to actually put all\nthese addresses on interfaces, and\n\n375\n00:21:46.897 --> 00:21:49.200\non the machines, and what we want to do.\n\n376\n00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.794\nBut you also have to realize that there's\ndifferent ways to configure this, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:53.794 --> 00:21:57.878\nOne of course, is fairly simple,\nyou can actually say,\n\n378\n00:21:57.878 --> 00:22:03.000\nlook here's what we're gonna do,\nand it can do a Auto Configuration.\n\n379\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.400\nNow in Auto Configuration,\n\n380\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.150\nwhat normally happens is that on your\nrouter you assign an IPv6 address to it.\n\n381\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.230\nOnce you do that and\nyou make that configuration happen,\n\n382\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.670\nit will begin to do what's called\nRouter Advertisement, okay?\n\n383\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.470\nRouter Advertisement essentially say,\nI'm the router go figure.\n\n384\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.200\nIt makes sense right?\n\n385\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.990\nI'm the actual router.\n\n386\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.280\nNow at the same time that's happening,\n\n387\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.010\nyour machine that's prepared with IPv6 and\nready to go with it.\n\n388\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.590\nIt is also sending out router\nsolicitation messages too, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.200\nIt's saying, where's the router?\n\n390\n00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.980\nThis guy's saying, I'm the router.\n\n391\n00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:47.830\nThis guy's asking for where is the router,\nso those two were meant to communicate.\n\n392\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.450\nAnd usually, the main communication\nthat happens at the beginning of course\n\n393\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.350\nis what we call Auto Configuration.\n\n394\n00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.020\nWhich that's alright.\n\n395\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.070\nI'm the router.\n\n396\n00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:01.274\nWhy don't you go ahead and\nassign yourself an IPv6 address, and\n\n397\n00:23:01.274 --> 00:23:06.204\nthe way it will do it,\nis that it will give the network prefix.\n\n398\n00:23:06.204 --> 00:23:10.282\nThe prefix from the router and\nsay, give yourself,\n\n399\n00:23:10.282 --> 00:23:15.530\na unique identifier on this\nparticular prefix number.\n\n400\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.750\nAnd then,\nthe machine itself can configure it\n\n401\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.660\nto do that without anything\nelse that we need.\n\n402\n00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.590\nThat is awesome, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:28.330\nEssentially, the router and\nactually your own machine accesses its own\n\n404\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:33.158\nlittle DHCP server, where you and\nI ever having to bring up a DHCP server.\n\n405\n00:23:33.158 --> 00:23:35.602\nThat's pretty down and cool, okay?\n\n406\n00:23:35.602 --> 00:23:37.560\nDon't ever have to do that.\n\n407\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.380\nAnd when you do something like that\nthat's also known as Stateless Auto\n\n408\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.320\nConfiguration, or SLAAC, S-L-A-A-C.\n\n409\n00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.750\nStateless, I don't know why they\nput the l there, stateless,\n\n410\n00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.258\nS-L-\n&gt;&gt; Because then it's SLAAC instead\n\n411\n00:23:51.258 --> 00:23:51.980\nof SAAC.\n\n412\n00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.213\n&gt;&gt; Auto, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:23:53.213 --> 00:23:56.085\n&gt;&gt; True, yeah, auto address configuration.\n\n414\n00:23:56.085 --> 00:23:59.050\nWhen you do something like that,\nthat's what's happening.\n\n415\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:04.450\nBut the other way you can do this,\nyou can run a DHCPv6.\n\n416\n00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.050\nAnd you can assign those addresses.\n\n417\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.965\nThat is that control of that address\nspace that we were talking about.\n\n418\n00:24:10.965 --> 00:24:12.460\nAre there some companies\nthat will do that?\n\n419\n00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.260\nYou better believe it.\n\n420\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.800\nSome companies go, I want to know that all\nthe addresses are something that we have\n\n421\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.550\nissued not generated itself, not\nanything like that, we want to do some.\n\n422\n00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.700\nSo if you need the control you're\ngonna do what's called stateful,\n\n423\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.270\nwhich means you've brought up your own\nDHCP server, and then you can do that.\n\n424\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.340\nBut if you just put the IPv6\naddress on that interface and\n\n425\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.340\nit is connected in,\nit will begin that communication process.\n\n426\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.260\nIt will have a link local address on it,\n\n427\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.620\nas well as whatever global unicast\naddress you put on this thing.\n\n428\n00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.910\nAnd then it will begin routing\nthat advertisement number, and\n\n429\n00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.020\ngo, here's my link local.\n\n430\n00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.440\nLet's communicate over this.\n\n431\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.100\nAnd here's my global prefix.\n\n432\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.170\nAssign yourself that.\n\n433\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.540\nOkay, let's do this, and it works.\n\n434\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.530\nThat's exactly what starts to happen.\n\n435\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.860\nAnd it gets inside of that\nmulticast group that it needs to.\n\n436\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.340\nIt begins to listen for something\nelse that we called anycast as well.\n\n437\n00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.390\nWhich you can't distinguish from\nthe regular unicast addresses.\n\n438\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.077\nAnycast for us is actually where\nthe router actually says, all right,\n\n439\n00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:17.963\nwhere's the nearest other router that\nI need to be able to communicate to.\n\n440\n00:25:17.963 --> 00:25:21.480\nAnd that's going across networks\nwhen we start doing that.\n\n441\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.820\nSo at this point, we've got a lot\nto actually talk about in terms of\n\n442\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.910\nthe configuration, but Daniel, I think\nthat's enough for what we have at this\n\n443\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:34.000\nparticular point that we need to talk\nabout in terms of the IPv6 addressing.\n\n444\n00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Ronnie, hopefully, all\nthose good folks out there that have been\n\n445\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.940\nwatching or listening all the little\nwords you say with bated breath,\n\n446\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.490\nhanging on every syllable Are now a little\nmore familiar with IPv6 may be if thought,\n\n447\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.210\nit's a bit of a mystery and\nthe mean it's coming crazy.\n\n448\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.154\nYeah, you're right it can be that way,\nbut it doesn't have to be.\n\n449\n00:25:50.154 --> 00:25:53.378\nI think Ronnie, you've done a great\njob of walking us step by step through\n\n450\n00:25:53.378 --> 00:25:54.742\nall the key elements of IPv6.\n\n451\n00:25:54.742 --> 00:25:57.415\nSo we are, a successful on exam, and b,\n\n452\n00:25:57.415 --> 00:26:01.810\nable to actually practically\nimplement that if necessary.\n\n453\n00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.860\nVery cool stuff, Ronnie, we appreciate\nyour time and effort as always.\n\n454\n00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.820\nAnd we appreciate you good folks as well.\n\n455\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.900\nBut's it looks like we're there again.\n\n456\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.370\nAnother great episode wound up for\nITProTV.\n\n457\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.150\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n458\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:13.840\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n459\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.515\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n460\n00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:21.740\n[MUSIC]\n\n461\n00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.284\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.810\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n4\n00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.830\ngreeting everyone and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.580\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we continue on with our\n\n6\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.070\nCCENT Series, joining us in the studio yet\nagain, one Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.780\nRonnie, welcome back,\n\n8\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.640\nhow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Daniel,\n\n9\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.600\nthank you for having me as we\ncontinue on taking a look, of course,\n\n10\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.350\nat learning more about\nour Cisco device as well.\n\n11\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.300\nWe've gone through, if you've been\nwatching this in the series in the order\n\n12\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440\nthat they appear in our library,\nwe've gone through at this point and\n\n13\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.720\ntaken a look at several different things.\n\n14\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.840\nAnd of course we've taken a look\nat the hardware as well and\n\n15\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.770\nnow we are ready to start\npowering the devices on and\n\n16\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.540\nunderstanding the process and\nthe order behind them.\n\n17\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.830\nSo, when you think about this,\n\n18\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.290\nright, everybody has to handle\nthe hardware at some point.\n\n19\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.580\nYou do need to verify as you have to\ntroubleshoot, or you turn them on whether\n\n20\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.990\nor not things are working right so at this\npoint, that's what we need to do, okay.\n\n21\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.600\nSo, we wanna take you through, of course,\nthe initial startup process and what\n\n22\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.940\nyou're actually going to see and of course\nwe're gonna also do this in our practice\n\n23\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.490\nlab so that you can have access to the\nsame equipment that we have as well, okay.\n\n24\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.281\nAnd let's take a look at my screen,\n\n25\n00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:22.760\nwe're gonna use our simple diagram\nonce again to get us a start here.\n\n26\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.650\nAnd we'll be using this diagram,\n\n27\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.400\nthroughout our kind of demonstrations as\nwe get into the Cisco equipment itself and\n\n28\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.080\nthis is something you\nwant to pay attention to.\n\n29\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.190\nWhen it comes down to a router or\n\n30\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.550\na switch starting up, the process is\nrelatively the same as a regular computer.\n\n31\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.400\nYou turn it on, and then you wait for\nsomething to find the operating system,\n\n32\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.780\noperating system gets loaded in RAM, and\nat that point, you are ready to go, okay.\n\n33\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.320\nBut inside of Cisco, though, that whole\nprocess is also part of something that you\n\n34\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.000\nmay have to troubleshoot but\n\n35\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.610\nwe wanna take you through the very\nfirst time that you start up a switch.\n\n36\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.050\nAnd then you'll see that the line that\nactually gets traced through here as we go\n\n37\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.590\nthrough some other configuration and some\nchanges in the startup process at that\n\n38\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.310\npoint that the line will change\ndepending on what you have do, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.400\nSo let's start up at the very top here so\nthat we understand.\n\n40\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.030\nRight when we put the power to the switch\nor we turn the power on the router,\n\n41\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.570\nokay, the routers gonna go through of\ncourse power on self-test verifying that\n\n42\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.280\nall of the hardware is actually\nworking the way that needs to and\n\n43\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.242\nat the same time it's gonna run that,\nokay.\n\n44\n00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:33.040\nWhat we call boot strap at that point,\nokay.\n\n45\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.810\nNow, once the boot strap is running\n\n46\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.438\nit's also gonna end up looking at\nsomething that is actually in what we call\n\n47\n00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:42.960\na register called\nthe configuration register.\n\n48\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.000\nThe configuration register\nis something that you and\n\n49\n00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.850\nI can actually set to tell it whether or\nnot everything is actually\n\n50\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.870\ngoing to start up in the normal\nprocess order that it needs to or\n\n51\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.890\nit's going to need some troubleshooting,\nsomething special, to be loaded in.\n\n52\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.770\nSo, you can actually tell it\nto skip steps if you need to,\n\n53\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.270\nthat's what the configuration\nregister does.\n\n54\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.730\nIf everything is good and it finds the\nproper normal configuration register that\n\n55\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.660\nit needs then it will normally\nget redirected to look for\n\n56\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.640\nan operating system that we\ncall the Cisco IOS, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.060\nNormally on a Cisco router, okay,\nthe IOS and on a Cisco switch,\n\n58\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.070\nit's gonna be found in the area\nof memory that we call Flash.\n\n59\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.170\nNow, Flash works and\n\n60\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.540\nfunctions essentially like the hard drive\non a regular computer, it's gonna go and\n\n61\n00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.770\nit's gonna find a compressed file\nthat is the Cisco IOS on Flash.\n\n62\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.240\nWhen it finds that, and it is actually\ngoing to be the operating system that\n\n63\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.820\nneeds, then from Flash it will\nload the IOS in the RAM and\n\n64\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.950\nwhen it does that it will decompress\nit loading it in the RAM at this point.\n\n65\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.622\nOnce it actually is inside of RAM,\n\n66\n00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:05.424\nthen it will have to locate what\nwe call the startup-config.\n\n67\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.624\nUsually there's another file that\nis stored in what we call NVRAM,\n\n68\n00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:13.630\nnon-volatile ram,\nthat of course allows you to actually have\n\n69\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.670\na file that can persist through\nboot ups and power off and\n\n70\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.680\neverything else and\nthat file is called the startup-.config.\n\n71\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.070\nSo just call it start up config,\n\n72\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.470\nnobody cares about the extension at\nthis point but the startup-config here.\n\n73\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.060\nIf it finds a startup-config\nit will then load that on top\n\n74\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.440\nof the operating system integrating it in\nand you'll have all of your configuration\n\n75\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.050\nthat you have to ensure that\neverything is the way that it needs to.\n\n76\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.310\nNow what if it doesn't?\n\n77\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.970\nWell initially you haven't configured\nanything on the switch, so what it\n\n78\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.650\nwill do instead of doing this part, which\nsays load up, start up, config into RAM,\n\n79\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.410\nit will lead you to what we call the\nset-up screen is what it will do, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.079\nSo, pay attention to this process in\nparticular because you do need to\n\n81\n00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:06.670\nunderstand that it goes from\npost from that point into Flash.\n\n82\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.060\nInside of Flash, it loads the OS\ninto RAM and then you go and\n\n83\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.320\ncheck the NVRAM and make sure that\neverything is actually good and\n\n84\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.010\nthen everything, of course,\nruns inside of RAM.\n\n85\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.200\nSo, verify and\nunderstand that part of the process.\n\n86\n00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.600\nNow what does it look like though,\nwhen you and\n\n87\n00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.230\nI are actually going to see\nthe vices that do this.\n\n88\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.770\nSo here it is, I am in practice\nlabs here and I've gone ahead and\n\n89\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.560\nselected the one for the right exam there\nactually are two Cisco practice labs,\n\n90\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.460\none is for the 100-101.\n\n91\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.380\nYou want the one that says 100-105 and\nthis is in the lab for\n\n92\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.100\nthe initial device configuration.\n\n93\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.390\nSo what we're gonna take a look\nat is this NY access 1 and\n\n94\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.040\nI'm gonna power this thing on\nhere in just a moment, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.990\nSo we want to see this power on\nbecause what we're looking for\n\n96\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.350\nis the output that happens right\nhere when the device is actually on.\n\n97\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.340\nSo it's gonna take just a little bit\nof time for it to actually boot on and\n\n98\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.390\ndo what we actually need to do, okay.\n\n99\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.140\nBut at the very beginning, we'll start\nseeing something come across the screen at\n\n100\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.700\nleast that is my greatest hope is that\nwe'll actually start seeing something come\n\n101\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.930\nacross screen and there we go, okay.\n\n102\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.160\nThis is during this time and\nprocess that we will start seeing or\n\n103\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.910\nstarting to take a look into it and\nit's going through the post process.\n\n104\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.760\nAnd it's now starting to\nreport some information and\n\n105\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.410\nnow notice what it actually says and\n\n106\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.170\nwe'll kind of take a look at this\nagain as it flashes through if we can.\n\n107\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.530\nIts went ahead from\nthe bootstrap into Flash and\n\n108\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.180\nthen it read from Flash,\nthis file right here which is the IOS and\n\n109\n00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.370\nwhat you're seeing here on these little\nat symbols or you may see a pound sign.\n\n110\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.480\nThis is decompressing what you're\nseeing right here in Flash into RAM.\n\n111\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.075\nNow let me change our scale\nin here just a little bit so\n\n112\n00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:03.180\nthat we can see that a little\nbit better here as well, okay.\n\n113\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.620\nSo that's what you're actually seeing and\nnow that may be, as much as I'd like that,\n\n114\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.930\nwe're not gonna be able to see everything\nif we don't pay attention here, okay.\n\n115\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.360\nSo, at this point once it finishes\ndecompressing notice it tells you that\n\n116\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.520\nthe file did get uncompressed and\nI'll have to kind of keep scrolling back.\n\n117\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.880\nAnd it's now installed inside of RAM and\nit tells you what the entry point is and\n\n118\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.570\nthis is where you see the IOS loaded up.\n\n119\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.035\nIt gives you a rights restriction\non what should be happening and\n\n120\n00:07:34.035 --> 00:07:39.408\nof course it starts telling you about\nthe IOS software it self, how big it is,\n\n121\n00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:45.468\nthe file that you're actually using and\nwhether it's actually initialized the IOS.\n\n122\n00:07:45.468 --> 00:07:50.123\nAnd here is some other post things\nthat it's now checking once again for\n\n123\n00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:54.859\nthe actual device itself and then\nwe'll start seeing where now it begins\n\n124\n00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:58.679\nto load up the actual port count,\nand what we're seeing.\n\n125\n00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:02.560\nAnd then it goes into the NV.\n\n126\n00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.740\nRAM okay?\n\n127\n00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.157\nSo notice it says non-volatile\nconfiguration memory, and\n\n128\n00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:12.177\nit says that there's 64 bytes of\nthis that it's actually stored in.\n\n129\n00:08:12.177 --> 00:08:18.599\nSo this is where it's gonna look for\nthat startup-config file, okay?\n\n130\n00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:22.630\nAfter that point, you also see a list and\nseries of hardware serial numbers.\n\n131\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.990\nThis is very important especially\nif you can get to this point.\n\n132\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.390\nIf your device somehow has crashed or\nis no longer stable, and\n\n133\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.990\nyou now need to actually replace\nsomething like the motherboard.\n\n134\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.420\nWell, you have the serial number for\nyour motherboard right here.\n\n135\n00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.750\nOr a replacement for\nthe power supply serial number.\n\n136\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.840\nOr even assembly number if they need it.\n\n137\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.680\nAll that's actually right here inside\nof what you're seeing displayed, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.750\nFrom that point, you'll also,\nof course, see the model number for\n\n139\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.770\nthe switch, and on the switch that we're\ncurrently on for our practice labs here,\n\n140\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:01.750\nthis is gonna be WS for\nwork switch and a C for catalyst 2960.\n\n141\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:07.640\nThis is a 24TCS,\nI thought that was a five for a moment.\n\n142\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.820\nBut it's a CS here, okay?\n\n143\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.692\nSo that means this is a 24 port switch.\n\n144\n00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:16.832\nIt's got a little bit of extra\nstuff on it here on this TC-S here.\n\n145\n00:09:16.832 --> 00:09:21.834\nAnd you'll also see that 2 and\nthen right here, it gives you of course,\n\n146\n00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:27.220\na summary of what it actually sees too,\nwhich of course is the Cisco IOS.\n\n147\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.380\nIt tells you that this is a switch,\nand there's 26 ports on it, two for\n\n148\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.110\nuplink, to actually link to\nanother switch if we need to.\n\n149\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.388\nAnd it tells you the model number.\n\n150\n00:09:37.388 --> 00:09:42.810\nHere is gonna be the IOS\nversion number that you\n\n151\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:48.770\nare looking at which is 15.02SE2,\nand this is the switch image.\n\n152\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.521\nNow of all that, even all this is it\ncan't be important, what we want to make\n\n153\n00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:58.497\nsure that we are preparing for the exam,\nis that we are on at least version 15,\n\n154\n00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:01.359\nwhether we are on the router,\non the switch.\n\n155\n00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.569\nNot every switch will be upgraded.\n\n156\n00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:07.340\nSo my 3560, there is a 15 but\nit's not recommended.\n\n157\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.520\nIt's not as stable as the other one.\n\n158\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.620\nSo even though you might see some that\nare higher, if you go onto the forums and\n\n159\n00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.140\nyou start looking at them like look that's\nfairly unstable at reboot all the time.\n\n160\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.700\nGo back and everybody recognize\nthis one version number.\n\n161\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.407\nAnd as much as you don't want to go back,\nif you need stability,\n\n162\n00:10:23.407 --> 00:10:25.615\nyou might have to go with\na stabler version than go and\n\n163\n00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:28.870\nlet's go with the latest one.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, where do you get these\n\n164\n00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.920\nimages for your device?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great question here.\n\n165\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.570\nWhen you buy the device,\nespecially if you buy it from Cisco,\n\n166\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.110\nit comes along in the service contract.\n\n167\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.790\nSo that you can go to their site and\nyou can download.\n\n168\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.240\nYou type in, and if your account is listed\nas somebody that can download that.\n\n169\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.780\nThen you can go and check out and\n\n170\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.820\ndownload that particular IOS image\nthat you need for your device.\n\n171\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.040\nAnd that's actually a good key here, too.\n\n172\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.800\nCuz I know at the beginning when I first\nstarted learning about this stuff as well\n\n173\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.540\nis I didn't understand that the iOS was\nnot just not a generic operating system.\n\n174\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.910\nThese are actually more specific than\nlike Windows versus Linux, okay?\n\n175\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.410\nThese are specific to the model number.\n\n176\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.300\nSo when you go there,\nif you actually find a 2960 image,\n\n177\n00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.940\nthat's not gonna go on a 2950 router.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n178\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.470\n&gt;&gt; Switch, yeah,\n\n179\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.000\nit's not gonna go on a 29-50 route switch.\n\n180\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.400\nIt's not going to go on a 37.\n\n181\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.890\nIt absolutely has to be\nthe right model number, as well,\n\n182\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.880\nso pay attention there, okay?\n\n183\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.130\nSo, after this point when\neverything is now in RAM,\n\n184\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.840\nit did not find a startup config here.\n\n185\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.230\nSo this is where you press\nto get started here.\n\n186\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.815\nAnd so now it's actually going through,\nand lets see what happens here.\n\n187\n00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:45.330\nThis is where you are going to get to,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.700\nThis of course is gonna be\nthe system configuration dialog box.\n\n189\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.120\nThe initial start up says there\nis no start up config, so\n\n190\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.360\nit's asking whether or not you\nreally want to create one right now.\n\n191\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.270\nAnd if you want to,\nyou simply go through here and\n\n192\n00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.360\nyou start answering the questions\nthat it asks you, okay.\n\n193\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.888\nSo you say yes to this.\n\n194\n00:12:05.888 --> 00:12:10.048\nThat's all you start doing, as then it\ngives you a series of questions, and\n\n195\n00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:13.757\nin the end it will build a simple\nconfiguration file for you, okay.\n\n196\n00:12:13.757 --> 00:12:17.705\nNow, it doesn't mean you can't do that,\nbut we're not gonna do that for\n\n197\n00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:18.990\nat least our show here.\n\n198\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.577\nWhat we are going to do instead, is using\nthe box that they give us to type in,\n\n199\n00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:25.082\nis I'm gonna type in no,\n\n200\n00:12:25.082 --> 00:12:28.899\nand now this is the first place\nwhere we'll be able to focus in.\n\n201\n00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:32.225\nNow I'm going to change\nour screen a little bit,\n\n202\n00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:37.480\nto zoom in and up our scaling so that\nwe can see this just a little bit more.\n\n203\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.840\nThere is a lot more dialog at that point\nbut now we have to pay attention to\n\n204\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.278\nseveral things as we get started\nhere in what we're seeing, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:45.278 --> 00:12:47.410\nWhat you wanna pay attention to,\nof course,\n\n206\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.940\nis gonna be what's reported to you\nright after you typed in the word no.\n\n207\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.150\nNotice it says switch and then you\nessentially have the greater than symbol\n\n208\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.690\nor the arrow,\nwhatever you want to call it is fine.\n\n209\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.230\nYou have the word switch and\nyou have arrow.\n\n210\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.920\nWell both of those represent\nwell something right?\n\n211\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.770\nSwitch represents the device's name.\n\n212\n00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.630\nAnd it gives it a generic\nname at this point.\n\n213\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.940\nIt says I'm a switch.\n\n214\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.645\nIt doesn't try to specify\nit in any other way.\n\n215\n00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:14.670\nDon't call it a switch one or switch A.\n\n216\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.337\nIt just says switch.\n\n217\n00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:20.962\nAnd then you have the other component of\nthis, which is going to be that symbol\n\n218\n00:13:20.962 --> 00:13:25.588\nright there, which like I said,\non your keyboard, on the US keyboard here,\n\n219\n00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:28.459\nit's gonna be the greater than symbol,\nokay?\n\n220\n00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:33.770\nNow when you start seeing that,\nthis particular mode itself is what\n\n221\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:39.180\nis called the user mode, okay,\nthe user mode, at this point.\n\n222\n00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.540\nNow the user mode allows you\nto see information, okay, but\n\n223\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.810\nyou cannot manipulate, change, or,\nessentially, the word configure.\n\n224\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.230\nYou can't really configure anything.\n\n225\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.380\nThe most useful command for you and\n\n226\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.600\nme as we are beginning is\ngonna be the question mark.\n\n227\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.720\nSo if I type in a question mark and\nI press Enter, that is the same as help.\n\n228\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.060\nAnd what help will show me are all\nthe commands that are available at that\n\n229\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.600\nprompt right then.\n\n230\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.440\nAnd they don't call them just commands.\n\n231\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.710\nThey call them Exec commands.\n\n232\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.740\nSo at this particular prompt\nwith the greater than symbol,\n\n233\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:22.220\nyou can actually type in all of these\npossible commands here, and it says More.\n\n234\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.360\nNow with the more, if you start seeing\nthat you need to hit the Space bar.\n\n235\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.580\nAnd that will go from where it\nactually ended up with more and\n\n236\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.490\nfill out the rest of the list\nthat it can go through.\n\n237\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.500\nYou might even hit that two or\n\n238\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:39.260\nthree times depending on what screen\nresolution that you have available to you.\n\n239\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.710\nSo it might actually even be more than\nthat where you're like Space, Space,\n\n240\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.060\nSpace, Space.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie what happens if you hit\n\n241\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.080\nthe Enter key?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n242\n00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.450\nif you hit the Enter key let's\ngo ahead and show that one too.\n\n243\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.250\nSo Daniel actually has\na question which is really good.\n\n244\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.550\nSo now, let's do the same thing again,\nand there we have more.\n\n245\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.810\nSo Daniel says, hey, what happens if you\nhit the Enter key inside of the Space bar?\n\n246\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.060\nNotice what it does instead.\n\n247\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.330\nIt shows you one command at a time.\n\n248\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.636\nAnd that's great as long as you realize\nthat there may be 100 other commands at\n\n249\n00:15:05.636 --> 00:15:06.470\nthe end there.\n\n250\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.521\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That brings up a little question.\n\n251\n00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:09.970\nLet's say I'm in scrolling\nby one at a time.\n\n252\n00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.190\nI found, telnet, that's the one I want.\n\n253\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.290\nI'm kind of stuck in this more.\n\n254\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.820\nHow do I get out of that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n255\n00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.750\none you start doing something like that,\nthen you can do a control,\n\n256\n00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.730\nwell if it allows me, I don't know if this\none actually allows me to do that or not.\n\n257\n00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.690\nThis one doesn't give me the shortcut, but\nnormaly you can do like a control break or\n\n258\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.130\nsomething like a Control Z.\n&gt;&gt; Control Z yeah.\n\n259\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.990\nSo let's see, yeah it doesn't\nallow me to do that in this one.\n\n260\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.176\nSo on that one I can actually do that.\n&gt;&gt; Emulation, that's one.\n\n261\n00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:37.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n262\n00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.950\nthis one you'll actually be\nable to see that, so a Ctrl+Z\n\n263\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.380\nwill kinda break you out, sometimes Ctrl+C\nwill also do the same thing, but just\n\n264\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.630\nrealize you can do something like that\nright then in the middle of this okay?\n\n265\n00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.711\nSo just this user mode, remember it will\nshow you some of the commands, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:57.043\nBut this is really all about\nseeing more than anything else, so\n\n267\n00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:59.749\nthat's what this one allows you to do.\n\n268\n00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:03.126\nAnd you'll see that's probably one of the\nmost prevalent commands you'll ever run.\n\n269\n00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:05.090\nIs what is called the show command.\n\n270\n00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.855\nSo if I type in show and I press that,\nand now it says, hey, look,\n\n271\n00:16:09.855 --> 00:16:12.860\nyou don't have enough here.\n\n272\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.650\nSo in this sense if I type\nin show now it's saying,\n\n273\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.816\nwhy not what other commands are also\nattached to that keyword show?\n\n274\n00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:23.189\nAnd then I can do this and\n\n275\n00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:27.020\nnow I start having where I\nactually need a combination.\n\n276\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.645\nI can do something like show crypto or\nshow clock,\n\n277\n00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.903\nthat's probably a good one at this point.\n\n278\n00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:34.010\nI'm trying to find ones that\nare actually available for us.\n\n279\n00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.760\nAnd the one key one down here\nthat we have available to us\n\n280\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.230\nis something we're already talked about.\n\n281\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.600\nSo we'll do that too and\nit kind of went by.\n\n282\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.157\nSo let me go ahead and\ntype in like show Flash, Oops.\n\n283\n00:16:50.157 --> 00:16:53.024\nApparently I typed it in twice.\n\n284\n00:16:53.024 --> 00:16:56.271\nShow flash, there we go.\n\n285\n00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:58.969\nLet me scroll back down,\nso that we can see this.\n\n286\n00:16:58.969 --> 00:17:04.360\nThis is actually what is in the flash,\nessentially the hard drive of the switch.\n\n287\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.480\nAnd at this point you can see\nwhere I had the stratup config.\n\n288\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.840\n&gt;&gt; What's sort of stratup.\n\n289\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stratup config.\n\n290\n00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:17.263\nAnd you can see where somebody\nactually tried to use the,\n\n291\n00:17:17.263 --> 00:17:19.907\nthey start you config here at some point.\n\n292\n00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:21.944\nBut normally at the very beginning,\n\n293\n00:17:21.944 --> 00:17:25.340\nif there's anything it's\ngoing to be right here.\n\n294\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.404\nDepending on how much flash you have,\n\n295\n00:17:28.404 --> 00:17:32.150\nyou may be able to store\nmultiple iOSs on here.\n\n296\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.415\nBut don't always count on that.\n&gt;&gt; What would be\n\n297\n00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:38.373\nthe purpose of doing that, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; The purpose of doing that is let's say\n\n298\n00:17:38.373 --> 00:17:39.610\nthat you wanted to upgrade.\n\n299\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.360\nYou realize that there was\na newer iOS out there.\n\n300\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.229\nBut you kind of realize something.\n\n301\n00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.400\nIf I do this,\nwhat if it doesn't work, okay?\n\n302\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.456\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm?\n\n303\n00:17:47.456 --> 00:17:49.069\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it doesn't work and\n\n304\n00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.649\nyou don't have an iOS already in flash,\nwell,\n\n305\n00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:54.650\nthat means you have to get\nit on to there somehow.\n\n306\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.010\nSo you just erase the whole thing and\nput the new one on there and\n\n307\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.274\nnow you don't have anything to boot up\nto and your newest version won't work,\n\n308\n00:18:02.274 --> 00:18:04.555\nyou now have to do some fancy other stuff.\n\n309\n00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:07.028\nYou have to change the configuration\nregister, you have to delete that.\n\n310\n00:18:07.028 --> 00:18:11.284\nYou have to pull that back in using\nsome very limited commands to get\n\n311\n00:18:11.284 --> 00:18:15.395\nan operating system on there that\nwill work, and it can be done.\n\n312\n00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:16.479\n&gt;&gt; So you're working yourself a pain.\n\n313\n00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:17.106\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n\n314\n00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:19.569\n[LAUGH] It can be done, but it is painful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:18:19.569 --> 00:18:21.787\n&gt;&gt; It's a painful learning process when\n\n316\n00:18:21.787 --> 00:18:26.511\nyou realize, you mean those commands\nare also case sensitive too, yikes.\n\n317\n00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:27.960\nIt's very slow.\n\n318\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.051\nIt begins to grate on me a little bit.\n\n319\n00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:31.235\nSo you can do something like that.\n\n320\n00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:34.277\nWhere you start to see that as well, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:34.277 --> 00:18:40.349\nThere's also a very special file that's in\nflash normally by default called vlan.dat.\n\n322\n00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:43.170\nNow we haven't gotten in to\nswitch configurations yet.\n\n323\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.957\nBut this essentially is what holds that\nregister of all the VLANs that you create\n\n324\n00:18:47.957 --> 00:18:52.398\nthat will essentially store, so\nit's just your database of your VLANs.\n\n325\n00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:55.551\nAnd if you end up releasing\nthat switch to be repurposed,\n\n326\n00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:59.400\none of the things you want to do\nis you want to delete this file.\n\n327\n00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.120\nDon't delete it if you're still using it,\nbut delete it afterwards if you're\n\n328\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.910\ndone with this, because that's going\nto be central to what you want to do.\n\n329\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.450\nSo you could see where the show command.\n\n330\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.230\nIt does show you quite\na bit of information.\n\n331\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.400\nBut this is not normally where we operate.\n\n332\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.143\nWhat we want to begin to do is to also\nget into what is called Privilege Mode or\n\n333\n00:19:19.143 --> 00:19:23.348\nthey call it Privilege Exec Mode\ntechnically, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:27.100\nAnd the way that we do that is\nwe type in the word Enable.\n\n335\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.030\nWhen we type in enable,\nnotice the change here.\n\n336\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.930\nWe went from of course switch\nwith a greater than symbol and\n\n337\n00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.560\nnow switch with the pound\nsymbol at this point.\n\n338\n00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.540\nSo this is what is called\nprivileged exit mode.\n\n339\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.440\nSo now if I do a question mark here and\nI press Enter,\n\n340\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.540\nI may still see some of the very same\ncommands that are available to me.\n\n341\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.300\nAnd I will also see others,\nbecause it is beginning right here,\n\n342\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.365\nI get access to more things\nthat I can configure.\n\n343\n00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:03.440\nWhereas in Show or in the User mode,\nI can see a lot of things but\n\n344\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.760\nthere may be stuff that I'm\nnot also supposed to see.\n\n345\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:14.000\nSo in the Show they give me a limited\namount of data that I can see whereas\n\n346\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.760\nin the privileged exact mode, I can\npretty much see anything that I want to.\n\n347\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.440\nThere are some things that\nare configurable here, but\n\n348\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.510\nnot everything, okay?\n\n349\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.019\nThere are some commands that allow you to\nclear old process, that allow you to do\n\n350\n00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:31.733\nsomething but overall, though,\nthis is kind of that mode here.\n\n351\n00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:33.954\nMost of the time,\nI have really used it for\n\n352\n00:20:33.954 --> 00:20:36.625\nthe show command more than anything else,\nokay?\n\n353\n00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:40.661\nBut the next mode is probably the one\nthat is the most important mode,\n\n354\n00:20:40.661 --> 00:20:45.990\nwhich is going to be the one for what we\ncall global configuration mode, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.860\nThis one you'll hear everybody\ncall it something different, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.530\nSo a lot of times to get access into it\n\n357\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.930\nall you do is you now\ntype configure terminal.\n\n358\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.403\nAnd when I do that,\nnotice it's a combination command.\n\n359\n00:21:00.403 --> 00:21:02.934\nIt had the word configure,\nthe key word, and then terminal.\n\n360\n00:21:02.934 --> 00:21:09.060\nBut if I type in the word,\nlet's do disable instead.\n\n361\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.406\nNot disable, exit.\n\n362\n00:21:10.406 --> 00:21:12.601\nI'm thinking of something\nelse in my head here.\n\n363\n00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:14.692\nIf I type in exit instead,\n\n364\n00:21:14.692 --> 00:21:21.170\nnotice that it brings me back out to\nthe privilege exempt mode here, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.201\nIf I just type in configure, Notice\n\n366\n00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.440\nthere's actually different\nconfigurations that can be done.\n\n367\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.580\nOne is for terminal.\n\n368\n00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.360\nThe other one of course is for\nmemory, and even network.\n\n369\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.510\nBut the default is terminal here, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.600\nEven though that's the default,\nI press Enter and\n\n371\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.460\nit brings me into the global\nconfiguration here.\n\n372\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.890\nNormally on the Cisco exam,\n\n373\n00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.510\nmake sure you type in configure terminal,\nis what you want to do.\n\n374\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.650\nAnd that technically this command\nis call the global configuration\n\n375\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.120\nthat you want to be, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.630\nNow the reason why this is\nimportant because, this,\n\n377\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:05.200\nthe idea of global configuration means it\naffects the entire switch itself, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.102\nSo when you do a command here,\nit actually affects the entire switch.\n\n379\n00:22:09.102 --> 00:22:13.940\nSo that's why they call it the global\nconfiguration mode at this point.\n\n380\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.500\nSo let's go ahead and see what it is that\nwe can actually configure globally for\n\n381\n00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.790\nour switch that will affect us.\n\n382\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:27.040\nAnd it begins with things like\naccess list, triple A, you name it.\n\n383\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.230\nbooth, we can configure some\nbooth parameters and we need to.\n\n384\n00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:37.371\nWe can even go,\nI'm trying to keep the thing down,\n\n385\n00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:41.924\nand it's, here, let's hit, there we go.\n\n386\n00:22:41.924 --> 00:22:44.937\nYou actually start seeing that\nthere's more and more stuff that\n\n387\n00:22:44.937 --> 00:22:48.618\ncan be configured and you'll notice\nthis one that I've hit more three times,\n\n388\n00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:52.330\nfour times, the list is much\ngreater than what we can configure.\n\n389\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.870\nDaniel, let's go ahead and start\nconfiguring just a few things here so\n\n390\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.490\nthen we can get started.\n\n391\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.880\nInitial switch configuration,\nonce you boot up and you not realize\n\n392\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.710\nI've go to get from user mode and\nthe privileged mode that is enable,\n\n393\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.550\nthen once I'm in privileged mode I need\nto get into global configuration mode.\n\n394\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.391\nThat's gonna be configure terminal.\n\n395\n00:23:10.391 --> 00:23:14.746\nBut one of the first things that we\nnormally want to set up at this point,\n\n396\n00:23:14.746 --> 00:23:17.224\nis we want to protect our device, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:17.224 --> 00:23:20.520\nSo we're gonna setup two different\npasswords is what we're gonna do.\n\n398\n00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.010\nAnd this is the initial kind of device\nconfiguration in security, okay?\n\n399\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:29.182\nSo when we start doing this, what I\nwant to do is I want to go ahead and\n\n400\n00:23:29.182 --> 00:23:30.630\njust set up that.\n\n401\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.370\nI don't want everybody to be able\nto get into privilege except mode,\n\n402\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.108\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n403\n00:23:35.108 --> 00:23:36.699\n&gt;&gt; They get to user mode, that's fine,\n\n404\n00:23:36.699 --> 00:23:39.055\nbut I don't wanna them to get\nthem into privilege mode.\n\n405\n00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:43.960\nSo I can just say,\nI want to set an enable password.\n\n406\n00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.880\nSo if I type in Enable Password,\nthen I can actually go in and\n\n407\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.270\ntype in a password here, and\nwe'll call it cisco1 at this point.\n\n408\n00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.232\nAnd I'm just going to use cisco1 or\ncisco2 just to keep it easy,\n\n409\n00:23:55.232 --> 00:23:59.211\nbecause if I start doing something\ncomplex, then I'll mess up.\n\n410\n00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.729\n[LAUGH] So for you, you should do\nsomething more complex for this.\n\n411\n00:24:02.729 --> 00:24:04.767\nBut for right now let's just do that.\n\n412\n00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:06.942\nNow, what this password allows me to do,\n\n413\n00:24:06.942 --> 00:24:09.710\nof course,\nis it says that I get into user mode.\n\n414\n00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.870\nThat's fine.\n\n415\n00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.200\nBut now, let's go ahead and see.\n\n416\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.370\nLet me exit out of this.\n\n417\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.260\nI'm just hitting exit a couple of times.\n\n418\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.560\nSo I am now out at the user mode.\n\n419\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.270\nIf I typed in enable here,\nnotice it asked me for a password.\n\n420\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.380\nSo cisco1.\n\n421\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.110\nWhat I want to be able to do.\n\n422\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.650\nAnd now I am back in.\n\n423\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.080\nSo I've just protected myself.\n\n424\n00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.250\nNot the greatest protection in the world,\nbut it'll stop somebody that doesn't know.\n\n425\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n426\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.210\nBut if you're already kind\nof knowing a little bit,\n\n427\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.230\nyou have some access to the switch.\n\n428\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.540\nThere is one little problem with that,\nisn't there Ronnie?\n\n429\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.190\n&gt;&gt; What is that problem?\n\n430\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.180\n&gt;&gt; The problem is that they store this\n\n431\n00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.570\npassword in the startup configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n432\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.880\n&gt;&gt; And it's in plain text.\n\n433\n00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n434\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.950\nlet's show that right now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n435\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the way that we can verify\n\n436\n00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.660\nwhat Daniel is talking about is now,\nremember, we didn't have a startup config,\n\n437\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.400\nbut we're essentially starting\nto build it right now.\n\n438\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.560\nSo what that actually is, what we're doing\nright now is called running configuration.\n\n439\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.460\nSo it's running and\n\n440\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.720\nwe are starting to configure.\n\n441\n00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n442\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.510\nSo now if I type in show and\n\n443\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.990\nundo running-config, let's see what\nDaniel is talking about right here.\n\n444\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.140\nNotice there it is.\n\n445\n00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.520\nDaniel, you are right.\n\n446\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.140\nIt is stored right there in plain text.\n\n447\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.640\nRight out in the open.\n&gt;&gt; For the whole world to see.\n\n448\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.758\n&gt;&gt; So yes, if I run this command,\n\n449\n00:25:24.758 --> 00:25:28.180\nsomebody's walking by my shoulder, they\nshoulder surf, they see it right there.\n\n450\n00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.970\nAnd now we are pretty\nmuch in trouble okay?\n\n451\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:37.110\nSo we need to protect this and\none of the ways we can protect this is any\n\n452\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:42.460\nuser configured password, we can go ahead\nand we can also encrypt this as well.\n\n453\n00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.460\nAnd the way that we do that, let me get\nback into global configuration mode.\n\n454\n00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.921\nSo configure terminal and then,\n\n455\n00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:56.035\nI can do service password-encrypt.\n\n456\n00:25:56.035 --> 00:25:58.030\nMake sure I set the, yeah, encryption.\n\n457\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.340\nI always forget encrypt during encryption.\n\n458\n00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.520\nSo service password-encryption.\n\n459\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.820\nAnd if you just get the next line\nwhen you configure it you're fine.\n\n460\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.230\nIf you get to the next line and it shows\nyou like there's something wrong here.\n\n461\n00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.030\n&gt;&gt; I think it usually gives you\n\n462\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.620\na little carrot that says this\nis where the problem was found.\n\n463\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.160\n&gt;&gt; And you hope that that's exactly what\n\n464\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.050\nit is, but if you're like me,\nyou're like you don't know exactly what.\n\n465\n00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.190\nI does happen.\n\n466\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.730\nSo now I've actually encrypted that.\n\n467\n00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.730\nSo let's take a look at that as well.\n\n468\n00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.510\nShow running-config.\n\n469\n00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.030\nAnd now let's take\na look at what happened.\n\n470\n00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.640\nLook at that Daniel,\nwe have now gone ahead and\n\n471\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.320\nput an encryption on that password, okay?\n\n472\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.960\nAnd once we put an encryption\non that password Daniel,\n\n473\n00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.970\nthis encryption even though it works for\nus, okay, it's not a strong password.\n\n474\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:48.330\nI think you can go on to the web and\nif you typed in Cisco level 7 password,\n\n475\n00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.530\nwhat you see right here.\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n\n476\n00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.570\n&gt;&gt; It'll take half a second and a.\n\n477\n00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.830\nBut overall though it gives\nyou what we call of course\n\n478\n00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.210\nover the shoulder surfing protection.\n&gt;&gt; Well for\n\n479\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.690\nthe uninitiated that don't know how\nto look up those types of things,\n\n480\n00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.780\nat least it gives you some form of.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n481\n00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.490\nSo that's what it really does.\n\n482\n00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.400\nNow watch, you see,\n\n483\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.910\noops, what did I do there.\n&gt;&gt; You've done it\n\n484\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.000\nnow Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n485\n00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.690\nIf anybody can do something,\nit's gonna be me here.\n\n486\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.010\nSo I even typed in something wrong and\nit still kicked me out,\n\n487\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.467\nwhich is what I wanted it to do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:19.307\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n489\n00:27:19.307 --> 00:27:20.770\nSo now that we have that-\n\n490\n00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.320\ncan we actually do something\nstronger with this password though?\n\n491\n00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.220\nYes.\n\n492\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.104\nAnd if you do that-\nlet's go into configure-\n\n493\n00:27:30.104 --> 00:27:34.770\nterminal- instead of actually\njust doing an enable password\n\n494\n00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.830\nthe stronger one is what is\ncalled enable secret, okay.\n\n495\n00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.510\nSo if I do the same thing, Cisco.\n\n496\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.430\nLet's just do the same password so\nthat way we can compare it and see.\n\n497\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.720\nThat automatically encrypts that\npassword for us to do this.\n\n498\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.390\nSo it says you've chosen to, okay.\n\n499\n00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.960\nIt's just mad because I did the same one,\nbut I wanna see the comparison.\n\n500\n00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.140\nSo it says not recommended, are you sure,\n\n501\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.300\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure,\n\n502\n00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:02.980\nI'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; Let's\n\n503\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.941\nsee.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n504\n00:28:03.941 --> 00:28:05.368\n&gt;&gt; It says, this is not recommended,\n\n505\n00:28:05.368 --> 00:28:08.061\nre-enter the enable [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I think you hit Enter and\n\n506\n00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:12.010\nthat's what it kicked you out.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try it again.\n\n507\n00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:17.320\nEnable secret CISCO One, not that one.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n508\n00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.070\nthere we go.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n509\n00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.670\nlet's see that's still\nsaying the same thing, but\n\n510\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.396\nlet's see if it actually\ntook it this time.\n\n511\n00:28:21.396 --> 00:28:27.148\nSo show running-configuration,\n\n512\n00:28:27.148 --> 00:28:32.190\nI misspelled something.\n\n513\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.220\nShow running-configuration.\n\n514\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.430\nIt's running dash config.\n\n515\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.918\nSee so my mind-\n&gt;&gt; Still running.\n\n516\n00:28:42.918 --> 00:28:45.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And actually that's something good to\n\n517\n00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.010\nactually think about because there\nare abbreviations here that can be done.\n\n518\n00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.080\nBut this is what I wanted to show you,\nokay?\n\n519\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.650\nSo now notice where it says enable secret.\n\n520\n00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.700\nLook how long this particular\nencryption actually is by comparison.\n\n521\n00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.886\nAs we start to do something\nlike this as well, okay?\n\n522\n00:29:00.886 --> 00:29:04.410\nSo now when you're starting to see\nwhen we're beginning to protect and\n\n523\n00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.075\nyou know little bit more now\nwhen it comes across it,\n\n524\n00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:11.175\nwell which password will it take well\nthat's actually a good question so\n\n525\n00:29:11.175 --> 00:29:15.760\nlet's go head and\nsee if I now get out of this thing.\n\n526\n00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.660\nSo here I am I'm in user mode okay?\n\n527\n00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.110\nThis is the only problem right, so if I do\nthis enable, I actually had the password\n\n528\n00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.290\nexactly the same for enable password,\nas well as the secret.\n\n529\n00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:32.360\nSo but usually what happens of course\nis it defaults to the higher one is\n\n530\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.520\nwhat it does, so Cisco 1 is the password,\nand it should let me right in.\n\n531\n00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.350\nI probably should have changed it so\nwe could see that.\n\n532\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.640\nI wanted to see the comparison overall.\n\n533\n00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.290\nBut by default, if you enabled\nboth of them it's going to take\n\n534\n00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:50.260\nonly the one that's stronger instead and\nuse that one is what it's going to do.\n\n535\n00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.700\nNow that we've got a little\nbit of configuration here,\n\n536\n00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.680\nDan, and we've been using\nthe show running config to\n\n537\n00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.590\nshow us how we're actually building this,\nand doing stuff.\n\n538\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.450\nThere's still a lot more for us to do,\nbut this is actually a good point.\n\n539\n00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.450\nThere's one more thing that I want to go\nahead and do a configuration too, okay?\n\n540\n00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:11.620\nSo, let's do a configure terminal.\n\n541\n00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.860\nCause I did forget one thing\nthat I always tell everybody\n\n542\n00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.430\nyou should do as a standard habit.\n\n543\n00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.010\nOk?\n\n544\n00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.020\nWhich is you want to change\nthe name of the switch.\n\n545\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.070\nSo I always do something like switch one.\n\n546\n00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.910\nLike this.\n\n547\n00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.000\nYou can type in host name and\n\n548\n00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.770\nnow notice where the prop changed from\nthe original to what you see there, okay?\n\n549\n00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.990\nAnd that's important as we get into\nwhat we're about to take a look at.\n\n550\n00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.940\nAnd a little bit next\nin our next task here.\n\n551\n00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.870\nWe'll see that setting up that host\nname is one of the more important things\n\n552\n00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:45.820\nthat we can do.\n\n553\n00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.510\nEspecially for security and setting up\nthe stuff that we've done right here.\n\n554\n00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.260\nBut Daniel it looks like I have come\nto the point where we are running\n\n555\n00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.210\nout of time.\n\n556\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.240\nSo we'll have to save that for\nanother episode.\n\n557\n00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Well not a problem Mr. Rominus Maximus.\n\n558\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.685\nWe can definitely do that.\n\n559\n00:30:58.685 --> 00:31:02.080\nThere's obviously a little bit going\non when you need to set up a brand new\n\n560\n00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.270\nswitch or if you bought a switch and\nyou need to start from the beginning and\n\n561\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.420\nload a new operating system\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n562\n00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.960\nYou're starting from scratch.\n\n563\n00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.060\nAs a bit of configuration,\nas Ronnie said, you want a name it,\n\n564\n00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.820\nyou wanna add some security to it.\n\n565\n00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:18.300\nAll viable things so that you can get this\nthing to more of an operating capacity.\n\n566\n00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.960\nSo we're gonna have to wait till\npart two to see what else he has on\n\n567\n00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.590\nthe chopping block.\n\n568\n00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.720\nAs for this episode, though,\nwe've gotta call it quits.\n\n569\n00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.010\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today.\n\n570\n00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.180\nWe do thank you for watching, as always.\n\n571\n00:31:27.180 -->

00:00:06.418\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.418 --> 00:00:08.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.868\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:17.320\ngreetings everyone, and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.410\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.540\nin today's episode we continue on\nwith more in our CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.400\nJoining us back in the studio,\nlending his expertise to us,\n\n10\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.120\nour good friend Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.030\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.210\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel,\n\n13\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.240\nas we continue to learn more about,\nof course, getting ready for\n\n14\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.550\nour CCENT exam, as well as getting\nsome hands on practice into\n\n15\n00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.950\nthe command line interface of\nCISCO routers and switches.\n\n16\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.210\nAnd we were picking up partway\nthrough a lab that we were doing, so\n\n17\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.950\nthat you did get a chance to\ninteract with the interface\n\n18\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.260\nas well as learn a little\nbit more about it.\n\n19\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.350\nSo let me review what\nwe've actually done so\n\n20\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.970\nfar, and then we'll go ahead and\ncontinue through this, okay?\n\n21\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.570\nSo right here on my screen I am actually\nconnected in to our practice labs.\n\n22\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.000\nRemember that you can do\nthe very same labs at home,\n\n23\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.310\nas you actually do have access to that.\n\n24\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.600\nSo here it is.\n\n25\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.220\nWe've gone through just some basics\nwhere we've showed you the difference in\n\n26\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.670\nthe different prompts.\n\n27\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.220\nThe enable, the privilege exec mode,\nthe user mode, and\n\n28\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.750\nof course the global\nconfiguration mode as well.\n\n29\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750\nWe showed you the use of the help,\nwhich is actually very much\n\n30\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.120\na big part of you learning about the way\nthat CISCO commands end up working.\n\n31\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.970\nAnd then from that point we started\nconfiguring some of the different\n\n32\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.160\nthings that we could configure.\n\n33\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.170\nSo one of the first things that we did is,\nas I scroll back down through here,\n\n34\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.910\nas I'm taking a look at our configuration,\nwe created the enable password here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.190\nSo remember that for us to be able to\nmove from user mode into, of course,\n\n36\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.120\nprivilege exec mode,\nwe need to have a password.\n\n37\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.280\nNow can you do it without it?\n\n38\n00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.000\nYes, but it's not recommended,\nbecause this way,\n\n39\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.900\neven if somebody is able to see\nsomething and run some show\n\n40\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.030\ncommands to show something, it's\na limited amount of what they can see.\n\n41\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.690\nOnce they enter into privilege exec mode,\nthey get to see a lot more information.\n\n42\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.900\nBut at this point, if you want to protect\nthe difference between those that can see\n\n43\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.120\nsome verses those can see a lot,\nyou want to go ahead and setup a password.\n\n44\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.510\nEven when we entered in the password,\nwe ended up seeing something that, when we\n\n45\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.780\nrun a command called show running-config,\nwe saw that\n\n46\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.540\nthe password was actually saved in this\nmanner, but it was actually unencrypted.\n\n47\n00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.550\nThen we ran that idea of\nthe service password-encryption,\n\n48\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.510\nand that allowed me to do,\nessentially protect or\n\n49\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.180\nobfuscate the password itself using\nwhat they call Level 7 encryption.\n\n50\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.980\nBut we also showed another type\nof encryption that you can use,\n\n51\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.500\nwhich is considered a Level 5 encryption.\n\n52\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.290\nNow even though this is stronger, and\nyou can see by the very length and\n\n53\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.890\nthe complexity of this stuff,\nit is stronger than what Level 7 is, but\n\n54\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.740\ntoday it's probably not as\nstrong as we'd like it to be.\n\n55\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.140\nIt does still have some advantages here.\n\n56\n00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.180\nNotice that they have these\ndollar signs up here upfront, and\n\n57\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.880\nthat tells you that this is\na salted hash value as well.\n\n58\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.970\nThat means that they've added in some\nrandom bits to help obscure this password\n\n59\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.390\neven more.\n\n60\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.440\nSo that's what we configured there, too.\n\n61\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.900\nAt the very end of this, we also showed\nyou how to save this configuration so\n\n62\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.890\nthat it moved from what we call\nthe running config, which is just in RAM,\n\n63\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.010\nto now saving it to a file\nin the startup config, too,\n\n64\n00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.700\nby issuing the copy\nrunning-config startup-config.\n\n65\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.330\nThat means copy what's in RAM\ninto that file, and that way\n\n66\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.570\nthe configuration will be persistent\neven if you reboot the computer.\n\n67\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.290\nNow I want to make sure that we\ncan emphasize this here, at least,\n\n68\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.640\nlet me show you this once more time.\n\n69\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.010\nSo before,\nwhen we did the initial startup,\n\n70\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.315\nremember that without any configuration\nat all, the boot process looks like this.\n\n71\n00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:00.960\nWe're following along the yellow line,\nright?\n\n72\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.250\nWe go through POST configuration\nregister right here.\n\n73\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.250\nOnce it actually sets it up that\neverything is good by default,\n\n74\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.385\nit tries to find a copy of the iOS\nthat's compressed on something.\n\n75\n00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:13.083\nWe're just using flash at this point,\n\n76\n00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:16.020\ncuz we're not gonna get\ninto the other two yet.\n\n77\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.140\nIt finds a copy of that file, it\ndecompresses it and it loads it into RAM.\n\n78\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.582\nOnce it loads it into RAM,\n\n79\n00:04:22.582 --> 00:04:27.239\nthe next step in that process is to locate\nthe startup-config in what we call NVRAM,\n\n80\n00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:30.144\nwhich is again,\npersistent through reboots here.\n\n81\n00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:32.495\nBut at the very initial time,\n\n82\n00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:37.510\nthere is no startup-config file,\nso this NVRAM is empty.\n\n83\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.149\nSo instead, it dumps you out to where it\nsays, hey, do you want to start up, and\n\n84\n00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:44.620\nyou can create a basic startup-config.\n\n85\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.280\nBut we've already done that, so\nwhat is the process that's different now?\n\n86\n00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.200\nThe process that's different now is\nthat we run through the same steps here.\n\n87\n00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.720\nSame thing, POST,\nConfiguration Register, look for\n\n88\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.880\nthe iOS, decompresses it,\nloads it into RAM.\n\n89\n00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.830\nThen it says, hey, look,\nI'm looking for the startup-config and\n\n90\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.920\nnow there's a startup-config.\n\n91\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.360\nAnd what happens at that point is,\nit takes that file and\n\n92\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.610\nnow loads it on top of the iOS.\n\n93\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.970\nSo now we have a preconfigured,\nour operating system, at least\n\n94\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.860\nconfigured with the information that we\nwanted on there at the very beginning.\n\n95\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.310\nSo we're not gonna get dumped at\nthe setup again, which is good,\n\n96\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.350\nbecause it means that now I don't have\nto retype in everything that I did.\n\n97\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.604\nI can now just have it loaded up and\nready to go, and\n\n98\n00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:33.550\nit operates the way that\nwe expect it to operate.\n\n99\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.840\nSo those are the fundamental differences,\n\n100\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.040\nregular start up versus\nthe initial startup.\n\n101\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.020\nIf you end up at the startup again,\njust at the beginning, it probably\n\n102\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.550\nmeans when you did the running config,\nand somehow you rebooted the switch.\n\n103\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.210\nAnd you can do that by typing in reload\nat the end, and then saying, yes,\n\n104\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.530\nyou want to reload it, and you do that.\n\n105\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.630\nThen if you get dumped out here again,\n\n106\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.420\nit means you probably did not save your\nrunning config to the startup config.\n\n107\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.190\nNow that's kind of a little bit\nof troubleshooting that we're\n\n108\n00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.470\nalso gonna get a hint at\ndoing in the future, as well.\n\n109\n00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.480\nSo sometimes that stuff does happen,\nespecially when you're in a hurry.\n\n110\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.920\nBut that's part of getting ready for\n\n111\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.170\nthe CISCO exams that you have\nto be willing to work with.\n\n112\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.253\nQuick, make sure you do everything.\n\n113\n00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:26.170\nHey, it's it, you have to confirm in your\nmind very quickly that, did I do that,\n\n114\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.840\ndid I do that, did I not do that.\n\n115\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.660\nAnd then if you didn't,\ndon't go ahead and just run the command.\n\n116\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.380\nVerify again and do it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it 's second nature.\n\n117\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.570\nIf I issued a command and\nI knew it was right,\n\n118\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.410\nthen you can abbreviate these\ncommands with like copy run start.\n\n119\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.600\nThere's also write mem.\n\n120\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.020\nIs there a difference between the two,\npractically?\n\n121\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, in reality,\n\n122\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.600\nthe way that it goes is that the older\none that Daniel has just mentioned,\n\n123\n00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.070\nwrite mem, which is actually for\nwrite memory, and\n\n124\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.580\nthat means write it to a file.\n&gt;&gt; It is supposed to be deprecated,\n\n125\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.940\nactually, back in like 12.1 or 12.2\n&gt;&gt; It's awhile ago.\n\n126\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.860\n&gt;&gt; It was supposed to be deprecated.\n\n127\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.400\nIt still works, which is kind of funny.\n\n128\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.810\nIt still works because people\nhave been doing it all the time,\n\n129\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.010\nwhere you can do something like this.\n\n130\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.270\nSo it still works, but the official\nstatus is that it's deprecated,\n\n131\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.850\ncompared to what Daniel\nis mentioning here,\n\n132\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.380\nwhich is gonna be the copy running-config,\nstartup-config.\n\n133\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.090\nAnd Daniel just kind of let\nyou in also on a clue here\n\n134\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.460\nthat you can abbreviate\nthese commands as well.\n\n135\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.570\nSo just like what Daniel is saying,\nif we wanted to do this even right here.\n\n136\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.030\nLet me start actually typing here,\ncopy run start.\n\n137\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.430\nThat's actually a perfectly fine\nabbreviation for what Daniel was saying,\n\n138\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.880\nand now notice it's like, hey,\nwhere do you want to copy this to?\n\n139\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.220\nIt now sees that startup-config.\n\n140\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.323\nAnd I can override it, and\nwe can actually go ahead and do that.\n\n141\n00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:53.320\nSo Daniel, as fast as that is, right?\n\n142\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.039\nRemember write mem?\n\n143\n00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:57.900\nI can even just do something\nlike a wr like this.\n\n144\n00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.800\nAnd now notice it doesn't even ask me,\nhey, do I want to do that?\n\n145\n00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.023\nIt just says, yeah, I wrote it.\n\n146\n00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:02.203\nI'm done\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's super fast.\n\n147\n00:08:02.203 --> 00:08:03.473\n&gt;&gt; That's super fast.\n\n148\n00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:05.370\nSo you may see them.\n\n149\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.830\nNow, when it comes to the exam though.\n&gt;&gt; They might not take it, right?\n\n150\n00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.780\n&gt;&gt; They might not take it,\n\n151\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.476\nso always do instead\nthat copy running-config,\n\n152\n00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.970\nstartup-config and make sure that\nyou enter it in that way, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.970\nI'm going to be trying to remember,\nDaniel, throughout this, I'm gonna try and\n\n154\n00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.030\ntype out all the commands in the way\nthat they should officially be learned.\n\n155\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.630\nBut you'll probably see\nme slip after a while and\n\n156\n00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.640\nI'll start using these abbreviations.\n\n157\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.020\nAnd I don't mean to, but\n\n158\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.533\nit's just difficult once you get faster.\n&gt;&gt; It's not that they necessarily won't\n\n159\n00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:36.090\naccept the abbreviation, but you need\nto test that out before you commit to\n\n160\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.820\nanything when you're in that testing mode.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n161\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.606\n&gt;&gt; And make sure, try your copy,\n\n162\n00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:42.405\nrun start, and does it write?\n\n163\n00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:44.120\nTry a WR, does it right.\n\n164\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.160\nIf it does, then you're good to go.\n\n165\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.917\nIf not,\nyou need to know that full command,\n\n166\n00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.723\nbecause that might be all that it accepts,\nso\n\n167\n00:08:48.723 --> 00:08:50.658\nyou've got to be aware of those things.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n168\n00:08:50.658 --> 00:08:53.060\nthat's a great exam point to make, Daniel.\n\n169\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.510\nWe're not saying that you can't use these\nabbreviated forms that you'll end up\n\n170\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.030\nseeing sometimes.\n\n171\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.993\nBut what you will end up though seeing is\nthat some of the simulations that you get\n\n172\n00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:05.010\ninto or some of the commands that\nyou get into having to type,\n\n173\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.391\nif it accepts it, it will.\n\n174\n00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.897\nBut there's sometimes where you'll go,\nI know this and then you're like, okay,\n\n175\n00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:10.990\nit's not working.\n\n176\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.851\nThat means you won't needed to type\nout the entire command instead, and\n\n177\n00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:17.014\nI've run into that a time or two before.\n\n178\n00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.632\nAll right, so Daniel, here we\nare pretty much ready to go at this\n\n179\n00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:25.440\nparticular point and make sure that\neverything else is actually set up here.\n\n180\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.325\nSo what do we want to do, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:29.025\nWell, we've got a couple of\nthings that we need to do.\n\n182\n00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:33.685\nOne of course is to set up what we call\nremote access to this switch, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:33.685 --> 00:09:35.786\nSo that's one of the basics here, right?\n\n184\n00:09:35.786 --> 00:09:40.300\nSo once we get a little bit set up, so\nnormally here's what I would do with\n\n185\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.115\na brand new switch that\ncomes into my office.\n\n186\n00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:46.401\nI would go ahead and erase whatever\nwas on it at that point, and\n\n187\n00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:50.100\nI would get that startup config\nout of there as much as I can.\n\n188\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.317\nAnd then from that point, start this\ninitial configuration just like I'm doing\n\n189\n00:09:54.317 --> 00:09:56.372\nand add in the stuff that I normally do.\n\n190\n00:09:56.372 --> 00:09:59.782\nAnd the only other thing that I did\nnot mention in our review here,\n\n191\n00:09:59.782 --> 00:10:02.473\nis the host name where I\nswitched it to SW1, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:02.473 --> 00:10:05.210\nSo you did see that in\nthe previous episode, and\n\n193\n00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.750\nnow we're continuing to move from there.\n\n194\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.948\nThe other thing is before I go ahead and\nnow put this into a networking closet\n\n195\n00:10:11.948 --> 00:10:15.031\nsomewhere, I'll also want\nto enable remote access.\n\n196\n00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.400\nCuz in all reality, even though I\ncould configure the whole thing,\n\n197\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.998\nif I need to get it up and\nrunning quickly, okay, and\n\n198\n00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:23.800\nthen I wanna do some\nconfiguration later on.\n\n199\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.690\nI want to do it from the comfort of\n\n200\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.590\nair conditioning in my office.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.200\n&gt;&gt; And not necessarily a place\n\n202\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.340\nthat might be like 61 degrees depending\non the air conditioning you have.\n\n203\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.380\nOr if the air conditioning\nis broken there and\n\n204\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.480\nthere's like 19-\n&gt;&gt; 91 degrees.\n\n205\n00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Different servers and it's 91 degrees.\n\n206\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.690\nI don't want that.\n\n207\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.701\nSo instead, I wanna get it to a point\nwhere I can just go ahead and\n\n208\n00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:47.500\nget it mounted into the rack, plugged\ninto network and ready to go, okay?\n\n209\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.560\nThat is pretty much the key in the way\nthat I'd want to do this, right?\n\n210\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.110\nSo now that we have something like this,\n\n211\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.670\nokay, what we want to do is we've\ngot to get this ready then.\n\n212\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.557\nSo the first thing that I am going to\ndo is I am gonna go into my global\n\n213\n00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:02.632\nconfiguration.\n\n214\n00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:08.020\nThen we're gonna set up an IP\naddress is what we're gonna do.\n\n215\n00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.240\nAnd we're gonna do this again in another\nlab, but let's go ahead and set this up.\n\n216\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.228\nAnd the reason why we need to,\nif I need remote access into it,\n\n217\n00:11:14.228 --> 00:11:16.362\nI can't do it without an IP address.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n218\n00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:18.770\n&gt;&gt; So it has to have an IP address.\n\n219\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.723\nAnd this is, let's see, I actually need\nto do this on a virtual interface,\n\n220\n00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:28.361\nwhich is going to be interface vlan 1,\nokay?\n\n221\n00:11:28.361 --> 00:11:32.550\nI'm putting an IP address on the switch\nitself so that I can do this.\n\n222\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.400\nNow I can't put it on an interface.\n\n223\n00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.090\nOn switches,\nyou can try to go into the interface\n\n224\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.920\nfast ethernet zero slash zero or\ngig interface zero slash zero.\n\n225\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.510\nIt's not gonna let you put an IP address\n\n226\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.250\non there at least to\nconfigure it by default.\n\n227\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:48.950\nCan you change it?\n\n228\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.710\nOn layer three switch you can,\nlayer two, not so much.\n\n229\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.360\nBut at the basic here,\nwhen we configure interface VLAN 1,\n\n230\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.720\nthat is a virtual interface and\n\n231\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.820\nthat's actually representative of saying,\nit's the IP address of that device.\n\n232\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.030\nThat's what we're essentially saying,\nokay?\n\n233\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.770\nOnce I do this, to type an IP address,\n\n234\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.220\nthe great thing is most of\nthese commands are intuitive.\n\n235\n00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.940\nIf I need an IP address,\nI just type in ip address and\n\n236\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.242\nthen I have to type in\nthe address that I need.\n\n237\n00:12:17.242 --> 00:12:21.631\nSo I'm gonna do 192.168.16.,\n\n238\n00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:26.026\nI'm just gonna do a 2 at this point, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:28.660\nAnd then I need the subnet mask.\n\n240\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.201\nAll right, so now that I have that\nIP address set up here on switches\n\n241\n00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:38.418\non their interfaces, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:38.418 --> 00:12:40.975\nBy default on the physical interfaces,\n\n243\n00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:44.518\nevery single interface is\nturned on by default, okay?\n\n244\n00:12:44.518 --> 00:12:46.820\nSo what about virtual interfaces?\n\n245\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.270\nUsually on virtual interfaces,\nthey are not turned on.\n\n246\n00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.460\nSo we have to issue what we\ncall a no shutdown command.\n\n247\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.080\nAnd this means administratively\ngo ahead and turn it on, okay?\n\n248\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.660\nSo it can now be ready to listen for\ncalls, do what it needs to and\n\n249\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.830\neverything else that we also need\nto make sure that we do here, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.200\nNow once we have the IP address on there,\n\n251\n00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.130\nnow we need to configure it for\nremote access to the switch.\n\n252\n00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.060\nNow when we do this,\n\n253\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.160\nwe probably don't want to use\na unsecured type of connection.\n\n254\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.540\nUsually, the default that\nCisco does is Telnet,\n\n255\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.980\nokay, which is just plain\ntext going across the wire.\n\n256\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.253\nAnybody that can put a packet\nsniffer on the wire,\n\n257\n00:13:27.253 --> 00:13:31.221\nmessages will pretty much get caught, and\nthat's pretty much the way it's gonna be.\n\n258\n00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:33.207\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat this is issued and\n\n259\n00:13:33.207 --> 00:13:36.210\nthat is actually gonna be\nencrypted at the same time.\n\n260\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.610\nSo at the very beginning here, there's\nseveral different things that we need to\n\n261\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.150\nconfigure on the switch for\nthe initial one, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.265\nBecause of what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna generate some encryption keys.\n\n263\n00:13:46.265 --> 00:13:51.468\nI need to tag that encryption key and\nwith something that's specific and\n\n264\n00:13:51.468 --> 00:13:54.804\nthat includes the host name and\na domain name.\n\n265\n00:13:54.804 --> 00:13:58.865\nAnd that will give me the individuality as\nit runs through the algorithm that says\n\n266\n00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:00.974\nthis is unique to my network here, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:04.020\nSo now I have a host name,\nwhich is exactly what I need.\n\n268\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:10.282\nI now need to set up a domain name,\nwhich is gonna be ip domain-name and\n\n269\n00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:15.284\nthis is gonna be for\npractice-labs here .com, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:15.284 --> 00:14:17.370\nNow you can set up whatever you want to.\n\n271\n00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.890\nI think in the practice labs,\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n272\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.560\nI'm trying at least as much as possible\nto rumor to follow the steps that are in\n\n273\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.580\nthere so that you can follow along\nas well, to help you out here.\n\n274\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.550\nBut what is this?\n\n275\n00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.437\nNow that means the name of the switch,\nright, Daniel, is what-\n\n276\n00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:36.590\n&gt;&gt; sw1.practice-labs.com.\n\n277\n00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.390\n&gt;&gt; So now,\n\n278\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.240\nonce we have that, we're ready to generate\nencryption keys for this connection, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.147\nThe way that this is done\nis that you will have to do\n\n280\n00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:52.759\ncrypto-key, If I can do it.\n\n281\n00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:55.410\nSo it's either crypto-key or\ncrypto key here.\n\n282\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:00.170\nNow, if I'm not ever sure, what I\ncan do is go do a question mark, and\n\n283\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.050\nthat says, hey, look Ronnie,\nyou didn't do that right.\n\n284\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.610\nNotice it's pointing right at that dash,\nDaniel,\n\n285\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.246\nis what you're actually seeing there.\n&gt;&gt; It's saying this is where I found there\n\n286\n00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:09.285\nto be an error.\n\n287\n00:15:09.285 --> 00:15:12.942\nAnd so it actually is telling you\na little bit extra other than you just\n\n288\n00:15:12.942 --> 00:15:14.510\ngot something wrong.\n\n289\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.690\nYou got it right up to this point.\n\n290\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.340\nThat's where you went astray.\n\n291\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.720\nSo if your commands aren't coming out\nright and it tells you it's down the road,\n\n292\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.270\nwell you at least should know what\nyou are getting right versus what\n\n293\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.480\nyou're getting wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n294\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.000\nat this point here I did it\nagain with just the word crypto.\n\n295\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.760\nAnd now look at it, it's essentially\nleading me on to see, saying,\n\n296\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.330\nhey all right, so\nhere's the command that I needed.\n\n297\n00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:41.170\nSo this is gonna be crypto key and\nthen the term here is generate, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.800\nNow when I go ahead and\ntype in crypto key generate and\n\n299\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.339\noops, hold on, sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Incomplete command.\n\n300\n00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:52.190\nThere's another-\n&gt;&gt; crypto key generate, and\n\n301\n00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.900\nthis would be RSA.\n\n302\n00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.964\nThat's what I forgot, the type of\nencryption here that we're gonna do.\n\n303\n00:15:57.964 --> 00:15:58.916\n&gt;&gt; You gotta really hand it to\n\n304\n00:15:58.916 --> 00:15:59.790\nthe people at Cisco.\n\n305\n00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.026\nThey've done a really good job.\n\n306\n00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:01.963\nForget the test.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:16:01.963 --> 00:16:02.954\n&gt;&gt; Speaking practically,\n\n308\n00:16:02.954 --> 00:16:05.461\nYou're sitting behind a switch,\nor sitting behind a router.\n\n309\n00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:09.866\nYou're configuring and\nyou're making some small mistakes,\n\n310\n00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:12.890\nbut it's giving you some help [INAUDIBLE].\n\n311\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.540\nHey, you didn't quite finish that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n312\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.290\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you messed up right here.\n\n313\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.613\nYou got that lovely question mark which,\nmm,\n\n314\n00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:22.980\nthat is fantastic to\nhave that at your ready.\n\n315\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.995\nSo, you being the perfect\nmemorizer of Cisco commands\n\n316\n00:16:26.995 --> 00:16:30.300\ndoesn't necessarily mean the end\nof the world when it comes to\n\n317\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.800\npracticality.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n318\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.750\nAnd the great thing, and\n\n319\n00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.650\nthis is how you learn it, right.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n320\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.720\n&gt;&gt; Is that you make a mistake.\n\n321\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.420\nYou use a question mark.\n\n322\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.370\nAnd then you keep doing it.\n\n323\n00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.080\nAnd all the sudden,\n\n324\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.900\nyou don't use a question mark as much.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n325\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.850\n&gt;&gt; And all the sudden, one day you don't\n\n326\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.360\nuse a question mark at all when\nyou're doing those same commands.\n\n327\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.000\nNow, just like I did there,\nnow I did part of it on purpose, right?\n\n328\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.970\nBut I actually typed it in wrong\nwhen I actually retyped it.\n\n329\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.900\nSo, that's what happened.\n\n330\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.840\nNow, here is where we see this, right?\n\n331\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:01.180\nSo, it is absolutely 100% important that\nwe take a note of that line right there.\n\n332\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:01.690\nOkay?\n\n333\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.670\nThe name for the keys will be exactly that\nidea of that fully qualified domain name.\n\n334\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.610\nSo this is what allows\nit to run through and\n\n335\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.420\ngenerate along with the RSA algorithm,\nor encryption, that we have.\n\n336\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.302\nAnd now you have to choose between\na key modulus range of 360 to 4096,\n\n337\n00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.890\n4-0-9-6 here, okay?\n\n338\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.050\nNow, the default is 512.\n\n339\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.900\nNow, the problem that we\nhave is simple here, okay?\n\n340\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:31.190\nIf we do something like 512,\nwe can run SSH, but it's gonna be the SSH\n\n341\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.010\nversion that's already been cracked.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n342\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n343\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.620\nSo, this will allow you to do that.\n\n344\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.180\nSo, this is like the SSH version 1.\n\n345\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.157\nAnd technically, even that's actually even\nlower, but SSH version 1 will accept it.\n\n346\n00:17:43.157 --> 00:17:47.768\nSo 768, I think, is actually the default,\nthe low end of what SSH wants you to do,\n\n347\n00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:49.895\nbut it will accept, I think, 512.\n\n348\n00:17:49.895 --> 00:17:52.590\nSo what if I wanted it greater than that?\n\n349\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.960\nWell, you can type it in, but remember\nyou need to do those increments, right?\n\n350\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.380\nAgain, this is where\nbinary comes into play.\n\n351\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.605\n512, next would be 124, 248,\n\n352\n00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:07.050\nand then from that point it'd be 4096,\n4-0-9-6.\n\n353\n00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.370\nNow, depending on your switch, okay,\n\n354\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.590\nthis is where you can run\ninto a few issues here, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.770\nIf your switch is an older switch,\nin other words,\n\n356\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.450\nthe CPU is not as powerful\nas you think it is.\n\n357\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.570\nIf you do 4,096, okay, it can be done.\n\n358\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.450\nBut it may take a long time before\nthat particular encryption key is\n\n359\n00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.640\ngenerated, okay?\n\n360\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.950\nSo don't go, okay, I'm done.\n\n361\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.340\nYou're just gonna have to wait until\n\n362\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:30.930\nit's done.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n363\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:31.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n364\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.630\nEven with 2,048 today on today's machine,\nit doesn't take super long.\n\n365\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.110\nBut on a computer that may have\nactually been, or I say computer.\n\n366\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.443\nA switch that may have been manufactured,\nright, in 2008, maybe in 2007,\n\n367\n00:18:44.443 --> 00:18:47.074\nmaybe in 2005, it may take a long time.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n368\n00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just kinda be ready for that.\n\n369\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.868\nBut for us, what's gonna be quick and\nsnappy is going to be where I type\n\n370\n00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:57.644\nin the modulus, which is gonna\nbe a 1,024 bit encryption, okay?\n\n371\n00:18:57.644 --> 00:19:03.309\nNow, we're doing this to help us to\nsave time, but at the same time,\n\n372\n00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:09.970\nthis is the minimal acceptable bit link or\nSSH version 2, which is what we want.\n\n373\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.050\nSo now that I set that up, and\nI tell it, hey, that's what I want here,\n\n374\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.980\nnow notice it says it's generating\n1,024 bit RSA keys here.\n\n375\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.270\nThe keys will be non-exportable.\n\n376\n00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.900\nAnd now, Daniel, that looks weird.\n\n377\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.738\nLook at this thing.\n&gt;&gt; It says 1.99.\n\n378\n00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:31.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't say 2, it says 1.99.\n\n379\n00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:37.980\nWell, when you first look at it,\nyou go, yeah, that's close enough to 2.\n\n380\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.156\nWhat's the big deal?\n&gt;&gt; Eh, we're almost there.\n\n381\n00:19:39.156 --> 00:19:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're almost there.\n\n382\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.110\nThat's closer to 2 than it is to 1, so.\n&gt;&gt; Like government work, right?\n\n383\n00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so yeah, we're right there.\n\n384\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.050\n&gt;&gt; Good enough.\n\n385\n00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:45.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's weird,\n\n386\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.850\nbut what this actually\nmeans is something weird,\n\n387\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.970\nwhich you kinda have to\ndiscover through research.\n\n388\n00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.770\nSSH 1.99 means I'll accept, well,\nSSH version 1 and SSH version 2.\n\n389\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.160\nSo now you're saying, wait a minute.\n\n390\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.640\nDidn't you say that SSH\nversion 1 was cracked?\n\n391\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.220\nWell, yeah, it is cracked.\n\n392\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.390\nBut it's again, yeah,\n\n393\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.670\nas long as it's 1,024 bit, you can use\nSSH version 1, I'll still take it.\n\n394\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.680\nThat's fine with me, I'm okay with it.\n\n395\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.548\nYikes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n396\n00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:15.489\ninsecure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n397\n00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:17.910\nit's not exactly the way\nthat we want it to be.\n\n398\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.280\nSo how do we get to this point?\n\n399\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.180\nLet me hit Enter a couple of times.\n\n400\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.996\nThen the way that we can go ahead and\n\n401\n00:20:24.996 --> 00:20:30.745\ndo this is we can also limit it to\nSSH version 2, but IP SSH version 2.\n\n402\n00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:37.980\nAnd once we do that, that goes ahead and\nit switches it to SSH version 2.\n\n403\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.510\nNow, sometimes it takes\na few moments after you\n\n404\n00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.320\nstart typing in a command or two.\n\n405\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.870\nSometimes you'll actually see where\nit says now SSH version 2 and\n\n406\n00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.560\nyou're ready to go.\n\n407\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.149\nSo it'd say like, Enabled SSH 2.0 or\nsomething like that.\n\n408\n00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:53.449\nAnd that would mean that on this one,\nI was trying to wait but\n\n409\n00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:56.430\nit looks like it's not going\nto do much for us, okay?\n\n410\n00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.730\nAll right, so\nhere's what we have so far, right?\n\n411\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.370\nWe've got everything kind of set\nup the way that we need to, okay?\n\n412\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.020\nWe have an IP address on the device.\n\n413\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.340\nWe've turned it on on that\nvirtual interface, so\n\n414\n00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.370\nwe know it can accept a connection.\n\n415\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.050\nWe now have crypto keys generated.\n\n416\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.580\nEverything is actually good at this point\nand we have the domain name that allowed\n\n417\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.350\nus to generate those unique\ncrypto keys that we needed.\n\n418\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.621\nWe now have SSH version 2, which is fine,\nbut there's a couple of other things that\n\n419\n00:21:24.621 --> 00:21:28.090\nwe need to do here too, and so\nwe'll go ahead and set that up.\n\n420\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:35.000\nIf I wanted to ensure that you made\na remote connection into this switch here\n\n421\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.620\nand was able to use SSH version or SSH,\nthen we have to limit it that way too.\n\n422\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.940\nSo let me get out of this and type in,\nso I typed in the word exit here, or\n\n423\n00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.410\nI think I did.\n\n424\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:52.597\nThere we go.\nAnd now let me do a show running-config\n\n425\n00:21:52.597 --> 00:21:55.750\nhere, and I want to point out a few\ndifferent things as we go along.\n\n426\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.840\nSo, here are of course the physical\ninterfaces that you see.\n\n427\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.290\nAnd down here at the bottom, here is gonna\nbe the IP address that we just typed in\n\n428\n00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.460\nfor that virtual interface as well and\nthe IP address.\n\n429\n00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.930\nAnd now, this is the question that you and\nI have to ask that may be a little bit\n\n430\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.040\nconfusing for people who are just\nstarting here, Daniel, okay?\n\n431\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.560\nI have the physical interface, okay?\n\n432\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.550\nHow do l connect then remotely, what is\nit that asked you allows me to do that?\n\n433\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.539\nWhat allows us to be able to\ndo that is right here, okay,\n\n434\n00:22:31.539 --> 00:22:36.650\nwhere it says line vty and\nthis one says 5-15, okay?\n\n435\n00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.192\nNow, when you see something like this\nhere, okay, VT-wine, VTY, VT-wine.\n\n436\n00:22:43.192 --> 00:22:47.650\nVTY stands for virtual teletype.\n\n437\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.830\nAnd that means it will accept\na remote connection, and\n\n438\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.120\nthis is the actual line\nthat actually accepts that\n\n439\n00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.840\nwhere we can get a remote\nconnection in to do this, okay?\n\n440\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.450\nSo we need to configure VTY to accept\na couple of different things for\n\n441\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.630\nus if we are gonna do this, okay?\n\n442\n00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.124\nSo if I now go into my\nglobal configuration.\n\n443\n00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:17.260\nThen I need to get\ninside of that line vty.\n\n444\n00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.232\nSo how do I do that?\n\n445\n00:23:18.232 --> 00:23:21.744\nI do line vty and\nnow here's something that you\n\n446\n00:23:21.744 --> 00:23:25.805\nwant to know by just kind\nof memorizing this, right?\n\n447\n00:23:25.805 --> 00:23:30.338\nOn a router, you normally have standard,\nat least default,\n\n448\n00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:35.640\nready for accepting connections here,\nfive actual connections.\n\n449\n00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.956\nSo on a router,\nyou'll normally see line vty 0 4.\n\n450\n00:23:39.956 --> 00:23:42.204\nSo you count that and\nthat's what it'll be.\n\n451\n00:23:42.204 --> 00:23:46.050\nOn switches, though, it's usually 16,\n\n452\n00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:50.413\nwhich normally means 0 through 15 here,\nokay?\n\n453\n00:23:50.413 --> 00:23:51.740\nAnd notice it accepted it.\n\n454\n00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.390\nNow, this one was actually only configured\nfor 5 through 15, which is 10, but I want\n\n455\n00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:01.130\nto make sure I get all of the default\nones that are set up at this point, okay?\n\n456\n00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.360\nNow, once I do that, okay,\n\n457\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.730\nI also need to make sure that\nwe can get access in here too.\n\n458\n00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.386\nSo the way that we do this\nis that we also put in, now,\n\n459\n00:24:12.386 --> 00:24:19.680\ntransport input and ssh.\n\n460\n00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.498\nTransport input ssh.\n\n461\n00:24:21.498 --> 00:24:26.623\nThis is essentially limiting us to\njust SSH to make the connection\n\n462\n00:24:26.623 --> 00:24:31.020\nthat we need to and\nthen we are ready at this point to go.\n\n463\n00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.130\nNow, there's a couple of other\nthings that I'm leaving off\n\n464\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.700\nright now because we want to verify this.\n\n465\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.660\nAnd I wanna show you there\nare some things that end up\n\n466\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.240\nhappening here that you\nmay not think about.\n\n467\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.330\nAnd then we'll go back and\nwe'll correct them to help us out as well.\n\n468\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.830\nBut at this point, this switch should be\nready for us to be able to make a remote\n\n469\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:55.910\nconnection in and then of course\nverify that we are ready to go.\n\n470\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.400\nUnless we're doing that, then we'll be\nready to go into our router configuration.\n\n471\n00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.650\nBut Daniel, at this point,\n\n472\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.161\nit looks like that I have run\nus out of time at the end here.\n\n473\n00:25:03.161 --> 00:25:06.523\nBut this is an important concept cuz it's\none of the very things that you'll do on\n\n474\n00:25:06.523 --> 00:25:08.860\njust about every switch\nthat you come across.\n\n475\n00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.530\nSo make sure you get this concept down.\n&gt;&gt; Well, not a problem Ronnie.\n\n476\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.600\nYou know, we are more than\naccommodating when it comes to\n\n477\n00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.150\nmultiple parts on the show.\n\n478\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.360\nWe're more than happy to give you that,\nwell, that thing to do.\n\n479\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.600\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today and\nwe thank you good folks for watching.\n\n480\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.100\nBut we are out of time for\nthis episode so we're signing off.\n\n481\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.680\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n482\n00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n483\n00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.400\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next

00:00:07.687\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:10.144\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:11.943\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:12.461\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n7\n00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:15.731\ngreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITPro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:18.501\nI'm you're host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:22.062\nwe continue on with more in our CCENT\nseries specifically we're looking at\n\n10\n00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:24.792\ninitial device configuration\ninto a part three of that.\n\n11\n00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:28.465\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\nagain our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.709\nRonnie, welcome back man who's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It's going good Daniel as we\n\n13\n00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.910\ncontinue on taking a look\nat our lab setting here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.020\nWe have just finished\nthe configuration on the switch\n\n15\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.090\nto make sure that we\ncould do remote access.\n\n16\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.970\nAnd now we're ready to test, and\nwe're gonna find a few issues here.\n\n17\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.340\nBut overall, though,\nwe should be able to make a connection.\n\n18\n00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.180\nSo we haven't done everything fully yet.\n\n19\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.150\nBut at least at this point,\nwe should be able to make a connection.\n\n20\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.650\nRemember that we have an IP address on\nthe switch, we have also went ahead and\n\n21\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.500\nset up the cryptokeys along with\nthe host name and domain name.\n\n22\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.770\nAnd then, once we did that,\n\n23\n00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.730\nwe also set up the VTY lines\nto be able to accept SSH only.\n\n24\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.550\nSo we don't want to build\na telnet into this thing.\n\n25\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.260\nOnce everything is actually done like\nthat then we're just about ready to go.\n\n26\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.790\nSo now that we're on, I'm gone ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.860\nswitched over to the windows\nlab machine as well.\n\n28\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.130\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n29\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.100\nSo there is also a lab machine\nis called P lab SCO 01.\n\n30\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.820\nHere, lab csc01 what that might stand for\nlabs demo.\n\n31\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.122\nWhatever that is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.569\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's just a lab machine that\n\n33\n00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.660\nthey will attach that\nwe can do verification.\n\n34\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.540\nOkay that's what they've done for us.\n\n35\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.260\nSo one of the things that I want to make\nsure that I have if I'm gonna be doing\n\n36\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.490\nremote connections so this is like us.\n\n37\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.290\nWe've got everything set up and\nconfigured the way we want to.\n\n38\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.670\nWe now slide into the rack,\nwherever our networking clause is.\n\n39\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.640\nWe plug a network cable into it.\n\n40\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.030\nWe hopefully have also given it an IP\naddress on the network that we are on.\n\n41\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.230\nAnd now I am back at my desk using\nthis I think Windows 8 machine is\n\n42\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.200\nwhat this one actually is set up to be.\n\n43\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.130\nSo once everything is\nactually done here okay.\n\n44\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.290\nI am bringing up my command prompt and\nI am simply going to ping that switch.\n\n45\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.180\nOr at least I think I am\ngoing to ping that switch.\n\n46\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.310\nAnd there we go okay?\n\n47\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.820\nSo I am getting now pings coming back\nwhich means I have connectivity.\n\n48\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.580\nThat's the first thing to establish\nin route to connection of course\n\n49\n00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.750\nis just plain connectivity.\n\n50\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.140\nBut after that point we now need\nto of course establish SSH.\n\n51\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.960\nProbably the easiest way on\na Windows machine to establish SSH.\n\n52\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.470\nIs to actually download a utility out\nthere that's been free for as long as I've\n\n53\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.550\nknown, called PuTTY,\nP-U-T-T-Y configurations.\n\n54\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.910\nSo if you go out and\nyou do a search for it on Heck,\n\n55\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.290\njust about any search engine,\nit's usually the first, I mean,\n\n56\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.380\nsmack dab the first one.\n&gt;&gt; You don't even have to\n\n57\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.190\ninstall anything.\n\n58\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.500\nI mean, just run it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n59\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.490\nall of this is actually just run in RAM.\n\n60\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.160\nYou can.\n\n61\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.120\nThey have a Windows installer and\nI think this is actually what this one is.\n\n62\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.570\nIt's actually a Windows installer, but if\nyou want to bring this along on a USB key,\n\n63\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.050\nyou don't have to install anything.\n\n64\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.110\nYou can run it directly from that key and\nthen it will also end up working for you.\n\n65\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.660\nYou'll see, let me see if I\ncan zoom in here just briefly.\n\n66\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.400\nSometimes I have to zoom,\nsometimes I don't.\n\n67\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.760\nI can't do that right now,\nso let's do it this way.\n\n68\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.940\nThere's some different commands here,\nthere's TELNET, there's R LOG IN,\n\n69\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.190\nthere's SSH.\n\n70\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.210\nSo, if I wanted to run telnet,\nI would just switch the dot to here.\n\n71\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.910\nBut we are gonna run SSH.\n\n72\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.940\nAnd all that's doing is flipping\nthe port number from one to the other.\n\n73\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.260\nSo, for us, we're gonna use SSH,\nand it's gonna be on port 22.\n\n74\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.710\nThen I simply type in the IP address right\nhere of what I gave that switch, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.270\nSo once I've selected that\nI can now click open.\n\n76\n00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.280\nAnd now it's gonna ask me and\nsay hey, are you sure?\n\n77\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.430\nYou're actually now getting a new\ncertificate and I can't validate this\n\n78\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.590\ncertificate and that's because it\nwas generated on the switch itself.\n\n79\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.790\nSo it's saying, well, are you sure\nyou want to make this connection?\n\n80\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.730\nWell, yes.\n\n81\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.080\nYes, I am sure.\n\n82\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.820\nSo I'll select yes here and now here's\nwhere we're going to run into an issue.\n\n83\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.670\nLet me see if I can change this just so\nthat we can see here.\n\n84\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.210\nI'll forget that in Putty.\n\n85\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.170\nHere it is, Change Settings.\n\n86\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.130\nSo then I have to go to Appearance.\n\n87\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.990\nAnd now to change this font here.\n\n88\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.850\nAll these things just so\nthat we can see a little bit more.\n\n89\n00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:35.609\nThere we go.\n\n90\n00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.490\nOf course, there's also dark as crazy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n92\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.490\nHopefully you can see that.\n\n93\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.714\nIf not, let me do one more setting change\nhere, and I'll just change the font color.\n\n94\n00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:45.219\nRight here.\n\n95\n00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.730\nDefault foreground, modify this.\n\n96\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.270\nWe'll change it to a bright\nwhite instead of grey.\n\n97\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.610\nDefaulted to gray at one time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n98\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.980\n&gt;&gt; It didn't make any sense to me, but\n\n99\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.210\nI guess that's just the way it was, okay?\n\n100\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.800\nAll right, so Daniel, it's actually\nsaying that I need to log in.\n\n101\n00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.890\nSo it's communicating with the other side.\n\n102\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.750\nBut the problem is I didn't remember\nsetting anybody that I should login as.\n\n103\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.130\nSo I setup a password\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n\n104\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.970\n&gt;&gt; An enable password.\n\n105\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.550\nI setup the idea of doing that and enable\nsecret but I didn't setup an actual user\n\n106\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.830\naccount to login here so now it's saying\nlook you haven't actually done anything.\n\n107\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.560\nSo instead what the security feature says,\n\n108\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.720\nyou've timed out because you have\nnot actually done any of this.\n\n109\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.510\nIt lets you know that we\nare getting the connection, but\n\n110\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.410\nthe initial thing that we wanted to\nsee at this point, Daniel, though,\n\n111\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.340\nwas that once we made that connection,\nit said here's the encryption key.\n\n112\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.970\nIf you want to make this a secured\nconnection, you accept it.\n\n113\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.800\nPutty actually allowed us to do that,\nand to accept it.\n\n114\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.290\nAnd now we can see initially at this point\n\n115\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.850\nthat the idea of actually being\nable to do this is possible okay.\n\n116\n00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.410\nNow you might be wondering\nare we going to do that?\n\n117\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.380\nWe are going to set up using it.\n\n118\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.380\nWe are not going to do it right now.\n\n119\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.630\nAs we go on and we start setting up some\nsecurity after we get into the router and\n\n120\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.270\nthe switch configuration a little\nbit further because this is just\n\n121\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.410\nthe initial part.\n\n122\n00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.360\nWe will go in and also set up user name\nand password so that this can happen.\n\n123\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.990\nBut at least at the beginning,\n\n124\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.810\nthat is what you're actually seeing\nhere is that it can be done, so\n\n125\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.130\nin theory, what should happen at this\npoint is you go and set up a user name and\n\n126\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.490\npassword, and then from that point, you\ncan configure the router or the switch.\n\n127\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.330\nAnd the great thing that's a configuration\nthat we're showing here, Dan or\n\n128\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.190\nsomething like remote access, and even\nthe initial configurations that we set up\n\n129\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.770\nare almost identical to what we\nnormally would run inside of a router.\n\n130\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.150\nSo that is what we want to take\na look at next as we begin.\n\n131\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.050\nSo that's kind of the thing and you'll\nprobably see that we will set this up\n\n132\n00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.070\na couple of times throughout the entire\nseries here as we go on through\n\n133\n00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.850\nthe rest of our configuration and\nworking with routers and switches, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.580\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look, then, at a router.\n\n135\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.510\nSo the router that I've chosen and\nselected from our practice labs here,\n\n136\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.460\nis going to be, well, one called ny edge.\n\n137\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.910\nAnd that's the way we'll\nhopefully be able to see that.\n\n138\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.290\nThat looks okay.\n\n139\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.150\nI think that looks pretty good.\n\n140\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.910\nFor us, same things that we would\nhave normally seen inside of the boot\n\n141\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.900\nprocess for a switch.\n\n142\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.790\nWe also follow that same process for\nthe router as well, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.840\nAt the beginning, if there is no startup\nconfig, there is no startup config, and\n\n144\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.050\nit will lead you to this once it\nreboots or once it starts again.\n\n145\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.500\nOkay so, if you turn it on by turning\non the switch it will go through and\n\n146\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.640\nshow you all the same information.\n\n147\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.380\nYou'll be able to spot different things,\nsuch as the iOS version and, of course,\n\n148\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.070\nthe hardware setup that's on that\nparticular device at this point, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.770\nNow, because it didn't find the startup\nconfig, Daniel, this is where it gives us,\n\n150\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.160\nwhich is to this point Do I want to do\nthe initial configuration down lock?\n\n151\n00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.025\nIf anything else, this is a key for\nus at least visually right?\n\n152\n00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:57.197\nThat I know that there is no start up\nconfig being shown on this router, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:57.197 --> 00:07:58.382\nNow, there's two possibilities here.\n\n154\n00:07:58.382 --> 00:08:01.269\nEither nobody's actually ever touched\nthis router yet to set anything up.\n\n155\n00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:07.350\nSo, Factory default or you've actually\nchanged it so it wouldn't do that.\n\n156\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.900\nAnd that is something that\nwe will do when we start to\n\n157\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.150\nkind of do the management side or\nrouters and configurations,\n\n158\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.760\nwhere we say we're gonna change the\nconfiguration register because, Daniel,\n\n159\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.300\nI've forgotten the password, okay.?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n160\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.330\n&gt;&gt; And if I do something like that,\n\n161\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.110\nI have to change that configuration\nregister that gets me into\n\n162\n00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.740\npassword reset mode,\nwhich says load up the startup config, but\n\n163\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.100\ndon't load up what's in the,\nor don't load up.\n\n164\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.506\nExcuse me,\ndon't load up the startup config,\n\n165\n00:08:31.506 --> 00:08:33.383\njust load up normally without that.\n\n166\n00:08:33.383 --> 00:08:37.483\nAnd then, what we can do is we can then\ncopy the startup config into the RAM.\n\n167\n00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:39.921\nAnd then from that point,\nyou can change the actual password and\n\n168\n00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:41.510\nthen you have to go back and change that.\n\n169\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.760\nBut at this point,\nthat's kinda the initial thing.\n\n170\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.775\nAnd I'm standing on this,\nDaniel, for a reason.\n\n171\n00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:49.988\nCuz a lot of times what you'll get\nthis is you start facing the exam\n\n172\n00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.043\nquestions are just simple screenshots.\n\n173\n00:08:52.043 --> 00:08:55.946\nThey wanna know if you actually have been\nin the router itself or on the switch and\n\n174\n00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:59.556\nwhat you're able to see so make sure so\nmake sure you go through this type of\n\n175\n00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:03.365\nconfiguration and this dialog to be sure\nthat you see what you need to, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:06.700\nSo that boot process is\ngonna be the same thing.\n\n177\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.307\nNow for us since we're not\ngonna walk through that,\n\n178\n00:09:09.307 --> 00:09:12.030\nI'm simply gonna type in no at this point.\n\n179\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.560\nDo take some time if you\nhave some time on your own\n\n180\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.930\nto walk through that\ninitial configuration.\n\n181\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.280\nYou'll see it does a pretty good\nset up for you, but it is slow.\n\n182\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.810\nAnd you have to actually answer\nwhat they want you to answer.\n\n183\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.010\nAnd so you'll get through that, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.690\nSo once we actually decided no,\nnow notice that everything is now getting\n\n185\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.645\nlisted out here about the interfaces and\nsome of the different things.\n\n186\n00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:39.010\nYou're getting links date changes as well,\nline protocol changes, too.\n\n187\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.450\nNotice crypto is also enabled here.\n\n188\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.020\nSo there's a lot of information that is\nnow starting to come across the screen\n\n189\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.980\nthat we're seeing as the router\nis getting prepared to do\n\n190\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.080\nwhat we need it to do here, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.160\nSo that's kinda the initial.\n\n192\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.900\nSo let's kind of see a couple of things\nand point them out as we go along.\n\n193\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.507\nSo Daniel, one of the most confusing\nthings at the beginning, right,\n\n194\n00:10:01.507 --> 00:10:03.469\ninitially is when you start\nseeing all of this stuff.\n\n195\n00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:06.521\nYou'll normally see some of\nthe different ones that we wanna pay\n\n196\n00:10:06.521 --> 00:10:08.056\nattention to like this, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:11.500\n%LINK-3-UPDOWN, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.450\nSomething like this actually does tell you\nthat hey, this has to do with the link and\n\n199\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.860\nthis is a level 3 in the syslog\nmessaging and what you wanna do,\n\n200\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.960\nand it's an updown type of message.\n\n201\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.590\nOn this one,\n\n202\n00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.300\nthis is very specific here, notice it\ntells me about the interface right away.\n\n203\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.360\nAnd you can see that it lets you know\nthat something happened here, right?\n\n204\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.120\nOn gigabit interface 0 slash 0\nthe state was changed to down.\n\n205\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.730\nIt doesn't mean that it was\nactually down at the beginning.\n\n206\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.490\nIt says I changed to down.\n\n207\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.450\nSo that means administratively or it was\nconfigured that way change to DOWN and\n\n208\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:51.450\nthen notice that one and\ntwo though were actually changed to UP.\n\n209\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.234\nSo it's an active verb, right?\n\n210\n00:10:53.234 --> 00:10:54.320\nIt says it was changed.\n\n211\n00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.910\nIt doesn't say it's up.\n\n212\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.360\nIt doesn't say it's down.\n\n213\n00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.849\nIt actually says it was\nchanged to that state and\n\n214\n00:10:59.849 --> 00:11:02.722\nyou want to make sure you pay\nattention to that as well.\n\n215\n00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:07.445\nThe other thing that you'll see is that\nthere's a difference between this, this\n\n216\n00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:12.420\nsays link up down and then notice a little\nbit further down here, Daniel, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.140\nIt says line protocol up down, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.520\nNow this is the easiest way I\nknow to help somebody to remember\n\n219\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.490\nthe differences here, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.869\nWhen you take a look at\na regular NIC on a computer,\n\n221\n00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:27.209\nremember there's two lights normally,\nokay?\n\n222\n00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:30.760\nThe older ones had three lights, but\nusually today, you'll see two lights.\n\n223\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.570\nOne is for power, right?\n\n224\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.390\nThat's the link that says,\nhey, you plug it in.\n\n225\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.170\n&gt;&gt; I sense something.\n\n226\n00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.480\n&gt;&gt; I sense something is on the other\n\n227\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.730\nside, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.860\nThat is equivalent to what you see\nright here that says LINK, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.585\nThat means hey, I'm getting\nsomething on the other side, or\n\n230\n00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:48.590\nI'm not getting something\non the other side.\n\n231\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.500\nSo if you actually see something like\nthat, that's what you're seeing there.\n\n232\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.040\nLine protocol is the blinking light,\nokay, which indicates activity.\n\n233\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.731\nI'm getting protocol\nactivity going across here.\n\n234\n00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:05.560\nSo if you see that on a regular Nic and\nyou go, light is on.\n\n235\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.240\nThen you know what?\n\n236\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.085\nThe link is up,\n\n237\n00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:11.724\nokay, and as you see the other side which\nis blinking of a light, that means what?\n\n238\n00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:15.240\nI'm receiving traffic, okay, or\nI'm sending traffic, whatever way it is.\n\n239\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.150\nSo pay attention to that because\nyou'll always see these things will be\n\n240\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:24.020\nlifted something a little bit\nstrangely like line is up, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.490\nProtocol is down, something like that.\n\n242\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.590\nWell, then now hopefully\nyou'll have in your mind here\n\n243\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.910\nthat picture of that blinking light.\n\n244\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.520\nI see line protocol down, well,\nusually the other possibility, right,\n\n245\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.980\nis that the link could be up but\nI'm not sending or receiving anything.\n\n246\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.230\nSo hopefully you won't actually\nsee this where the link is down.\n\n247\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.610\nBut the protocol is still\nworking cuz that'd be silly.\n\n248\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.542\nI'm not saying,\n\n249\n00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:48.300\nno I am saying it can't happen.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.255\n&gt;&gt; So just make sure that you pay\n\n251\n00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:54.087\nattention to stuff like that\nas we go on through as well.\n\n252\n00:12:54.087 --> 00:12:57.550\nAll right, let me go and\npress Enter a few times here.\n\n253\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.743\nNotice it delves me back out at the same\ncommand prompt that we would have before.\n\n254\n00:13:01.743 --> 00:13:06.738\nSo we'll just do some basic configuration\njust like we did on the actual router\n\n255\n00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:08.270\nat this point.\n\n256\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.670\nSo once we did that, I used enable.\n\n257\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:18.080\nAnd now I am going to set this up for,\nConfiguration terminal.\n\n258\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.270\nSo from the privilege exec mode, so\n\n259\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.900\nyou'll see these are the same commands\nwe learned about inside of the switch.\n\n260\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.140\nNot configuration.\n\n261\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.240\nSo it should be configure, see, terminal.\n\n262\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.676\nThat brings me into the global\nconfiguration mode.\n\n263\n00:13:32.676 --> 00:13:38.505\nFrom this point, one of the first things\nthat I suggest that you do is go ahead and\n\n264\n00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:40.480\nset up a hostname.\n\n265\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.320\nSo type in hostname and\nthen I'm just gonna use router,\n\n266\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.080\nactually I should do NY [LAUGH]\nShould follow the lab guide?\n\n267\n00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.110\nNYEDGE1 is what we should end up doing,\nokay.\n\n268\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.188\nSo now we are on NYEDGE1.\n\n269\n00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:57.640\nThat's one of the first things that\nwe should also be able to do here.\n\n270\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.960\nThe other thing is I want to set up, of\ncourse, that distinction between user mode\n\n271\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.260\nand privileged EXEC mode so\nthat you need a password to get in.\n\n272\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.441\nBut I want it to be secure by default.\n\n273\n00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:14.390\nI'm going to do ENABLE SECRET and\nwe're just gonna do CISCO1 at this point.\n\n274\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.520\nRemember that you should think about\nmaking these passwords on your\n\n275\n00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.080\nreal production equipment something\na bit more complex than this.\n\n276\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.686\nBut overall though on a lab,\nit just makes it easy for me, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:26.686 --> 00:14:31.159\nAll right, so once we've got that, okay,\nlet's take a look at some of the hardware\n\n278\n00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:35.130\nthat's on this, especially on the\ninterfaces cuz now this should tie back\n\n279\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.540\ninto when we talked about interacting\nwith Cisco devices a little bit.\n\n280\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:46.100\nSo from here, I'm gonna exit out of\nthe global configuration mode and\n\n281\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.892\ntype in showIP Interface brief, okay?\n\n282\n00:14:49.892 --> 00:14:53.530\nWhen I do this, now you're gonna\nsee just a couple of other things.\n\n283\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.300\nAnd let me zoom in here\njust a little bit more so\n\n284\n00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.662\nthat we can see it a little\nbit better here, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:04.440\nAll right, Daniel, if you kind of\nremember back when we did this show on\n\n286\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.500\ninteracting with the actual Cisco devices,\nI talked about that on the router\n\n287\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.810\nthat we showed you that it had network\nmodules and HWIDs and stuff like that too.\n\n288\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.850\nWe talked about this numbering\nsystem that you see.\n\n289\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.730\nSo remember that when you see\nthis idea of the device itself.\n\n290\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.280\nUsually of course on the chassis that's\ngonna be a zero is what you're gonna end\n\n291\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.050\nup seeing there and\nthen this is the port on that device.\n\n292\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.170\nSo for this router, we haven't found out\nany other information like the model or\n\n293\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.010\nthe chassis.\n\n294\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.950\nWe're gonna get that\na little bit later here.\n\n295\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.350\nBut at this point here, you can see\nthat this one has three interfaces.\n\n296\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.010\nThe big kind of distinction,\n\n297\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.450\nat least physically that you\nshould be able to see, right?\n\n298\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.600\nOn a router you won't see a ton of ports,\n\n299\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.594\nwhereas on switches you'd generally\nsee that there is more port density.\n\n300\n00:15:51.594 --> 00:15:54.492\nSo if you see one and\nall of the front plate is ports,\n\n301\n00:15:54.492 --> 00:15:57.739\nyou can kinda make a good assumption,\nthat's a switch.\n\n302\n00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:02.223\nOr you see 12 or 24 of them,\nor 16 or 48 of them,\n\n303\n00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:05.934\nthey're probably gonna be a switch, okay.\n\n304\n00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:09.636\nIf you go and you see this massive\ndevice and there's like three ports, or\n\n305\n00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:13.222\ntwo ports, on it, it's probably a router.\n&gt;&gt; It's not my 48-port router?\n\n306\n00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.576\nYeah, it's not a 48.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:16.431\n&gt;&gt; That would be interesting.\n\n308\n00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:17.600\n&gt;&gt; It's quite unlikely.\n\n309\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.870\n&gt;&gt; It's quite unlikely,\n\n310\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.030\nI'm not saying it can't.\n\n311\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.911\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n312\n00:16:20.911 --> 00:16:24.025\nhe's gonna put his money on the table.\n&gt;&gt; I'll go ahead and It'll be a few,\n\n313\n00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.280\ndon't get me wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Spin that wheel.\n\n314\n00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.745\n&gt;&gt; You can do that but here and\n\n315\n00:16:27.745 --> 00:16:30.415\nnow, look at this, Daniel, here it is.\n\n316\n00:16:30.415 --> 00:16:36.170\nLook, 0/0 then /0 here, okay.\n\n317\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.120\nSo now, we understand that on this one,\n\n318\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.750\nit's not that it's not on the device,\nokay.\n\n319\n00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.260\nBut this is on the first kind of h whick,\nokay?\n\n320\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.180\nSo when you see this first zero here,\nokay, that's actually on the device.\n\n321\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:54.015\nBut that card is an h whick which\nis where we see that first one.\n\n322\n00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:57.790\nAnd now,\nit's the first port on that card, okay?\n\n323\n00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.167\nSo that's why we get that weird numbering\nsystem that can go on too, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:06.331\nAnd then the same thing, on the device,\nthat very first h whick,\n\n325\n00:17:06.331 --> 00:17:11.930\nthis is the second port on that device is\nalso what you'll end up seeing as well.\n\n326\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.200\nSo then of course if you see a 1/0/0,\nyou will know that that means\n\n327\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.610\nthat's the second car or something like\nthe second device or the second module.\n\n328\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.840\nAnd usually,\nthat module one network module one,\n\n329\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.460\nand then you will be able to go ahead and\nfind that as well.\n\n330\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.620\nSo just some brief\ninformation that we can see.\n\n331\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.530\nLet's spend a little bit of\ntime on the serial ports.\n\n332\n00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.670\nCuz even though they're not really used\nthat much anymore in real production,\n\n333\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.700\nas far as I know, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.680\nBut they are caught on exam, cuz there's\nsome interesting information here\n\n335\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.240\nthat you've gotta know about in terms\nof serial ports, as well, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.280\nSo let's do a show, oops,\nbut I can type it up.\n\n337\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.357\nShow controllers, and\nthen I'm simply going to type in\n\n338\n00:17:54.357 --> 00:17:59.657\nthe name of that interface,\nwhich is serial0/0/0.\n\n339\n00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:01.900\nNow, Daniel,\nnotice I didn't type it in in capital?\n\n340\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.447\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n341\n00:18:02.447 --> 00:18:03.515\n&gt;&gt; So, it doesn't have to match\n\n342\n00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:04.347\nthe case.\n&gt;&gt; It's not case sensitive.\n\n343\n00:18:04.347 --> 00:18:05.671\n&gt;&gt; So, it's not case sensitive,\n\n344\n00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:06.690\nit should be fine.\n\n345\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.160\nThe key though is making sure that\nyou get enough of these words up\n\n346\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.650\nhere abbreviated or unabbreviated at this\npoint, so it recognizes it as a command.\n\n347\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.430\nNow, as I do this, what we're paying\nattention to is right here, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.020\nSo right after that,\n\n349\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.310\nnotice I am showing the interface 0/0/0\nwhich is the one that I typed in.\n\n350\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:34.220\nShows me the hardware, but what I wanna\npay attention to is right here, okay.\n\n351\n00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.830\nThis line right here is very important.\n\n352\n00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.305\nIt really does let you know\nsomething about serial ports and\n\n353\n00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:40.700\nthey're a connection, right?\n\n354\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.633\nSo when you have a serial connection, one\nside essentially becomes the master, okay.\n\n355\n00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:48.414\nThe other side,\nyou can call it slave if you want to.\n\n356\n00:18:48.414 --> 00:18:51.627\nBut the key is that there is an upstream,\nthere's a downstream device, okay.\n\n357\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.567\nFor us in this type of cable\non serial cables this one\n\n358\n00:18:56.567 --> 00:19:00.764\nis connected to a V.35 cable\nwhich is a massive chunk.\n\n359\n00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:04.111\nIt's a massive block of\na serial connector, okay.\n\n360\n00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:07.597\nAnd you can remove pins, and put different\npins in to get the configuration\n\n361\n00:19:07.597 --> 00:19:09.700\nyou want to that you want, okay?\n\n362\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.170\nNow, that's not the important thing, but\n\n363\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:16.030\nit is this term DTE here that matters,\nokay?\n\n364\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.910\nDTE means it doesn't set\nits own clock speed, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.610\nIt means it receives a clock speed,\n\n366\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.560\nin other words it is the downstream\ndevice from the other side.\n\n367\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.250\nSo on this interface,\n\n368\n00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.860\nif you're to configure this interface, you\ndo not necessarily have to set the clock.\n\n369\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.700\nDoes it matter if you do?\n\n370\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.640\nNot really, but overall though, you\ndon't have to set the clock on this sub.\n\n371\n00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.250\nIf I go to Edge 2,\nlet's see if I can get to Edge 2 here and\n\n372\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.420\non this device,\nsee if I can get access in here.\n\n373\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.770\nSo let's say, no.\n\n374\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.230\nWe're not gonna enter\nthe initial configuration.\n\n375\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.690\nAt least I thought we would get there.\n\n376\n00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.810\nLooks like it's locked up on us,\nthere we go, okay.\n\n377\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.247\nSo now, it's starting to report in.\n\n378\n00:20:02.247 --> 00:20:06.223\nI'm simply going to type ENABLE,\n\n379\n00:20:06.223 --> 00:20:11.991\nthen I'm gonna do\nSHOW CONTROLLER controllers.\n\n380\n00:20:11.991 --> 00:20:14.974\nS, I'm gonna abbreviate here just quickly,\nso\n\n381\n00:20:14.974 --> 00:20:18.120\nthat you can see some of\nthe abbreviations as well.\n\n382\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.685\nSo now, I'm gonna change this around.\n\n383\n00:20:22.685 --> 00:20:26.806\nI know through the diagram\nthat's also listed in the lab\n\n384\n00:20:26.806 --> 00:20:30.410\nguide that you'll have for\nPractice labs here.\n\n385\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.330\nLet me see if I can find\nwhere I typed that in, okay?\n\n386\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.140\nSo here is the command.\n\n387\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.720\nNow, this is something else that kinda\nfreaks people out at the beginning,\n\n388\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.810\nDaniel, right?\n\n389\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.320\nEven as information is\nscrolling by on the screen.\n\n390\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.220\nAs long as you have\nthe command prompt down there,\n\n391\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.080\nDaniel, you can start typing in commands.\n\n392\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.170\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n393\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.770\nSo, notice it looks a little bit offset,\n\n394\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.580\nit looks weird because it's\nstuck way out here, okay?\n\n395\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.550\nBut now, it starts reporting,\nand this time, Daniel,\n\n396\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.800\nnotice the difference right here, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.210\nNotice this one says DCE instead of DTE.\n\n398\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.061\nSo this is the data channel equipment or\ndata whatever.\n\n399\n00:21:05.061 --> 00:21:07.690\nI think there was another term,\nbut I can't write it.\n\n400\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.176\nI always called it data channel equipment,\nand that means the upstream device.\n\n401\n00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:11.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n402\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.616\n&gt;&gt; And you can see where it\n\n403\n00:21:12.616 --> 00:21:13.391\nsays clock rate.\n\n404\n00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:17.946\nWhereas, if I went back to NYEDGE1,\nthis is DTE, and\n\n405\n00:21:17.946 --> 00:21:24.280\nnotice that the clock is not set there,\nbut it is only being detected.\n\n406\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.720\nReceived is what we're also seeing here.\n\n407\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.534\nI was doing that, and it's even got a\npercentage like how far it could be on or\n\n408\n00:21:31.534 --> 00:21:33.203\noff at some point, okay.\n\n409\n00:21:33.203 --> 00:21:36.768\nSo these particular types of controllers\nhere, allow us to be able to\n\n410\n00:21:36.768 --> 00:21:40.763\nsee which side is actually kind of\nthe upstream device with the clocking, and\n\n411\n00:21:40.763 --> 00:21:42.480\nthen the downstream.\n\n412\n00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.280\nAnd yes, even today, in 2018,\n\n413\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.370\nas of the recording of this show,\nyou might go, I'll never see this.\n\n414\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.050\nIf you're gonna see it in any place,\nany place at all,\n\n415\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.090\nit's gonna be on Cisco exam, okay?\n\n416\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.010\nAnd I hate to say that.\n\n417\n00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.734\nThey just want to know if you understand\nthe idea of serial interfaces.\n\n418\n00:21:59.734 --> 00:22:03.492\nEven if they're not you, that is\njust a part of what their legacy is.\n\n419\n00:22:03.492 --> 00:22:07.192\nSo they want you understand that, so\nmake sure you know how to do that,\n\n420\n00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:11.713\nrun that command, show control it and then\ninterphase number to determine whether or\n\n421\n00:22:11.713 --> 00:22:15.915\nnot you know which one is actually the\ndevice, so is clocking, it is still one of\n\n422\n00:22:15.915 --> 00:22:18.343\nthose questions that you may get.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n423\n00:22:18.343 --> 00:22:22.158\nwas it frame relay that this was\nseen in primarily back in the day?\n\n424\n00:22:22.158 --> 00:22:25.146\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, frame relay, T1, yeah.\n\n425\n00:22:25.146 --> 00:22:29.086\nBut frame relay, it was very important to\nknow frame relay to be able to do that.\n\n426\n00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:32.440\nSo just kind of realize that,\nyeah, frame relay is not\n\n427\n00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.690\nsomething that we see anymore, but\nit used to be like, every single lab.\n\n428\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.624\nWell, every lab in Cisco was built\noff of essentially frame relay, okay,\n\n429\n00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:40.445\nat some point.\n\n430\n00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:43.600\nBut today like connect\nan Ethernet we're fine.\n\n431\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:50.419\n[CROSSTALK] So that technology, it's not\nthat it's not good technology in LAN.\n\n432\n00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:53.917\nIt really does help you to understand\na lot more, but overall though,\n\n433\n00:22:53.917 --> 00:22:55.650\njust make sure you pay attention.\n\n434\n00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.410\nI wouldn't have thrown in\n\n435\n00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.430\nthere if I didn't think it was\nactually that important, okay?\n\n436\n00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.220\nSo now, let's go ahead and\ndo a couple of other commands here too.\n\n437\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.630\nNow, back at NYEDGE1,\nwhich is the top one here.\n\n438\n00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.307\nLet me scroll and get that just\nfully on the screen for us so that.\n\n439\n00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.709\nWait, online to you?\n\n440\n00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.420\nAnd that's right.\n\n441\n00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.720\nOkay, actually I kept\nseeing the word router and\n\n442\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.910\nI forgot I had actually issued\nthe host name, that's me.\n\n443\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.790\nI was like,\nwhy is it not showing up right here?\n\n444\n00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.961\nLet me get through all that\nstuff on that controller here.\n\n445\n00:23:31.441 --> 00:23:33.810\n'Cuz there's a lot of information\ncoming from that controller.\n\n446\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.940\nTrying to get through\nall the end of it here.\n\n447\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.290\nWell, maybe, there we go, finally.\n\n448\n00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.930\nSo I hope no wonder\nthe buffer size is huge here.\n\n449\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.500\nSo now, at the end, let's do this.\n\n450\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.666\nLet's do the Show IP protocols, well.\n\n451\n00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:51.567\nNow, when we take a look at\nthis idea of show IP protocols,\n\n452\n00:23:51.567 --> 00:23:54.727\nthis is actually saying, hey,\nwhat is this one about, okay?\n\n453\n00:23:54.727 --> 00:24:03.079\nSo this NFS aware allows us to continue\nforward routes Even if a reboot happens.\n\n454\n00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:05.180\nIt's kind of weird, okay?\n\n455\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.680\nIt essentially allows us\nto kind of not worry.\n\n456\n00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.160\nSo if for one reason the operating\nsystem gets reset and\n\n457\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.670\nyou're still in the middle,\nit may drop a packet or two.\n\n458\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.690\nBut IP routing and NSF, and I'm trying\nto remember what it stands for now, but\n\n459\n00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:24.390\nit's supposed to allow you to continue to\nforward routing traffic if you need to,\n\n460\n00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.060\nwhile a reboot happens.\n\n461\n00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.790\nSo you may drop maybe one packet or\ntwo, but\n\n462\n00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.100\nit does a great job at maintaining that.\n\n463\n00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.590\nSo at this point,\nthere's no actual IP routing protocols\n\n464\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.150\nthat are actually showing up here too,\nokay?\n\n465\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.860\nThe other thing that we want to\ndo here is do a show version.\n\n466\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.373\nWhen I wrote run this show version,\n\n467\n00:24:45.373 --> 00:24:50.195\nnotice it tells me exactly what\ntype of software that I have.\n\n468\n00:24:50.195 --> 00:24:56.285\nAnd here of course is the iOS name,\nwhich is 2900-UNIVERSALK9.\n\n469\n00:24:56.285 --> 00:25:00.369\nNow, this brings us to a good important\npoint that I do need to make as\n\n470\n00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:01.239\nwell, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:01.239 --> 00:25:05.110\nDaniel, this K9 right here\nis very important, okay?\n\n472\n00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:09.225\nSome iOSs that you'll end up\nseeing that are on these devices,\n\n473\n00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:13.340\nis they give you the name, like universal,\nbut they don't have the K9 at the end.\n\n474\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.240\nHere's the big thing for\nmost of us at the beginning.\n\n475\n00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.752\nThe remote access that you and\nI set up using SSH, it won't be there.\n\n476\n00:25:22.752 --> 00:25:23.264\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:25:23.264 --> 00:25:24.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just won't be\n\n478\n00:25:24.714 --> 00:25:25.380\nable to have it.\n\n479\n00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:31.540\nSo if you see this and somebody says,\nI can't run the crypto key generate RSA,\n\n480\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:36.180\ndo a Show Version, verify\nthe version of the software here and\n\n481\n00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.580\nyou can even see like the file itself.\n\n482\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.320\nThe file name itself is down here.\n\n483\n00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.930\nAnd when you see that,\nif you do not see k9 in it,\n\n484\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.352\nit will not support crypto.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's probably a pretty handy\n\n485\n00:25:47.352 --> 00:25:50.212\nthing to know.\n&gt;&gt; It is a very handy thing to know.\n\n486\n00:25:50.212 --> 00:25:51.530\n&gt;&gt; It comes through your iOS right?\n\n487\n00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a part of the iOS so\n\n488\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.510\nthat means that if you need it, you'll\neither have to get a service upgrade and\n\n489\n00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.210\nget the new iOS installed or\nyou'll have to get it somehow, okay?\n\n490\n00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.610\nSo that's what it is.\n\n491\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.190\nNow, remember that each one\nof these is specific to,\n\n492\n00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:10.650\nof course, the chassis itself as\nwell as it's now universal here,\n\n493\n00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.950\nmeans that it supports all\nthe versions that are out there.\n\n494\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.940\nSo it used to be where there was actually\nindividual versions like advanced\n\n495\n00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:22.240\nenterprise, advanced IP, IP-based\nLAN-based, I mean yeah, for switches.\n\n496\n00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.020\nI mean, there were so\nmany different ones, but\n\n497\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.040\ntoday they've all put it underneath\nlicensing packages under universal.\n\n498\n00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.330\nAnd then when you actually get ready and\nyou say which one you want,\n\n499\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.800\nyou go to Cisco, and\nwhich one do you want?\n\n500\n00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.800\nThey give you a key, and that unlocks\nthe one that you want to have, okay?\n\n501\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.090\nYou can test out these versions too and\n\n502\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.158\nthere are guides out there that allow\nyou to do that, that you can run a test.\n\n503\n00:26:44.158 --> 00:26:46.860\nIt is supposed to be a limited\ntrial period, when you do that.\n\n504\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.550\nThe last time I did this it was actually\nan unlimited trial period, is what it was.\n\n505\n00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.350\nIt tells you of course, even the version.\n\n506\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.732\nSo on this router it is running 15.2.\n\n507\n00:26:55.732 --> 00:27:00.704\nYou wanna make sure that any IOS version\nthat you are using matches up to the exam.\n\n508\n00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:04.580\nThat's gonna be at least version 15,\nthe later the better normally,\n\n509\n00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.530\non this one too, okay.\n\n510\n00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.790\nSo the entire name here has some stuff\nthat you want to pay attention to just\n\n511\n00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.740\nbriefly, so\nlike here where it says MZ, right?\n\n512\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.520\nSo what this tells you\nat least the file and\n\n513\n00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.350\nhow it's stored is that it's designed\nto run in memory which is the m here,\n\n514\n00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.270\nthis lowercase m, Z stands for\nthat is a zipped file.\n\n515\n00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:33.000\nFrom that point, these additional letters\nalso add in different features a version.\n\n516\n00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.610\nThe minor version number and then\nthe update number, like this 15 2-4, and\n\n517\n00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:45.090\nthen this M6 is another special feature or\nupdate set that you might have also done.\n\n518\n00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.320\nSo you'll see these\ncontinue to move along.\n\n519\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.520\nSometimes you'll actually see where if\nthey do something like they're testing,\n\n520\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.120\nit might be what they call\nthe different trains.\n\n521\n00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.590\nWhere it's actually designed to\nactually run in production or\n\n522\n00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.060\nit's designed for testing.\n\n523\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.010\nThere's is like a beta edition.\n\n524\n00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.490\nSo when you see that,\nyou also see different lettering and\n\n525\n00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.030\nnumbering for that.\n\n526\n00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.930\nAnd there's plenty of guides\nout there to help you.\n\n527\n00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.730\nYou are not getting that deep into it.\n\n528\n00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.330\nAs you go into CCMP,\nyou'll talk about every single part.\n\n529\n00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.800\nWe've kind of mentioned some of it here,\n\n530\n00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.600\nbut just as a note more than anything,\nall right.\n\n531\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.070\nSee what other type of\ninformation we can also find.\n\n532\n00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.060\nHere, of course,\nis the hardware that is on this too.\n\n533\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.920\nAnd then licensing info, if you have this.\n\n534\n00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.780\nHere's what they do, they call this\nthe UDI number, this is what you need if\n\n535\n00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:37.230\nyou're gonna get an updated license is\nthis particular type of package here.\n\n536\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.210\nSo altogether it actually forms, or,\n\n537\n00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.440\nyou take this PID,\nproduct id number, serial number and\n\n538\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:50.060\nof course even that and this number and\nit forms a nice long number for them.\n\n539\n00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.100\nSo on this universal package,\nyou'll see, here's kind of\n\n540\n00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.890\nall the different ones that are available\nand now the configuration register.\n\n541\n00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.820\nNow this one, Daniel, is kind of running\nstrangely because the configuration\n\n542\n00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.610\nregister's actually set up\nin password recovery mode.\n\n543\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.910\nAnd I can tell that because\nit has the four in the second\n\n544\n00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.500\ndigit here on the right hand side.\n\n545\n00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.870\nSo once you see that, then you know that\nthat's actually in password recovery,\n\n546\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.140\nwhich is weird.\n\n547\n00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.900\nMost of the time when you reboot this,\n\n548\n00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.020\nit's because somebody didn't reset\nit back to what it needs to be and\n\n549\n00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.730\nwe will get into that by the end of our\nseries here, but not at this point.\n\n550\n00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:34.558\nSo there is several pieces of information\nthat we can do at and see this.\n\n551\n00:29:34.558 --> 00:29:38.516\nNow Daniel that kinda ends it at least for\nthe initial device configuration.\n\n552\n00:29:38.516 --> 00:29:41.024\nThe only other thing that\nwe didn't do here and\n\n553\n00:29:41.024 --> 00:29:45.090\nwe'll just pick an interface at this\npoint is we didn't set an IP address.\n\n554\n00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:51.011\nNow we're gonna be doing this like\nI said just a little bit here,\n\n555\n00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:57.509\nbut lets do an interface and\nthis is gonna be gigabit Ethernet 0/0.\n\n556\n00:29:57.509 --> 00:30:04.073\nAnd then we just type in IP address,\n192.168.16.1.\n\n557\n00:30:04.073 --> 00:30:07.310\nMake sure we type in the subnet mask.\n\n558\n00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.330\nThe only other thing that you want\nto make sure that you also know and\n\n559\n00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.510\nthe differences between a router and\na switch,\n\n560\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.260\nthat will also help you on the exam too.\n\n561\n00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.880\nRemember that switches by default\nevery physical port is on routers,\n\n562\n00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.840\nevery port is off by default.\n\n563\n00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.240\nSo then we issue a no shutdown.\n\n564\n00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.380\nNow, if I now type this back in,\n\n565\n00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.076\nlet me go back into\nthe privileged exec mode here.\n\n566\n00:30:34.076 --> 00:30:39.554\nShow IP Interface\n\n567\n00:30:39.554 --> 00:30:44.830\nbrief, this is going to be one of the most\nhelpful commands that you want to run.\n\n568\n00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.530\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n569\n00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.710\nNotice how you start seeing some of\nthe information and what I just did here.\n\n570\n00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:56.090\nI want you to pay attention to\nthis idea of status and protocol.\n\n571\n00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.940\nOkay?\n\n572\n00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.420\nSo, here is the IP address that I\njust assigned to this interface.\n\n573\n00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.900\nThe status for\n\n574\n00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:07.790\nus is the same as that link light that\nactually says that we are connected.\n\n575\n00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.740\nAnd then protocol is the same as that\nlink protocol which means activity.\n\n576\n00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:19.160\nSo this is ready to actually go and\nit is also seeing activity as well.\n\n577\n00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.290\nNow notice the other ones.\n\n578\n00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.570\nThey're called administratively down.\n\n579\n00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.720\nThat means someone has actually turned\nit off by issuing a shutdown command.\n\n580\n00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.240\nAnd if it's shutdown administratively,\n\n581\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.750\nit also means that you're\nnot gonna receive traffic.\n\n582\n00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.580\nIf you just see this as being\ndown that means the device is on,\n\n583\n00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.760\nsomebody didn't actually\nissue to turn it off.\n\n584\n00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.330\nIt just means it doesn't see\nthe link light on the other side or\n\n585\n00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.440\nthe electricity at the other end of this.\n\n586\n00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.120\nSo every once in a while you may have\nsomething like that where, especially,\n\n587\n00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.800\non routers,\nyou forget to turn it on, okay?\n\n588\n00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.920\nThose are just fairly certain things,\nbut you can see this.\n\n589\n00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.860\nSo, Daniel, that kinda really wraps\nup just about everything that we\n\n590\n00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.210\nhave in the initial device configuration.\n\n591\n00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.500\nWe still need to go through and\n\n592\n00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.250\nstart actually settings this\nup on multiple interfaces.\n\n593\n00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.610\nSo well do that and\nsee like IP version 4 and\n\n594\n00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.110\nIP version 6 addresses on these\ninterfaces and how they actually get\n\n595\n00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.280\nto work on these devices too.\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\n\n596\n00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.480\njust when we thought we were done with\nthat whole IP versioning business.\n\n597\n00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.490\nHere it rears its ugly head so\nthat we actually have to tell it, hey,\n\n598\n00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.790\nyou have an address so that you\ncan talk to other network devices,\n\n599\n00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.810\nkind of the purpose of\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n600\n00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:27.400\nVery good stuff.\n\n601\n00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.290\nWe look forward to that.\n\n602\n00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.990\nRight?\nSo thanks for joining us today.\n\n603\n00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.740\nAlways a pleasure to have on this show.\n\n604\n00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.730\nI was supposed to have you good\nfolks ou there watching boredoms\n\n605\n00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately,\n\n606\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.440\nwe're out of tim\n&gt;&gt; We have to do,\n\n607\n00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.500\nwe have to do you wanna know the important\none in the series we have to go so\n\n608\n00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.620\ndon't worry about that.\n\n609\n00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.170\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie\n\n610\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:43.982\n&gt;&gt; I'm Ronnie Wong and\n\n611\n00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:45.040\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n612\n00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:52.088\n[MUSIC]\n\n613\n00:32:52.088 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.214\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.780\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.938\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:22.359\nIn today's episode we continue on with\nmore in our CCENT series, and joining us,\n\n10\n00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.844\nyou and I, that's right.\n\n11\n00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:25.395\nThe man, the myth, the legend.\n\n12\n00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:26.630\nYou know him as Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.370\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n14\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.220\nHow's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.605\n&gt;&gt; It's going fine, Daniel, as we\ncontinue on our CCENTjourney together.\n\n16\n00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:33.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's so\n\n17\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.420\nmuch material for us to learn, and\nthis is kind of the first time.\n\n18\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.350\nFor several episodes now,\n\n19\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.990\nwe've been spending time in labs and\nwe start to continue on.\n\n20\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.420\nSo we want you to get full hands on, even\nas much material as I kind of spurt out\n\n21\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.590\nat the very beginning where\nwe didn't touch anything.\n\n22\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.980\nYou do need to know that\nfoundational knowledge there, but\n\n23\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.500\nalso we're getting more Cisco specific.\n\n24\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.992\nBut now we get to come back to, well, one\nof our favorite topics of all time Daniel,\n\n25\n00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.594\nwhich of course is gonna be subneting.\n\n26\n00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:01.124\nGo ahead.\n\n27\n00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:01.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, I guess.\n\n28\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.790\nSo now everybody now this is\nreal in this sense right?\n\n29\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540\nIt's not that you have to know\nsomething in all reality, right?.\n\n30\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.900\nIn most networks, don't get me wrong, they\ncan say you need to be able to subnet.\n\n31\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.760\nDaniel, you and\nI are just gonna go out to the Internet,\n\n32\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.690\nwe're gonna download a subnet calculator\nand go, tell me what size you need.\n\n33\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.667\nAnd we are off and ready to go.\n\n34\n00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.723\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's about how it's gonna\n\n35\n00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:22.302\nwork, Ronnie.\n\n36\n00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:24.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I got time and it ain't for that.\n\n37\n00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:25.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's not for that.\n\n38\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.340\nBut on Cisco exams though you\nwill not get away from that.\n\n39\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.720\nYou will not be able to\nuse subnet calculator and\n\n40\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.020\nyou have to do this quickly.\n\n41\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.520\nAnd so, that is the key.\n\n42\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.530\nSubnetting is a topic,\nonce you learn it it's great,\n\n43\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.870\nbecause you now know something that most\npeople are not going to know how to do.\n\n44\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.190\nBut then when you can do it very quickly,\nit also is not only impressive but it\n\n45\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.340\nworks to your advantage, especially, when\nsetting up something like an environment\n\n46\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.000\nfor a lab or even just a regular\noffice environment in terms of design.\n\n47\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.290\nSo one of the key elements that\nwe've actually been doing so\n\n48\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.620\nfar in our subnetting,\nis that we've talked about, of course,\n\n49\n00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.530\njust dividing up network blocks, right?\n\n50\n00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.290\nSo we now have learned intervals.\n\n51\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.790\nWe now know kind of secret, tricky methods\nthat can help you to get faster and\n\n52\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.970\neverything else.\n\n53\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.670\nBut there's another side to this,\n\n54\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.870\nin which is another way that they can\nattack you on the, attack in front of it.\n\n55\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.330\nThey can question you on the exam that\nyou want to also pay attention to.\n\n56\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.665\nSo that's what we're gonna go over.\n\n57\n00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.764\nWe're gonna go over some basic\nsubnetting again, because you and\n\n58\n00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.715\nI are going to configure our own network.\n\n59\n00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:33.892\nBut actually, three different networks,\nbut we're given only one IP address and\n\n60\n00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:36.830\nwe have to come up and\ndetermine those on our own.\n\n61\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.160\nWe get them wrong, okay?\n\n62\n00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.560\nIt means your network is\nnot going to function.\n\n63\n00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.500\nSo this is one of those key things.\n\n64\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.331\nNow at some point on the Cisco exam\nI took, that was pretty much it.\n\n65\n00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.769\nThe first thing was,\nhere's what you have to determine.\n\n66\n00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.830\nYou need 32 different networks, and they\nhave to support this many devices each.\n\n67\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.352\nAnd then,\n\n68\n00:02:57.352 --> 00:03:01.550\nyou have to be able to actually create\n30 additional point to point networks.\n\n69\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.090\nYou don't get a lot of time in doing that,\nso\n\n70\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.060\nyou have to be able to\ndo this stuff quickly.\n\n71\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.260\nHere's an example, let's say at the CCENT\nlevel and CCNA level, that you might see.\n\n72\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.945\nNow let's go back.\n\n73\n00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.944\nSo this is kind of like the quiz again,\nso we'll take a look at my screen.\n\n74\n00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:17.881\nThis should help us out, I hope.\n\n75\n00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:20.573\nI thought I had changed the font size,\nwhere we could see that.\n\n76\n00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:23.635\nLet me see if I can bump that up\njust a little bit more now that I\n\n77\n00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:25.350\nsee it on the screen here.\n\n78\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.670\nIt looks a little bit more\ndiminutive than I thought.\n\n79\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.570\n&gt;&gt; Might be able to just do the Ctrl plus.\n\n80\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's right I didn't think about that.\n\n81\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.870\nLet's just do that then, and\nthat way I won't have to, there we go.\n\n82\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.310\nThat should be, yeah, that will work.\n\n83\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.969\nSo right up there at\nthe top edge of the screen.\n\n84\n00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.401\nLet's say that this is what we had, right?\n\n85\n00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:48.830\nWe assigned that 192.168.16.0 network,\nwhich gives us 254 host, okay?\n\n86\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.320\nBut we are told that we\nneed three networks.\n\n87\n00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.880\nBut this time though Daniel,\nit's not only three equal sized networks.\n\n88\n00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.920\nSo now, this gets a little bit trickier.\n\n89\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.600\n&gt;&gt; The plot twist.\n\n90\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe didn't do really a lot of this.\n\n91\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.875\nWe kind of mentioned it, and\nthat's because this topic actually is more\n\n92\n00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:07.310\nprevalent inside the CCNA routing and\nswitching.\n\n93\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.340\nSo you're saying, well, Ronnie,\nwhy are you doing this now?\n\n94\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.750\nIt's part of this idea of running\nthrough our practice labs together,\n\n95\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.630\nand this is the environment that\nthey give us to do as well.\n\n96\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.550\nI've just kind of streamlined\na lot of it down, so\n\n97\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.660\nthat we can see it easier than\nthe way that they have it in lab out.\n\n98\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.950\nSo I need, of course, one network\nthat supports 110 IP addresses.\n\n99\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.040\nOne that supports 55 IP addresses,\nand one that 25 IP addresses.\n\n100\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.140\nAnd so this is different.\n\n101\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.050\nBefore we were just looking for\nnetwork interval blocks, right?\n\n102\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.260\nEqual sized networks,\nwe could do all day long now.\n\n103\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.270\nBut now I'm saying wait,\nyou need to be able to say,\n\n104\n00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.550\nhow many network hosts do\nI support in one network?\n\n105\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.757\nSo it's opposite in this way.\n\n106\n00:04:48.757 --> 00:04:52.426\nBefore I was telling you like, figure\nout how many additional bits, right,\n\n107\n00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.805\nthat we borrow from what the host portion,\nokay?\n\n108\n00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:59.291\nBut this time we want to ask a different\nquestion if we're asked this,\n\n109\n00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:03.940\nhow many of the 32 bits of an IP version\n4 address do I need to conserve?\n\n110\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.521\nIn other words, how many do I want\nthe network portion to invade in on, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:12.820\nSo I know that I can subnet and\nborrow more host bits.\n\n112\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.019\nBut this time I'm saying,\nhow many am I protecting?\n\n113\n00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.110\nHow many am I conserving?\n\n114\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.011\n&gt;&gt; How many will be left?\n\n115\n00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:17.680\n&gt;&gt; Left, yeah.\n\n116\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.956\n&gt;&gt; Instead of what we're borrowing.\n\n117\n00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:19.523\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n118\n00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:23.693\nthat way when you are asked a question\nlike this work from the other side and go.\n\n119\n00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:28.665\nAll right, they're asking for\na 110 of these IP addresses.\n\n120\n00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:33.485\nSo how many bits will give me that\nis what I want to determine, okay?\n\n121\n00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:38.098\nSo if we were to do something like this\nhere, I would actually be able to take\n\n122\n00:05:38.098 --> 00:05:42.660\n110 and I could run through my binary\nconversion if I wanted to do that.\n\n123\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.155\nSo we'll kind of do a quick\none right here, okay?\n\n124\n00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:47.770\nSo here's how I do the binary conversion,\nDaniel.\n\n125\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.190\nI want people to understand the logic\nprocess that I do slowly, and\n\n126\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.292\nthen you'll speed this up as you go along.\n\n127\n00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:58.463\nSo if I was given 110 at this point, I\nknow like right in front of me right now,\n\n128\n00:05:58.463 --> 00:05:59.916\nin my mind, there is what?\n\n129\n00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:01.929\nThose eight binary places, right?\n\n130\n00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:08.446\n128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and\nI may have known binary.\n\n131\n00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:09.620\nI don't know it now, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.370\nSo this is the way that I would do it.\n\n133\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.300\nI would just go ahead and write down a 0,\ncuz I know 120 is too big.\n\n134\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.180\n&gt;&gt; But then I would take the 64,\n\n136\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.190\nbecause I know that that's exactly\nwhat I need that will help me out.\n\n137\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.172\nAnd I could start subtracting,\nbut I’m not gonna do that,\n\n138\n00:06:24.172 --> 00:06:25.688\nbecause in my mind it\ndoesn't work that way.\n\n139\n00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:27.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's kind of weird.\n\n140\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.214\nBut I know if I do 64 plus 32,\nthat gives me 96.\n\n141\n00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:33.505\nNow I can subtract 110 a little\nbit easier on my end, right?\n\n142\n00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:35.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n143\n00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:39.027\n&gt;&gt; So if I start to do that,\nthen I realize something that-\n\n144\n00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:39.704\n&gt;&gt; Sixteen?\n\n145\n00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:44.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't add 32 in there, because\nif I do that, if I add in 96 plus 32,\n\n146\n00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:49.291\nyou know that's going to be, [CROSSTALK],\nthat's gonna give me over 128.\n\n147\n00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:52.750\nSo I know, I can't do that 32.\n\n148\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.190\nBut now if I do that 96 plus 1,\nthat's still too much.\n\n149\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.280\nThat gives me a 112 at this point,\nif my mind is actually working correctly.\n\n150\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.870\nSo I can't do that, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.720\nSo now 16 is gone.\n\n152\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.550\nSo now if I do a 96 plus 8 though,\nokay, right?\n\n153\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.930\n96 plus 9, that gives me a 104, okay?\n\n154\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.110\nThen I need the 4, and\n\n155\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.250\nthat now gives me 100 and, wait,\nI don't need the 4, I need the 2, right?\n\n156\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.080\nNow there we go, so\n\n157\n00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.740\nlets verify this, because if not I\nhave to do this again and make sure.\n\n158\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.220\nSo here is 96, okay?\n\n159\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.800\n96 plus, see, I did it wrong, okay?\n\n160\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.760\nSo I need 96 plus 8, so\nthat's the one that I needed.\n\n161\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.772\nI did it wrong here.\n\n162\n00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:52.251\n96 plus the 8,\nthat gives me the 102 in that, right?\n\n163\n00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.612\nLet me make sure,\n&gt;&gt; 96 and 8.\n\n164\n00:07:54.612 --> 00:07:55.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see.\n\n165\n00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:59.402\n96, [LAUGH] plus 8,\n&gt;&gt; 104.\n\n166\n00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:02.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is actually 104, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:02.142 --> 00:08:05.175\nSo now I do need that 4.\n\n168\n00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:10.580\nAnd I need that 2, and then I need the 0,\nso as long as that's 8 bits here, okay?\n\n169\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.180\nSo that's what it turns out to be.\n\n170\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.764\nI just need to make sure that I divide it.\n\n171\n00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:14.391\nSo there it is.\n\n172\n00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:20.603\nIt's 64 + 32, which is 96,\n+ 8, which you said was 104.\n\n173\n00:08:20.603 --> 00:08:24.582\nAnd then 104 + 4 is-\n&gt;&gt; 108.\n\n174\n00:08:24.582 --> 00:08:26.998\n&gt;&gt; 108, and then + 2 is 110.\n\n175\n00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:28.850\nI don't know why I was counting 112.\n\n176\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.930\nMy head is just doing it wrong, okay?\n\n177\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.110\nSo that is at now, and\nwhat do I do from this point?\n\n178\n00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.850\nHow many bits do I need to conserve?\n\n179\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.722\nWell I know at this point for\nus if I were to do this,\n\n180\n00:08:39.722 --> 00:08:44.171\nI need to actually conserve\n[SOUND] this many bits, okay?\n\n181\n00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:47.015\nSo that is gonna be 7 of those bits.\n\n182\n00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:52.867\nSo I simply take this number,\n32, and I subtract out 7.\n\n183\n00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:56.699\nAnd that now leaves me with 25, okay?\n\n184\n00:08:56.699 --> 00:09:00.254\nSo the great thing about 25, right,\n\n185\n00:09:00.254 --> 00:09:05.004\nthat is gonna be my slash notation for\nCIDER, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:07.384\nSo now, if I change that to binary,\n\n187\n00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.900\nThat's what it looks like, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.848\nSo then, if I now change that back\nto what I know about a subnet mask,\n\n189\n00:09:26.922 --> 00:09:32.834\n255.255.255.128, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:37.770\nSo now I have this number that I know\n\n191\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.930\nthat's going to help me to determine\nwhat my first network is gonna be.\n\n192\n00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.950\nSo we would do the same thing\nhere with the idea of 55, right?\n\n193\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.460\nSo if we were to do the same thing,\n\n194\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.150\nthis time we're gonna do it a little\nbit quicker, at least I hope I am.\n\n195\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.770\nOkay, I know that 128 is too big for that.\n\n196\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.574\nI know that 64 is too big.\n\n197\n00:09:55.574 --> 00:10:00.115\nBut now I go to 32 and 16, that's 48.\n\n198\n00:10:00.115 --> 00:10:05.038\nIf I take 55 and I subtract out 48,\nthat should give me 17 or\n\n199\n00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.690\nsomething, if I remember right.\n\n200\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.343\nIs that right, yeah, or a 7, 8, 9.\n\n201\n00:10:12.343 --> 00:10:13.140\nYeah, something like that.\n\n202\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.285\nLet's see, see,\nthis is where my math [INAUDIBLE].\n\n203\n00:10:15.285 --> 00:10:16.153\n&gt;&gt; He sure knows math, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:17.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my math just starts killing me.\n\n205\n00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:18.340\n&gt;&gt; Bring out the calculator.\n\n206\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.540\n&gt;&gt; So let's just do that.\n\n207\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.860\nSo let's just do 55 and then 48 here.\n\n208\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.477\nSo if we subtract that\nout that should be a 7.\n\n209\n00:10:28.477 --> 00:10:29.960\nYeah, that's right, see, 7.\n\n210\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.824\nJiminy Cricket, I told you I can't add.\n\n211\n00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:34.430\nSo yeah, normally when you do that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is fun.\n\n212\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is fun, and so\nit allows you just to see here, okay?\n\n213\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.497\nSo this is what I start doing.\n\n214\n00:10:39.497 --> 00:10:42.090\nAnd once you start getting fast at it,\nyou start doing it.\n\n215\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.049\nNow once I start seeing this,\nI now can go up to my binary.\n\n216\n00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:50.709\nAnd I realize that I can\nessentially conserve\n\n217\n00:10:50.709 --> 00:10:54.763\nthese 6 bits, so then I get 32- 6.\n\n218\n00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:59.576\nAnd now that allows me to do this,\nwhich is gonna be 26, which,\n\n219\n00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.470\nremember in the slider, equals /26 here.\n\n220\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.095\nAnd you just continue on.\n\n221\n00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:09.192\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\nconvert it to 255.255.255.\n\n222\n00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:10.813\nThat's the first 24 bits.\n\n223\n00:11:10.813 --> 00:11:15.580\nAnd then 1 1, which is 128 + 64,\nwhich is 192.\n\n224\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.450\nSo there is my new subnet mask there.\n\n225\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.720\nLast one here for 25 addresses,\nonce again, one more time here.\n\n226\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.570\nI know that I'm not gonna do the first\nthree, right, cuz 32 is that last number.\n\n227\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.230\nThat's not gonna help me at all.\n\n228\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.244\nBut then I can do,\nonce I get to that, 16, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:33.244 --> 00:11:37.278\nSo now if I take 25 and I subtract out 16,\n\n230\n00:11:37.278 --> 00:11:42.880\nthat should give me 9, hopefully,\nis what that gives me.\n\n231\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed, Ronnie. [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then there we go, okay?\n\n232\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:51.500\nSo at this point, Oops, I can't even\nput the line where I wanted it to.\n\n233\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.790\nI simply divide out there, cuz 2 to\nthe fifth power will give me 30, okay?\n\n234\n00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.198\nThis, 2 to the 6th power, will give me 64.\n\n235\n00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:03.990\nAnd this should give me 32, sorry.\n\n236\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:09.049\n32, 64 and 128, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:11.720\nSo this way we do the same thing here.\n\n238\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:19.108\nWe subtract out 5, and this will be 27,\nwhich remember is actually a /27.\n\n239\n00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:22.490\nAnd that means the first\n24 bits will be the same.\n\n240\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:29.780\nAnd then, with the three 1s in a row,\nthat's 128 + 64 and 192 + 32 is 224.\n\n241\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:35.350\nSo that way you can get a little bit\nquicker at understanding that, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.866\nNow once I do that I now\nhave the basic information I\n\n243\n00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:43.890\nneed to determine the network sizes and\nwhat has to happen here.\n\n244\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.933\nI always determine it,\nat least in my mind, from the largest\n\n245\n00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:50.872\nnetwork to the smallest network, cuz I\ntry to start small and then try to figure\n\n246\n00:12:50.872 --> 00:12:54.420\nout where the network division happens,\nit's not gonna work for me.\n\n247\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.200\nI've tried it before and\nit takes a lot longer.\n\n248\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.040\n&gt;&gt; A good way to mess yourself right up,\nRon.\n\n249\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nat least that's what happened to me.\n\n250\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:06.110\nSo the great thing is I already know this\nsubnet mask, which is gonna be 128, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.740\nSo Daniel,\nif we used that magic number method,\n\n252\n00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.890\nright, we know the magic number is 256.\n\n253\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.730\nMy action octect says 128, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.422\nSo if I subtract that out\nits gotta be 128, right?\n\n255\n00:13:20.422 --> 00:13:24.793\nOkay, so if my network number begins\nat 0 and then the next network is 128,\n\n256\n00:13:24.793 --> 00:13:26.201\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n257\n00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:26.974\nThat's it, okay?\n\n258\n00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:29.928\nSo that's it thats all\nI have available to me.\n\n259\n00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:35.820\nSo at this point, if I wanted to\nstart off with that 192.168.16,\n\n260\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.550\nI'm gonna start off with a 0 network.\n\n261\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:45.532\nAnd then I'm gonna do a /25 for\nthe network ID, as well, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:45.532 --> 00:13:48.499\nOr I could just do, once again,\nthe new subnet mask.\n\n263\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.449\nSo that range then, Daniel, without\never having to do any more binary again,\n\n264\n00:13:56.449 --> 00:14:01.697\nwe know that the range actually starts\nwith one up from the network ID, right?\n\n265\n00:14:01.697 --> 00:14:06.128\nAnd then 192.168.16 here, the broadcast,\n\n266\n00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:11.603\nI know that this is gonna be\nthe next network, right, 0 and 128.\n\n267\n00:14:11.603 --> 00:14:16.173\nWell the broadcast would be 127,\nso that means my range is 126.\n\n268\n00:14:16.173 --> 00:14:23.066\nAnd now the broadcast here,\nthat's gonna be 192.168.16.127, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:27.090\nSo you can continue to do that and\nyou work that out.\n\n270\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.412\nAnd this is now where gets a little bit\nmore, if you haven't done this before,\n\n271\n00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:32.275\nit now begins.\n\n272\n00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:36.915\nAll right, so now that l know that\nthat network is 0 through 127,\n\n273\n00:14:36.915 --> 00:14:41.555\nwell now if l go to that next bigger\nnetwork size, which is gonna be for\n\n274\n00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:43.886\n55 addresses, now what do l do?\n\n275\n00:14:43.886 --> 00:14:49.448\nl can start at 128, okay, because\nthat's still an the interval of 64,\n\n276\n00:14:49.448 --> 00:14:51.880\nright, 0, 64, and128.\n\n277\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:57.068\nSo here, the new subnet mask, 255.255.192,\n\n278\n00:14:57.068 --> 00:15:03.724\nokay, is gonna be, make sure I'm\ntelling you right here, yeah,192.\n\n279\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:11.790\nAnd now for this one, 192.168.16.\n\n280\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:16.236\nAnd then the network ID\nis gonna begin at 128,\n\n281\n00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:20.363\n255.255.255.192, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:20.363 --> 00:15:24.579\nI don't want to go into what that larger\nnetwork, so If I start at 126 or 64,\n\n283\n00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:26.942\nI'm actually in that bigger network there.\n\n284\n00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:30.998\nSo I've jumped to the next network\ninterval that's not going to overlap\n\n285\n00:15:30.998 --> 00:15:32.202\nthe original range.\n\n286\n00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:35.953\nSo I begin at 128 here.\n\n287\n00:15:35.953 --> 00:15:43.916\nSo this now means my new\nnetwork's range is 192.168.129.\n\n288\n00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:48.003\nIt'll be 192.168.16.\n\n289\n00:15:48.003 --> 00:15:53.611\nAnd this one, though, it should be\nif I now do increments of 64, right?\n\n290\n00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:58.095\nOkay, so remember,\nwe take our magic number 256.\n\n291\n00:15:58.095 --> 00:15:59.560\nWe subtract out 192.\n\n292\n00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.243\nThat gives us 64.\n\n293\n00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:03.816\nSo if I were to do this,\neven starting at 0, right?\n\n294\n00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:07.598\n0 64.128 is where I'm beginning.\n\n295\n00:16:07.598 --> 00:16:12.387\nMy next network is 192, so\nI know that that's actually gonna be\n\n296\n00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:16.330\nthe very next network here,\nwhich is gonna be 192.\n\n297\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:22.182\nSo my broadcast is gonna be 191,\nwhich means my range is 190.\n\n298\n00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:31.745\nAnd there we go, and now that I have\nthat I know that the very next one,\n\n299\n00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:35.660\nif I do not want to overlap\nthis particular network.\n\n300\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.529\nI need one for the 32, so\n\n301\n00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:43.497\nnow the subnet mask is\ngoing to be 224 there\n\n302\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:52.024\nAnd now for this one,\non the network ID 192.168.16,\n\n303\n00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:57.973\nnow we have to kind of go, all right,\nso we just went from 128 to 64.\n\n304\n00:16:57.973 --> 00:17:03.320\nSo I know that at this point,\nif the next network is supposed to be 192,\n\n305\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.184\nthat is fine with me right here, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:12.702\nBecause I still know something if\nI go 32 is like 0, 32, 64, 96,\n\n307\n00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:18.090\n128, and then 160, 192 I can start it 192.\n\n308\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:22.795\nSo I now know that 192 is the network ID,\nand\n\n309\n00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:29.925\nthen that means once again 1 up\nfrom the network ID, which is 193.\n\n310\n00:17:32.194 --> 00:17:36.489\n16 here, and\nnow I have to go wait a minute.\n\n311\n00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:38.310\n&gt;&gt; You got some typo there my man.\n\n312\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.981\n&gt;&gt; Did I?\nWhich one is that?\n\n313\n00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:42.034\n&gt;&gt; 193 is different than 192.\n\n314\n00:17:43.781 --> 00:17:46.160\nBack, back, back, back, back,\nback, back, back, back, back.\n\n315\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.740\nAll right, so there we go, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:55.669\nSo now, I just have to do an increment of\n32 at this point to find the next network.\n\n318\n00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:59.598\nSo 192+32, that's gonna give me 224,\n\n319\n00:17:59.598 --> 00:18:03.440\nwhich means that my\nbroadcast should be 223.\n\n320\n00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.522\nSo this is gonna be 222 223, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:11.213\n&gt;&gt; Lovely.\n\n322\n00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:15.418\n&gt;&gt; So, disregarding my typos-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:17.520\n&gt;&gt; It does work out in my ability to try\n\n324\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.800\nand add in my head the way that I\nthought I could, it actually does that.\n\n325\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.800\nSo you can actually see where this\ncan be done relatively quickly.\n\n326\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.150\nAs you start practicing this more and more\nin your head and try to determine that,\n\n327\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.080\nit's get better.\n\n328\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.260\nNow for me, it's just because it's been\na few days before I've actually done this.\n\n329\n00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.430\nSo, as I start doing this faster and\n\n330\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.810\nmore often it's actually gonna come\ninto my mind a little bit quicker.\n\n331\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:43.680\nSo, this is part of you learning how\nto do this if given this scenario.\n\n332\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.410\nThen, at that point, their gonna give\nyou a diagram that's gonna say hey,\n\n333\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.710\nhere's where this network needs to go.\n\n334\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.600\nAnd then you'll have your pool of IP\naddresses that then you can assign to\n\n335\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.460\nwhatever devices that are there as\nlong as you remember what they are.\n\n336\n00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:02.170\nThen you actually took another exam\nwhere you didn't even get a diagram.\n\n337\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.570\nIt was like here it is and\nthen you had to make your own diagram and\n\n338\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.460\nthen you had to find the devices and\n\n339\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.810\nactually go all right,\nhere is how that's gonna end up working.\n\n340\n00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.250\nAnd make that all happen,\nso it can be done, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.840\nIt's just one of these\nthings where at this point,\n\n342\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.500\nyou need that practice to make sure\nthat you understand how to do it.\n\n343\n00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.570\nWhen we're asked for just,\nwe just need this many networks, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.840\nWell, once again, you know exactly what\nyou can do there, and then you're fine.\n\n345\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.190\nBut if you're asked like,\n\n346\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.540\nhere's three different sized networks make\nsure you go from the other side instead.\n\n347\n00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.540\nDon't borrow more network bits, but\n\n348\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.260\ninstead conserve host bits instead and\nthen you can determine this.\n\n349\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.600\nThe key is not overlapping and the easiest\nway to determine that is start with\n\n350\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.100\nthe biggest number and\nthen go to the next interval.\n\n351\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.590\nYou start with the smallest one and\nyou start intervalling from there.\n\n352\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.540\nYou waste a lot of space in between and\n\n353\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.990\nit just doesn't work as well\nin that sense of trying to.\n\n354\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.420\nCan you do it?\nYes, but\n\n355\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.540\nit's not gonna be what you want it\nto be when it comes out in the end.\n\n356\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.750\nSo this conserves the address\nbase nicely packed.\n\n357\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.610\nWe now have three different networks,\nso three different sizes\n\n358\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:13.570\nall within that one address space is\nwhat we have available to us, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.330\nSo once we get that,\n\n360\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:21.170\nnow we can start configuring some of the\ndifferent devices here with IP addresses.\n\n361\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.830\nSo let's go ahead and also do that.\n\n362\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:30.689\nNow at least we are going to try and\ndo that right now.\n\n363\n00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:36.647\nLet's see if I can get to this\nrouter that is currently busy.\n\n364\n00:20:36.647 --> 00:20:39.606\nAll right, so EDGE came on here and\n\n365\n00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:45.030\nnow we are ready to configure\nsome IP addresses on this router.\n\n366\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:51.950\nSo let's go ahead and do so, from the user\nmode, let me get into privilege exec mode,\n\n367\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:57.993\nthen l want to get into\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n368\n00:20:57.993 --> 00:21:01.380\nAnd so now l am actually in\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n369\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.129\nl am ready to start down putting some\ndifferent IP addresses on some interface\n\n370\n00:21:06.129 --> 00:21:11.188\nthere, because I'm connecting multiple\nnetworks together is what I'm doing.\n\n371\n00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:12.366\nThe NYEDGE for me,\n\n372\n00:21:12.366 --> 00:21:17.850\nI'm gonna actually connect into the 16.0\nnetwork is what I'm going to do.\n\n373\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.537\nSo on gigabit 0/0,\nthat is what's gonna happen.\n\n374\n00:21:21.537 --> 00:21:24.367\nSo if I type in interface,\n\n375\n00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:30.180\nthen I can actually type\nin gigabitEthernet 0/0.\n\n376\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.340\nNow even if you have spaces in there and\n\n377\n00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.710\neven if it doesn't report\nthat way in the command line.\n\n378\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.450\nIt will still accept it because\nit doesn't it just takes it.\n\n379\n00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.621\nSo space or not it doesn't matter\nas far as the interface names go.\n\n380\n00:21:43.621 --> 00:21:47.160\nA lot of times you'll actually see\nthem typed in together or separately.\n\n381\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.310\nIt's not gonna bring you\nto a different place.\n\n382\n00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.539\nThen IP address 192.168.16.1.\n\n383\n00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:57.800\nThen I need to make sure I type\nin the proper subnet mask,\n\n384\n00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.470\nsince we are doing a simply\nvariable link subnet masking.\n\n385\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.970\nIf you get this wrong,\nit's gonna fail, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.020\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat you verify that, too.\n\n387\n00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.436\nThen, on a router, because the router\ninterfaces are turned off by default.\n\n388\n00:22:11.436 --> 00:22:15.360\nMake sure you're issuing no shutdown\nturned on and there we go Daniel.\n\n389\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.840\nYou start seeing where it\nsays linked up down and\n\n390\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.400\nnow also line protocol up down as well,\nokay?\n\n391\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.740\nIf it goes ahead and\nchanges down and then comes up,\n\n392\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.100\nit's fine as long as it stays up.\n\n393\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.350\nIf it comes up and then goes back down,\nthen more than likely you need to\n\n394\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.630\ntroubleshoot and figure out\nwhat's going on at the other end.\n\n395\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know a lot of\ntimes it's just the fact that\n\n396\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.200\nthere is nothing configured\non the other end.\n\n397\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.900\nSo it just says,\nhey yeah we are configured but\n\n398\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.950\nnothings actually happening.\n\n399\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.282\nSo we are just gonna shut\ndown until something happens.\n\n400\n00:22:41.282 --> 00:22:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nactually that's a pretty valid idea right.\n\n401\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.580\nIt says, I can see that I'm\nconnected to something cuz\n\n402\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.110\nI got a little bit of a line signal back.\n\n403\n00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.600\nBut then after that I was like\nI'm not getting anything back, so\n\n404\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.950\nlet me just go ahead and shutdown.\n\n405\n00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.530\nSo if you see that you might\nwanna check the other end and\n\n406\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.180\nverify that everything is actually goo,\nokay?\n\n407\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:22:59.870\nSo that is good.\n\n408\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:07.240\nNow I'm also gonna connect to the one\nwith the 32 or for the 25 host as well.\n\n409\n00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.520\nSo now I need to change interfaces.\n\n410\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.010\nNow, Daniel, I'm already inside\nof an interface command.\n\n411\n00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:19.250\nI haven't pointed that out before, notice\nhow the prompt has changed to config-if.\n\n412\n00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.800\nSo this is weird hierarchy.\n\n413\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.820\nI would think that you would\nactually do interface-config,\n\n414\n00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.340\nbut its because of the way that the\nhierarchy ends up working its config and\n\n415\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.370\nthen you have interface and\nthen you have some of the other things.\n\n416\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.886\nSo its just the way that\nthat thing is functioned.\n\n417\n00:23:32.886 --> 00:23:34.220\nMake sure you pay attention to this or\n\n418\n00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.000\nyou won't be able to configure\nIP addresses very easily.\n\n419\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.340\nSo I can go ahead from here without having\nto go all the way back out to the global\n\n420\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:47.140\nconfiguration mode and\nnow I can even do an abbreviation.\n\n421\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:53.135\nSo this time I just typed in like\nGI 0/1 and I'll press Enter.\n\n422\n00:23:53.135 --> 00:23:55.769\nNow when I did that,\nit's still accepted and\n\n423\n00:23:55.769 --> 00:24:00.493\nthat's because there is nothing else is\nexpecting with the keyword of gigabit.\n\n424\n00:24:00.493 --> 00:24:02.680\nThat's the only one that begins with gi.\n\n425\n00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.984\nNow if I started something like that,\nright?\n\n426\n00:24:04.984 --> 00:24:06.913\nAnd it goes,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n427\n00:24:06.913 --> 00:24:10.462\nIt would tell you, it's like, you don't\nhave enough here, it's ambiguous, or\n\n428\n00:24:10.462 --> 00:24:11.435\nsomething like that.\n\n429\n00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:14.560\nSo just realize when you do this, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.256\nThe other thing that we can do\nis we can abbreviate again more.\n\n431\n00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:21.746\nSo I always just do IP add for\nIP address here.\n\n432\n00:24:21.746 --> 00:24:23.836\nSo I'm just gonna do\nthis as an example and\n\n433\n00:24:23.836 --> 00:24:26.656\nhopefully remember to do\nthe rest the way that I need to.\n\n434\n00:24:30.554 --> 00:24:37.081\nAnd this is gonna be 224,\nand a no shut down, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:41.971\nSo now that we have the interfaces\non NYedge here, up and\n\n436\n00:24:41.971 --> 00:24:48.440\nready to go and you see where it is\nchanging its state and everything.\n\n437\n00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.440\nYou're hoping to see that.\n\n438\n00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.116\nThat this all is actually\nconfigured the way that we want to.\n\n439\n00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.580\nThe messages that you're\nseeing in between these,\n\n440\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.500\nthese are called syslog messages and\nthey are important.\n\n441\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.100\nBecause it does let you know whether or\nnot you've either got a configuration\n\n442\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.360\nchallenge, or there's a link challenge\nthat's right there and ready to go, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.409\nLet's just configure one end of this,\n\n444\n00:25:08.409 --> 00:25:11.588\ncuz we are coming up on the edge\nof our time limit here Daniel.\n\n445\n00:25:11.588 --> 00:25:18.500\nSo I am going to go down to NYWAN\nis what we are going to do here.\n\n446\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.460\nAnd from NYWAN, we're just gonna configure\nanother couple of interfaces here too.\n\n447\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.860\nNow on this one,\nwe're configuring the other side.\n\n448\n00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.304\nWe're gonna connect to\nthat zero dot network and\n\n449\n00:25:29.304 --> 00:25:33.427\nwe're also gonna connect to\nthat 128 network as well.\n\n450\n00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:38.072\nActually, we're connecting to the one that\nrequires the 64 addresses or 55 addresses,\n\n451\n00:25:38.072 --> 00:25:40.034\nis what we're also connecting to too.\n\n452\n00:25:40.034 --> 00:25:43.171\nSo everything is getting connected\nto that one big network, and\n\n453\n00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:46.787\nthen we're having two networks on\nthe side, is what we're seeing here.\n\n454\n00:25:46.787 --> 00:25:50.140\nLet me go into the global configuration\nmode, configure terminal.\n\n455\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.314\nAnd now with the interface\n\n456\n00:25:56.314 --> 00:26:00.945\ngigabit ethernet 0/0.\n\n457\n00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:04.396\nOnce again IP address.\n\n458\n00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:11.652\n192.168.16.2 and then the subnet mask.\n\n459\n00:26:14.249 --> 00:26:16.317\nThis should be 128.\n\n460\n00:26:16.317 --> 00:26:18.240\nAnd a a no shutdown.\n\n461\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.110\nNow, one of the hardest\nthings to actually do is,\n\n462\n00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.910\ndo I really need to do this on everything?\n\n463\n00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.650\nYes, to get it to work you do need to, but\nespecially in getting ready for the exam.\n\n464\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.380\nThis is the only way to build speed, okay?\n\n465\n00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.065\nYou've got to get that muscle\nmemory in your fingertips working.\n\n466\n00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:35.580\nAnd so that you know that if\nyou need to configure this\n\n467\n00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.520\nthat you're not guessing\nat what's the next command.\n\n468\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.120\nYou have to know exactly\nwhat is happening here.\n\n469\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.444\nSo for the next interface, so\ngenerally most people might back\n\n470\n00:26:46.444 --> 00:26:51.874\nout to the global config and\nthen enter back into the interface.\n\n471\n00:26:57.475 --> 00:27:05.028\nAnd then the IP address, and\nthis is gonna be 192.168.16.129 so\n\n472\n00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:08.196\nthis is for that second network.\n\n473\n00:27:11.895 --> 00:27:17.135\nAnd this would be 192 And\nthen issuing a no shutdown\n\n474\n00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:22.454\ncommand as well So\n\n475\n00:27:22.454 --> 00:27:26.340\nnow we're actually starting to see we're\nconfiguring these things on both sides.\n\n476\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.070\nWe are getting ready to get\neverything up and going, okay?\n\n477\n00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.570\nBut for\n\n478\n00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.890\nright now though, okay, that's all we've\ndone is we've configured IP addresses.\n\n479\n00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:41.100\nAnd as boring as that may sound,\nyou want to practice this, okay?\n\n480\n00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.810\nOn every interface that you can,\npractice the sub netting.\n\n481\n00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.790\nSet yourself up scenarios and\n\n482\n00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.160\nthen create at least two\ndifferent subnets if not three.\n\n483\n00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.290\nAnd just continue to work through that.\n\n484\n00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.640\nBut get your muscle memory down so\nthat this is fast, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.066\nThe other thing that one last thing\nthat I want to show you right here.\n\n486\n00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:05.870\nLet's type in show running-config,\noops, sorry.\n\n487\n00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.205\nI gotta do that from the mode here.\n\n488\n00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:10.620\nShow running-config.\n\n489\n00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.856\nI always forget to exit out\nof the global config mode.\n\n490\n00:28:14.856 --> 00:28:17.510\nMake sure you spend some\ntime looking at this.\n\n491\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.060\nThis will reveal everything in terms\nof your configuration, whether or\n\n492\n00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.990\nnot you've gotten it right or wrong, okay?\n\n493\n00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.895\nNow, sometimes this is going to\ngive you too much information.\n\n494\n00:28:27.895 --> 00:28:31.950\nOkay, so there are ways for\nyou to limit some of this down.\n\n495\n00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.050\nOkay, so lets say that this is really kind\nof the information I really wanted to set.\n\n496\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.375\nI didn't really care about\nanything that went before this.\n\n497\n00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.442\nWell you can just take\na little bit of time here,\n\n498\n00:28:41.442 --> 00:28:44.280\nlet me see if I can get to\nthe end here just briefly.\n\n499\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:51.210\nIf I now type in show running-config,\nI can do a pipe command.\n\n500\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.120\nAnd we'll be doing some of this\nas we continue to go through.\n\n501\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.410\nAnd I can tell it to\nbegin with the interface.\n\n502\n00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.920\nNow, here's where's where\nthe problem begins,\n\n503\n00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.170\nis I actually have to remember which is,\nit actually is lowercase.\n\n504\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.420\nThat's whaty kind of gets me sometimes.\n\n505\n00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.180\nIs I need to actually do this and\ntype it in exactly.\n\n506\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.272\nInterface, and then from that point here,\n\n507\n00:29:11.272 --> 00:29:15.379\nI can do gigabit,\nwhich this is case sensitive of course.\n\n508\n00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.040\nYeah, it is gigabit, ethernet.\n\n509\n00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.460\nMake sure that I typed that in right.\n\n510\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:26.236\nGigabit ethernet 0/0.\n\n511\n00:29:26.236 --> 00:29:30.938\nSo when I do this it should, of course,\nwhat did I type in wrong here?\n\n512\n00:29:34.026 --> 00:29:36.758\nI was gonna say,\nthat should actually show me that I,\n\n513\n00:29:36.758 --> 00:29:39.425\nI must have mistyped it somewhere.\n\n514\n00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:41.758\nGigabit, did I type it in right?\n\n515\n00:29:44.961 --> 00:29:47.748\nAll right, well,\nthen I'm lying to you then.\n\n516\n00:29:47.748 --> 00:29:50.850\nSo let me see if I can copy that,\nand do this again.\n\n517\n00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.777\nSo usually you can filter it down.\n\n518\n00:29:56.015 --> 00:29:59.150\nRunning-config, tell it to begin.\n\n519\n00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.380\nMaybe I have to type in the whole thing.\n\n520\n00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.117\nYeah, that's right, it doesn't accept\nabbreviations sometimes down here.\n\n521\n00:30:05.594 --> 00:30:06.979\nThere we go, okay?\n\n522\n00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:12.219\nSo now notice that when I did that time,\nso somehow I just didn't type it in.\n\n523\n00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:15.018\nI typed it in with a space\nat the beginning, so\n\n524\n00:30:15.018 --> 00:30:19.370\nwhen we do this In the filtering,\nit doesn't like the space.\n\n525\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.230\nSo it actually took the space out.\n\n526\n00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.320\nAnd notice where it started here, okay.\n\n527\n00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.414\nIt just starts to do that.\n\n528\n00:30:24.414 --> 00:30:25.940\nSo, it begins to give you that.\n\n529\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.630\nAnd we'll actually show you some of\nthe different ones that we'll have as\n\n530\n00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.160\nwe go along.\n\n531\n00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.256\nBut Daniel at this point,\nwe're right in the middle of this lab but\n\n532\n00:30:32.256 --> 00:30:33.925\nthis is a great place for us to stop.\n\n533\n00:30:33.925 --> 00:30:35.817\nWe've just got a couple\nmore interfaces to go, and\n\n534\n00:30:35.817 --> 00:30:37.810\nthen we need to do some troubleshooting.\n\n535\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.530\nAnd once we get that up and running,\nfirst of all we will verify that we have\n\n536\n00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.620\ngood connectivity all the way through,\nwhich is key.\n\n537\n00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.710\nAnd then we will do a little bit of\ntroubleshooting by breaking some things\n\n538\n00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.882\nand see where we go from there.\n\n539\n00:30:47.882 --> 00:30:50.760\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie well I am feeling good\nabout this episode because we are actually\n\n540\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.535\ngetting our hands dirty.\n\n541\n00:30:51.535 --> 00:30:56.410\nWe're actually taking that theory of,\nIPB4 and connecting interfaces and\n\n542\n00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.043\nmaking a network and what goes into that.\n\n543\n00:30:59.043 --> 00:31:01.390\nAnd we're applying it to\nthe actual system itself, so\n\n544\n00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.951\nwe can start making them talk and\nget the networks working.\n\n545\n00:31:03.951 --> 00:31:07.355\nSo I'm really looking forward to seeing\nwhat else we have to do to get all\n\n546\n00:31:07.355 --> 00:31:08.336\nthat squared away.\n\n547\n00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:10.485\nRonnie, so glad you could drop by today.\n\n548\n00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:15.262\nAppreciate you as always, and we thank\nyou good folks out there as well, but\n\n549\n00:31:15.262 --> 00:31:17.632\nas Ronnie has already said,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n550\n00:31:17.632 --> 00:31:18.800\n&gt;&gt; We are out of time.\n\n551\n00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.080\nAs it typically happens\nevery thirty minutes or so.\n\n552\n00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] When the clock runs out,\n\n553\n00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.410\nimagine that.\n\n554\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.902\nWe're signing off ITProTV.\n\n555\n00:31:24.902 --> 00:31:25.796\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n556\n00:31:25.796 --> 00:31:26.648\n&gt;&gt; And

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:16.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, thanks everyone and welcome\nback to another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.476\nI am your host, one Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:23.950\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are back with more in our CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.510\nJoining us back in the studio yet again,\nwell, you guessed it, it's Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.240\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.410\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel,\nthank you for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.117\nAs we're continuing on in our lab here,\ntaking a look at IP version 4 addressing.\n\n13\n00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:37.576\nRemember that the goal\nbehind this lab is not so\n\n14\n00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:41.802\nmuch if you don't know what an IP address\nis by now it is to build the muscle memory\n\n15\n00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.960\nto make sure you have the skills.\n\n16\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.920\nNot only to insert those things,\nbut to do it quickly, and\n\n17\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240\nthen of course verify that everything\nis up and running as well.\n\n18\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.682\nSo let's pickup where left off.\n\n19\n00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:55.820\nWe're gonna take a look at a diagram first\nthat I just quickly drew here in between\n\n20\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.240\nso that we could see what we've set up so\nfar, okay.\n\n21\n00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.700\nSo we've actually started\nconfiguring on NYEDGE,\n\n22\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.730\nwe configured two interfaces with\nthe different subnets as well.\n\n23\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.920\nSo one of these interfaces\nthat we configure 16.1, and\n\n24\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.960\nthen on NYWAN1 here, we actually\nconfigured the other N then connection.\n\n25\n00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.440\nSo we'll be able to verify\nthis connection as well.\n\n26\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.080\nWe also configured some\nother interfaces to,\n\n27\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680\nwell, these other different addresses too.\n\n28\n00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.270\nSo in this point here, I'm going to\nmake this assumption here that we will,\n\n29\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.081\nI don't think we will be\nusing this in our lab.\n\n30\n00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:37.958\nBut the whole goal and idea is that we are\ngonna make a connection that's more like\n\n31\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.785\nnot hopefully not like that.\n\n32\n00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that looks broken.\n\n33\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.230\nBut something like this in step.\n\n34\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.650\nAnd this is kind of a typical topology,\nDaniel, that we'll find and\n\n35\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.120\nif you wanna build a lab,\nthis is kind of a great topology to have.\n\n36\n00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.380\nWhether you wanna call it a triangle or\nthe upside down triangle,\n\n37\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.650\nwhatever it is, this gives you the ability\nto actually configure three different\n\n38\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.210\nnetworks in between.\n\n39\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.010\nAnd to do a lot of different ways that you\ncan even configure just point-to-point\n\n40\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.610\nlinks and some of the other things\nthat are out there and available.\n\n41\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.640\nSo it's a great lab topology\nto begin with, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.600\nSo that's what we've\nactually got set up so far.\n\n43\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.360\nNow, once we have this\nthings set up here and\n\n44\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.350\ndoing this, we're now continuing on in our\nnext step inside of our lab progress here.\n\n45\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.153\nLet me go ahead and\nswitch over to our lab machine so\n\n46\n00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:29.330\nthat I just wanna make sure that we were\nreminded of what we had available to us,\n\n47\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330\nand I'll switch on over to practice labs.\n\n48\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.986\nAnd where we had left off is that we\nwere just about to configure NY 41.\n\n49\n00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:43.280\nNow, NY 41 is a core\nswitch is a 3750 which is\n\n50\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.420\na pretty nice switch\nthat we have available.\n\n51\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.630\nAnd we wanna be able to use this also for\ntesting.\n\n52\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.530\nNow this is gonna go inside of that larger\nnetwork that we had as one of the 110\n\n53\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.076\ndevices in that big network that zero\ndot network we were talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:04.120\nSo the first thing I wanna do is I wanna\nassign an IP address to this device.\n\n55\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.458\nI do not get to assign it on an interface.\n\n56\n00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:10.718\nLet me, to make sure we can\nget access into this data.\n\n57\n00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:13.690\nNow, we can do enable.\n\n58\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.210\nAnd let's do a configure terminal.\n\n59\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.165\nAnd once I'm here,\nI need to configure an IP address of\n\n60\n00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:27.681\n192.168.16.3 with a /25 for a subnet mask.\n\n61\n00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:31.180\nSo this is where I go to interface.\n\n62\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.870\nBecause I cannot assign it\nonto a physical interface,\n\n63\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.140\nthis is gonna be the virtual interface.\n\n64\n00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.240\nTechnically, this virtual\ninterface is what's called an SVI,\n\n65\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.510\na Switched Virtual Interface.\n\n66\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.440\nFor all practical purposes, right, to you\nand me, we're assigning an IP address to\n\n67\n00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.180\nthis device, okay,\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n68\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.190\nSo if you ever see an IP\naddress assigned to VLAN 1,\n\n69\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.610\nyou're just saying, I'm using this and\nthis is how I get access to this device.\n\n70\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.430\n&gt;&gt; That can be a little\nconfusing because we're so\n\n71\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.970\nused to thinking, it goes on an interface.\n\n72\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.320\nThere's a plug that goes into this thing\nthat's making connections somewhere and\n\n73\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.340\nhere we are working with\nthe virtual interface, right?\n\n74\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.780\nBut, then when you're\nworking with a switch,\n\n75\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.230\nyou gotta keep that under wraps\nbecause that will catch up on an exam.\n\n76\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it will, very quickly and\neven in real production.\n\n77\n00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:20.840\n&gt;&gt; Real life land, yeah.\n\n78\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.670\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it happen\nwhere somebody has said,\n\n79\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.110\nhere configure IP\naddresses on these devices.\n\n80\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.697\nSo I hand him a stack of 3550s and the guy\nlooks at me and goes, wait a minute,\n\n81\n00:04:31.697 --> 00:04:35.617\nI know Cisco, but how do you configure\nan IP address on that device?\n\n82\n00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:38.910\nAnd that's when I know they have\nreally gotten this confused.\n\n83\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because they go,\n\n84\n00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.660\nI can't configure an IP\naddress on an interface,\n\n85\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.050\nI'm like make sure you\nuse a virtual interface.\n\n86\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.748\nAnd then all of a sudden\ntheir mind is like-\n\n87\n00:04:45.748 --> 00:04:46.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, what does that mean?\n\n89\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.860\nAnd I say, interface VLAN 1,\nand they go, yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.910\nThat apparently,\nthat's what I should have said.\n\n91\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.900\nSo yes, I should be that specific but\nin the industry, right?\n\n92\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.778\nPeople know how to do and they just expect\nthat you know how to do it as well.\n\n93\n00:05:01.778 --> 00:05:06.170\nAnd Cisco, yeah, they just expect\nthat if you can do it, you can do it.\n\n94\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.384\nSo that's pretty much the key.\n\n95\n00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:10.638\nSo it's gonna be 19216816 and\n\n96\n00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:16.470\nwe have this one as set as .3 here\nwith the /25 which means 128.\n\n97\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.540\nNow it's always good that\nif you're doing this and\n\n98\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.100\nyou've built out your own diagram in lab,\nalways write it down in cider if you can,\n\n99\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.500\nand then type it out in the long format.\n\n100\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.350\nWhich you'll have to do in most of\nthe Cisco devices, not every time but\n\n101\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.820\nsome of the newer ones will allow\nyou to do the slash notation,\n\n102\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.400\nbut Is not always gonna be true.\n\n103\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.278\nSo make sure you set that up.\n\n104\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.871\nRemember that only on Cisco switches,\n\n105\n00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:46.145\nthe virtual interfaces\nare normally shutdown by default.\n\n106\n00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.242\nThat will mean on every\nswitch it will be but\n\n107\n00:05:48.242 --> 00:05:51.584\nI always like the issue no shutdown\nanyway, it's just good habit.\n\n108\n00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.838\nAnd you're gonna be putting\nan IP address on it.\n\n109\n00:05:53.838 --> 00:05:55.288\nYou're gonna be using it,\n\n110\n00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:59.480\nmake sure you issue a no shutdown\nif you're going to do this as well.\n\n111\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.728\nNow we're gonna issue one more\nIP address on the device,\n\n112\n00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:07.543\nwhich is gonna be this\nNYACCESS switch two, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:10.716\nNow this NYACCESS switch, hopefully\nI've gotten it there, there we go.\n\n114\n00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:13.980\nOkay, we've used this\nbefore in a previous lab.\n\n115\n00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:18.237\nAnd this is also going to help us out.\n\n116\n00:06:18.237 --> 00:06:23.410\nSo I'm gonna do,\nfrom this point I'm in project.mode,\n\n117\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:30.710\nwhich means configure terminal, and\nthen I need to configure interface VLAN 1.\n\n118\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.890\nThen IP address 192.168.16.4\n\n119\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.070\nwith the proper subnet mask as well, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.945\nMake sure we get all of that set up in\nthe way that we actually need it to to\n\n121\n00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:48.980\nwork and do what we need to okay?\n\n122\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.969\nSo now we have IP addresses on two devices\ninside of one of those networks, right?\n\n123\n00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:59.789\nThat 192168 0 16.0 network with a /25,\n\n124\n00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.200\nnow we have two devices\nwithin that network.\n\n125\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.870\nAnd at this point, once we have something\nlike that, okay, we can now turn and\n\n126\n00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.400\nsee just a couple of other things here,\nokay.\n\n127\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.520\nOne of the problems that happens are the\nway that these IP addresses are set up,\n\n128\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.420\nand once you get that end, everything\nis set up the way that you think it is,\n\n129\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.650\nyou can now go to your\nend user device here.\n\n130\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.550\nAnd this one,\n\n131\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.436\nI'm just gonna bring up the command prompt\nto at least I hope help us out here.\n\n132\n00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:36.706\nLet's change the font size so that you\ncan see just a little bit better and\n\n133\n00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:40.030\nthe color size, once again, color, gray.\n\n134\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.040\nWhy the heck would you default to\na gray text on a black background?\n\n135\n00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.095\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was better than black\ntext on a black background.\n\n136\n00:07:47.095 --> 00:07:48.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it reminds me\n\n137\n00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:49.240\nof the Macbook Pro, right?\n\n138\n00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.422\nThe lettering on the back side of\nthat thing is silver, it's aluminum,\n\n139\n00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:54.416\nright, and\nthen they put it in gray letters.\n\n140\n00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:58.935\nAnd you're like, okay, sure, that makes-\n&gt;&gt; Are they trying to camouflage this?\n\n141\n00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:00.139\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something is weird.\n\n142\n00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:01.833\nIt's great cuz that's the serial\nnumber on the device.\n\n143\n00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:05.695\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny, do they not\nrealize when you camouflage something,\n\n144\n00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:08.561\nyou typically use the colors\nof the surrounding area so\n\n145\n00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:10.260\nyou that you can't see it.\n\n146\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.415\nJust my little rant.\n\n147\n00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:13.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I understand,\n\n148\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.990\nI would do the same thing too.\n\n149\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.390\nSo here it is, Daniel, I went ahead and\nI typed in ipconfig so\n\n150\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.250\nthat we can see this configuration.\n\n151\n00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.953\nNow one of these, make sure you don't\nchange this because this is what connects\n\n152\n00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:27.550\nit to their actual machine so\nthat they can get access and\n\n153\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.590\nyou can get access to some of\nthe files that you need to.\n\n154\n00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.260\nSo if you're gonna play around with\nany of them, it's gonna be this one,\n\n155\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.010\nthis Lab_Nic here, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.460\nNow Daniel,\nif you notice something that's different,\n\n157\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.190\nthat may actually connect,\nthat may not, so this may be one\n\n158\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.540\nof the initial trouble shooting things\nthat we have to think about here.\n\n159\n00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.350\nDo you see anything strange compared\nto what we've been configuring on\n\n160\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.100\nthose interfaces?\n\n161\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.470\n&gt;&gt; That subnet mask might\ngive you a bit of an issue.\n\n162\n00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.010\n&gt;&gt; It sure looks like it would, right?\n\n163\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.870\nSo somebody goes, wait a minute,\nthat looks right.\n\n164\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.642\nBut everything that we've been\nconfiguring has been that /25,\n\n165\n00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:06.030\nwhich the subnet mask is 255,\n255, 255, 128, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:11.650\nAnd so this though, and look but wait\na minute, it's still in the same range,\n\n167\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.590\nthat should work, right?\n\n168\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.360\nIt's not going to work very easily\nif it were actually connected\n\n169\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.110\nto the right thing.\n\n170\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:23.898\nSo let's see if we can make something like\nthat happen here, a little bit easier.\n\n171\n00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:26.188\nI've gotta zoom out here.\n\n172\n00:09:26.188 --> 00:09:30.282\nI hate having to do this,\ncuz it never turns out the way,\n\n173\n00:09:30.282 --> 00:09:35.000\nas far as the sizes go,\nthe way that we want them to be.\n\n174\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.780\nSee if I can collapse this down a little\nbit and pull that up, there we go.\n\n175\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.190\nOf course, it's not gonna do it.\n\n176\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.910\n&gt;&gt; No, of course.\n[LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Why would it actually play along?\n\n178\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.410\n&gt;&gt; That's just crazy talk, Ronnie.\n\n179\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.360\n&gt;&gt; I know, I just hate that cuz\nnow it means that I have to\n\n180\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.520\nis change that font size\njust one more time.\n\n181\n00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.606\nYou would think a 24-point\nfont would be plenty big for\n\n182\n00:09:57.606 --> 00:10:01.448\nmost people, but not for\nus, okay, but there we go.\n\n183\n00:10:01.448 --> 00:10:06.369\nSo at this point,\nlet's go ahead and ping 192.168,\n\n184\n00:10:06.369 --> 00:10:11.203\nand I know I did a 16.3,\nand, look at that, Daniel.\n\n185\n00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it opening.\n&gt;&gt; It's actually working, and\n\n186\n00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.476\nthat's because we're actually starting\nfinding out something that we didn't\n\n187\n00:10:16.476 --> 00:10:18.010\nknow about at this point.\n\n188\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.859\nThat somewhere there is another interface\nthat's connected into that NYACCCESS\n\n189\n00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:22.484\nswitch.\n\n190\n00:10:22.484 --> 00:10:26.950\nSo it's actually us to do a couple of\ndifferent things here in the background.\n\n191\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.902\nAll right Daniel,\nnow this thing just pinged and\n\n192\n00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:32.720\nI don't believe that it should have,\nright?\n\n193\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.051\n&gt;&gt; Because they all subnet mask.\n\n194\n00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:35.825\n&gt;&gt; Right, the whole subnet\nmask that we're talking about.\n\n195\n00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:41.715\nThis is /24 and then the other one\nis actually a /25 on the NYACCESS or\n\n196\n00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:45.770\nthe NYCORE which of one\nof the IP address on.\n\n197\n00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.550\nSo that's what shouldn't be happening.\n\n198\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.740\nBut as I'm talking about this and as I've\nthought about it here just for a moment, I\n\n199\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.040\nrealize something that what I did here is\nsomething I probably should not have done.\n\n200\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.870\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, which is I tried to ping from\n\n201\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.370\nthe where this IP address\non this computer, right,\n\n202\n00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.648\nis a /24 and\nthat's kind of the bigger network.\n\n203\n00:11:04.648 --> 00:11:08.091\nOkay, that /24 is larger than the /25,\n\n204\n00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:13.130\n/24 gives me 256 addresses,\n/25 gives me 128, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.440\nNow what that means is that if\nwe do some binary endings, so\n\n206\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.990\nI went ahead and wrote this out so\nthat we can see it.\n\n207\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.592\nSo here, for example,\nis the IP address for that computer.\n\n208\n00:11:23.592 --> 00:11:27.097\nAnd if we then take a look and\ndo the binary ending,\n\n209\n00:11:27.097 --> 00:11:33.202\nnotice that this puts me in that action\noctet as being that .0, so 16.0 network.\n\n210\n00:11:33.202 --> 00:11:39.297\nRemember that /25 when we did the subnet,\nin the variable in subnetting,\n\n211\n00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:46.100\nwe also put 192.168.16.4/25\nalso in the .0 network as well.\n\n212\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.060\nAnd if I do a binary ending right here,\nokay, and you see\n\n213\n00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.450\nwhere I have taken that first bit out\nin associated with the network portion,\n\n214\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:01.210\nyou will then see that this is also\npart of that, 0.0 network as well.\n\n215\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.870\nAll zeros going across here, so\n\n216\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.610\nthis is where those overlapping\nranges are really dangerous, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.965\nWhen we talk about the use of\nvariable length subnet masking and\n\n218\n00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:15.100\nRonnie said, you don't wanna overlap\nthese because that can cause some issues.\n\n219\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.790\nThis is one of those issues, where now,\nI've essentially said, go ahead and\n\n220\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.230\nmake a smaller network here, but\n\n221\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.760\noverlap it with a bigger network\nthat's already out there.\n\n222\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.330\nSo in theory, the way that we fix this is\nwe should change the IP address here or\n\n223\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.920\nthe subnet mask here.\n\n224\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.440\nAnd that way,\nit won't do something like this, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.535\nSo if you were instead, we were to start\nat the next network which we created\n\n226\n00:12:39.535 --> 00:12:43.631\nthe /25, well notice that puts me\non the 120.8 network instead and\n\n227\n00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:45.860\nyou can see the ending at the end of this.\n\n228\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.380\nAnd then even on that\nthird network we created,\n\n229\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.620\nwhere it actually does the 192 network,\nyou can see where the results.\n\n230\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.820\nDid I do too many 0s here, didn't I?\n\n231\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.030\nOkay, where the [LAUGH] where that last\nresult is actually going to be that, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:05.023\nBut that's what's happened is that I ended\nup pinging from a smaller network that was\n\n233\n00:13:05.023 --> 00:13:09.687\nready in this larger network in this sense\nwithin that same range very quickly.\n\n234\n00:13:09.687 --> 00:13:14.580\nBut remember that the second network that\nwe created actually was outside of that.\n\n235\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.784\nSo if we would've ping let's\nsay like 192.168.1.129,\n\n236\n00:13:19.784 --> 00:13:23.697\nit would not have actually\nworked in that way, okay.\n\n237\n00:13:23.697 --> 00:13:24.401\nSo this way,\n\n238\n00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:28.376\nwe would actually be on a different\nnetwork compared to this one instead.\n\n239\n00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:33.290\nThat's really kind of the end here is\nthat we'll see that's why this idea of\n\n240\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:38.060\nsubnetting, it can be a little confusing,\ncuz you can if you overlap those ranges\n\n241\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.400\nwhen you're doing variable link subnet\nmasking, weird things will happen and\n\n242\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.100\nthis is one of them.\n\n243\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.090\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty weird.\n[LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.040\n&gt;&gt; It is weird and\n\n245\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.180\nit does go against everything\nthat we've done, but\n\n246\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.520\nhere's the math to show you it\ndid actually work that way.\n\n247\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.883\nSo Daniel, that's gonna be us for\nat least the configuration,\n\n248\n00:13:51.883 --> 00:13:53.561\nwe did just a little\nbit of troubleshooting.\n\n249\n00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.953\nYou see the trouble that it led us to but\nnow we need to verify that\n\n250\n00:13:56.953 --> 00:13:59.970\nthe other connectivities that\nwe have is gonna be good.\n\n251\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.040\nAnd then we'll trouble shoot some\n\n252\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.290\nother issues that are very\ncommon inside networks.\n\n253\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:08.310\nThis is not as common because people\ntend to use the subnet calculators.\n\n254\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.820\nBut if you're doing it in your head and\n\n255\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.990\nyou start doing things like this,\nit can happen very quickly.\n\n256\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.861\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've gotta look out for those\nthings, because like Ronnie has said,\n\n257\n00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:17.089\nthey do crop up from time to time.\n\n258\n00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:20.950\nGotta make sure all the Ts are crossed and\nall the lowercase js are dotted,\n\n259\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.266\nI know that's strange.\n\n260\n00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:23.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.420\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.090\nwe're back with more in our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.410\nAnd joining us as always our good friend,\na one Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.130\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.370\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Daniel,\n\n11\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.670\nas we continue on to take a look at more,\nof course, on our CCENT series.\n\n12\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.100\nGetting ready for that CCENT exam, we\nare now, of course in the midst of a lab.\n\n13\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.190\nAnd this is a part three, so\nwe've seen some configuration.\n\n14\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.490\nWe've also done some you've seen it all,\nhere and there,\n\n15\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.520\nespecially as I've messed up a couple of\ntimes, but we still need to continue on.\n\n16\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.480\nWe've got IP addresses which\nI'm not gonna be able to say,\n\n17\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.060\nIP version four addresses configured\non the interfaces that we need.\n\n18\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.823\nAnd I've also went ahead now\nthat this is a part three,\n\n19\n00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:01.909\nI've kind of cleaned up the lab diagram I\nwas building that I was going along, but\n\n20\n00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.820\nlet's take a look at my diagram here and\nthis will setup.\n\n21\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.655\nThe topology that we're gonna be using.\n\n22\n00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:11.190\nSo right here on my machine\nwe'll take a look at that, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.290\nSo here it is.\n\n24\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.250\nHere's where the full layout comes in and\nthis is how the topology is built.\n\n25\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.220\nNow, this is something that you do want\nto try and do on your own as well.\n\n26\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.890\nDon't just take my example, but\nas you start to come up with IP\n\n27\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.930\naddressing schemes and you realize\nthat there's gonna be these networks.\n\n28\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.190\nTry and come up with your topology about\nwhere things are going to end up being and\n\n29\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.850\nhow they lay out.\n\n30\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.810\nEven though the overall lab as you\nstart with your practice labs.com labs,\n\n31\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.200\nit is more complex than this.\n\n32\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.040\nWhittling it down, okay, and\n\n33\n00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.650\njust putting the most specific elements\nthat you and I are going to work with,\n\n34\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.270\nit helps you logically to think about\nhow these things go into place.\n\n35\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.510\nAnd that's an important concept and it's\nactually easier once you do this, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.250\nSo the three routers that we\nhave inside of that, right?\n\n37\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.910\nThere's one called ISP,\nthat we really don't configure at all.\n\n38\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.570\nThere, of course, is NYEDGE and\nthis one has two IP addresses on it, and\n\n39\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.200\nthis one is also connected\nto one called NYWAN.\n\n40\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.820\nSo we've configured the IP address right\nhere on the interface IPWAN gig0/0 and\n\n41\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.860\nthen on NYEDGE we've also configured\nthe interface facing that one.\n\n42\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.830\nAnd then on the NYEDGE we've also\nconfigured it facing the ISP, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.950\nSo in between, which is the only network\nthat we're normally responsible for,\n\n44\n00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.630\nI kind of drew it off to the lower\nleft hand quadrant of our screen here.\n\n45\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.690\nThese were also IP addresses too.\n\n46\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.200\nSo one of the ones that we ran\nacross is the test machine,\n\n47\n00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.240\nthe verification machine that we have.\n\n48\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.350\nAnd this one is on\na completely different subnet\n\n49\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.730\nthan the other two machines\nhere that we have.\n\n50\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.330\nWe saw at the end of the previous episode,\nif you were following along,\n\n51\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.730\nthat even though we suspected\nthat this would not work,\n\n52\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.180\nbeing out of ping from this 16.10 machine.\n\n53\n00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.900\nAll the way up to 192.168.16.1 or\n\n54\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.080\neven these other two machines\nbe called the subnet mask.\n\n55\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.158\nWe showed you it could be done.\n\n56\n00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:17.651\nAnd the reason why is that\nthat subnet mask right here,\n\n57\n00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:23.940\nit also encompasses the entire subnet\nthat's actually here in the /25.\n\n58\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.120\nSo it can be done and\n\n59\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.210\nif you do the binary ending,\nyou'll see it's exactly right, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.610\nSo it is strange and at the beginning\nyou don't expect it to be that way.\n\n61\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.560\nYou just assume it's different subnets and\nit's not going to work.\n\n62\n00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.900\nBut right now, that's what we have, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.431\nSo one of the next things right,\nis that once you configure your devices.\n\n64\n00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.822\nYou wanna begin with the verification\nprocess that you have configured those IP\n\n65\n00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.480\naddresses correctly.\n\n66\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.170\nSo now, at least I think I am, I'm\ngoing to switch to our lab environment.\n\n67\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.560\nAnd this is at practicelabs.com so\ndon't forget\n\n68\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.830\nyou have access to this as well as the lab\nguide that you can follow along here.\n\n69\n00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.630\nAnd you can print it out, but\nit is a ton of pages if you choose to.\n\n70\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.310\nBut the guide is over here on the left\nhand side and I didn't show this Daniel,\n\n71\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.010\ncuz I was trying to not make\nthe screen look gigantic here.\n\n72\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.032\nBut it does actually walk you\nthrough the lab guide and\n\n73\n00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:21.130\nhere is the actual topology, but\nwe are actually kind of working between\n\n74\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.040\nthis router here which is really tiny and\nthis one.\n\n75\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.070\nAnd we are just kind of feeding\nthe information on those.\n\n76\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.350\nThat's all they are really\ndoing at this point.\n\n77\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.860\nBut as you go through, it will give\nyou step by steps on how to do this.\n\n78\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.506\nAnd of course,\n\n79\n00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:37.050\neven more detailed explanation than one\nI'm providing right here during the show.\n\n80\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.523\nBut I'm doing it kind\nof my style is what's\n\n81\n00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:40.707\nhappening here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n82\n00:04:40.707 --> 00:04:42.427\n&gt;&gt; So we're just trying to make sure that\n\n83\n00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:43.061\nyou do-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n84\n00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:43.855\n&gt;&gt; To a point, right?\n\n85\n00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:45.630\n&gt;&gt; It's more of an art than a science.\n\n86\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would call it more of\n\n87\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.139\na fumbling through.\n&gt;&gt; Falling down the stairs and-\n\n88\n00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:49.765\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n89\n00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, falling down the stairs.\n\n90\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.812\nAnd usually landing on my feet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:54.852\n&gt;&gt; After being bumped and bruised a lot,\n\n92\n00:04:54.852 --> 00:04:56.850\nbut you'll get there, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.440\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n94\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.770\nSo one of the things right, is to make\nsure that you have good connectivity.\n\n95\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.790\nOnce you get your IP addresses\nconfigured correctly,\n\n96\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.560\nyou wanna verify by pinging\nthe devices that you have configured.\n\n97\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.150\nSo you start off with one device.\n\n98\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.580\nIt doesn't matter which one.\n\n99\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.400\nI like starting off with\nthe most centrally located one,\n\n100\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.770\nis the one that I like.\n\n101\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.780\nAnd the reason why is, because I know from\nthat machine I can ping multiple devices,\n\n102\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.040\ninstead of me going, well, if I start\nover here on the left hand side,\n\n103\n00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.610\nI can ping one.\n\n104\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.510\nAnd then for me to ping another device,\nI have to go to the second one.\n\n105\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.180\nThen, I can ping the next device.\n\n106\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.470\nBut if I start off with\nthe most centrally located one,\n\n107\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.720\njust like I'm showing right here.\n\n108\n00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:37.380\nRight, which is NYEDGE, I can ping NYWAN.\n\n109\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.550\nI can also ping the ISP over here,\nat least on this particular interface.\n\n110\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.150\nI can't ping this one yet, because I have\nit grayed out a little bit because they\n\n111\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.271\npreconfigured this for us, but\nI don't really know what the address is\n\n112\n00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:57.071\nover on this side, I'm just giving\nyou a fake address right now.\n\n113\n00:05:57.071 --> 00:05:58.680\nBut it just gives us that ability, right?\n\n114\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.060\nSo that's all we're doing at this\npoint is we're verifying that\n\n115\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.390\nthe IP addresses actually\nare gonna be valid here.\n\n116\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.930\nSo once we get here we're\ngoing to go to enable,\n\n117\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.040\nget inside of our privileged exec mode.\n\n118\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.450\nFrom there I begin to ping,\n192.168.16.2 and\n\n119\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.300\nthis should be to NYWAN interface.\n\n120\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.808\nAnd notice it automatically goes ahead and\nsays, all right,\n\n121\n00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:28.719\nwe are up and we are ready to go so\nthat's actually a good one there, so\n\n122\n00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.380\nthat 16.2 that is going to be that.\n\n123\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.790\nNow another thing usually\nthe idea of pinging of course,\n\n124\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.470\nis that you might also ping\nyour own IP address, verifying\n\n125\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.580\nthat that is also able to send and\nreceive information, even from yourself.\n\n126\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.880\nIt seems like a strange thing.\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n127\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.950\n&gt;&gt; But you're just testing your\n\n128\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.790\nown interface.\n\n129\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.050\nAnd that's all you're doing,\nis you're verifying that hey,\n\n130\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.820\nI am actually able to send something and\nis it responding back.\n\n131\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.180\nNow I'm actually going, when I go to 16.2,\nI'm saying the other device is what\n\n132\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.290\nis able to receive information and\nable to transmit back as well.\n\n133\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.840\nNow, this is different than what\nwe normally see in a regular\n\n134\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.480\ndesktop environment as far\nas replies to pings, right?\n\n135\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.880\nSo normally when we did something like\nthis with our computers as well, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.883\nSo like right here,\nI'm gonna do something and\n\n137\n00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:23.453\nremember I told you that this should\nactually, 192.168 16.3 here, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:26.090\nThis is normally what\nthe replies end up looking like.\n\n139\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.770\nSo if you're actually used to that just\nfine, well that is now kinda truncated\n\n140\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.180\ninto, well, a single exclamation point.\n\n141\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.820\nNow, let me go ahead and\nzoom in just a little bit more.\n\n142\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.360\nI'll have to kinda readjust our\nzoom here in just a moment, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.460\nYou'll usually have two options here,\nnow there's more than this, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.539\nBut at least at this point,\nyou'll have two options for\n\n145\n00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:50.184\npings at the very beginning.\n\n146\n00:07:50.184 --> 00:07:53.620\nYou'll either see this or\nyou'll see periods, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.049\nThis actually means success and\nthat's what you're also seeing is.\n\n148\n00:07:57.049 --> 00:07:59.997\nThe word success rate is\nwhat you're seeing here and\n\n149\n00:07:59.997 --> 00:08:02.360\nyou're actually able to do that.\n\n150\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.453\nThe other possibility,\nthough, and let's try and\n\n151\n00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:13.485\ndo this here, let's ping 192.168.16.193.\n\n152\n00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:20.260\nAnd now notice, Daniel,\nit slowed down from what, look at that.\n\n153\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.904\nI'm getting, this is not a good sign.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:24.190\n&gt;&gt; Overall, so-\n\n155\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.529\n&gt;&gt; Those aren't exclamation points\n\n156\n00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:27.634\nI've noticed.\n&gt;&gt; They are not exclamation points.\n\n157\n00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:31.949\nSo this begins to lead me to realize\nmaybe somewhere along the line,\n\n158\n00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:35.970\nI may not have configured\nsomething correctly, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.125\nSo when I start taking a look\nat those addresses and\n\n160\n00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:40.025\nstart beginning the verification, okay,\n\n161\n00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:42.866\nyou'll end up seeing like the very\nfirst time you normally ping.\n\n162\n00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:46.360\nSo you'll end up seeing you\nmay drop one period, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.628\nIn other words, you'll get a single\nperiod, sometimes maybe two, but usually,\n\n164\n00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:50.292\nit's only one.\n\n165\n00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:55.148\nAnd that's because there's a process it's\ndoing, one that has it going called ARP,\n\n166\n00:08:55.148 --> 00:08:59.093\nAddress Resolution Protocol,\nbecause I pinged a protocol address.\n\n167\n00:08:59.093 --> 00:09:03.430\nRemember that that's a IP address,\nand that means the other side\n\n168\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.060\nhas to be able to take that\nparticular IP address and\n\n169\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.970\nthen translate it into\na layer two address.\n\n170\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.311\nRemember this is layer three that's\ntranslated into layer two so\n\n171\n00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:16.385\nthen it can actually reply back as well.\n\n172\n00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:20.264\nSo that's what's going on when it's\ndropping is doing something that we call\n\n173\n00:09:20.264 --> 00:09:22.010\naddress resolution.\n\n174\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.390\nBut once that happens, then the rest\nof them should be successful.\n\n175\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.710\nBut now, I can go ahead and say, hey,\nlook, that first one goes for ARP.\n\n176\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.598\nBut the other ones that aren't\nreplying lets me know something,\n\n177\n00:09:32.598 --> 00:09:34.603\nthat, hey, the other side is not replying.\n\n178\n00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:40.790\nAnd it could be that it's not\nreplying because of several reasons.\n\n179\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.484\nOne, Daniel, is that when I configured it,\n\n180\n00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:44.413\nI might have configured\nthe IP address correctly.\n\n181\n00:09:44.413 --> 00:09:47.410\nBut what if I didn't turn\nthe interface on, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.350\n&gt;&gt; That would be a problem.\n\n183\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that means that\n\n184\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.210\nthe interface is down.\n\n185\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.336\nSo should it actually respond?\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't do anything.\n\n186\n00:09:52.336 --> 00:09:52.945\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't do\n\n187\n00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:53.684\nanything, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's off.\n\n188\n00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:54.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n189\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.395\nit shouldn't do anything cuz it's off,\nbut it's very easy, right?\n\n190\n00:09:57.395 --> 00:09:59.260\nCuz the issue is just really,\n\n191\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.798\nwhat, the word no shutdown.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n192\n00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:02.289\n&gt;&gt; And even if I've typed it in three or\n\n193\n00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:04.677\nfour times, if I got distracted\nduring that last time and\n\n194\n00:10:04.677 --> 00:10:05.788\nI just forgot to issue it.\n\n195\n00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:08.830\nNow I just press on it, there we go,\nthe IP address is on it.\n\n196\n00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.807\nVery easily done at this point,\n\n197\n00:10:10.807 --> 00:10:15.360\nwhere we might find out that we are not\nable to ping exactly what we need to.\n\n198\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.835\nSo right now, in terms of just\nconnectivity, I've got a 50%, right?\n\n199\n00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.425\nI could ping one side, but\n\n200\n00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:24.440\nI can't ping the other side in\nterms of the addresses here.\n\n201\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.068\nSo we can now begin that process of\njust investigation a little bit.\n\n202\n00:10:28.068 --> 00:10:31.390\nCuz normally,\nwhen IP address is on routers,\n\n203\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.220\nthere is gonna be one of two things\nthat normally happens, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.070\nThe first one is, Ronnie, you just messed\nup whatever the IP address was, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.930\nAnd with me, it's very possible.\n\n206\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.675\nAnd I've seen this happen,\nand even on exams, right?\n\n207\n00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:47.261\nThe difference between looking at 192.168,\n\n208\n00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:51.650\nwhen you look at it all the time,\nthat becomes like blinders.\n\n209\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.307\nIt's like highlighting something.\n&gt;&gt; No matter what it is,\n\n210\n00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:58.927\nyou see 192.168 as long as it's close.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as long as it's close.\n\n211\n00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:04.520\nAnd I've seen this where it's 192.169, and\nthen I was like, why is this not working?\n\n212\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.454\nAnd I keep staring at it.\n\n213\n00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:08.060\nAs I'm looking at it, I'm like,\nwhy is this not working?\n\n214\n00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.495\nAnd it was just, again,\nfat-fingering simply one character over.\n\n215\n00:11:11.495 --> 00:11:15.857\nAnd then I just keep looking and\nI keep looking, and finally, I'd go, and\n\n216\n00:11:15.857 --> 00:11:18.340\nI just start staring at each number.\n\n217\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.800\nAnd I'm like, all right, now, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.068\nBecause we're so used to doing 192.168,\nyou just forget to actually look at\n\n219\n00:11:24.068 --> 00:11:25.626\nevery single one.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n220\n00:11:25.626 --> 00:11:28.730\nI've actually done this exact thing,\nand Ronnie came.\n\n221\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.260\nI said, Ronnie take a look at this.\n\n222\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.220\nThis is not pinging.\n\n223\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.540\nI have no idea why this is.\n\n224\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.658\nEverything should be fine.\n\n225\n00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:34.550\nIt's not working.\n\n226\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.751\nHe was like, yeah,\n\n227\n00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:37.611\nyour subnet mask is wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n228\n00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:40.158\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got 251 instead of 252.\n\n229\n00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:43.050\nAnd I'm like, that's horrible.\n\n230\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.683\nIt's just my-\n&gt;&gt; It's just easy, yeah.\n\n231\n00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:47.450\n&gt;&gt; My eyes just told me that's a 252.\n\n232\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.619\nBut when a fresh set of eyes came over and\nsaw it, it wasn't looking for\n\n233\n00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:53.385\nanything other than mistakes,\nhe saw the issue right away.\n\n234\n00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:55.856\nAnd it's really easy to do.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n235\n00:11:55.856 --> 00:11:58.210\nthis is where there's that push for\n\n236\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:03.006\nslow down until you know that every\nletter that you type in is correctly.\n\n237\n00:12:03.006 --> 00:12:06.495\nBut then you gotta work on that speed and\nbuild that muscle memory,\n\n238\n00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:10.858\nthat if your finger happens to reach over\njust one character different that you feel\n\n239\n00:12:10.858 --> 00:12:11.504\nit, okay?\n\n240\n00:12:11.504 --> 00:12:14.172\nNow, I don't say that\nyou have to do that for\n\n241\n00:12:14.172 --> 00:12:18.861\neverything, but when it comes down to\nneeding to account for speed such as for\n\n242\n00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:22.540\nthe exam, that is how often\nyou want to do this, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.545\nIt really is.\n\n244\n00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:26.496\nIt's the same thing like if\nyou're playing first base, right,\n\n245\n00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.715\nevery other baseman knows that if you\nhave a chance to put somebody out,\n\n246\n00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:31.965\nfirst base is the way that you go, period.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n247\n00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:33.239\n&gt;&gt; So you don't go,\n\n248\n00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:36.100\ndo I need to decide between second or\nthird?\n\n249\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.220\nIf there's a chance at first,\nyou wanna put the guy out at first.\n\n250\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.166\nAnd that's what you wanna do is\nyou wanna feel that muscle memory,\n\n251\n00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.754\nmake sure that it's there, okay?\n\n252\n00:12:42.754 --> 00:12:45.989\nSo Daniel, we're gonna stop right here in\nterms of the pings because I know that I'm\n\n253\n00:12:45.989 --> 00:12:47.290\nnow having an issue.\n\n254\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.310\nNow in theory, right you would go to NYWAN\nand you'd ping again the same things.\n\n255\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.048\nYou'd go to every other place.\n\n256\n00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:57.109\nAnd what you might find out is that even\non NYWAN that this address is still not\n\n257\n00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.230\nresponding.\n\n258\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.540\nSo that should also help you\nto isolate which device is on.\n\n259\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.154\nSo if we were to do that,\nthat should do the same thing.\n\n260\n00:13:03.154 --> 00:13:06.025\nBut I'm pretty sure that I\nknow cuz that IP address,\n\n261\n00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:08.190\nI know cuz I'm the one that typed it in.\n\n262\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.300\nBut overall, though, we need to\ntroubleshoot that right now, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.160\nSo we said that the IP address\nis the other thing, okay?\n\n264\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.700\nThe second one, though,\nis the configuration on that interface.\n\n265\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.590\nSo like I said, shutdown or\nno shutdown is a very big possibility\n\n266\n00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:26.550\nthat I went ahead and I didn't\nactually even issue a no shutdown.\n\n267\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.250\nThe other one, though,\nthat I've done, Daniel,\n\n268\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.500\nis I've actually even just configured the\nwrong interface on that device as well.\n\n269\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.566\nSo I thought, on all those devices,\n\n270\n00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:39.766\nI had it in my mind exactly which one\nI was configuring, and I just thought,\n\n271\n00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:43.724\nonce again, I'm like, okay,\ninterface gigabit ethernet 0/1.\n\n272\n00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:47.410\nAnd then all of a sudden,\nI type it in and it's just 0/2.\n\n273\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.670\nType in the right IP address, but\n\n274\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.570\nit was even on the wrong\ninterface at that point, okay?\n\n275\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.890\nSo usually, it's the misconfiguration\nof the interface, and\n\n276\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.630\nnot the misconfiguration\nof the IP address that\n\n277\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.640\nwe're normally having to look at, okay?\n\n278\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.360\nSo let's take a look at the main tool\nthat will help us out here, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.542\nNow in Cisco LAN, there's two things, and\nthe problem is one of them is like go and\n\n280\n00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:12.880\ncry to your mom and she'll fix everything,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.925\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and I mean that, yeah.\n\n282\n00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:15.643\nI hate to say that.\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n283\n00:14:15.643 --> 00:14:17.683\n&gt;&gt; It is, and I hate to say this,\n\n284\n00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:23.470\nas much as I depend on it in real life,\nyou can't depend on it on the exam, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.541\nSo let me show you that one first, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Is it the Cisco TAC number?\n\n286\n00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:28.631\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it pretty much is that, yeah.\n\n287\n00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:31.720\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat is probably number one, right?\n\n288\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.592\n&gt;&gt; That is definitely crying to your mom.\n\n289\n00:14:34.592 --> 00:14:36.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is, okay?\n\n290\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:41.183\nBut the command that we normally end up\nrunning to, okay, show running-config.\n\n291\n00:14:41.183 --> 00:14:46.137\nAnd the reason why is it shows\nevery single configuration that\n\n292\n00:14:46.137 --> 00:14:49.780\nis active on that router right there,\nokay?\n\n293\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.786\nSo every line of this actually shows\nus what we might be looking at.\n\n294\n00:14:53.786 --> 00:14:58.150\nSo I can just go ahead and use this,\nand that means I can go ahead and\n\n295\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.720\ntake a look at some of\nthe information here.\n\n296\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.750\nAnd I'll start seeing some\nof the stuff here and\n\n297\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.183\nsee what is happening as well, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:07.734\nSo when I take a look,\n\n299\n00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:13.640\nit looks like everything is configured\ncorrectly on those interfaces here.\n\n300\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.261\nSo did I actually do the right thing?\n\n301\n00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:17.418\nLet me check on something before.\n\n302\n00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:20.120\nEvery once in a while,\ndepending on the size here.\n\n303\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.190\nNow let me verify.\n\n304\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.230\nLook at that, Daniel.\n\n305\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.054\nI was even typing in what?\n\n306\n00:15:24.054 --> 00:15:28.000\nThe wrong IP address that\nI wasn't even thinking.\n\n307\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.830\nSo once again, that might be actually\nthe issue that I was having is\n\n308\n00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.210\nthat it wasn't even close to the right IP\naddress here that I was thinking about\n\n309\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.776\nthat I was going to connect to, but\nit was actually even the wrong IP address.\n\n310\n00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:43.208\nNow the reason why that matters, right,\n\n311\n00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:47.462\nis because we've already done\nsomething here during our time, right?\n\n312\n00:15:47.462 --> 00:15:51.890\nI ping from here,\nwhich is this edge, over to 2.\n\n313\n00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.639\nWhat I was actually wanting\nto do was to ping this side.\n\n314\n00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.260\nOkay?\n\n315\n00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.706\nIt's what I was wanting to do.\n\n316\n00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:00.330\nAnd Daniel,\nI just even misconfigured what,\n\n317\n00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.280\nthe IP address that was\non that side at all.\n\n318\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.600\nSo that's why a topology\nlike this helps you.\n\n319\n00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.970\nYou can go back now and go, wait a minute,\n\n320\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.995\nwas that the right IP address that\nI should have configured over here?\n\n321\n00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:15.330\nOr was it not the right IP\naddress I should have configured?\n\n322\n00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.000\nSo when I do something like this,\nit actually just points out, Ronnie,\n\n323\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.020\nyou just misconfigured this totally.\n&gt;&gt; And this is, again,\n\n324\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.260\nwhy we do documentation,\nwhy you draw network diagrams and\n\n325\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.420\nyou document them properly, so\nthat if you're ever unsure,\n\n326\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.280\nand even when you go to the exam,\nyou've got that whiteboard.\n\n327\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.560\nScratch out some real quick and\ndirty network diagrams,\n\n328\n00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.450\ncuz it will help you a lot to visualize\nwhat the network should look like.\n\n329\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.830\nSo as you configure, you know exactly, you\ncan cross them off, I've done that one,\n\n330\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.300\nI've done that one, I've done that one,\nI've done that one.\n\n331\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.370\nAnd everything's ready to go.\n\n332\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.810\nIt doesn't take much time away from you,\nand\n\n333\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.810\nit can be a really big help.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n334\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.670\nNow Daniel, I'm glad you brought that\npoint up because there's also something\n\n335\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.550\nelse that can save you a little bit of\ntime if you have to draw up the diagram.\n\n336\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:03.120\nYou don't have to write\nout the entire IP address.\n\n337\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.970\nAll you have to do is make sure\nthat you get enough of it.\n\n338\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.300\nSo for me, in reality,\nif I was doing this on a sheet of paper,\n\n339\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.530\nI know what my network number\npretty much is going to be.\n\n340\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.408\nSo I might go ahead and\njust do this part is what I would do, and\n\n341\n00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.378\njust put that down.\n\n342\n00:17:15.378 --> 00:17:18.660\n16.1, because that makes\nsense to me logically.\n\n343\n00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.750\nBut I know that that's gonna be enough for\nme to identify,\n\n344\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.480\ncuz I know what parts I need.\n\n345\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.530\nSo once I get that down,\nthen I'm fine and I'm good.\n\n346\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.370\nSo Daniel,\nit looks like we have actually identified,\n\n347\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.500\nat least Daniel has\nidentified my issue here.\n\n348\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.260\nSo that first,\nlet me see if I can get that changed here.\n\n349\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.220\nThere we go, takes me a little bit\nof time to switch on over here.\n\n350\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:39.730\nSo now,\n\n351\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.890\nDaniel, let's go to the more specific\ninformation that really helps us out.\n\n352\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.988\nNow this particular command\nthat I'm about to show you,\n\n353\n00:17:48.988 --> 00:17:52.080\nit's not only useful for\ntroubleshooting, but for verification.\n\n354\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.600\nAfter I configure a router\nas far as IP addresses and\n\n355\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.730\nmaking sure that everything is on,\nthere's only one command that I use, and\n\n356\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.810\nI do this on every single device, whether\nit's a switch or whether it's a router.\n\n357\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.590\nAnd this one is gonna be\nshow IP interface brief.\n\n358\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.240\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n359\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.790\nAnd when I do something like that, notice\nit gives me a nice little table here.\n\n360\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.440\nAnd I'll hit the enter key a few times so\nthat we can see everything.\n\n361\n00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.720\nAnd now I can take the diagram\nthat I've drawn, side by side,\n\n362\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.650\nand then do, okay, this is this one,\nthis is this one, and then go oops,\n\n363\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.510\nthat is absolutely not\nthe correct IP address on this.\n\n364\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.420\nEven though it's up, up, which means\nI did issue probably the no shutdown-\n\n365\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.790\n&gt;&gt; No shutdown.\n\n366\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.550\n&gt;&gt; I did actually type in the very wrong\n\n367\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.080\nIP address here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.790\n&gt;&gt; Which means I need to go ahead and\n\n369\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.310\nfix that.\n&gt;&gt; And it just goes to show,\n\n370\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.332\nback to what we were talking about, be\nvery systematic as you go through these.\n\n371\n00:18:54.332 --> 00:18:59.790\nIf you're logging into a network and you\nand you're going, I've got this router,\n\n372\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.930\nI've got this router, I've got this\nswitch and I have got to configure them.\n\n373\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.970\nAll right, let's start with the connection\nbetween this router and this switch.\n\n374\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.130\nNow let's talk about this\nrouter between this router.\n\n375\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.990\nAnd you configure each one of those,\nthen jump to the next device and\n\n376\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.320\ndo it in the exact same order.\n\n377\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.880\nThat way you know everything should be\ndone and you've done it systematically.\n\n378\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.970\nYou don't forget anything, and it should\nbe done in the right order because\n\n379\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.990\nprobably, Ronnie,\nyou just flip-flopped one,\n\n380\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.340\nthinking, I was on this router.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n381\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:23.940\n&gt;&gt; And that was it,\n\n382\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.300\nhe just was thinking he was-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n383\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.320\n&gt;&gt; On the wrong router and\n\n384\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.820\nthat's what happened.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n385\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.410\nit happens very easily when\nyou're trying to work quickly, so\n\n386\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.560\nthat's why it's very good that\nif you can go back and confirm.\n\n387\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.930\nBut confidence is the key, muscle memory\nis the key to also you doing this.\n\n388\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.140\nNow Daniel, I am about to type\nin an IP address here, but\n\n389\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.100\nnotice that on the interface\nI already have an IP address.\n\n390\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.550\nSo at this point, we gotta actually\nthink about what could happen here.\n\n391\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.840\nSo when you start doing this,\n\n392\n00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.010\nyou might go, well is that going to\nkeep two IP addresses on this thing?\n\n393\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.470\nOr, what is going to happen if\nI just simply type this in?\n\n394\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.670\nDo I need to remove the other IP address?\n\n395\n00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.790\nWell, if I wanted to remove\nthe other IP address,\n\n396\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.075\nthe neat thing is,\nthe command is fairly simple.\n\n397\n00:20:05.075 --> 00:20:07.440\nCuz I would just type in, no IP address,\n\n398\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.130\nwhich is the neatest thing because\nit's not some long drawn out thing.\n\n399\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.580\nIt really is just saying, take that off.\n\n400\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.690\nNo.\n\n401\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.830\nThen you can go ahead, and instead\nthis would be one 129 here instead.\n\n402\n00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.950\nBut the other thing that's also neat\nin the realm of CISCO command line\n\n403\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.740\nis that if this is\nespecially an IP address and\n\n404\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.550\nthe same type of IP address,\nit will allow me to just overwrite it.\n\n405\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.290\nSo I don't always have to issue\na command to erase the previous one.\n\n406\n00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.400\nNow is that always gonna be true?\n\n407\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.630\nNot always.\n\n408\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.455\nSo for example, with IPv6 addresses,\nyou can normally type in multiple\n\n409\n00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:49.440\nIPv6 addresses on a single interface,\nand it goes sure, why not?\n\n410\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.320\nI'll take it.\n\n411\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.990\nOkay?\nNow,\n\n412\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.810\ncan you also put multiple IP\naddresses on a single interface?\n\n413\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.330\nYes you can, called a secondary address.\n\n414\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.350\nWe're not gonna get into that.\n\n415\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.700\nBut yes, it is possible, so\nI do want you to know that.\n\n416\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.660\nThere are ways to do this, but for us\nright now, we're simply gonna change that.\n\n417\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:10.150\nAnd now, once I do that, we're going to\ngo back into our privilege exec mode,\n\n418\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:15.380\nand then do the same thing,\nshow IP interface brief.\n\n419\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.790\nAnd now that I have the proper ID address,\nor\n\n420\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.860\nat least I think it's the proper one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n421\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna ask Daniel\n\n422\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.460\nto check me here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n423\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.660\n&gt;&gt; That should say 192.168.16.193, okay?\n\n424\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.580\n&gt;&gt; 16.193, yeah, looks good.\n\n425\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.860\n&gt;&gt; So now I should be able\n\n426\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.095\nto ping the other side.\n&gt;&gt; Unless we're on the wrong router.\n\n427\n00:21:32.095 --> 00:21:33.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless I'm on the wrong router at\n\n428\n00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.260\nthis point, which is possible.\n&gt;&gt; It can happen.\n\n429\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.010\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be surprised.\n\n430\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.710\nDaniel, believe it or not,\nthat's happened to me more often than not.\n\n431\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.560\n&gt;&gt; It does occur.\n\n432\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.740\n&gt;&gt; And that is because all these\n\n433\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.820\ninterfaces look the same as\nfar as what it looks like.\n\n434\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Which just goes back to the importance\n\n435\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.481\nof making sure you-\n&gt;&gt; Host names.\n\n436\n00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:51.344\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The host names, so check them before\n\n437\n00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:55.275\nyou start [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have done mistakes more than\n\n438\n00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:58.340\none time doing that.\n&gt;&gt; And don't name them weird things like\n\n439\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.170\nHomer Simpson or whatever.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n440\n00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Name them like something appropriate to\n\n441\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.710\nwhat their function is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n442\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.560\nit's very helpful, especially if you have\na logical network that you're working on,\n\n443\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.480\nthat you name them something,\nI shouldn't say personalized but\n\n444\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.017\nif you name them after your spirit animal.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n445\n00:22:14.017 --> 00:22:15.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Spirit animal or\n\n446\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.340\nwhatever it might be or your my little\npony character whatever you want to.\n\n447\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.630\nDon't get me wrong, will it take it?\n\n448\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.790\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n449\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.260\n&gt;&gt; It will absolutely take it.\n\n450\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.560\nBut does it help you out in\nthe long term of you trying\n\n451\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.860\nto understand where\nthings are connected to?\n\n452\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.765\nNot really.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n453\n00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:31.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what\n\n454\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.460\nwe're talking about.\n\n455\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.410\nAll right, so now Daniel, there it is.\n\n456\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.500\nI now have it as being successful,\nwhich is fine.\n\n457\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.260\nSo this is actually good for\n\n458\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.890\nus when we actually do have everything\nset up the way that we want to.\n\n459\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.670\nBut just remember, in terms of\njust basic troubleshooting here,\n\n460\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.510\nthat's what has to happen when we\nstart doing something like this here\n\n461\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.790\nis that you need make sure, and as far as\nIP addresses go, and that's what we're\n\n462\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.420\nreally just troubleshooting at this point,\nthose are usually the two things.\n\n463\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.170\nEither the configuration on\nthe interface has been misconfigured,\n\n464\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.630\neither I didn't turn it on or like me,\nI put it on the wrong interface before.\n\n465\n00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.810\nOr the IP address, or\nthe subnet mask is typed in incorrectly.\n\n466\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.700\nThose are probably the most common.\n\n467\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.730\nNow are there other ones that can happen?\n\n468\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:17.450\nYeah, but\n\n469\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.080\nI don't know of anything that just\nthe IP address level in terms of IPv4.\n\n470\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.170\nSo once everything is done,\nnow you can go through and\n\n471\n00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.870\nyou test out the configuration.\n\n472\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.200\nYou get good connectivity.\n\n473\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.840\nThat is the groundwork that lays down for\n\n474\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.090\neverything else that we're about to\nbuild upon this, including routing.\n\n475\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.150\nAnd that's why it's so\nimportant that we get this stuff right.\n\n476\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.040\nSo at this point, Daniel, this really\n\n477\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.020\nends at least our IPv4 series\nhere in taking a look at the lab.\n\n478\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.850\nBut we still have IPv6 to go as well,\nso we need to jump into that.\n\n479\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.120\nBut that'll be for another one.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely going to be a whole new ball\n\n480\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.250\nof wax, but not a whole lot different\nthan what we've seen already.\n\n481\n00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.800\nSame ideas apply, just a different way\nof doing it, because we're using IPv6.\n\n482\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.765\nRonnie, looking forward to that,\ndefinitely.\n\n483\n00:24:00.765 --> 00:24:03.640\nHopefully, you are as well, but as\nthe man has said, we are out of time for\n\n484\n00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.500\nthis episode.\n\n485\n00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.150\nSigning off for

With the created networks, they show how to enable IPv6 routing on each router using ipv6 unicast-routing. They assign the ipv6 addresses on the router interfaces for connectivity.  Using show ipv6 interface brief, the team shows each interface with the global-unicast address assigned and also a self-assigned link-local address.",

00:00:08.019\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.959\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.753\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:16.638\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:18.717\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:22.165\nin today's episode we continue\non of more CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:26.056\nJoining us yet again, our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:27.996\nRonnie, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:31.162\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, Daniel,\nas we continue on in our journey here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:36.060\nOf course getting ready for\nour Cisco CCENT, and today we of course,\n\n13\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.538\nare going to configure IP version\n6 addresses inside of the lab\n\n14\n00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:42.920\nsetting that we have ready to go.\n\n15\n00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.677\nThe great thing about this is as\nwe start setting this up there's\n\n16\n00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:48.636\nnot a lot of different commands.\n\n17\n00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:52.232\nThere are a couple of different ones\nthat you have to pay attention to, but\n\n18\n00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:55.311\nthe configuration of the IP\naddresses is relatively the same.\n\n19\n00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:57.909\nAnd the difference of course\nis just IP version 6.\n\n20\n00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.778\nAnd the same thing even with\nthe commands themselves.\n\n21\n00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:04.940\nInstead of IP, like IP address,\nyou type in IPv6.\n\n22\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.594\nAnd that's kind of a clear indicator\nthere that something has changed.\n\n23\n00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:10.311\nNow before we jump into that, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:14.719\nSo when you get ready to start this,\nand you go do your practice labs, and\n\n25\n00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.046\nyou select that note, that lab here.\n\n26\n00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:20.534\nLet me make sure I show you what\nI'm talking, well I'm trying to.\n\n27\n00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:23.015\nToday my, there we go.\n\n28\n00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.726\nLike I said, today, maybe, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:25.287\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n30\n00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:27.294\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So once again,\n\n31\n00:01:27.294 --> 00:01:31.536\nas I come on through here there is\na configure IP version 6 instead.\n\n32\n00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:34.806\nNow I don't wanna switch off of this\ncuz it'll reboot my labs and stuff and\n\n33\n00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:36.517\nget everything the way that I want to.\n\n34\n00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:39.186\nBut you'll see that in\nthe third one in that series,\n\n35\n00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:40.893\nmake sure you select the V3 one.\n\n36\n00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.791\nSelect the one that\nsays Troubleshoot IPv6.\n\n37\n00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.828\nConfigure, verify,\ntroubleshoot that as well.\n\n38\n00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:48.590\nAnd the next one that's\nthere too will help us out.\n\n39\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.821\nSo this particular lab that you and\nI are about to do,\n\n40\n00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:53.815\nstart off in about the same way.\n\n41\n00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:59.760\nThat, well the IP version 4 lab starts\noff which is here is a network-\n\n42\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:02.442\n&gt;&gt; And I need three networks.\n\n44\n00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:07.149\nSo what we're talking about here, Daniel,\nis the dreaded word that if you haven't\n\n45\n00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.352\npulled out all of your hair by\nnow in learning how to do it.\n\n46\n00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:11.912\nThat means you are doing okay.\n\n47\n00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:14.898\nIf you haven't had a stroke because\nyou've been seeing just ones and\n\n48\n00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:18.619\nzeros in your sleep, and then you wake up\nsaying one, one, zero, zero, one, one.\n\n49\n00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.515\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're probably doing okay at\n\n50\n00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.033\nthis point.\n\n51\n00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.771\nSo I'm joking on that,\nhopefully nobody's ever done that.\n\n52\n00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:27.303\nBut at the same time you kind of\nrealize that there is a lot to go.\n\n53\n00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:32.293\nWe are going to do exactly what I told\nyou don't really have to do any more,\n\n54\n00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:35.931\nwhich is do a quick subnet\nof an IP version 6 address.\n\n55\n00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.655\nNow all of a sudden people's heads\nstarts throttling a little bit.\n\n56\n00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:41.039\nThat pain starts popping up.\n\n57\n00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.491\n&gt;&gt; Are you joking?\n\n58\n00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:47.323\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's always fun and a little bit\nfrustrating but we're gonna make it easy.\n\n59\n00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:50.188\nNow the reason why is that\nthey've actually made it easy for\n\n60\n00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:53.585\nus, they just say all right,\nwe just need three different networks.\n\n61\n00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:58.690\nSo were gonna do the easiest networks 1,\n2 and 3 is all were gonna do.\n\n62\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.392\nSo we can actually do many networks,\nat this point and\n\n63\n00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:07.837\nthe way that they have it, they've\ngiven us a slash 48 network here, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:13.725\n2-0-0-1 A, and then the rest are all zeros\ngoing all the way through the 120 bits,\n\n65\n00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:18.104\nand I'm just saying just pay attention\nto the first 48 bits as being\n\n66\n00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:20.546\nthe network portion of your address.\n\n67\n00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:24.528\nIf you take a look at, this is what it\nturns out to look like when you write it\n\n68\n00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:26.085\nout in hexadecimal, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:28.720\nSo I give the full format right here.\n\n70\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.610\nSo 2001:000a and then the rest are all\nzeros in everything that we have.\n\n71\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.326\nThe great thing is, we've already talked\nabout what each of these parts means.\n\n72\n00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:41.240\nSo what they're telling us here, right?\n\n73\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.873\nIs that, well, since the first 48 bits,\nyou're not gonna touch, right?\n\n74\n00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:46.992\nWe're not gonna touch the two,\n\n75\n00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:51.005\nwe're not going to touch these\nthree hexidecimal numbers.\n\n76\n00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:56.125\nWe're not gonna touch the next eight.\n\n77\n00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.747\nWow, did I combine\ndifferent words together?\n\n78\n00:03:58.747 --> 00:04:00.835\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's trying to\ntruncate abbreviated speech.\n\n79\n00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:03.608\n&gt;&gt; Tell me about it yeah, geez, yeah.\n\n80\n00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:08.855\nThe next eight hexidecimal digits\nbecause all of that equals 48 bits.\n\n81\n00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:13.467\nWell, they lined us up in our\nlabs to do exactly what your ISP\n\n82\n00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:18.104\nwould end up doing,\nwhich is assigning a subnet ID, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:18.104 --> 00:04:20.442\nThat's all they're really doing, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:23.257\nSo, that's why we're gonna\nmake it easy on us, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:23.257 --> 00:04:25.823\nNow the only thing that's\nactually tricky for\n\n86\n00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:30.097\nus at this point is remembering that even\nif we are doing something like this,\n\n87\n00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:33.680\nremember to pay attention to\nthe prefix link right here, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.012\nThis prefix I told you is probably\nthe important aspect of this.\n\n89\n00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:41.546\nIf you do this and you see an IP address\nand they give you some of this on\n\n90\n00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:44.784\nthe exam, which I highly doubt,\nbut it's possible, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:50.111\nIf you create a subnet, remember the\nnumber has to be bigger than this, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:52.205\nEverybody make sure you hear me, right?\n\n93\n00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.732\nIf it's a 47, a 32-\n&gt;&gt; Wrong.\n\n94\n00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:56.411\n&gt;&gt; Wrong, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:59.172\nIt has to be a larger number than 48.\n\n96\n00:04:59.172 --> 00:05:04.536\nBy default the majority of the networks\nthat are gonna be assigned are gonna be,\n\n97\n00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:07.110\nI think all of them, [CROSSTALK] 64.\n\n98\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.822\n&gt;&gt; A larger number than 48,\nyou mean 48 or larger or-\n\n99\n00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:11.622\n&gt;&gt; 49 and above.\n\n100\n00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:12.254\n&gt;&gt; 49.\n\n101\n00:05:12.254 --> 00:05:12.786\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n102\n00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:13.643\n&gt;&gt; So 49, 50.\n\n103\n00:05:13.643 --> 00:05:14.436\n&gt;&gt; 48 is no good.\n\n104\n00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:15.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 48 is no good.\n\n105\n00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:16.131\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n106\n00:05:16.131 --> 00:05:19.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at this point here it\nhas to be probably 49 or larger.\n\n107\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.849\nMore than likely the next network number\nthat they are going to give you if they\n\n108\n00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.603\nreally want to be realistic\nis gonna be a 64, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:27.338\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n110\n00:05:27.338 --> 00:05:29.860\n&gt;&gt; That is what you want\nto pay attention to.\n\n111\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.036\n&gt;&gt; Now I know that that sounds strange.\n\n112\n00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:33.806\nYou go, that's stupid, but\nthat's how it works, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:36.563\nIt is not stupid,\nit actually works this way.\n\n114\n00:05:36.563 --> 00:05:41.637\nSo if you pick the same addresses\nthat we're about to type out here,\n\n115\n00:05:41.637 --> 00:05:45.922\nand you leave it as a slash 48,\nit will be wrong, okay?\n\n116\n00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:48.590\nJust a notification for you.\n\n117\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.655\nIt will be wrong.\n\n118\n00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:51.045\nDon't do that, okay.\n\n119\n00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:52.997\nBut hopefully you won't\nsee anything like this.\n\n120\n00:05:52.997 --> 00:05:54.937\nSo, what are we gonna do to change this?\n\n121\n00:05:54.937 --> 00:06:00.204\nWell, remember that what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna take a look and we're gonna\n\n122\n00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:05.412\ntake the first 48 bits of this and we're\nnot gonna pay attention to it all, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:05.412 --> 00:06:08.385\nSo when we do something like this,\nthis is how it's going to go,\n\n124\n00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:10.546\nso that's gonna be this is 16 bits, right?\n\n125\n00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:14.602\nThe 2000, 2-0-0-1,\nI keep saying 2000 but that's the wrong.\n\n126\n00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:19.228\n2-0-0-1 and then 00A and then 00000,\n\n127\n00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:23.762\nwe are not gonna pay attention to at all,\nall right?\n\n128\n00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:25.616\nSo those first 48 we're done.\n\n129\n00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:28.391\nSo how do I come up with the next ID here?\n\n130\n00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:33.386\nWell, I just take that fourth section,\nand I'll just change that to a 1.\n\n131\n00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:37.377\nAnd now I've gone ahead and\nI've made that conversion for us.\n\n132\n00:06:37.377 --> 00:06:41.435\nThe next number here,\nwe'll just change this to a 2.\n\n133\n00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:46.420\nAnd then the final one here,\nwe'll change to a 3.\n\n134\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:52.328\nNow that's still a lot to type in or some\nof the IP addresses that we're gonna do.\n\n135\n00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.815\nSo we're gonna truncate this.\n\n136\n00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:55.637\nNow before I do this, Dan,\n\n137\n00:06:55.637 --> 00:07:00.886\nlet me try to mention what in theory this\ncould actually turn out to be, right?\n\n138\n00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:04.393\nThe very first host on this\nfirst network here, Daniel.\n\n139\n00:07:04.393 --> 00:07:08.283\nIf we were to try and do this thing\nlike broadcast and everything,\n\n140\n00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:10.490\njust to give you an example, right?\n\n141\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.486\nRemember that the first host on this,\nif the network ID,\n\n142\n00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:18.816\nin other words this interface\nID over here, right, Daniel,\n\n143\n00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:23.421\nis all zeroes that is the same as\nmy network ID In 32 bit in IPv4.\n\n144\n00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:27.661\nSo this is ny network number,\nwhich is this one here.\n\n145\n00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:32.070\nSo the rest of these If I wanted actually\nto identify the very first host,\n\n146\n00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.817\nI would change that to a one.\n\n147\n00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:35.089\nMake sense?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n148\n00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:39.625\n&gt;&gt; So if we now remember back to our\nsudden ending and the broadcast for\n\n149\n00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.574\nthe 32 bit, is when what?\n\n150\n00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:42.758\nThe host portion is, what?\n\n151\n00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:44.741\nAll ones, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:49.623\nSo this is a little bit different here\nin the very fact that this instead\n\n153\n00:07:49.623 --> 00:07:52.784\nwould actually turn\ninto the highest order.\n\n154\n00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:57.618\nWhich is all Fs is what\nthe next section would be.\n\n155\n00:07:57.618 --> 00:07:58.957\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nbecause this is hexidecimal, not-\n\n156\n00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:00.091\n&gt;&gt; Hexidecimal.\n\n157\n00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:00.680\nBinary.\n\n158\n00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.363\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a decimal, not binary.\n\n159\n00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:08.990\nSo this would actually be your\nbroadcast ID right here, okay.\n\n160\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.720\nSo then what will be our last host?\n\n161\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.940\nWell that would be if we\nhave the digits 0 through 9,\n\n162\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.954\nand then the letters A through F.\n\n163\n00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.210\nSo what's the letter right before F?\n\n164\n00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.480\nA, B, C, D, E, so that would be E, okay.\n\n165\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.500\nSo that's exactly what we would have.\n\n166\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.290\nThat range from all those 0s and\na 1, okay,\n\n167\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.900\nto all the way through all these Fs and\nthe last letter of E, okay.\n\n168\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.560\nAnd that's because of\nthe hexadecimal format.\n\n169\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.750\nSo that's how that ends up working if you\nwere to manually assign every single IP,\n\n170\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.630\nif you wanted to, okay.\n\n171\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.600\nDaniel, that sounds\nlike a nightmare to me.\n\n172\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.280\nSo I'm probably not gonna ever\ndo anything like that, but\n\n173\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.380\njust to show you that that's what\nwould end up happening, okay.\n\n174\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.720\nNow the great thing is since all\nof these are really all 0s here.\n\n175\n00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.830\nLet me see, good.\n\n176\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.420\nI was hoping that Ctrl+Z would work.\n\n177\n00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.250\nI was like, cool, that worked here.\n\n178\n00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.300\nWhat am I going to end up doing?\n\n179\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.560\nI'm gonna actually keep this network,\nbut I know I'm just gonna use\n\n180\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.070\nthe first two IP addresses,\nwhich is gonna be a 1 and a 2, okay.\n\n181\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.410\nSo I'm good there, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.400\nThe same thing over here then.\n\n183\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.760\nWe're fine, and I'll probably use a 1 and\na 2 here, and the same thing over here,\n\n184\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.560\n1 and 2 just to keep it nice and easy.\n\n185\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, simple, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now the other thing though is,\n\n186\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.820\ndo I have to type all this in for\nan IP address on a router's interface?\n\n187\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.410\nNo, you can, but you don't have to.\n\n188\n00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.907\nWe also told you that in the way\nthat this is reported, right,\n\n189\n00:09:31.907 --> 00:09:33.668\nit shortens the format for us.\n\n190\n00:09:33.668 --> 00:09:37.713\nSo what we can do is we can\nstart by going in here and\n\n191\n00:09:37.713 --> 00:09:42.370\nkind of reducing it by simply\nremoving leading zeroes.\n\n192\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.740\nSo we could do something like that.\n\n193\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.170\nAnd then what about this\ncontiguous space of 0s here?\n\n194\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.900\nRemember that that can be truncated,\nonce again.\n\n195\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Double colon.\n\n196\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.130\n&gt;&gt; All the way down to double colon.\n\n197\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.290\nSo now, look at that, Daniel,\nthat looks like a much easier for\n\n198\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.250\nme to be able to type it.\n\n199\n00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.010\n&gt;&gt; Much more manageable,\nyeah, I like that.\n\n200\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.360\n&gt;&gt; A lot more easier to be able\nto type that in as well, okay.\n\n201\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.700\nSo the same thing here.\n\n202\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.456\nSo if we did the same thing, there we are.\n\n203\n00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:14.630\nWe're moving everything but\nall the leading zeroes, and\n\n204\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.270\nthen the last section here\nwe can actually do this.\n\n205\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.587\nAnd then finally the third one is\nthe same thing where we start off by\n\n206\n00:10:25.587 --> 00:10:30.380\nremoving all the leading 0s,\noops, too many 0s at that point.\n\n207\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.396\nRemember that we can only have\nthat double colon one time.\n\n208\n00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:41.322\nWait, that was supposed to be a 0 and\nthen a 1, or a 3, sorry, my fault.\n\n209\n00:10:41.322 --> 00:10:42.840\nKind of did something\na little bit wrong there.\n\n210\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.400\nAnd then the 64 bits over here,\n\n211\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.585\nwe're gonna truncate that all\nthe way to the double colon, okay.\n\n212\n00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:53.800\nSo we're not really getting into the\nmechanics of doing the sub netting, but\n\n213\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.830\nthis is a network that they\ngave us in our labs, and\n\n214\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.380\nI don't want to lead you too far\nastray in what you're actually doing.\n\n215\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.023\nSo from here we'll actually create these\ntwo different addresses to attach along\n\n216\n00:11:05.023 --> 00:11:06.377\nwith this here, okay.\n\n217\n00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:13.100\nSo what does one of my addresses\nlook like if I were to do this?\n\n218\n00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.617\nWell I'll take this, And\n\n219\n00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:21.093\nnow in between the double colons there,\n\n220\n00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:25.965\nmy very first address\nwould look like this,\n\n221\n00:11:25.965 --> 00:11:30.705\n2001:a:0, oops, 1 and then 2,\n\n222\n00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:37.968\noops ::2 representing all 2s in between or\nall 0s, all 2s.\n\n223\n00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:48.018\nSo that's what you'll actually end\nup seeing even for each one of these\n\n224\n00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:53.291\nas I can now, trying to use my functions\nhere to help speed this process up.\n\n225\n00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:58.330\nAnd the only thing I'm changing now\nis the network ID number for us.\n\n226\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.910\nSo this one will be a 2, and\n\n227\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:06.450\nthis one will also end up being a 2,\nand this one here a 3.\n\n228\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.290\nOops, see fat fingering stuff.\n\n229\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.030\nIt doesn't help.\n\n230\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.430\n&gt;&gt; No, it's bad, Ronnie.\n\n231\n00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.070\n&gt;&gt; It is bad.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.800\n&gt;&gt; It is really bad, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.310\nNow I may not need all of these addresses,\nbut\n\n234\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.020\nI want to know that if I have one and\nif I can, right, I'm gonna\n\n235\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.820\nwrite these things down because I don't\nwant to go, do I need this address or not?\n\n236\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.905\nI'd rather have one too\nmany than not enough,\n\n237\n00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:30.380\nespecially if I'm under a time constraint.\n\n238\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.890\nSo that way I'm not trying to\nguess which one should I use.\n\n239\n00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.110\nI can then look over at the dry\nerase board that I have and\n\n240\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.780\njust simply mark I used that one,\nI used that one, I used that one.\n\n241\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.910\nCrud, I forgot this one.\n\n242\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.130\nI can use the other other.\n\n243\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.160\nAnd I'm not trying to go, what was that?\n\n244\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.215\nLet me reconfigure that.\n\n245\n00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:48.760\nJust get a set that you need.\n\n246\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.970\nFor us, everything is kind\nof point to point right now,\n\n247\n00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:55.640\nso we'll just use these address that\nwe came up with to configure our lab.\n\n248\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.460\nSo in theory then the topology\nis pretty much just the same,\n\n249\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.710\nbut this time we are going to be\nassigning well IP addresses on this,\n\n250\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.240\nIP version 6 addresses, excuse me,\non these interfaces instead.\n\n251\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.600\nI'm going to get it right.\n\n252\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.521\n&gt;&gt; We did that before, Ronnie.\n\n253\n00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:12.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, IP version 4, yeah, so\n\n254\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.280\nthere you go, okay.\n\n255\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.950\nSo here it is.\n\n256\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:21.580\nI'm gonna put the 1.1 on this side,\nand then 1/2, I can't say that.\n\n257\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.520\nSo the way that it worked, right, is that\nthis one's gonna be 1 on the 1 network,\n\n258\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.110\nand this is gonna be the first interface\nand this is gonna be the second interface.\n\n259\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.280\nOn the other side of the WAN,\n\n260\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.080\nif I need to, I can address this one,\nwhich is 2 and then ::1.\n\n261\n00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.690\nAnd then on this side, this is the only\none that we are really going to\n\n262\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.850\nconfigure which is the 3::1 here, okay.\n\n263\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.510\nAnd then on the ISP, you and\nI don't get to configure that one.\n\n264\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.610\nThat one is already preconfigured\nat some other point in time\n\n265\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.440\nas we need it to, okay.\n\n266\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.390\nSo for\nright now that is gonna be our topology.\n\n267\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.720\nSo I always like to start with the central\none here, which is NYEDGE, and\n\n268\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.850\nget those interfaces configured too.\n\n269\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.449\nI'm gonna follow the same thing where\nI'm gonna put the first interface,\n\n270\n00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:08.519\nwhich is gonna be the 0 0 right here,\nall right.\n\n271\n00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:11.772\nNow let me see if I can\nscroll down here and\n\n272\n00:14:11.772 --> 00:14:16.747\nget this all on the screen as we begin to,\ntake that out, yep,\n\n273\n00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:20.133\nthat's actually a good font size for us.\n\n274\n00:14:22.353 --> 00:14:23.530\nHit Enter a couple of times.\n\n275\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.559\nI'm in user mode,\nI need to get into privilege exec mode.\n\n276\n00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:31.901\nAnd then once I'm in there I want\nto go to configure terminal,\n\n277\n00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:37.365\nand now in configure terminal\nlet me do the interface gigabit.\n\n278\n00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:41.622\nI gotta get the cursor out of the way.\n\n279\n00:14:41.622 --> 00:14:46.872\nGigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n280\n00:14:46.872 --> 00:14:50.235\nNow when I do this here,\nthere is something that I just forgot and\n\n281\n00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:52.420\nI remembered right now, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.160\nYou can start typing in IP\nversion 6 addresses right away.\n\n283\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.250\nBut let me escape this here, let me go\nahead and exit from here for a moment.\n\n284\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.320\nGet all the way back out to,\n\n285\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.786\nactually I need to go into\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n286\n00:15:05.786 --> 00:15:09.213\nSo configure terminal, okay.\n\n287\n00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:13.273\nIn IP version 6,\nif you're going to be using IP version 6,\n\n288\n00:15:13.273 --> 00:15:17.350\nmore than likely you're not\nusing it just to assign, okay.\n\n289\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:22.170\nYou're normally using it because you\nwant to begin routing in IP version 6.\n\n290\n00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.708\nOn routers, okay, before you can actually\nenable any IP version 6 routing,\n\n291\n00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:30.655\nthere is a command that I suggest\nthat you make default here, okay.\n\n292\n00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:39.270\nWhich is gonna be ipv6 unicast-routing,\nokay.\n\n293\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.570\nThat essentially enables the router\nglobally here at this point.\n\n294\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.710\nThat is gonna say, all right,\nI can handle IPv6 routing, okay.\n\n295\n00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.183\nI can run those routing protocols\nthat are are IPv6, I can do that.\n\n296\n00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:54.245\n&gt;&gt; So this isn't running by default,\nyou have to say, hey,\n\n297\n00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.940\nI wanna do some IPv6 here,\nso let's turn that on?\n\n298\n00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, you can assign an IPv6\naddress but then when you go and try and\n\n299\n00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:02.889\nroute it it's gonna say I\ndon't know what you're doing.\n\n300\n00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:03.799\nYeah, not really.\n\n301\n00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:04.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think you forgot\nsomething there buddy.\n\n302\n00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:07.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I recommend that you turn this on\n\n303\n00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.540\nby default, so just go ahead and\nget that set up.\n\n304\n00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.110\nAnd that's why I wanted to\ndo that first here instead.\n\n305\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:20.824\nSo, interface gigabitethernet 0/0\n\n306\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.491\nAll right now that I'm actually inside of\nthe interface here I want to type in ipv6\n\n307\n00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:29.849\naddress and\nthis is where you'd look over and\n\n308\n00:16:29.849 --> 00:16:34.070\nfind the number that you're supposed to\ntype in and that's what I'm supposed to\n\n309\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.450\nbe doing right now here at least\nthat's what I'm hoping here.\n\n310\n00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.800\nI'm turning my pages the wrong way, so\nI know I'm not doing it correctly here.\n\n311\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.817\nOkay, so this is where,\non this one it would be 2001: for\n\n312\n00:16:47.817 --> 00:16:51.864\nus here, and this would be a then a 0, and\n\n313\n00:16:51.864 --> 00:16:56.755\nthat's the first 48 bits, then a :1::1.\n\n314\n00:16:56.755 --> 00:17:01.701\nThen this one allows\nus to do that slash or\n\n315\n00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:05.490\nthe prefix notation instead.\n\n316\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.900\nNow, I don't remember it\nactually takes a space or\n\n317\n00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.290\nnot, but\nI wanna try it without the space first.\n\n318\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.230\nThe reason why that's gonna be important\nis that it is different syntactically.\n\n319\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.520\nSo if it doesn't take it,\nthat means it's wrong.\n\n320\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.000\nBut it took it just fine, okay?\n\n321\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.258\nTricky things on the Cisco exam.\n\n322\n00:17:23.258 --> 00:17:24.214\n&gt;&gt; Very.\n&gt;&gt; A space,\n\n323\n00:17:24.214 --> 00:17:27.180\ncan actually be the difference here\n&gt;&gt; Make or break you.\n\n324\n00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.365\n&gt;&gt; Can, yeah and so if you see two answers\nthat are exactly same, you're like,\n\n325\n00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:31.880\nwhat is the difference here?\n\n326\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.045\nIt could be a space and they mean that, so\n\n327\n00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:36.923\ndon't think that you can go,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n328\n00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:37.791\nIt matters.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n329\n00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:39.710\n&gt;&gt; It is not trivial.\n\n330\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.427\nAnd then I'm gonna issue\na no shutdown command.\n\n331\n00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:47.396\nThe other thing then is I can also\njump to the next interface I want\n\n332\n00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:51.184\nto configure which is\ngigabit ethernet 0/1.\n\n333\n00:17:51.184 --> 00:17:58.520\nAnd on this one make sure I'm\ntelling you right here on ny edge.\n\n334\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.460\nWant you up 3, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.880\nNow I'm gonna do ipv6,\nremember that that's the keyword for us.\n\n336\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.060\nDo not let them fool you and\nthen just type in IP address and\n\n337\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.450\nthen you see an IP version 6 number,\nmake sure you pay attention to the ipv6.\n\n338\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:20.310\n2001 a:0 and then 3.\n\n339\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.543\nAnd then this one is\nalso going to be a 1/64.\n\n340\n00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:27.430\nNow, let me do this.\n\n341\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.940\nLet me see what happens with\na space in here instead.\n\n342\n00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.580\nSo if it accepts both that would be neat,\nbut let's see what happens, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.370\nNotice now, you actually see\nwhere it doesn't accept it, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.280\nSo don't put it past Cisco to do\nsomething like this on the exam.\n\n345\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.661\nWhere you see this, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:43.661 --> 00:18:47.650\nAlso that's a great indicator I think\nDaniel has pointed out multiple times\n\n347\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.650\nas we start lab,\nwhen you see that little carrot symbol.\n\n348\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.738\nYou should know that that means\nan invalid input that says,\n\n349\n00:18:53.738 --> 00:18:55.785\nI don't like what's happening here.\n\n350\n00:18:55.785 --> 00:19:00.329\nAnd even though this points\nat the slash that make you\n\n351\n00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:05.283\nthink that is really saying\nthe space is what is going, so\n\n352\n00:19:05.283 --> 00:19:13.253\njust kind of be aware when you do this\nipv6 address 2001:a:0:3:, then /64.\n\n353\n00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:19.040\nNow the other thing that I can't\ndo in this interface Daniel\n\n354\n00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.690\nthat would really be helpful at times\nlike this there are some shortcuts key.\n\n355\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.580\nNormally on a keyboard right?\n\n356\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.900\nSo they have a history.\n\n357\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.040\nSo in theory, right?\n\n358\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.871\nEverything that I'm typing in right here,\n\n359\n00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:35.450\nit's actually getting recorded\nin a little history buffer.\n\n360\n00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.052\nWhat does that mean?\n\n361\n00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:40.380\nThat means when I mistype this one\nwith the space here Daniel, and\n\n362\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.550\nI wanted to correct it,\nI could actually hit my up arrow and that\n\n363\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.650\nwould have reprinted that last command\nthat I would have typed in right then.\n\n364\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.670\nThen I could have used my arrows as well,\nor\n\n365\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.190\neven some of the other shortcut keys,\nokay?\n\n366\n00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.943\nSo using I think, it's control e.\n\n367\n00:19:57.943 --> 00:20:01.899\nControl e would have actually allowed me\nto go to the end of the line, then I could\n\n368\n00:20:01.899 --> 00:20:05.499\nhave back-spaced using my left arrow,\nback right before that slash and\n\n369\n00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:08.710\nthen hit my delete, and\nbe able to actually pull that in, okay?\n\n370\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.138\nIf I wanted to go to the beginning of\nthe line it would be control a, and\n\n371\n00:20:12.138 --> 00:20:15.700\nthat would have put me at\nthe beginning of the line, as well.\n\n372\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.810\nSo, those are some of\nthe other shortcut keys.\n\n373\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.440\nMake sure you know about Control A,\nas well as Control E, and the arrow keys.\n\n374\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.330\nThose are kind of the easy ones now.\n\n375\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.040\nThe great thing is most of the Cisco\ncommands are not normally very long.\n\n376\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.410\nThere are some that\nare a little bit longer, but\n\n377\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:36.680\nmost of them are usually two or three,\nmaybe four words max a lot of times.\n\n378\n00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.090\nSo they aren't very long commands\nthat you have to really memorize.\n\n379\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.230\nAs far as super long commands.\n\n380\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.149\nShort ones, yes.\n\n381\n00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:47.040\nYou should know some of these short ones,\nokay?\n\n382\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.800\nLet's do a no shutdown.\n\n383\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.232\nAll right?\n\n384\n00:20:51.232 --> 00:20:55.860\nSo now I have that edge router configured.\n\n385\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.980\nLet me go ahead and also, now set the WAN\nrouter, which is going to be NYWAN.\n\n386\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.285\nNow on my configuration right now,\nand that's weird, okay?\n\n387\n00:21:10.285 --> 00:21:13.045\nIt doesn't show me the whole\nscreen right away.\n\n388\n00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:14.205\nBut NYWAN here,\n\n389\n00:21:14.205 --> 00:21:18.745\nlet me the Enter a couple of times,\nget into our global configuration mode.\n\n390\n00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:22.410\nSo on this one, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.405\nWe want to set this one up and we`re gonna\nput two IP addresses on this one as well.\n\n392\n00:21:26.405 --> 00:21:31.970\nAnd this is gonna be the two, and\nthe actual one network too, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.570\nSo let's set this up the same way.\n\n394\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.230\nSo interface.\n\n395\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.840\nGuess what I forgot, Daniel?\n\n396\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.326\n&gt;&gt; What did you forget?\n\n397\n00:21:39.326 --> 00:21:43.790\n&gt;&gt; ipv6\n&gt;&gt; Unicast-routing, okay?\n\n398\n00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.100\nNow there's something else I'm also gonna\ntype in that's gonna be a little bit\n\n399\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.190\nextra on this one here, okay.\n\n400\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.568\nSo make sure, at least I hope\nI make sure I can remember.\n\n401\n00:21:54.568 --> 00:22:01.591\nGigabit, oops ethernet 0/0 and\n\n402\n00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:06.975\nnow I can do an ipv6 address\n\n403\n00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:12.126\n2001:a:0:1 and\n\n404\n00:22:12.126 --> 00:22:17.754\nthen ::2/ 64, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:22.912\nNow the other thing that you can do and\nthat's also in your lab\n\n406\n00:22:22.912 --> 00:22:29.390\nguide is that you can actually do\nthe enable command here, too, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:35.066\nSo there is another command that you\ncan also type in, that actually is,\n\n408\n00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:39.827\nI'm typing it in wrong here,\nwhich is ipv6 enable, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:39.827 --> 00:22:41.993\nYou do not have to do this, okay?\n\n410\n00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.810\nBut they do show it to you for\nthe sake of completeness.\n\n411\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:49.200\nNormally when you put an ipv6 address\non there, it automatically does it.\n\n412\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.370\nBut I think in the earliest\nconfigurations of it, you had to do it.\n\n413\n00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.980\nWhere you had to type in ipv6 enable.\n\n414\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.910\nAnd now, wait,\nit doesn't like the slash, I forgot.\n\n415\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.550\nSee, this is where I forget this.\n\n416\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:07.522\nSo on this one it will be IPv6 address\n\n417\n00:23:07.522 --> 00:23:12.533\n2001:a:0:1:: and\n\n418\n00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:19.670\nthen IPv6 enable nope\nam lying to you what?\n\n419\n00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:22.581\nIt's actually the next.\n\n420\n00:23:22.581 --> 00:23:23.363\nThat's my fault here, okay?\n\n421\n00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:25.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was on the same line.\n\n422\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.470\n&gt;&gt; It's okay Ronnie, it's okay.\n\n423\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I thought it was on the same line.\n\n424\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.800\nThat's my fault, totally.\n\n425\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.490\nOkay?\nSo I needed to look down here and\n\n426\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:32.820\nI just didn't want to.\n\n427\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.933\nIPv6 address.\n\n428\n00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:38.945\nI should be able to type\nthis in again a:0:12/64.\n\n429\n00:23:38.945 --> 00:23:44.156\nSo once I type that in there\nthen it's ipv6 enable.\n\n430\n00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:50.631\nMake sure I'm telling you right,\nyeah, enable.\n\n431\n00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:54.558\nSo it accepts that as well, no shutdown.\n\n432\n00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:56.387\nSo it is an either or thing but\n\n433\n00:23:56.387 --> 00:24:02.150\nthere are people that like doing it either\nway here is what you also end up seeing.\n\n434\n00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.730\nTo.\nAll right, so that's kind of one of\n\n435\n00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:10.390\nthe ones that you will end up encountering\nevery once in a while as well, okay?\n\n436\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.990\nLet's go to the next interface,\n\n437\n00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:20.416\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/1 and\n\n438\n00:24:20.416 --> 00:24:26.006\nthen IPv6 address 2001A:0: and\n\n439\n00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:33.727\nthis one, let me make sure\nI'm telling you right here,\n\n440\n00:24:33.727 --> 00:24:38.514\non the other side is going to be 2.\n\n441\n00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:46.142\nFinally, :1 /64 and\n\n442\n00:24:46.142 --> 00:24:53.066\nthen IPv6 enable, no shutdown.\n\n443\n00:24:56.509 --> 00:24:57.121\nAll right, so\n\n444\n00:24:57.121 --> 00:25:00.500\nwe've actually got every interface that\nwe wanted configured at this point.\n\n445\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.730\nAnd then for us now to just\nverify a couple of commands here\n\n446\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:10.460\nas well is we wanna look at the more\nspecific command like we showed you.\n\n447\n00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.361\nBut the problem is if if I do the IP,\nshow ip interface brief,\n\n448\n00:25:15.361 --> 00:25:20.762\nthat's actually for version four,\nthat's not for version six.\n\n449\n00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:22.190\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't show any\nIPv6 up there does it?\n\n450\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.491\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't,\nit doesn't show any IPv6 information.\n\n451\n00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:29.047\nSo if I were to do that,\nthat would kind of not really be helpful.\n\n452\n00:25:29.047 --> 00:25:33.986\nSo this one, let's get out of this,\ngo back into\n\n453\n00:25:33.986 --> 00:25:39.300\nthe privileged mode,\nshow IPv6 interface brief.\n\n454\n00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:45.140\nNow you'll see it, but notice it\nlooks at it differently here, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.030\nSo instead of being a table across,\nit gives us a list.\n\n456\n00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.850\nNow Daniel, did you see me type\nin two IP version 6 addresses?\n\n457\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.276\n&gt;&gt; Not that I recall.\n\n458\n00:25:54.276 --> 00:25:57.446\n&gt;&gt; But I have to IPv6 addresses now.\n\n459\n00:25:57.446 --> 00:25:59.358\n&gt;&gt; What is this witchcraft?\n\n460\n00:25:59.358 --> 00:26:03.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nthis lets you know something once we've\n\n461\n00:26:03.263 --> 00:26:07.081\ndid that IPv6 unit cast,\nrouting and everything,\n\n462\n00:26:07.081 --> 00:26:12.290\nit says, hey were about to start\ncommunicating in IPv6 here.\n\n463\n00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.380\nThe main communication between,\n\n464\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.260\nwell routers in IPv6 happens\nbased on the link local address.\n\n465\n00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.260\nSo if you don't have it says,\nI'm going to assign one.\n\n466\n00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.230\nSo it automatically generates\nits own link local address too\n\n467\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.040\nbecause that's only locally significant.\n\n468\n00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.450\nIn other words this only\nmatters to that router.\n\n469\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.790\nOkay, that's the only\nthing that it matters to.\n\n470\n00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n471\n00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.580\n&gt;&gt; So\nthey have to be unique on that router, and\n\n472\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.570\nnotice this one is only one digit up here.\n\n473\n00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.170\nBut they don't have to actually be\ndifferent on the other router, you know,\n\n474\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:43.940\nso every router,\n\n475\n00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.390\nevery single one has to be unique, but\nyou can actually assign the same thing.\n\n476\n00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.600\nNow here it's just self generated, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.908\nSo this one is automatically generated for\nus,\n\n478\n00:26:51.908 --> 00:26:55.380\nwe don't have to worry about it,\nwe don't have to do anything with it.\n\n479\n00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.500\nAnd that's what can happen when we\nstart seeing this information too.\n\n480\n00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.820\nNow, can you control this if you want to?\n\n481\n00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:07.550\nYes, you can go in and you can manually\nassign your own link local address,\n\n482\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.740\nand when you do so, it overrides this one.\n\n483\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.280\nSo, if you want that control,\nyou can go ahead and do that.\n\n484\n00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:21.640\nNow Daniel, for my sake, when I do this I\ndon't wanna type in two IPv6 addresses.\n\n485\n00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.040\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like more work to me.\n\n486\n00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.451\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like an insane\namount of work to me.\n\n487\n00:27:25.451 --> 00:27:27.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if there is a reason for\n\n488\n00:27:27.585 --> 00:27:31.680\nyou to do so, and it could be, I don't\nknow of any reason right now Daniel,\n\n489\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.630\nbut if there is a reason for you to\ncontrol this that you want to do it,\n\n490\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.130\nit's perfectly fine that you do so, okay?\n\n491\n00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.850\nSo remember that what happens here, and\nDaniel I'm starting to see something in\n\n492\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.710\nthis IP address, I look right smack\ndab in the middle of this address, and\n\n493\n00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.940\nI see that FFFE and\nalso FFFE right here too, okay?\n\n494\n00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:57.309\nWhen I see something like that I know\nthat this is that extended unique\n\n495\n00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:02.297\nidentifier which means it took the Mac\naddress, divided it up into 24 bits and\n\n496\n00:28:02.297 --> 00:28:04.765\nthen inserted 16 bits in the middle.\n\n497\n00:28:04.765 --> 00:28:10.049\nYou have 24, 24 on each side, and\nthen in the middle they added 16,\n\n498\n00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:14.900\nwhich gives us 64 additional bits,\nwhen added right, again.\n\n499\n00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.280\nSo it gives us that 64 bits,\nso it generated the last\n\n500\n00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.790\nportion of this for us and everything\nelse that it did, and now you have that.\n\n501\n00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:31.874\nSo you can, if you want to actually go\nahead and type in link local addresses\n\n502\n00:28:31.874 --> 00:28:37.868\nto your heart's content, and start doing\nzero, one, two, three, four, go for it.\n\n503\n00:28:37.868 --> 00:28:38.952\n&gt;&gt; More power to you.\n\n504\n00:28:38.952 --> 00:28:39.747\n&gt;&gt; More power to you.\n\n505\n00:28:39.747 --> 00:28:41.910\nI dontt want to do that, okay?\n\n506\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.218\nBut just kind of realize,\nit can be done if you choose to do that.\n\n507\n00:28:45.218 --> 00:28:46.000\nAnd the only reason for\n\n508\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.260\nyou to normally do that is because\nyou do want that type of control.\n\n509\n00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:49.970\nYou don't wanna look and go,\n\n510\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.380\nI don't know which interfaces wass from,\nmake sure you put in like, you know,\n\n511\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.380\nyou somehow go, like in this octet,\nthere's gonna be rather one you put a one.\n\n512\n00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.514\nYou know, and you put, you know and\nthen the interface number,\n\n513\n00:29:00.514 --> 00:29:03.434\nin that way you know and\nthen you can tell as it comes across.\n\n514\n00:29:03.434 --> 00:29:04.681\nBut over all though,\n\n515\n00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:09.142\nI would not take the majority of the time\nin doing anything like this, okay?\n\n516\n00:29:09.142 --> 00:29:13.940\nAll right, so Daniel at this point we now\nhave those IP addresses configured and\n\n517\n00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.150\nthat means we're now\nready to go through and\n\n518\n00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.950\ntake a look at verifying that\neverything is actually set up right.\n\n519\n00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.827\nAnd then do a little bit of\ntroubleshooting cuz we know that there's\n\n520\n00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:25.056\nsome issues that can come up, but now\na lot of issues which is pretty cool, so\n\n521\n00:29:25.056 --> 00:29:27.900\nthat will be another episode,\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, that sounds great,\n\n522\n00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.170\nthis has been very enlightening so far.\n\n523\n00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:35.020\nWhen it comes to the IPv6 again hopefully,\nif this is your first forte into that it's\n\n524\n00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.145\nbecoming quite apparent, it's not as\nscary as some people made it of to be,\n\n525\n00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:41.405\nit's not quite the boogeyman,\nas you might have thought.\n\n526\n00:29:41.405 --> 00:29:44.060\nIt's just a little different,\nbut once you get used to it,\n\n527\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.000\nyou should be able to crank away and\nhave no problem.\n\n528\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.130\nRonnie, look forward to seeing you in the\nnext part for this period of our series,\n\n529\n00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.950\nbut we are out of time so\nwe are going to have to call it quits.\n\n530\n00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.050\nThanks for joining us everybody,\n\n531\n00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.880\nsigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n532\n00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:09.515\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n4\n00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.931\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:16.735\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:20.540\nI'm your house Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we continue on,\n\n7\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.350\nwe march forth, we persevere.\n\n8\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.680\nWhen it comes to the CCENT series\nwe've been working on so hard and\n\n9\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.840\njoining us back in the studio, our general\nin charge of everything, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.710\nRonnie welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.440\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.110\nThank you for having me back on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.950\nWe are continuing of\ncourse on our journey and\n\n14\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.860\nnow into IP version 6 getting ready for\nthe Cisco C7 exam.\n\n15\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.320\nWe're picking up in the midst of a lab so\n\n16\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400\nthat we now finished\nconfiguring the IP addresses.\n\n17\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.340\nWe're now ready for a little bit\nof verification that everything\n\n18\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.020\nis working the way that needs to.\n\n19\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.610\nSo we'll actually find that\nout as we get to that.\n\n20\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.340\nNow before we do that,\nDaniel in the previous episode,\n\n21\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.940\nI said, I don't wanna configure these\nlinked local addresses so we saw that they\n\n22\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.660\nwere configured automatically.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n23\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.550\n&gt;&gt; But just when I said that,\n\n24\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130\nI was like, I wanna try something.\n\n25\n00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.140\nCuz I said something, and then after that\nshow's over, I don't know if I actually\n\n26\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.620\nsaid that was absolutely 100% correct,\nand then I had to verify something.\n\n27\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.800\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n28\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.890\nI'll show you what I'm talking about here,\nokay?\n\n29\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.100\nSo remember when we talked about\nthe idea of using the, where is it?\n\n30\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.820\nLet me see, there it is, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.630\nSo we took a look at these addresses,\n\n32\n00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.280\nhow we didn't actually\nprogram them in there, right?\n\n33\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.711\nSo these particular link local\naddresses were not programmed.\n\n34\n00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:31.978\nAnd I said you could do\nit if you wanted to, but\n\n35\n00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:34.799\nyou had to make sure that they\nwere unique on the router.\n\n36\n00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.384\nBut I started thinking about it,\nI was like,\n\n37\n00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:38.550\nI don't think that\nthat's necessarily true.\n\n38\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.947\nAnd the reason why is that on this\ninterfaces, you can configure so\n\n39\n00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:45.234\nmany IP addresses on an interface\nthat doesn't really matter.\n\n40\n00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:49.568\nBut what has to happen though is that you\njust have to make sure that each one of\n\n41\n00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:52.960\nthese interfaces is connected\nto a different link.\n\n42\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.513\nSo in theory, this FE80 here,\nthis link local address,\n\n43\n00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.870\ncan be identical to this other one and\nit still work.\n\n44\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.590\nWhereas in IP version 4,\nyou do a duplicate address on two\n\n45\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.440\ndifferent interfaces, it tells you,\nnope, it can't do it.\n\n46\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.940\nIt's not gonna allow you to.\n\n47\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.670\nSo I said all right, let me try this out.\n\n48\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.250\nSo I started the configuration and then I\nrealized, there is another configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.870\nThat we have to at least address here,\nokay?\n\n50\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.341\nWhich is the IP version 6\nlink local address, and\n\n51\n00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:27.045\nthat's because at the end of you trying to\ntype in the new link local address here,\n\n52\n00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:32.275\nwell, you simply have to use that\nkeyword as well, which is link-local.\n\n53\n00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:34.232\nSo I went ahead and typed that in, and\n\n54\n00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:37.730\nthen I started to type in a different\naddress and I said all right.\n\n55\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.842\nSo that's fine and that works for me and\n\n56\n00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:44.196\nthis is when I started thing I don't know\nif that's actually necessarily true.\n\n57\n00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.015\nSo I started typing it in and\n\n58\n00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:51.270\nI put the IP addresses in terms of\nlink local address as being identical.\n\n59\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.428\nAnd now Daniel on both of those interfaces\nyou'll notice on the link local they\n\n60\n00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:59.278\nare identical, because it only\nmatters actually link the link, okay?\n\n61\n00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:03.500\nSo even if they're exact same on this\nrouter, it doesn't matter because as long\n\n62\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.296\nas those interfaces are tied\nto a different network,\n\n63\n00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:08.950\nit's fine, they'll communicate just fine.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n64\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.137\n&gt;&gt; So I just wanted to make sure I\n\n65\n00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:13.703\nclarified that, cuz somebody's gonna tell\nyou like, it accepted perfectly fine.\n\n66\n00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:16.330\nI was like I knew as soon as I, I was like\nsomething is not sitting exactly right\n\n67\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.120\nwith me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.490\n&gt;&gt; But I wanted to point that out before\n\n69\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.600\nwe went on in that configuration.\n\n70\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.880\nBut still if I'm doing this it's\nbecause I want the control.\n\n71\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.626\nIt is pretty much what it is normally.\n\n72\n00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:30.490\nI would probably leave it alone, I'd\nnever look at it again, but here we are.\n\n73\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.850\nSo now we're ready to\ndo some verification.\n\n74\n00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.404\nNow, for us,\nI'm gonna go back to NYEDGE here.\n\n75\n00:03:36.404 --> 00:03:41.354\nThis is the central router that we've\nbeen working on that is connecting to two\n\n76\n00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.260\ndifferent networks, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.817\nSo from this point let's do\nsome simple verification and\n\n78\n00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:49.570\nwe can actually use\na little ping to help us.\n\n79\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.340\nNow it used to be where it\nrequired you to type in\n\n80\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.260\nlike ping six is what it\nused to require you to do.\n\n81\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.395\nBut today ping works just fine.\n\n82\n00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:01.128\nSo now if I do a ping 2001 a 0 1,\n\n83\n00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:06.480\nI know that on the other\nside if NY1 here is actually\n\n84\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.620\nthe 2 address if I remember\ncorrectly there it is, 2.\n\n85\n00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.050\nI was looking I was like that\ndoesn't look right okay?\n\n86\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.278\nSo do I need to type in the prefix\nnotation as well or the prefix mask?\n\n87\n00:04:20.278 --> 00:04:22.969\nWell let's see at this\npoint at what we have.\n\n88\n00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:23.920\nWell there we go.\n\n89\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.810\nSo I didn't even have to worry\nabout typing in the prefix.\n\n90\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.490\nIt just said all right there you know it\nis ready and we are actually able to go.\n\n91\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.920\nSo we just verified that now,\nwe have that information and\n\n92\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.881\nthat we can actually ping there.\n\n93\n00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:41.767\nNow of course we need to do\n\n94\n00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:46.887\nthe other side of my NYEDGE\n\n95\n00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:52.706\nhere which is to ping 2001\n\n96\n00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:57.143\n:a:0:3::1.\n\n97\n00:04:57.143 --> 00:05:01.440\nLet's verify, and we know that that one\nis actually up and successful as well.\n\n98\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.351\nSo everything is actually good in terms of\nthe verification that we need to go on and\n\n99\n00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:09.283\neverything is happening\nthe way that we want to.\n\n100\n00:05:09.283 --> 00:05:11.880\nIP version six is a little\nbit unusual now, okay.\n\n101\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.340\nSo everything I should ping fine and\nthat's good.\n\n102\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.881\nThat's what we want to do.\n\n103\n00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:19.360\nBut some of the other things that\ncan happen just by accident.\n\n104\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.140\nSo on troubleshooting,\n\n105\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.240\nthis is something that we want to\nthink about as we do this, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.270\nIP version six can be a little\nbit tricky in this way.\n\n107\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.898\nWhereas, in IP version four, when you go,\nI typed in the wrong address, and\n\n108\n00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:34.923\nthen you want to correct it, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:34.923 --> 00:05:38.372\nWell, IP version six will actually allow\nyou to type in a second address, and\n\n110\n00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:41.020\nthen just pile it and\nstack it on top of the other.\n\n111\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.550\nAnd just say both of\nthem actually are fine\n\n112\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.950\non that one interface.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's crazy.\n\n113\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.570\n&gt;&gt; So one was placed\n\n114\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.640\none after the other, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.410\nAnd that's because it can support multiple\nnetworks on one interface if we needed to.\n\n116\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.660\nSo this is where, if I wanted to,\nI could actually do something.\n\n117\n00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.620\nSo let's just change this and\nsee some of the errors that can happen.\n\n118\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.317\nFor me, because of the strangeness\nin typing in these addresses,\n\n119\n00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:04.957\nmore than likely duplication of\nIP addresses is an error, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:10.102\nSo if I go back in now to our\nglobal configuration mode-\n\n121\n00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:10.862\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\n\n122\n00:06:10.862 --> 00:06:15.359\nwhen you say duplication you mean putting\nthe same IP address on one interface\n\n123\n00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:19.579\nmultiple times or the same IP address\non this interface on this router and\n\n124\n00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.073\nalso on another router?\n&gt;&gt; That's the one that I mean.\n\n125\n00:06:22.073 --> 00:06:23.748\nSorry if I was a little bit vague there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:23.748 --> 00:06:24.321\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n127\n00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:28.550\non both ends it would be the same IP\naddress instead of on the same router\n\n128\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.790\ninterface.\n\n129\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:37.760\nSo interface gigabit,\nif I can spell gigabit, ethernet 0/0.\n\n130\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.160\nNow before I do this right,\nbecause it will accept them both,\n\n131\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.720\nI want to actually make\nsure that I remove it.\n\n132\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.569\nSo usually,\nif you want to replace an IP address,\n\n133\n00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.438\nyou definitely have to do the no\nIP version six address, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:54.430\nNow, here's a funny thing, right?\n\n135\n00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.859\nOn the exam, they are going to make\nyou type out the entire address of\n\n136\n00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.449\ncourse if you wanted to\nactually remove this address.\n\n137\n00:07:06.116 --> 00:07:08.660\nWait, it was, that was right.\n\n138\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.160\nI was trying to remember, yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.620\nSo if I remember right,\nhere's the actual address, right?\n\n140\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.124\nSo on this one,\nthat's what they would make you type out.\n\n141\n00:07:18.124 --> 00:07:21.402\nBut in reality, you can actually\njust type in no IPv6 address, and\n\n142\n00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:23.031\nit will remove it as well.\n&gt;&gt; That's nice.\n\n143\n00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:24.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But on the exam,\n\n144\n00:07:24.597 --> 00:07:26.920\nyou can do with this one, right.\n\n145\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.521\nSo that will actually remove\nthe address and let's verify that.\n\n146\n00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:38.628\nShow IPv6, IPv6 I got to-\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n147\n00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:40.315\n&gt;&gt; Interface brief now I was about to type\n\n148\n00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:40.900\nin IP again.\n\n149\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.643\nI was like crap that's not right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:07:43.643 --> 00:07:45.710\n&gt;&gt; So now notice that on ethernet zero\n\n151\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.075\nit's actually unassigned\nboth of these IP addresses.\n\n152\n00:07:49.075 --> 00:07:53.402\nSo even though I had a link local on it,\nnotice that it actually did go ahead and\n\n153\n00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:57.129\nactually just even take away the link\nlocal as well as the IP address\n\n154\n00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:58.342\nthat we put in there.\n\n155\n00:07:58.342 --> 00:08:00.656\nSo now let's go ahead and configure it for\n\n156\n00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:04.240\nthe same thing that we have on\nthe other side, which is NYWAN1.\n\n157\n00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.104\nIf I go back into global configure,\n\n158\n00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:15.763\nConfigure terminal and\n\n159\n00:08:15.763 --> 00:08:22.061\nthen interface gigabitthernet\n\n160\n00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:28.125\nEthernet 0/0 IPv6 address\n\n161\n00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:35.828\n2001:a:0:1::2/64.\n\n162\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.333\nNow notice I am starting to get something\nin my sys log that came across here\n\n163\n00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:44.610\nthen, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.260\nSo when you see this the great thing\nis it tells you right away, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.290\nUnlike IP version 4 which will\njust kind of erase it for\n\n166\n00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.610\nyou if you do this, if you happen to\ntype this in wrong, in other words,\n\n167\n00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.870\nif you're doing this quickly and\nyou type in the same address, it tells you\n\n168\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.640\nright away that you've just done this,\nand that it's not going to work.\n\n169\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.280\nND is for neighbor discovery, right?\n\n170\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.180\nSo you're seeing this %IPV6,\nND is neighbor discovery,\n\n171\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.720\nthis is a message level for\nyour sys long messages of four,\n\n172\n00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.360\nthat's telling you it's\na duplicate in that information.\n\n173\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.080\nAnd it says the duplicate information and\n\n174\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.630\nit also says on the other\ninterface that its connected to.\n\n175\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.190\nSo its quite a bit of information and\nthe sys log message that you\n\n176\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.635\nget which is a little bit its nice because\nit will let you know right away, like\n\n177\n00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:35.505\nI shouldn't have done that on the other\nend, I'll probably have to reconfigure for\n\n178\n00:09:35.505 --> 00:09:37.925\nthis end.\n&gt;&gt; So it's not allowing you or\n\n179\n00:09:37.925 --> 00:09:38.995\nit will allow you to?\n\n180\n00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:39.565\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I just want\n\n181\n00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:40.135\nto be clear.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:44.205\nNo, you can put it in, but\nit's not going to do anything for you.\n\n183\n00:09:44.205 --> 00:09:47.300\nIt won't sent it cause if you'd say,hey,\nhere's the destination it's going to,\n\n184\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.520\nit's going to see its own address and\nsend it to loop back,\n\n185\n00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.100\nand it's going to come back.\n&gt;&gt; So here we get the error letting you\n\n186\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.690\nknow, hey buddy you might want to re-think\nwhatever that it is you're doing and\n\n187\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.400\nmake sure that you have, because then you\nrun into what Ryan was talking about.\n\n188\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.150\nI'm just going to send stuff to myself,\nbecause that's who I think I am.\n\n189\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.209\nI'm having a real personality\ndisorder at this point.\n\n190\n00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:08.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and that's a problem.\n\n191\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.960\nIn a lot of ways that's a problem.\n\n192\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.849\nRight here-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n193\n00:10:10.849 --> 00:10:14.750\nit's kind of a funny [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never mind about the.\n\n194\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.670\nSo yeah, here we go.\n\n195\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.450\nSo on Gigabitethenet0,\nit does allow you to assign it but\n\n196\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.590\nit's not gonna really work for you.\n\n197\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.520\nIt is giving you a nice message just\nabout immediately after it solved.\n\n198\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.430\nSo you know that this\nis an active interface.\n\n199\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.110\nEverything is really working fast and\ndoing everything else that needs to, but\n\n200\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.250\nadding in that duplicate\ninformation will do that.\n\n201\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.430\nNow the strange thing is,\non the other side.\n\n202\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.030\nIf I go to NYWAN here instead.\n\n203\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.080\nLet me see if I can get access\ninto this thing too as well.\n\n204\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.760\nI was hoping that, of course it timed out,\n\n205\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.150\nthat we would actually see\nthe message on the other side.\n\n206\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.260\nIt even has a confirmation on both sides,\n\n207\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.910\nso as soon as it's done, it gives you\nanother piece of information, too.\n\n208\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.760\nAnd there is a protocol, right,\n\n209\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.010\ncalled DAD which is duplicate\naddress discovery that happens.\n\n210\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.550\nSo the other side says ND,\nwhich is network discovery.\n\n211\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.640\nWhen you programmed it\nthen on that side and\n\n212\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.020\nthere was a duplicate on this\nside responding side and\n\n213\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.640\nit's gonna say DAD instead of ND duplicate\naddress discovery message, go figure.\n\n214\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.290\nTo me that's the amazing thing, right,\n\n215\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.570\nis that somebody said we\ndon't need the same message,\n\n216\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.950\nwe actually need them to know that This\nside discovered the duplicate, okay.\n\n217\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.730\nSo and\n\n218\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.050\nwhereas the other side says the network\nis telling you that this is a duplicate.\n\n219\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.350\nSo it's kinda neat that\nsomebody had that foresight\n\n220\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.980\nto realize that here's how you determine\nwhether you just configured a duplicate or\n\n221\n00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.360\nwhether somebody duplicated you.\n\n222\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.610\nSo it really is helpful\nin sending information\n\n223\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.570\nMessaging that we end up seeing there too,\nokay?\n\n224\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.860\nSo let's go ahead and change that back for\na little bit here, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.360\nBut besides that there really isn't\nmuch in terms of troubleshooting.\n\n226\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.050\nRemember typing in the IP address wrong is\nprobably the big thing that can happen.\n\n227\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.060\nOn link locals,\nyou can have them duplicate.\n\n228\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.230\nIt doesn't matter on the single router,\nthat can be duplicated.\n\n229\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.940\nBut if you're actually between two links,\nthe IP address should not be the same, and\n\n230\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.900\nthat is another one here, all right.\n\n231\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.440\nSo let me get back to\nthe state that it needs to be.\n\n232\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.300\nI think we're actually, actually\nlet me just remove the IP address.\n\n233\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.230\nAnd now that will actually\nend up working instead.\n\n234\n00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:36.593\nLet me go into configure terminal and\nwe'll get into interface.\n\n235\n00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:41.264\nWhy can't I spell interface?\n\n236\n00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:43.836\nGigabit.\n&gt;&gt; It's very hard.\n\n237\n00:12:43.836 --> 00:12:46.045\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ethernet.\n\n238\n00:12:46.045 --> 00:12:48.640\n0/0 here.\n\n239\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.320\nAnd now I want to just\nremove the IP address.\n\n240\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:57.270\nSo let me see if I can show you\nwhat I mean, no ipv6 addresss,\n\n241\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:02.650\nI press that And now I'm gonna kinda\ngive you a little secret one too.\n\n242\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.680\nNow this one you won't see on the exam.\n\n243\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.040\nYou know how we've been typing in exit to\nget all the way out to the privIleged EXEC\n\n244\n00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.870\nmode?\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n\n245\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.440\n&gt;&gt; There are some shortcuts that you can\n\n246\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.130\nuse that will allow you run those same\ncommands that you can run in the show\n\n247\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.010\nmode and that privileged EXEC mode, but\nyou'll probably see this beginning with\n\n248\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.280\nthe CCNA routing and switching\nbecause they do emphasize it there.\n\n249\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.100\nNot so much at this stage here.\n\n250\n00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.771\nBut if you're tired like I am of kind of\ngoing in and out of those interfaces here,\n\n251\n00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:34.904\nyou can type in the word do, and\nthen I can do show ip, ipv6,\n\n252\n00:13:34.904 --> 00:13:41.270\nsorry, ipv6 interface brief, if I could\nspell brief, which I can't, all right.\n\n253\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.730\nAnd now that allow me to do that.\n\n254\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.690\nSo remember that before I told you you\nprobably have to type out the full IP\n\n255\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.560\nversion 6 address to get rid of it?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n256\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.800\n&gt;&gt; I just typed in no IPv6 address and\n\n257\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.480\nit unassigned it anyway, yeah.\n\n258\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.990\nSo in reality it will let you do it.\n\n259\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.410\nOn the exam, make sure you type it out,\n&gt;&gt; Trust but verify.\n\n260\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.762\n&gt;&gt; Is the [CROSSTALK] yeah, trust but\n\n261\n00:14:00.762 --> 00:14:02.315\nverify is pretty much the key, okay.\n\n262\n00:14:02.315 --> 00:14:05.825\nNow the last thing that we're doing for\nthis portion, okay,\n\n263\n00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:08.930\nis we've talked about when\nwe did the intro for IPv6,\n\n264\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:13.990\nthat everything we've been doing right\nnow Daniel, is static configuration.\n\n265\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.180\nSo Daniel, how many IPv6 addresses\nwould you like to type in on\n\n266\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.010\nnetwork?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with as few as humanly\n\n267\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.130\npossible.\n&gt;&gt; As few as humanly possible.\n\n268\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.440\nOkay so I like that idea as well.\n\n269\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.640\nSo the great thing is there is\nwhat is called auto configuration.\n\n270\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.350\nTechnically, it's called slack\nis what it's called right.\n\n271\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Hey we use slack.\n\n272\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well it's not\n\n273\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.560\nthat same type of slack.\n&gt;&gt; Aw.\n\n274\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.710\nThis one is S-L-A-A-C [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be pronounced differently.\n\n275\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.362\n&gt;&gt; SLAAC.\n\n276\n00:14:42.362 --> 00:14:44.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n277\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.170\nso this one is a little bit different,\nwhich stands for stateless.\n\n278\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.610\nI don't know why, but\nthe L gets put in there.\n\n279\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.830\nStateless Automatic Address Configuration,\nor\n\n280\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.160\nStateless Address Automatic Configuration\none does two,\n\n281\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.110\nI should be able to tell you exactly.\n\n282\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.810\nStateless address auto-configuration.\n\n283\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.390\nThose two as kill me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n284\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.360\n&gt;&gt; I probably said it\n\n285\n00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.330\nwrong every single time I've said it.\n\n286\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.980\nBut just kinda get the idea.\n\n287\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.110\nWhat does that mean?\n\n288\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.520\nLet's make sure we review this, Dan, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.990\nStatic means what?\n\n290\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.160\nWe type it in.\n\n291\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.280\nHow fun does that sound, Daniel?\n&gt;&gt; Zero fun,\n\n292\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.100\nsir.\n&gt;&gt; Zero\n\n293\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.630\nfun.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.390\n&gt;&gt; That's the same thing.\n\n295\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.950\nEvery time you're like, you're watching me\ntry to do this, I'm so used to typing in\n\n296\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.730\nthat 192 dot that it's like colon, colon.\n\n297\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Colon.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.430\nIt doesn't seem to watch.\n\n299\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:35.480\nBut on stateless auto,\nthe address auto-configuration,\n\n300\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.610\nit says, look,\nget at least one IP address.\n\n301\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.870\nWell let's just do it one.\n&gt;&gt; One, one, uno.\n\n302\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay?\n\n303\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.540\nType in 1, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.950\nOnce you type in 1,\nwe can do the rest, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.540\nThat's pretty darn good.\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n306\n00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that idea actually sounds really\n\n307\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.531\ngood, okay?\n\n308\n00:15:52.531 --> 00:15:55.670\nOverall, so when we do that\nwhat is that actually saying?\n\n309\n00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.618\nThat's saying we will use\na combination of messages And\n\n310\n00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:03.314\nwhat will happen here\nwithout a DHCP server, okay?\n\n311\n00:16:03.314 --> 00:16:10.640\nRemember in IPv4 DHCP server says, hey,\nI love to hand out IP addresses, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.556\nWell, in IPv6 you can set one up sure,\nokay?\n\n313\n00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:19.810\nBut Taylor says, you don't have to\nset it up, all you need is a router.\n\n314\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.690\nThat has one IP address on it,\nit's all you need, okay?\n\n315\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.160\nOnce you do that,\nI can configure the rest of\n\n316\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.020\nall the other things that are connected to\nthis interface if you want me to, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.940\nSo it can do something like that and\n\n318\n00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.430\nthe way it does it is by using two\ndifferent message types, right?\n\n319\n00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.850\nThere is one message type that is\ncalled a RS, which is a router\n\n320\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:47.710\nsolicitation message and then there's also\nan RA, which is a router advertisement.\n\n321\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.300\nSo what happens in this particular\ntime is that we need to configure\n\n322\n00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.630\ndevices then that will send out\nrouter solicitation messages.\n\n323\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.311\nAnd essentially the router solicitation\nmessage is very similar to what we\n\n324\n00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.477\nsee in the door of process of DHCP.\n\n325\n00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:05.960\nNow, you're saying,\nI don't know what the door process is.\n\n326\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.170\nWell, this is where you'll just\nhave to trust me for right now.\n\n327\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.580\nWe've still got some network management\nconcepts, that we'll be covering in\n\n328\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:19.180\nthe future, but it's actually is what\nanswers those types of messages, okay?\n\n329\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.968\nA router solicitation message just put it\ndown there on that network link that says,\n\n330\n00:17:24.968 --> 00:17:28.630\nl need IPv6 addressing information, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.976\nI am soliciting for\nthat information from a router, and\n\n332\n00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:34.050\nthat's what it's doing, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.950\nNow, that type of message that goes out is\nactually a special type of transmission\n\n334\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.200\ntowards a special type of address\ncalled an anycast address as well.\n\n335\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.030\nAnd it goes to the nearest router,\nin terms of the routing protocols and\n\n336\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:47.900\nthe way that it does.\n\n337\n00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.480\nIt goes to the nearest one, which means\nI'm gonna actually select the router\n\n338\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.615\nthat's on my land, is what it's gonna do.\n\n339\n00:17:52.615 --> 00:17:57.240\nFrom that point, the router will then go,\nhey, I hear that message here.\n\n340\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.880\nLet me send out an RA,\nwhich is a router advertisement, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.100\nNow before any of that stuff happens, and\n\n342\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.570\nthat we can actually do\nsomething like this here.\n\n343\n00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.580\nThere are a couple of things that have\nto happen when this is done, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.090\nIn these types of messages and for those\nthat are also getting configured to do\n\n345\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:23.720\nthe idea of slack here there are two\nflags that you'll have to know about.\n\n346\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.996\nAnd you don't have to worry about what\nbits that they are at this point, and\n\n347\n00:18:26.996 --> 00:18:27.628\neverything.\n\n348\n00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:32.296\nBut you wanna remember that there's two\nflags that need to be set, in this way,\n\n349\n00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:36.836\nback to a state of zero, if I remember\ncorrectly, if I'm telling you right.\n\n350\n00:18:36.836 --> 00:18:39.310\nYeah, that's exactly what happens.\n\n351\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:44.610\nAll right, now when that happens,\nthe router advertisement,\n\n352\n00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:49.060\nit sends out a message in which these\ntwo flags, one's called the managed\n\n353\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.870\nconfiguration and the other one is\ncalled the other configuration.\n\n354\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.250\nThose are the two flags,\nthey're set to zero.\n\n355\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.250\nIf your machine or whatever is on the\nother end isn't set to zero, it just says,\n\n356\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.520\nI've already got a configuration on this.\n\n357\n00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.920\nSo don't hand it to me.\n\n358\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.650\nDon't give me anything, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.378\nIn other words,\nif your machines are already set,\n\n360\n00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:12.750\nwhy does it need another address\nfrom a router advertisement?\n\n361\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.240\nIt doesn't, so that's the idea, okay?\n\n362\n00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.820\nSo we need to make sure that then\non the interface that we have,\n\n363\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.380\nwhich is gonna be the one that I just\ntook the IP address off, that we set that\n\n364\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.540\nparticular interface now to make\nsure that those flags are set to 0.\n\n365\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.620\nRemember that the other end of this\nconfiguration here on NYEDGE, right?\n\n366\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.760\nIs connected to this NYWAN1 here.\n\n367\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:40.220\nSo if I now go back into the interface\nconfiguration at this point, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.960\nI want to make sure that I turn off\nany possible flag configurations here.\n\n369\n00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.037\nSo I can type in no IPv6 ND for\n\n370\n00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:55.058\nneighbor discovery or\n\n371\n00:19:55.058 --> 00:20:03.270\nnetwork discovery managed config flag.\n\n372\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.327\nThat would turn that one off,\n\n373\n00:20:07.327 --> 00:20:12.844\nanother setting, and back to 0 a nd then\n\n374\n00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:17.758\nno ipv6 nd other-config-flag.\n\n375\n00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:21.110\nSo that gets this router setup and\nready for\n\n376\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:27.000\nthose addresses to be able to get\nhanded out at this point as we do this.\n\n377\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.450\nMake sure I've got that one\nthe way that I want to, right.\n\n378\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.730\nAll right, so\nnow that we have that ready to go,\n\n379\n00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.148\nwe now want to set up the way that\nit's gonna receive an address.\n\n380\n00:20:44.148 --> 00:20:50.780\nSo IPv6 address, and this time I'm\ngonna use the question mark so\n\n381\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.820\nthat we can see some of the different\nways that we can set up IP addresses.\n\n382\n00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.605\nYou and I have been doing,\nsorry, this one here,\n\n383\n00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:03.230\n[LAUGH] we've been setting\nup global unicast addresses.\n\n384\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.140\nI went ahead and in the break in between,\nI setup a link local address as well so\n\n385\n00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.440\nwe've been doing that one.\n\n386\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.354\nBut this time we're gonna go for this\none which is the auto config to obtain\n\n387\n00:21:13.354 --> 00:21:16.855\nan IP address using\nthe auto-configuration here.\n\n388\n00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:21.280\nIs what we want to make sure that\nwe're actually doing here, okay?\n\n389\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.580\nNow, the other thing I'm\ntrying to remember actually,\n\n390\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.265\nnow I'm trying to decide whether or\nnot this is going to work,\n\n391\n00:21:28.265 --> 00:21:31.860\ncuz I think I might have setup that\nflag configuration on the wrong side.\n\n392\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.130\nI might need to set it up on this side.\n\n393\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.030\nYeah, the router advertisement, sorry,\nI have done this backward here.\n\n394\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.660\nLet me go back to NYWAN, here.\n\n395\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.810\nSo the messages that I just set up here,\nit doesn't hurt anything, okay?\n\n396\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.150\nBut it's because I need\nthe address from here,\n\n397\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.378\nthat I need to send that out\nwithout those configurations there.\n\n398\n00:21:49.378 --> 00:21:53.114\nSo let me get the NYWAN here,\nthat's my fault for\n\n399\n00:21:53.114 --> 00:21:59.250\nnot paying attention until I looked\ndown here, configure terminal.\n\n400\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:06.559\nAnd we'll do the same thing,\ninterface gigabyteEthernet\n\n401\n00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:13.522\n0/0 and then no IPv6 ND\n\n402\n00:22:13.522 --> 00:22:21.740\nmanaged-config-flag, I was doing\nit on the wrong interface.\n\n403\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.948\nNo ipv6 ND, this is other,\n\n404\n00:22:26.948 --> 00:22:31.524\nother-config-flag.\n\n405\n00:22:31.524 --> 00:22:35.070\nRight, so that should be fine and\n\n406\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.160\nnow I can go back to EDGE and\nnow we can configure the IP address.\n\n407\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.025\nYou have to do it on the side that\nissues the router advertisement.\n\n408\n00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:45.877\nIn my mind had just kind of gotten\nsquarely since I just talked about router\n\n409\n00:22:45.877 --> 00:22:48.800\nsolicitations.\n&gt;&gt; We'll forgive you this time, Ronnie.\n\n410\n00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.680\n&gt;&gt; It happens, okay,\n\n411\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.640\nbut the great thing is your\nlab guy should be right.\n\n412\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.420\nIt is what it should be, okay?\n\n413\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.410\nSo here we are now ready.\n\n414\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:00.470\nSo I'm gonna do IPv6 address and\nthen auto-config, okay?\n\n415\n00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:07.570\nSo once I do IPv6 address auto-config,\nthat now enables for\n\n416\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.170\nslack to happen and\ndo what we need to do as well.\n\n417\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.970\nNow at this point,\nI'm just gonna give it a moment,\n\n418\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.630\ncuz it does take just a moment,\nfor the router solicitation and\n\n419\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.590\nthe advertisements to go back and\nforth in between.\n\n420\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.380\nAnd once that's done here,\nthen I should be\n\n421\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.813\nable to type in show IPv6\n\n422\n00:23:30.813 --> 00:23:37.040\ninterface brief.\n\n423\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.130\nAnd now look, Daniel,\n\n424\n00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.210\nwe had just removed that IP address,\nnow we take a look and there it is.\n\n425\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.085\nThere's the global unicast address again,\nand\n\n426\n00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:50.991\nnotice at the very beginning we said that\nwe would leave the first 48 bits alone and\n\n427\n00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:52.239\nthere it is.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n428\n00:23:52.239 --> 00:23:54.232\n&gt;&gt; So instead of this being a one,\n\n429\n00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:57.838\nwhich originally it was when\nwe statically typed it in,\n\n430\n00:23:57.838 --> 00:24:01.672\nit now ended up putting instead its,\nMac address in place,\n\n431\n00:24:01.672 --> 00:24:07.590\nalong with adding in the 16 bits right in\nthe middle, which gave us that 64 bits.\n\n432\n00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.390\nSo there it is.\n\n433\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.800\nIt automatically added in this IP\naddress into that interface for us, so\n\n434\n00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.580\nnow we don't have to configure everything.\n&gt;&gt; That's very cool,\n\n435\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.422\nRonnie, that's-\n&gt;&gt; It is-\n\n436\n00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:16.922\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n437\n00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:17.715\n&gt;&gt; Really cool,\n\n438\n00:24:17.715 --> 00:24:22.284\nbecause this actually is great.\nIt really does make the configuration\n\n439\n00:24:22.284 --> 00:24:26.367\na lot less controlling but\nit makes it work very quickly.\n\n440\n00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:27.585\n&gt;&gt; Well, and also,\n\n441\n00:24:27.585 --> 00:24:32.390\nit keeps us from making mistakes.\nWe're having a lot less hands on and\n\n442\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.800\nas you've seen our hands on-\n&gt;&gt; No, mine are terrible.\n\n443\n00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n444\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:36.780\nAnd we're all that way, right?\n\n445\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.029\nCan mistype something.\n\n446\n00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:40.448\nThe more I can let the computer\ndo it programmatically,\n\n447\n00:24:40.448 --> 00:24:42.210\nthe less likely there is to be a problem.\n\n448\n00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.510\nSo very, very cool.\n\n449\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.490\nI like that kind of stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel,\n\n450\n00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.310\nthe neat thing is IP version 4 will work\n\n451\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.910\ndirectly on top of this as well.\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n452\n00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Now let's do this.\n\n453\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.810\nLet me do something here.\n\n454\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.779\nLet me do a show running-config.\n\n455\n00:24:58.181 --> 00:25:01.822\nWait, I'm inside the interface right now.\n\n456\n00:25:01.822 --> 00:25:06.380\nI was actually where I need\nto be finally [LAUGH] funny,\n\n457\n00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:12.209\nhere show running-config.\n&gt;&gt; They should put a little map,\n\n458\n00:25:12.209 --> 00:25:13.174\nsays you are here.\n\n459\n00:25:13.174 --> 00:25:16.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now look here,\n\n460\n00:25:16.587 --> 00:25:21.283\nDaniel, and look at the interfaces right\nhere, the ones that we just configured on\n\n461\n00:25:21.283 --> 00:25:22.750\nthis router.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n462\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.160\n&gt;&gt; Notice it has both IP version 4 and\n\n463\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.245\nIP version 6s on them, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So now I can use either one Whatever\n\n464\n00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:33.805\nnetwork I attach to, if it's IPv4 and so\nwe're on that, cool, I'm connected but if\n\n465\n00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:37.640\nit's IPv6, I'm connected to that as well.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the only place, in theory,\n\n466\n00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.642\nright,\n&gt;&gt; In theory.\n\n467\n00:25:38.642 --> 00:25:40.044\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which we should note.\n\n468\n00:25:40.044 --> 00:25:42.292\nWe should see this for\na period of time but\n\n469\n00:25:42.292 --> 00:25:46.460\nwe shouldn't see it as a permanent\nsolution because the goal of what we're\n\n470\n00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.210\nseeing right here is called\na transitional technology.\n\n471\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.538\nIt's called six to, not six to four,\nit's called dual stack.\n\n472\n00:25:52.538 --> 00:25:54.081\nThat's what it's called.\n&gt;&gt; Dual stack.\n\n473\n00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:54.911\n&gt;&gt; Dual stack, okay?\n\n474\n00:25:54.911 --> 00:25:59.997\nSo this allows us to say if my network\nis transitioning from IP version 4 to IP\n\n475\n00:25:59.997 --> 00:26:05.170\nversion 6, let me go ahead and configure\nthe router to work on IP version 4.\n\n476\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.030\nThen let me put the IP version\n6 router's information on it.\n\n477\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.022\nTest it, verify that it works and\n\n478\n00:26:12.022 --> 00:26:15.863\nonce everything is working the way\nthat I think it should be, and\n\n479\n00:26:15.863 --> 00:26:20.366\nI start getting machines on it, yup,\nthen you just turn off IP version 4.\n\n480\n00:26:20.366 --> 00:26:21.400\nAnd you are ready to go.\n&gt;&gt; Ready to work.\n\n481\n00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:21.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n482\n00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.750\nhopefully everything does work.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n483\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.560\n&gt;&gt; So but that's the goal, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.550\nBut we shouldn't see it\non there permanently.\n\n485\n00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.890\nNow will people leave it permanent?\n\n486\n00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.940\nProbably.\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n487\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.080\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it.\n\n488\n00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.060\n&gt;&gt; When people say,\n\n489\n00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.410\nwell it's not permanent.\n\n490\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.020\nIt's only been on there for\nthe last ten years.\n\n491\n00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.940\nWe will eventually be IPv6 only.\n\n492\n00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n493\n00:26:39.073 --> 00:26:42.210\nbut just remember if you see that\nterm dual stacked, it really is.\n\n494\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.450\nIt's what's called\na transitional technology.\n\n495\n00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.915\nSo even though it can work and\n\n496\n00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:49.058\nyou're seeing it work right here,\nit's not supposed to be something that is\n\n497\n00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:49.830\npermanent.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n498\n00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.507\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel, for\n\n499\n00:26:50.507 --> 00:26:53.788\nus we have a lot of different ways to\nkinda really get out of some of the issues\n\n500\n00:26:53.788 --> 00:26:55.523\nthat IP version 6 is going to cause us.\n\n501\n00:26:55.523 --> 00:26:59.010\nThe great thing is it doesn't have\nanything that really breaks, right?\n\n502\n00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.410\nFor us, it's really about configuring\nit correctly is kind of the key.\n\n503\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.770\nTurning on and off the interfaces to make\nsure that we get them ready to go and\n\n504\n00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.580\nif they're matching or if they're\nactually exactly what they need to be,\n\n505\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.300\nit works perfectly fine.\n\n506\n00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.768\nSo that's why we only spent very little\ntime in the troubleshooting cuz there's\n\n507\n00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:18.726\nreally not a lot, except for\nthe stuff that we would have showed you,\n\n508\n00:27:18.726 --> 00:27:20.873\neven an IP version 4 that\nyou can translate over.\n\n509\n00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:23.884\nThe key word to remember here,\nand the difference, right,\n\n510\n00:27:23.884 --> 00:27:26.970\nis when you start typing in commands,\nmake sure it's IPv6.\n\n511\n00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.990\nLook at that, get it memorized.\n\n512\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.740\nIf you see where it shows you when you get\ninto the interface and you get a command\n\n513\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.910\nthere, and\nyou see an answer that says IP address,\n\n514\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:43.030\nand shows you an IP version 6 address,\nthat is gonna be wrong, okay?\n\n515\n00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:47.000\nSo even if it looks 100% right,\nread it and make sure.\n\n516\n00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.180\nThen if the next one says, IPv6 and\n\n517\n00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.030\nthen the right IPv6 address there,\nthen that's the right one.\n\n518\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.740\nIt's tricky, okay?\n\n519\n00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.820\nDon't just go,\nI don't care which one it is.\n\n520\n00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.920\nIt matters, okay?\n\n521\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.130\nAnd don't forget that Unicast AS route,\nIPv6 Unicast AS routing.\n\n522\n00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:08.280\nPay attention, make sure you get those\nshow commands that we just showed you.\n\n523\n00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.185\nDon't depend on the show\nrun as much as you can.\n\n524\n00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:14.325\nYou are gonna see it, but\ndon't depend on that.\n\n525\n00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:17.235\nThat is kind of the easy way\nto get through everything.\n\n526\n00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:20.179\nAnd I guarantee, on Cisco,\nwhen you're trying to do it quickly,\n\n527\n00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:23.648\nthat is the least way that they want you\nto go because that takes the most time for\n\n528\n00:28:23.648 --> 00:28:26.455\nyou to filter through all of\nthe stuff that you see right there.\n\n529\n00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:30.136\nSo right now,\nthat should actually end for us here,\n\n530\n00:28:30.136 --> 00:28:34.052\nthe IP version 6 lab that we have.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, great stuff Ronnie.\n\n531\n00:28:34.052 --> 00:28:37.342\nThank you so much for explaining IPV 6,\nhow to get it configured,\n\n532\n00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:39.972\nhow to get it working, and\nall of the pitfalls and\n\n533\n00:28:39.972 --> 00:28:43.382\ncaveats that we might have to look out for\nas we do that very thing.\n\n534\n00:28:43.382 --> 00:28:45.160\nSo thank you for\njoining us again, Ronnie, and\n\n535\n00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.592\nwe do thank you as well for joining us.\n\n536\n00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:48.520\nHopefully you've enjoyed this episode.\n\n537\n00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.680\nThere will be more to come.\n\n538\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.310\nAs for this one though,\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n539\n00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.850\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n540\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.700\n&gt;&gt; And I’m Ronnie Wong.\n\n541\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.666\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n542\n00:28:55.666 --> 00:29:02.490\n[MUSIC]\n\n543\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.422\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.308\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:12.577\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:17.080\ngreetings everyone, welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.033\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.152\nwe're continuing on with more of\nthat good old CCENT that you love so\n\n8\n00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:23.840\nmuch.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.282\n&gt;&gt; Joining us back in the studio, yet\n\n10\n00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:28.290\nagain lending his expertise for us,\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.143\nRonnie, glad to have you back,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:32.182\n&gt;&gt; It is going well Daniel, thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:36.197\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non with learning more, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:38.830\ngetting ready for that Cisco CCENT exam.\n\n15\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.610\nAnd today we're gonna take a look at just\nsome troubleshooting methodologies, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.960\nshow you how they can be applied as well.\n\n17\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.419\nSo we have to, of course,\ntalk about some of the basics, and\n\n18\n00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:48.931\nthe foundational theory behind it.\n\n19\n00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:52.510\nBut then we're going to show you just\na brief lab that we also have inside of\n\n20\n00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.352\nPractice Labs that you'll be\nable to follow right along.\n\n21\n00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:59.630\nAnd I may kind of not do every single step\ncuz sometimes I forget what the steps are,\n\n22\n00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.488\neven though I have right here, what\nends up happening is I kind of forget.\n\n23\n00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:04.066\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.344\n&gt;&gt; But you'll be able to follow\n\n25\n00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:08.227\nevery single step exactly the way\nthat they've planned it out.\n\n26\n00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:11.766\nSo just pay attention as we go\nthrough that part as well as this.\n\n27\n00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.469\nBecause there's gonna be\nquestions on whether or\n\n28\n00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.040\nnot you actually have the idea of\nunderstanding troubleshooting now, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.165\nSo Daniel, let's just talk\nbasically about troubleshooting at\n\n30\n00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:26.093\nthe beginning of our IT\ncareers just a moment.\n\n31\n00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:29.830\nSo Daniel, I remember when I first\nreally started getting at that.\n\n32\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.302\nI'd take a look at a machine,\nit would stop working, I'd go-\n\n33\n00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:33.157\n&gt;&gt; Check the oil and\n\n34\n00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:36.801\nthe gas to make sure that [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would think, right, yeah, but\n\n35\n00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.137\nI'd just go, well,\nlet's just try this, right.\n\n36\n00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:40.863\nIt was essentially a shotgun approach,\n\n37\n00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:42.480\nwhat about you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n38\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.690\nbecause you had no real way\nto figure out where to begin.\n\n39\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.090\nSo you just began with the first\nthing you could think of.\n\n40\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.960\nOkay, maybe it's that, and you would\nattempt and see if that would fix it.\n\n41\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.450\nIf not, chuck it and try something else.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n42\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.508\nthe shotgun approach seems to kind of\nbe where most beginners kind of start.\n\n43\n00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:02.360\nIt's like, here's the body of\nknowledge that I have right now, and\n\n44\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.698\nlet's just see what sticks.\n\n45\n00:02:03.698 --> 00:02:07.387\nSo you tried something and then you're\nlike, that didn't really do anything,\n\n46\n00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.296\nand then you keep trying something else.\n\n47\n00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.029\nAnd maybe, if you're lucky,\na lot of times, or\n\n48\n00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:16.631\nif you've actually just kind of hit very\nclose, not super far off the target, but\n\n49\n00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:19.550\nclose enough where you're like, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.790\nThat gives me a result I was expecting,\nand now you can begin to troubleshoot.\n\n51\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.460\nWell Daniel, even though that is\na practical approach at the beginning,\n\n52\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.760\nthe problem is, it's a time\nwasting approach as well, right.\n\n53\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.350\nIf I have to try out let's\nsay ten solutions before I\n\n54\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.180\nget to the right solution.\n\n55\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.063\nAnd then the other problem behind it,\nright, because it takes that long is,\n\n56\n00:02:41.063 --> 00:02:42.031\nis it consistent?\n\n57\n00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.140\nSo let's say that here's what\nhappened week after week, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.270\nOne computer has a problem and\nI try it, and bam, it worked, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.510\nSecond week comes along, Daniel,\nyou tell me if you've experienced this.\n\n60\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.400\nYou try the same thing and\nyou're like, no.\n\n61\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.435\n&gt;&gt; It didn't work.\n\n62\n00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:56.140\n&gt;&gt; It didn't work, so\n\n63\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.969\nDaniel, have you had that experience too?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course,\n\n64\n00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.162\nlike you said, everybody that starts\noff just starts using whatever bits and\n\n65\n00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:06.663\npieces of knowledge they have\nto try to troubleshoot problems.\n\n66\n00:03:06.663 --> 00:03:11.169\nAnd since we're not super familiar at\nthat point with what causes what and\n\n67\n00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.575\nhaving all the conceptual knowledge.\n\n68\n00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:16.824\nAnd of course that practical knowledge,\nto be able to put it together and\n\n69\n00:03:16.824 --> 00:03:19.408\ngo, I should be seeing this,\nbecause of x, y and z.\n\n70\n00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:23.274\nThat'd be the the only reasons that\nwould happen, and helping us focus\n\n71\n00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:27.088\non [LAUGH] a specific area, we just\ntry everything in the kitchen sink.\n\n72\n00:03:27.088 --> 00:03:28.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so we're getting two things,\n\n73\n00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:30.870\nright, from that shotgun approach.\n\n74\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.580\nOne, it can waste a lot of time, and\nin a critical environment, right,\n\n75\n00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.180\nwhere you need to be up and fast, and\nquick as possible to get everything up and\n\n76\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.520\nfunctioning so that other people can do\nwork, well, that's what you can't waste.\n\n77\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.020\nAnd this is part of the realm of\nthe way that Cisco tests whether or\n\n78\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.776\nnot you've internalized that knowledge,\nand you have it.\n\n79\n00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:55.480\nThey don't really get you by asking\nquestions, at least on certification,\n\n80\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.770\nright, applying your knowledge and\neverything.\n\n81\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.060\nThey don't get you by asking very long and\ncomplex questions.\n\n82\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.909\nThey get you by just saying,\n\n83\n00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.699\nyou need to know what to do when\nyou see this type of result.\n\n84\n00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.726\nOr you need to know what\nthe next step should be so\n\n85\n00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:13.260\nthat you can get the proper\nresult that you want.\n\n86\n00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.435\nSo in that sense, that's what the shotgun\napproach really doesn't help.\n\n87\n00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:19.640\nAnd secondly, what Daniel and\n\n88\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.970\nI just described as well Is the idea\nof consistency and results.\n\n89\n00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.567\nIf I apply something one week and\nI go, all right, that fixed it, and\n\n90\n00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.000\nI think that it's come\nclose to the solution.\n\n91\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.265\nI try the same thing the next week and it\ndoesn't work, that's inconsistent results.\n\n92\n00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:39.489\nAnd Daniel, that probably might even\nbecome more of a waste of time because I\n\n93\n00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:41.145\nthink it should have worked.\n\n94\n00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:44.394\nAnd now I'm almost, I'm thinking,\nlook, it worked last week.\n\n95\n00:04:44.394 --> 00:04:50.523\nSo I hate to say this,\nit's that weird idiom, right, insanity,\n\n96\n00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:54.726\ndoing the same thing over and over again-\n&gt;&gt; Expecting different results-\n\n97\n00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:56.766\n&gt;&gt; Expecting different results, yeah,\n\n98\n00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:57.730\nwe do that.\n\n99\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.980\nWe keep going, no, it worked last time,\nlet me just reboot the computer and\n\n100\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.920\nI'll try that same thing again,\nand it still doesn't work.\n\n101\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.610\nAnd then you go, okay, well let me try and\n\n102\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.780\nturn this off and\nI'll try the same thing again.\n\n103\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.975\nNow wait a minute, you're doing\nsomething just slightly different, but\n\n104\n00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:15.690\nyou're still getting the same result, but\nyou're really only doing the same thing.\n\n105\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.990\nSo that's where the problem lies, okay,\nso shot gun approach, can it work?\n\n106\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.850\nI'm not gonna say it can't, okay,\n\n107\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.437\nthere are times when\nRonnie Wong has gotten lucky.\n\n108\n00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:27.487\nAnd once that's done,\nhere's the third issue.\n\n109\n00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:30.770\nDo I have a clue what actually fixed it?\n\n110\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.030\nDaniel, have you run across that,\nwhere you're like, okay it's working.\n\n111\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.949\nAnd you just walk away and\ngo, glad it's working.\n\n112\n00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.013\nAnd then somebody says, hey Daniel, what\ndid that fix do, you're like, [SOUND].\n\n113\n00:05:41.013 --> 00:05:43.551\n&gt;&gt; Which one of those ten things you\n\n114\n00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:48.348\ndid actually fixed the problem,\nhey, is that Elvis [LAUGH]?\n\n115\n00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.766\n&gt;&gt; That's a frustrating thing too, right,\n\n116\n00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:55.345\nbecause you can't go back and reuse that\nknowledge that you almost came up with.\n\n117\n00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:59.962\nYou're counting at that point on the very\nfact that you're gonna trend toward what's\n\n118\n00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:00.858\ngonna be right.\n\n119\n00:06:00.858 --> 00:06:02.963\nBut you don't have a clue\nwhat made that trend.\n\n120\n00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:05.145\n&gt;&gt; We need to be more scientific when it\n\n121\n00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:10.315\ncomes to coming up with our methodology\nand our actual troubleshooting solutions,\n\n122\n00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:13.560\nthat's the word I'm looking for,\nsolutions.\n\n123\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.160\nI want to be able to say yes, I did this,\nthat was the answer to this problem.\n\n124\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.600\nI can repeat this, anybody else\ncalls me with the same problem,\n\n125\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.000\nI can apply said solution and\nit will work.\n\n126\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.700\nUnderstanding that all\nthe variables were the same.\n\n127\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.304\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n128\n00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:31.665\nwhen we start to take a look at\nthe idea of troubleshooting,\n\n129\n00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:35.784\nwhat we want you to do is be able to\napply an approach to troubleshooting.\n\n130\n00:06:35.784 --> 00:06:40.555\nThat should help you to effectively\napproach just about every problem in\n\n131\n00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:44.775\nthe same steps or same manner,\nwhatever you want to call it, and\n\n132\n00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:47.720\nget a consistent result out of that.\n\n133\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.258\nNow sometimes, you actually have to kind\nof apply the one that fits the best, so\n\n134\n00:06:52.258 --> 00:06:55.736\nyou can't approach every single\nproblem exactly the same.\n\n135\n00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:59.711\nBut you can at least come up with\nsome different ways that we can limit\n\n136\n00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:03.705\nourselves to in different methodologies\nthat should help you out.\n\n137\n00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:06.183\nOkay, so\nlet's take a look at my screen here, and\n\n138\n00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:09.390\nI'll kind of show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n139\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.660\nNow, Daniel, as we look on the screen,\nokay, there's a lot of elements here.\n\n140\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.610\nAnd this is just gonna get more crowded,\nbut\n\n141\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.530\nI'll try and explain as we go along, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.310\nThere's a lot of different elements, and\n\n143\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.640\none of the things we actually have,\nlook at that.\n\n144\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.620\nThat OSI model over here, and I also went\nahead and put down the TCP/IP model,\n\n145\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.350\njust for a moment.\n\n146\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.510\nThe reality is this, right, the OSI model,\nremember grade four, referencing and\n\n147\n00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.160\ndiscussing, and helping you to be\nable to explain what happened.\n\n148\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.020\nBut in reality, when we apply\nwhatever we're going to apply in\n\n149\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.620\na troubleshooting approach, we're really\nputting it here in the TCP/IP model.\n\n150\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.386\nIf it's about networking as far\nas what you and I go, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:51.908\nNow, when we begin troubleshooting,\nmost of the time today, I recommend this.\n\n152\n00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:56.186\nWhich is that you start with\na solid basis of this model, okay,\n\n153\n00:07:56.186 --> 00:08:01.190\nif you can do that, the model will help\nyou to approach troubleshooting In\n\n154\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.940\na very standardized way that will allow\nyou to eventually solve the problem.\n\n155\n00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.589\nThe only thing that gets you faster\nat solving the problem is experience.\n\n156\n00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:15.103\nSo if you're not trying to solve\nthe problem, you're gonna get frustrated.\n\n157\n00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:18.970\nSo this actually give you an approach\nthat you can always take to do so.\n\n158\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.424\nSo when you see this dotted arrow that\nI've put here even though we can say that\n\n159\n00:08:24.424 --> 00:08:29.191\nthe trouble shooting methodology begins\nwith whatever methods are out here such as\n\n160\n00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:31.328\nbeginning with problem isolation.\n\n161\n00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:36.411\nI always like to say, it really begins\nwith your solid foundational knowledge\n\n162\n00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:41.210\nof the way that networking basically\nworks in an end to end process.\n\n163\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.618\nSo Daniel, if I can actually\nunderstand the OSI model and\n\n164\n00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:47.387\nthe communication process that we've done,\n\n165\n00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:51.576\nit helps me to be able to isolate that\nall the way down to what I need to and\n\n166\n00:08:51.576 --> 00:08:55.636\nto be able to figure that thing out and\nthe way that we need to as well.\n\n167\n00:08:55.636 --> 00:09:00.035\nSo once we get that and we have\na solid base of knowledge of a lot of\n\n168\n00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:03.570\ndifferent things,\nwhat works on each layer.\n\n169\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.635\nWe also have of course even if we've\nbeen memorizing and studying this.\n\n170\n00:09:07.635 --> 00:09:11.175\nWe have different devices that we know\nthat in which we are troubleshooting at\n\n171\n00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.800\ndifferent layers, as well.\n\n172\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.830\nWe know what protocols are there.\n\n173\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.005\nWe start to actually\nfigure this thing out and\n\n174\n00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:20.510\nwe start to actually understand where\nthings are beginning to go wrong.\n\n175\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.342\nSo from that point, you carry that all\nthe way through to the point where it is\n\n176\n00:09:25.342 --> 00:09:29.950\nnow going to be here it is,\nyou have an issue, you have a problem.\n\n177\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.900\nSo now, we begin with this.\n\n178\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.395\nNow, up at the top going\nhorizontally across the screen.\n\n179\n00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:40.628\nEvery troubleshooting model\ncan kind of be boiled down to\n\n180\n00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:43.840\nthese three very generalized steps.\n\n181\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.913\nNow, don't get me wrong there.\n\n182\n00:09:44.913 --> 00:09:47.570\nAre tons of troubleshooting\nmodels out there and available?\n\n183\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.327\nYes, and\n\n184\n00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:53.827\nat one point in the realm of Cisco\nused to have to memorize all of them.\n\n185\n00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:55.034\nBut today though,\n\n186\n00:09:55.034 --> 00:10:00.241\nwe're really kind of limiting ourselves to\nkind of the three and instead of naming\n\n187\n00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:05.455\nthem something weird like the official\nCisco troubleshooting seven step model.\n\n188\n00:10:05.455 --> 00:10:09.128\nThey said, look, let's break it down to\nwhat the really description is about and\n\n189\n00:10:09.128 --> 00:10:11.020\nhow you do troubleshooting.\n\n190\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.019\nSo when we begin with these approaches,\nokay, what we want to do is we wanna\n\n191\n00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:19.409\nunderstand and the great thing is the name\nis relatively intuitive to help us out.\n\n192\n00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:21.092\nSo we're gonna start here.\n\n193\n00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:24.070\nThat is pretty much the key\nat the very beginning.\n\n194\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.987\nOne of the problems that we have right\naway when we begin troubleshooting is\n\n195\n00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:29.548\noops, along with my computer going out.\n&gt;&gt; Computer going to sleep.\n\n196\n00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:33.021\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The problem isolation and\n\n197\n00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:34.837\nthat means that we need to what?\n\n198\n00:10:34.837 --> 00:10:38.229\nTo isolate that problem or eliminate\nwhat all the other possibilities are.\n\n199\n00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:43.115\nSo there's two different aspects of this\nis that, is this part of the issue or\n\n200\n00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:45.800\nis it not a part of the issue?\n\n201\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.301\nAnd that's kinda the key.\n\n202\n00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:51.170\nBecause I can end up, Daniel,\nif I'm just starting out.\n\n203\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.962\nI might go, I think this is the issue.\n\n204\n00:10:52.962 --> 00:10:56.175\nAnd that might solve what I think is\nthe problem there, but it might not have\n\n205\n00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:59.441\nanything to do with the problem that\nI'm actually experiencing right now.\n\n206\n00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:05.325\nSo that would be terrible to spend all\nthat time focused in on the wrong thing.\n\n207\n00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:09.670\nSo instead, we wanna make sure that\nwe isolate the actual problem that we\n\n208\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.340\nare experiencing right now.\n\n209\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.280\nSo key in on that is pretty\nmuch what we wanna do.\n\n210\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.139\nThere is of course bottom up.\n\n211\n00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:21.443\nNow when we start talking about that,\neverybody always go, okay, so\n\n212\n00:11:21.443 --> 00:11:24.260\nwhat does that actually\nmean in networking?\n\n213\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.400\nWell, in philosophy is kind of saying,\nall the details should lead you to what?\n\n214\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.642\nOne answer.\n\n215\n00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:33.170\nThat is what we're doing and then when\nyou start doing that, that's fine.\n\n216\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.492\nBut how do we move that\nidea into networking?\n\n217\n00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:37.930\nThat is what we wanna talk about.\n\n218\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.000\nWhat the way that we do that is\ninstead we use the OSI model.\n\n219\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.900\nRemember that in OSI model,\nthe upper layer depends on what?\n\n220\n00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.960\nThe layers that are beneath it.\n\n221\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.914\nSo when we can actually get to\nthe application everything's functioning\n\n222\n00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:54.380\nproperly on the other end,\n\n223\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.839\nit is because all these other\nlayers have actually functioned.\n\n224\n00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:01.978\nSo if I send you something,\nit means that you can read it and\n\n225\n00:12:01.978 --> 00:12:06.219\nyou can do what you need to with it and\nthat everything else.\n\n226\n00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:10.601\nFrom layer 1 all the way through layer 7\nand you're looking at in the application\n\n227\n00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:14.950\nlooking at, it means it functioned from\nlayer 1 all the way up through layer 7.\n\n228\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.188\nSo in that sense,\nwe can actually use that approach too.\n\n229\n00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:20.720\nSo that is also possible.\n\n230\n00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.249\nSo when we talk about bottom up,\nwhat we are trying to do is that we go.\n\n231\n00:12:25.249 --> 00:12:29.280\nSo what is the actual issue at this point?\n\n232\n00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.670\nIf I can do that, I can actually\nstart troubleshooting like this.\n\n233\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.960\nIs it just my computer is not\nactually connected to the network?\n\n234\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.830\nThat's something that\nI can always count on.\n\n235\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.693\nSo when I used to actually\nkind of support an Office,\n\n236\n00:12:44.693 --> 00:12:48.991\nthere was this one particular computer\nthat I had just forgotten months before\n\n237\n00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:53.117\nthat that they were telling me that\nthey had network connectivity issues.\n\n238\n00:12:53.117 --> 00:12:55.854\nI checked and I was like,\nit looks like ti's working fine now.\n\n239\n00:12:55.854 --> 00:12:57.004\nI forgot about it.\n\n240\n00:12:57.004 --> 00:13:01.020\nSo a month after that,\nthey were saying, it was fine.\n\n241\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.621\nBut now, it stopped working again.\n\n242\n00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:06.455\nSo I went back to the computer and\nI was like no, everything is still fine.\n\n243\n00:13:06.455 --> 00:13:07.787\nIt was still working.\n\n244\n00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:12.197\nFinally in the end, the person was calling\nme every day and I was like something else\n\n245\n00:13:12.197 --> 00:13:15.473\nis wrong and I should have just\nchecked at the physical layer.\n\n246\n00:13:15.473 --> 00:13:17.900\nDaniel, I went underneath that desk.\n\n247\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.287\nI took a look at the cable.\n\n248\n00:13:19.287 --> 00:13:21.900\nI was like the cable looks good on\nthe end plugging into the computer.\n\n249\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.409\nI could see link lights, so\nI knew that it was good.\n\n250\n00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:29.389\nBut then when I moved the computer back\ninto place, the link light disappeared.\n\n251\n00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:31.359\nI was like something\nelse is going on here.\n\n252\n00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:36.112\nI went to unplug that cable from\nthe wall and it just fell out, and\n\n253\n00:13:36.112 --> 00:13:40.353\nthen I looked at it, and\nthat locking tab had broken off.\n\n254\n00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:43.480\nAnd so what was happening is every once\nin a while, it would get loosened.\n\n255\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.036\nAnd the reason why it would get loosened\nis that the computer would get jarred,\n\n256\n00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:47.172\nbecause it was down by their feet.\n\n257\n00:13:47.172 --> 00:13:50.543\nThey would kick the computer or something\nand it'd just loosen up a little bit, but\n\n258\n00:13:50.543 --> 00:13:51.859\nit would still stay connected.\n\n259\n00:13:51.859 --> 00:13:54.703\nBy the time I would walk over there,\nit was like I'm connected.\n\n260\n00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:56.950\nAnd so I didn't even think about it.\n\n261\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:01.724\nBut if I would have started right there\ninstead of me just going, let me check.\n\n262\n00:14:01.724 --> 00:14:05.930\nLook, I can see the ITProTV web page,\nwhatever.\n\n263\n00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.512\nYou can do something like that.\n\n264\n00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:09.230\nI should've just checked right here.\n\n265\n00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.807\nThat would have solved me trying\nto troubleshoot that week\n\n266\n00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:12.554\nafter week.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n267\n00:14:12.554 --> 00:14:16.067\nwhat's interesting if we go back to what\nRonnie was talking about when it comes\n\n268\n00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:16.983\nto shotgun effect.\n\n269\n00:14:16.983 --> 00:14:19.477\nWhat if Ronnie had just went there and\nsaid, okay,\n\n270\n00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:22.148\nthis computer's having\ntrouble staying connected?\n\n271\n00:14:22.148 --> 00:14:23.725\nI'm just gonna swap out the network card.\n\n272\n00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:25.499\nHe swaps out the network card.\n\n273\n00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:27.530\nYeah, it's everything's working.\n\n274\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.310\nAll of a sudden, it stops working again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.395\n&gt;&gt; So what looked to be a solution,\n\n276\n00:14:32.395 --> 00:14:34.955\nbecause he's gonna unplug the cable.\n\n277\n00:14:34.955 --> 00:14:35.903\nHe's gonna plug it back in.\n\n278\n00:14:35.903 --> 00:14:40.244\nHe's gonna jiggle the tower, because\nit's gonna have a new NIC put in it.\n\n279\n00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:43.770\nAnd for a moment, he's probably gonna\nget connectivity before he walks away.\n\n280\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.510\nBut that cable would eventually work\nits way back out of that connector and\n\n281\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.137\nstill have the same problem, so\n\n282\n00:14:49.137 --> 00:14:51.293\nyou didn't actually solve the issue.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n283\n00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:54.642\nalways wanna start with that methodology.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n284\n00:14:54.642 --> 00:14:57.275\njust something like this\nif that's what you realize.\n\n285\n00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:01.128\nSo for me,\nespecially on things like workstations,\n\n286\n00:15:01.128 --> 00:15:03.710\nI always start with layer one.\n\n287\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.103\nNow I'm not saying that's always gonna be\ntrue of something that you start with, but\n\n288\n00:15:08.103 --> 00:15:12.130\nI know that when it's a computer work\nstation I always verify connectivity and\n\n289\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.568\nthe worst issue is us not paying\nattention to certain things here.\n\n290\n00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:19.430\nSo let's deal with layer two just for\na moment as an example.\n\n291\n00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.420\nSo when we start talking about this,\nDaniel,\n\n292\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.200\nthis actually happened in our\nOffice right here a few weeks ago.\n\n293\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.972\nSo Daniel, if you were to check\nout your network adapter for\n\n294\n00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:34.575\nthe wireless adapters right now,\nthere's like ten different wireless\n\n295\n00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:36.978\nnetworks right now in our building.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n296\n00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.093\n&gt;&gt; I mean, do you look at it?\n\n297\n00:15:38.093 --> 00:15:40.049\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; We're chalk full of them.\n\n298\n00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:41.261\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then there's so\n\n299\n00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:44.952\nmany other office buildings around where\nITProTV studios are located sometimes if\n\n300\n00:15:44.952 --> 00:15:46.941\nthe wind's right, you can get like-\n&gt;&gt; You could get the, yeah,\n\n301\n00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:47.937\nall sorts of stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n\n302\n00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:51.330\nI mean, you get so\nmany different ones that end up happening.\n\n303\n00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.980\nSo one of the things that started\nhappening and I didn't check it.\n\n304\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:01.237\nA little bit hard to check physically on\nthe idea that the wireless NIC is working\n\n305\n00:16:01.237 --> 00:16:06.040\nor not working So I actually said,\nall right, well, let me check here.\n\n306\n00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.352\nSo I did,\nI took a look at the drop down for\n\n307\n00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:13.950\nwhere the networks were, and\nI saw that it was working.\n\n308\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.570\nSo I knew that the wireless\nNIC in that computer,\n\n309\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.990\nit could see the different networks,\nand it did, it was there.\n\n310\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.180\nBut now, when I started to take a look\nat it, they said, hey, I can't print.\n\n311\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.280\nWell, the next layer for\nme to go to is the data link layer.\n\n312\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.570\nI don't just jump right up and\nI start troubleshooting the application.\n\n313\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.530\nInstead, what I did is when I\ntook a look at that drop down,\n\n314\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.080\nI saw something right away, Daniel.\n\n315\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.600\nWhich is that for us, we have\nan ITProTV network for internal things.\n\n316\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.490\nBut we also have an ITProTV guest for\npeople that come by and visit our studios.\n\n317\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.330\nOr they're somebody that's trying\nto meet with somebody inside, and\n\n318\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.250\nwe don't give them access\nto our internal network,\n\n319\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.620\nwe give them access to the guest network,\nokay?\n\n320\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.150\nThis person's laptop had simply, and\nthe reason why they couldn't print,\n\n321\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.340\nis that their laptop had connected\nto what, the guest network instead.\n\n322\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.200\nThat is really just a layer two issue at\nthis point, okay, so it was easy enough.\n\n323\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.380\nSometimes you have to go\nbeyond the physical layer and\n\n324\n00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.120\nthen you can get up to the next.\n\n325\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.327\nSo that's where you can take that\ntroubleshooting methodology and\n\n326\n00:17:19.327 --> 00:17:24.139\nyou begin to work up that way too, okay,\nso that makes sense when you do that.\n\n327\n00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:26.339\nNow, let's talk about the next one, or\n\n328\n00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.602\nI'll continue to just kind of drone on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n329\n00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:29.975\n&gt;&gt; And we can move all the way\n\n330\n00:17:29.975 --> 00:17:31.290\nup through here.\n\n331\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.312\nBut for us, you kind of get the idea\nof why you would start at the bottom.\n\n332\n00:17:34.312 --> 00:17:39.210\nI always take, like I said, at the end\nuser workstation, I always verify that.\n\n333\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.160\nNow, does that mean you can't do that for\neverything, no, you absolutely can.\n\n334\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.800\nBut remember,\nif you're actually in a quick hurry,\n\n335\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.110\nyou may actually choose something else.\n\n336\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.260\nLet's talk about this idea of top-down.\n\n337\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.730\nNow, top-down, I've got these\ncolors backward here, no wonder.\n\n338\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.583\nI'm like,\npeople are probably confused here,\n\n339\n00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:58.350\nI didn't realize that I had changed that,\nthat is my fault completely.\n\n340\n00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.670\nThey're like, hey Ronnie, your\ntop-down should be orange, not yellow.\n\n341\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.470\nAnd that actually confused me for\na moment,\n\n342\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.170\nlet me change that,\nmake that actually right there.\n\n343\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.980\nSo here it is,\nwhen we start talking with top-down,\n\n344\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.870\nnotice that this one goes from\nthe application layer and works down.\n\n345\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.880\nNow, when might you actually\ndo something like this?\n\n346\n00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.700\nWell, everybody has been able to\n\n347\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.820\ncontinue to connect to the places\nthat they wanted to, right?\n\n348\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.880\nLet's say that everybody says no,\n\n349\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.800\nI can browse to the Internet,\nI can do this, I can do that.\n\n350\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.490\nI can get access to network shares,\nbut I try and\n\n351\n00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.250\ngo to this website, and it doesn't work.\n\n352\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.030\nWell, if I think about that,\nthat means what?\n\n353\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.655\nPhysical layer's good, NIC's good,\n\n354\n00:18:37.655 --> 00:18:43.080\nthey're already hitting other websites,\nwhich means IP addresses are fine.\n\n355\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.400\nThey're getting information that comes\nback and goes forward, sessions are good.\n\n356\n00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.880\nThey're actually able to read the web\npage, the application seems to be working,\n\n357\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.480\nall except for one website.\n\n358\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.448\nSo this is when you actually go,\nall right, so\n\n359\n00:18:58.448 --> 00:19:00.290\nlet's take a look at that browser.\n\n360\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.370\nAnd then I'm gonna take a look at\nthe information that it's giving me.\n\n361\n00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.180\nAnd I may even go to another machine and\ngo, are you able to connect?\n\n362\n00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.280\nAnd all of a sudden, that one is\nactually not able to connect either.\n\n363\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.590\nWell, now I'm no longer dealing\nwith these upper three layers.\n\n364\n00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.350\nNow I have two or three machines saying,\nhey, I can't connect to there either.\n\n365\n00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.690\nThat means I can begin here\nat the transport layer.\n\n366\n00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.740\nBut when I take a look at the browser,\nand it opens up and\n\n367\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.440\nit doesn't show me anything,\nI'm not receiving traffic.\n\n368\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.140\nI'm not getting any chunks\nof data coming through.\n\n369\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.840\nSo that probably means that I need\nto begin troubleshooting here.\n\n370\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.140\nSo you can use that to help you to isolate\nand then come down to the network layer.\n\n371\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.320\nIf the network layer is it, you go and\nstart troubleshooting the equipment that\n\n372\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.930\nyou need to, to see where along this\npath are we not getting connected.\n\n373\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.406\nIt could be at the server room,\nserver might not just be responding.\n\n374\n00:19:47.406 --> 00:19:48.663\n&gt;&gt; And that's a really interesting point.\n\n375\n00:19:48.663 --> 00:19:52.224\nBecause a lot of times, just going into\nthe practicality of troubleshooting, which\n\n376\n00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.000\nRonnie and I have both have had to do-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.031\n&gt;&gt; On multiple, multiple occasions,\n\n378\n00:19:56.031 --> 00:20:00.810\nis sometimes it's not anything that\nis wrong with any of your equipment.\n\n379\n00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.120\nWhich I can connect to Google,\nI can connect to Microsoft.\n\n380\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.080\nBut when I try to get Amazon,\nthings aren't working.\n\n381\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.930\nDoesn't necessarily mean\nsomething's wrong on my end.\n\n382\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.100\nIt might actually be that\nAmazon's site is down,\n\n383\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.150\nor at least the one that\nI'm trying to connect to.\n\n384\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:18.360\nSo that is always a possibility,\neverything is technically working,\n\n385\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.320\nexcept on the other end, right?\n&gt;&gt; So there are issues\n\n386\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.924\nthat you have to face like this, but\nnotice how we approached it, right?\n\n387\n00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:29.410\nWe took one or the other,\nwhether it's from the bottom-up or not.\n\n388\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.740\nAnd this all actually comes down\nto experience a lot of times,\n\n389\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.240\nif you choose to do this.\n\n390\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.640\nWe'll also talk about these two\na little bit more in-depth in a moment.\n\n391\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.430\nBut let me go through the idea\nof divide and conquer, and\n\n392\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.560\nthat one will help us out too, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.050\nNow, when you talk about dividing and\nconquer, this is where you go, all right,\n\n394\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.400\nso I already know some of the stuff.\n\n395\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.500\nSo you assume like I did here, okay,\nyou go, hey, look, physical and\n\n396\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.610\ndata link there, that's working.\n\n397\n00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.980\nSo you might just go ahead and\njump onto the network, okay?\n\n398\n00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.287\nSo when I go to an end user workstation,\nI told you,\n\n399\n00:21:01.287 --> 00:21:03.045\nI always start at the physical layer.\n\n400\n00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:05.830\nCuz I don't know if they're\nactually connected to the wall,\n\n401\n00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.400\nor if the wireless is actually working.\n\n402\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.840\nThen if that's working,\nI know the data link is working.\n\n403\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.940\nAre they able to connect to whatever\nresource they want to using IP address or\n\n404\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.640\nDNS to make that work?\n\n405\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.320\nThen that's perfectly fine,\n\n406\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.560\nthen I know that I can begin\ntroubleshooting at that point as well.\n\n407\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.310\nNow once you do the divide and\n\n408\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.030\nconquer, okay, here is the question\nthat you want to have.\n\n409\n00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.859\nAnd that's actually represented by this\ntwo-headed green arrow right here, okay,\n\n410\n00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.070\nnow, what does this mean?\n\n411\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.540\nLet's say that I get to the network layer,\nand\n\n412\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.380\nwhen I do that and\nnow I can, I can't connect.\n\n413\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.090\nWell, what does that actually mean?\n\n414\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:50.230\nWell, if it's actually an IP issue,\nthen I know something that,\n\n415\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.070\nhey I've got to actually stay\nright here and troubleshoot.\n\n416\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.819\nBut what if everything\nactually does seem fine,\n\n417\n00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:59.719\nin other words the IP address is\nresponding, let's say, to pings.\n\n418\n00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:02.829\nIf we're actually able\nto ping the other side,\n\n419\n00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:06.080\nthen I know that network is not the issue.\n\n420\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.801\nAnd that means I have to actually be\nable to move up in that protocol stack.\n\n421\n00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:12.688\nWhich means for us at the transport layer,\n\n422\n00:22:12.688 --> 00:22:16.232\nthen we would begin troubleshooting\nat the transport layer as well.\n\n423\n00:22:16.232 --> 00:22:20.110\nBut let's say that at the network layer,\noops,\n\n424\n00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.510\nI'm starting to change that,\nwhich I didn't want to do.\n\n425\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.310\nSee if I can grab this thing again,\nthere we go.\n\n426\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.290\nIf I move down to the data link layer\nhere, now, why would I do this?\n\n427\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.710\nWhat if I'm actually not getting\nany response at all, okay?\n\n428\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.170\nWell, then I might check out\nthe data link later then, so\n\n429\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.770\nhow do you do this, all right?\n\n430\n00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.460\nSo here is the way that it works for\neach one of these.\n\n431\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.745\nBut the divide and conquer is kind of\nthe easiest one to use an example of.\n\n432\n00:22:44.745 --> 00:22:49.037\nOkay, regardless of where you start,\nwhether it's top or down, okay, the bottom\n\n433\n00:22:49.037 --> 00:22:52.920\nis the only one that this doesn't apply\nto, that's why [INAUDIBLE], okay?\n\n434\n00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.255\nSo let's do this,\nwith the divide and conquer, Daniel,\n\n435\n00:22:57.255 --> 00:22:59.275\nhere's the way that we answer this.\n\n436\n00:22:59.275 --> 00:23:03.124\nIf I go to the data link layer and\nI see, not only the link light,\n\n437\n00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:07.499\nI see the activity light, so\nI know I'm sending and receiving, okay.\n\n438\n00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:12.891\nI've gotten an answer which says, NIC\nis good, okay, so that means I move up.\n\n439\n00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:17.287\nIf I can grab that ever again.\n\n440\n00:23:17.287 --> 00:23:22.390\nOkay, I move up the actual stack here,\nbut what if I don't get anything?\n\n441\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.130\nI look, and\n\n442\n00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.500\nall of a sudden I realize something,\nthat the activity light is not blinking.\n\n443\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.940\nOr that there's no light at all,\nthat means I move down the stack instead.\n\n444\n00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.405\nSo this is how you do that, right,\nif you get an answer at one layer,\n\n445\n00:23:37.405 --> 00:23:42.350\nping's working,\nit means I move up to the transport layer.\n\n446\n00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:48.860\nCan I actually see the port numbers coming\nuncrossed, the way that it needs to.\n\n447\n00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.430\nAnd then I can begin to move up\nto the application at that point\n\n448\n00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.570\nif that starts to happen, okay?\n\n449\n00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.730\nBut if I don't get an answer at\nwhatever layer I choose to start with,\n\n450\n00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.040\nthen that's what happens from there, okay?\n\n451\n00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.260\nSo when we start to see this,\n\n452\n00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.950\nstart to see something like this, that\nis what we're also doing as well, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:12.920\nSo that is kind of a key to us beginning\nto isolate where the problem is gonna be.\n\n454\n00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.618\nSo take a look at these different\napproaches that are out there.\n\n455\n00:24:16.618 --> 00:24:17.323\nAnd in our lab,\n\n456\n00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:21.040\nthey actually have a nice little guide\nthat kind of describes it as well.\n\n457\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.850\nYou're, again, getting my approach in\nthe way that they're talking about here.\n\n458\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.370\nBut this is the beginning\nof problem isolation.\n\n459\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.940\nDaniel, we still need to talk\nabout implementing corrections and\n\n460\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.060\nthen verifying outcomes, and\nthen we'll get into our lab here.\n\n461\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.708\nBut overall, though,\nthat's probably enough for this episode,\n\n462\n00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:39.275\ncuz I realize we're running out\nof time again cuz I keep talking.\n\n463\n00:24:39.275 --> 00:24:40.059\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:42.078\n&gt;&gt; But we'll actually do another one here\n\n465\n00:24:42.078 --> 00:24:46.340\nand finish up our at least basic models\nhere, and then we'll move into our lab.\n\n466\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.559\n&gt;&gt; All right, excellent, Ronnie,\n\n467\n00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:49.458\nsounds like a plan,\nwe all have our marching orders.\n\n468\n00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:52.217\nGo out there and start troubleshooting\neverything you can find cuz it's so\n\n469\n00:24:52.217 --> 00:24:52.800\nmuch fun to do.\n\n470\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.220\nAnd then we'll figure out what we\ncan do with those results later.\n\n471\n00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.920\nRonnie, thanks for joining us,\nlooking forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n472\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.410\nHopefully you good folks will join us,\nas well.\n\n473\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.880\nAs for this, we're gonna call it a day,\nthanks for watching, everyone.\n\n474\n00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.780\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n475\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.609\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n476\n00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:07.523\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n477\n00:25:07.523 --> 00:25:14.740\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.872\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:12.186\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:12.722\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:16.595\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:19.979\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:22.460\nwe are gonna spin gold out of,\nwell, straw.\n\n8\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.965\nRonnie's gonna do it for\nus today, it's gonna be awesome.\n\n9\n00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:25.665\nNo, no, no, no,\nI'm just having a little fun.\n\n10\n00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:27.455\nWe're back for more CCENT.\n\n11\n00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:30.050\nAnd as I let the cat out of the bag,\nRonnie is back with us.\n\n12\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.599\nRonnie, we're glad to have you yet\nagain today.\n\n13\n00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.393\nHow is it going, man?\n\n14\n00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:35.726\n&gt;&gt; It's going very well except that\nyou referred to be as Rumpelstiltskin,\n\n15\n00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:36.972\nand now, I'm wondering.\n\n16\n00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:38.065\n&gt;&gt; He's cool, man.\n\n17\n00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:41.938\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Daniel, thank you\nfor having me on this show as we continue\n\n18\n00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:46.470\non learning more, of course, about our\nCCENT, and getting ready for that exam.\n\n19\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.944\nWe're in the middle of taking a look at,\nof course,\n\n20\n00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:51.546\napplying troubleshooting models or\nmethodologies.\n\n21\n00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:53.680\nAnd we are now ready to proceed on.\n\n22\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.210\nSo let's go ahead and pick up here, and\nwe'll also show you the concept and\n\n23\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.610\nlab that we have ready for\nyou as well, okay?\n\n24\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.190\nSo we've just talked about the different\nproblem isolation stuff, right?\n\n25\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.030\nAnd we went through those to try and\n\n26\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.660\nhelp you out to start off with\na consistent methodology, right?\n\n27\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.660\nA step by step approach that as you\nend up seeing a networking issue or\n\n28\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.310\nproblem, you shouldn't just try and\ndo a shotgun approach.\n\n29\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.030\nThis should help you to isolate what\nyou actually want to be able to do.\n\n30\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.791\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nyou gave us three great approaches.\n\n31\n00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:28.510\nYou gave us, what was it, the top, down,\nbottom, up, and the divide and conquer.\n\n32\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.010\n&gt;&gt; Divide and conquer.\n\n33\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.600\n&gt;&gt; All fantastic, all have their place.\n\n34\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.187\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n35\n00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:34.717\nthen we kind of left off from there,\nonce we employ a methodology,\n\n36\n00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:37.316\nwe have to kinda continue on from there,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:39.105\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that-\n&gt;&gt; It's at the end of the show.\n\n38\n00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthis is not the end of the show yet.\n\n39\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.310\nSo yeah, don't get me wrong.\n\n40\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.440\nMemorizing those are going to\nhelp you on the exam as well.\n\n41\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.360\nBut understanding that this is part of\nthat general troubleshooting nature and\n\n42\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.180\napproach that pretty much\nevery method comes along.\n\n43\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.360\nIsolating a problem is key when it begins.\n\n44\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.559\nNow, once you do figure out\nwhat problem that you're at,\n\n45\n00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:02.822\nmore than likely you're gonna end up\nisolating down to usually two or three.\n\n46\n00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.304\nAt that point, you kind of pick\nwhich one you believe is gonna be\n\n47\n00:02:06.304 --> 00:02:09.139\nthe one that's gonna lead\nyou to the right answer.\n\n48\n00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.135\nThe reason why you don't always wanna\nisolate down to one immediately.\n\n49\n00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:15.985\nI know this sounds strange unless\nyou really can do this great, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:21.178\nIs that more than likely, if you just do\nthat, you give yourself tunnel vision and\n\n51\n00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:26.260\nyou absolutely expect that that's gonna\nbe the only issue that could be wrong.\n\n52\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.396\nSometimes you might find yourself\nwhere it's actually a couple of\n\n53\n00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:30.353\ndifferent issues.\n\n54\n00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:34.874\nSo that's why you want to at least kind of\nnarrow it down to do what you want to be\n\n55\n00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:36.050\nable to do.\n\n56\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990\nSo that's what we have here, okay?\n\n57\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.199\nNow, once the problem isolation is there,\nthe next step is simple, right?\n\n58\n00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.026\nAnd everything else is try something.\n\n59\n00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:48.320\nAnd that is some type of corrective\naction, is what you want to try next.\n\n60\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.050\nNow, there are a couple of different\napproaches to doing this, okay?\n\n61\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.640\nThe OSI model approach\nreally helps us once again,\n\n62\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.260\ndepending on what we need to do, okay?\n\n63\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.480\nIt can help us, and we're looking at the\nbottom half of the screen right now, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.060\nAt the Physical layer, I already told you\nsome of the things that we ended up doing.\n\n65\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.520\nWe of course, can just try and\ntake a look at cabling if we need to.\n\n66\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.310\nWe can verify at the lights here, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.719\nAre they actually working,\nare connectors good, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.392\nSo if they're bad on the connectors,\nright,\n\n69\n00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:24.440\nwe need to either get a new cable or\nwe need to do what?\n\n70\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.586\nWe need to re-crimp the new end on it,\nand that helps us out too, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.860\nThe same thing if\nthe lights are not working.\n\n72\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.147\nThere is no way that you're verifying\nthat the light is actually working.\n\n73\n00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:38.305\nSo you may want to either replace that so\nthat you can easily verify that, or\n\n74\n00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:42.400\njust make sure that everything\nis actually the way it needs to.\n\n75\n00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.160\nNow, at the Data Link layer you're gonna\nbe checking NICs, of course, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.880\nYou want to make sure that this is\nalso sending and receiving traffic.\n\n77\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.990\nSwitches are generally where\nyou'll be working at as well.\n\n78\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.410\nAnd then of course, for us, where our main\nissue in troubleshooting is gonna be,\n\n79\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.060\nis this actually going to the right NIC,\nthe right MAC address?\n\n80\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.338\nOr is it actually from the right\nMAC address as well, so\n\n81\n00:04:04.338 --> 00:04:06.918\nyou'll also be checking out there, too.\n\n82\n00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:09.820\nAnd then at the Network layer,\nyou're normally dealing with routers.\n\n83\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.910\nIs it gonna be IP addressing and\nthen filtering, right?\n\n84\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.839\nStraight up what we call access lists\na lot of times where it might be\n\n85\n00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.447\nblocking just certain IP addresses or not.\n\n86\n00:04:19.447 --> 00:04:20.972\nAnd then you can get to, well,\n\n87\n00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:23.810\neven more advanced filtering\nonce you start doing that.\n\n88\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.460\nWhere you say, hey, not only to this\naddress, but even to this protocol.\n\n89\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.140\nSo you might continue to move up and\nwork from there.\n\n90\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.530\nNow, I didn't fill out the rest of this\nbecause we're dealing with network\n\n91\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.790\ntroubleshooting.\n\n92\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.180\nSo we're not really concerned about\nwhether or not, I shouldn't say that.\n\n93\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.028\nWe're not really, in the end here,\n\n94\n00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:42.954\nright, when we talk about\ntroubleshooting networking.\n\n95\n00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:44.710\nThe data is what it is, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.500\nIf it's corrupted,\nthat's not our issue at this point,\n\n97\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.750\nunless we realize that one of\nthese devices is causing that.\n\n98\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.649\nBut for us, right, it's really about,\nare these things working so\n\n99\n00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.888\nthat I can deliver it from\nthe source to the destination?\n\n100\n00:04:57.888 --> 00:04:59.830\nAnd that's what I'm\nreally concerned about.\n\n101\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.310\nSo at this point,\nit's whatever application from there,\n\n102\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.970\nyou can troubleshoot the application.\n\n103\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.880\nOr you turn it over to someone who can\ntroubleshoot the application if you go,\n\n104\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.290\nhey, these networking layers,\nevery device along that path,\n\n105\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.120\nevery configuration along\nthat path is working, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.040\nAnd then you don't worry\nabout it at that point.\n\n107\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.920\nYou escalate that if you need to.\n\n108\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.500\nBut the other thing which has\nalways served me well, Daniel,\n\n109\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.490\nespecially in Ciscoland, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.970\nIs this idea of once I get the basic\nskills that I need to in configuring\n\n111\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.840\nrouters and switches,\nI always want to start with what I know\n\n112\n00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.920\nshould be on that switch, or\nshould be on that router.\n\n113\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.200\nAll the other extraneous\nconfiguration that might be there,\n\n114\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.950\nit could be part of the problem.\n\n115\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.222\nBut I want to start by verifying,\n\n116\n00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:49.884\ndid I configure those\ninterfaces correctly, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:49.884 --> 00:05:52.730\nSo I always wanna start\nwith that as the base.\n\n118\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.120\nDo not go, well, that's possibly right.\n\n119\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.302\nYou've got to know,\nyou have to know, excuse me,\n\n120\n00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:02.900\nwhether or not it is right when you start.\n\n121\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.221\nSo when there is troubleshooting, a lot of\ntimes what I might end up doing, right,\n\n122\n00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.121\nis that I might go ahead and\njust for the sake of testing,\n\n123\n00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:13.200\nback up everything on that router,\nthat switch.\n\n124\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.168\nAnd I might just go ahead and startle it.\n\n125\n00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.336\nLet me make sure I can do\nbasic connectivity and\n\n126\n00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:21.154\nreconfigure those interfaces just\nto verify I can get connectivity.\n\n127\n00:06:21.154 --> 00:06:24.930\nAnd then I can add that back in\non those different configurations\n\n128\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.250\nto see what breaks it at that point.\n\n129\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.730\nBut I always want to begin\nwith what I know is right, and\n\n130\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.540\nthen I can begin to spot what\nisn't right as well, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.940\nSo implementing those types of\ncorrections that we need are key.\n\n132\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.200\nThis is the part that\ncomes with experience,\n\n133\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.800\nmore than any type of methodology\nthat we can show you.\n\n134\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.070\nBut the only methodology that I can\nactually kind of share with you through\n\n135\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.700\nexperience is begin with what\nyou know has to be there for\n\n136\n00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.670\nthose devices to communicate.\n\n137\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.475\nAnd then from that point,\neverything else that's extra.\n\n138\n00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:01.816\nWell, then you can start isolating them,\nturning them off,\n\n139\n00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:04.780\nor just making sure that\nthat's not part of the issue.\n\n140\n00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.000\nSo you can isolate that down and\nsay, here's my correction here,\n\n141\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.360\nis I'm gonna remove this item on this\ninterface, and see if that fixes anything.\n\n142\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.502\nIf it doesn't, put it back,\nis kind of the key.\n\n143\n00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:17.696\nCuz, okay, so\nthat didn't actually fix anything.\n\n144\n00:07:17.696 --> 00:07:19.196\nSo let me put it back in place.\n\n145\n00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:22.110\nSo I'm troubleshooting the original\nproblem as well, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.536\nSo that's a hard part to actually learn.\n\n147\n00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:27.362\nBecause it's easy, one of the things\nwe don't want to do, Daniel,\n\n148\n00:07:27.362 --> 00:07:29.920\nis something that you had\nmentioned before, right?\n\n149\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.960\nIs that in the part one that\nwe were talking about here,\n\n150\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.340\nright, is that we might try 15 different\nthings, 10 or 15 different things.\n\n151\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.240\nAnd now, when it's working and somebody\nsays, which one is the right answer?\n\n152\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.020\nYou're going, it's one of those ten.\n\n153\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.738\nWell, that's kind of\na hard situation to be in.\n\n154\n00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:52.128\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, you could redo all of\nthe ten steps that you did and then-\n\n155\n00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:53.030\n&gt;&gt; Every time.\n\n156\n00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.257\n&gt;&gt; Every time, that seems like a lot\nof wasted time and effort, though.\n\n157\n00:07:56.257 --> 00:07:58.070\nSo narrowing it down\nto the actual problem,\n\n158\n00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.402\nplus it kinda Proves to your employer and\nthe other people working around you that\n\n159\n00:08:01.402 --> 00:08:04.261\nyou can actually figure out what\nthe hell you're doing and not just.\n\n160\n00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:05.688\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH].\n\n161\n00:08:05.688 --> 00:08:07.779\n&gt;&gt; Anybody can shock and\n[INAUDIBLE] things, right?\n\n162\n00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.522\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's no what we want.\n\n163\n00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:13.343\nIn a true production environment\nspeed is kinda the key.\n\n164\n00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:16.069\nGetting things that\nare critical to work back and\n\n165\n00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:18.073\nthe nature that need to is also key.\n\n166\n00:08:18.073 --> 00:08:20.383\nThat's why we often emphasize backups.\n\n167\n00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:23.379\nAnd that's another thing that I should\nhave emphasized right from the beginning,\n\n168\n00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:24.335\nDaniel, that I didn't.\n\n169\n00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:27.000\nBefore you implement any correction,\nDaniel,\n\n170\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.706\nhow important do you think a backup\nof your configuration would be?\n\n171\n00:08:30.706 --> 00:08:33.343\n&gt;&gt; As important as anything, if not more.\n\n172\n00:08:33.343 --> 00:08:36.454\n&gt;&gt; Right, because if I\nimplement a correction, Daniel.\n\n173\n00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:38.623\nLet's say I do the thing\nthat you're talking about.\n\n174\n00:08:38.623 --> 00:08:39.238\n12 corrections.\n\n175\n00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:39.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n176\n00:08:39.838 --> 00:08:44.254\n&gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, not only doesn't\nit work, it actually has broken it more.\n\n177\n00:08:44.254 --> 00:08:45.096\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\n\n178\n00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:46.278\nthat's always the fear, right?\n\n179\n00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:49.691\nLike, yeah, you may have even actually\nfixed the issue that you had.\n\n180\n00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:50.931\nBut you created three more issues.\n\n181\n00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.365\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So the person's gonna go,\n\n182\n00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.804\nnow my computer's doing this, or now we're\nhaving trouble with connectivity to that.\n\n183\n00:08:55.804 --> 00:08:56.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:08:56.476 --> 00:08:57.219\n&gt;&gt; What did you do?\n\n185\n00:08:57.219 --> 00:08:59.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n186\n00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:00.012\nHey, is that Elvis?\n\n187\n00:09:00.012 --> 00:09:01.124\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:01.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once again,\n\n189\n00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.637\nlet's find if Elvis is in the building.\n\n190\n00:09:03.637 --> 00:09:05.963\nSo here, we have this idea, right?\n\n191\n00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:08.852\nSo before implementing any\nof these corrective steps,\n\n192\n00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:12.482\nget a good backup of your configurations\nand whatever you're doing.\n\n193\n00:09:12.482 --> 00:09:14.867\nAnd this is true, whether you're\non an end user work station or\n\n194\n00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:16.853\nwhether you're dealing with router and\nswitches.\n\n195\n00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:18.867\nRouter and\nswitch is a lot easier to back up.\n\n196\n00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:21.464\nBut then use a workstation\neven if it takes longer.\n\n197\n00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:26.211\nYou want to ask any files that you're\nworking on, go ahead and save those.\n\n198\n00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:31.198\nDo you already have this backed up in\na business to your centralized chair,\n\n199\n00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:34.770\nyour location of the files\nthat you absolutely need?\n\n200\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.016\nIf not, by me fixing a particular problem,\n\n201\n00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:42.688\nlike what Daniel said,\nI could end up really breaking it hard.\n\n202\n00:09:42.688 --> 00:09:46.723\nSo Daniel, you're more familiar with\nthe Linux operating system that I am.\n\n203\n00:09:46.723 --> 00:09:49.127\nThere's actually a command that can\nwipe the hard drive very easily.\n\n204\n00:09:49.127 --> 00:09:50.464\nJust a few different letters, right?\n\n205\n00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:52.134\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And you go, yes,\n\n206\n00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:54.795\nRonnie said I should do that and\npress Enter.\n\n207\n00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:55.496\nGo ahead.\n\n208\n00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:56.411\nWhat rm something?\n\n209\n00:09:56.411 --> 00:09:57.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, rm-rf.\n\n210\n00:09:57.835 --> 00:09:59.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, rm-rf slash.\n\n211\n00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:01.123\nAnd once you do, bye bye.\n\n212\n00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:03.455\n&gt;&gt; I mean that's just five letters.\n\n213\n00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:07.967\nAnd so I wouldn't ever want to do that,\nbut if I happen to go,\n\n214\n00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:13.114\nI'm reading this forum post or\na blog out there, and I'm gonna try.\n\n215\n00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:19.439\nBackup though, if I have a backup I go,\ngood thing there's a backup of this,\n\n216\n00:10:19.439 --> 00:10:20.572\nand we're ready to go.\n\n217\n00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:23.643\n&gt;&gt; I always say, backups are one of those\nthings that you would rather have and\n\n218\n00:10:23.643 --> 00:10:24.973\nnot need than need and not have.\n\n219\n00:10:24.973 --> 00:10:28.017\n&gt;&gt; That's a great idiom\nto actually think about.\n\n220\n00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:31.935\nSo make sure you do that before you\nimplement any of these correction steps.\n\n221\n00:10:31.935 --> 00:10:36.912\nI know that, especially with speed, you\ndon't tend to write a lot of things down.\n\n222\n00:10:36.912 --> 00:10:40.455\nBut make sure that even\nimmediately after doing it,\n\n223\n00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:45.202\njot down as much as you can, or\nas little as you can, that reminds you,\n\n224\n00:10:45.202 --> 00:10:48.196\nI did try this,\nI did do that, I did do that.\n\n225\n00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:51.046\nIt's a lot easier to go back\nright then if it's only three or\n\n226\n00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:52.648\nfour commands that you typed in.\n\n227\n00:10:52.648 --> 00:10:54.352\nTo kind of put those back in,\n\n228\n00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:58.115\nrather than go,\nI gotta restore the backup a lot of times.\n\n229\n00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.431\nNow on routers and switches,\n\n230\n00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:01.912\nthe backup config really\ndoesn't take too long to run.\n\n231\n00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:05.591\nBut a lot of times it also takes you\nto reboot it for it to happen too.\n\n232\n00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:07.454\nThat could cause some outage as well.\n\n233\n00:11:07.454 --> 00:11:10.412\nBut implementing corrections,\nyou have to try this.\n\n234\n00:11:10.412 --> 00:11:14.722\nAnd it's only gonna become better with\nexperience is what you'll actually\n\n235\n00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:15.338\nfind out.\n\n236\n00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:19.698\nYou won't actually do this, you won't get\nany better at if if you don't try it.\n\n237\n00:11:19.698 --> 00:11:23.171\nIf you don't try and actually fix stuff,\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n238\n00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:27.202\nSo in a lab setting,\nyou should try and break it.\n\n239\n00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:28.609\nI'm not saying go in there and\n\n240\n00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:31.857\ntake a screwdriver to your Cisco\nequipment that you just bought.\n\n241\n00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.934\n&gt;&gt; It's broke.\n&gt;&gt; It's broke, yeah, and\n\n242\n00:11:33.934 --> 00:11:35.513\nuse a hammer to do that.\n\n243\n00:11:35.513 --> 00:11:38.458\nBut what I'm saying it go in,\ntake the configuration,\n\n244\n00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:41.788\ntype in something that you know\nis obviously not going to work.\n\n245\n00:11:41.788 --> 00:11:45.485\nAnd then walk through this troubleshooting\nand that way it will help you out and\n\n246\n00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:47.342\nyou get something like that to happen.\n\n247\n00:11:47.342 --> 00:11:52.749\nOkay, all right, let's move on to\nthe idea of verifying the outcome.\n\n248\n00:11:52.749 --> 00:11:56.898\nNow Daniel, you'll notice right at\nthe top here, look at what I say.\n\n249\n00:11:56.898 --> 00:11:58.382\nStart with what you know is right.\n\n250\n00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:00.431\nThat is also part of this step too.\n\n251\n00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:01.409\n&gt;&gt; Could be a mantra.\n\n252\n00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:02.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it should be.\n\n253\n00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:06.645\nBecause this is how you verify, hey,\nhere's what I know to be right.\n\n254\n00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:10.144\nCuz if I can actually say\neverything else is right here,\n\n255\n00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:12.755\nthen I know I can isolate down once again.\n\n256\n00:12:12.755 --> 00:12:16.576\nBut as I move stuff around that\nI didn't want to move around.\n\n257\n00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:20.264\nSo always start, verify the outcome.\n\n258\n00:12:20.264 --> 00:12:22.579\nHere's what I'm expecting to see.\n\n259\n00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:25.316\nIf I don't see that then\nI know it's not right.\n\n260\n00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:25.939\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n261\n00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:27.677\n&gt;&gt; That's what's happened.\n\n262\n00:12:27.677 --> 00:12:29.767\nSo this is where you go and\nyou talk to somebody.\n\n263\n00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:33.034\nYou go,\nis this what you were expecting to see?\n\n264\n00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:35.167\nThey go, well sort of.\n\n265\n00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.684\nYou need to clarify that and\ngo, all right,\n\n266\n00:12:37.684 --> 00:12:41.848\ntell me what you were expecting to see\nhere or what should have happened.\n\n267\n00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:43.224\nWhat should be happening.\n\n268\n00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:45.181\nSometimes it's easy to actually know.\n\n269\n00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.679\nA web page doesn't come up\nthat they're expecting.\n\n270\n00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:48.658\nThe web page shows up.\n\n271\n00:12:48.658 --> 00:12:51.097\nOr at least the connection\nto the web page shows up.\n\n272\n00:12:51.097 --> 00:12:51.994\nWe're good.\n\n273\n00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:55.245\nBut if you don't even know\nwhat the outcome's gonna be,\n\n274\n00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:59.459\nyou can't verify what you know is\nsupposed to be the right result of this.\n\n275\n00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:02.252\nNow let's go ahead and\ntake a look as well.\n\n276\n00:13:02.252 --> 00:13:06.891\nThe other things that you also do is,\nlet's say, did you solve it?\n\n277\n00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:10.059\nIf you did solve the issue and\nit's working fine,\n\n278\n00:13:10.059 --> 00:13:13.920\nyou'll need to monitor this,\nof course, for days to come.\n\n279\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.508\nAnd you want to make sure that everybody\nhas this question in their mind.\n\n280\n00:13:18.508 --> 00:13:21.009\nOr that you put the question out.\n\n281\n00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.107\nI shouldn't say question, the statement.\n\n282\n00:13:23.107 --> 00:13:26.714\nYou should say something\nlike this to the people.\n\n283\n00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:30.562\nIf you're experiencing any difficulties or\nyou're seeing something that\n\n284\n00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:34.358\nseems strange that you haven't\nexperienced before, please let me know.\n\n285\n00:13:34.358 --> 00:13:37.709\nThat way you can know whether or\nnot you actually solved it.\n\n286\n00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:41.708\nGo back and start making your document.\n\n287\n00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:46.024\nMake sure that you documented your steps\nat solving it and then your backup.\n\n288\n00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:50.029\nYou're essentially creating\na database that makes it easier for\n\n289\n00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.688\nyou next time if you run into\nan issue that is similar or not.\n\n290\n00:13:53.688 --> 00:13:55.624\nNow what if you don't solve?\n\n291\n00:13:55.624 --> 00:13:57.083\nIf you do not solve this,\n\n292\n00:13:57.083 --> 00:14:01.117\nremember that you want to be\ntroubleshooting the original problem,\n\n293\n00:14:01.117 --> 00:14:05.932\nnot the problem that Ronnie might have\ncreated by troubleshooting 15 steps in.\n\n294\n00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:08.048\nAnd then when you go, okay,\nRonnie, what did you do?\n\n295\n00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:10.280\nI go, I can't remember.\n\n296\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.117\nI don't know,\nI tried everything underneath the sun.\n\n297\n00:14:13.117 --> 00:14:16.187\nAnd now Daniel's going,\nwhat do you mean by that?\n\n298\n00:14:16.187 --> 00:14:20.325\nI might have been at the keyboard for 25,\n30 minutes trying different commands.\n\n299\n00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:23.227\nNow Daniel's just kind of scratching,\nhe's like, are you joking?\n\n300\n00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:25.027\nWhy would you do that?\n\n301\n00:14:25.027 --> 00:14:28.452\nWell, this is where it\nreally does help us.\n\n302\n00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:33.245\nDuring that implementation process, as\nwe're starting to implement corrections,\n\n303\n00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.434\nonly do one at a time.\n\n304\n00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:36.316\nAnd test and verify.\n\n305\n00:14:36.316 --> 00:14:40.932\nIf it's not solved, remove that fix and\nthen come back and see if it's solved.\n\n306\n00:14:40.932 --> 00:14:44.472\nIf it is, then you document and\ngo all right, that's the right answer.\n\n307\n00:14:44.472 --> 00:14:47.624\nBut if it's not,\nremove the fix, that's the key.\n\n308\n00:14:47.624 --> 00:14:51.097\nYou're also gonna need to realize\nsomething that most of us don't want to\n\n309\n00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:51.609\nadmit to.\n\n310\n00:14:51.609 --> 00:14:53.810\nYou may have to escalate this issue.\n\n311\n00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.127\nThat means for some people,\nit's like, all right,\n\n312\n00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:59.937\nwho do I need to call that\ncan help me out here?\n\n313\n00:14:59.937 --> 00:15:02.529\nDaniel's, that's the international symbol,\nCisco Tech, that's who you call.\n\n314\n00:15:02.529 --> 00:15:03.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n315\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Listen, you pay them good money, and\n\n316\n00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:06.914\nguess what they will do for you?\n\n317\n00:15:06.914 --> 00:15:08.015\nThey will fix your problem.\n\n318\n00:15:08.015 --> 00:15:09.539\n&gt;&gt; They will fix your problem.\n\n319\n00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:10.703\nAnd that is not a bad answer.\n\n320\n00:15:10.703 --> 00:15:11.592\n&gt;&gt; No it is not.\n\n321\n00:15:11.592 --> 00:15:12.936\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n322\n00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:14.850\npractically it's not a bad answer.\n\n323\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.331\nOn the exam, though,\nfollow this step right here.\n\n324\n00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:19.243\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Cisco Tech is not gonna\nbe one of the A, B, C or Ds.\n\n325\n00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:21.143\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well if it is,\n\n326\n00:15:21.143 --> 00:15:22.026\nit would be neat, but it's not.\n\n327\n00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:22.626\n&gt;&gt; Then choose it.\n\n328\n00:15:22.626 --> 00:15:24.002\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Choose it, yeah.\n\n329\n00:15:24.002 --> 00:15:25.820\nCuz those guys,\nthat's all they do for a living,\n\n330\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.129\nthey eat this stuff for [CROSSTALK].\n\n331\n00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:30.681\nYeah, no big deal, let me just\nconnect in there and it's done.\n\n332\n00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:31.657\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n333\n00:15:31.657 --> 00:15:35.062\n&gt;&gt; And you go, thank you and\nthan you're off and ready to go.\n\n334\n00:15:35.062 --> 00:15:37.791\nBut a lot of times you might have\nto escalate this to the next level.\n\n335\n00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:40.193\nWhoever your service level agreement is,\n\n336\n00:15:40.193 --> 00:15:42.737\nI've tried everything\nthat I know how to do.\n\n337\n00:15:42.737 --> 00:15:46.061\nAnd once you escalate that, a lot of\ntimes people can find it a lot easier.\n\n338\n00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:48.984\nA fresh set of eyes does help everything.\n\n339\n00:15:48.984 --> 00:15:54.329\nSo these are the basic things that we\nwant to make sure that we do remember.\n\n340\n00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:57.928\nRemember the isolating problems here,\nimplementing corrections,\n\n341\n00:15:57.928 --> 00:16:01.771\nverifying income, that pretty much is\na big part of everything that we do.\n\n342\n00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:05.144\nAnd here are kind of the basic\nmethodologies that help us to begin.\n\n343\n00:16:05.144 --> 00:16:05.823\nOkay?\n\n344\n00:16:05.823 --> 00:16:08.910\nNow that we have this, remember.\n\n345\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.570\nThis only really helps if you have a solid\nfoundational knowledge in the OSI model.\n\n346\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.080\nTrying to do this without it.\n\n347\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.140\nCan it be done?\nYes.\n\n348\n00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:16.790\nOkay.\n\n349\n00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.140\nBut it takes you a lot longer.\n\n350\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.490\nInstead of you going, all right,\nso what's my next approach?\n\n351\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.600\nLayer two, everything's working well.\n\n352\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.815\nWhat do I chose you next?\n\n353\n00:16:23.815 --> 00:16:24.880\nCuz it's still not fixed.\n\n354\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.253\nNow if you don't know,\nyou just don't know.\n\n355\n00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:30.940\nSo that's why it helps for\nyou to have that foundational knowledge.\n\n356\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.150\nAnd just about everybody in networking\nuses an approach like this, right?\n\n357\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.720\nBasing itself around the OSI model and\nworking through it,\n\n358\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.380\nbecause it's all about networking.\n\n359\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.540\nThat's what the OSI\nmodel is designed to do.\n\n360\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.030\nSo why not use the tool\nthat's available to us.\n\n361\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.450\nAll right, so Daniel, now that we've\ngot that, let's take a look, possibly,\n\n362\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.050\nat some of the different scenarios.\n\n363\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.990\nLet me see if I can actually\nget to our machines here.\n\n364\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.230\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n365\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.000\nSo we're gonna be using practice labs,\nand there is a lab set up for\n\n366\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.380\nus, to be able to do this,\nlet me see, it's called,\n\n367\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.830\nTroubleshooting Methodologies\nIntroduction.\n\n368\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:06.750\nIt's gonna walk you through,\n\n369\n00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.260\npretty much everything that we've\nalso talked about here already.\n\n370\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.600\nBut then,\nbeginning on the second page here,\n\n371\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.220\nyou actually get into\nthe troubleshooting methodologies, and\n\n372\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.690\nto the model,\nin what they want us to be able to do.\n\n373\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.290\nLet me see if I can move this back over.\n\n374\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.740\nI forgot I just had to click on that.\n\n375\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.428\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And, actually works.\n\n376\n00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:30.596\nOkay so, let's start with the task.\n\n377\n00:17:30.596 --> 00:17:34.170\nNow let's start with the top\ndown approach, first.\n\n378\n00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.080\nSo here's the scenario that we have.\n\n379\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.740\nSo what we have is, that we have users\nthat are unable to reach an intranet\n\n380\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.990\nwebsite, found at 192.168.16.1.\n\n381\n00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.776\nSo let's go ahead, and one of the first\nthings that you want to try and\n\n382\n00:17:50.776 --> 00:17:54.629\ndo if you can, if somebody's\ncomplaining about that, is just try and\n\n383\n00:17:54.629 --> 00:17:56.547\nrecreate the problems yourself.\n\n384\n00:17:56.547 --> 00:18:00.157\nNow this is true whether you're\nsitting at your own workstation, or\n\n385\n00:18:00.157 --> 00:18:03.570\nwhether you go to the end user\ngroup station and use it.\n\n386\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.742\nYou just ask them, what do you type in\nto make sure that you get connected.\n\n387\n00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:11.320\nAm gonna select my internet explorer here,\nat least I think I am.\n\n388\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.980\nI have to double click on it, there we go.\n\n389\n00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.360\nAnd here it is, it's connecting now.\n\n390\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.290\nThis is not the page that they\ncan't get to, so we have that one.\n\n391\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:28.866\nBut they're actually saying is,\n192.168.16.1, so if I type in HTTP, oops.\n\n392\n00:18:28.866 --> 00:18:34.295\nMaybe, colon, and then two question marks.\n\n393\n00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:35.401\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slash slash.\n\n394\n00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.875\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's a new\nsyntax you've got there, Ronnie.\n\n395\n00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:39.594\n&gt;&gt; I know, I make it up all the time.\n\n396\n00:18:39.594 --> 00:18:42.640\n16.1, and then I press Enter.\n\n397\n00:18:44.322 --> 00:18:48.215\nNow, we're waiting on the website to\nconnect, and we just got to wait.\n\n398\n00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:52.740\nAnd at this point, I would realize at\nsomething else is the issue, okay.\n\n399\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.120\nSo how do I take this from\nthe top down approach?\n\n400\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.282\nWell what is my browser telling me, it's\ntelling me the browser, that application\n\n401\n00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:07.170\nitself cannot actually get to this site,\nor display whatever's on this site.\n\n402\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.205\nSo at this point,\nis it just an application issue?\n\n403\n00:19:10.205 --> 00:19:14.415\nWell I could continue to try and verify\nthat, right, by going to another website,\n\n404\n00:19:14.415 --> 00:19:16.240\nbut I found out something.\n\n405\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.610\nThis other intranet site is working\njust fine, okay, but this one,\n\n406\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.390\nthough, Daniel, is not.\n\n407\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.023\nSo now, I've narrowed itself down to\neither this one intranet website,\n\n408\n00:19:26.023 --> 00:19:30.253\nokay, or is something maybe dealing with\nmy machine and the application I'm using-\n\n409\n00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:30.884\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n410\n00:19:30.884 --> 00:19:33.465\n&gt;&gt; So I might even try,\nI could try another browser,\n\n411\n00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:37.707\nI could do whatever I wanted to, to see if\nthis is what's happening at this point,\n\n412\n00:19:37.707 --> 00:19:39.400\nis what we're seeing.\n\n413\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.070\nSo now, once we get to that, okay?\n\n414\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:47.130\nLet's go ahead and try to remember, what\nare some of things that has to be done,\n\n415\n00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.500\nif I am going to try to\nconnect to this website?\n\n416\n00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.201\nMe opening up a browser,\nis establishing that connection, but\n\n417\n00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:59.300\nI established it using,\nAn IP address right here.\n\n418\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.190\nSo let's see if we can connect\nusing an IP address, instead.\n\n419\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.740\nI have to kind of zoom out here for\njust a moment.\n\n420\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:14.299\nCuz, it once it locks itself in place,\nit doesn't like doing anything.\n\n421\n00:20:14.299 --> 00:20:20.062\nSo from here,\nI'm going to ping 192.168.16.1,\n\n422\n00:20:20.062 --> 00:20:23.656\nand let's see what we get as an answer.\n\n423\n00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:28.958\nAll right, so that's actually not showing\nyou anything, that's good, right, Daniel?\n\n424\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Nope, that's bad-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n425\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.974\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're looking to\nhave connectivity with 192168161.\n\n426\n00:20:34.974 --> 00:20:37.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is where paying\nattention to some of the ways,\n\n427\n00:20:37.976 --> 00:20:40.620\nthis stuff is displayed can help you out.\n\n428\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.890\nRequest timed out normally means,\nI'm not actually getting anything, okay?\n\n429\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:45.470\n&gt;&gt; No replies.\n\n430\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.590\n&gt;&gt; No reply at all.\n\n431\n00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.352\nSo it's not like it's sending me back\n\n432\n00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:51.977\nanother messages, to say-\n&gt;&gt; Firewall's not\n\n433\n00:20:51.977 --> 00:20:52.800\ndropping-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n434\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.113\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Once you get to the firewall,\n\n435\n00:20:54.113 --> 00:20:57.800\nit might say, firewall dropped it, but\nwhat it gives you, it sounds like, look.\n\n436\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.920\nIs out there, or I'm just not\nletting you reach it, or something.\n\n437\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.000\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n438\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.610\nSo you'll get that, but here,\nwe're not getting anything.\n\n439\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.120\nAnd if you do see something different,\n\n440\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.280\nlike it says, four packets sent, and\nthen received, but it's still telling you\n\n441\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.720\nit's unreachable, or something-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that destination host unreachable\n\n442\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.520\nmessage you get.\n\n443\n00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.311\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd then you know,\n\n444\n00:21:13.311 --> 00:21:15.154\nit's like, something is blocking me.\n\n445\n00:21:15.154 --> 00:21:15.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n446\n00:21:15.682 --> 00:21:17.671\nSomebody else replied, so you know that,\n\n447\n00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:20.120\nwhich is great, but\nnot the right device replied.\n\n448\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.110\nAnd that's where you start\nto begin to see things.\n\n449\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.180\nAll right, so Daniel,\nthis is actually telling me that, okay?\n\n450\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.600\nThat hey, I need to check something out.\n\n451\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.827\nIf layer three is not working-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n452\n00:21:30.827 --> 00:21:34.460\n&gt;&gt; That means that it might not have\ngotten even onto the wire here, and\n\n453\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.601\nstarted to actually do a couple things,\nso we might need to go ahead and test,\n\n454\n00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:42.870\neither the data link layer, or\nthe physical layer, as well.\n\n455\n00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.110\nSo what can you do?\n\n456\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.310\nWell for us,\n\n457\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.600\nwe already showed you that we're already\nconnected to another intranet site.\n\n458\n00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.900\nSo I know the NIC is good.\n\n459\n00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.547\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's probably not at my end,\n\n460\n00:21:53.547 --> 00:21:56.201\nbut there are devices inbetween me, and\n\n461\n00:21:56.201 --> 00:22:01.026\nthe host that I'm trying to get to,\nthat I want to check out here.\n\n462\n00:22:01.026 --> 00:22:04.450\nSo what we are going to do, is we're\ngonna take a look at this, I thought\n\n463\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.260\nI was gonna take a look at the topology,\nand that's what we want to do here.\n\n464\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.410\nLet me see if I can get to it.\n\n465\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My tabs are too tiny.\n\n466\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:13.627\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Just 2,000 tabs.\n\n467\n00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:18.854\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know that's quite a few tabs\nI've created here, for this first domain.\n\n468\n00:22:18.854 --> 00:22:22.110\nBut here's the basic apology\nthat we're looking at, okay.\n\n469\n00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.975\nSo right now, I'm on this machine down\nhere on the lower left hand corner,\n\n470\n00:22:26.975 --> 00:22:28.842\n19216816.10.\n\n471\n00:22:28.842 --> 00:22:32.623\nAnd what its saying,\nis that on the NY edge over here,\n\n472\n00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:37.780\nthe way that it's labeled,\nis I have this IP address on this one.\n\n473\n00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.800\nSo what I wanna do is, I wanna connect\nthrough this NY access switch, and\n\n474\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.760\nthen the NY core switch, and\ngo to NY edge over here.\n\n475\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.260\nAnd there should be a web page,\nor a web server, over here,\n\n476\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.980\non this particular router,\nwhich is very possible.\n\n477\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.120\nSo where do I go and troubleshoot?\n\n478\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.120\nIf this is my network, which it is,\nsince I'm on the same network,\n\n479\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.930\nas what this IP address is on.\n\n480\n00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.400\nI would probably at this point go,\nwhat a minute.\n\n481\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.800\nIt's not my end.\n\n482\n00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.801\nI could begin by pinging\nthings along the path, too.\n\n483\n00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:11.113\nSo I could actually try and ping this\ndevice, if I had an IP address on it, or\n\n484\n00:23:11.113 --> 00:23:14.064\nthis one,\nsee how far I get before anything drops.\n\n485\n00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:17.424\nI went ahead and pinged, and\nthis guy's not responding at all.\n\n486\n00:23:17.424 --> 00:23:24.160\nSo what we would do then, or\nwhat I would do, I can get to it.\n\n487\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.560\nIs I would just go directly to NY edge.\n\n488\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.190\nAnd let's just do some verification here,\nof the interfaces that we're seeing.\n\n489\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.975\nAnd let me zoom back in.\n\n490\n00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:35.750\nCuz I always forget this,\nuntil we start there.\n\n491\n00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.170\nI think that actually works, fairly well.\n\n492\n00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.720\nSo let me go ahead, and\nhit Enter a couple of times here.\n\n493\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.986\nMaybe, there we go.\n\n494\n00:23:41.986 --> 00:23:43.482\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; That was neat.\n\n495\n00:23:43.482 --> 00:23:44.300\n&gt;&gt; Fun.\n\n496\n00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\na little bit of a strobe effect for us.\n\n497\n00:23:46.202 --> 00:23:47.263\n&gt;&gt; Could be doing some trouble shooting\nhere in a second, or something else.\n\n498\n00:23:47.263 --> 00:23:51.460\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nas I stroke out from the light here.\n\n499\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.205\nNow, from this point,\nI want to take a look at the interfaces.\n\n500\n00:23:55.205 --> 00:24:01.737\nSo we're gonna do a show\nIP interface brief.\n\n501\n00:24:01.737 --> 00:24:06.230\nAnd let's see if that tells us a little\nbit of what we want to, did I?\n\n502\n00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.210\nI did zoom in to that, yeah,\n\n503\n00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.520\nI did zoom in a little bit, okay, I just\nwanted to make sure that I did that.\n\n504\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.070\nNow what I'm looking at, I'm actually\nstarting to see something already, Daniel.\n\n505\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.409\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Proper IP address is there, but\n\n506\n00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:21.060\nnow it says manually set, so\nI know I statically assigned it.\n\n507\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.670\nDaniel, let's look at the status and\nthe protocol.\n\n508\n00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.217\nRemember that when we take a look at this\nnow, this is not just that it's off.\n\n509\n00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:31.105\nRight, this means that\nsomebody has hard set it and\n\n510\n00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:34.500\nshut it off when you see\nadministratively down.\n\n511\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.494\nSo Daniel, if it's off,\n\n512\n00:24:35.494 --> 00:24:37.630\nwhat are the chances it's\ngonna reply back to me at all?\n\n513\n00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Zero to none.\n\n514\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.555\n&gt;&gt; Zero to none.\n\n515\n00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:43.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty much the idea here,\n\n516\n00:24:43.003 --> 00:24:45.659\nso it could be something\njust as simple as that.\n\n517\n00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:49.240\nAnd every once in awhile, we started\noff with what, with the browser.\n\n518\n00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.150\nAnd then when we realized we couldn't\nget the connection that we needed to,\n\n519\n00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.650\nwe needed to actually\ngo to that next layer.\n\n520\n00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.430\nSo we take the TCP/IP model,\n\n521\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.760\nright, the browser's saying,\nI can't get access to it.\n\n522\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.690\nWell, at that point,\nI go down lower, right, so\n\n523\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.360\nif I didn't solve the problem\nat the browser level,\n\n524\n00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.040\nwhere it couldn't be done, then for\nus, next would be the transport layer.\n\n525\n00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.790\nWell, I'm not really able to judge that,\nso I now need to go down to the network\n\n526\n00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.440\nlayer in the TCP/IP model, that's when\nwe saw the IP address in the browser.\n\n527\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.197\nI've now taken that IP address, and\nwe tried to ping it at layer three,\n\n528\n00:25:22.197 --> 00:25:23.775\nit was unresponsive as well.\n\n529\n00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:27.980\nWhich now led me to say, all right, there\nis a couple things that can happen here.\n\n530\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.500\nEither that web server is down and\nnot responding, or it's my machine.\n\n531\n00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.630\nThen when I verified it,\n\n532\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.970\nremember when I said we already\nconnected to another Internet address.\n\n533\n00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.230\nSo I know the browser's working at\nthe application level, I know that\n\n534\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.954\nit's actually not the NIC itself because\nit's also getting information, and\n\n535\n00:25:44.954 --> 00:25:46.810\non another IP address, it's working.\n\n536\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.097\nSo this isolated me down to actually say,\nlet's move on and\n\n537\n00:25:50.097 --> 00:25:53.004\nlet's troubleshoot at 192.168 16.1.\n\n538\n00:25:53.004 --> 00:25:57.766\nThis is where a good network topology\ndiagram's going to logically help\n\n539\n00:25:57.766 --> 00:26:01.240\nyou lay this out in your\nmind to troubleshoot.\n\n540\n00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.168\nAnd that's what led me right\nhere to NYEDGE1, okay?\n\n541\n00:26:03.168 --> 00:26:07.924\nSo once I have this,\nnow we are ready to go ahead and\n\n542\n00:26:07.924 --> 00:26:11.260\ndo a corrective issue, okay?\n\n543\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:16.114\nSo for us, we are going to start off\nwith configure terminal to get into\n\n544\n00:26:16.114 --> 00:26:19.834\nour global configuration\nmode from privilege exec.\n\n545\n00:26:19.834 --> 00:26:24.443\nOnce I'm here, I need the interface, and\n\n546\n00:26:24.443 --> 00:26:27.906\nthen gigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n547\n00:26:27.906 --> 00:26:32.575\nAnd I don't have to type\nin another IP address,\n\n548\n00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:35.736\nI just need to issue a no shutdown\n\n549\n00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.937\nAnd then show ip interface brief.\n\n550\n00:26:43.937 --> 00:26:46.468\nNow even before I try and\nmanually verify it,\n\n551\n00:26:46.468 --> 00:26:49.760\nnotice what the sys log\nmessages are telling me.\n\n552\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.081\nIs that it actually changed\nits state to down exit,\n\n553\n00:26:53.081 --> 00:26:55.254\nwhich is kind of a neat one there.\n\n554\n00:26:55.254 --> 00:27:02.317\nBut now it went from that to up, okay, so\nI know now this interface is responding.\n\n555\n00:27:02.317 --> 00:27:06.660\nAnd then,\nby typing in the show ip interface brief,\n\n556\n00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.080\nI can now see that the status is up up.\n\n557\n00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.496\nRemember for us, status at this level\nmeans the link light is up on a NIC.\n\n558\n00:27:14.496 --> 00:27:18.323\nAnd then the protocol means activity,\nso the boinking light on a NIC.\n\n559\n00:27:18.323 --> 00:27:23.610\nThat's how I always see it now because\nit just makes it easy for me to do this.\n\n560\n00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.272\nSo did I solve the issue,\nwell, let's check.\n\n561\n00:27:26.272 --> 00:27:30.279\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna actually be super\nimpressed if an Internet site comes\n\n562\n00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:33.015\nup, because the IP address\nis on the interface of\n\n563\n00:27:33.015 --> 00:27:35.620\na router\n&gt;&gt; Unless the router is serving up a web\n\n564\n00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.135\npage, which I'm guessing it's doing,\ndo Cisco routers actually do that?\n\n565\n00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:43.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they can actually serve\nup a web page, they sure can.\n\n566\n00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.626\nYeah, now the web page is not for you to\nkind of design and put something up there.\n\n567\n00:27:47.626 --> 00:27:51.707\nUsually the web page is designed for\nyou to connect to it, so\n\n568\n00:27:51.707 --> 00:27:55.554\nthat you can manually\nadministrate the router itself.\n\n569\n00:27:55.554 --> 00:27:56.102\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n570\n00:27:56.102 --> 00:27:59.730\nlet's check it out and\nsee what happens as we do this.\n\n571\n00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.450\nI need to go back to the lab\nmachine that I was on and\n\n572\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.390\nalso, gonna see if I can\nbring up the browser again.\n\n573\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.060\nSo we already know that we can connect\nto this one they've named Internet.\n\n574\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.650\nAnd this is actually from Practice Labs,\n\n575\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.840\nso you can get access\nto some of the files.\n\n576\n00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.219\nWe'll be using that in the future\nin other episodes, here.\n\n577\n00:28:18.219 --> 00:28:23.724\nThen http, oops, so much for\n\n578\n00:28:23.724 --> 00:28:28.618\nthat, Now Daniel,\n\n579\n00:28:28.618 --> 00:28:34.645\nthe other method, right, that I should\nbe thinking about even before I do this,\n\n580\n00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:39.630\nbecause I'm going to do this thing\nbackward if I don't, is this.\n\n581\n00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.553\nOkay now, I should just bring this up,\nverify first, right?\n\n582\n00:28:44.553 --> 00:28:48.816\n&gt;&gt; This is giving you verification that\nthose lower layers are working fine.\n\n583\n00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:52.704\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, see, I just jumped right\ninto the layer seven [CROSSTALK] because I\n\n584\n00:28:52.704 --> 00:28:54.090\nwas like, no big deal.\n\n585\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.635\nBut now that I have everything working,\n\n586\n00:28:55.635 --> 00:28:57.686\nI wanna verify that that's\nactually working first.\n\n587\n00:28:57.686 --> 00:29:00.491\n&gt;&gt; Now that would be a shortcut,\nyou could do that and see,\n\n588\n00:29:00.491 --> 00:29:04.140\ncuz if you do get a web page,\nthen everything below that is working.\n\n589\n00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthat is the absolute truth, and\n\n590\n00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.960\nmost of us would just do that anyways,\njust to go ahead and check here.\n\n591\n00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.430\nLet's see if this actually\ndoes end up working.\n\n592\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:18.120\nI've opened up so many tabs now, I've\nforgot, and everything is smaller now too.\n\n593\n00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.821\nSo let me close all that out, and\nthen we'll use this one that's open here.\n\n594\n00:29:21.821 --> 00:29:27.063\nLet's see, no, I've gotta,\nwe'll just check here,\n\n595\n00:29:27.063 --> 00:29:30.820\nand then I'll zoom in in just a moment.\n\n596\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.949\nLet me type it in, 192.168.16.1.\n\n597\n00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:41.790\nAll right, now let me zoom back in,\nI can't do it on that page.\n\n598\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.100\nI gotta come back over here for\njust a moment, and then I can zoom in and\n\n599\n00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.049\nshow you the results.\n\n600\n00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.357\nNow, Daniel it doesn't look\nlike the web page came up, but\n\n601\n00:29:51.357 --> 00:29:52.725\nI am now certain of something.\n\n602\n00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:54.443\n&gt;&gt; That's because it's asking you for\n\n603\n00:29:54.443 --> 00:29:57.350\nsecurity credentials before it\nallows you go to the web page.\n\n604\n00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:03.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now I know something, right,\nfrom this IP, this server is asking.\n\n605\n00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:08.030\nSo that now means what, that this\naddress and this web server, it's there.\n\n606\n00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.430\nIt is replying,\n\n607\n00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.550\nit is doing what it needs to do here,\nokay, so that's what it's doing.\n\n608\n00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.744\nIt says, server reports that it\nis from level 15 access as well.\n\n609\n00:30:17.744 --> 00:30:21.232\nSo it gives a little bit more in like,\nhey, this is what's happening,\n\n610\n00:30:21.232 --> 00:30:21.999\nthat's fine.\n\n611\n00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:26.140\nIf I click Cancel, just for a moment,\ncuz I don't really need it right now.\n\n612\n00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:33.050\nNotice what else it says, unauthorized,\nso I know that the website is up.\n\n613\n00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.570\nBut right now, the only thing it's telling\nme is that I'm not allowed to see it,\n\n614\n00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.730\nI am not authorized to\nbe able to see this.\n\n615\n00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.460\nSo that is kinda one of the methods\nthat we can actually take a look at.\n\n616\n00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.670\nNow Daniel, we do need to go\nthrough just a couple of more.\n\n617\n00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.570\nWe need to go through the bottom up and\n\n618\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.320\nthen we'll talk about the divide and\nconquer just briefly.\n\n619\n00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.336\nBut Daniel,\nit looks like I've run out of time and\n\n620\n00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:56.075\nprobably even a little bit over that time.\n\n621\n00:30:56.075 --> 00:30:59.560\nSo let's go ahead and end this episode\nhere and we'll pick up from this point.\n\n622\n00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.932\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, not a problem,\nwe look forward to seeing you there,\n\n623\n00:31:01.932 --> 00:31:03.286\nlook forward to seeing you there as well.\n\n624\n00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:07.012\nBut as the man said, we are out of time,\nso join us back for part three, and\n\n625\n00:31:07.012 --> 00:31:10.305\nsee how Ronniestiltskin over here\ncontinues to spin that gold.\n\n626\n00:31:10.305 --> 00:31:11.387\n&gt;&gt;

And we'll see you next time.\n\n629\n00:31:18.932 --> 00:31:22.204\n[MUSIC]\n\n630\n00:31:22.204 --> 00:31:24.462\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:06.518\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:08.014\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:12.060\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.940\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n9\n00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.770\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more in our CCENT series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.980\nJoining us in the studio the man,\nthe myth, the legend,\n\n11\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.760\nthe master blaster himself,\none Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.480\nRonnie, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.550\n&gt;&gt; It's going well Daniel, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n14\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.502\nAs we continue on in our little\ntroubleshooting lab here,\n\n15\n00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:40.140\ntrying to make sure we cover the bases\nof some of the most identifiable\n\n16\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.090\ntypes of approaches in\ntroubleshooting methodology.\n\n17\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.160\nWe've just went through,\nof course, the top-down method and\n\n18\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.110\nnow we're gonna approach it\na little bit differently as well.\n\n19\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.310\nWhich is, of course,\ngoing back through and\n\n20\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.866\nnow taking it from\nthe bottom-up method as well.\n\n21\n00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.650\nSo being able to actually\nkind of pace ourselves and\n\n22\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.670\nunderstand what we're actually\ndoing is kind of the key.\n\n23\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.930\nSo the initial one right,\n\n24\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.560\nwe found out that we couldn't get\naccess to an intranet website.\n\n25\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.840\nWe found where that is, and\nthen once we corrected the issue,\n\n26\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.566\neverything was good and\nnow we are ready to move on.\n\n27\n00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.920\nSo in our second task here, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.390\nWe have a scenario that says users have\nbeen complaining that they're unable to\n\n29\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.787\nconnect to the Internet at all,\n\n30\n00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:23.530\nokay, and all other internal network\nresources are still available.\n\n31\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.490\nHowever, we actually need\nto troubleshoot that.\n\n32\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.742\nSo everybody is essentially saying,\nthe Internet is broken, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:34.100\nThat is pretty much what we have to\nactually be able to see, and do, and\n\n34\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.760\njust verify.\n\n35\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.770\nBecause if not, we're gonna be in big\ntrouble here as we start with the idea\n\n36\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.340\nof the issues that we have, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.010\nSo the bottom-up approach for us, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.770\nIf we were to talk about trying\nto do this at the physical layer.\n\n39\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.310\nThis would kind of lead us to back to\nwhat we were saying a little bit earlier,\n\n40\n00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.370\nare we checking cables at this point?\n\n41\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.070\nAre we checking the actual\nlights on the NIC?\n\n42\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.290\nVerifying that everything is good, or even\non the router or whatever it might be,\n\n43\n00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.800\nwhatever device that we're on,\n\n44\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.740\nwe're just trying to verify that\nthose connections are good.\n\n45\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.990\nThat's always a great place to begin.\n\n46\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.080\nAnd since I told you where I normally\nbegin when users start telling me\n\n47\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.380\nthe issues, I always start with the\nphysical layer as much as possible, and\n\n48\n00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.420\ntry and troubleshoot at that point.\n\n49\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.020\nIf I determine that it's more than one\nindividual that's facing that issue and\n\n50\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.890\nhere we're given the scenario that\nit's all users that are complaining\n\n51\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.670\nthat they can't get to the Internet.\n\n52\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.470\nWell then, I have to actually start to try\nand find out, what is common between all\n\n53\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.690\nthose users that we might think about\nhere and we might begin to troubleshoot?\n\n54\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.000\nSo I know that maybe the physical\nlayer is probably not gonna be\n\n55\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.140\nthe issue at this point.\n\n56\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.230\nThey can get access to intranet sites.\n\n57\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.720\nBut now it's also, essentially,\nthe Internet, right?\n\n58\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.180\nSo for us, we really know that\nthat's not gonna be layer one.\n\n59\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.570\nIt's not gonna be layer two,\ninternally, right?\n\n60\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.960\nIf we start having issues getting access,\n\n61\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.020\nwe know that most of the devices\ncommunicate using MAC addresses.\n\n62\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.360\nSo that's layer two,\nthey're saying internal things, it works.\n\n63\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.296\nBut now we're starting to deal with\nlayer three issues, once again,\n\n64\n00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.799\nis where we begin to troubleshoot.\n\n65\n00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.759\nNow, before we do that,\nokay, let's start with\n\n66\n00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.422\nthat idea that we think that it's\nsomething that's happening on the router.\n\n67\n00:03:15.422 --> 00:03:19.023\nSo how do we troubleshoot on the router,\nokay, if we need to?\n\n68\n00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:20.873\nWell, we know we can look at the lights,\nbut\n\n69\n00:03:20.873 --> 00:03:24.150\nis there some place that gives us\na little bit more information?\n\n70\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.670\nYes there is, and\nyou do need to know about it, so\n\n71\n00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.270\nwe'll show you that command right now.\n\n72\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.166\nOkay, let's take a look at my\ndiagram before we get started here.\n\n73\n00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:38.784\nI've added in an IP address on NYEDGE\nover here, okay, and this is 172.14.0.1.\n\n74\n00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:40.920\nNow I say that, I've added it in.\n\n75\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.530\nThis has been preconfigured in the lab and\npractice labs so I didn't add it in.\n\n76\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.020\nThey went ahead and\npreconfigured it for us, and\n\n77\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.700\nthat's what's gonna be\nrepresenting our connection out to\n\n78\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.340\nthe Internet is what that\none's gonna be connecting to.\n\n79\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.400\nSo we're fine there.\n\n80\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.370\nWe still have essentially\nthe same topology here.\n\n81\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.180\nSo let's talk about this for\na moment, Daniel.\n\n82\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.220\nI'm gonna troubleshoot from right here and\nI wanna verify that all layer one and\n\n83\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.930\nlayer two issues are not\ngonna be present at all.\n\n84\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.550\nSo let's switch over to, if I can\nactually switch over, there we go.\n\n85\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.754\nTo my NYEDGE here, and\nnow, I didn't change it.\n\n86\n00:04:21.754 --> 00:04:23.290\nNo, that's actually changed and\nthat's correct.\n\n87\n00:04:25.318 --> 00:04:31.290\nHere on NYEDGE, let's begin a little bit\nof troubleshooting now that we're here.\n\n88\n00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.515\nWhat I want to do is I know I\ncan get to the default gateway.\n\n89\n00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:39.800\nWe've already pinged that before\nin our previous lab that we did.\n\n90\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.164\nNow we're actually going ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:46.745\nnow I want to get to the interface\nthat's connected to the Internet.\n\n92\n00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:50.312\nWhat I wanna do is,\nI wanna issue a show interface,\n\n93\n00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:57.868\nGigabit Ethernet 0/1.\n\n94\n00:04:57.868 --> 00:05:01.855\nThese particular types of show commands,\nespecially interface commands,\n\n95\n00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:06.280\nthey give you so much information,\nand it's good, valuable information.\n\n96\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.621\nEspecially when you're\nbeginning to troubleshoot, and\n\n97\n00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:12.629\nyou need information to be\nshown very quickly here.\n\n98\n00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.431\nYou can pretty much begin to troubleshoot\nalmost all the way through layer three\n\n99\n00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:18.369\nall together.\n\n100\n00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.210\nSo let's show you what\nwe're talking about.\n\n101\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.480\nRight away, Daniel, without me even\nbeing in the same room as the router,\n\n102\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.352\nI see this top line of\ninformation right here, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:30.970\nAnd it's exactly like I\ndescribed to you right?\n\n104\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.670\nIt says it's up and up.\n\n105\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.150\nLine protocol is up, the interface is up.\n\n106\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.910\nThis is the same as the link\nlight being on, and\n\n107\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.650\nthe activity light blinking on you're net.\n\n108\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.257\nSo, I get good confirmation,\nat least at layer one at this point,\n\n109\n00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:47.497\neverything looks good, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:53.683\nLayer two, well, it's reporting back to me\nit's particular BIA, or burned in address.\n\n111\n00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:58.770\nNow, I didn't spend any time talk\nabout the formatting of Mac addresses.\n\n112\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.162\nIn Cisco land, you may see them formatted\na little bit differently than what\n\n113\n00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:05.350\nyou're used to seeing if you come\nfrom the desktop support arena.\n\n114\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.040\nSo normally what we see is two digits,\neither a dash or\n\n115\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.650\na colon, and then two digits and\nyou go all the way down.\n\n116\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.185\nCisco, they like dividing it up into well,\nhere.\n\n117\n00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:18.876\nOkay so each one of these is\nactually a dot, and then of course,\n\n118\n00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:21.394\nyou have hexidecimal formats in between.\n\n119\n00:06:21.394 --> 00:06:26.009\nAnd, once again, each section\nrepresents 16 bits here, okay, so\n\n120\n00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.190\nthat is a 48 bit address.\n\n121\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.620\nNotice the term BIA, which is the other\nway that it was used to being know a lot\n\n122\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.260\nof times, burned in address,\n\n123\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.520\nthat's still there from the very beginning\nwhen bridges were coming around.\n\n124\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.702\nIt's still reporting it in the same\nmanner and fashion as well.\n\n125\n00:06:41.702 --> 00:06:45.150\nNotic, Daniel,\nI also have the layer three information.\n\n126\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.510\nNow, it's fairly simple, right?\n\n127\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.000\nWhat if I don't have\nthis configured correctly\n\n128\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.590\nthe way that my ISP said\nthat I should configure?\n\n129\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.770\nWell, that might be something I\nneed to troubleshoot at that point.\n\n130\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.827\nSo if I'm not sure, what if the ISP said,\nyou have to have it in this range, and\n\n131\n00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:01.404\nthat's not the actual range.\n\n132\n00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:05.134\nThat might be something for\nme to consider when I start taking a look.\n\n133\n00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:08.463\nBut right here it's just what,\nlayer one, layer two, and\n\n134\n00:07:08.463 --> 00:07:11.720\nlayer three information\nall from one command.\n\n135\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.720\nAnd this is a quick way to\nverify all of it very quickly if\n\n136\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.560\neverything is actually good.\n\n137\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.822\nNow from that particular point though.\n\n138\n00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:23.286\nOnce we start seeing it,\nwe also have to see some other things that\n\n139\n00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:28.169\nare also layer two issues that can\nhelp us, too, and layer one issues.\n\n140\n00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.330\nSo let's take a look at this line here.\n\n141\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.990\nNotice I also get more\nlayer one information.\n\n142\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.500\nMedia type, RJ-45 is a connector,\nand that is a layer one information.\n\n143\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.340\nThe other thing that\nwe're getting is speed.\n\n144\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.925\nOkay, 100 megabits and\nthen full duplex here as well.\n\n145\n00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:54.713\nNow we don't really talk about\nthis too often in today's devices,\n\n146\n00:07:54.713 --> 00:08:00.830\nbecause they automatically configure\na lot of times for duplex and for speed.\n\n147\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.628\nBut it used to be where you had to\nmanually configure some of these things.\n\n148\n00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:07.930\nAnd you had one side set at full duplex\nand the other end set at half duplex.\n\n149\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.757\nThings could go a little bit awry there.\n\n150\n00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:13.523\nAnd even with 10 megabits and\n100 megabits, they could work, but\n\n151\n00:08:13.523 --> 00:08:16.056\nyou might also see some packets drop,\nas well.\n\n152\n00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:17.715\nSo just be aware that you might see that.\n\n153\n00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:23.550\nBut for right now, we have that\ninformation for us as we start to see it.\n\n154\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.800\nAs I scroll down,\nlet me hit the space bar one more time.\n\n155\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.840\nI'm now beginning to look at the idea\nhere of this input queue, and\n\n156\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.290\nalso the term Total output drops.\n\n157\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:45.240\nSo is this a layer one issue\nwhere it's dropping frames okay?\n\n158\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.850\nOr layer two issues where it's actually\ndropping frames or anything else here?\n\n159\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.350\nWell notice that I've got 0 total drops,\nand\n\n160\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.847\nin the queue here it says I've\ngot a size of 0 to max of 40.\n\n161\n00:08:56.847 --> 00:09:00.730\nThere's nothing queued up cuz nothing's\nactually being sent here, so that's fine.\n\n162\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.850\nFive minute output is the rate,\nactually fine.\n\n163\n00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:09.030\nWhat we're looking at though is really\nbeginning in this section here.\n\n164\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.549\nWe're not looking for the live data,\nbut in this information at least,\n\n165\n00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:15.931\nactually if I go all the way down here.\n\n166\n00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:25.503\nDown to here, notice you're actually\nstarting to see things like runts, giants,\n\n167\n00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:32.740\nthrottles, input errors, CRC's, frames,\noverruns, ignored, watch dogs, multicast.\n\n168\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.280\nLet's see, output errors,\ncollisions, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.180\nNow, look, even babbles and\nlate collisions.\n\n170\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.000\nWhen you start seeing stuff like that.\n\n171\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.225\nDaniel, do any of those terms really\nsound like that they're good things,\n\n172\n00:09:46.225 --> 00:09:50.138\nlike the idea of a runt or a giant,\nin terms of frame sizes or anything?\n\n173\n00:09:50.138 --> 00:09:54.753\n&gt;&gt; No, probably not cuz they're, obviously\nthey are making some kind of demarkation\n\n174\n00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:57.031\nthat this is different than normal size.\n\n175\n00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:59.774\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and the same thing when you\nstart seeing babbles [LAUGH] and\n\n176\n00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:01.440\nlate collisions and stuff like that.\n\n177\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.444\nIt let's you know.\n\n178\n00:10:02.444 --> 00:10:03.575\n&gt;&gt; Babbles is awesome, apparently.\n\n179\n00:10:03.575 --> 00:10:04.546\nYeah, babbles is pretty awesome.\n\n180\n00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:05.884\n&gt;&gt; Yes, babbles is exactly what you want.\n\n181\n00:10:05.884 --> 00:10:06.724\nProbably not though.\n\n182\n00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:09.796\n&gt;&gt; So now we are actually seeing\nsomething else with the interface right?\n\n183\n00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:14.710\nThe interface is, at least at this point\nworking theoretically perfectly, right?\n\n184\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.550\nWe're not getting any of this kind\nof stuff that shows a corruption has\n\n185\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.390\nhappened.\n\n186\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.536\n&gt;&gt; There's no red flags\n[CROSSTALK] saying, hey,\n\n187\n00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:23.314\nmaybe there's an issue at this level.\n\n188\n00:10:23.314 --> 00:10:25.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're seeing what we would want to see.\n\n189\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now we can go, right.\n\n190\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.630\nSo layer one and pretty much layer two\nfrom what we can understand, cuz it's\n\n191\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.950\naccepting it, it's taking it, it's doing\nwhat it needs to, it's passing it through.\n\n192\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.981\nAnd nothing is actually kind of\nred flagging the way that want to.\n\n193\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.700\nSo that means we are going to\nstart moving up from that point.\n\n194\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.128\nWhich is going to be, well, layer three.\n\n195\n00:10:47.128 --> 00:10:51.809\nSo now that is what we need\nto begin to troubleshoot at.\n\n196\n00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:55.960\nSo the same thing as we move back\nto our other system over here.\n\n197\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.990\nAnd I'm gonna switch the,\nnow that I'm up at 150% here,\n\n198\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.250\nI'm gonna switch this back down for\na moment here.\n\n199\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.840\nSo let's ping that outside interface,\nokay?\n\n200\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.230\nNow remember that when you\ndo the idea of pings, right?\n\n201\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.350\nAlways pinging from inside\nout is kind of the key\n\n202\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.960\nif you want to keep that practice in mind.\n\n203\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.850\nVerify first that your machine is up so\nyou only ping your IP address.\n\n204\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.860\nThen the next device in line for us,\n\n205\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.120\nthat's going to be our default gateway,\nand then you ping out from there.\n\n206\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.380\nIf you choose to, or another device\non your network, and then outside.\n\n207\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.154\nBut I know that all those are actually\ngood i'm just goinna follow at least one\n\n208\n00:11:32.154 --> 00:11:35.767\nof those orders and\nverify I can get to my default gateway.\n\n209\n00:11:35.767 --> 00:11:38.925\nCuz I know it's on the other side of\nthis router that I may be having issue.\n\n210\n00:11:38.925 --> 00:11:40.665\nSo that shows me that I'm good.\n\n211\n00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:46.003\nAnd now, if I ping 172.14.0.1,\n\n212\n00:11:46.003 --> 00:11:51.060\nand I am now getting replies coming back.\n\n213\n00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.860\nSo actually, everything looks\npretty good at this point,\n\n214\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.829\nwhich means that I should\nhave connectivity.\n\n215\n00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:00.629\nShould actually not be blocking anything,\nbut\n\n216\n00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:03.719\nsomething else is going on\nthat's weird in our lab.\n\n217\n00:12:03.719 --> 00:12:05.950\nAnd I'm about to show you\nwhat's happening here.\n\n218\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.393\nAccording to lab steps,\nI should not be getting through, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:09.393 --> 00:12:10.825\nSo that's why I wanted to point this out.\n\n220\n00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:14.920\n&gt;&gt; So the problem is, is that this should\nbe segmented off and I have access to it.\n\n221\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.896\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so for some reason this should not\nbe working as it actually shows up here,\n\n222\n00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:24.830\nthat something else is happening\nthat's allowing it to come through.\n\n223\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.250\nNow just when say that, it's gotta be some\nfancy way that they've hooked up this\n\n224\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.947\nrouter and I'll show you why.\n\n225\n00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:34.107\nLet me go back to the router\nthat this is on, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:34.107 --> 00:12:37.350\nSo on the other side of this, right,\n\n227\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.744\nthat 172.14.0.1 is the IP\naddress on this interface, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:47.201\nSo I just showed you this, 14.1.\n\n229\n00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:54.209\nBut if I type in show running-config here.\n\n230\n00:12:56.866 --> 00:13:01.007\nAnd I scroll down, and I'm looking for\ninformation on that interface.\n\n231\n00:13:01.007 --> 00:13:05.043\nI'm gonna see something that I\nwas not expecting to see here.\n\n232\n00:13:05.043 --> 00:13:11.292\nThere is what is called an access\nlist on this interface, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:13.536\nNow we haven't gotten into access lists,\nokay?\n\n234\n00:13:13.536 --> 00:13:16.304\nAnd you'll get into that in the CCNA\nrouting and switching show.\n\n235\n00:13:16.304 --> 00:13:18.969\nBut we don't really get\ninto it at this point, but\n\n236\n00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:22.600\nthe idea of an access list is\nessentially a filter, okay.\n\n237\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.290\nThis particular one is saying,\n\n238\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.620\nhey, filter what is coming\nout of this interface, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.150\nLeaving this interface\nis what it's saying.\n\n240\n00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:37.430\nNow, if I continue to scroll down in the,\nwrong scroll button.\n\n241\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:44.876\nIf I click here and I hit the space bar,\nI will be able to see this access list,\n\n242\n00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:52.311\nWhich is right here, okay,\nso this was preconfigured.\n\n243\n00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:57.380\nWhat this access list is saying is access\nlist 20 which is was on the interface.\n\n244\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:04.760\nAnd it was outbound, saying leaving the\ninterface, notice it says deny anything.\n\n245\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.970\nSo it's saying,\nif it goes out of this interface, deny.\n\n246\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.334\nThe problem that we have is that it\nmight not actually be coming out of\n\n247\n00:14:12.334 --> 00:14:14.754\nthat interface,\nis what you're having right,\n\n248\n00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:17.131\nbecause this is on the other\nside of the router.\n\n249\n00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:21.305\nSo that's where we have to determine like,\ningress, and egress, and stuff like that.\n\n250\n00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:24.769\nBut somehow that directionality\nmay actually be the issue here.\n\n251\n00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:27.272\nI didn't change it because\nI want to see this for lab.\n\n252\n00:14:27.272 --> 00:14:31.522\nI will practice labs know that something\nis not working correctly here.\n\n253\n00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:35.820\nBut at this point I wanted you to see it,\njust in case you're still doing this and\n\n254\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.824\nit hasn't been corrected, right.\n\n255\n00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:41.670\nBut notice the second one,\nwhich says, hey,\n\n256\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:47.395\nallow everything to come\nthrough from 192.168.16.0.\n\n257\n00:14:47.395 --> 00:14:51.904\nAnd that should actually be, well okay,\nso that tells me why pings might be\n\n258\n00:14:51.904 --> 00:14:56.190\ngetting through except that\nthey're not supposed to be okay?\n\n259\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:01.260\nSo, how do I know that that's actually the\nissue at this point for us to get through?\n\n260\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:07.560\nSo it actually did end up working\nthe way that it should not have here.\n\n261\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.625\nSee if I can show you.\n\n262\n00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:13.986\nIf I type in a show IP access-list here,\n\n263\n00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:19.363\nyou can see something which is unusual.\n\n264\n00:15:19.363 --> 00:15:25.070\nSo, Daniel, if we kind of focus in on this\none, on the standard access list, 20 okay?\n\n265\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.506\nNotice what is actually getting\nmatched when I pinged it.\n\n266\n00:15:33.229 --> 00:15:38.219\nIt said the denies are getting matched,\nbut yet, I'm getting a reply\n\n267\n00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:43.390\nthat comes back even though\nI'm on the 192.168.16 network.\n\n268\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.115\nNotice that it doesn't actually\nhave anything in parenthesis\n\n269\n00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.904\nsaying that it returned\nto me four packets, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:50.904 --> 00:15:55.549\nSo somehow the denies are actually\nwhat's coming back to me, and\n\n271\n00:15:55.549 --> 00:15:59.773\neven though the permit statement\nallows me to do that Yeah,\n\n272\n00:15:59.773 --> 00:16:03.924\nI should be getting this back\nif that was the actual issue.\n\n273\n00:16:03.924 --> 00:16:06.417\nSo I don't know how they did this.\n\n274\n00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:07.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.400\n&gt;&gt; This is a.\n\n276\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.610\n&gt;&gt; This one's a little bit tricky for me.\n\n277\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.350\n&gt;&gt; As I started to look, I was like, well,\ndon't get me wrong, deny should come back.\n\n278\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.590\nBut if it comes back,\nit means that the router responded, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.090\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n280\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.985\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen it returns back the information,\n\n281\n00:16:19.985 --> 00:16:24.360\nlike the destination is there, but\nyou're not allowed to reach it.\n\n282\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.360\nOr destination host unreachable, is what\nshould get as reply that comes back.\n\n283\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.940\nSo this is where it doesn't make any\nsense in the way that this reply, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.850\nBecause in all honesty,\n\n285\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.470\nthis should not be replying right\nnow because that is still on there.\n\n286\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.320\nSo just kinda realized you may run into\nsome issues with the labs at some point.\n\n287\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.950\nBut for us here, that's what they have.\n\n288\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.402\nAnd the only thing that we're doing\nat this point is then removing that\n\n289\n00:16:52.402 --> 00:16:53.058\naccess list.\n\n290\n00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:56.760\nAnd it's working perfectly fine right now,\nin what they're actually showing,\n\n291\n00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.840\nwhich again I cannot explain.\n\n292\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.600\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's weird, but\n\n293\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.180\nthis should actually be where I would have\ngotten back destination host unreachable.\n\n294\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.747\nAnd from that point,\nonce that was actually done,\n\n295\n00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:10.662\nthen we would have actually fixed it.\n\n296\n00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:14.583\nBut here it is on that idea\nof what we're seeing, okay.\n\n297\n00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:16.618\nSo a little bit more unusual,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n298\n00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:19.591\n&gt;&gt; In that sense what's happening here,\nokay?\n\n299\n00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:25.840\nAll right, so that means now,\nwe can go ahead and move on through.\n\n300\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.850\nAnd take a look at our last step here,\nwhich is the idea of dividing and\n\n301\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.010\nconquering as well, okay?\n\n302\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:40.010\nNow, in this divide and conquer,\nI'm gonna go back to our,\n\n303\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:46.550\nlet's go one more time here,\nback to our diagram, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.860\nRight here, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.598\nThe other thing that has now\nhappened in the divide and conquer,\n\n306\n00:17:52.598 --> 00:17:57.890\nis that a junior administrator wants\nto connect to NYWAN1's router.\n\n307\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:03.110\nUsing the web interface to implement\nsome basic configuration changes, okay?\n\n308\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.020\nHe now informed you that he cannot do so.\n\n309\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.670\nAnd now we actually want to figure out\nwhat we can do to help them to make that\n\n310\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.198\napproach happen, okay.\n\n311\n00:18:11.198 --> 00:18:15.560\nSo let's verify from this\npoint here what we can do.\n\n312\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.329\nThe great thing is we know that hopefully\neverything is actually connecting.\n\n313\n00:18:19.329 --> 00:18:21.586\nWe'll start here at NYEDGE1,\n\n314\n00:18:21.586 --> 00:18:27.701\nlet's verify that we can just have\nconnectivity over to 192.168.16.3.\n\n315\n00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.111\nAnd let's see what we get as a reply or\nresponse.\n\n316\n00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:36.547\nNotice we actually did get\nthe reply back that we wanted to.\n\n317\n00:18:36.547 --> 00:18:40.385\nRemember that this very first one that\nit looks like it dropped with the period\n\n318\n00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:44.030\nthere is probably doing the ARP,\naddress resolution process.\n\n319\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.190\nTaking the IP address, changing it\nto the MAC, and then of course being\n\n320\n00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.160\nable to respond back and send the\ninformation back the way that we want to.\n\n321\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.210\nSo, that shows us that we are connecting\nso a great thing is we know that at least\n\n322\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.090\npings are getting through,\ngood connectivity.\n\n323\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.000\nBut they're trying to get\naccess to the web interface.\n\n324\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.460\nNow, there's a couple of ways where\nwe can try and troubleshoot this.\n\n325\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:10.158\nBut if I'm on this router,\nthe easiest way to actually do\n\n326\n00:19:10.158 --> 00:19:15.395\nthis instead,\nis to issue a command like this okay.\n\n327\n00:19:15.395 --> 00:19:19.073\ntelnet 192.168.16.3, and\n\n328\n00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:23.070\nthen I tell it to try and\nconnect on port 80.\n\n329\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.820\nSo I'm just using Telnet as\nan example of an application, okay,\n\n330\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.260\nthat's all I'm doing.\n\n331\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.300\nBut I'm telling Telnet,\ninstead of using the regular port 23,\n\n332\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.718\nif I remember it correctly,\nport 23, to use port 23.\n\n333\n00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.996\nI'm saying try and\nconnect in that port 80, and\n\n334\n00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:43.830\nlet's see what happens here, all right.\n\n335\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.510\nNow it says it's trying.\n\n336\n00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.570\nAnd it says connection has been\nrefused by the remote host.\n\n337\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.650\nNow, this is very interesting for\nus because, it does say,\n\n338\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.350\nlook, it's not that you can't do it,\nright?\n\n339\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.560\nIt's that it's been refused.\n\n340\n00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.020\nSo I know that it's possible, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.190\nThat we can actually do something\nlike this, but it's not working.\n\n342\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.570\nSo let's see,\nif I'm trying to Telnet on port 80,\n\n343\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.060\nwhat if it's like the rest\nof the world today, right?\n\n344\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.520\nPort 80 on web pages.\n\n345\n00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Yep, usually.\n\n346\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n347\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.520\ntoday everybody's turning to port 443\nto secure their connections anymore.\n\n348\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.730\nBut, what if it's actually port\n443 that lets me to connect in?\n\n349\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.012\nSo let's try that.\n\n350\n00:20:24.012 --> 00:20:28.068\nTelnet 198.168.16.3, and\n\n351\n00:20:28.068 --> 00:20:34.218\nthen we're gonna just tell it,\nhey just try it on port 443.\n\n352\n00:20:34.218 --> 00:20:35.685\nAnd let's see what happens there.\n\n353\n00:20:35.685 --> 00:20:39.248\nAw man, I have lost, I'm two for two.\n\n354\n00:20:39.248 --> 00:20:41.058\n&gt;&gt; A swing and a miss.\n&gt;&gt; I hear being a loser.\n\n355\n00:20:41.058 --> 00:20:42.020\n&gt;&gt; Two Ronnies.\n\n356\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.650\n&gt;&gt; Way on the outside here at this point.\n\n357\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.820\nSo now I know something.\n\n358\n00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.010\nMy side seems to be saying\neverything is okay.\n\n359\n00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.970\nIt says I can connect to it but\nsomething is refusing it, okay.\n\n360\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.452\nSo let's go and check out NYWAN1.\n\n361\n00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:06.700\nWhen I check out NYWAN1, I'm looking for\ncertain pieces of information.\n\n362\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.520\nOne is the kind of key result\nthat we're looking for.\n\n363\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.447\nIs this particular router\nsupporting that we've turned on\n\n364\n00:21:15.447 --> 00:21:19.794\nthe HTTP server, okay, or\neven HTTPS server here.\n\n365\n00:21:19.794 --> 00:21:25.190\nSo let me do an enable, I guess I have\nto hit enter a couple of times first.\n\n366\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:31.760\nAnd then enable, and\nnow I can do a show running-config.\n\n367\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.458\nThis time I'm gonna pipe it out,\nwe're gonna include HTTP.\n\n368\n00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:42.460\nI'm gonna press, oops, I have to\nspell include, right, how's that?\n\n369\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.700\nJimminy, my typing ability.\n\n370\n00:21:47.202 --> 00:21:51.660\nShow running-config, pipe that so\nI can filter out most everything else.\n\n371\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.329\nLet me see if I can spell\nit correctly this time.\n\n372\n00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:59.970\nAll right, so Daniel,\nI'm getting the result right now, okay?\n\n373\n00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.462\nSo they wanted to actually have the,\n\n374\n00:22:02.462 --> 00:22:06.530\nto see if HTTP was actually there so\nthey could do this.\n\n375\n00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.870\nThe junior administrator says he\njust wants to make this happen.\n\n376\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.620\nIt's not gonna happen because,\naccording to this, no HTTP server, and\n\n377\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.530\nno HTTP secure server.\n\n378\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.658\nThe difference between this is the top\none's port 80, the second one is port 443.\n\n379\n00:22:19.658 --> 00:22:21.294\n&gt;&gt; 443.\n\n380\n00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:26.096\n&gt;&gt; So this leads me to that conclusion\nat this point, if we were to divide and\n\n381\n00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.640\nconquer.\n\n382\n00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.480\nSo we started off by just\nverifying connectivities,\n\n383\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.160\nlayer three, and\nI was able to get some reply, okay?\n\n384\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.090\nNow, the reply wasn't just basic\nconnectivity, which I did get.\n\n385\n00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.226\nBut it's when I used the application\nlayer, I started to move up,\n\n386\n00:22:42.226 --> 00:22:44.290\ncuz I did get basic connectivity.\n\n387\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.380\nThen I moved up to the application layer,\nand\n\n388\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.020\nit didn't tell me that it wasn't there.\n\n389\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.915\nIt just says it was refused, so at this\npoint, something else is happening, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:56.135\nSo what do I need to do if I want\nsomething like this to actually work\n\n391\n00:22:56.135 --> 00:22:58.035\nthe way I want it to, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:58.035 --> 00:23:03.305\nNow we want to, inside of NYWAN1 here,\n\n393\n00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:06.355\nis let's configure one of these and\nverify that it now works.\n\n394\n00:23:06.355 --> 00:23:10.751\nSo I'm gonna go into my global\nconfiguration terminal.\n\n395\n00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:14.787\nGlobal configuration by\ndoing config terminal.\n\n396\n00:23:14.787 --> 00:23:20.867\nAnd once I'm here, I can type in IP http.\n\n397\n00:23:20.867 --> 00:23:25.845\nNow if you're doing this for\na real router on your network,\n\n398\n00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:32.629\nyou also wanna make sure that instead of\ndoing http, to do http secure-server.\n\n399\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.420\nNow this is kind of the neat thing here,\nis that unlike what we did when we\n\n400\n00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.160\ncreated the ability to do remote\naccess and issue out a key.\n\n401\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.430\nDoing it with HTTP secure server\ngoes through the same process here.\n\n402\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.630\nWhere it goes out and\ngenerates your RSA keys for\n\n403\n00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:55.479\nyou with a standard 1,024 bit key that's\nnot gonna be exportable for you, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:58.520\nNow let's also show you\nsomething else too.\n\n405\n00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.425\nNotice the second sys log\nline that we have here, okay?\n\n406\n00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:06.369\nEven though it's currently enabled,\n\n407\n00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:11.095\nit says PKI which is Public Key\nInfrastructure level is four and\n\n408\n00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:14.890\nhere's the name of it\nwhich is no autosave.\n\n409\n00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.750\nConfiguration has been modified, issue\nright memory to save the new certificate.\n\n410\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.934\nBy default, a router comes with its\nown kind of generic certificate.\n\n411\n00:24:25.934 --> 00:24:29.298\nThe problem is it's usually the same\nidentical certificate that everything else\n\n412\n00:24:29.298 --> 00:24:30.350\nthat they did.\n\n413\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.960\nSo always, if you're going to do this,\nissue yourself a new certificate.\n\n414\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.110\nAnd then, you go ahead and\nissue the right memory.\n\n415\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.116\nI'm going to do the shortcut,\nwhich is do write.\n\n416\n00:24:41.116 --> 00:24:44.400\nNow, I'm here.\n\n417\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.970\nAnd let it go ahead and\nsave that certificate as we actually put\n\n418\n00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.040\nan issue to it to be able to\nuse in the way that we want to.\n\n419\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.245\nSo that's actually gonna\nbe key as we do that too.\n\n420\n00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:57.780\nAll right, now,\nlet's go back and check and\n\n421\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:02.610\nsee if we can make that initial connection\nfrom the other router, which is NYEDGE1.\n\n422\n00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:09.311\nNow, if I do telnet 192.168.16.3.\n\n423\n00:25:09.311 --> 00:25:11.867\nNow that I know that\nsecure server is here,\n\n424\n00:25:11.867 --> 00:25:14.850\nlet's see if we can connect at this point?\n\n425\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.220\nIs what we're actually\nhoping to be able to do.\n\n426\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.730\nLook at that, Daniel.\n\n427\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.010\nIt now says that-\n&gt;&gt; Open.\n\n428\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.090\n&gt;&gt; And it's open, which leads us\nto actually go ahead and go on.\n\n429\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:30.110\nNow that we know that it's open, that\nconnection should be up and ready to go.\n\n430\n00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.906\nSo this is where you would call that\njunior administrator and ask him.\n\n431\n00:25:33.906 --> 00:25:38.070\nTry and do this from your web browser and\nmake sure that everything is actually\n\n432\n00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.390\ngood, the way that you want it to be,\nand that you can still connect to it.\n\n433\n00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Always verify, right?\n\n434\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.950\n&gt;&gt; Always verify and\nthat's always the key at the very end.\n\n435\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:53.660\nSo if we were that junior administrator\nat this point, now we launch the browser.\n\n436\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:06.522\nAnd this time, I'm going to do HTTPS\nbecause I did actually specify that for\n\n437\n00:26:06.522 --> 00:26:11.679\nthe router, 192168 16.3, press Enter.\n\n438\n00:26:13.158 --> 00:26:20.410\nNo, Daniel, it says, there's a problem\nwith this website's security certificate.\n\n439\n00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:20.944\n&gt;&gt; Who cares?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n440\n00:26:20.944 --> 00:26:21.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who cares?\n\n441\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.940\nYou're gonna see these, okay?\n\n442\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.510\nThat's a natural response, at this point.\n\n443\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.960\n&gt;&gt; And this is because this is\na self signed certificate, right?\n\n444\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.460\n&gt;&gt; That's it,\nbecause it's a self signed certificate.\n\n445\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.660\nSo this means that we\ngenerated on the router and\n\n446\n00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.830\nthe router is acting as its own authority.\n\n447\n00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.270\nNobody else can verify that except for\nthe router and\n\n448\n00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.850\nthat's pretty much what it says.\n\n449\n00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.870\nNow I have an option right do I want\nto continue this or close the webpage?\n\n450\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.380\nI'm going to select continue\nto this website and\n\n451\n00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.250\nthere we go Daniel, it is now ready\nto accept credentials once again.\n\n452\n00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.440\nMeaning that we can now connect in and\n\n453\n00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.860\nbe able to do what we want to,\nif we had everything set up.\n\n454\n00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.250\nNow at this point, right?\n\n455\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.520\nYou're able to see some\nof those different ways\n\n456\n00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.660\nto run through these trouble\nshooting models, okay?\n\n457\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.520\nThis, by far is one of\nthe most important concepts,\n\n458\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.630\neven though we're not\nspending a ton of time on it.\n\n459\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.690\nThe only way for\nyou to really get good, okay,\n\n460\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.650\nis by troubleshooting your own stuff.\n\n461\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.200\nAnd just trying to work at it\npoint after point after point.\n\n462\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.150\nBut use this model or use these models.\n\n463\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.300\nAnd try an approach that will help you\nreview your OSI model for the exam.\n\n464\n00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.390\nIt will help you to actually kind of\nlimit and isolate what you want to.\n\n465\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:32.340\nTrait, and make sure that you implement\nproper corrective actions, and\n\n466\n00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.390\nthen decide whether or\nnot you solved it or didn't solve it and\n\n467\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.950\nknow where to go from that point.\n\n468\n00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.100\nBut Daniel that's actually for us here,\nwe take a look at the top down,\n\n469\n00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.090\nthe bottom up, as well as divide and\nconquer method.\n\n470\n00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.760\nAnd there we go.\n\n471\n00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.850\nThe only one that didn't really\nwork was that bottom up one.\n\n472\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.240\nWe got to that part where-\n&gt;&gt; Not our fault.\n\n473\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.400\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense, yeah.\n\n474\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.000\nI'm going to have to actually figure\nout what's going on there, but\n\n475\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.080\nyou kind of got the idea.\n\n476\n00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.850\nI explained to you what\nshould be happening instead,\n\n477\n00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.370\nbut, there it is Daniel.\n\n478\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.590\nWe are now done with that, and that means\nwe are ready to move on to another topic.\n\n479\n00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.420\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nWell, Ronnie, we shot some trouble, and\n\n480\n00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.450\nwe shot it good, and\nhopefully it never comes back, but\n\n481\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.770\nif it does It'll be ready for it now.\n\n482\n00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.090\nThank you so much Ronnie for dropping by,\n\n483\n00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.550\nit was a pleasure to have\nyou on the show as always.\n\n484\n00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.360\nAnd it's a pleasure to have you\ngood folks watching as well.\n\n485\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.870\nHopefully you've enjoyed this episode, and\ngot a lot out of it, that's always our\n\n486\n00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.850\ngoal [LAUGH] when we do these things, why\nwe do what we do, so that you can learn.\n\n487\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.220\nThat being said,\nwe are gonna call it a day.\n\n488\n00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.080\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n489\n00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n490\n00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.759\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n491\n00:28:26.759 -->

00:00:08.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.490\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greeting everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.690\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.958\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:22.060\nin today's episode we continue on\nwith more in our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.890\nAnd joining in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.610\nRonnie Wong, to help guide us along.\n\n10\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.450\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.610\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.400\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue to learn more about,\n\n13\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.310\nwell of course, getting ready for\nthe CCENT exam, as well as preparing\n\n14\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.970\nourselves for entry level task inside\nof networks as we get started.\n\n15\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.100\nSo Daniel, we've talked a lot about\ndifferent networking fundamentals.\n\n16\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.430\nWe've covered so many different topics,\nand you might actually say,\n\n17\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.350\nhey, what else do we actually need to do?\n\n18\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.833\nWell at some point you probably have\nto call me on a carp and go, Ronnie,\n\n19\n00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.436\nyou've talked about Cisco devices and\nsome of the different things, but\n\n20\n00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.450\nyou haven't actually started one or\ndone anything.\n\n21\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.773\nAnd that's because there is,\nthere's some fundamentals you have to get\n\n22\n00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:07.310\nbehind before you start\none of these things.\n\n23\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.380\nYou can start up anytime you want to,\nbut overall though, for\n\n24\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.040\nyou to understand what's happening you\nhave to have those fundamentals down.\n\n25\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.445\nBut today is all about,\nof course, the idea of, well,\n\n26\n00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:20.947\nworking with the devices themselves\nwhen they come to you and what you do.\n\n27\n00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:25.292\nWe're gonna specifically,\nat least in this part of our show here,\n\n28\n00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:29.791\nwe're gonna be taking a look briefly\nat the physical components, and\n\n29\n00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.940\ntalking of course about switches and\nrouters.\n\n30\n00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.320\nAnd then we'll show you something\nabout the ASA as well, the CISCO ASA.\n\n31\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.130\nJust briefly so\nthat we can understand that those aren't\n\n32\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.780\nnormally the products that we're\ngonna see at the CCENT level, and so\n\n33\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.264\nthat's where we're gonna dive into.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Ronnie,\n\n34\n00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:49.600\nI guess the only other thing left for\nus to do is to start with some equipment.\n\n35\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.070\nLet's look at some of this\nhardware you brought in for us.\n\n36\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.727\nI can't get that word out for\nwhatever reason.\n\n37\n00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:56.538\n&gt;&gt; So let's face this, Danial,\n\n38\n00:01:56.538 --> 00:02:00.810\na lot of times especially in a Cisco shop,\nright, you hate to say this.\n\n39\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.210\nI would love that everybody that's\nactually gonna start off with their CCMA,\n\n40\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.950\nthat they're gonna touch brand new\nequipment from the show, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.130\nStraight out of the box, you still feel\nthat freshness, like that new car smell.\n\n42\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.660\nI'd probably be lying to you, Daniel.\n\n43\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.860\nA lot of times the equipment you're\ngonna actually be working with and\n\n44\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.970\nusing is probably gonna be relatively,\nI don't want to say old, but older.\n\n45\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.470\nIt's gonna be used.\n&gt;&gt; We'll call it aged.\n\n46\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.299\n&gt;&gt; Pre-loved, pre-loved in the same way\n\n47\n00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.170\nthat used cars are pre-loved.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n48\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.920\n&gt;&gt; And so that's what\n\n49\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.260\nyou're gonna end up seeing.\n\n50\n00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.850\nWhat we wanna take a look\nat that as well and\n\n51\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.030\nwe're gonna start off with taking\na look at the switches, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.890\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of the switches, okay,\n\n53\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.220\nwe're gonna get into, of course, switching\ncomponents soon inside of our series here.\n\n54\n00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.220\nBut we wanted to talk about handling\nthe hardware as it comes in.\n\n55\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.995\nSo when you do end up getting\na Cisco switch, let me go ahead and\n\n56\n00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:54.112\njust hold this one up for a moment.\n\n57\n00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:55.680\nLet me see if I can hold\nit toward the camera.\n\n58\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Probably a good idea.\n\n59\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.690\n&gt;&gt; The front end,\n\n60\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.882\nit looks like a pizza box, and\n\n61\n00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:02.450\nthen it has a bunch of ports on the front\nis what you'll end up seeing, of course.\n\n62\n00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.160\nAnd it's relatively heavy.\n\n63\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.617\nI'm not going to say it's as light as\n\n64\n00:03:05.617 --> 00:03:06.420\na pizza.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.290\n&gt;&gt; But it's relatively heavy because there\n\n66\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.250\nis some hardware inside that we\nwanna take a look at as well.\n\n67\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.920\nBut we also need to understand\nthe interfaces that we'll be dealing with,\n\n68\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.150\nnot only on this side of the switch, but\non the other side of the switch as well.\n\n69\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.810\nSo even if you were going to get\none of these out of, let's say that\n\n70\n00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.900\nyou do what I do sometimes which is you\ngo to eBay and go, I need a switch.\n\n71\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.675\nAnd you find a switch which\nyou think suits what you want.\n\n72\n00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:36.360\nNormally you'll get this, the switch\ndevice itself and hopefully a power cable.\n\n73\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.940\nNow if it's used it's not\nalways guaranteed, but\n\n74\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.270\nhopefully you'll get a power\ncable that is for it.\n\n75\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.290\nAnd if the guy is,\nif he's got a whole stack of these around,\n\n76\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.910\nyou might even get an extra bonus and\nget the console cable with it.\n\n77\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.370\nBrand new you'll definitely get these\ncomponents along with the switch too,\n\n78\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.960\nokay, but\nthat's pretty much just about it.\n\n79\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.620\nNow there are other components that\nwill be additional that you may need,\n\n80\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.920\nbut those will be separate purchases,\nof course, as you start to do this.\n\n81\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.193\nSo Daniel, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the outside, and\n\n82\n00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:10.800\nthen we're gonna open the switch up and\nthen take a look at the inside.\n\n83\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.793\nSo that we see what the components\nare on the inside, but\n\n84\n00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:16.700\nwe definitely want to start\non the outside first.\n\n85\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.330\nSo, let me see if I can turn this over,\nand we are gonna switch our camera angle\n\n86\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.920\nhere for a moment too, and\nthat should help us out as well, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.770\nNow the switch before you, as you take\na look at the front interface here.\n\n88\n00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.080\nLet me see if I can kind of maneuver this\nso that we can show it a little bit,\n\n89\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.260\nthe whole thing,\nwithout knocking my audio to extreme here.\n\n90\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.750\nThis particular switch has 48 ports on it.\n\n91\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.010\nSo if I take a look, here's 16 ports here.\n\n92\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.460\nIn this center section there's 16 ports,\n16 ports,\n\n93\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.030\nand that's where we get\nthe idea of those 48 ports.\n\n94\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.930\nAnd then they have\nadditional up link ports\n\n95\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.160\nover here on the right hand side as well,\nokay.\n\n96\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.090\nNow on the front too you'll also get\nthis panel over here on the right.\n\n97\n00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.870\nNow it's a little bit difficult\nto see from our angle, let's\n\n98\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.270\nsee if we can zoom in if at all possible,\nand we'll see what we can do there.\n\n99\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.130\nAll right, well if that's as good as,\nokay, let's see, all right.\n\n100\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.380\nAwesome.\n\n101\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.335\nLet me move that around then\nhold it steady for a moment.\n\n102\n00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:22.840\nNow see if that actually\n\n103\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.130\nallows us to, there you go, look at that.\n&gt;&gt; Looking pretty\n\n104\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.660\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n105\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.250\nthat's actually doing pretty good.\n\n106\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.460\nSo those lights, of course,\n\n107\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.020\nare indicators of the operation of\nthe switch when you first power them up.\n\n108\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.240\nAnd then you can use this mode button\nto change some of the different\n\n109\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.320\nthings that you see here\nsuch as duplex speed.\n\n110\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.770\nThe last one there is POE,\n\n111\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.150\nwhich means power over ethernet,\nallowing us to supply power\n\n112\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.960\nto devices even through the port that\nwe're also doing networking on as well.\n\n113\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.220\nWe also have the system,\nwhich of course is usually on.\n\n114\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.560\nRPS stands for remote power supply or\n\n115\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.320\nredundant power supply,\nyou'll see that as well.\n\n116\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.160\nAnd then stats, duplex.\n\n117\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.770\nSo these buttons over here,\nthey'll actually light up in what we have.\n\n118\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.580\nNow it's very difficult to see because we\ndon't actually have any power going to\n\n119\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.220\nthe switch, but right above each one\nof these is actually going to be\n\n120\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.030\na little light that will actually\nlight up when something is plugged in.\n\n121\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.500\nSo the way that this works in terms of the\nnumbering on the switch and on your ports,\n\n122\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.900\nright, is that on\nthe upper left hand corner,\n\n123\n00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.010\nthat's always gonna be port number one.\n\n124\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.252\nAnd then directly underneath it two,\nthree, four, five,\n\n125\n00:06:30.252 --> 00:06:32.900\nsix, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\n126\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.495\nAnd when you take a look at the lights,\n\n127\n00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:38.610\nyou'll actually see that they're kind of\npointed in different directions as well.\n\n128\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.818\nSo where you see this pattern, Daniel, as\nyou take a look at the shape of the ports,\n\n129\n00:06:44.818 --> 00:06:48.690\nokay, you actually see that\nthe lights are also in that shape.\n\n130\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.690\nThat way if they're lit and\nyou actually see that you go, yeah,\n\n131\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.860\nI'm plugged into that upper port.\n\n132\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.860\nOr if you actually see the other one\nthat is actually turned down just like\n\n133\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.850\nthis one is, you'll actually go,\nokay, I'm plugged into that one.\n\n134\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.020\nBut if something is plugged\ninto it that's also,\n\n135\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.440\nof course, networking to another device,\nthe light will also be on there.\n\n136\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.903\nIf nothing is plugged into it,\nit should generally be off at that point.\n\n137\n00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:12.732\nOr if you, what we call\nadministratively turned off the port,\n\n138\n00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.860\nyou should also see that.\n\n139\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.200\nSo that will actually allow us to\nbe able to kind of understand that.\n\n140\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.210\nWe'll get to this little yellow\nring around this in a moment.\n\n141\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.010\nLet's scroll over here for\njust a moment, and I say scroll,\n\n142\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.125\nI'm moving the actual switch here.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's got a mouse in his other hand.\n\n143\n00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:32.427\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so this is where you, of course,\n\n144\n00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:34.550\nfind the model of the switch.\n\n145\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.670\nSo If you're working with older equipment,\n\n146\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.770\na lot of times this will\nbe almost wiped out.\n\n147\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.220\nIt's hard, I mean it really is.\n\n148\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.153\nSo sometimes you'll actually see where\nit's nice and pristine and clean.\n\n149\n00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:50.160\nSo this is a catalyst 3650 or 3560.\n\n150\n00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.633\nI keep wanting to say it's a 3650,\nbut I'm always wrong.\n\n151\n00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:59.132\nThis is a 3560, and this switch actually\nperforms both layer 2 and layer 3.\n\n152\n00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:00.519\nNow you're going, Ronnie,\nhow do you know that?\n\n153\n00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.722\nYou just learn it after actually\nusing the switches here.\n\n154\n00:08:03.722 --> 00:08:07.142\nAnd there's only certain series that will\nactually only do layer two switching.\n\n155\n00:08:07.142 --> 00:08:10.943\nAnd there's other ones, what we call\nmulti-layer switches like this one,\n\n156\n00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:13.637\nthat will also perform routing and\nswitching as well.\n\n157\n00:08:13.637 --> 00:08:18.613\nThe other thing that this one has\nis PoE and it actually has a -48,\n\n158\n00:08:18.613 --> 00:08:24.880\ntelling you that all of the actual ports\ncan supply that power over ethernet.\n\n159\n00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.850\nSo it allows you to actually\nplug these things in.\n\n160\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.850\nAnd provide additional power to those\ndevices that are plugged in to make\n\n161\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.520\nsure that they can be powered through\nhere without needing an extra wall warp.\n\n162\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.680\nSo, for example, VOIP phones and stuff\nlike that, they normally can get their\n\n163\n00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.805\npower supply through here if\neverything else is going on, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:47.090\nNow, like I said, I wanna come back to\nthis yellow thing, cuz it's interesting.\n\n165\n00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.930\nBut let's flip this thing over, okay.\n\n166\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.650\nOn the side you see vents, so you'll\nsee the same thing on the other side.\n\n167\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.110\nI removed most of these screws here,\nbecause we're \\about to remove the top.\n\n168\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.610\nI don't wanna spend time removing\nlike 14 screws that were around here.\n\n169\n00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.890\nBut let's take a look at the back on\nwhat this switch will look like, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.740\nDaniel, I'm gonna need your help here for\na moment.\n\n171\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.410\nTake that cable for right now, and\n\n172\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.240\nthere's really only one port on\nthis particular cable right here,\n\n173\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.107\nwhich is the console port.\n&gt;&gt; Right here.\n\n174\n00:09:17.107 --> 00:09:17.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n175\n00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:19.293\nright there that's the one that fits them.\n\n176\n00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:21.291\nSo Daniel, I know it's kind\nof a little bit awkward for\n\n177\n00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:22.155\nyou there.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n178\n00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:22.863\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay.\n\n179\n00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:28.360\nSo now, that's pretty much the only thing\nthat fits back here on this one, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.292\nMost of the switches that\nyou'll end up seeing,\n\n181\n00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:33.970\nat least the older ones\nthat are actually meant for\n\n182\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:40.360\nyou to be using them individually and not\nactually connecting them together as one.\n\n183\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.500\nYou're gonna see that that's probably\nthe only port that you have in the back.\n\n184\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.810\nThis allows you to directly\ncable into the device.\n\n185\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.230\nAnd, on the other end of\nmine is an older one,\n\n186\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.210\nwhich, of course, is this RS232 connector.\n\n187\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.120\nThat means on the laptop that I bring\nin it either has to have that serial\n\n188\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.560\nport connector or\nI need a USB adapter to connect in.\n\n189\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.690\nThese newer ones today will\nhave the micro or the mini.\n\n190\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.970\nI always get confused\nwhich one it actually is.\n\n191\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.924\nSo they'll have the USB\nthat's the smaller USB.\n\n192\n00:10:07.924 --> 00:10:09.520\nSome of them may be standard size.\n\n193\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.580\nBut most of them are the smaller ones\nthat you might also see here, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.332\nSo this allows you to\nconfigure the switch.\n\n195\n00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:18.490\nSo that's what we normally connect into.\n\n196\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.837\nAt the very beginning,\nwhen we begin our configuration,\n\n197\n00:10:21.837 --> 00:10:24.924\nwe'll be using a cable like\nthis to console right in.\n\n198\n00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:27.962\nSo we're not dependent on there\nbeing network connectivity,\n\n199\n00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:30.320\nwe're not dependent on anything else.\n\n200\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.140\nOnce I plug in here, it's gonna start\nsending signal through the end over here.\n\n201\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.190\nAnd it will display on my laptop or\nmy desktop, whatever it is, and\n\n202\n00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.500\nallow me to actually see the way that\nthe command prompt is gonna run and\n\n203\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.700\ncome up here, too, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.049\nThere, of course,\nis the regular power supply built in here.\n\n205\n00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:54.842\nNow you do wanna pay attention to the\nrating of this as well as the amperages\n\n206\n00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:57.200\nthat you see here, too.\n\n207\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.430\nThe reason why, especially, is,\nif this particular switch supports PoE,\n\n208\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.040\npower over ethernet, that means you can't\njust find a standard power supply that you\n\n209\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.200\nthink fits in the slot that will work.\n\n210\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.470\nYou have to make sure that you supply\npower, not only for the switching\n\n211\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.940\nconnections to work, but also to do\nthe power over ethernet connection.\n\n212\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.180\nEvery port, and\nlet's say it supplies 15 volts of power.\n\n213\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.060\nWe add up all the ports on the front side.\n\n214\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.100\nYou need to make sure that that\npower supply can support it.\n\n215\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.420\nSo here you see the idea of 100 to 240,\nand\n\n216\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.097\nthen 5 to 2.5 amps at 50 to 60 Hz.\n\n217\n00:11:33.097 --> 00:11:36.180\nMake sure you get the same rating of one,\ntoo.\n\n218\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.188\nAnd then there's one other port, for\nthe idea of the remote power supply.\n\n219\n00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:43.702\nSo I said it was like\nthe redundant power supply, but\n\n220\n00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.590\nyou can also see the term remote.\n\n221\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.770\nThis is where you have an external\nsupply power that plugs in\n\n222\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.770\njust in case this one goes out.\n\n223\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.480\nAnd it's a good idea, especially\nin a high critical environment, or\n\n224\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.720\na mission critical environment,\n\n225\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.810\nI should say, that you might also\nadd this in there, as well, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.980\nThey didn't put it inside,\nbecause they said, look,\n\n227\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.010\nit's an additional feature\nthat some people will use.\n\n228\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.383\nBut if you don't need it,\nyou don't need it.\n\n229\n00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:10.430\nSo they didn't wanna add extra cost in\nthere for somebody that just says, no,\n\n230\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.260\nI just need it for the basic switching and\n\n231\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.620\nthe basic routing functionality that\nwe want to be able to put here, okay.\n\n232\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.540\nSo that's kind of the only physical\nthings on the outside of this,\n\n233\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.800\nthat we actually are taking a look at,\nexcept for that yellow box.\n\n234\n00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.730\nAnd I keep teasing at this here.\n\n235\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:33.510\nSo Daniel, we've gotta talk about the\ncolor scheme that we're seeing as well.\n\n236\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.830\nNow, on Cisco switches, and you should\nfind this regardless of the model.\n\n237\n00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.880\nSo this is a relatively older one,\nbut this is kind of the standard one,\n\n238\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.242\nthe one that I've used on just about every\nother Cisco show that I've ever been on.\n\n239\n00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:48.610\nCuz it's so stable,\n\n240\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.440\nit's just a rock-solid model of a layer\nthree switch that I need, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.350\nNow, when you start seeing\nthis yellow box here, okay-\n\n242\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.170\n&gt;&gt; That border?\n\n243\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the border that you see.\n\n244\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.850\nNotice that some of them have a yellow\nborder around the individual port\n\n245\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.870\nhere, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.032\nNow this is different, you can even see on\nthe physical plug ins that you see here.\n\n247\n00:13:09.032 --> 00:13:12.791\nOn this one right here, Daniel, this is\ndesigned for, I'm gonna get this wrong,\n\n248\n00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.041\nI think, but I hope not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:18.076\n&gt;&gt; It's an SFP port-\n\n250\n00:13:18.076 --> 00:13:19.137\n&gt;&gt; What's that, small-\n\n251\n00:13:19.137 --> 00:13:19.803\n&gt;&gt; Small form\n\n252\n00:13:19.803 --> 00:13:20.617\npluggable.\n\n253\n00:13:20.617 --> 00:13:21.212\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:23.445\nI always say SPF,\nwhich is the sunscreen protection number.\n\n255\n00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:25.518\n&gt;&gt; That's 90 to 70, sun's the devil.\n\n256\n00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:27.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n257\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.000\nthis allows us to be able to plug\na fiber optic cable into this.\n\n258\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000\nAnd, Daniel, you can actually even see\ndown at the bottom, very briefly there,\n\n259\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.760\nthat mirrored surface that you're seeing.\n\n260\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.530\nThat's the pinpoint, that's the laser\nbeam that's actually in there.\n\n261\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.310\nSo there's also a laser power\nsupply in here that provides this.\n\n262\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.413\nAnd, on this corner,\nwhen it comes from Cisco,\n\n263\n00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:53.860\nyou'll actually see it says\nit's a class one laser product.\n\n264\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.740\nSo they're telling you don't\nlook directly into this thing.\n\n265\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.850\nThey're giving you this warning sticker.\n\n266\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.860\nBut now, Daniel, as I go on through here,\n\n267\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.360\nall of the sudden I may even brand new\ncome across something, and I see this.\n\n268\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.880\nMy gosh, Daniel,\nthis thing says it's 10 years old.\n\n269\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.510\n&gt;&gt; 10 years old.\n\n270\n00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.913\n&gt;&gt; Now, it could be 10 years old, or\n\n271\n00:14:11.913 --> 00:14:15.210\nit could actually almost\nbe brand spanking new.\n\n272\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.860\nIn other words, if I purchase\na brand new one at this point,\n\n273\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:26.440\nit doesn't mean that everything you buy\nis actually this old, some of them are.\n\n274\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.110\nBut, it's like the components don't\nreally wear out in that sense, right?\n\n275\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.650\nSo they might have actually had\nthose components inside when they\n\n276\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.970\nmanufactured it.\n\n277\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.782\nAnd they might have actually manufactured\nit, let's say, I'm gonna lie to you,\n\n278\n00:14:37.782 --> 00:14:41.310\nlet's say, 4 years ago, instead,\nor 5 years ago from now.\n\n279\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.563\nBut the manufacturer components, though,\n\n280\n00:14:43.563 --> 00:14:46.200\nmay have actually come\npreviously than that.\n\n281\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.770\nThat's because they haven't\nactually done a lot to\n\n282\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.030\nimprove on this hardware model itself.\n\n283\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.880\nSo even though you might have a switch\nthat they're still producing,\n\n284\n00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.550\nat some point, let's say, 2 years,\n3 years after it initially came out,\n\n285\n00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.310\nyou're still gonna see, even if you buy\none today, and looks brand spanking new.\n\n286\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.820\nYou'll still see it was\nmanufactured awhile ago.\n\n287\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.070\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just\n\n288\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.110\nmaking sure I'm following you.\n\n289\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.330\nThat manufacture date is not the date\nthat this thing was assembled.\n\n290\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah it's kind of weird.\n\n291\n00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.911\nBut there's components inside,\nso they're letting you know-\n\n292\n00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:15.080\n&gt;&gt; That's strange.\n\n293\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.050\n&gt;&gt; They're letting you know\n\n294\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.400\nthat it's not the idea of when\nit was actually put together.\n\n295\n00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.800\nSome of these components\nare older inside than that.\n\n296\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.735\nBut it may be that it was never turned on.\n\n297\n00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.900\nAnd everything else is\nactually still functional.\n\n298\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.752\nBut they have to actually show you\nthat this is what's happening here.\n\n299\n00:15:31.752 --> 00:15:35.300\nSo, here on the fiber optic lasers,\nthis one hasn't been that way.\n\n300\n00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.090\nI've even seen some when I pulled them out\nto actually spray, every once in a while,\n\n301\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.320\nyou have to, if you get in those\nenvironments where there's high dust.\n\n302\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.920\nAnd you can always tell,\ncuz on the ports, there's a cake of that-\n\n303\n00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n304\n00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:47.590\n&gt;&gt; Dust bunny, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n305\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.267\nAnd you go, all right, it's time for\nus to kind of start to,\n\n306\n00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:55.182\nlet's turn on another switch and\nplug those things in quickly.\n\n307\n00:15:55.182 --> 00:16:00.421\nAnd then spray those things out,\nand I've seen that working also\n\n308\n00:16:00.421 --> 00:16:05.862\ndoing some Cisco training with\nthe special forces group, as well.\n\n309\n00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:08.415\nWhen they bring their switches back,\nthere's so\n\n310\n00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:12.061\nmuch dust in them that they literally\nhave to open up every component and\n\n311\n00:16:12.061 --> 00:16:14.680\nthey have to use compressed air and\nspray it out.\n\n312\n00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.960\nThese things can work in high, very high\nheat environments, very arid temperatures.\n\n313\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.630\nI don't think wet temperatures so much.\n\n314\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.880\nOr wet environments, hot, humid, yeah.\n\n315\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.040\nBut you know,\nthe idea that they can go from that.\n\n316\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.310\nAnd I said no, these things are caked\nwith like dust and sand inside of them.\n\n317\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.530\nAnd they just operate\nlike there's no tomorrow.\n\n318\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.150\nAnd they're still running and\nworking and doing that.\n\n319\n00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.690\nSo, these things will work forever.\n\n320\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.120\nAnd even if you don't take care of them,\n\n321\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.155\nthey tend to work forever as long\nas everything is actually okay.\n\n322\n00:16:44.155 --> 00:16:44.826\nOkay.\n\n323\n00:16:44.826 --> 00:16:45.997\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:16:45.997 --> 00:16:49.250\nSo now, I've teased it again now for\na third time.\n\n325\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.070\nI always get lost or something.\n\n326\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.451\nSo let's go back to these yellow things.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n327\n00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:55.000\n&gt;&gt; I know, I can't help it.\n\n328\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.350\nThat's what happens as I start\ntalking about this stuff.\n\n329\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.120\nSo, what is this about?\n\n330\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.940\nWell, when it comes down to gig ports,\nokay, that you may have\n\n331\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.590\nIt actually allows you and\nit's actually a marker for gigabit ports.\n\n332\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.990\nThat's what it's a marker for.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n333\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.670\nbasically yellow boarder is gigabit port.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n334\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.970\nNow, when we do that,\n\n335\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.590\nit's actually saying that each one of\nthese ports has a gigabit connection.\n\n336\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:18.740\nMake sense?\n\n337\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.690\nSo Daniel, what do you think it\nmeans when we surround 16 ports\n\n338\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.580\nwith a yellow boarder?\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that\n\n339\n00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.700\nthey are all Gigabit ports.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n340\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.450\nthen we might not be right, okay.\n\n341\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.297\nSo that's what I want to point out-\n&gt;&gt; That's fine [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:17:33.297 --> 00:17:34.337\n&gt;&gt; No but I want to point it out because I\n\n343\n00:17:34.337 --> 00:17:36.073\nthink you're right-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n344\n00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:36.892\n&gt;&gt; If I told you that,\n\n345\n00:17:36.892 --> 00:17:39.017\nyellow means that they're Gigabit ports.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n346\n00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.748\n&gt;&gt; Well that makes sense here, right?\n\n347\n00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:44.434\nEach one of these being yellow,\neach one of these has a gigabit port.\n\n348\n00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:47.440\nAnd you would be 100% right, okay?\n\n349\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.780\nSo but now when you have 16 here,\n\n350\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.480\nthis has to do what how that\nbandwidth is divided now, okay?\n\n351\n00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.681\nSo what they're shown you here is, and\n\n352\n00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:00.895\nou hear the term oversubscription\na lot of times, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:03.995\nAnd what that means is on these 16 ports,\nthey're\n\n354\n00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:06.715\n100 megabit each on this one, I believe.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n355\n00:18:06.715 --> 00:18:07.877\nthink this one's 100 megabit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:07.877 --> 00:18:09.827\nThese are 100 meg.\nI was trying to remember whether they were\n\n357\n00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:11.520\nfast ethernet ports or not, but they are.\n\n358\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.734\nThey're fast ethernet ports, and that\nmeans that they all share a gig backplane.\n\n359\n00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:20.928\nSo it doesn't necessarily mean that\nthey won't get their 100, okay?\n\n360\n00:18:20.928 --> 00:18:24.922\nBut it means that if two or three\nare actually using it at the same time,\n\n361\n00:18:24.922 --> 00:18:27.104\nthey'll divide that gigabyte plan.\n\n362\n00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:30.090\nSo they'll divide that up and\nthey'll still be okay.\n\n363\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.920\nIf ten of them go on, it still works.\n&gt;&gt; Still good to go.\n\n364\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Still good to go.\n\n365\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.200\nBut now when you hit 16 though.\n\n366\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.710\nThere has to be that balance and that's\nwhen they'll start shutting it down.\n\n367\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.940\nSo, it's not that it won't work, you'll\nstill get your full 100 megabit, okay?\n\n368\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.700\nBut once you get to a certain level then,\nthen you know that that yellow that\n\n369\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.090\nsurrounds multiple ports here, that means\nthey're sharing that particular bonding.\n\n370\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.628\nSo, usually the multiples are one.\n\n371\n00:18:57.628 --> 00:19:00.650\nSometimes you'll have two,\nand then four, and eight.\n\n372\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.082\nIt sounds like binary, 16.\n\n373\n00:19:04.082 --> 00:19:06.936\nSo that's what you're actually\nseeing here is the same thing.\n\n374\n00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:10.616\nSo ideally, what you would do,\nif you could actually afford it.\n\n375\n00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:13.663\nAnd if your company actually\nhas this is if you go, and\n\n376\n00:19:13.663 --> 00:19:16.728\nyou see the front of a Cisco switch,\nlike a 37 50.\n\n377\n00:19:16.728 --> 00:19:20.166\nAnd each one of these ports\nhas a little yellow border,\n\n378\n00:19:20.166 --> 00:19:24.521\nyou know that every single one\nessentially has a dedicated gig port.\n\n379\n00:19:24.521 --> 00:19:28.061\nAnd that means that it can reach full\ngig speeds all the way through every\n\n380\n00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:28.773\nsingle port.\n\n381\n00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:32.361\nPort okay, this one no but\nit does divide it up for you so\n\n382\n00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:37.514\nsometimes you'll have that, or\nthat's what's called over subscription.\n\n383\n00:19:37.514 --> 00:19:39.582\nYou take a gig and\nyou divide it up among these ports,\n\n384\n00:19:39.582 --> 00:19:42.216\nthat's how they come up with their\nbandwidth to be able to do that.\n\n385\n00:19:42.216 --> 00:19:45.672\nSo, as long as you really\ndon't go over like let's say,\n\n386\n00:19:45.672 --> 00:19:48.348\nten ports at this point and\nin theory maybe.\n\n387\n00:19:48.348 --> 00:19:51.152\nIt depends on how you measure things out.\n\n388\n00:19:51.152 --> 00:19:52.993\nSending and receiving,\nyou've got to count that too.\n\n389\n00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:57.358\nThey're sending at 100 megabits and\nthey're receiving at 100 megabits,\n\n390\n00:19:57.358 --> 00:19:59.710\nthat could be 200 megabits altogether.\n\n391\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.751\nSo it could be fiveor it could be ten,\n\n392\n00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:04.730\nmost of us don't actually send\nat those speeds, anyways.\n\n393\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.120\nBut you start doing that.\n\n394\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.144\nYou can actually see where.\n\n395\n00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:09.774\nLook, most of the time you're\nnot gonna plug in all 40.\n\n396\n00:20:09.774 --> 00:20:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.693\n&gt;&gt; Have I done that with this switch?\n\n398\n00:20:11.693 --> 00:20:12.400\nYes.\n\n399\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.286\nYes, I've used this and every single\nport has been filled except for\n\n400\n00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:16.247\nthese guys over here.\n\n401\n00:20:16.247 --> 00:20:19.127\nBut yes, that means they're dividing\nit up, but overall though, okay?\n\n402\n00:20:19.127 --> 00:20:23.410\nSo make sure you can identify something\nlike that on these switches too, okay?\n\n403\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.040\nNow a very important part of the concept,\n\n404\n00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.900\nsome of the things that\nwe're looking at there.\n\n405\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.778\nBut once you do that and you plug this\nthing in, once you plug it in, then it\n\n406\n00:20:31.778 --> 00:20:35.909\nstarts going through some of the same\nthings that we have to which is of course,\n\n407\n00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:37.310\npower up and everything.\n\n408\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.238\nAnd we're actually take sometime and we'll\ntalk about before we get into the device\n\n409\n00:20:41.238 --> 00:20:43.410\nconfiguration once we turned it on,\nbe sure.\n\n410\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.923\nYeah, it boots up.\nWe'll go in through the boot process and\n\n411\n00:20:45.923 --> 00:20:47.163\ntalk about that, too.\n\n412\n00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:51.007\nBut for today, we're just really\nspending time in the hardware itself,\n\n413\n00:20:51.007 --> 00:20:54.233\nmaking sure that we can identify\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n414\n00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:57.400\nSo once everything is done here, okay?\n\n415\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.210\nLast thing that you want\nto make sure of right,\n\n416\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.850\nis let's take a look at\nthe internal components, briefly.\n\n417\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.980\nSo I just taken out I think there\nare like six screws on each side and\n\n418\n00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.672\nnot eight on the back.\n\n419\n00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:13.261\nAnd you see them,\nthey're kind of unusual like, sorry.\n\n420\n00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:14.500\n&gt;&gt; Put in the shot.\n\n421\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah put it in the shot, Ronnie.\n\n422\n00:21:16.657 --> 00:21:17.411\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:21.569\nSo notice like right here there's one\ntwo and then it kind of skips a space,\n\n424\n00:21:21.569 --> 00:21:23.890\nthree and then it skipped another space.\n\n425\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.874\nI'm trying not to knock the microphone or-\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be\n\n426\n00:21:26.874 --> 00:21:27.743\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n427\n00:21:27.743 --> 00:21:28.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n428\n00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.418\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's pretty much here.\n\n429\n00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:31.354\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:21:31.354 --> 00:21:32.740\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just gonna remove\n\n431\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.160\nthe one screw that I actually put in here,\nactually two.\n\n432\n00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.624\nThere's one on each side.\n\n433\n00:21:37.624 --> 00:21:39.378\nSee if I don't drop\nthe switch that's the key.\n\n434\n00:21:39.378 --> 00:21:41.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:21:41.418 --> 00:21:43.849\n&gt;&gt; I think we're all kind\nof hoping that we see that.\n\n436\n00:21:43.849 --> 00:21:45.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n437\n00:21:45.248 --> 00:21:47.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, except that it would be a large\n\n438\n00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:50.248\ncrash and Aubrey's ears would\nbleed cuz she's got headphones on.\n\n439\n00:21:53.317 --> 00:21:56.295\nSo these screws are not\nreally long at all.\n\n440\n00:21:56.295 --> 00:21:59.451\nThat's all they do,\nthey really just hold them in place.\n\n441\n00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:02.060\nI'm about to lose one too, aren't I?\n\n442\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.666\nSure enough.\n\n443\n00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:05.431\nAll right.\n\n444\n00:22:08.622 --> 00:22:10.327\nIt just banged.\n&gt;&gt; Real life [INAUDIBLE].\n\n445\n00:22:10.327 --> 00:22:12.410\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, there we go.\n\n446\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.327\nI'm just trying to put this up there so\nthat people could see.\n\n447\n00:22:15.327 --> 00:22:18.472\nSo, they're not really long,\nthey're just holding the cover on here.\n\n448\n00:22:18.472 --> 00:22:20.994\nThat's all they're doing.\n\n449\n00:22:20.994 --> 00:22:24.510\nOnce you remove all the screws, there's\na couple of different ways that those\n\n450\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.210\nthings can come up depending\non the devices of.\n\n451\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:32.047\nSome of them you may have to\nslide backwards first, and\n\n452\n00:22:32.047 --> 00:22:34.266\nthen it lifts up, okay.\n\n453\n00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:36.819\nOn this one there are so\nmany screws in place you don't.\n\n454\n00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:39.693\nAnd once you remove the screws,\nyou just have to pull back a little bit.\n\n455\n00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:42.755\nSome of them have little ears that tuck\nright behind the facial plate here.\n\n456\n00:22:42.755 --> 00:22:46.868\nBut this one, you just kind of pull off,\nand there you go.\n\n457\n00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:50.517\n&gt;&gt; Here's where the magic happens.\n\n458\n00:22:50.517 --> 00:22:51.782\n&gt;&gt; So internally here,\n\n459\n00:22:51.782 --> 00:22:54.803\nyo're not going to be tested\non this part so much But\n\n460\n00:22:54.803 --> 00:22:59.604\nI just wanted to show you something,\nbecause a lot of people don't understand.\n\n461\n00:22:59.604 --> 00:23:03.362\nIt's kind of the same thing\nas a regular computer, okay?\n\n462\n00:23:03.362 --> 00:23:06.812\nThere are some specialized\nthings that you see.\n\n463\n00:23:06.812 --> 00:23:09.384\nBut overall, though,\nit's really a regular computer.\n\n464\n00:23:09.384 --> 00:23:11.450\nNotice there's a motherboard, okay?\n\n465\n00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.690\nIt makes sense.\n\n466\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.483\nNow, what's actually very important here,\nof course,\n\n467\n00:23:15.483 --> 00:23:17.137\nis the cooling that happens here.\n\n468\n00:23:17.137 --> 00:23:21.999\nThere's actually only one external\ncooling fan which is right here.\n\n469\n00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:26.063\nBut Daniel, notice there's actually\ntwo cooling fans here, okay?\n\n470\n00:23:26.063 --> 00:23:29.694\nAnd that means, this,\nright here, needs what?\n\n471\n00:23:29.694 --> 00:23:30.351\n&gt;&gt; Some serious cooling.\n\n472\n00:23:30.351 --> 00:23:31.208\n&gt;&gt; Some serious cooling, yeah.\n\n473\n00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:32.390\n&gt;&gt; That's the power supply.\n\n474\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.401\n&gt;&gt; That's the power supply.\n\n475\n00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:36.284\nSo it let's you know that on this one,\nthey said look,\n\n476\n00:23:36.284 --> 00:23:38.297\nthe power supply needs more cooling.\n\n477\n00:23:38.297 --> 00:23:40.312\nAnd this is just a solid block.\n\n478\n00:23:40.312 --> 00:23:43.204\nI mean it is a rock-solid\nblock of stuff back there.\n\n479\n00:23:43.204 --> 00:23:46.861\nBut all this is basically\nthe power supply back there.\n\n480\n00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:51.254\nThe motherboard and of course that means\nthere's a CPU on this board as well.\n\n481\n00:23:51.254 --> 00:23:55.120\nYou have heat sinks to disperse the heat,\nbut\n\n482\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.511\nthe main action which you\ncan barely see is up here.\n\n483\n00:23:59.511 --> 00:24:02.110\nDaniel, this is,\nit's just a roll of plastic.\n\n484\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.843\nThat's what it feels like, okay.\n\n485\n00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:06.586\nBut at the end of this it kind of\nhas a hump over it [CROSSTALK].\n\n486\n00:24:06.586 --> 00:24:08.710\nYeah, it curves.\n\n487\n00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.854\nOn the motherboard itself,\nthere's a bunch of LED lamps.\n\n488\n00:24:12.854 --> 00:24:17.170\nAnd when they start flashing,\nwell that's what provides\n\n489\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.943\nthe flashing to these little\nlights that you see up here, okay?\n\n490\n00:24:21.943 --> 00:24:27.200\nSo that's what provides the flashing\nthat we see right through there.\n\n491\n00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.780\nSo you don't want one\nof these that's broken,\n\n492\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.590\ncuz if they're broken you won't ever know.\n\n493\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.060\nEven if the light is on,\nyou will not know.\n\n494\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.855\nIt's weird how I've seen that.\n\n495\n00:24:34.855 --> 00:24:37.270\nSomebody actually broke one of these.\n\n496\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.130\nThat port doesn't work,\nI was like, watch this.\n\n497\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.930\nI plugged it in, that port works.\n\n498\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.370\nAnd then we saw where that little\npiece of plastic had been broken.\n\n499\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.140\nThat's all it was, it was just broken and\n\n500\n00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.300\nit just made that disconnection to the\nother end of where that light source was.\n\n501\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.210\nSo these things, you don't want to break.\n\n502\n00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.560\nYou want to make sure that\nyou're careful with them.\n\n503\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.250\nThat's why I didn't try and remove one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n504\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.532\n&gt;&gt; Is what I didn't try to do.\n\n505\n00:24:57.532 --> 00:25:00.052\nBut underneath that,\nthere's a whole grid and\n\n506\n00:25:00.052 --> 00:25:03.517\nseries of different little chips\nthat you see and this is where you\n\n507\n00:25:03.517 --> 00:25:06.982\nstart to actually understand\nsomething about each one of those.\n\n508\n00:25:06.982 --> 00:25:10.014\nThose are,\nessentially each one of these ports and\n\n509\n00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:13.056\nthose chips is one network interface card,\nokay?\n\n510\n00:25:13.056 --> 00:25:16.580\nEvery single one of these\nports is essentially a NIC and\n\n511\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:22.280\njust like on your computer, they each\nhave their own individual MAC addresses.\n\n512\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.360\nEverything that a NIC\ndoes is done right here.\n\n513\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.220\nAnd it also, of course, has the advantage\nand the reason why switches are very,\n\n514\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.670\nvery expensive is because it actually\nhas something that we call ASICS, okay.\n\n515\n00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:41.080\nASICS is Application Specific\nIntegrated Circuitry, which means it's\n\n516\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.090\ndedicated software that's been hardwired,\nthat's kinda the easiest way to do this.\n\n517\n00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.012\nSo it allows for every single port,\ninstead of having to send it to the CPU,\n\n518\n00:25:50.012 --> 00:25:53.564\nwhich l'm gonna say is either right\nunder one of these heat things or\n\n519\n00:25:53.564 --> 00:25:56.642\nthis thing right here,\nl'm just guessing at this point.\n\n520\n00:25:56.642 --> 00:26:00.990\nBut instead of having to send it from one\nport and then having to actually interrupt\n\n521\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:05.099\nthe CPU to do stuff, it just says in\nthe ASICS, you're going to this port?\n\n522\n00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:06.124\nLet's not even worry about that.\n\n523\n00:26:06.124 --> 00:26:09.443\nLet's just go ahead and\npush it on to that port as well.\n\n524\n00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:12.849\nAnd that's because of the way that\nthey have this thing configured,\n\n525\n00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:15.090\nis that it works like a grid, right?\n\n526\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.090\nSo that when you actually have the way\nthat they have these configured, and\n\n527\n00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.510\nyou'll see that there's actually 16\nof these chips that you'll see that\n\n528\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.060\nare actually lined up here.\n\n529\n00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.270\nAnd then if you go across in rows like\nthis as well, that grid is actually what\n\n530\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.515\nallows that ASIC to communicate\nwith all the other ports and\n\n531\n00:26:30.515 --> 00:26:34.020\nactually be hardwired together\nin the way that it is.\n\n532\n00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.120\nSo it makes for\nvery fast switching, too, okay.\n\n533\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.570\nSo most of the time when\nwe start to see this,\n\n534\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:43.730\nright, there's not,\nDaniel, I don't remember.\n\n535\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.590\nEvery once in a while when the switch\ngets noisy, I just go ahead and\n\n536\n00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.730\nremove the cover and\nI start blowing out using compressed air.\n\n537\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.960\nThe fans, but\nunless it's caked with a ton of dust or\n\n538\n00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.400\nsand or whatever it is,\nI'm probably just gonna leave it alone.\n\n539\n00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.826\nWe really don't want to disturb\nanything in here if we don't have to.\n\n540\n00:27:05.826 --> 00:27:09.522\nThese things are designed for you to\nturn them on and leave them running, so\n\n541\n00:27:09.522 --> 00:27:12.172\nyou don't have to shut them\ndown every night, okay?\n\n542\n00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:15.184\nSo that's the basic hardware, okay?\n\n543\n00:27:15.184 --> 00:27:17.044\nNow, last thing on the switches, and\n\n544\n00:27:17.044 --> 00:27:20.184\nwe still got to actually talk about\na few pieces of hardware, but\n\n545\n00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:24.170\nI'm running out of time very quickly here,\nis that when you start to see this.\n\n546\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.790\nDaniel, there's something that is\nconspicuously missing from the outside\n\n547\n00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.190\nof this device, right?\n\n548\n00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.377\nSo, let me see if you can spot it here,\nDan, okay?\n\n549\n00:27:33.377 --> 00:27:35.617\nSo we know we have all ports,\nif that makes sense.\n\n550\n00:27:35.617 --> 00:27:39.979\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n551\n00:27:39.979 --> 00:27:41.504\n&gt;&gt; Not normally, but on the outer cover,\n\n552\n00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:42.250\nyou'd have that.\n\n553\n00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.610\nBut then on the back side here,\n\n554\n00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.406\nI have a power plug.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n555\n00:27:46.406 --> 00:27:47.212\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n556\n00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:52.080\nI have a port for a redundant power\nsupply or a remote power supply.\n\n557\n00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.130\nHave a console port.\n\n558\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:59.490\nThere's something that\nmight kind of be missing.\n\n559\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.140\nWhat do you think might be missing here?\n&gt;&gt; Well, one might be wondering where\n\n560\n00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.742\nthe heck the power button is.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n561\n00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:06.430\nSo yeah, all the sudden, you're like,\n\n562\n00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.570\nhey wait a minute,\nhow do we turn these things off?\n\n563\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.740\nYou just unplug the power.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n564\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.410\n&gt;&gt; When you turn them off,\n\n565\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.210\nyou plug it back in.\n\n566\n00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.910\nThat is pretty much it when it comes\ndown to the hardware on a CISCO switch.\n\n567\n00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.780\nThere is no external on, off button.\n\n568\n00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.693\nSo if you need to reset one you kind\nof unplug it, wait a few seconds.\n\n569\n00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:28.819\nI usually count to 10 or\n15, heck, even 30.\n\n570\n00:28:28.819 --> 00:28:30.634\nOr go and get a cup of coffee and\nplug it back in, but\n\n571\n00:28:30.634 --> 00:28:33.540\nit depends on what you need.\n&gt;&gt; I make a poor man's power button called\n\n572\n00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.147\na power strip and\nit has a button on there.\n\n573\n00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:37.423\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you turn it off, yeah.\n\n574\n00:28:37.423 --> 00:28:39.300\nThat's what you end up doing, right?\n\n575\n00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.162\nSo that's exactly what happens here.\n\n576\n00:28:41.162 --> 00:28:42.681\nSo there's no power.\n\n577\n00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:45.836\nOnce you turn it on, it is on, okay?\n\n578\n00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:47.573\nAnd that's pretty much it, okay?\n\n579\n00:28:47.573 --> 00:28:51.683\nSo the other thing that also is kind of\nneat about the way that switches work or\n\n580\n00:28:51.683 --> 00:28:54.845\nmaybe not so\nneat depending on your perspective, right?\n\n581\n00:28:54.845 --> 00:29:01.160\nIs it means that every single port by\ndefault when you turn it on is on, okay.\n\n582\n00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.660\nSo this means that as soon as you plug\nit in and once the power cycles idle\n\n583\n00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.130\ndown like you expect, just like your\ncomputer once you get it ready to go.\n\n584\n00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.940\nYou plug in a network cable and\n\n585\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.630\nthere's a device on the other end that\ngoes, sure let's network, lets do it.\n\n586\n00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.180\nSo there's nothing that\nstops it from doing that.\n\n587\n00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.430\nFrom a security standpoint,\nthat may be a bad thing as well.\n\n588\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.390\nSo we'll talk about some of that as we go\nthrough some of the other configuration\n\n589\n00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.700\nthat we have to do.\n\n590\n00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.170\nBut overall, Daniel when we\nstart talking about a switch,\n\n591\n00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.990\nwe're at least taking a look and\nseeing just kind of the basic nature, so\n\n592\n00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.620\nwe've taken a look at the hardware inside\nas well as discussed the outside here.\n\n593\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.480\nAnd these are usually the components\nthat we'll have to handle.\n\n594\n00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.230\nSo at least one down.\n\n595\n00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:41.710\nBut we still have to talk about something\nlike the ASA just briefly we're not gonna\n\n596\n00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.220\nspend a lot of time in there.\n\n597\n00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.760\nBut we're also gonna take\na look at a router and\n\n598\n00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.890\nsee some of the different ways\nthat we can configure a router.\n\n599\n00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:49.890\nSometimes you can open them up,\n\n600\n00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.540\nsometimes you can't, unless we show you\na big one is what I'm gonna show you.\n\n601\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.680\nSo, Daniel that's enough for at least this\nparticular episode, but we still have\n\n602\n00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.620\na couple hardware devices to get.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n603\n00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.580\nWell, it's always cool to\nget our hands dirty and\n\n604\n00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.500\nactually handle some of the hardware\nthat we're so used to hearing about, but\n\n605\n00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.430\nmaybe have never seen or\nhave the privy to be around.\n\n606\n00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.070\nAnd now we get a little\nmore familiar with it so\n\n607\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.900\nwe can understand,\nI know what the ports look like.\n\n608\n00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.030\nI know there's lights on it.\n\n609\n00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.640\nI know some of the ideas that\ngo into the design of the case,\n\n610\n00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.820\nlike the yellow rings that\nRonnie was talking about.\n\n611\n00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.880\nThat's gonna help you actually start\nto design networks and whether or not\n\n612\n00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.830\na piece of equipment is gonna be right for\nthat network when you do that designation.\n\n613\n00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.130\nRonnie, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n614\n00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.390\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in the next episode, so\n\n615\n00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.620\nwe continue this walk down hardware lane.\n\n616\n00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.450\nBut as you've said, we're out of time for\nthis one, so we're gonna call it a day.\n\n617\n00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n618\n00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.836\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n619\n00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:40.823\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n620\n00:30:40.823 --> 00:30:46.997\n[MUSIC]\n\n621\n00:30:46.997 --> 00:30:50.217\nThank you for watching

00:00:07.489\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:10.610\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.690\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.821\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:21.721\nin today's episode we continue\nwith more on our CCEMT series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.509\nAnd of course joining us back in the\nstudio, yet again, lending his expertise,\n\n10\n00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.080\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.560\nRonnie, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.770\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel,\nthank you for having me back on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.300\nAs we continue to interact with\nsome of the Cisco devices, and\n\n14\n00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.300\nwe're kind of, I kind of changed\nthe order of a few things here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.000\nRemember to add the CCENT\nlevel as you get hired.\n\n16\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.360\nYou're more than likely to encounter\nswitches, routers and ASAs.\n\n17\n00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.840\nAnd today, we're gonna take\na look at ASAs and routers so\n\n18\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.400\nthat we can finish out the trio of\ndevices that we're more than likely see.\n\n19\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.680\nNow, is that all that there is?\n\n20\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.090\nNo, there's plenty of other devices,\nbut at least for\n\n21\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.920\nus these are meat and potatoes.\n\n22\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.260\nThese are the basic devices that we\nare more than likely to encounter.\n\n23\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.110\nAnd we are now going to take a look\nat the idea of the Cisco ASA.\n\n24\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.360\nSo in our last episode when we\ntalked about the switch and\n\n25\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390\nwe took a look at that,\nwe're doing the same thing.\n\n26\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.339\nWe're going to look at everything but\nthe inside.\n\n27\n00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:21.850\nThe inside is actually plainer than\nwhat we saw inside of the switch.\n\n28\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.770\nIt really is a small circuit board, and\nthe only thing that's really different is\n\n29\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.520\nthat some of them you\ncan upgrade the RAM to.\n\n30\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.780\nBut even then, it can be a relatively\nexpensive venture to upgrade the RAM.\n\n31\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.200\nBecause of the way that Cisco\nhas designed their boards and\n\n32\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.710\neverything else, it likes some RAM sticks,\nand some of them it doesn't.\n\n33\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.400\nSo it can be an expensive venture if you\ndon't know exactly what brand to get, and\n\n34\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.940\nexactly how that works.\n\n35\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.610\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right into it, and\n\n36\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.480\non my desk here as we start to do this\nwe have what we call a Cisco ASA.\n\n37\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.300\nNow most of the Cisco ASAs today have, I\ndon't want to say gone by the way side but\n\n38\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.800\nthey've been replaced with something\nthat has more features, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.190\nMore feature rich here,\nwhich is going to be the Cisco firepower.\n\n40\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.470\nSo instead, on this one,\nlet's start off with the very front and\n\n41\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.240\nwhat we end up seeing here\nwhich is pretty simple by far.\n\n42\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.509\nSo here is, of course, the front cover and\nyou see the model of this device,\n\n43\n00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.330\nthe Cisco ASA 5505 series.\n\n44\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.518\nThis is their smallest model and\n\n45\n00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:28.490\nthis is great inside of\nthings like branch offices.\n\n46\n00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.180\nAnd you're likely to see\nsomething like this as well, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.776\nSo a lot of times in small branch\noffices here this is the device.\n\n48\n00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:39.323\nOr somebody that's actually\ngot a home environment and\n\n49\n00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:44.164\nyou need to make sure that you have\na secure VPN that's always up in between.\n\n50\n00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.000\nThis is the rock solid device to go with.\n\n51\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.630\nBut today you'll actually see the ones\nthat they call 5506 come out,\n\n52\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.980\nor 550 something, or 5515.\n\n53\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.443\nWhen you start seeing those\nwith the letter X and stuff,\n\n54\n00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.880\nthey are more advanced features,\nso you'll see that.\n\n55\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.244\nBut this series,\nthe 5505 is the smallest, and\n\n56\n00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:09.536\nthere is a 5510, a 20 and\nI think there's a 40 after that.\n\n57\n00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:14.179\nAnd then there's an 80 which is enterprise\nthat's as big as a regular switch and\n\n58\n00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:18.370\nthose things get incredible\nexpensive as you go through.\n\n59\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.160\nNow with this one, this is kind\nof limited in what you see here.\n\n60\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.580\nSo notice that actually does tell us.\n\n61\n00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.570\nI don't know, Aubrey, if we can\nzoom in on that a little bit more.\n\n62\n00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.615\nI'll try to move my hand so\nit can focus and what needs to.\n\n63\n00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:39.270\nCuz it's hard for me to point it out on\nthe bottom where you see the yellow there,\n\n64\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.820\nthat actually says 100 megabit.\n\n65\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.350\nSo this particular switch here,\n\n66\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.060\nand the port's on the back,\nall 100 megabit switches.\n\n67\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.680\nAs you start getting more advanced\nfeatures you'll see of course gigabit\n\n68\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.870\nports is what you're likely to see.\n\n69\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.010\nAnd then you have your link and\nactivity light as well.\n\n70\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.170\nYou plug a device in,\n\n71\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.290\nit automatically shows you the link which\nmeans it does recognize the device.\n\n72\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.157\nThe top one, or I can't remember,\nusually the top one there,\n\n73\n00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:09.585\nif it blinks it tends to actually show\nyou that there's activity going on.\n\n74\n00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:13.712\nIn other words you are sending, you of\ncourse also have power and status, and\n\n75\n00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.248\nwhether or not you have VPN.\n\n76\n00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:17.976\nAnd then of course some other\nthings that you have up here,\n\n77\n00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:19.430\nthat's pretty much about it.\n\n78\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.580\nNow there is a strange port over on\nthe lower left-hand corner of this device\n\n79\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.630\nwhich is a USB Port.\n\n80\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.030\nAnd notice they've actually\nlabeled it as zero.\n\n81\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.620\nIn theory this can be a USB\nmanagement port over here,\n\n82\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.860\nI've never seen anybody use it okay?\n\n83\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.200\nSo this is kinda the device that you again\nwill end up putting up as your firewall\n\n84\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.400\nas what you'll see.\n\n85\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.700\nIt's not exactly rack-mounted,\nit's actually meant to actually sit\n\n86\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.770\non a device and you see where\nthey planted these feet on here.\n\n87\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.970\nAnd you're probably wondering like,\nwow, shameless advertising.\n\n88\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.514\nWell, to a point hey, but\nthe serial number's right behind here.\n\n89\n00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:59.447\nAnd Daniel, I wanted to make sure that\nI covered that up right now in the lan\n\n90\n00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:03.110\nthat Cisco has of the recording of this,\nright?\n\n91\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.442\nThey found some vulnerabilities\nwith the original VPN, right?\n\n92\n00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:07.050\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n93\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.540\n&gt;&gt; So one of the ways that\nyou can fix that is that\n\n94\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.240\nif you don't have a current\nservice contract with Cisco.\n\n95\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.609\nIs that all you have to do is call them\nand you say, hey I read about this and\n\n96\n00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:18.940\nthis link,\nyou could them the link of the router.\n\n97\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.940\nAnd then you can give them serial number\nso in theory I'm trying to obscure this.\n\n98\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Because we still need to do it to this\n\n99\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.040\ndevice right here.\n\n100\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.096\nSo yeah, I don't want somebody\nto get this and go and\n\n101\n00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:36.650\nuse his serial number no somebody's\nalready called that and I'm done.\n\n102\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.510\nSo we've obscured where serial number is.\n\n103\n00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.230\nBut there's nothing really on the bottom\nside of this that we have to worry about.\n\n104\n00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.430\nCan you get a rack mount of this?\n\n105\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.350\nYes, they do sell n extra rack mount\nwhich has panels on both sides.\n\n106\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.930\nIt's just the metal shelf is what it\nallows you to do and it just sits there.\n\n107\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.780\nIt allows you to unscrew something here.\n\n108\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.870\nI don't exactly remember where that actual\nallows you to mount it directly on to that\n\n109\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.370\npart, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.540\nSo then the other part of this, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.850\nDepending on how much money\nyou're willing to spend,\n\n112\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.240\nthis is that security services card slot.\n\n113\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.230\nAnd on the front where I\nkind of went over that SSC,\n\n114\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.440\nif you have one of those, that's where\nyou'll actually be plugging that thing in.\n\n115\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.550\nThat expands the capabilities of your\nASA is this particular slot here.\n\n116\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.240\nNow, when you start adding\nin module like this,\n\n117\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.660\nthis already by itself was\nan expensive device, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.860\nBy itself, but\n\n119\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.550\nwhen you start adding that in that makes\nit a really, really expensive device.\n\n120\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.065\nThese types of add-in modules that\nare hardware set and everything else,\n\n121\n00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.811\nespecially for security features.\n\n122\n00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:46.690\nAnd what it does, it nearly doubles\nthe price of some of these things.\n\n123\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.837\nSo, yeah, you don't tend to see a lot of\nthem, but you know, if you do have that,\n\n124\n00:06:50.837 --> 00:06:53.325\nthat's a very fancy ASA,\ntoo, though, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:57.044\nYou'll also end up seeing\nthat here's these ports.\n\n126\n00:06:57.044 --> 00:07:00.961\nThey're labeled from zero which,\nunusually from the right hand side,\n\n127\n00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:03.550\nall the way through port number seven.\n\n128\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.550\nSo zero through seven,\nthat gives you eight different ports.\n\n129\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.092\nAnd you can use them in whatever\nconfiguration that you want to, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:10.092 --> 00:07:11.901\nBut normally on these right?\n\n131\n00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:14.460\nYou actually have where\none side is actually,\n\n132\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.850\ngonna be of course representing\nthe untrusted side of your network.\n\n133\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.720\nAnd then the other ports are representing\nwhatever you want to DMZ,\n\n134\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.820\nyour own LAN, whatever you want to do.\n\n135\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.108\nSo, when you actually start configuring\nit, you normally start with the first\n\n136\n00:07:29.108 --> 00:07:31.994\ninside port,\nwhich is usually this port number one.\n\n137\n00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:34.980\nAnd not this one,\nwhich might represent your outside.\n\n138\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.020\nSometimes they change these\naround by default, and\n\n139\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.670\nyou have to look at the actual\n\n140\n00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.160\nconsole when you pull it up which one\nthey consider outside and inside first.\n\n141\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.930\nBut if I remember right,\nthis is your first outside port and\n\n142\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.410\nthen this is your first inside port.\n\n143\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.767\nAnd you start using those from that point.\n\n144\n00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:55.742\nThese last two are special,\nthey have these little black bar and\n\n145\n00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.674\nwe can't zoom in enough so\nthat you can read what that one says.\n\n146\n00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:01.266\nBut that one says power over ethernet.\n\n147\n00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:04.912\nOkay, so these two ports have POE in them.\n\n148\n00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:07.611\nSo if you do have a device\nthat will support POE,\n\n149\n00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.840\nyou plug in those two devices, and\nthen you're up and ready to go.\n\n150\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.980\nAnd I did this with an actual\noutside wireless access point for\n\n151\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.420\na customer as well, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:25.430\nSo they had a Cisco lightweight access\npoint that went directly outside there.\n\n153\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.760\nThis is a great except for the very\nfact that it has a power supply and\n\n154\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.210\nwe don't have any external power.\n\n155\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.242\nAnd I said well,\nlet's take a look at what you had inside.\n\n156\n00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:36.280\nAnd they had this Cisco SN and\nthey weren't using these last two ports.\n\n157\n00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.900\nI plugged it in and\npowered up the access point.\n\n158\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.370\nSo we didn't never have to worry about\nexternal power, it provided enough power\n\n159\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.082\nfor that access point to come up,\nand do what we need it to, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:50.280\nNow, notice that there's actually\ntwo additional USB ports here,\n\n161\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.270\nDaniel, as far as I know, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.320\nI've plugged in USB keys, they do nothing.\n\n163\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.515\nIt is weird.\n\n164\n00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:01.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah as far as I know they do nothing.\n\n165\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.043\nNow today though cuz I haven't\nplayed with some of the newer ones\n\n166\n00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:07.194\ncuz they're too expensive for my taste.\n\n167\n00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.660\nFor right now because I don't\ntend to actually need them.\n\n168\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.590\nBut these at some point at least\non this model at the beginning,\n\n169\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.740\nthey don't do anything.\n\n170\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.480\nI think they would be something\nlike a post upgrade firmware,\n\n171\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.370\nsomething like that.\n\n172\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.430\n&gt;&gt; It may be but I have found nothing.\n\n173\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.560\nI've plugged in [INAUDIBLE]\nsee it to read it.\n\n174\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.640\nSo it won't even read them.\n\n175\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.050\nIt's like, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.230\nBut they maybe put it in there for\nfuture something.\n\n177\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or to actually build a data chain.\n\n178\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Liscence or something.\n\n179\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something, yeah.\n\n180\n00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.380\n&gt;&gt; There's licensing involved\nwith ASAs that enable or disable.\n\n181\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Some sort of functionalities.\n\n182\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so it could be.\n\n183\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.970\nBut at this point we don't have that,\nokay?\n\n184\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.580\nLet's take a look again right here, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.790\nWe of course have the console port,\n\n186\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.920\nthis is how you will begin\nthis initial configuration.\n\n187\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.300\nTaking that console cable just like we had\nand plugging it in here and the other end,\n\n188\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.290\nof course, goes into your laptop.\n\n189\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.826\nAnd you actually need to have\nsome sort of helmet connection or\n\n190\n00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:01.750\nsomething that gives you\nthat access in a console.\n\n191\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.920\nOr terminal connection I should say more\nthan the idea of telling that here, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.320\nSo that's also the same thing,\nthat does the same thing and\n\n193\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.600\nwe'll see that on,\nnot only the switches like we saw.\n\n194\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.210\nWe'll see it on ASA's,\n\n195\n00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.700\nwe'll see it on routers too because that's\nkind of the most direct way to get access.\n\n196\n00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.120\nIt's also the loudest way if you\nactually have everything stored into\n\n197\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.400\na networking closet.\n\n198\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.570\nIt's really loud inside there and\nit's annoying as you go in so\n\n199\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.320\nI don't like to stay in that\ncloset if I don't have to.\n\n200\n00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.072\nNow, notice that the power\nsupply though is different okay?\n\n201\n00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:37.394\nThe power supply connector here, okay,\nis much different than what we saw on\n\n202\n00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:40.331\nthe switch which just gave\nus that power connector.\n\n203\n00:10:40.331 --> 00:10:44.460\nHad that V-shaped connector and\nthe power supply was internal.\n\n204\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.110\nThere's not a lot of space in here and\n\n205\n00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.680\nthis thing is actually relatively light,\nso what did they actually decide to do.\n\n206\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.800\nWell they decided,\noops sorry if I bumped that.\n\n207\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.160\nLook black on black.\n\n208\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.090\n&gt;&gt; Black on black was a wonderful idea,\n&gt;&gt; That was awesome.\n\n209\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.330\nYeah that was an awesome idea.\n\n210\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.780\nSo let me do it this way and we'll make\na little bit of a contrast not much.\n\n211\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.960\nYou have an external power supply okay?\n\n212\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.810\nSo that external power supply, so\nyou usually will see one of those two\n\n213\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.620\non these types of devices as you\nstart to work with Cisco devices too.\n\n214\n00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.600\nNow those power supplies\nthey can burn out.\n\n215\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.535\nSo be aware that those probably burn\nout faster than the internal ones.\n\n216\n00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:26.350\nI've had some problem with some of these,\nand that's because the connectors.\n\n217\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.280\nLook at that, Daniel,\nI mean, that is tiny.\n\n218\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that thing is tiny.\n\n219\n00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Looks a little flimsy.\n\n220\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.500\n&gt;&gt; And I've got this one plugged up\nbecause it was actually a lot easier.\n\n221\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.500\nAnd these things are a lot quieter,\nthere are no fans in these things.\n\n222\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they don't have to\nramp up at the very beginning.\n\n223\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.630\nBut you can hear it just a little\nbit as I turn this thing over you'll\n\n224\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.380\nstart seeing these lights\nactually start to appear.\n\n225\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.290\nAnd that's what will start to happen\nis that this device is now booting up.\n\n226\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.450\nYou'll end up seeing\nthe lights flash maybe one or\n\n227\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.770\ntwo times here as devices\nare actually connected in.\n\n228\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.800\nBut once this device is booted up,\nit does take a little bit of time,\n\n229\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.820\nit's slower, okay.\n\n230\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But once it gets to where it needs to\n\n231\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.040\ngo, it will handle your traffic just fine.\n\n232\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.050\nSo in this device as far as internally,\nthere's not a lot for us to do.\n\n233\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.470\nThe things we have to consider though for\n\n234\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.850\nthe ASA are not normally\ndealing with the hardware.\n\n235\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.710\nThe hardware is whatever it is.\n\n236\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.120\nBut if you get one,\nmake sure you get the one that you need.\n\n237\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.320\nIf you need the gigabit ports,\n\n238\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.100\nmake sure you get the one\nthat supports gigabit ports.\n\n239\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.538\nThe only other thing that people,\nactually two things that people get,\n\n240\n00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:36.940\nkind of gotcha.\n\n241\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.050\nI was trying to think of the proper\nterm for gotcha but I couldn't.\n\n242\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.410\nSo the only two things\nthat people get right\n\n243\n00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.320\nis that they end up buying one like\nthis and then they realize something.\n\n244\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.710\nThat even though it supports\na 100 megabit let's say that\n\n245\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.550\nthat means you're going to plug in your\nISP connection to one of these ports.\n\n246\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.020\nYou have 100 megabit connection.\n\n247\n00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.710\nWell what if your ISP is you don't\nhave 45 megabits, well that means\n\n248\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.734\nthat's exactly what it means [CROSSTALK]\nyou're gonna get 45 megabits.\n\n249\n00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:12.816\nSo just kind of realize you want to make\nsure that you do what it is you can do,\n\n250\n00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:15.489\nand the same thing for the too.\n\n251\n00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:19.927\nEven though it actually says 100 megabits\nyou'll see some of them are actually only\n\n252\n00:13:19.927 --> 00:13:20.899\nrated to support,\n\n253\n00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.270\nlet's say like 45 megabits through\nthe external port as well.\n\n254\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.180\nSo you have to be careful of that as well.\n\n255\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.290\nRead up on the spec sheets as you do this,\nas you actually\n\n256\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.130\nmake the decision to buy one, if you're\nactually putting it into real performance.\n\n257\n00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.811\nIf you're only getting one for\na lab, it doesn't matter,\n\n258\n00:13:36.811 --> 00:13:38.956\nyou'll never hit 45 megabits.\n\n259\n00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:40.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't even know.\n\n260\n00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:44.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was like,\ngood luck getting 45 megabits here, but\n\n261\n00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:47.580\nin a lab setting this\none will work just fine.\n\n262\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.010\nThese things have finally\nstarted coming down in price.\n\n263\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.250\nBut the other thing, of course,\n\n264\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.570\nis what Daniel was mentioning\nabout licensing, okay?\n\n265\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.080\nLicensing is what gets you with ASAs.\n\n266\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.630\nAnd on the AS side, you don't have to,\n\n267\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.390\nlike I said, really worry\nabout the hardware side of it.\n\n268\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.620\nLicensing is what gets you.\n\n269\n00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.320\nSo for example, the cheaper license,\nyou get ten devices.\n\n270\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.150\nNow, that doesn't mean ten users.\n\n271\n00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.430\nAnd Daniel has a laptop, has his phone,\n\n272\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.540\nhas his tablet, has whatever,\nit's only 10 connections then.\n\n273\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.910\nSo if you're going out across unit,\n\n274\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.300\nyou have to count like how many\ndevices are actually gonna connect.\n\n275\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.300\nAnd that's it.\n\n276\n00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.940\n&gt;&gt; I remember when, so\nwe used to put these ASAs out in\n\n277\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.000\nthe county branch offices that I\nworked for, the insurance company for.\n\n278\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.980\nAnd when we first put them\nout it was great because\n\n279\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.070\nnot many of those offices had\nmore than just a few five,\n\n280\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.700\nsix devices, a few left over,\nprinters and what not.\n\n281\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.630\nBut as the proliferation of phones and\n\n282\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.920\ntablets started coming in, people would\ncall and say I can't get to the internet.\n\n283\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.140\nSo we'd log in check,\nno the connection looks good.\n\n284\n00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.840\nAnd then we have see,\nthere are ten IP addresses.\n\n285\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.627\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; That are happening here there\n\n286\n00:14:56.627 --> 00:14:59.860\nare ten connections already happening,\nhow many device do you have?\n\n287\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.865\nWell we have five,\n[INAUDIBLE] well we all got five phones.\n\n288\n00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:05.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whether hitting your limit and\n\n289\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.960\nwe will have to upgrade the license to\nstart supporting even smaller offices.\n\n290\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.980\n&gt;&gt; And once you start doing that right,\nthe prices are not [CROSSTALK] it's\n\n291\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.549\nnot like\n&gt;&gt; Give us an extra couple of\n\n292\n00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:16.043\ndollars [CROSSTALK] it really\ndoes show up [CROSSTALK]\n\n293\n00:15:16.043 --> 00:15:16.553\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to [CROSSTALK]\n\n294\n00:15:16.553 --> 00:15:17.168\na couple of 100 dollars.\n\n295\n00:15:17.168 --> 00:15:18.781\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it can jump up.\n\n296\n00:15:18.781 --> 00:15:23.350\nSo you go from 10 to 50, and\nthen from 50 to unlimited.\n\n297\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.793\nSo it's not like I just need 56.\n\n298\n00:15:25.793 --> 00:15:30.305\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] You\nmean you need unlimited.\n\n299\n00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:33.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which I guarantee you is a lot more and\n\n300\n00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:38.065\nthen if you need the additional security\npacks that may also go there for\n\n301\n00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:42.465\nlike the unlimited VPN which\nis the security plus as well.\n\n302\n00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:44.645\nThat then starts to add up even more.\n\n303\n00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:48.268\nSo otherwise very simple,\nplug it in, get in there, and\n\n304\n00:15:48.268 --> 00:15:50.691\nyou can do some basic configuration.\n\n305\n00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:54.897\nAnd then they have their own software\nthat you can configure the device by,\n\n306\n00:15:54.897 --> 00:15:57.990\ncalled ISDM,\nthe Adaptive Security Device Manager.\n\n307\n00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.593\nThat you can also configure the ASA box.\n\n308\n00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:04.390\nBut overall, though,\nthat's kind of really the limitation.\n\n309\n00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.520\nThere's not a lot,\nthey just functionally work.\n\n310\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.841\nNow if they continue to\nreboot at some point okay?\n\n311\n00:16:10.841 --> 00:16:14.233\nAnd you get one that continues to reboot,\nI can't guarantee,\n\n312\n00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:18.910\nI'm gonna say 90% of the time,\nsomebody's tried to upgrade the RAM in it.\n\n313\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.150\nAnd they bought, like, the cheapest\nstick of RAM that they could buy and\n\n314\n00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.350\nthey put it in there, and\nthat's pretty much the problem.\n\n315\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.030\nAnd the reason why I know that is I've\nreplaced so many of these that had\n\n316\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.200\nupgraded RAM, and they all were like\nthe cheapest RAM that they could buy.\n\n317\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.360\nYou do have to pay attention.\n\n318\n00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.290\nMost of these,\nas far as DSA goes in terms of hardware,\n\n319\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.668\nyou gotta get the ones\nthat they recommend.\n\n320\n00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:44.938\nWhich, of course, are normally ten times\nthe value of your cheapest stick that you\n\n321\n00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:47.510\nbought, easily,\nif not even greater than that.\n\n322\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.020\nIf they actually say, Cisco only,\n\n323\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:56.053\nit might be where it's Cisco only then all\nof a sudden upgrading from a 512 to a gig.\n\n324\n00:16:56.053 --> 00:16:59.470\nYou know, you might get a gig stick for\nlike ten bucks, right?\n\n325\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.461\nGoing Cisco gig stick, it might be $159 or\n\n326\n00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:07.550\nsomething, it can be pricey, okay,\nto upgrade something like this.\n\n327\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.710\nSo just kind of be aware but\nyou may actually encounter that.\n\n328\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.410\nIf its a hardware issue and\nyou believe it is, once again,\n\n329\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.914\nno power button Daniel, which means-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n330\n00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:19.254\n&gt;&gt; Pulling it out or you--\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Can I just\n\n331\n00:17:19.254 --> 00:17:19.856\nconnect it to a power strip?\n\n332\n00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:22.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, connect it to a power strip,\nbecause you keep on pulling that, right?\n\n333\n00:17:22.878 --> 00:17:24.618\nThat little tab after a while--\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to break it.\n\n334\n00:17:24.618 --> 00:17:25.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to break it.\n\n335\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.510\nSo just be aware,\nwhen you start doing that okay,\n\n336\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.750\nbut that's what we're going to see.\n\n337\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.080\nAll right Daniel, so that means if we now\nactually need to talk about the idea of\n\n338\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.296\nmoving to the routers here.\n\n339\n00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:37.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthe big dogs and the flagships.\n\n340\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.490\n&gt;&gt; The flagships of all the things\nthat we're actually doing here.\n\n341\n00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.360\nSo let's do that.\n\n342\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.860\nLet's go ahead and build a router on\nboard and then we'll continue on.\n\n343\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.380\nAll right, so here it is.\n\n344\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.030\nIt took me just a moment to wheel\nthis beast out here, Daniel.\n\n345\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.870\nThis thing is a Cisco 3845 and\nyou take a look at it,\n\n346\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.826\nhopefully, compared to the ASA-\n&gt;&gt; Put your hand over it Ronnie,\n\n347\n00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:03.778\njust to give you some scale.\n\n348\n00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:05.050\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n349\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.640\nRonnie's got relatively decent size hands.\n\n350\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.462\n&gt;&gt; This thing is equivalent, if you think\nabout a regular switch is probably like\n\n351\n00:18:13.462 --> 00:18:15.664\nthis port this is it's like three.\n\n352\n00:18:15.664 --> 00:18:18.517\nIt's three switches stacked\nthat's how big this one is.\n\n353\n00:18:18.517 --> 00:18:21.719\nBut this 3845,\nthis is a beast of a router,\n\n354\n00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:24.670\nthat's what we're taking a look at.\n\n355\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:29.050\nNow internally there's not a lot that\nwe can get access to that will show you\n\n356\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.180\nexcept for a few things.\n\n357\n00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.058\n&gt;&gt; You do have power switches.\n\n358\n00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:32.890\n&gt;&gt; We do, yes and\n\n359\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.530\nthat is actually a good physical\ndifference on the outside of the switch.\n\n360\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.770\nNow the contention in all\nCISCO devices is this right?].\n\n361\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.510\nIs this the front or is the other side\nwhere you plug in everything the front?\n\n362\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Because don't power supplies\ntypically come out of the back?\n\n363\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.390\n&gt;&gt; Come of the back, yeah?\n\n364\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.580\n&gt;&gt; But that has a face plate.\n\n365\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.124\n&gt;&gt; But it has a face plate.\n\n366\n00:18:51.124 --> 00:18:53.689\n&gt;&gt; And the face is on the front, right?\n\n367\n00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:55.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The face.\n\n368\n00:18:55.065 --> 00:18:57.906\n[CROSSTALK] The front of anything right?\n\n369\n00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:59.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I would say.\n\n370\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.520\nBut here it is, so whoever wants\nto figure out that conundrum.\n\n371\n00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.167\nWherever Cisco said,\nyou wanna know something?\n\n372\n00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:09.742\nHere is what we'll do, we'll put some\nface plate on and every other device in\n\n373\n00:19:09.742 --> 00:19:13.300\nthe world the power supplies come\nout of the back side of the device.\n\n374\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.120\nBut we'll do this instead so people will\nhave to ask questions forever and ever.\n\n375\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, this particular system here,\n\n376\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.820\nnotice that this one has\nbuilt in dual power supplies.\n\n377\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.722\nSo unlike the switch that we were looking\nat in a previous episode we see now it's\n\n378\n00:19:29.722 --> 00:19:33.032\nnot even a redundant power\nsupply that's external.\n\n379\n00:19:33.032 --> 00:19:38.610\nNow it's actually internal, and it also\ngives us the ability to have both these.\n\n380\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.526\nNow when you have both of them,\n\n381\n00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:45.175\nthe recommendation is that you plug\nboth of them in, you turn them both on.\n\n382\n00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:49.480\nIf one fails the other one will actually\nwork and they will still do that.\n\n383\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.200\nSo why not just plug one of them and\ncontinue on because that puts a larger\n\n384\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.850\nburden on this one power supply\ninstead of distributing the load.\n\n385\n00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.450\nSo, make sure you actually plus them\nboth in if you're actually doing that.\n\n386\n00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.720\nAnd make sure that they're both powered\nas you start doing what you need to.\n\n387\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.120\nSo when this thing turns on,\nit is a rocketship.\n\n388\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this one is a rocketship.\n\n389\n00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.045\n&gt;&gt; It is a Harrier Jump Jet.\n\n390\n00:20:11.045 --> 00:20:15.369\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is pretty loud when this\nthing starts to suck air through.\n\n391\n00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:17.560\nIt pretty much does that, okay?\n\n392\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.870\nNow you'll see,\nlook at all these rack points here.\n\n393\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.120\nAnd the recommendation,\nof course right, don't just put four.\n\n394\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.950\nRight, two on each side.\n\n395\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.725\n&gt;&gt; Fill every hole.\n\n396\n00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Try to make sure that you do get\n\n397\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.450\nthis thing in place.\n\n398\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.185\nAnd my recommendation is go as\nlow as you can in your [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:20:34.185 --> 00:20:34.930\n&gt;&gt; Don't want to\n\n400\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.990\nown all of the weight on\nyour rack on the top.\n\n401\n00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.595\n&gt;&gt; On the top.\n\n402\n00:20:37.595 --> 00:20:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Because then it gets weebly wobbly.\n\n403\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And they fall on you and\n\n404\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.990\nyou die, no good.\n\n405\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.470\n&gt;&gt; So\nI have seen it happen a little bit higher.\n\n406\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.242\nThe other thing about putting it up higher\nDaniel, now Daniel's pretty tall and\n\n407\n00:20:47.242 --> 00:20:48.352\nhe could probably handle it,.\n\n408\n00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:50.585\nBut once it gets to a certain\npoint even in your lifting, right?\n\n409\n00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:52.070\nAnd you have to remove this thing-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n410\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.984\nit's called shoulder separation surgery.\n\n411\n00:20:53.984 --> 00:20:58.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is heavy, so I recommend\nyou put it low in your switch, okay?\n\n412\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.320\nSo now, Daniel, we're about to do this\nthing that I probably need an actual\n\n413\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.720\ncrane to actually do.\n\n414\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.400\nWhich is to flip the thing over\nwithout causing a hernia first.\n\n415\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.250\nAnd then secondly of course, without\nhurting myself, is the other thing, okay.\n\n416\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.390\nSo here it is, I know it takes\nme about two rotations here, and\n\n417\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.830\nthen we'll see the back side of this.\n\n418\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:27.370\nOr the front side depending on\nhow you want to manage it here.\n\n419\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.000\nLet's see if I can center\nit up a little bit more.\n\n420\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.230\nSo here is where all of the actual\nactivity goes is on this side.\n\n421\n00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.840\nNow when you start to take a look,\nthere really isn't a lot of these for\n\n422\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.590\nthe cover like for what we saw in the\nswitch it just had some screw hole covers.\n\n423\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.610\nOn the edge of this Daniel,\n\n424\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.800\nit looks like rivets are actually in the\ncover itself right here along the edge.\n\n425\n00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.990\nSo they're saying you don't\nhave to remove the case okay?\n\n426\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.650\nInside is just a framework is\nwhat it actually is here, and\n\n427\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.800\nit gives you the ability, in other words\nthese things are all modular okay?\n\n428\n00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.230\nSo everything about this particular thing,\nso\n\n429\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.940\nthis is essentially an enclosure that\nnow has a modular panel into it.\n\n430\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.090\nI want to talk about these and then we'll\nkind of remove some of the modules and\n\n431\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.690\nwe'll put some of the modules in.\n\n432\n00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.160\nBut it works like a regular computer okay?\n\n433\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.286\nSo there is a CPU inside, there is\nRAM inside, there is a hard drive.\n\n434\n00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:27.080\nBut the hard drive is not inside, the hard\ndrive essentially is one of these, okay?\n\n435\n00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.390\nSo that is a compact flash card\n\n436\n00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.450\nwhere the only thing that we normally\nstore on there is gonna be the iOS.\n\n437\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.700\nThe operating system that's in\na compressed format that can then\n\n438\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.680\nbe retrieved to run as we need to.\n\n439\n00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.530\nYou can put back up to stuff on there, but\nusually what you don't see at the very\n\n440\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.120\nbeginning is just the iOS\nwhich is on here.\n\n441\n00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.740\nNow that actually goes\ninto this slot right here.\n\n442\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.850\nAnd when you have one in there,\nall you have to do is,\n\n443\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.555\nif you need to eject it, you kinda click\nthat and that pushes this lever out.\n\n444\n00:22:56.555 --> 00:22:59.353\n[SOUND] And then it pops up,\nand there we go.\n\n445\n00:22:59.353 --> 00:23:05.230\nNotice that this one is also, same thing,\nwhere then you can load it back in.\n\n446\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.290\nAnd you do that.\n\n447\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.150\nThe key behind removing anything\non the back here except for\n\n448\n00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.800\nthe things that you plug in with correct\ncables, make sure it is powered off.\n\n449\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.290\nDo not remove anything that we are going\nto show here with it powered on.\n\n450\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.420\nI would even unplug the power and\n\n451\n00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.840\nmake sure that you have\neverything else here, okay?\n\n452\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.520\nSo once that's done, this particular\nmodel that we're actually looking at\n\n453\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.650\nIt is designed to be expanded and\neven changed if you need to.\n\n454\n00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.720\nSo up here at the top row,\nthis is the only one that's actually\n\n455\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.489\nbeen configured at all, but notice I\nhave these other ports here too okay?\n\n456\n00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:46.119\nAnd up here I have these smaller ones that\nare available right here as well, okay?\n\n457\n00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:49.550\nSo you actually see these pairs\nof ones that are here, okay?\n\n458\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.413\nSo Daniel, let's say we bought\nthis thing off of Ebay and\n\n459\n00:23:52.413 --> 00:23:54.390\nthis is how it came configured, okay?\n\n460\n00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.125\nBut I wanted to change some of these\nto actually make it better suited for\n\n461\n00:23:58.125 --> 00:23:58.817\nmy network.\n\n462\n00:23:58.817 --> 00:24:01.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if default, usually the default\n\n463\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.230\nwould have been that there were smaller\npanels up here too that would cover these.\n\n464\n00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.820\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n465\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Just like this or\nvery similar and then the only\n\n466\n00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.650\npores that you'd have by default are the\none's over here on the left hand side.\n\n467\n00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.230\nNow, let's see if we can,\n\n468\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:18.930\nI don't know how much better we can,\nmight not be able to any farther in there.\n\n469\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.090\nBut on the top here there is\nactually this yellow marking and\n\n470\n00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.699\nwe already said that yellow represents\n&gt;&gt; Gigabits.\n\n471\n00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:26.774\n&gt;&gt; Gigabit okay.\n\n472\n00:24:26.774 --> 00:24:30.142\nSo it shows you the very\nfirst port that we have or\n\n473\n00:24:30.142 --> 00:24:33.880\nactually the second port here is Gig 0/1.\n\n474\n00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.880\nAnd then down at the bottom\nthat's actually yellow,\n\n475\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.210\nis got a kind of a shade\nover is what you're seeing.\n\n476\n00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.980\nBut that is yellow and it goes across\nboth ports and that's gig 0/0, okay?\n\n477\n00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.110\nSo on the way that these numbering\nsystems work here, Daniel, okay?\n\n478\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.830\nThe device that is natively\non the chassis itself,\n\n479\n00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.250\nokay, what is is considered device zero,\nokay.\n\n480\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.450\nThe very basic device.\n\n481\n00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.960\nSo this is device zero here, okay.\n\n482\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:08.790\nSo this gigabit port and this gigabit\nport down here is on zero, okay.\n\n483\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.210\nThe the very first port number,\n\n484\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:15.120\nwell, that should be a zero and then\nthe second port number would be a one.\n\n485\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.938\nSo when you start seeing\nlike the port numberings and\n\n486\n00:25:18.938 --> 00:25:23.817\neverything okay, the very first\nport is gonna be gig or GE0/0.\n\n487\n00:25:23.817 --> 00:25:27.600\nWhich is, I mean you can barely see it but\nit's down there, it's right there.\n\n488\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.070\nAnd this one though, Daniel's,\nis a little bit strange, okay?\n\n489\n00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.880\nIt's strange in the fact that\nit covers both of these ports,\n\n490\n00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.580\nyou would think that there'd be like\nanother port number here, but there's not.\n\n491\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.130\nIt's actually sharing this port.\n\n492\n00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Is it one or the other or is it both?\n\n493\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.290\n&gt;&gt; It is one or the other.\n\n494\n00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.240\nAnd this is something that is stranger.\n\n495\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.090\nSo this one over here on the right\nhand side, it is a fiber optic port.\n\n496\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.170\nBut it requires what we call, of course,\n\n497\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:54.360\nand S [INAUDIBLE] small form\npluggable is what it requires.\n\n498\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.870\nNow here is an example of one,\n\n499\n00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.390\nthis one is not technically the right\none as to one that I was able to find.\n\n500\n00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.850\nI think all the ones that we actually\nneed that would fit this one\n\n501\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.060\nin reality is actually in use\nright now on our network.\n\n502\n00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.940\nSo then all you do is you slide this\nthing in and it locks in place.\n\n503\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:15.260\nAnd now this is where you would use\ngig 0/0 as a fiber optic port instead.\n\n504\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.720\nBut you can't use both at the same\ntime if that happens, okay?\n\n505\n00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.870\nSo it is one or the other if you do this.\n\n506\n00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:22.570\nSo gig0/0, and\n\n507\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:28.380\nthat now actually allows you then to\ncontinue to go down the line here.\n\n508\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.940\nAnd you now start seeing that there's\nactually gonna be another one here.\n\n509\n00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.350\nAnd it just depends on the way that\nthese things are actually known and\n\n510\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.120\nlabeled inside of the IOS.\n\n511\n00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.290\nSo here is the actual ports and\nthen the expansion slots on here.\n\n512\n00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.880\nWell, those things will actually have\ntheir label as well on the device\n\n513\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.170\ntoo, okay?\n\n514\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.110\nSo each one of these will do that.\n\n515\n00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.700\nNow, because I have four\nidentical ones here.\n\n516\n00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.920\nLet's say that we wanted to\nreplace a couple of them.\n\n517\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.189\nSo now, I thought I actually\nunscrewed some of these but I didn't.\n\n518\n00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:04.590\nSo that there would only be\nfinger tight for the show.\n\n519\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.160\nSo they have these little springs\non these screw covers here,\n\n520\n00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:10.730\nI'll lock them in place.\n\n521\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.020\nAnd then all I had to do was pull up\non it and that simply slides out.\n\n522\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.960\nAnd this is known as a HWIC, okay?\n\n523\n00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.560\nA hardware interface card,\nor not hardware, high speed.\n\n524\n00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.880\nWAN interface card hardware, HW,\nis what it's giving me, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.040\nAnd you see it barely let me see if I\ncan contrast that a little bit better.\n\n526\n00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.100\nWhere it says HWIC 0 right here,\nthat stands for\n\n527\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.830\nthe high speed WAN interface card.\n\n528\n00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:44.012\nThey're calling T1 and E1, here,\nwhich is what this card is designed to do,\n\n529\n00:27:44.012 --> 00:27:48.091\nit's designed to give you T1 connections,\nokay?\n\n530\n00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:51.280\nSo they're actually saying that\nthis is the high speed interface.\n\n531\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.400\nSo if I wanted to change that out,\n\n532\n00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.489\nI could purchase one that was designed for\nthe 3845.\n\n533\n00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.370\nAnd then it would come in the mail for\nme, and\n\n534\n00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.260\nnow I could replace it\nwith something like this.\n\n535\n00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:09.005\nNow this doesn't look much different,\nexcept that this one though is actually\n\n536\n00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:15.196\none that's labeled here on the lower left\nhand corner, that says HWIC or ESW, okay?\n\n537\n00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:20.569\nAnd that means this is an HWIC card,\nand that's for ethernet switch Slot,\n\n538\n00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:26.390\nso this is actually a four port ethernet\ncard that we could also instead replace.\n\n539\n00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.140\nAnd with the power off we\njust slide it back in.\n\n540\n00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.656\nAnd then of course you\ntighten it back down.\n\n541\n00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:42.190\nAnd then once you have that you then\npower everything back on verify that it's\n\n542\n00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.520\nactually read inside of the IOS.\n\n543\n00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.190\nAnd you're off and you're ready to go.\n\n544\n00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.000\nNow what about these\nmodules down here okay?\n\n545\n00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.480\nSo you have HWICs up here, okay, these\nsmaller ones are considered HWICs here.\n\n546\n00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.030\nThe ones on the bottom though,\nthese are called NMs, or\n\n547\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.070\nnetwork modules, these larger ones here.\n\n548\n00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:08.440\nThese larger ones are designed to\nadd more capability and function.\n\n549\n00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.930\nNow, Daniel, I'm not sure if we can,\nif you can see this or not.\n\n550\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.150\nNotice that there's a 1, there's a 3...\n\n551\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:15.700\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n552\n00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.040\n&gt;&gt; And then over on the other side,\nwe're not showing it right now, but\n\n553\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.320\nthere's a 2 and a 4.\n\n554\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.360\nSo 1, and then on then on the left\nhand side of this is actually 2.\n\n555\n00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.510\nAnd you have 3 and then over here on\nthe right hand side is actually 4.\n\n556\n00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.320\nThey're four identical,\nlet me see if I can move that up here,\n\n557\n00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.810\nthey're actually four identical\nones of these that you see, okay?\n\n558\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.270\nSo if we wanted to replace these,\nhere, once again,\n\n559\n00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:42.630\nI think that I've actually loosened\nthem and apparently moving it around.\n\n560\n00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:47.236\nI guess it didn't help that I actually put\nweight on it when I loosened them up here.\n\n561\n00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:52.870\nYou simply unscrew these\nwith the power off,\n\n562\n00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.630\nand then it's just a regular base plate.\n\n563\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.940\nDon't throw these away,\nthey're fairly valuable.\n\n564\n00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.200\nIf you need to cover.\n\n565\n00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.990\nSo depending on what you're need is,\nif you're gonna replace anything first and\n\n566\n00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.290\nyour first need make sure\nit goes into port one.\n\n567\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.772\nNow, you don't always have to do that,\nbut it's logic.\n\n568\n00:30:09.772 --> 00:30:12.580\nAlways put what you think\nyou're gonna need first here.\n\n569\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.340\nSo let's say that what I wanted\nto do here at the beginning\n\n570\n00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.080\nis we're actually use this one here.\n\n571\n00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.670\nThat's actually a combo\none which is pretty neat.\n\n572\n00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.560\nSo notice that I can just\nput it in this place.\n\n573\n00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.560\nPush it down to where it lines up at least\nway a little bit there, there we go.\n\n574\n00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.180\nAnd it even gives you\nthis extra handle here.\n\n575\n00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.760\nLet me see if I can show you, handle, so\n\n576\n00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.670\nyou can pull it out if you need to,\nto replace it at some point.\n\n577\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.511\nAnd now what I've done in expanding\nthe capabilities is I've added in\n\n578\n00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:46.656\nfast ethernet ports instead.\n\n579\n00:30:46.656 --> 00:30:50.340\nSo this was just a regular ethernet,\nso these are 10 megabit.\n\n580\n00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:55.070\nSwitch cards here and now these are two\nfast ethernet slots that actually add in\n\n581\n00:30:55.070 --> 00:31:00.270\nmore expandability and\nadd in two additional HWICs as well.\n\n582\n00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:05.860\nSo you can add in more and\nmore devices as you need to and do that.\n\n583\n00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.300\nLet me go ahead and\ndo this one- we'll add another e-card.\n\n584\n00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:10.973\n&gt;&gt; Go crazy, yeah.\n\n585\n00:31:10.973 --> 00:31:12.342\n&gt;&gt; Well, why not.\n\n586\n00:31:12.342 --> 00:31:12.866\nTo this point, okay?\n\n587\n00:31:12.866 --> 00:31:14.664\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n588\n00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:16.580\n&gt;&gt; And we'll do this other one here.\n\n589\n00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.600\nNow, you'll probably not need this unless\nyou are at some point here really doing\n\n590\n00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:25.940\na true serial LAN and\nyou are the hub at your end.\n\n591\n00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.234\n&gt;&gt; Of course,\nyou want to line this thing up and\n\n592\n00:31:29.234 --> 00:31:31.425\nmake sure it goes all\nthe way to the bottom.\n\n593\n00:31:31.425 --> 00:31:32.390\nAnd so there we go.\n\n594\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:37.720\nSo now I've actually continued a,\nnow its functionality is insane,\n\n595\n00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.080\nif you were to do this.\n\n596\n00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.710\nBut this device is designed to handle it.\n\n597\n00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.133\nYou can even add some for wireless.\n\n598\n00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:49.885\nYou can add in some for the idea of\ndoing cellular stuff if you wanted to.\n\n599\n00:31:49.885 --> 00:31:52.359\nThey've got so many different cards and\nfunctions here.\n\n600\n00:31:52.359 --> 00:31:56.404\nBut all this has to be done\nwhile the power is actually off.\n\n601\n00:31:56.404 --> 00:31:59.652\nSo once we get something\nlike that in here,\n\n602\n00:31:59.652 --> 00:32:03.580\nwe are very close to\nbeing what we need to do.\n\n603\n00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.340\nNow, the last thing that I wanna show you.\n\n604\n00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.164\nYou can power this on and all those\nfeature should show up and I wanna show\n\n605\n00:32:09.164 --> 00:32:12.888\nyou the removal of this thing,\nbecause actually you pretty need it.\n\n606\n00:32:12.888 --> 00:32:16.860\nLet's say that you wanted to upgrade\nthis particular motherboard.\n\n607\n00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.556\nSo there's an MB here at the end.\n\n608\n00:32:19.556 --> 00:32:21.183\nYou again, would unscrew this.\n\n609\n00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:28.940\nAnd now to remove it,\nyou don't wanna pull up on these screws.\n\n610\n00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.846\nBut once you actually got it unscrewed\nat least I think it's actually\n\n611\n00:32:32.846 --> 00:32:36.497\nunscrewed here, they have two\nears that you can see right here.\n\n612\n00:32:36.497 --> 00:32:41.201\nAll you have to do is pull up on\nboth sides at the same time and\n\n613\n00:32:41.201 --> 00:32:44.093\nthat will release the whole thing.\n\n614\n00:32:44.093 --> 00:32:47.196\nNow Daniel, I'm gonna get you to\nhelp me here for just a moment.\n\n615\n00:32:47.196 --> 00:32:54.023\nI have to lay this thing down, so\ngo ahead and hold that for, yeah.\n\n616\n00:32:54.023 --> 00:32:57.341\nSo grab ahold of this for\nme up here and while I lay this down.\n\n617\n00:32:57.341 --> 00:33:00.790\nYeah, so there you go, Dan.\n\n618\n00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:01.480\nGot it?\n\n619\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.124\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n620\n00:33:03.124 --> 00:33:09.812\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's no way for me to physically\nbe able to put all that down there.\n\n621\n00:33:09.812 --> 00:33:12.098\nNow, thank you.\n\n622\n00:33:12.098 --> 00:33:14.840\n&gt;&gt; Your welcome.\n\n623\n00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.187\n&gt;&gt; So this is really the motherboard for\nthis particular router and\n\n624\n00:33:19.187 --> 00:33:24.113\nyou'll now see that there's RAM,\nthere's all RAM all over the place.\n\n625\n00:33:24.113 --> 00:33:25.670\nThere's of course, the CPUs.\n\n626\n00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.312\nThere's the AMD CPU right there.\n\n627\n00:33:28.312 --> 00:33:31.675\nDaniel, I can identify that one since that\none actually does say, AMD right there.\n\n628\n00:33:31.675 --> 00:33:34.205\nSo you can actually see\neverything that's laid out and\n\n629\n00:33:34.205 --> 00:33:35.807\nthen the addition of these slots.\n\n630\n00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:41.527\nThey all end up being very modular, cuz\nI plug in to that device to help us out.\n\n631\n00:33:41.527 --> 00:33:44.475\nYou can find upgrades for\nsome of these models here, but\n\n632\n00:33:44.475 --> 00:33:47.748\nnotice these ears and\nhow they're popped out here down here.\n\n633\n00:33:47.748 --> 00:33:50.724\nSo if yeah, right here.\n\n634\n00:33:50.724 --> 00:33:56.014\nSo now when you go and\nput it back in just like a pizza oven,\n\n635\n00:33:56.014 --> 00:34:01.542\n[LAUGH] you slide it in,\neven your replacement module here.\n\n636\n00:34:01.542 --> 00:34:04.860\nIf I can get everything\nlined up the way I need to.\n\n637\n00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.993\nYou don't really have to jam it in\nto make sure that you don't over jam\n\n638\n00:34:08.993 --> 00:34:13.724\nit in is once you get to this point, all\nyou have to do is push down on these ears.\n\n639\n00:34:13.724 --> 00:34:18.160\nI'm lying to you, there you go and then\nthat will lock it in place the way that it\n\n640\n00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.459\nneeds to and then you simply close it up.\n\n641\n00:34:23.972 --> 00:34:28.964\nAnd now from that point, you're of course,\nentire test here is to make sure\n\n642\n00:34:28.964 --> 00:34:33.800\nthat everything that you plugged in\nnow is gonna be recognized in the iOS.\n\n643\n00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.292\nNow you turn it on and you verify\nthat all that hardware shows up, and\n\n644\n00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:39.140\nthat means that you are ready to go.\n\n645\n00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.749\nSo Daniel, as far as our shows go,\nthis one took a little bit longer.\n\n646\n00:34:42.749 --> 00:34:45.622\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We were actually able to see the inside\n\n647\n00:34:45.622 --> 00:34:47.356\nand able to minimize this.\n\n648\n00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:49.299\nHopefully, you don't have to do this.\n\n649\n00:34:49.299 --> 00:34:52.472\nBut because this device and it's modular,\nwe don't have to ever open up the case and\n\n650\n00:34:52.472 --> 00:34:53.736\nyou can kind of leave it in there.\n\n651\n00:34:53.736 --> 00:34:57.370\nBut you do have that ability to remove and\nto replace these.\n\n652\n00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.731\nMake sure you know about the network\nmodules, as well as HWIX.\n\n653\n00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:02.229\nKnow what they do and allow you to do.\n\n654\n00:35:02.229 --> 00:35:06.593\nBut overall Daniel, once we're at that\npoint, that means we are now ready to\n\n655\n00:35:06.593 --> 00:35:10.555\nenter in to some initial device\nconfiguration to really help us out and\n\n656\n00:35:10.555 --> 00:35:13.125\nunderstand the rest of\nwhat we are able to do.\n\n657\n00:35:13.125 --> 00:35:13.699\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n658\n00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:15.882\nThat was a great look at\nsome of the hardware today.\n\n659\n00:35:15.882 --> 00:35:18.301\nWe got to look at a ASA,\nobviously this router,\n\n660\n00:35:18.301 --> 00:35:20.795\nthis big bad boy of a router\nyou got going on here.\n\n661\n00:35:20.795 --> 00:35:22.150\nVery cool stuff.\n\n662\n00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.036\nIs there anything else you want to\ntalk about before we call it a show?\n\n663\n00:35:25.036 --> 00:35:26.861\n&gt;&gt; Well, like everything else, Daniel,\n\n664\n00:35:26.861 --> 00:35:30.251\nthere are sometimes where I forget stuff\nas I come to the end of the episode.\n\n665\n00:35:30.251 --> 00:35:32.719\nSo yes, I need to show you one\nmore thing and you're like wow,\n\n666\n00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:34.350\nhe really got that router up there fast.\n\n667\n00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.707\nCuz it was the last thing\nthat I had mentioned.\n\n668\n00:35:36.707 --> 00:35:40.362\nLet's zoom back in on this very quickly\nand I remember doing this, Daniel where I\n\n669\n00:35:40.362 --> 00:35:44.270\nwas like pointing out these numbers and\nI specifically wanted to mention them.\n\n670\n00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:48.122\nBecause they are important and\nwe talk about adding in this slots here.\n\n671\n00:35:48.122 --> 00:35:50.575\nSo Daniel,\nI put this card in here specifically.\n\n672\n00:35:50.575 --> 00:35:55.378\nBecause it's a combination card\nif the network module itself\n\n673\n00:35:55.378 --> 00:35:58.989\nalso had this which,\nof course is an HWIX too.\n\n674\n00:35:58.989 --> 00:36:00.973\nSo when we talked about the devices,\n\n675\n00:36:00.973 --> 00:36:03.725\nzero is actually kind of\nthe device on the chassis.\n\n676\n00:36:03.725 --> 00:36:08.057\nYou start adding them in then, well,\nthis one which is the first card.\n\n677\n00:36:08.057 --> 00:36:13.116\nSo that actually raises that\nnumber of whatever the fist port\n\n678\n00:36:13.116 --> 00:36:18.877\nis going to be on this one to fast\nEthernet and then it would be 1/0.\n\n679\n00:36:18.877 --> 00:36:22.737\nBut this one right here you can barely\nsee it behind that little thing here,\n\n680\n00:36:22.737 --> 00:36:23.294\nbut zero.\n\n681\n00:36:23.294 --> 00:36:26.275\nThen of course, that means 1/0.\n\n682\n00:36:26.275 --> 00:36:29.817\nWell, Daniel, even though that works and\nwe could continue and\n\n683\n00:36:29.817 --> 00:36:32.320\nwe know what that means this gonna be 3/1.\n\n684\n00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.710\nIt make sense.\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n685\n00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.679\n&gt;&gt; But Daniel,\nI told you that this is a combo card.\n\n686\n00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:40.795\nEssentially, this is\na card on top of a card.\n\n687\n00:36:40.795 --> 00:36:44.064\nSo now, we have 1/0.\n\n688\n00:36:44.064 --> 00:36:51.772\nWe have 1/1, but that doesn't make\nthis a 1/1 again or a 3 or a 4.\n\n689\n00:36:51.772 --> 00:36:57.246\nThat makes this a 1/0 which is fine,\nbut then this would\n\n690\n00:36:57.246 --> 00:37:03.512\nactually be the third level which\nwould be a 1 for the card itself.\n\n691\n00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:08.937\nAnd then the next card, the 1/1/0 and\n\n692\n00:37:08.937 --> 00:37:15.573\nthen 1/1/1 and\nthey would continue to do that.\n\n693\n00:37:15.573 --> 00:37:19.188\nSo if you ended up where there\nwere three different levels,\n\n694\n00:37:19.188 --> 00:37:21.004\neverything up here is a zero.\n\n695\n00:37:21.004 --> 00:37:24.124\nAnd then you go to those\nnumbering systems and\n\n696\n00:37:24.124 --> 00:37:27.829\nwe start seeing that down here that 1/0,\n1/2.\n\n697\n00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:32.834\nAnd now this is another type of card off\nof this one, which is the third level.\n\n698\n00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:37.708\nSo 1 slash the first card on\nthat network module is 1 and\n\n699\n00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:40.727\nthen that's the port on the card.\n\n700\n00:37:40.727 --> 00:37:43.753\n[LAUGH] So it can get confusing, Daniel.\n\n701\n00:37:43.753 --> 00:37:46.532\nBut that is something that\nyou'd want to know if\n\n702\n00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:51.184\nyou're ever actually take a look at this\nand you're doing this in a Cisco lab and\n\n703\n00:37:51.184 --> 00:37:54.392\nyou're like,\nwhy are these crazy numbers like this?\n\n704\n00:37:54.392 --> 00:38:00.469\nEvery lab that we did using practice labs,\nit was always just 1/1 or 0/1.\n\n705\n00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:03.235\nWhy are they doing 1/0/26?\n\n706\n00:38:03.235 --> 00:38:04.472\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're like, well,\n\n707\n00:38:04.472 --> 00:38:06.451\nthat's because they've actually done\nsomething a little bit different.\n\n708\n00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.261\nI'm joking on 26, but\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n709\n00:38:09.261 --> 00:38:11.481\nBut remember that those\nare on a different level.\n\n710\n00:38:11.481 --> 00:38:13.564\nSo the first number is always,\n\n711\n00:38:13.564 --> 00:38:17.497\nwhether it's the device itself\nwhich is zero or the card.\n\n712\n00:38:17.497 --> 00:38:21.056\nSo even if they're only HWIX, that would\nactually be, whatever the next one is.\n\n713\n00:38:21.056 --> 00:38:24.329\nAnd then for us here,\nthe network module is zero is the key.\n\n714\n00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:26.668\nSo this happens to actually\njust be on the chassis.\n\n715\n00:38:26.668 --> 00:38:28.621\nSo that's why all those\nare zeroes up there.\n\n716\n00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:31.090\nBut for us here,\nthat's what you wanna know.\n\n717\n00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:35.036\nCard and then of course,\nthe port on that card and\n\n718\n00:38:35.036 --> 00:38:38.895\nthen the card subcard and\nthen the port number.\n\n719\n00:38:38.895 --> 00:38:42.409\nSo remember that as you continue\nto move through the exam and\n\n720\n00:38:42.409 --> 00:38:44.106\ngetting prepared for that.\n\n721\n00:38:44.106 --> 00:38:46.605\nThese are very important measures,\nbut we do need to know about them.\n\n722\n00:38:46.605 --> 00:38:47.132\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n723\n00:38:47.132 --> 00:38:48.001\nWell, good to know.\n\n724\n00:38:48.001 --> 00:38:50.565\nThanks for\nnot leaving us in the lurch on that and\n\n725\n00:38:50.565 --> 00:38:53.077\nremembering what he\nwanted to teach us about.\n\n726\n00:38:53.077 --> 00:38:55.046\nVery important stuff about those cards, so\n\n727\n00:38:55.046 --> 00:38:58.252\nthat we get the right answer if it\ncomes to asking questions about them.\n\n728\n00:38:58.252 --> 00:38:58.983\nWhich one is this?\n\n729\n00:38:58.983 --> 00:39:01.760\nIf you've got these amount of wicks and\nyou've got these slots.\n\n730\n00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.345\nWhich one is this it's gonna,\nyou might get something like that.\n\n731\n00:39:04.345 --> 00:39:05.914\nSo very good that you brought that up.\n\n732\n00:39:05.914 --> 00:39:08.193\nThat being said, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of our episode.\n\n733\n00:39:08.193 --> 00:39:09.422\nWe are out of time.\n\n734\n00:39:09.422 --> 00:39:11.893\nOur clock it just go so\nfast every episode.\n\n735\n00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:14.907\nRonnie, thanks for dropping by and we\nthank you good folks for watching as well.\n\n736\n00:39:14.907 --> 00:39:17.379\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n737\n00:39:17.379 --> 00:39:18.191\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n738\n00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.284\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n739\n00:39:20.284 --> 00:39:26.375\n[MUSIC]\n\n740\n00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:29.717\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:12.457\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n4\n00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:16.880\ngreeting everyone and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.160\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.010\nin today's episode we continue\non with our CCENT series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.840\nJoining us in the studio.\n\n8\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.800\nYou know him.\n\n9\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.030\nOur good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.830\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.850\nThank you for inviting me back on the show\nas we continue to take a look more of\n\n13\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.770\ncourse getting prepared or taking that\nCISCO CCENT exam and getting ready for it.\n\n14\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.380\nAnd today we're beginning a new topic.\n\n15\n00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.910\nWe've been on networking fundamentals for\n\n16\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.150\nquite a bit of time, we've been\nwatching the entire series in order and\n\n17\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.400\nnow we're jumping into, well, switching\nis what we're actually jumping into and\n\n18\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.360\nthis is actually the part where we finally\nkind of deep dive a little bit into,\n\n19\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660\nof course, the Cisco equipment itself.\n\n20\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.220\nYou need to actually understand not only\nthe handling of it, which we did show in\n\n21\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.110\nthe network fundamentals,\nas far as the physical switch itself but\n\n22\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.950\nnow also, of course the configuration side\nand the operations side of the switch too.\n\n23\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.530\nSo we need to have a solid foundation\nin those fundamentals as well\n\n24\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.180\nbecause that's the way that when we\nstart actually dealing with the issues,\n\n25\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.460\nif you don't have the fundamentals down,\n\n26\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.290\nyou won't be able to understand\nwhy it's operating the way it is.\n\n27\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.220\nSo that's what we're going\nto start off with today.\n\n28\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.710\nSo we're gonna take a look at\ndifferent switching concepts,\n\n29\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.920\nmake sure that we get started correctly.\n\n30\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.240\nAll right, so Daniel, let's start off\nwith understanding the way that you and\n\n31\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.650\nI started here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n32\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.160\n&gt;&gt; And which is not really with switching.\n\n33\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.920\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n34\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.990\n&gt;&gt; When it came down to it,\n\n35\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.600\nwhen we first started connecting devices\ntogether, multiple devices together,\n\n36\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.120\nwe probably came along in the day and\nages of what we call hubs.\n\n37\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes we did and\n\n38\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.860\nthat was the de facto standard man.\n\n39\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.475\nEvery room had a hub up in it and\nthat's how everything connected and\n\n40\n00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.835\nit was easy, it was nice, splits.\n\n41\n00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:55.615\nThere were some downfalls to that and as\nthings got faster we had to move away from\n\n42\n00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.175\nit, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n43\n00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:59.145\nSo when you started that she started\nlooking at the idea of the hub\n\n44\n00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:00.465\nand what it did.\n\n45\n00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:03.355\nIt was really just a point\nof connectivity device.\n\n46\n00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:07.635\nEverybody connected in but it was like\nus still not really getting away from\n\n47\n00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.810\nthe old way of doing it which was just\nrunning a single wire down the hall and\n\n48\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.350\ntapping in that wire.\n\n49\n00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.620\nWhen you started doing stuff like that,\nthat's when you started having more and\n\n50\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.850\nmore collisions.\n\n51\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.710\nThe hub allowed us to hardwire it in\nto a central hardwire device now.\n\n52\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.570\nAnd then it could actually say, look,\nwe're reducing the overall length and\n\n53\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.600\ndistance that we had to go.\n\n54\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.380\nAnd the reason why that was important is\nbecause the longer that old kind of that\n\n55\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.200\ncable went, right?\n\n56\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.210\nIf you took a regular cable and\nyou ran it down the hallway,\n\n57\n00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.540\nthe longer that got,\nthe slower the network became, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.590\nSo now, a hub would reduce that limit and\n\n59\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.360\nthen everybody was just tied into\none central connectivity device.\n\n60\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.150\nThe problem though,\nis you still experienced collisions.\n\n61\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.760\nYou still had a single broadcast domain,\n\n62\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.330\nyou still have what we call\na single collision domain, as well.\n\n63\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.830\nSo that's what we want to talk\nabout right at the beginning.\n\n64\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.030\nSo let's take a look at my machine here.\n\n65\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.230\nAnd I've went ahead and\nI've created a simple diagram for us, so\n\n66\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.315\nthat we can understand what the difference\nis between the two of these and\n\n67\n00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.925\nmake sure that we have\na solid understanding, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:12.475\nSo when we started connecting\ndevices together, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:16.124\nSo I have here just a simple, in the old\ndays, we didn't call it, of course,\n\n70\n00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:17.035\nlike an ethernet.\n\n71\n00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:19.565\nWe called it a bus in the very beginning.\n\n72\n00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.185\nThat's what it was is a bus.\n\n73\n00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:23.815\nAn electrical bus,\nessentially a wire, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:30.140\nWhen we tied devices together to\nthat one bus or that one wire.\n\n75\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.040\nThat meant any time that a single source\nwould want to transmit, let's say,\n\n76\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.070\nto a single destination.\n\n77\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.760\nBecause everybody was\ntied to a single wire,\n\n78\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.110\nit meant every single device also ended\nup getting that transmission as well.\n\n79\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.330\nNow it doesn't mean that all those\nother devices in which they weren't\n\n80\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.990\nthe destination of that packet or that\nframe, that it was actually done that way,\n\n81\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.020\nit means these other two\ndevices would simply ignore it.\n\n82\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.400\nBut they would still get it.\n\n83\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.900\nSo it still had to kinda go okay,\n\n84\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.840\nI hear it, I don't wanna listen to it but\nthere it is, it's there.\n\n85\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.058\nAnd finally the destination also\nend up getting that device as well.\n\n86\n00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:09.610\nBut there did comment issue with this too,\n\n87\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.760\nwhich we really didn't get\naway from very easily.\n\n88\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.460\nAnd to tell you the truth even today,\nif we would still do this,\n\n89\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.210\nwe'd still have these problems here.\n\n90\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.850\nIs that we ended up having\nwhat we called collisions.\n\n91\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.340\nWhen do collisions tend to happen?\n\n92\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.090\nCollisions happen when more than\none particular sending device, now,\n\n93\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.040\nnotice that these two are sources.\n\n94\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.180\nAnd they decided to put their packet or\ntheir frame,\n\n95\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.500\nwhatever it was on the wire,\nexactly at the same time.\n\n96\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.930\nWell, when that happen, only one device\ncan really send on this wire at any one\n\n97\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.400\nparticular time and when both of them\nend up putting it on the wire exactly at\n\n98\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.950\nthe same time, you would get, essentially,\nwhat we call a data collision.\n\n99\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.020\nNow, Mike Roderick,\nour colleague here at ITProTV,\n\n100\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.750\nhe said that one time in class, somebody\ndid ask him what the collision sounds\n\n101\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.380\nlike.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.280\n&gt;&gt; And he started making this weird sound\n\n103\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.860\nand the guy said, really?\n\n104\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.290\nAnd he said, no, it's just an electrical,\nit's a voltage spike is what it is and\n\n105\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.770\nthat's really the truth here, right?\n\n106\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.423\nSo when both of these devices are actually\nout there and a voltage spike happens,\n\n107\n00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:17.598\nit's because you have more than one\nvoltage signal that's coming in and\n\n108\n00:05:17.598 --> 00:05:20.750\nthat's what happens and\nnow the problem is this.\n\n109\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.505\nThe destination never receives either one\nof those packets that are being sent,\n\n110\n00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:26.440\nokay?\n\n111\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.170\nSo that collision would\nessentially destroy the source to\n\n112\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.720\nthe destination connection\nis what we would have.\n\n113\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.644\nNow, the way that this ended up working\nthough, is that they came up with\n\n114\n00:05:36.644 --> 00:05:41.830\na technology that allowed them to be\nable to conquer this idea of collision.\n\n115\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.021\nNow when I said, conquered it,\nit didn't get rid of the collisions,\n\n116\n00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:49.726\nit essentially dealt with\nthe collisions in this way, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:52.867\nThe technology's called CSMA.\n\n118\n00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:57.540\nWhich stands for\ncarrier sense multiple access.\n\n119\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.310\nAnd then the slash and the cd here\nstands for collision detection.\n\n120\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.840\nOkay?\n\n121\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.340\nSo Carrier Sense Multiple Access.\n\n122\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.940\nNow, since I actually put those,\nI actually set it here, Daniel means I've\n\n123\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.410\ngot to do a little bit of typing.\n&gt;&gt; You can do it for us.\n\n124\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try here.\n\n125\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.795\n&gt;&gt; I believe in you sir.\n\n126\n00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:14.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, every time I try and do this,\n\n127\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.606\nit never works out the way that I want to.\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna write the great American\n\n128\n00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:19.848\nnovel and so [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Collision or sorry, Carrier Sence,\n\n129\n00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:22.260\nsee I already mispelled it.\n\n130\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.980\nCarrier Sense.\n\n131\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.190\nOkay.\n\n132\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.687\nMultiple access and then,\n\n133\n00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:35.319\nthis is the /collision detection, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.782\nThe easiest part for at least you and\nI to understand and for\n\n135\n00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:41.064\neverybody that's watching and\nlearning this to understand is this, okay?\n\n136\n00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:42.840\nA collision detection makes sense.\n\n137\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.860\nThat's the easiest part of this\nparticular acronym to understand, right?\n\n138\n00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.540\nThat means it detect collisions.\n\n139\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.120\nI don't know what else to tell you.\n\n140\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.590\nIt says all right, we're going to actually\nmake sure that collisions can be detected.\n\n141\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.710\nWell who are they normally detected by?\n\n142\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.730\nWell, everybody on this wire.\n\n143\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.820\nBut it's really about who sent\nit at the very beginning okay.\n\n144\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.470\nWhen a device now begins to\nput a signal out on the wire.\n\n145\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.390\nThe second thing that it immediately does\nis say, I need to listen for whether or\n\n146\n00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.120\nnot my packet has collided with another.\n\n147\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.220\nCollision detection, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.850\nSo that part is explained.\n\n149\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.050\nWhat is this about carrier\nsense multiple access?\n\n150\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.210\nThe next part, I know this is weird,\nit's working backwards but it worked here,\n\n151\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.740\nmultiple access is because we are on that\nsingle bus and notice we have multiple\n\n152\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.420\ndevices accessing that single bus.\n&gt;&gt; There's a bunch of\n\n153\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.780\ncomputers on the wire.\n\n154\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.185\nNot just one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n155\n00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.740\nso multiple access.\n&gt;&gt; Multiple.\n\n156\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.920\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n157\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.960\nNow is the hard part, right?\n\n158\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.630\nCarrier sense.\n\n159\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.990\nWell, what is it doing?\n\n160\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.688\nIt's sensing that carrier signal.\n&gt;&gt; This is that voltage\n\n161\n00:07:42.688 --> 00:07:45.991\non the line you were talking about, right?\n&gt;&gt; Voltage on the line.\n\n162\n00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:46.606\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you, brother.\n\n163\n00:07:46.606 --> 00:07:47.942\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n164\n00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:50.692\nWe're communicating, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n165\n00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:54.537\nthat's why I went backwards because it is\neasier to understand when people go, okay,\n\n166\n00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:57.959\nif I start off carrier sense like my gosh,\nwe're really getting into the,\n\n167\n00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:00.643\nnot really but if you start off\nwith going, we're going to be\n\n168\n00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:04.067\nable to detect collisions, okay,\nwe're all on the same network together,\n\n169\n00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:07.530\nso, That's what's happening,\nmultiple people are accessing this wire.\n\n170\n00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.693\nAnd now what are they doing when\nthey do that collision detection is\n\n171\n00:08:10.693 --> 00:08:12.896\nthat they are sensing for\nthat voltage spike,\n\n172\n00:08:12.896 --> 00:08:16.370\nthat differential in voltage\nthat they're supposed to do.\n\n173\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.300\nSo when a device normally begins\nto send traffic out onto the wire,\n\n174\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.050\nthe first carrier sense that they\ndo is that they listen to the wire,\n\n175\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.770\nand they're listening for a quiet.\n\n176\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.830\nAll they're really listening for is at the\nbeginning what they call a carrier signal.\n\n177\n00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.320\nThat's all they're listening for.\n\n178\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.930\nAnd that is a certain level of voltage.\n\n179\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.930\nThat's just kind of\nthe easiest way to define it.\n\n180\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.510\nThere's a certain level of voltage.\n\n181\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.600\nIf anything is higher than that,\nin theory, that device should wait and\n\n182\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.190\ngo there may be a collision going on,\nso let me not send that, okay?\n\n183\n00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.780\nSo it's very possible.\n\n184\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.170\nBut there's also that possibility,\n\n185\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.700\nright, that two devices could at the very\nsame time be listening to a clean wire.\n\n186\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.510\nIn other words, nobody is actually\ncommunicating anything at that one time,\n\n187\n00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.030\nand they both sense what?\n\n188\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.540\nThere's no voltage spike on the wire.\n\n189\n00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.540\nLet me send.\n\n190\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.870\nSo they both send at\nexactly that same time, and\n\n191\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.080\nnow they've created their own collision.\n\n192\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.263\nAnd when they do that, they detect that,\nand now, in that detection,\n\n193\n00:09:12.263 --> 00:09:16.451\nwhat happens on the original sending\nmachines or the source machines,\n\n194\n00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:20.314\nis that they go ahead and go,\nwoah, I need to re-transmit that.\n\n195\n00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:23.764\nBut what they do is that they actually\nset what they call a sort of random\n\n196\n00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:24.720\nback-off timer.\n\n197\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.109\nAnd that means, instead of me trying to\nsend it at the regular interval I would\n\n198\n00:09:29.109 --> 00:09:33.917\nnormally send it, let me go ahead and kind\nof make that extended a little bit longer.\n\n199\n00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:35.620\nAnd the other machine does the same thing.\n\n200\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.410\nIn theory, it should not happen\nexactly at the same time again.\n\n201\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.560\nSo they actually backed that off.\n\n202\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.500\nThat's what should end up happening\nwhere they actually do that.\n\n203\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.700\nNow once they do that, they should be able\nto actually put one onto the wire and\n\n204\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.170\nthen next on onto the wire, and\n\n205\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.460\nno collision between those two machines\nunleast that packet happens again.\n\n206\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.160\nNow if you start expanding this out,\nokay, between those two machines,\n\n207\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.450\nin theory, Daniel, right, if we only\nhad these four devices on the wire,\n\n208\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.340\nbecause we've already backed\nthem off to different timing,\n\n209\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.490\nthey shouldn't collide again, in theory.\n&gt;&gt; In theory.\n\n210\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.521\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but what if I now have 48\n\n211\n00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:11.690\nmachines on the wire?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n212\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.910\n&gt;&gt; There's a very good chance that,\n\n213\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.114\nyeah-\n&gt;&gt; Because then everybody starts going\n\n214\n00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.159\nokay, we've backed off, everything's fine,\n\n215\n00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.065\nline's clear.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:18.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can talk.\n\n217\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.145\nSome other computer's saying, I can talk.\n\n218\n00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:22.640\nAnd we collide again.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right.\n\n219\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.160\nSo that's why the more people that\ngot on to this type of network\n\n220\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.190\nthe more collisions would happen, okay?\n\n221\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.480\nSo you just had to deal\nwith it in that sense.\n\n222\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.770\nSo in the hub,\nthat's exactly what and the path.\n\n223\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.650\nAt the very beginning, right?, data that\nenters one port automatically is delivered\n\n224\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.150\nto every other port simultaneously, okay?\n\n225\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.880\nExcept for the one that it came in on.\n\n226\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.930\nMake sure you remember that,\n\n227\n00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.440\nbecause that'll also play a big\ndeal when we come down to switches.\n\n228\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.833\nWe did have connectivity,\nwe did end up having collisions here.\n\n229\n00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:54.490\nBut the key is to understand this, too.\n\n230\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.000\nBecause of the way that this ends up\nworking, whether you're talking about\n\n231\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.593\na single wire, such as the one\nI had at the beginning here, or\n\n232\n00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:05.800\nwhether you're talking about\na hub like I have here,\n\n233\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.190\nit really did create one\nbig collision domain.\n\n234\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.580\nSo this is the way that\nthat works out in the map.\n\n235\n00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.780\nThe less number of devices on a hub,\nthe less collisions you'll have.\n\n236\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n237\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.585\n&gt;&gt; The more devices,\n\n238\n00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:21.738\nthe more collisions you'll have, okay?\n\n239\n00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:23.740\nAnd that's just the way it's going to be.\n\n240\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.572\nBut the same thing can also\nhappen on the other side of it.\n\n241\n00:11:26.572 --> 00:11:30.711\nThe broadcasts also get\nextremely large too, okay?\n\n242\n00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:35.235\nSo if this particular hub here,\nI did a five port hub,\n\n243\n00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:41.182\nthat's pretty much it, but\nI have seen a 40 port hub before, okay?\n\n244\n00:11:41.182 --> 00:11:42.985\nWell, if you actually have that,\n\n245\n00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:47.380\nthat means your broadcast domain grows\nto all 48 of those ports as well.\n\n246\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.800\nSo a hub doesn't actually\ncut down broadcast domains,\n\n247\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.200\nnor does it actually stop any\nmore collisions from happening.\n\n248\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.540\nBut it does give you the way to deal\nwith collisions, is what it does.\n\n249\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.140\nNow at the very beginning,\n\n250\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.800\nwe started realizing that this\nis gonna become a problem.\n\n251\n00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.670\nAnd the problem happens to be it's not\njust in the days of hub networks which was\n\n252\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.597\nthe 10 megabit was kinda\nthe high end of that, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:16.304\nReally, but it's when we started moving\nto the 10 now to the 100 megabit,\n\n254\n00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:18.552\nwell, now collisions would happen so\n\n255\n00:12:18.552 --> 00:12:22.930\noften that they would overwhelm\na network like this very, very quickly.\n\n256\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:28.850\nSo we had to begin to figure out a way\nto reduce the number of collisions.\n\n257\n00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.521\nNow, Daniel, I'm gonna say something, cuz\nin the Cisco World, they use this phrase\n\n258\n00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:35.705\nall the time, but it doesn't make sense\nthe first time you hear it, okay?\n\n259\n00:12:35.705 --> 00:12:36.291\n&gt;&gt; Go for it.\n\n260\n00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:38.672\nAnd so\nthis is the way that they decided do this.\n\n261\n00:12:38.672 --> 00:12:44.119\nAll right, Daniel, here is how we're going\nto kind of prevent collisions, okay?\n\n262\n00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:47.645\nWe are going to cause more collisions.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n263\n00:12:47.645 --> 00:12:48.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:49.730\n&gt;&gt; So everyone is wrecked and then\n\n265\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.924\nthere's no collisions after that, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n\n266\n00:12:51.924 --> 00:12:52.453\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:12:52.453 --> 00:12:53.722\n&gt;&gt; That's what you would think, but\n\n268\n00:12:53.722 --> 00:12:55.840\nit's kind of a weird statement, right?\n&gt;&gt; It is weird.\n\n269\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.736\n&gt;&gt; It is weird.\n\n270\n00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:58.150\nBut what are they meaning there?\n\n271\n00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.460\nWhat are they actually saying?\n\n272\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.580\nWhat they actually decide to do is go,\nlook, remember that the problem that we're\n\n273\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.240\nreally having is that one device\ncould possibly, on a 48 port hub,\n\n274\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.000\nhave a collision with all\n47 of the other devices.\n\n275\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.640\nBut what if I were actually to kind of go,\n\n276\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.847\ninstead of having collision with 48 of\nthem, what if I divide that into half,\n\n277\n00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:21.831\nokay, and only be able to have\na collision with 24 of them?\n\n278\n00:13:21.831 --> 00:13:26.158\nWell, that means I can actually reduce\nthe collision for that one port by half,\n\n279\n00:13:26.158 --> 00:13:26.940\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Makes\n\n280\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.950\nsense, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n281\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.210\nBut it's two collision domains now.\n\n282\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.340\nSo I actually create\nmore collision domains.\n\n283\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.800\nAnd so\nhere's the phrase that you'll hear, okay?\n\n284\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.940\nIs that you'll end up creating\nmore collision domains-\n\n285\n00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Collision domains?\n\n286\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, collision domains.\n\n287\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.100\nBut you end up actually\nhaving less collisions.\n\n288\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.570\nBut if you think about it, though, could\ntwo collisions be happening exactly at\n\n289\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.790\nthe same time in two\ndifferent collision domains?\n\n290\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they could.\n\n291\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can't [CROSSTALK] So\n\n292\n00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.187\nit's kind of weird.\n\n293\n00:13:53.187 --> 00:13:57.218\nBut the second phrase is what probably\nprobably what you'll hear more often,\n\n294\n00:13:57.218 --> 00:14:01.635\nis you actually can have less collisions\nby creating more collision domains.\n\n295\n00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:05.337\nWhich, again, still doesn't sound right\nuntil you actually have it explained.\n\n296\n00:14:05.337 --> 00:14:07.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but now when you start throwing\n\n297\n00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:09.165\nin that terminology of collision domains-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:10.285\n&gt;&gt; I could have 1,000\n\n299\n00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:12.070\ncollisions happening at one time.\n\n300\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.130\nBut they're not affecting any other\nperson in the other collision domains.\n\n301\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.990\nAs long as it's only one per domain,\nI can have as many domains as I want.\n\n302\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.440\nAnd then that reduces\nthe overall collision\n\n303\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.338\nexperience-\n&gt;&gt; For one particular port.\n\n304\n00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:25.120\n&gt;&gt; But the detriment for\n\n305\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.670\nthat domain.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even though we're actually\n\n306\n00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.620\ncreating more collisions, which is weird.\n&gt;&gt; It's weird.\n\n307\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.900\nIt's a very strange logic.\n\n308\n00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.216\nIt takes a lot of factors to figure out\nthis paradox that they called collisions\n\n309\n00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:39.240\nand collision domains.\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel, here's a great point for\n\n310\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.890\nthe exam that's very easy to miss, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.465\n&gt;&gt; If come across an answer like that,\n\n312\n00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:44.881\nwhat's one of the ways to reduce\n\n313\n00:14:44.881 --> 00:14:46.280\ncollisions?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n314\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.740\nyou see something like create\nmore collision domains.\n\n315\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.940\nIf you're not sure, that doesn't,\nhow does that sound like\n\n316\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.520\na right answer, Daniel?\n&gt;&gt; If you had no idea how this\n\n317\n00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.130\nstuff worked, you would say no stinking\nway is creating more collision domains\n\n318\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.120\na way to reduce collisions.\n\n319\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.400\nBut yeah it is [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's the weird thing.\n\n320\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.270\nThat's one of those unusual\nphrases that you'll hear\n\n321\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.510\nthat doesn't make sense at all.\n\n322\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.930\nBut once you actually have it explained,\nit does make a little bit more sense.\n\n323\n00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.242\nYou're creating more, but\nyou're creating smaller collision domains,\n\n324\n00:15:15.242 --> 00:15:17.111\nessentially is what happens.\n&gt;&gt; And basically,\n\n325\n00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:21.332\nit boils itself all the way down to\na collision domain with only two devices.\n\n326\n00:15:21.332 --> 00:15:24.911\nOr one device, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to a switch,\n\n327\n00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:28.076\nbut at the beginning we have\nbridges that separate out into,\n\n328\n00:15:28.076 --> 00:15:30.652\nwell, let's say-\n&gt;&gt; That’s where that separation you were\n\n329\n00:15:30.652 --> 00:15:33.492\ntalking about, like instead of doing 48,\nwhat if I just did half that?\n\n330\n00:15:33.492 --> 00:15:36.602\nAnd now I've reduced the amount of\ncollisions I can have per domain,\n\n331\n00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.217\neven though more than one collision\ncan be happening on one platform.\n\n332\n00:15:39.217 --> 00:15:40.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so\n\n333\n00:15:40.652 --> 00:15:43.920\nnow let's take a look at this diagram.\n\n334\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.636\nAnd I brought this up specifically because\nit is a diagram like something you\n\n335\n00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:51.192\nmight see on the exam here, okay?\n\n336\n00:15:51.192 --> 00:15:54.020\nAnd usually,\nwhen you actually see something like this,\n\n337\n00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.970\nthey are trying to get you to understand\nwhat it is that you're looking at.\n\n338\n00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:03.210\nSo, if, Daniel, if I were to ask you,\nokay, how many collision domains and\n\n339\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:07.630\nhow many broadcast domains are here, okay?\n\n340\n00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.200\nWell, you wouldn't be able to\ntell until I actually removed-\n\n341\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.180\n&gt;&gt; The little bang.\n\n342\n00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.440\nOkay and this is where you have to\npay attention sometimes to that\n\n343\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.200\nwierd symbol.\n&gt;&gt; Cisco has it's own little symbology\n\n344\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.010\nthing going on there.\n\n345\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.520\nIt's a little crazy but if you don't get\ninitiated to it you're gonna get a hard\n\n346\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.050\ntime looking at their diagram.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so make sure you take a look\n\n347\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.585\nlike if you go online you'll see\nthere are official symbols for\n\n348\n00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:34.580\nCisco that they use for certain devices.\n\n349\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.810\nCuz the hub and a switch on the outside,\non a physical hub and\n\n350\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.840\nswitch, they look identical cuz\nyou won't know the difference.\n\n351\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.770\nBut in a diagram,\nthe way that they tend to draw a hub,\n\n352\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.840\nyou see a single two headed arrow is\nwhat you normally end up seeing here.\n\n353\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.860\nSo it's very easy for\nyou to actually kind of look at this and\n\n354\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.920\ngo, that's just a switch,\nthat would actually be what of this?\n\n355\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.530\nSo, you might see where they might ask\nyou something like this on a diagram, and\n\n356\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.100\nsay explain the following.\n\n357\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.550\nIs this a collision domain?\n\n358\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.420\nIs this a broadcast domain?\n\n359\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.410\nIs it a combination?\n\n360\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.950\nWhatever it is here.\n\n361\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.944\nOr they might just ask you\nwhat this device actually is.\n\n362\n00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:16.810\nOr which, something like this 192.168.101\n\n363\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.780\nhas the possibility of colliding\nwith which of the following devices?\n\n364\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.050\nSo you may also see something like this.\n\n365\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.457\nSo don't make mistake this,\n\n366\n00:17:26.457 --> 00:17:29.760\nit's just [INAUDIBLE] just\nshowing us another diagram here.\n\n367\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.820\nIt's because there's actually a meaning\nto the diagrams that they may show you,\n\n368\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.120\njust trying to make you\nencounter different things.\n\n369\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.130\nSo this is not exactly one,\nbecause it's not.\n\n370\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.600\nYou get this idea that somehow\nthey're expecting you to know this.\n\n371\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.050\nAnd the way that they expect you to know\nthis is by dealing with the conceptual\n\n372\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.150\nknowledge between what a collision\ndomain is and what hubs do, and\n\n373\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.065\nwhat switches will end up doing for us.\n\n374\n00:17:53.065 --> 00:17:55.920\nProvided we've got a good\nsolid foundation now, and\n\n375\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.670\nthat means that we can actually move\non to the area and nature of switches.\n\n376\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.070\nSo in between hubs and\n\n377\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.470\nswitches, we actually did end up having\na device that we called a bridge.\n\n378\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.370\nNow a bridge was like a switch in\nthe function and manner that it did.\n\n379\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.910\nBut it did it very slow by comparison to\nthe way that switches function today.\n\n380\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.170\nAnd it was just kind of\nthe very basics here.\n\n381\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.090\nIt was like we need to reduce the number\nof collisions that are happening and\n\n382\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.320\nthey figured out how to do that by\ncreating more collision domains instead.\n\n383\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.070\nBut now we'll move to\nthe realm of switches.\n\n384\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:36.580\nNote now, Daniel,\nthe difference in the symbol here instead.\n\n385\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.890\nIt's actually two single headed arrows\npointing in a different direction.\n\n386\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:47.150\nNow on this one, when you start\ntaking a look at what a switch does,\n\n387\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:52.480\nunlike with the hub, as soon as a hub gets\nthe information in, it goes ahead and\n\n388\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.850\nsends it out every other port but\nthe one it comes in on.\n\n389\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.850\nAutomatically and\nsimultaneously that's what it does.\n\n390\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.780\nA switch though, the data that's\nentering in that particular port,\n\n391\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.650\nit will only go out to the port that’s\ndestined to go out, leave imports 2,\n\n392\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.600\n4, and\n5 alone is what we want to understand.\n\n393\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.660\nSo in this one, we don’t really have\na lot of times here, the idea of\n\n394\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:25.430\npossibilities of collisions between\nthose other ports that are out there.\n\n395\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.930\nWe have a source,\nwhich is going in port 1.\n\n396\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.660\nWe have a destination which\nis coming out port number 3.\n\n397\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.645\nAnd that's what a switch,\n\n398\n00:19:33.645 --> 00:19:38.488\nat least in the physical manner\nthat handles it, does it this way.\n\n399\n00:19:38.488 --> 00:19:43.928\nNow the other thing here that it does,\nwhich is unlike the hub, is that it has\n\n400\n00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:50.560\nto make a decision and how it knows to go\nfrom port number one to port number three.\n\n401\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.130\nA hub does not have any\nlogic inside of it.\n\n402\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.060\nIt is essentially just a device\nthat is hardwired that says,\n\n403\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.240\nwhen something is gone into one part,\nsend it out every other part except for\n\n404\n00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.800\nthe one it came in on.\n\n405\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.160\nInside of the switch though, when you\nsend something into port number one,\n\n406\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.880\nit has to make a decision on what port\nit actually is supposed to go out of,\n\n407\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.330\nbefore it sends the information\nout of that port.\n\n408\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.300\nSo this particular device\nis at least one step above.\n\n409\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.200\nAnd not even a couple of steps above\nthe way that a hub would actually or\n\n410\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.580\na switch would end up functioning for\nwhat we actually want it to do.\n\n411\n00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.950\nSo let's make sure that we understand\nwhat a switch will do for us.\n\n412\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:40.662\nNow here, Daniel, I've tried to reproduce\nwhat we saw when took a look at\n\n413\n00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:44.241\nthe Cisco device interacting\nwith Cisco devices here.\n\n414\n00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:45.130\n&gt;&gt; The physical devices.\n\n415\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.105\n&gt;&gt; The physical devices itself.\n\n416\n00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:48.187\n&gt;&gt; That's a lovely yellow border\n\n417\n00:20:48.187 --> 00:20:49.997\nwhich you have reproduced.\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n418\n00:20:49.997 --> 00:20:54.470\nhere I've created a 16-port switch for us.\n\n419\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.980\nRemember that this yellow one\nrepresents the idea that it's sharing\n\n420\n00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.100\na gigabit kind of back plane.\n\n421\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.380\nOr the idea that they're sharing\none gig on all these ports.\n\n422\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.330\nAnd this other one here is also sharing\na gig in the background as well.\n\n423\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:14.140\nSo this one when we start taking\nlook at what a switch does.\n\n424\n00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.500\nA switch really does\nthree basic functions.\n\n425\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.060\nWhen we start to kind of reduce\nit down to a basic function.\n\n426\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.200\nWe're not talking about\nhow it does it yet.\n\n427\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.320\nWe're talking about it's\nthree basic functions here.\n\n428\n00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.030\nSo what are it's three basic functions?\n\n429\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:36.294\nA switch will forward data\nto its destination port.\n\n430\n00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:41.305\nSo if data comes into this initial port\nit will automatically be able to make\n\n431\n00:21:41.305 --> 00:21:46.080\na decision based on some information\nthat we're about to talk about and\n\n432\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.750\nforward it directly to\nits destination port.\n\n433\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.680\nSo it has that ability to do so.\n\n434\n00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.470\nThe other thing that it can, and\nit's not in any one particular order here.\n\n435\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.220\nBut forwarding is kind of\nthe main thing that it does.\n\n436\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.250\nAnd that's why I had it forward.\n\n437\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.680\nFlooding and filtering,\nit just depends on what happens.\n\n438\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.620\nFiltering data.\n\n439\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:13.290\nThe key is here is understanding\nwhen data actually leaves a port.\n\n440\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:18.690\nIt can forward it to every other port,\nexcept for the one that it came in on.\n\n441\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:27.140\nSo if we forward data and we sent it into\nthis port number one, and let's say for\n\n442\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.180\none reason or another the destination\nof that is supposed to also come\n\n443\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.590\nout of that port as well, well, the switch\nsays, I can send it out to any other port.\n\n444\n00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.900\nI can't send it out the port\nthat it came in on.\n\n445\n00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.380\nThe switch says I can't send it back\nto the port that it came in on, so\n\n446\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.840\ninstead it will also filter it too.\n\n447\n00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.660\nThere is another possibility here though,\nwhich is flooding.\n\n448\n00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.740\nFlooding is actually part of the way\nthe switch learns how to do what it needs\n\n449\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.870\nto do, which is for\nthe data as well as filter the data.\n\n450\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.240\nBut it also helps us in a couple\nof different ways as well.\n\n451\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:10.150\nIt helps us to learn what device\nis also on what port as well.\n\n452\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.450\nAnd it also helps us to address\nsomething that we didn't talk about,\n\n453\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.670\nwhich we'll have to talk\nabout a little bit later too.\n\n454\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:22.080\nBut here flooding means that if I send\ndata into this particular port itself.\n\n455\n00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.640\nIt can also act like a hub and\n\n456\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.370\nsend it out to every other port except for\nthe one the data came in on.\n\n457\n00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.697\nSo that is also a possibility\nwhen we do that.\n\n458\n00:23:36.697 --> 00:23:39.460\nNow when we actually do all that how does\n\n459\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.251\nthat make these three basic functional\ndecisions that it needs to?\n\n460\n00:23:44.251 --> 00:23:48.550\nWell, I already emphasized this idea\nof not sending data on the same port it\n\n461\n00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.740\ncame in on.\n\n462\n00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.740\nBut now notice it makes it based on\nwhat we call the MAC Address Table.\n\n463\n00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.810\nSo inside of the switch, unlike a hub,\nthere's actually a table that's in there\n\n464\n00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:06.400\nthat begins to allow us to map or\nto link that particular interface number\n\n465\n00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:14.400\nto a MAC address of a device that\nis connected to that switch.\n\n466\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:20.450\nNow on the way that it begins to build\nthis data is what we also need to\n\n467\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.040\nat least begin to take a look at here.\n\n468\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:28.100\nSo on making that decision, we need\nto learn about how in the world does\n\n469\n00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.470\nthis particular switch begin to\npopulate that MAC address table.\n\n470\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:38.810\nAnd how it actually uses it to be able\nto Forward, Filter, and Flood Data.\n\n471\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.740\nNow Daniel,\nI just looked over at the clock\n\n472\n00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.180\nhere just briefly.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n473\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.882\n&gt;&gt; And if I get started, this is gonna\n\n474\n00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:46.330\nactually be a very long, long episode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n475\n00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.710\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel, this is actually a good\n\n476\n00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.100\npoint for us to go ahead and\nmake a break and\n\n477\n00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:55.780\nthen we'll start with this process of how\nthat MAC address table will be built and\n\n478\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.900\nhow it uses it to do its decision making.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds awesome, Ronnie.\n\n479\n00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.370\nObviously, switching is a very vital and\nimportant function of anybody's network,\n\n480\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.790\nand understanding that for our exam\nis also a vital important function.\n\n481\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.090\nSo we will allow you all the time\nnecessary to fully explain that to\n\n482\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.900\nour viewing audience.\n\n483\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.700\nSo we thank you for dropping by,\nwe thank you good folks for joining us.\n\n484\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.360\nDefinitely come back for that part two,\nlearn a little more about switching.\n\n485\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.290\nAs for this episode,\nsigning off for ITPRO.TV,\n\n486\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.800\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n487\n00:25:21.800 -->

and\n\n9\n00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:21.932\nin today's episode, we're moving on,\nmoving forward and trying to make some\n\n10\n00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:24.727\nheadway into this lovely little\nthing we've been calling CCENT.\n\n11\n00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:27.771\nAnd joining us back in the studio to help\nus with that is our good friend, Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:28.360\nRonnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.777\nRonnie, welcome back sir,\nand how is it going?\n\n14\n00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:30.880\n&gt;&gt; It's going well Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.732\nThank you agin for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n16\n00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.955\nAs we continue now of course\non our CCENT journey.\n\n17\n00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:39.651\nSpecifically learning more about\nhow switches functions and\n\n18\n00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:42.090\nthe way that they operate.\n\n19\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.793\nSo Daniel, we've already talked about\ntheir three basic functionalities,\n\n20\n00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:51.367\ntheir differences between, of course,\nthe idea here of a hub and a switch.\n\n21\n00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:55.337\nSo we've covered quite a bit of ground in\nour initial episode trying to make sure\n\n22\n00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:58.300\nthat we lay the foundation\ndown that we need to.\n\n23\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.482\nNow were really focusing in on how the\nswitch does the job that it needs to do\n\n24\n00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:05.180\nand whether it's forwarding, filtering, or\n\n25\n00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.634\nflooding the actual switch itself and\nwhat needs to happen.\n\n26\n00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.184\nNow at the same time,\n\n27\n00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:15.542\nlet's also remind you that what you'll\nalso end up seeing here, right?\n\n28\n00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:19.692\nIs switches, they'll still be\none big broadcast domain, but\n\n29\n00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:24.548\nin the end now, what ended saying where\nthe end up creating those multiple\n\n30\n00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:29.343\ncollision domains that will help us\nto reduce the number of collisions.\n\n31\n00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:32.412\nAnd that we tend to end up by\ndealing with this well, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:35.964\nSo we've really taken look at a lot of,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:37.787\ntake a look on my screen again.\n\n34\n00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:42.189\nAnd just the basic idea and foundation,\nremember that this is what we do,\n\n35\n00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.100\nwe forward, filter, or flood data.\n\n36\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.508\nA switch will always forward data, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:52.177\nOr send that data out of that port,\nbut it will not actually end up\n\n38\n00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:56.764\nsending it back into that port,\nthe one that it also came in on.\n\n39\n00:01:56.764 --> 00:01:59.210\nAnd this is what we left off with, right?\n\n40\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.132\nIt makes a decision based on\nthe MAC address table, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:08.020\nSo a switch internally\nhas some logic to it.\n\n42\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.701\nAnd it builds what it calls a MAC address\ntable that links up a MAC address of\n\n43\n00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:17.097\na device that's directly attached\nto one of these interfaces here.\n\n44\n00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:21.650\nAnd also of course,\nto the port number that it's on.\n\n45\n00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.573\nAnd the way that it does it,\nis actually quite interesting here, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:25.573 --> 00:02:29.765\nAnd there are some key terms that you\nwant to make sure that you remember,\n\n47\n00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.070\nas you start to do this.\n\n48\n00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.530\nWhen a switch first turns on, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.084\nAnd everything is ready to go,\nyou start plugging cables into it.\n\n50\n00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:42.450\nAnd on the end of those cables,\nare devices that are up and operating.\n\n51\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.821\nWhen you plug those in, what ends up\nhappening on that one switch board and\n\n52\n00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.090\non every other switch board, right?\n\n53\n00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.420\nIs that it will begin to try and\nlearn the MAC address.\n\n54\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.138\nNow inside of a Ethernet frame though,\nokay?\n\n55\n00:02:56.138 --> 00:02:58.720\nThere are usually two MAC addresses.\n\n56\n00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.357\nOne, of course is the source MAC address.\n\n57\n00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:03.646\nNow I've simplified these MAC\naddresses here for us, so\n\n58\n00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:06.240\nthat I'm not trying to actually-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.032\n&gt;&gt; Remember the weird MAC addresses that\n\n60\n00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:09.320\nare possible here, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.014\nSo the first one a, b,\nc, you see it, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:15.580\nAnd then the destination\nI just did all numbers.\n\n63\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.309\nFor me-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n64\n00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.461\n&gt;&gt; It just made it simple.\n\n65\n00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:22.146\nSo if you see MAC address like this,\nsomebody is spoofing that MAC address.\n\n66\n00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:22.788\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's wrong.\n\n67\n00:03:22.788 --> 00:03:23.859\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is wrong,\n\n68\n00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.360\nthat should not happen, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.041\nSo if that happens, you're under attack.\n\n70\n00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.614\nThat's what actually happening, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:32.140\nSo for us, here's what it is.\n\n72\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.964\nNow the key to understanding\nhow this table that's over\n\n73\n00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:38.659\nhere on the right hand side is created.\n\n74\n00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.079\nSo inside of the memory of that switch,\n\n75\n00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.990\nit's built and\nit's called a CAM table as well, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.433\nCAM stands for content addressable memory,\nso it is actually part of the realm\n\n77\n00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:57.226\non that switch, but it's also\npersistent between reboots as well.\n\n78\n00:03:57.226 --> 00:04:03.456\nSo it has an entry for\nevery single interface here, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:08.060\nAnd also an entry table for\npossible MAC addresses.\n\n80\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:17.040\nBut when you send data in, a switch learns\nonly the source MAC address on that frame.\n\n81\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.252\nThat is key, that is what goes\ninto the MAC address table itself.\n\n82\n00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:25.645\nIt's not the destination Mac\naddress that goes in here.\n\n83\n00:04:25.645 --> 00:04:30.898\nIt is always the source MAC address\nthat gets populated into the table.\n\n84\n00:04:30.898 --> 00:04:35.842\nSo if this particular port which has\nthe green arrow pointing into it.\n\n85\n00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:41.680\nIt is actually port 0/1, and\nthis is just a on the side fact here.\n\n86\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.428\nOn router, we'll see like the interface,\n0/0 gigabyte interface, and\n\n87\n00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:49.288\nthat are fast Ethernet\ninterface [INAUDIBLE].\n\n88\n00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:51.473\nOn switches though it never do a 0/0.\n\n89\n00:04:51.473 --> 00:04:58.330\nIt always begins with a 0/1, so that's\nactually kind of if you need to, right?\n\n90\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.540\nI don't know if they will ever do like,\nwhich of the following is it?\n\n91\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.105\nSo if you actually see a 0/0,\nyou can kind of always rely on the fact\n\n92\n00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:09.950\nthat it's gonna end up been an actual\nrouter rather than a switcher.\n\n93\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.731\nBut always, that I should be\ngetting 0/1 here on the switch.\n\n94\n00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:17.056\nSo when it actually reads\nthe information on that\n\n95\n00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:20.990\nlayered two information\non the layer two frame.\n\n96\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.593\nIt will look for\nthe source MAC address coming in from 0/1,\n\n97\n00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:32.435\nand enter in the source MAC address\nright here to this link here.\n\n98\n00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:36.754\nSo that way, whenever anybody looked for\nthis MAC address,\n\n99\n00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:40.010\nit knows that the port is actually on 0/1.\n\n100\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.767\nNow, after that point, once it does that,\n\n101\n00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:48.442\nit tries to deliver it to\nthe destination MAC address,\n\n102\n00:05:48.442 --> 00:05:53.031\nwhich is going to be 0,\nor 1, 2, and 3s, right?\n\n103\n00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:55.780\nSo all 1s, 2s and 3s here.\n\n104\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.853\nNow, the way that it does that, it has to\ncheck the MAC address table again, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:01.845\nNow at this point,\n\n106\n00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:06.410\nDaniel, I haven't actually got anything\nelse if this is a brand new switch.\n\n107\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.570\nAnd even if I plugged in this guy, and\n\n108\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.518\nit hasn't actually began\nto transmit anything.\n\n109\n00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:16.508\nThat means that this particular port may\nnot of actually sent anything in, so\n\n110\n00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:19.832\nit doesn't exactly know\nwhere it is at this point.\n\n111\n00:06:19.832 --> 00:06:23.820\nSo, we can have an issue of\nthat happens out what, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.607\nSo, how does it initially\nget it's destination, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:31.970\nTo actually be able to send\nit where it needs to go.\n\n114\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.966\nFor this second green line to be\nable to fulfill what it needs to,\n\n115\n00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:38.334\naccording to where it's being sent.\n\n116\n00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:42.331\nThis is now where the switch\nhas to do something,\n\n117\n00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:46.060\nwhich is a process that we call ARC,\nas well.\n\n118\n00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.989\nNow, at this point, it can do that.\n\n119\n00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:53.687\nBut the other thing it can do, is part of\nthe basic functionality of the switch.\n\n120\n00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:57.948\nLet me go back here for a moment, and\nremember that we have this idea called\n\n121\n00:06:57.948 --> 00:07:01.600\nflooding and filter,\nwas not going back in the same port.\n\n122\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.450\nSo let's deal with this idea\nof flooding here, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.486\nSo at this point, Daniel, what ends\nup happening, as it says, hey, I need\n\n124\n00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:14.718\nto get to the one that has all he MAC\naddresses of all 1s, all 2s, and all 3s.\n\n125\n00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:20.793\nWell if it's not in the table, the default\nbehavior of this particular switch\n\n126\n00:07:20.793 --> 00:07:26.310\nis gonna say, whoever is sending\nthis is smarter than I am, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.351\nSo he knows that this\ndevice is probably off of\n\n128\n00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:31.919\nthis is similar attached to a switch.\n\n129\n00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.310\nI just don't know where it is, so\nhow could I possibly find that?\n\n130\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.920\nWell what it will do is say, let me go and\ndo this, let me broadcast it.\n\n131\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.294\nLet me send out the destination frame,\nokay?\n\n132\n00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:48.540\nTo every other port except for\nthe one it came in on.\n\n133\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.832\nSo all of these other ports that\ndon't have anything attached to it,\n\n134\n00:07:51.832 --> 00:07:54.004\nthey're not gonna return any information.\n\n135\n00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:55.126\nBut when it does that, and\n\n136\n00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:58.040\nthey flooded out this port in which\nwe've attached this device to.\n\n137\n00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.948\nAnd then now here is goes,\nwait a minute That is my MAC address.\n\n138\n00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:08.020\nIt will then respond and reply.\n\n139\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.220\nAnd when it actually replies,\nit says, hey, that's me and\n\n140\n00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.320\nit now actually transmits\nsaying that's me.\n\n141\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.130\nIt sends its own MAC address back\nin which now becomes the source.\n\n142\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:26.190\nAnd now at this point, we can then\ngo in here I think, and then go.\n\n143\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.827\nHere is the source, MAC address and\n\n144\n00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:35.590\nthey will begin to populate that table.\n\n145\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.700\nNow the rest of that packet, right?\n\n146\n00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.550\nIt can now send and now between these two\nports It will be able to communicate and\n\n147\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.680\ndo what it needs to do, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.170\nSo that's how it begins\nto be able to do that.\n\n149\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.560\nSo flooding,\n\n150\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.910\nit helps it to learn about these MAC\naddresses that maybe out there, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.050\nBut it may not be out there as well.\n\n152\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.340\nSo that's what will also end up happening,\ntoo, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.381\nSo the other possibility here which we'll\ntake a look at in a moment cuz I've got\n\n154\n00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:06.699\na diagram for us to test our ability\nhere to understand fording and\n\n155\n00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:08.894\nflooding and filtering here for a moment.\n\n156\n00:09:08.894 --> 00:09:12.390\nBut at this point you start seeing\nhow this ends up happening.\n\n157\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.170\nNow, Daniel, what about the restees?\n\n158\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.599\nWell, they're not gonna\nhave anything in it.\n\n159\n00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:22.420\nBut notice down here, Daniel,\nI have this term called aging timer, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.620\nAnd you do need to know\ntwo specific numbers here.\n\n161\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.750\nI know I only have one number.\n\n162\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n163\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.947\n&gt;&gt; But two numbers.\n\n164\n00:09:28.947 --> 00:09:31.688\n[LAUGH] I know you're saying,\nRonnie, you're confusing me with one\n\n165\n00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:33.920\nnumber [CROSSTALK], but\nit's the conversion, right?\n\n166\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.074\n300 seconds, I don't know why but\nthis is the way it is, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:38.074 --> 00:09:42.410\n300 seconds and you convert that\ninto minutes is 5 minutes, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.520\nThere is a default aging\ntime of five minutes here\n\n169\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.030\non these particular addresses\nbeing as MAC crested, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.810\nBut what does that actually mean?\n\n171\n00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.880\nWhy do we need it?\n\n172\n00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.300\nWhat's happening.\n\n173\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.541\nSwitches are designed to where\nif I actually unplugged it and\n\n174\n00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.872\nplugged in a new device, it should be able\nto learn that new particular map here.\n\n175\n00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:06.635\nSo if I unplugged 0/1 here and\nplugged in a brand new device,\n\n176\n00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:09.110\nit should be able to learn it, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.900\nIf not, that means forever,\nand ever, and ever.\n\n178\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.000\nThis particular device is not gonna\nactually be able to learn anything cuz it\n\n179\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.770\nalready has something in this MAC address\ntable right here for that one port.\n\n180\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.226\nSo what ends up happening on the aging\ntime is it actually does a couple of\n\n181\n00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:26.780\nthings here.\n\n182\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.060\nIf the device is plugged in, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:37.830\nBut it doesn't hear anything from that one\ndevice for about five minutes of time,\n\n184\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.680\nit will go ahead and\nit will delete this MAC address, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.160\nNow it's not that it got unplugged,\nbut it says look the device is idle or\n\n186\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.170\nI'm not getting any traffic from it.\n\n187\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.839\nLet me go ahead and remove that because\nthe device may just be broken or\n\n188\n00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.935\nit may be down and it has to be replaced.\n\n189\n00:10:54.935 --> 00:10:57.650\nSo, if I replace it, I wanna learn\nthe new MAC address right away.\n\n190\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.945\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, does it prove or\ntry to see if that's the case.\n\n191\n00:11:00.945 --> 00:11:03.730\nWell, maybe I've just haven't heard from\nwhile, I'll send in some packets and\n\n192\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.880\nsee if it response.\n\n193\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.580\nAnd then if it doesn't says,\nwell I guess there's nothing there and\n\n194\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.340\nthen remove it or just say,\nfive minutes is up, you're out of here.\n\n195\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, normally what five minute of\nidol time, it just removes it, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.752\nSo if the device is\nconstantly communicating,\n\n197\n00:11:16.752 --> 00:11:18.336\nthe timer doesn't go into this.\n\n198\n00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:22.385\nThe timer also doesn't go into it,\nDaniel, if we just unplug this.\n\n199\n00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:24.396\nCuz then it's saying,\nokay, it goes, all right,\n\n200\n00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:25.961\nI haven't heard from this MAC address.\n\n201\n00:11:25.961 --> 00:11:29.100\nIt kinda takes it out\nanyways cuz it's not there.\n\n202\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.840\nBut if it doesn't,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n203\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.581\nSo it actually is aging and\nout if it's plugged and int's just idle.\n\n204\n00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:36.556\nSo that allows us then to learn more and\n\n205\n00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:39.510\nmore devices as we switch\nthem out as we do stuff.\n\n206\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.196\nSo that's when it really matters the most\nin that particular sense when we do that.\n\n207\n00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:48.372\nSo you don't ever have to worry about\nthe idea of this particular table,\n\n208\n00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:52.340\nhaving where it actually has\na ton of old information in it.\n\n209\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.620\nIf the device is just not responding,\nit will get aged out.\n\n210\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.830\nIf it is responding, it will stay active.\n\n211\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.898\nAnd you just wanna say, no,\nI wanna remove that device, you unplug.\n\n212\n00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:04.897\nIt Is going to actually take a look and\nnow when it tries to send information\n\n213\n00:12:04.897 --> 00:12:09.477\nis gonna see that the source MAC address\nhas changed, immediately change what's in\n\n214\n00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:13.238\nhere, and then beyond to continue\nto function the way that needs to.\n\n215\n00:12:13.238 --> 00:12:16.717\nSo it really is about ensuring\nthat we can still do that,\n\n216\n00:12:16.717 --> 00:12:21.380\nbecause there's only a limited number\nof places inside this address table\n\n217\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.610\nbefore it gets filled up here.\n\n218\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:29.090\nAnd that's where an issue can end up\ncausing some problems for us, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.580\nSo make sure you kinda\nunderstand that too, right?\n\n220\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.930\nSo there's a lot of concepts that we've\nthrown at everyone right here, Dan, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.051\nSo there are couple of terms we want\nto make sure that we get down, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:46.400\nA MAC Address-table is how you\nfind the show MAC Address-table.\n\n223\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.050\nWe'll show you that in just a moment.\n\n224\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.805\nBut you may also see another\nterm on the exam card CAM table.\n\n225\n00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:53.910\nIt's not that you have to\nknow what it stands for,\n\n226\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.000\nbut like I said,\nCommon Addressable Memory table.\n\n227\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.140\nThat and MAC address table mean the exact\nsame thing, but it's just the age and\n\n228\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.780\nthe terminology when it\nwas called what it is.\n\n229\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:10.630\nSo sometimes you'll still\nget questions from an older,\n\n230\n00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.690\na pool of questions and you're like,\nit doesn't say MAC address.\n\n231\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.880\nThey wouldn't warn us because they\nexpect you to know that as well, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.130\nAnd also this aging timer, too.\n\n233\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.746\nRemember, source MAC address is\nhow this table is populated.\n\n234\n00:13:23.746 --> 00:13:28.619\nAll right, so Daniel now it's time to\ntest out our knowledge just a little\n\n235\n00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:32.480\nbit here in the process of what\nwe want to do as well, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.260\nSo here it is Daniel.\n\n237\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:40.200\nHere's a particular diagram here that\nwe have open and available to us.\n\n238\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.890\nSo if we were to see something like this\nhere, all of this really does make sense.\n\n239\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.190\nNow, this time notice I actually\nreported the MAC addresses\n\n240\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.070\na little bit differently\nin this table here.\n\n241\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.670\nInstead of the four digits and a period,\nthis time I did the dashes in between.\n\n242\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.270\nExpect to see a culmination of\nall those as your MAC Address\n\n243\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.160\ninside the Cisco exams, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.580\nYou can't say, well,\nthat doesn't look like the MAC address.\n\n245\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.100\nYou may see where it's\nactually the four digits and\n\n246\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.720\nthe periods in between, you'll see some\nof this or you will even see colons.\n\n247\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.171\nYou can't lock yourself into going,\nthat's not the way it shows up.\n\n248\n00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:18.115\nThey'll do it anyway that they want to,\n\n249\n00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:20.960\nthey just want to see if\nyou understand that, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.642\nSo, Daniel, on this switch in the middle,\n\n251\n00:14:23.642 --> 00:14:27.198\nif I were to start populating\nthis table over here, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:27.198 --> 00:14:29.187\nSo if I were asked about, hey,\n\n253\n00:14:29.187 --> 00:14:33.620\nwhich of the following is actually\ngonna end up being in this table?\n\n254\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.220\nWell, it's fairly simple.\n\n255\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.730\nWe just go to port number one and\nthen I find that port.\n\n256\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.340\nHopefully, that should actually be fine.\n\n257\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.130\nMake sense.\n\n258\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.920\nAll right, now, I go to port number two,\nit makes sense again.\n\n259\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.955\nYou should be able to find out.\n\n260\n00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:48.570\nThat' exactly easy.\n\n261\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.500\nSo I'm not trying to make\nit very difficult here.\n\n262\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.720\nAnd let's skip over three for a moment,\ncuz that one's a little bit special.\n\n263\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.933\nFour, it makes sense.\n\n264\n00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:58.340\nThat one is the one that's\ndirectly attached off of here.\n\n265\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.940\nAs long as they're sending information and\nit's gonna learn about the source and\n\n266\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.200\nthen, five.\n\n267\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.860\nAnd I left three here for a moment, and\n\n268\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.640\nI'll also talk about this last\none here in a moment, too.\n\n269\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.140\nNow, Daniel,\noff of port number three though.\n\n270\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I now actually have another\n\n271\n00:15:13.887 --> 00:15:18.980\ndevice here, and you're actually\nseeing a single arrow at this point.\n\n272\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.220\nBut that's actually supposed to\nbe a double headed arrow, and\n\n273\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.254\nI just kind of forgot the other side here,\nokay?\n\n274\n00:15:24.254 --> 00:15:32.580\nSo, Daniel, this is a hub attached to\na single port on this switch, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.660\nSo what happens here?\n\n276\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:40.555\nI'm usually only gonna see one\nMAC address off of that one port.\n\n277\n00:15:40.555 --> 00:15:45.203\nBut now I have two MAC addresses\nessentially off of this single port\n\n278\n00:15:45.203 --> 00:15:46.740\nhere, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.792\nSo how the heck do we deal with that.\n\n280\n00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:52.223\nWell, we're running the MAC\naddress table itself.\n\n281\n00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:56.210\nIt doesn't appear, it doesn't say and\ngo, those two are different, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.183\nWhat it does is it just says, hey, I can\nhave more than one MAC address Per port,\n\n283\n00:16:01.183 --> 00:16:03.055\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n284\n00:16:03.055 --> 00:16:06.910\nOkay, so now let's go back and let's\ntalk about those functionalities here.\n\n285\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.220\nOkay, so Daniel, if I were to actually\n\n286\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.030\ngive you a packet that says here's\nyour information here, okay, and\n\n287\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.670\nyou're actually sending from port number\none to port number five, using this table,\n\n288\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.430\nyou should be able to discover\neverything that you need to, right?\n\n289\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.280\nIf I'm just giving the IP you should\nbe able to know what Mac address it\n\n290\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.320\ngoes out of.\n\n291\n00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.770\nYou should also be able to figure out all\nthat information flooding that I need too.\n\n292\n00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:37.220\nIn terms of flooding, if we flood it out,\nwhat address I'm I going to send us to?\n\n293\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.220\nSo let's say port number one\nwants to send out a broadcast.\n\n294\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.140\nWell which of these MAC addresses\nare we going to send that to?\n\n295\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.800\n&gt;&gt; Are you asking me?\n\n296\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n&gt;&gt; Okay I'm on the spot here.\n\n297\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.710\nBecause I actually know.\n\n298\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Right!\n[LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.670\n&gt;&gt; The floating address, which is all f's.\n\n300\n00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.010\nWe see that in your table right there.\n\n301\n00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n302\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.740\nif we remember back from, I think\nsome of the binary stuff we did and\n\n303\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.360\nthe hexadecimal stuff, we saw that quite\na bit when I wanted to hit everything.\n\n304\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.120\nWe saw that in IPv6\naddressing as well I believe.\n\n305\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, we did.\n\n306\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Is, when you see those f's,\nthat means, I'm covering every bit.\n\n307\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.211\nSo basically the same kind\nof [CROSSTALK] Right Ronnie?\n\n308\n00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:13.772\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the one.\nSo\n\n309\n00:17:13.772 --> 00:17:17.050\nremember that if we're actually\nsaying hey, port number one\n\n310\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.910\nwants to be able to broadcast out\nto every single address here.\n\n311\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.270\nWell, this is what is going to do as well,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.940\nAll right.\nSo, Daniel, A+.\n\n313\n00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.140\nAnd you did good, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.330\nNow, Daniel what if\n\n315\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.230\nport number five though-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n316\n00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.540\n&gt;&gt; Sends to a MAC address that you\ndon't see in the list in this table?\n\n317\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.650\nThanks to a MAC address\nthat is not in the table.\n\n318\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:38.830\n&gt;&gt; That is not in the table.\n\n319\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.170\nYeah, now that one we didn't cover but\nwe're gonna cover it now.\n\n320\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.830\n&gt;&gt; I assume that it would then again\nflood the entire switch looking for\n\n321\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.550\nsub MAC address.\n\n322\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nCuz we went over that concept that\n\n323\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.320\nwhat happens is that the switch\nitself believe what?\n\n324\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.740\nWhoever sent this-\n&gt;&gt; You know what you're talking about.\n\n325\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou know what you're talking about.\n\n326\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.500\nIt could be out there.\n\n327\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.120\nIt could be hiding out there,\nand I just haven't found it yet.\n\n328\n00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.120\n&gt;&gt; I mean anybody could have unplug the\nother device and plug in this device, and\n\n329\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.990\nnow you're looking for it.\n\n330\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.710\nSo, there I go.\n\n331\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.970\n&gt;&gt; So,\nthat's what ends up happening as well.\n\n332\n00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.010\nThe very fact is you have two\npossibilities here in flooding.\n\n333\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.100\nOne is true broadcast, meant to do it.\n\n334\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.410\nThe second one is technically\ncalled an unknown unicast.\n\n335\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.560\nSo, it could be where that device is\nactually sending out and goes, I don't,\n\n336\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.520\nthe MAC address table, the MAC address is\nnever gonna be in this table is there.\n\n337\n00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.780\nIt thinks it's there it's not actually\ngonna ever be in there and it just says,\n\n338\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.820\nall right, if it's not there,\nI'm just going to flood it out as well.\n\n339\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.620\nSo, Daniel, this is where we\nstart having issues too, right?\n\n340\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.640\nBecause this MAC Address table\nis unlimited here, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.460\nWhat if I were able to\nreboot the switch here?\n\n342\n00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.130\nOkay?\n\n343\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.240\nAnd clear off all of\nthese MAC Addresses and\n\n344\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.250\nnow then Daniel brings his own machine\non there and he starts flooding it with\n\n345\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.590\ndifferent MAC addresses and fills up\nthe entire table at that point, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.000\nNow if he does that MEZ\nlegitimate devices.\n\n347\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.620\nThey'll never actually be\nable to get anything in here.\n\n348\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.910\nAnd now that means Daniel\nhas control of that switch.\n\n349\n00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.795\nPretty darn hefty.\n\n350\n00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:08.320\n&gt;&gt; Hmhm\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n351\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.710\nAnd that's a one of those things that can\n\n352\n00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.640\nend up happening.\n\n353\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.490\nSo you do have to be careful.\n\n354\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.970\nAll right Daniel lets go to\nthis idea of what happens now.\n\n355\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.970\nAnd what if I send between,\nokay, on port number three?\n\n356\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:28.240\nWhat if the source if this one 100.106 and\n100.103, will it fold it,\n\n357\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:34.280\nwill it flat it or will it filter it?\n\n358\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.587\n&gt;&gt; So it's trying to, it just trying to\ngo from 106 to 103, that's the actual\n\n359\n00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:42.880\nIt will just connect to the hub,\nI don't think it will even hit the switch.\n\n360\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay so to a point right?\n\n361\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes okay it will end up doing that but\n\n362\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.420\nit won't connect to the switch.\n\n363\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.560\n&gt;&gt; I guess it was cuz it's a hub cuz\nthe hub says I'm shotgunning everything.\n\n364\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.430\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Out of everybody yeah.\n\n365\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.520\n&gt;&gt; Right and so\nyes the hub's default nature.\n\n366\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.240\nWe'll hit the switch but remember\nwhat the switch won't do it says hey,\n\n367\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.410\nI came in on this port I can't\ngo back out on that port.\n\n368\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo when it sees and\n\n369\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.190\ngoes wait a minute your destination\nis off port number three two.\n\n370\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.880\nSo it says,\nI'm not gonna send out anywhere.\n\n371\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.870\nI'm just gonna filter it out.\n\n372\n00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:16.860\nSo it is a very real possibility that any\nof these scenarios that we just showed you\n\n373\n00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.870\nare things that you're actually going to\nencounter not only in production, but\n\n374\n00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.680\nalso a possibility on the exam as well.\n\n375\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.790\nSo understanding the layout and\nthe topology here and what you can get,\n\n376\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.430\nDaniel and I just showed you about three,\nfour, maybe five different possible\n\n377\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.590\nquestions types that you might\nencounter with just a single diagram.\n\n378\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.500\nAnd this is to get you to learn more\nabout how this ends up working here and\n\n379\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.260\ndoing something.\n\n380\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.990\nNow Daniel added in an extra\nlayer up here, right up here,\n\n381\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.410\nwhich is the IP address at this point.\n\n382\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.760\nSo, now we have layer two as well as layer\n\n383\n00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.660\nthree addressing that happens here too,\nokay.\n\n384\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.900\nSo, Daniel we have something like that.\n\n385\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.690\nThere is a possibility specially when we\nstart sending and receiving data, right.\n\n386\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.860\nThat what can happen is, I might\nknow the destination IP address But\n\n387\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.820\nI don't know how to get it there okay?\n\n388\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.810\nSo that means I don't know what the layer\ntwo address is actually going to\n\n389\n00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.370\nend up being.\n\n390\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:16.290\nAnd when something like that happens,\nwe have to actually begin to learn\n\n391\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.600\nsomething that we call the ARP\nprocess the address resolution\n\n392\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.320\nprotocol itself to help us to\ndiscover a couple of things.\n\n393\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.530\nSo here Daniel,\nI made it across another network.\n\n394\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.310\nI see a router right here in the middle.\n\n395\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.360\nSo I know that this is going from one\nnetwork over to another network over here.\n\n396\n00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:43.620\nWhen we do this even through a switch,\nit still does the same thing.\n\n397\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.680\nSo it is very possible Daniel,\nin the upper left hand corner.\n\n398\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.660\nI get a frame or\na packet with a frame unit right?\n\n399\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.390\nThat has all the layer three information.\n\n400\n00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:59.750\nThere's the source 172\n160.101 which is PC 01 and\n\n401\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:07.400\nI have the destination IP address,\n192.168.0.200 which is over here, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.900\nHow do I find the mac\naddress at this point, so\n\n403\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.800\nthat this packet can make it all\nthe way through at that point.\n\n404\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.862\nAnd the way that we do that is through\nthat protocol that we call, ARP.\n\n405\n00:22:18.862 --> 00:22:22.435\n&gt;&gt; Good old ARP right it can be fun and\nalso be a little dangerous.\n\n406\n00:22:22.435 --> 00:22:24.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you know what you're doing but\n\n407\n00:22:24.305 --> 00:22:26.895\nit is a very vital thing that\nwe need to understand because\n\n408\n00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:27.985\nof what you were just talking about.\n\n409\n00:22:27.985 --> 00:22:28.945\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah.\n\n410\n00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:32.745\nSo this is why it's important because\nyou will see information like this\n\n411\n00:22:32.745 --> 00:22:36.385\nbecause you have to discover what\nis going to happen here okay?\n\n412\n00:22:36.385 --> 00:22:41.170\nSo at this point when you do this,\nremember that ARP works on broadcast,\n\n413\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.380\nand that's the key.\n\n414\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:47.010\nSo now Daniel,\nif I send an ARP broadcast into a switch,\n\n415\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:51.246\nremember that a switch, even though it\nkind of actually stops collision domains,\n\n416\n00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:54.144\nand it gives us smaller but\nmore collision domains,\n\n417\n00:22:54.144 --> 00:22:59.570\nis still one big broadcast domain between\nthis side of the router, as well.\n\n418\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:04.210\nSo now that means that the file\nserver will hear it, okay and\n\n419\n00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.590\nalso this router interface\nwill hear it as well, and\n\n420\n00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:12.380\nwhat it last should be asked is,\nwhat is the mac address to 1921680.200?\n\n421\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.208\nWell the file server says,\nthat's not me, all right,\n\n422\n00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:21.970\ndon't care, right?\n\n423\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:27.800\nBut the router might have, in this\nrouting table, I know where that is and\n\n424\n00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.520\nwhen it does that, it actually does\nsomething a little bit strange here.\n\n425\n00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.220\nIt says why don't you go head and\nforward that to me so\n\n426\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.800\nnow PC one Can in theory,\n\n427\n00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:45.740\nPut the map address.\n\n428\n00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.665\nIt's Qs not As.\n\n429\n00:23:48.665 --> 00:23:52.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n430\n00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.510\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n431\n00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.158\nA.\n\n432\n00:23:54.158 --> 00:23:58.252\n[LAUGH] So all as here.\n\n433\n00:23:58.252 --> 00:24:02.944\nSo when this works, right,\nit will now send this on and\n\n434\n00:24:02.944 --> 00:24:07.690\nforward it to this router at this point,\nokay.\n\n435\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.410\nNow once it's on the router,\nit will then still look and\n\n436\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.960\nit will still try to\nforward the 1921680.200 and\n\n437\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.720\nwhen it does that, it's actually\nforwarding it from the router and\n\n438\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.920\nI've got this one down\nhere at the bottom okay.\n\n439\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.605\nSo when it goes to the router,\nit goes ahead and\n\n440\n00:24:27.605 --> 00:24:32.300\nit takes away that layer to address\nagain that says, where is this device?\n\n441\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.422\nThe file server hears it,\ninstead of me try and\n\n442\n00:24:35.422 --> 00:24:39.837\nthen type that in let’s see if I\ncan do the old copy and paste here.\n\n443\n00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.929\nAnd then, paste that right in there and\nultimately,\n\n444\n00:24:49.929 --> 00:24:55.190\nbe able to deliver that right\nthrough to the end device.\n\n445\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.100\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, is RPlug a special\nprotocol that is allowed through routers,\n\n446\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.660\nbecause you're the one here\nthat's teaching this class.\n\n447\n00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.750\nI thought that routers broke\nup broadcast domains it was\n\n448\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.630\nmeant to stop broadcast traffic\nfrom getting through it.\n\n449\n00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And here, we have broadcast traffic\n\n450\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:11.910\nmaking it through it,\n\n451\n00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.465\nso I'm assume there's some sort\nof special thing happening here.\n\n452\n00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:17.485\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not actually making it\nthrough it, as much as the router is now\n\n453\n00:25:17.485 --> 00:25:21.490\nissuing out a broadcast onto\nits own network on this side.\n\n454\n00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.490\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, so\nthe router is making the request.\n\n455\n00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Out of it's other interface and\n\n456\n00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.220\nnot allowing broadcaster\nto have it threw it.\n\n457\n00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n458\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.765\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n459\n00:25:28.765 --> 00:25:30.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I see, I see now.\n\n460\n00:25:30.205 --> 00:25:34.183\n&gt;&gt; So, now this is actually two different\nhubs even though I drew it as one because\n\n461\n00:25:34.183 --> 00:25:36.575\nultimately between source and destination.\n\n462\n00:25:36.575 --> 00:25:40.315\nAt each place along the way\nwhen it returns the traffic,\n\n463\n00:25:40.315 --> 00:25:45.740\nit'll end up returning it to\nthe interface right here instead,\n\n464\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.580\nand so even this MAC address over here for\ninterface 0,\n\n465\n00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.250\nthat will actually change cuz it's\ncoming out of the router itself.\n\n466\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.310\nSo even that will change but\nthe source IP address will never change.\n\n467\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.530\nSo now when it replies back, it knows to\nreply back to this interface here and\n\n468\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.390\nthen the interface knows how to look up,\nwell, in the routing table on this side\n\n469\n00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.120\nand send it all the back through\nto where it needs to go.\n\n470\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.870\nSo, part of the ARP traffic that\nwe're talking about does this\n\n471\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.150\nnow we haven't gotten into that when we\nget into routing we'll see a lot more and\n\n472\n00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.830\nwe'll do this a couple of times.\n\n473\n00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.940\nMakes sure it gets fitted in there but\nthat's also part of switching too\n\n474\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.668\nwhen you actually begin to send\ntraffic now into switches directly,\n\n475\n00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:34.755\nmost of the time, you may have what?\n\n476\n00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:40.800\nJust the actual destination IP, without\nknowing what the MAC address is gonna be.\n\n477\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.230\nSo your switch will also do ARP and\n\n478\n00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.300\nthat is how it initially begins to do\nthat when we talk about the flooding at\n\n479\n00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.890\nthe beginning where we can\nlearn about everything.\n\n480\n00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.450\nIt does that as well, so\nit sends it out to every other port and\n\n481\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.800\nthen usually the initial response\nback from that destination\n\n482\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.870\nis going to be a source address\nreplying to the ARP and\n\n483\n00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.580\nnot necessarily the initial\npacket that came through.\n\n484\n00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.280\nSo you'll end up seeing that as well,\nokay.\n\n485\n00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.170\nNow, Daniel, when we start to take\na look at ARP, all that is great, but\n\n486\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.420\nit's part of the theory that we have\nto know and we have to understand.\n\n487\n00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:19.020\nBut we need to see it on our devices and\non our switches and that's what we'll be\n\n488\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.480\ntaking a look at but in the next\npart is what we'll actually do here.\n\n489\n00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.690\nSo we'll bring up our live equipment and\nwe'll be ready to show you all\n\n490\n00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.510\nthe information on a Cisco switch and\nshow you how all that works.\n\n491\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\nenough with this theory business,\n\n492\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.060\nlet's get our hands dirty but\nthat'll have to wait for the next part.\n\n493\n00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.210\nSo definitely, come back and see that,\nRonnie, thanks for joining us.\n\n494\n00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.540\nWe'll see you in the next part and we'll\nsee you good folks out there as well.\n\n495\n00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.480\nAs for this episode, we're calling it\nquits for ITPRO.TV, I've been your host,\n\n496\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.060\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n497\n00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n498\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.804\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n499\n00:27:47.804 -->

00:00:06.625\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:08.277\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:13.090\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.050\ngreetings everyone and welcome back\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.390\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.120\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are back with more in our CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.340\nAnd joining us of course, back in the\nstudio, my good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.260\nRonnie, we're glad to have you yet again.\n\n11\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.430\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well Daniel, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.020\nhaving me back.\n\n13\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.450\nBecause we are continuing on our talk here\nabout of course switching inside of CCENT.\n\n14\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.300\nWe are now beginning that process.\n\n15\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.120\nAnd we've gone through all the theory and\n\n16\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.740\nnow it's ready to take a look at inside of\na lab setting using the real equipment.\n\n17\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.440\nHow do I see this MAC address table,\nhow does it actually work?\n\n18\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.690\nEverything that you'll\nhave to be able to do.\n\n19\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.060\nCuz it's a part of of course,\nnot only CCENT, but\n\n20\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.220\nevery day of working with switches too.\n\n21\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.600\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n22\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.850\nWe're jumping in,\nwe're using of course practice labs.\n\n23\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.710\nThis is the lab that you'll have access\nto, that you can do the same stuff,\n\n24\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.200\nthey have their own lab guy.\n\n25\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.810\nI've kind of condensed some of the steps\nas well but you will be able to do that.\n\n26\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.010\nI just like to warn you,\nif you like pending this stuff out,\n\n27\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.640\nthat is perfectly great, they will give\nyou that nice big font,which is also cool\n\n28\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.900\nbut also know it's like 25 pages-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.340\n&gt;&gt; But I don't know how much\n\n30\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.380\nyou end up with a rim of paper if you\nare not careful at doing this stuff but\n\n31\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.920\nit is really a handy guide for you.\n\n32\n00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.910\nSo you can actually follow along.\n\n33\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.680\nAnd the great thing about it Daniel\nalso is that it's real equipment and\n\n34\n00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.490\nit's not a simulator so\nyou can't ask for better than that.\n\n35\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.210\nIt comes along with just you being\na member of ITProTV, all right.\n\n36\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.340\nSo we're ready to examine then,\nthe Mac address table and\n\n37\n00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.960\nthe idea of Mac address learning a little\nbit and how this begins to function and\n\n38\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.860\ndo what we need to do, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.460\nSo what we're going to start off with,\nis this particular switch right here,\n\n40\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.580\nwhich is NYCORE1.\n\n41\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.650\nAnd it's just a switch, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.970\nwe have a machine that's attached\nthrough another switch here.\n\n43\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.060\nThat switch is still busy at this point.\n\n44\n00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.440\nI'm hoping that it will come up\nin just a little bit of time,\n\n45\n00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.900\nas we give what we need to.\n\n46\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.270\nBut let's take a look at the status\nof our ports on NYCORE1, first.\n\n47\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.300\nSo let me go ahead and\nget out of user mode.\n\n48\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.488\nAnd then now that I'm in Privilege Exec\nmode, let's do show, interface, status.\n\n49\n00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:27.190\nRemember that even though you have\n\n50\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.590\nin practicality, I tend to do things\nthe hard way, Daniel, a lot of times.\n\n51\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.200\nAnd it's easy just to do a show run, or\n\n52\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.850\na show running-config,\nand look at everything.\n\n53\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.700\nAnd if you already know here's what\nshould be configured on every interface,\n\n54\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.880\nit helps out a lot.\n\n55\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.630\nBut it doesn't show you\nall the information,\n\n56\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.500\nlike the details of the information.\n\n57\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500\nAnd for the CCENT exam, as well as for\nthe CCNA routing and switching,\n\n58\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.920\nyou need to learn other commands besides\nthat one run to your mom command,\n\n59\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.480\nwhich shows you what you think's\ngoing to really get you through here.\n\n60\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.500\nMake sure you practice these commands.\n\n61\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.110\nRight away you start to see where\nwe actually are taking a look and\n\n62\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.660\nverifying we have these interfaces up and\navailable.\n\n63\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.870\nI wanted to show you this\nbecause right here you see where\n\n64\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.800\nthere's actually multiple ports.\n\n65\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.540\nThis one actually has at least 22 ports.\n\n66\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.970\nAnd then it has some additional\nports down here, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.880\nSo we, actually 21 ports.\n\n68\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.970\nI'm lying to you.\n\n69\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.970\n1 through 21 is actually 21 ports here.\n\n70\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.490\nAnd then we have these five\nadditional ports that you see.\n\n71\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.570\nThree of them are already\nbeing used which are gonna be\n\n72\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.150\nfast Ethernet ports up here as well.\n\n73\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.950\nAnd then you have these two\ngigabyte ports too, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.830\nSome of these ports are really\nthey're special purpose right?\n\n75\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.050\nSo for example, these gigabyte\nports down here at the bottom.\n\n76\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.070\nThey're designed for what we call uplinks.\n\n77\n00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.320\nFor us to connect to another switch so\n\n78\n00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.070\nthat we get a good thick bandwidth through\nto those other switches as we need to.\n\n79\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.950\nBut you can also use them in\nother configurations as well, and\n\n80\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.590\nyou see that right here too.\n\n81\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.240\nSo that's what we're seeing, and\nwhat we're actually taking a look at here\n\n82\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.310\nis the status, and whether we\nactually see the devices connected.\n\n83\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.050\nAnd if I see some of these\nthat have connected devices,\n\n84\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.980\nthat means that those devices on the other\nend should be fulfilling, at least for\n\n85\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.340\nthis switch here, starting to put\nentries into the MAC address table.\n\n86\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.600\nNow here's the command that always\ntrips me up when I want to take look\n\n87\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.670\nat that MAC address table.\n\n88\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.500\nBecause I always want\nto type it in wrong and\n\n89\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.740\nyou've got to know it right because\nthat's going to be essential.\n\n90\n00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.440\nIt's going to be show\nMac address dash table.\n\n91\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.250\nNow Daniel, you know, even with my\ntyping skills, but at this point,\n\n92\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.613\nthe one that always get me is I\nalways type in show Mac-address.\n\n93\n00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:44.200\n&gt;&gt; Dash table [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.540\n&gt;&gt; And I don't even do the dash table,\n\n95\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.740\nbecause I just think Mac address is being-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n96\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.688\nUnit-\n&gt;&gt; As one word, yeah.\n\n97\n00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is different, right?\n\n98\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.020\nLook at it.\nShow Mac space address dash table\n\n99\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.520\nis the one that you want.\n\n100\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.340\nAnd once you've pressed that,\n\n101\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.870\nthat is where we start seeing\nsome information, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.890\nIn this Mac address table,\nremember that this is in RAM.\n\n103\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.940\nAnd you'll see quite a bit of\ninformation going across here.\n\n104\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.480\nLet me zoom in since it's\nactually a little bit more.\n\n105\n00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.360\nCondensed over here so that we can see it.\n\n106\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.230\nI'll have to zoom out\nin a little bit here.\n\n107\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.000\nBut this will help us out, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.540\nThere's VLAN information, which we\nhaven't gotten into yet but we will.\n\n109\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.650\nThere's MAC address, which is really\nthe information that we're looking for\n\n110\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.710\na lot of times.\n\n111\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.250\nAnd then we'll see two types generally.\n\n112\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.350\nWe'll see the idea of static and\nwe'll see also dynamic here.\n\n113\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.320\nIn this type, too, okay?\n\n114\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.690\nAnd then we have ports.\n\n115\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.550\nAnd notice that this one all says CPU.\n\n116\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.120\nNow when you start seeing this\nwhere it says STATIC and CPU, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.680\nThat normally indicates that either\nsomeone has actually already\n\n118\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.740\ntyped this in or\nit means it's part of the machine itself.\n\n119\n00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.920\nSo these are not the ones.\n\n120\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.800\nIf they're coming from the CPU, these\nare part of the actual switch itself,\n\n121\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.780\nwhich you and I are not gonna be able\nto change, modify or configure or\n\n122\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.660\ndo anything else to.\n\n123\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.350\nAnd you'll see at the very last one here,\nokay.\n\n124\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.950\nIt even includes that broadcast that\nwe talked about, which is now all f's,\n\n125\n00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.490\nand you see it's static, and\nit's also of course by the CPU.\n\n126\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.120\nNow notice that it begins to show us\nhow that Mac address table is built.\n\n127\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:29.260\nFrom fa1/0/22 okay, you're now actually\nseeing Well now the term dynamic.\n\n128\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.120\nSo someone plugged a cable into FA1/0/22,\nand\n\n129\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:43.120\nit learned dynamically, this MAC address\nthat was off of that particular port,\n\n130\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.490\nwhich is this one, the 005056866D0B.\n\n131\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.620\nSo it learned this and it went away and\nlinked it to this one port number.\n\n132\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.390\nThe other thing that it did, it also\nassigned that particular Mac address and\n\n133\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.240\nthis linking to a VLAN called VLAN 1.\n\n134\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.110\nAnd that's what all of them are gonna\nend being by default when they first get\n\n135\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.720\nconnected If you don't have\nany other VLAN's on there.\n\n136\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.390\nYou'll see of course even another one here\nthat also happens which is 04da.d232.4898.\n\n137\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.090\nOnce again dynamically learned and\noff of this same interface.\n\n138\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.600\nNow Daniel that's actually\npretty neat there.\n\n139\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.130\nWhere we actually did show you this in my\ndrawing that I did for simple diagrams,\n\n140\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:40.470\nwhen we ended up having two devices off of\none interface, is what we also saw there.\n\n141\n00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.608\nSo this one, you're actually\nseeing the very same thing,\n\n142\n00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:45.929\nthose two devices off of one interface,\nand\n\n143\n00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:50.090\nthen we have another device all by itself,\nwhich is right over here to, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.848\nNow, from the way that we caught up\nthis particular map address table,\n\n145\n00:07:54.848 --> 00:08:00.260\nyou see at the very end here where it says\ntotal Mac addresses for this criterion.\n\n146\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.933\nIt says 23, so this 1 in theory can hold\nup to 23 MAC addresses at one time based\n\n147\n00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:11.377\non the criteria, which would show all of\nwhat we can actually do at this point.\n\n148\n00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:13.519\nIt doesn't mean that's necessarily\njust the only limitation.\n\n149\n00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:17.270\nBut at this point, that's what it's seeing\nis what we're actually taking a look at.\n\n150\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.050\nSo when we start to see\nsomething like this,\n\n151\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.380\nyou'll actually see that on the switch and\nyou'll be able to tell.\n\n152\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.030\nMake sure you understand the difference\nhere when you see static and CPU.\n\n153\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.300\nThis means it was assigned by the device,\nand not something that we did.\n\n154\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.498\nBut when we plug something\ninto the port itself,\n\n155\n00:08:34.498 --> 00:08:38.556\nthat's when it begins to change and\nyou see the term dynamic.\n\n156\n00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:42.336\nAnd now you see the MAC address of\nthat device that was plugged in or\n\n157\n00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:44.900\nthe NIC of that device\nthat was plugged too.\n\n158\n00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.630\nSo let's see if we can\ndetermine this device here.\n\n159\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:54.183\nNow this core switch is supposed\nto be attached to NYACCESS1,\n\n160\n00:08:54.183 --> 00:08:56.395\nwhich is now still busy.\n\n161\n00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:58.610\nSo I'm not sure if we'll actually\nbe able to get to that one.\n\n162\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.768\nBut we'll see here in a moment of\nwhether or not we can get to that one or\n\n163\n00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:05.803\nif it's just gonna be busy\nevery time it needs to.\n\n164\n00:09:05.803 --> 00:09:12.819\nIn theory, this is supposed to\nshow up as one of these, right?\n\n165\n00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:13.940\nWhich is gonna be this FA1-0 here.\n\n166\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.210\nIt's supposed to show up\nas this one right here.\n\n167\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.850\nBut I can't get access to it because\nof this NYACCESS1 being busy.\n\n168\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.810\nLet's see what it shows us right now.\n\n169\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.119\nSo if I go to that device here, and\n\n170\n00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:30.998\nnow here's the device that's\nconnected to NYACCESS,\n\n171\n00:09:30.998 --> 00:09:36.462\nwhich is connected to NYCORE1 here,\nI should be able to do an ipconfig/ all.\n\n172\n00:09:38.508 --> 00:09:45.750\nAnd if I were to go to that\ndirectly attached switch,\n\n173\n00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:51.385\nThat should be what shows up right\nhere in the Physical Address.\n\n174\n00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:54.364\nRemember that Microsoft\ncalls it a Physical Address.\n\n175\n00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:56.010\nAnd that's clearly not the same one.\n\n176\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:01.075\nAnd that's because that NYACCESS1\nis actually clearly busy and\n\n177\n00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:05.043\nnow reporting something\nelse to what we saw there.\n\n178\n00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:05.916\nOr is it?\n\n179\n00:10:05.916 --> 00:10:09.358\nNope, see,\nthat one even begins with 7426 and\n\n180\n00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.330\nthis one itself is gonna be 05 something.\n\n181\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.703\nSo it's not really ready\nto show us anything.\n\n182\n00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:20.512\nBut it is actually reporting something\nelse that is directly recorded off of that\n\n183\n00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:23.555\ndevice is what we're seeing, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:27.145\nAll right, so since that device is not\nactually showing up, it means we'll have\n\n185\n00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:30.535\nto kinda change our strategy here\nof what we were gonna show next.\n\n186\n00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:31.615\n&gt;&gt; We're agile, Ronnie.\n\n187\n00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:33.105\n&gt;&gt; We are a little bit agile here.\n\n188\n00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:36.035\nSo we're gonna go on and\nshow you the difference now.\n\n189\n00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:40.610\nSo even though the switch does give us\nthis idea of the MAC address table,\n\n190\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.435\nwe also want to show you what\na MAC address table looks like and\n\n191\n00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:46.253\nwhat router as well, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:46.253 --> 00:10:50.303\nAnd I can also show you one on\na regular device such as the PC too.\n\n193\n00:10:50.303 --> 00:10:54.880\nSo before I do that, since I was down,\nlet me go back over here.\n\n194\n00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.060\nRemember that even your regular\nPC has a MAC address table.\n\n195\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.581\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n196\n00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:01.296\nI think your adapter is actually\nshowing up in your MAC address\n\n197\n00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:02.031\ntable.\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n\n198\n00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:03.994\nIt's just in port 22.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n199\n00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:05.603\nthen I'm lying to you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:06.224\n&gt;&gt; Did it actually\n\n201\n00:11:06.224 --> 00:11:06.777\nshow up?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n202\n00:11:06.777 --> 00:11:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I wasn't sure.\n\n203\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.538\nI was gonna say I thought it was supposed\nto be on 0/1, buf if it's there,\n\n204\n00:11:10.538 --> 00:11:11.287\nthat's great.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n205\n00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:14.876\nit's 63 something.\n&gt;&gt; You are the man cuz I was not-\n\n206\n00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:15.890\n&gt;&gt; I happened to just check it out.\n\n207\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.025\nThere it is, 60-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is, sure enough.\n\n208\n00:11:18.025 --> 00:11:19.782\nThat is actually the right one.\n\n209\n00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:21.670\nAnd it is showing up right here,\nso that's good.\n\n210\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.573\nI don't know how it's doing\nthat since that switched.\n\n211\n00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:24.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:11:24.238 --> 00:11:25.559\n&gt;&gt; So this must've actually been\n\n213\n00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.351\nconfigured a little bit before when\nthey turned this thing off and\n\n214\n00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:29.580\nallowed it to come through.\n\n215\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.750\nSo it is showing up\nthe way that it needs to,\n\n216\n00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.180\njust not on the port I was expecting it to\nshow up on, which is great as well, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.400\nSo let's go back and\nverify something else.\n\n218\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.300\nEvery device that's gonna connect to\nyour network is gonna have a MAC address\n\n219\n00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.070\ntable at some point when you do this.\n\n220\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.886\nAnd let me zoom back out here and on this.\n\n221\n00:11:50.886 --> 00:11:53.370\nI gotta go all the way down to 100%,\ndon't I?\n\n222\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.750\nSure do.\nIt won't show me that taskbar until I get\n\n223\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.631\nright down here at 100%.\n\n224\n00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:02.150\nDon't know why, it's just the way it is.\n\n225\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.699\nSo now, if I type in arp -a,\nwhich means show it all,\n\n226\n00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:17.600\nyou can now see where on this machine,\nthat's exactly what it's looking for.\n\n227\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.054\nSo now, you're actually seeing the IP\naddresses and, of course, MAC addresses.\n\n228\n00:12:21.054 --> 00:12:25.005\nAnd this one even dynamically learned\none as well, which is right here and\n\n229\n00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:25.970\nI can't mark it.\n\n230\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.951\nHold on one sec.\n\n231\n00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.640\nNow I could mark it, and there we go.\n\n232\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.880\nSo you can see where it's\ndynamically learning some.\n\n233\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.672\nAnd then, of course, the statics are the\nones that the machine has brought up or\n\n234\n00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:37.560\nthey're special ones.\n\n235\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:44.000\nSo here is the multicast addresses\nthat are put in here too.\n\n236\n00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.860\nAnd here, of course, is the broadcasters.\n\n237\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.478\nNow it's actually working by defualt,\nlook at that.\n\n238\n00:12:47.478 --> 00:12:52.790\nKinda neat, and then there's another\ninterface, which is this one.\n\n239\n00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.527\nWhich I'm assuming is what is also\nplugged in to that switch too where it's\n\n240\n00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:02.279\nactually got a different IP address,\neven right there, see that as well.\n\n241\n00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:06.790\nSo there's a 16.10, and then there's\na 0.1 address that's plugged in.\n\n242\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.810\nSo that has, of course,\nyour ability to see a MAC address.\n\n243\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.300\nAnd then, let me zoom back in,\nand let's go to NY1 so\n\n244\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.165\nthat we can see this one here.\n\n245\n00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.250\nAll right, so\n\n246\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.220\non a router, how does it\nactually look any different here?\n\n247\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:35.650\nIf I go back in, I can now do a show,\nMAC address table, if I can spell table.\n\n248\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.875\nOops, now this one is just not.\n\n249\n00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:43.770\nActually, I'm gonna do it\ndifferently here on this one.\n\n250\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:49.670\nLet's do show ip interface brief first.\n\n251\n00:13:52.868 --> 00:13:55.415\nAnd so the first thing that we're\nactually identifying, of course,\n\n252\n00:13:55.415 --> 00:13:56.650\nare all the addresses.\n\n253\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.720\nAnd this one's not gonna show up on\nanything because every single port\n\n254\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.990\nis administratively down.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.920\n&gt;&gt; Is what we're actually seeing here.\n\n256\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.140\nSo let's go ahead and activate 0/0.\n\n257\n00:14:09.405 --> 00:14:11.728\nInterface gigabit.\n\n258\n00:14:11.728 --> 00:14:18.790\nEthernet 0/0.\n\n259\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.400\nI have to spell interface, right, don't I?\n&gt;&gt; It does help.\n\n260\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Interface gigabit ethernet 0/0.\n\n261\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.290\nAnd I know what they're trying\nto do here on this interface.\n\n262\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.860\nThey're trying to force you\nto type in the whole command.\n\n263\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.576\nBut it does slow things down.\n\n264\n00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:36.961\nBecause on a real switch,\nyou just hit an up arrow,\n\n265\n00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:40.440\nyou go to the place where you\nmisspelled it and you just replace it.\n\n266\n00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.280\nBut here, they're trying to make\nyou type it in all the time.\n\n267\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.360\nSo that's what you have access to,\nand then a no shutdown.\n\n268\n00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.039\nI know it's for the good of everybody.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n269\n00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:51.779\n&gt;&gt; So I'm trying to be good and\n\n270\n00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:56.840\nnot use abbreviations as well to ensure\nthat we get what we need to, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.650\nSo now that the interface is activated,\nwe should see, of course,\n\n272\n00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.890\nsome syslog messages telling that\nit's actually up and ready to go.\n\n273\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.790\nAnd that is actually there.\n\n274\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.630\nSo on this interface,\nit is now going to connect and\n\n275\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.970\nwe are going back to NYCORE1 so\n\n276\n00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:19.250\nthat we can see whether or\nnot it learned a new MAC address there.\n\n277\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.829\nSo we're just turning this one on.\n\n278\n00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:26.290\nLet me see if I can scroll through here.\n\n279\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.640\nSo now we saw where 0 slash,\nokay, two is now turned on.\n\n280\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.479\nSo now with the information showing up,\nNYCORE1,\n\n281\n00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:42.290\nI should be able to find the MAC\naddress here, if I can get it to go.\n\n282\n00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.670\nMAC address- Table.\n\n283\n00:15:50.497 --> 00:15:54.362\nNow let me press down.\n\n284\n00:15:54.362 --> 00:16:00.461\nAnd so this is going to be,\nit's supposed to be here The IP address,\n\n285\n00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:05.704\nnot the IP address,\nthe Mac address gives me of that second\n\n286\n00:16:05.704 --> 00:16:10.418\ninterface on for us here,\nor 0 slash 0 on NYwin1.\n\n287\n00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:16.706\nSo if I see 7426AC,\nactually 8AD0 is what I'm looking for\n\n288\n00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:22.798\nWe go back here and we take a look and\n\n289\n00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:26.445\nwe do on ny, let's do this.\n\n290\n00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:31.694\nShow interface gigabit\n\n291\n00:16:31.694 --> 00:16:36.683\nEthernet slash zero.\n\n292\n00:16:36.683 --> 00:16:38.749\nGive it a moment here.\n\n293\n00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:40.640\nThen we scroll up.\n\n294\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.240\nAnd there it is, 88D0 here.\n\n295\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.776\nThat will also, of course show you,\nthere is the Mac address.\n\n296\n00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:51.260\nAnd so the NY Core One is actually\nshowing the learning state,\n\n297\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.810\nthat I was able to learn it.\n\n298\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.074\nAnd it happened so\nquickly the majority of the time,\n\n299\n00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:57.038\nwe don't have to worry\nabout explaining it.\n\n300\n00:16:57.038 --> 00:17:01.158\nIt's pretty much the one that takes\nthe longest time to be able to do once we\n\n301\n00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:02.830\nget to that point.\n\n302\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.385\nSo now that we've got everything set and\nwe're seeing the learning process,\n\n303\n00:17:07.385 --> 00:17:11.802\nthat is pretty much just about all that\nwe have to do to show the information is\n\n304\n00:17:11.802 --> 00:17:13.196\nbeing learned as well.\n\n305\n00:17:13.196 --> 00:17:16.285\nNow the second thing that\nwe want to take a look at,\n\n306\n00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:20.497\nis this idea of the aging timer Is\nwhat we're also looking at, too.\n\n307\n00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:23.189\nSo on NYCore1, let's go ahead and\n\n308\n00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:27.601\nset this one to a different aging time so\nthat we can see it.\n\n309\n00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:28.754\nBut no one's staying here for\n\n310\n00:17:28.754 --> 00:17:31.579\nfive minutes just looking at cuz\nthat's listed the five times.\n\n311\n00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:35.452\nSo we're going to change this right here.\n\n312\n00:17:35.452 --> 00:17:37.942\nLet me get into the global configuration.\n\n313\n00:17:43.107 --> 00:17:46.170\nOkay, yeah just,\nI was like I thought I saw the word error.\n\n314\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:52.337\nThen I want mac address-table,\n\n315\n00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:56.747\nand then aging-time.\n\n316\n00:17:56.747 --> 00:18:01.093\nAll right, remember that if you're\nnot exactly sure about this,\n\n317\n00:18:01.093 --> 00:18:06.160\njust go ahead and type in the, oops,\nwhich I forgot the keyword here, show.\n\n318\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.322\nAnd at the end, do a question mark, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:14.355\nTo be able to, that's because I'm,\nwanna know something,\n\n320\n00:18:14.355 --> 00:18:16.810\nlet me get back and let me do that again.\n\n321\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.511\nI don't even need to show,\nI just need Mac address table,\n\n322\n00:18:20.511 --> 00:18:23.318\ncuz I was trying to do\ntwo things at one time.\n\n323\n00:18:23.318 --> 00:18:24.610\nNow let's do the question mark.\n\n324\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.712\nAnd what we're looking for,\nof course, is the help.\n\n325\n00:18:28.712 --> 00:18:32.270\nAnd this is how we are gonna\nadjust the aging time here.\n\n326\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.151\nOn the exam, you will be able\nto use the question mark but\n\n327\n00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:39.793\ndo not expect to see everything\nthat is listed here.\n\n328\n00:18:39.793 --> 00:18:44.380\nMost of the time, they will only give\nyou maybe a sampling of what you'll see,\n\n329\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.180\njust to see if you know which of these\nare actually gonna be the valid one.\n\n330\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.578\nSo they'll let you configure\nany of them that they show you.\n\n331\n00:18:51.578 --> 00:18:53.873\nBut more common is something like this,\nright?\n\n332\n00:18:53.873 --> 00:18:58.076\nWhere they'll show you aging time and\nthen learning or static here,\n\n333\n00:18:58.076 --> 00:19:02.990\njust to see if you know which one will\nhelp you to adjust the aging time.\n\n334\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.777\nAnd at that point after that,\nif you try and\n\n335\n00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:09.814\ndo the help again after entering\naging time, it may not work.\n\n336\n00:19:09.814 --> 00:19:11.737\nIt may not do anything like that.\n\n337\n00:19:11.737 --> 00:19:14.440\nSo let's do it one more time here.\n\n338\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.753\nMac address-table, and this time aging,\n\n339\n00:19:19.753 --> 00:19:27.947\naging-time, and we are gonna\nset this to 10, for 10 seconds.\n\n340\n00:19:27.947 --> 00:19:31.250\nAlso remember that too it's actually\ndone in seconds not in minutes.\n\n341\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.656\nSo remember the default is 300 seconds,\nwhich is normally five minutes long.\n\n342\n00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:39.100\nWe are now gonna set this\nto 10 seconds instead.\n\n343\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:46.064\nAnd now that we're doing that we\nshould now be able to show MAC, oops.\n\n344\n00:19:46.064 --> 00:19:48.828\nI gotta get out of the interface there.\n\n345\n00:19:48.828 --> 00:19:53.540\nShow MAC address -table.\n\n346\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.111\nRemember that the aging time only affects\nthose that are dynamically learned,\n\n347\n00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:01.804\nit's not gonna affect those\nthat's gonna be statically here.\n\n348\n00:20:01.804 --> 00:20:07.080\nSo it's gonna be MAC address table,\ndynamic is what we should see.\n\n349\n00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.406\nPress Enter.\n\n350\n00:20:10.406 --> 00:20:12.050\nAnd now you'll see, there it is.\n\n351\n00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.383\nIt only took a look at the just\ndifferent dynamic ones that we see.\n\n352\n00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:17.700\nAnd then a moment here.\n\n353\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.062\nIf we hit it again,\nwe should see if we can do this.\n\n354\n00:20:22.062 --> 00:20:23.757\nSo it's gonna make me type it in again.\n\n355\n00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:33.504\nShow Mac address- table dynamic.\n\n356\n00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:42.980\nNow notice that it did age something out,\nbecause we only see three entries in here.\n\n357\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.846\nBut once it did and another device\ncame along and started talking again,\n\n358\n00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:52.472\nwhich is gonna be whatever was\nthe other one on that same fa0/22,\n\n359\n00:20:52.472 --> 00:20:55.129\nit came back up and it learned it again.\n\n360\n00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:59.450\nSo it aged it out at the very beginning\nhere when it didn't hear anything.\n\n361\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.762\nAnd now the switch itself or that device\nstarted to realize something it wasn't\n\n362\n00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:10.091\nconnecting to, it sent some ping or\nsomething ended up going across that line.\n\n363\n00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:13.199\nIt sent something that actually\nalerted it and it came back and\n\n364\n00:21:13.199 --> 00:21:15.008\nit allowed it to come right back in.\n\n365\n00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:19.069\nSo it doesn't have to wait any time\nto come back in, but it does actually\n\n366\n00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:23.620\nin that 10 seconds here allow you to\nage it out and then bring it back in.\n\n367\n00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.637\nMost of the time we don't adjust this.\n\n368\n00:21:26.637 --> 00:21:30.265\nI haven't ever had to adjust it in\nreal life as far as I know, but\n\n369\n00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:34.321\nit doesn't mean that there aren't\noccasions that you might have to.\n\n370\n00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:38.180\nBut on this one it's just strictly for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n371\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.942\nAnd if anything, you might test\nyour own switch out on this.\n\n372\n00:21:40.942 --> 00:21:44.928\nBut just make sure you put it back\nto the regular one that it was.\n\n373\n00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:48.689\nGetting it to actually do this right\nevery 10 seconds is putting a strain on\n\n374\n00:21:48.689 --> 00:21:49.232\nyour CPU.\n\n375\n00:21:49.232 --> 00:21:51.044\nAnd if you have a really busy network.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n376\n00:21:51.044 --> 00:21:52.500\n&gt;&gt; It's already running pretty hard.\n\n377\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.109\n&gt;&gt; I could see you might want to change\n\n378\n00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:57.386\nthe aging timer if you were doing\nsomething like connecting different\n\n379\n00:21:57.386 --> 00:21:58.618\ndevices to the same port.\n\n380\n00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:01.456\nYou're clicking something in,\nchecking it, and then unclicking it,\n\n381\n00:22:01.456 --> 00:22:03.700\nputting something else in\nthe same port and checking it.\n\n382\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.615\nYou want it to refresh a little faster\nthan waiting five minutes per, or\n\n383\n00:22:07.615 --> 00:22:10.038\nhaving to force it to\nupdate that MAC table.\n\n384\n00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:13.470\nSo maybe something like that,\nthat's just me grasping at straws.\n\n385\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no,\n\n386\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:19.098\nIt's very possible, like I said, a lot\nof time it is just for testing purposes.\n\n387\n00:22:19.098 --> 00:22:23.062\nI'm doing this and you want to actually\nverify that it's doing what you want to,\n\n388\n00:22:23.062 --> 00:22:24.122\nchanging it is fine.\n\n389\n00:22:24.122 --> 00:22:26.448\nIt's just changing it back you have to-\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget to do that.\n\n390\n00:22:26.448 --> 00:22:27.451\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget to\n\n391\n00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:29.312\nthat is the key because if not,\n\n392\n00:22:29.312 --> 00:22:34.370\nyou are gonna start putting on more of\na strain on your device itself, too.\n\n393\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.920\nRight, so now we're ready for our third\n\n394\n00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.883\nexercise here which is frame switching\nmethods and of course frame flooding.\n\n395\n00:22:41.883 --> 00:22:44.659\nWe wanna take a look at this idea too,\nokay?\n\n396\n00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:49.061\nWhen it comes down to frame switching\nthe exercise itself also subdivides\n\n397\n00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:53.090\nsomething that I didn't talk\nabout during our time in theory.\n\n398\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.644\nWhich is that there's two different\nmethods to actually forwarding data as it\n\n399\n00:22:57.644 --> 00:22:59.852\ncomes through a switch board, okay?\n\n400\n00:22:59.852 --> 00:23:04.572\nOn a switch board there's two methods\nthat really are kind of what's left and\n\n401\n00:23:04.572 --> 00:23:05.850\navailable.\n\n402\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:10.092\nThere's one called store and forward, and\nthe other one's called cutthroat, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:10.092 --> 00:23:14.876\nStore and forward, what it says is bring\nthe entire frame into that switchboard.\n\n404\n00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:18.464\nPut in its buffer, and\nthen once it's there,\n\n405\n00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:21.504\nforward it on to the destination port.\n\n406\n00:23:21.504 --> 00:23:26.199\nOkay, so it takes everything and it\nputs it into the buffer on that port and\n\n407\n00:23:26.199 --> 00:23:27.577\nthen forwards it on.\n\n408\n00:23:27.577 --> 00:23:30.953\nThat's probably what\nyou'll see most often, but\n\n409\n00:23:30.953 --> 00:23:34.573\nit is slower when it comes down to it,\nbut you see that.\n\n410\n00:23:34.573 --> 00:23:36.968\nAnd it's also the way to guarantee,\n\n411\n00:23:36.968 --> 00:23:40.532\nsometimes faster transmission\nspeeds in this sense.\n\n412\n00:23:40.532 --> 00:23:46.704\nIf it can actually intake the entire frame\ninto the buffer that's means the CRC and\n\n413\n00:23:46.704 --> 00:23:50.655\neverything has been checked,\neverything is good.\n\n414\n00:23:50.655 --> 00:23:54.526\nThat means then it knows that when it's\ntransmitting it's transmitting everything\n\n415\n00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:55.385\nthat it needs to and\n\n416\n00:23:55.385 --> 00:23:59.160\nthere's no need to actually worry about\nit kind of needing to be re-transmitted.\n\n417\n00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.450\nBut there's also something\ncalled cut through.\n\n418\n00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.799\nCut through says, just get me to\nthat point where I see source and\n\n419\n00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:08.210\ndestination MAC address\nin the frame header.\n\n420\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.880\nOnce I get that much,\nlet me just send it on through.\n\n421\n00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.990\nAnd the reason why is that, for\nhowever they figured this out, now Daniel,\n\n422\n00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.510\nI don't know how.\n\n423\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.600\nBut they look at billions of packets, and\n\n424\n00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.220\nwhat they realized is that if\nfragmentation happens with the frames,\n\n425\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.450\nit's within the first 48 bytes or\nsomething like that, or 64 bytes.\n\n426\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.615\nThat if it doesn't happen in that time,\nit's probably not gonna happen.\n\n427\n00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:35.159\nSo they're counting on statistical\nprobability that if we can get that much\n\n428\n00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:39.350\nin there, okay, then more than likely,\nit is not going to fragment.\n\n429\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.970\nIt's not gonna actually be any different,\nyou're not gonna have to retransmit.\n\n430\n00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.300\nBut there is always that theoretical\npossibility that it can happen.\n\n431\n00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.819\nSo cut through has, of course, been making\nits way through these switches because it\n\n432\n00:24:51.819 --> 00:24:53.906\nis much faster in what it does instead.\n\n433\n00:24:53.906 --> 00:24:58.122\nSo those are two different methods\nthat you can also end up seeing too.\n\n434\n00:24:58.122 --> 00:24:59.114\nMost of the time,\n\n435\n00:24:59.114 --> 00:25:04.130\nyou'll have to take a look at your switch\nbecause it is dependent upon the switch.\n\n436\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.280\nWhether or not it's actually cut\nthrough or whether it's store and fort.\n\n437\n00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.330\nIt's not a setting that you and\nI get to choose,\n\n438\n00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.699\nit's not a configuration that you and\nI get to choose.\n\n439\n00:25:11.699 --> 00:25:14.375\nIt's gonna be based on the device itself,\nand\n\n440\n00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:18.912\nwhat we tend to need there at that point\nin time for what's gonna be happening.\n\n441\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.480\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n442\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.630\ntake a look at some of the information\nthat we're looking for as well.\n\n443\n00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.370\nSo on NYCORE1, which is where we are,\nwhich is good,\n\n444\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:36.900\nwe're now going to make sure we take\na look at the interface of that FA0/22.\n\n445\n00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:43.601\nSo show interface fa,\nwhich is for fast Ethernet,\n\n446\n00:25:46.691 --> 00:25:52.150\nfastethernet 1/0/22, And\n\n447\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.730\nin just a moment, we'll be flooded\nwith a ton of information here, okay.\n\n448\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.459\nSo at this point, you'll see, of course,\neverything is up and is connected,\n\n449\n00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:04.360\nwhich is fine that is what we\nwere expecting to see, okay.\n\n450\n00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.680\nThe other thing that we're also\nlooking for is going to be, well,\n\n451\n00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.990\nright here in the queuing is what\nwe're also seeing as well, okay?\n\n452\n00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.900\nWhen you start taking a look\nat something like this,\n\n453\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:21.850\nnotice it tells you the size of the queue\nand the maximum size that you'll see.\n\n454\n00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.460\nSo in other words,\n\n455\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.210\nthis thing has queued up to about\n75 at one point if it needed to.\n\n456\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.360\nAnd then the total output drops, anything\nthat it dropped, it will also show up here\n\n457\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.160\nas well, that is a possibility\nwhen stuff happens, you see that.\n\n458\n00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.609\nAlso notice this queueing strategy,\nDaniel, FIFO,\n\n459\n00:26:37.609 --> 00:26:40.278\nyou remember what FIFO stands for?\n&gt;&gt; First in, first out.\n\n460\n00:26:40.278 --> 00:26:41.528\n&gt;&gt; First in, first out, so\n\n461\n00:26:41.528 --> 00:26:45.098\nit's not just trying to, it's not\njust making arbitrary decision and\n\n462\n00:26:45.098 --> 00:26:49.025\nsaying, look, if it comes in first,\nit's gonna go out first, okay?\n\n463\n00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:51.426\nSo there are gonna be different\nstrategies, once again,\n\n464\n00:26:51.426 --> 00:26:52.460\ndepending on your need.\n\n465\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.155\nAnd that's also where you select what\nswitch that you want to happen as well.\n\n466\n00:26:57.155 --> 00:27:02.115\nSo make sure you take a look at that,\nand then, oops, let me\n\n467\n00:27:02.115 --> 00:27:06.592\nsee if I click here and hit, not that.\n&gt;&gt; I hate when my doctor says that.\n\n468\n00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:07.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:08.778\n&gt;&gt; Oops, I wanna hit something;\n\n470\n00:27:08.778 --> 00:27:09.451\nnot that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n471\n00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:10.074\nnot that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n472\n00:27:10.074 --> 00:27:12.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that thing's slippery [LAUGH].\n\n473\n00:27:12.194 --> 00:27:14.293\n&gt;&gt; Man, do you still feel your legs?\n\n474\n00:27:14.293 --> 00:27:16.058\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you still feel that?\n\n475\n00:27:16.058 --> 00:27:20.410\n[LAUGH] Here it is, yeah, so the last one,\nof course, are failures, right, and\n\n476\n00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.444\nwhat we have here.\n\n477\n00:27:21.444 --> 00:27:23.473\nSo notice zero output buffer failures,\n\n478\n00:27:23.473 --> 00:27:26.640\nthese are also things that\nwe're looking for as well.\n\n479\n00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.030\nAre we starting to get some corruption in\nsome of the stuff that's going on here?\n\n480\n00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:34.510\nAnd this may indicate other issues that we\nare also facing when we start seeing this.\n\n481\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.340\nSo input queues, being able to\nactually take a look at the dropping,\n\n482\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.890\noutput queues, you name it.\n\n483\n00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.100\nThose are things that really do help\nus when we start talking about the idea\n\n484\n00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.110\nof forwarding.\n\n485\n00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.993\nBut understand just the basics here,\nwe're not getting\n\n486\n00:27:45.993 --> 00:27:49.840\na technical ideal of what storm four\nreally means, and also cut through.\n\n487\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.738\nI just give you the basics,\n\n488\n00:27:50.738 --> 00:27:53.070\nthat's probably what you'll\nneed to know and understand.\n\n489\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.100\nMost of us are never gonna get that far\nwhere we're taking apart the switch and\n\n490\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.776\ngo, ooh, look at that,\nthat one trace is broken.\n\n491\n00:27:59.776 --> 00:28:04.635\nCan you do it, yes, people do it all the\ntime, but we're not getting to that point.\n\n492\n00:28:04.635 --> 00:28:09.639\nAll right, so now we're gonna take\na look at frame flooding as well, okay?\n\n493\n00:28:09.639 --> 00:28:16.163\nSo on the frame flooding here,\nthe way that they have us showing this and\n\n494\n00:28:16.163 --> 00:28:20.948\nseeing this is gonna be\nusing one more command here,\n\n495\n00:28:20.948 --> 00:28:25.543\nwhich is gonna be show\nmac address -table count.\n\n496\n00:28:27.641 --> 00:28:31.868\nOkay, now, we're never gonna flood\nthis thing [LAUGH], because, and\n\n497\n00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:33.712\nyou'll take a look at it here.\n\n498\n00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:40.509\nI'd have to send 5,992 more [LAUGH]\ndevices to be able to flood it,\n\n499\n00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:45.910\nsince I already have four\nthat are statically here.\n\n500\n00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.070\nBut you can kind of guess here that\nthis is another possibility as you\n\n501\n00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.300\nstart seeing this.\n\n502\n00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.060\nSo on this one here,\nit does show you the possibility that it\n\n503\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.290\ncan flood out of everything\nthat it needs to as well.\n\n504\n00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.660\nAnd that's all you're doing is\nyou're actually counting and\n\n505\n00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.170\nseeing if everything\nelse is actually needed.\n\n506\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.340\nTo be able to find the existing\nones that you have out there, okay?\n\n507\n00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.390\nSo in the end,\nif you were to flood everything,\n\n508\n00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:14.280\nyou would have that many possible MAC\naddresses that would actually be there.\n\n509\n00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.925\nBut we do not have that many MAC addresses\nto be able to flood this as well,\n\n510\n00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:20.687\nbut it can happen, right.\n\n511\n00:29:20.687 --> 00:29:25.660\nThis is an attack,\na MAC address flooding, MAC flooding,\n\n512\n00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.868\nis that what?\n&gt;&gt; It's I think MAC flooding, yeah.\n\n513\n00:29:27.868 --> 00:29:28.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can't remember.\n\n514\n00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.384\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n515\n00:29:29.384 --> 00:29:31.736\n&gt;&gt; I always think of ARP, the ARP attack,\n\n516\n00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:35.473\nyeah, I don't know why I can't remember.\n&gt;&gt; It's ARP MAC flooding.\n\n517\n00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:36.205\n&gt;&gt; ARP MAC flooding.\n\n518\n00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:37.975\n&gt;&gt; No I don't [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:39.196\n&gt;&gt; I always get the names confused cuz I\n\n520\n00:29:39.196 --> 00:29:40.161\ncan't remember.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n521\n00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:43.494\ncuz they're all around the same protocol,\nand they kinda do the same thing.\n\n522\n00:29:43.494 --> 00:29:44.946\n&gt;&gt; But that can happen, right,\n\n523\n00:29:44.946 --> 00:29:47.791\nand that's something that you\ndo need to be aware of when it\n\n524\n00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:49.840\ncomes down to dealing with switches too.\n\n525\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.345\nWhen we get into the management section,\nwe'll talk about how we secure\n\n526\n00:29:53.345 --> 00:29:57.323\nour switches a little bit better to ensure\nthat we don't have to worry about this.\n\n527\n00:29:57.323 --> 00:29:59.263\nSo that's kind of\nthe very beginnings here,\n\n528\n00:29:59.263 --> 00:30:04.198\nwhen we start taking a look here.\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you start with that,\n\n529\n00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:06.912\nshow mac address-table.\n\n530\n00:30:06.912 --> 00:30:10.371\nAnd then from that point, look at\nthe information that it's showing you.\n\n531\n00:30:10.371 --> 00:30:13.744\nAnd then of course be able\nto go through that lab, and\n\n532\n00:30:13.744 --> 00:30:17.204\ntake a look at how it learned it,\nuse the aging timer.\n\n533\n00:30:17.204 --> 00:30:21.668\nRemember, the default is 300 seconds here,\nand that you can set that thing back.\n\n534\n00:30:21.668 --> 00:30:23.860\nAnd when I turn this lab off,\nit'll reset and\n\n535\n00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.640\neverything will go back into\nplace in the way it needs to.\n\n536\n00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.050\nBut these are some of the basic concepts,\nright.\n\n537\n00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.352\nThe theory is the important part at\nthis point of what we're talking about.\n\n538\n00:30:33.352 --> 00:30:34.790\nWe're gonna be working more and\n\n539\n00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.498\nmore with switches, we've still got\ninterfaces that we need to configure.\n\n540\n00:30:38.498 --> 00:30:41.400\nWe've still got VLANs that\nwe need to configure,\n\n541\n00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.590\nwe've still got multiple switches\nthat we need to configure.\n\n542\n00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.770\nSo we're not completely\ndone with switching yet,\n\n543\n00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.950\nthere's still a lot of information for\nus to go.\n\n544\n00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:50.905\nAt least at this point,\n\n545\n00:30:50.905 --> 00:30:54.600\nit'll give you the basics of any\ntheory we have talked about so far.\n\n546\n00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.650\nSo Daniel, that should actually be\na pretty good stopping point for us before\n\n547\n00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.810\nwe proceed on with more on switching.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n548\n00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.460\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today and\nteaching us what we need to know\n\n549\n00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.660\nto get that foundational knowledge\nwhen it comes to our switches.\n\n550\n00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.070\nBut like you alluded to,\nwe are out of time for this episode, so\n\n551\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.140\nwe're gonna call it quits.\n\n552\n00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.230\nAs for the rest of the series, stay tuned\nfor that, thanks for joining us, everyone.\n\n553\n00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.815\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n554\n00:31:16.815 --> 00:31:17.745\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:28.150\nRonnie Wong.\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.730\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It is going fine, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.400\nI wish I did coin that term.\n\n13\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.435\nThat'd be awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.370\n[LAUGH] But nope, I did not,\n\n15\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.790\nbut we are ready to continue\non though with Cisco CCENT.\n\n16\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.520\nAnd today we are jumping into\nthe exciting topic here of\n\n17\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.200\ninterpreting Ethernet frame formats.\n\n18\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.082\nI know, Daniel, you could not have\nwished for a topic that would be so,\n\n19\n00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.504\nso much stuff you can have.\n&gt;&gt; The ticket price paid for\n\n20\n00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:53.944\nthe whole seat but I don't wanna\nleave the edge with this episode.\n\n21\n00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:54.863\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n22\n00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:58.560\nwe are taking a look of course at\nthe idea of the Ethernet frame.\n\n23\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.750\nSo this is one of the hard concepts for\npeople that are getting in to networking\n\n24\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.340\nto kind of think about here, especially\nwhen you working with Cisco equipment.\n\n25\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.441\nThe one thing that I kind of understood\nbut really didn't at the very\n\n26\n00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:17.830\nbeginning was I know that equipment\nlike switches and routers, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.252\nThey allow me to get\nwhatever is being set, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:26.784\nThe data payload through those\ndevices from one location to another.\n\n29\n00:01:26.784 --> 00:01:31.136\nBut I didn't get this idea that I've\nfinally started realizing, is that when it\n\n30\n00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:35.510\ncomes down to networking, we really\ndon't care what the payload is, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.430\nIt really is not the important\npart to what you and\n\n32\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.200\nI are going to be working\nwith a lot of times.\n\n33\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.689\nWhen we start dealing with the idea of\nmaking sure that data can be delivered\n\n34\n00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.549\nfrom one device to the next and then of\ncourse from the source to the destination.\n\n35\n00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.396\nWhat we are only concerned with though\nis actually that PDU information that's\n\n36\n00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.170\nnot involving the payload.\n\n37\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.460\nIn other words, all the header\ninformation that we will take and\n\n38\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.630\nlook at is what we normally\nare concerned about overall.\n\n39\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.610\nSo there is a lot more details in there,\nwhen you first get the idea that hey,\n\n40\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.820\nI just need to get from source to\ndestination, you kinda got it.\n\n41\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.270\nThat makes sense.\n\n42\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.800\nBut when you say you're not really\nconcerned about the payload,\n\n43\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.350\nit's not that we don't want it to get\nthere but the details that we pay\n\n44\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.920\nattention to, as networking professionals,\nis not really the payload itself.\n\n45\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.750\nIt's gonna be of course those\ndetails inside of the header\n\n46\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.430\ninformation that allows us to move the\ndata from one location to the other, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.246\nAnd that's why we are going in to take\na look at the idea of the Ethernet\n\n48\n00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:36.337\nframe itself.\n\n49\n00:02:36.337 --> 00:02:39.363\nAnd we need to understand\nthe breakdown of this for\n\n50\n00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:44.350\nthe exam as well as it helps us when we\nbegin to do a bit of troubleshooting.\n\n51\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.980\nWhen data doesn't get from one\nlocation to the other, we can also,\n\n52\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.850\nmaybe perhaps see where it breaks down and\n\n53\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.980\nwhat device it breaks down on and what\nwe have to do to get that there, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.880\nSo that is what we're focusing in on for\nat least this episode.\n\n55\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.380\nLet's take a look at my screen here,\nand this will help us to get started.\n\n56\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.275\nWhen we start today, we're really\ntaking a look at layer 2 information,\n\n57\n00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:12.783\nand remember that when it comes down\nto the way that networking with,\n\n58\n00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:15.053\neven though we used the OSI model.\n\n59\n00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:19.156\nWe have really focused on and\nactually kind of eliminated every other\n\n60\n00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.420\nnetworking model that's\nout there besides TCP/IP.\n\n61\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.884\nAnd then TCP/IP, there's only really\none layer 2 type of data that we use,\n\n62\n00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:31.601\nwhich is gonna be of course\nEthernet frames, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:33.292\nAnd so when we start doing this,\n\n64\n00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:37.270\nhere is the other terminology that\nyou want to know that by, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.860\nSo when you think layer\n2 of the OSI model and\n\n66\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.870\nyou think of course the idea of the data\nlink layer and the TCP/IP model.\n\n67\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.864\nWhen they ask you about this, you may\nalso hear the term Ethernet frame or\n\n68\n00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.511\nyou may also hear the term IEEE 802.3.\n\n69\n00:03:53.511 --> 00:03:57.072\nAnd you might even see different\nletters after that as well in different\n\n70\n00:03:57.072 --> 00:04:00.813\ncombinations because this thing has\nundergone revision over the years and\n\n71\n00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:02.100\nwhat you've seen then.\n\n72\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.350\nSo, all those are essentially\nequivalent when you start taking look.\n\n73\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.050\nBut you can see something like this.\n\n74\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.450\nBut do make sure you pay attention here,\nokay?\n\n75\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.640\nThat is,\nof course standardized from the IEEE.\n\n76\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.250\nThose electrical engineers that are also,\n\n77\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.070\nthey were the ones that came up\nwith the idea of the 802 standards.\n\n78\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.130\nAnd this is a strange\nformatting name here.\n\n79\n00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.740\nDaniel, on the idea of 802,\n\n80\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.120\nthis is where you kinda get\nan international flavor for things.\n\n81\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.360\nWhich I still don't understand\nto this day but it makes sense.\n\n82\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.320\nThe IEEE first met in February of 1980,\nokay?\n\n83\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.372\nSo, instead of doing something like\nthe IEEE first formed in February of 1980,\n\n84\n00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:49.725\nthey actually decided that\nit's going to be 80, okay 2.\n\n85\n00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:53.806\nThat actually stands for February,\nwhich is the number of the second month\n\n86\n00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:58.134\nof the year, and then 80, but I don't\nknow why they switched it backwards.\n\n87\n00:04:58.134 --> 00:04:59.536\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] the international format or\n\n88\n00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:00.426\n[INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n89\n00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:04.556\nlike it's gotta be something like,\nthis is the way we can do this and\n\n90\n00:05:04.556 --> 00:05:08.710\nit honors that initial date of\nwhen the IEEE first formatted.\n\n91\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.460\nThen, numbers after the dot here\nrepresents different committees\n\n92\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.050\nthat you'll end up seeing\nregarding different technologies.\n\n93\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.570\nThey don't govern it so much as much as\nthey publish different standards for it,\n\n94\n00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.650\nand say, here's what we believe\nis the standardization.\n\n95\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.750\nAnd on that standardization you can either\nadopt it, or you don't have to adopt it.\n\n96\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.405\nBut the idea of adopting it right, means\nthat it would end up being able to have\n\n97\n00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:37.150\ninteroperability with other companies and\ntheir particular products.\n\n98\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.820\nThat will also interact with that as\nwell and shouldn't cause a problem.\n\n99\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.640\nSo that's why you see\nthe idea of 802.3 and\n\n100\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.560\nthen you wanna of course understand\nthat the technology that we're really\n\n101\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.110\ndealing with of course is gonna be\nEthernet and frames in particular.\n\n102\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.745\nEthernet involves of course layer 1 and\nlayer 2 technology.\n\n103\n00:05:55.745 --> 00:06:00.879\nWe specify the type of cabling in Ethernet\nas well as the idea of the frame and\n\n104\n00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:06.192\nEthernet as well and that all falls\nunderneath that standard of 802.3.\n\n105\n00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:08.877\nJust when you go, well Ronnie you're\nemphasizing that number pretty hard there.\n\n106\n00:06:08.877 --> 00:06:09.819\n&gt;&gt; 802.3, is that the number Ronnie?\n\n107\n00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.901\n&gt;&gt; 802.3, yeah that is the number.\n\n108\n00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.705\n[LAUGH] But it's really important.\n\n109\n00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:16.725\nIt's easy to overlook and\njust not think about it again.\n\n110\n00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:20.235\nBut just remember that all this\ndoes actually fall underneath that.\n\n111\n00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:24.525\nBecause if not, right, you'd actually\nhave different types of layer 2\n\n112\n00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:27.170\ninformation that we would\nall end up looking at.\n\n113\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.010\nAnd all that stuff changes.\n\n114\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.456\nSo for example,\nwhen I first got my CCNA right,\n\n115\n00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:36.800\nthe big layer 2 technology wasn't\njust this in the LAN side, but\n\n116\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.704\nit's actually in the WAN side of things,\nwhich was frame relay.\n\n117\n00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:44.620\nOn frame relay, the layer 2 technology is\nnot an Ethernet frame, it's a DLCI, or\n\n118\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.750\na DLCI, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.540\nData Link Connection Interface,\nI can't remember, or DCLI.\n\n120\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.253\nIt's been so long.\n&gt;&gt; It's been so long.\n\n121\n00:06:54.253 --> 00:06:55.270\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember which one is.\n\n122\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.250\nBut this is actually the same thing, but\n\n123\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.790\nit's replacing what we would see\ninside of LAN, using that other,\n\n124\n00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.680\nthe idea of the DLCI number is\nwhat we would actually do instead.\n\n125\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.150\nSo, you would see that, but today\neverything has kind of been reduced down.\n\n126\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.950\nAnd because we're using TCP/IP,\nit's all gonna be here.\n\n127\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.850\nNow, when we take a look at\nthe layer 2 frame then, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.912\nWhen you see data and pad here,\nall of that information for\n\n129\n00:07:19.912 --> 00:07:25.023\nus right here really represents layer\n3 and above and we'll get to that.\n\n130\n00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:28.899\nBut the rest of this, frame check\nsequence, see FCS over here, and\n\n131\n00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:32.440\nall this other information\nthat we see around here.\n\n132\n00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.370\nAll that is all layer 2, or Ethernet\nframe headers, it is what we're seeing.\n\n133\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.604\nSo beginning with the preamble,\nSOF stands for Start of Frame.\n\n134\n00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:44.880\nAnd then of course we have the destination\nMAC address, destination source address.\n\n135\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.280\nAnd then you have length or type.\n\n136\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.550\nYou can't be both at the same time.\n\n137\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.484\nBut that's what we're generally\nending up seeing here, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:52.484 --> 00:07:54.627\nNow for what's important for you and\n\n139\n00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:58.583\nme when we start to take the look\nat a lot of the information, right?\n\n140\n00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:03.006\nWhen you end up doing what we walked\nthrough in the OSI encapsulation process,\n\n141\n00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:05.754\nwhere we were talking\nabout the communication,\n\n142\n00:08:05.754 --> 00:08:10.310\nsending from one machine to the other,\nwell, this is what you see right here.\n\n143\n00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.895\nAnd the last step before\nit leaves a machine, okay,\n\n144\n00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:16.919\nit is that final step to\nmake it into a frame.\n\n145\n00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:21.833\nSo as layer three data and everything is\nput in, then before it gets put out onto\n\n146\n00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:26.984\nthe wire, this is where all of this extra\ninformation is also gonna be ready to go.\n\n147\n00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:31.676\nAnd the reason why this is important is\nbecause we cannot put that on to the wire,\n\n148\n00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:36.299\nit will be understood by any other device\nthat's connected to that wire or even\n\n149\n00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:41.390\nthrough routers or anything, if we don't\nhave this layer two information on there.\n\n150\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.340\nSo even if we were to put out\njust some signal out on the wire,\n\n151\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.248\nall those devices going,\n\n152\n00:08:45.248 --> 00:08:49.660\nwell I don't know where you're trying\nto go, there's no destination address.\n\n153\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.610\nThere's a voltage spike on the wire,\nbut I can't read any of it.\n\n154\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.450\nIt doesn't make sense to us.\n\n155\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.070\nSo that is the final step here.\n\n156\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.487\nOkay, it prepares the frame to\nbe transmitted from the NIC,\n\n157\n00:09:01.487 --> 00:09:03.167\nput out on to the wire.\n\n158\n00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:08.130\nNow, on the receiving side,\nif everything is on the wire,\n\n159\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.020\nat that point, with the Layer\ntwo frame information, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.620\nThis is where the destination\nNIC receives those bits, and\n\n161\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.610\nbegins that decapsulation process.\n\n162\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.965\nWhen it does that, it takes that frame\ncheck sequence, and it runs through that\n\n163\n00:09:22.965 --> 00:09:25.939\nmathematical problem that says hey,\nlet's take a look at this here.\n\n164\n00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:29.251\nEverything besides the preamble, okay,\n\n165\n00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:34.970\nbeginning with destination MAC source,\nas well as the data and pad here.\n\n166\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.000\nIt checks, it goes hey,\nhere's what you reported it being.\n\n167\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.950\nWhen I run it, is it the same thing?\n\n168\n00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.260\nIf it is, it begins that process\nof now processing through.\n\n169\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.420\nWe're moving that frame check sequence.\n\n170\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.842\nAnd then verifying,\nis this the right destination MAC,\n\n171\n00:09:49.842 --> 00:09:52.706\non this NIC that it's supposed to be on,\nokay?\n\n172\n00:09:52.706 --> 00:09:56.966\nIf it is, it just goes ahead and begins\nprocessing the rest of this frame header,\n\n173\n00:09:56.966 --> 00:09:59.549\nand then moves into layer\nthree on that machine.\n\n174\n00:09:59.549 --> 00:10:04.236\nAnd then it begins to process layer\nthree information, which is within here,\n\n175\n00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.450\nokay, so once it checks that,\nit verifies that too.\n\n176\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.870\nSo there's two possibilities\nthen that this frame\n\n177\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.160\nheader allows us to be able to do, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.774\nIf we start to put this\nout onto the wire and\n\n179\n00:10:16.774 --> 00:10:21.482\nit is actually the same as what the NIC\nsays, that here's my MAC address and\n\n180\n00:10:21.482 --> 00:10:25.478\nthe destination MAC reads the same,\nit would do that process.\n\n181\n00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:30.590\nBut if it's not,\nit will simply drop that packet.\n\n182\n00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.978\nSay, that's not for me, so\nI don't need to process this any further.\n\n183\n00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:36.516\nLet me go ahead and drop it,\nor filter it out, or\n\n184\n00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:40.570\nwhatever you want to call it,\nit never makes it to that machine.\n\n185\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.410\nSo even if we were to put this out onto a\nsingle broadcast domain, okay, this layer\n\n186\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:50.840\ntwo information, that means all of those\nother devices which the destination MAC\n\n187\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.000\naddress does the not match what's in the\ndestination what the NIC is on that one,\n\n188\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.840\nthose devices generally end up dropping\nall of that information as well, okay.\n\n189\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.730\nSo that's gonna be key.\n\n190\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.052\nNow, the other part of this we also\nwanna pay attention to, especially for\n\n191\n00:11:07.052 --> 00:11:11.646\nthe idea of the exam too is, look at the\nmaximum and the minimum frame size here,\n\n192\n00:11:11.646 --> 00:11:13.449\nis what we want to be able to do.\n\n193\n00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:17.550\nWhen you start taking a look at\nthe idea of the minimum frame size,\n\n194\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.875\nthe smallest size that a Ethernet\nframe could be is about 64 bytes,\n\n195\n00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:26.068\nwhich of course excludes the preamble and\nthe start of frame here.\n\n196\n00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:30.652\nNow we're gonna take a look at what\neach of these options actually means for\n\n197\n00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:35.470\nus, but that's what happens here,\nokay, pay attention to that 64 bytes.\n\n198\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:42.708\nNotice the maximum frame size though\nis somewhere around 1518 bytes.\n\n199\n00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:46.890\nNow the reason why I actually\nhave kind of a roundabout, right,\n\n200\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.468\ndepending on who you go to, but\nin Cisco land, it's 1518 bytes.\n\n201\n00:11:51.468 --> 00:11:55.825\nIf you were to go to a vendor-neutral\nlike CompTIA or something, and I'm\n\n202\n00:11:55.825 --> 00:12:00.837\nexplaining cuz you may have come from the\nNetwork+ world and you see the same thing.\n\n203\n00:12:00.837 --> 00:12:05.170\nAnd they'll tell you\nthe maximum frame size is 1526.\n\n204\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:10.169\nSo in Cisco, that's why I'm telling, cuz\nI don't want you to go, crap, but I just\n\n205\n00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:15.880\nlearned this in Network+ that it was 1526,\nand now Ronnie's saying, Cisco says 1518.\n\n206\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.520\nIt depends on the vendor and\nhow they choose to calculate this, and\n\n207\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.550\nthat's why it's a little bit different.\n\n208\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.800\nSo I'm saying around it because I\ndon't know what the true number is,\n\n209\n00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.810\neverybody will tell you Cisco says 1518.\n\n210\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.220\nBut is it really that or not?\n\n211\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.390\nWell, CompTia says it's 1526.\n\n212\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.790\nIs it really that?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n213\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.220\n&gt;&gt; I don't really know.\n\n214\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.108\nBut I will tell you that those\nare the ones that you'll generally\n\n215\n00:12:38.108 --> 00:12:39.027\nget confused here.\n\n216\n00:12:39.027 --> 00:12:42.121\nAnd if you happen to see those\nnumbers that's around that point,\n\n217\n00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:43.430\nthat's gonna be key.\n\n218\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.083\nNow for us though, this is kind\nof neat at this point too Daniel.\n\n219\n00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:49.076\nRemember that a few episodes ago and\n\n220\n00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:53.330\nI'll kind of show a reminder of this\nprobably in a little bit as well, okay,\n\n221\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.653\nis that when we saw some of\nthe information come through, if\n\n222\n00:12:56.653 --> 00:13:01.518\nyou've been following this in the series,\nwe actually did a show interface command.\n\n223\n00:13:01.518 --> 00:13:06.303\nAnd we saw some weird things,\nthings that called ruts and\n\n224\n00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:09.003\ngiants, I kept saying jumbos.\n\n225\n00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:14.455\nJumbos are there, but usually for\ndata storage devices, not really for this.\n\n226\n00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:18.880\nBut the idea of runts and giants,\nwell, what does that really mean?\n\n227\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.982\nWell, the minimum frame size right,\n64 bytes.\n\n228\n00:13:20.982 --> 00:13:23.287\nAnything under 64 bytes,\n\n229\n00:13:23.287 --> 00:13:28.590\nyou can now assume that's probably\nwhat they call a runt, okay.\n\n230\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.021\nWhich means hey look,\nI didn't get enough information here, but\n\n231\n00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:34.385\nwhat information wouldn't it have gotten?\n\n232\n00:13:34.385 --> 00:13:37.200\nWell think about it,\nit's probably missing what?\n\n233\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.210\nA MAC address?\n\n234\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.790\nMaybe that's probably what happened.\n\n235\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.845\nMore than likely the data is all there,\nbut it probably missing one of these two\n\n236\n00:13:43.845 --> 00:13:48.345\nMAC addresses or this frame check sequence\ndidn't matchup for one reason or another.\n\n237\n00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:50.050\nAnd it's saying hey look,\n\n238\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.780\nI can't get enough information\nin to verify any of this stuff.\n\n239\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:01.428\nThe other possibility though, okay,\nis right here at 1518 and above.\n\n240\n00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:06.030\nSo if you get something greater\nthan 1518 on the Cisco device,\n\n241\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.040\nwell that port registers it as a giant,\nwhich is saying, hey,\n\n242\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.450\nthis is outside of what the parameter\nthat we're expecting to see.\n\n243\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.163\nSo that means that there might\nbe extra information there, and\n\n244\n00:14:17.163 --> 00:14:18.299\nwe don't know what it is.\n\n245\n00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:22.650\nSo we're just marking it as\na possible error at this point.\n\n246\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.780\nNow can it deliver it?\n\n247\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.130\nIt can, but it doesn't mean that the\nreceiving device will actually accept it.\n\n248\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.200\nSo even if this goes, yeah,\nI'll let it pass through, but\n\n249\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.920\nit might be that the receiving\ndevice says, I don't accept giants.\n\n250\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.510\nDump it, just resend it, and\nresend it right this time instead.\n\n251\n00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.270\nSo you'll also end up seeing that too.\n\n252\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.480\nSo even though this device may\nkind of allow it to pass through,\n\n253\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.760\nit's not all the time.\n\n254\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.370\nBut you may see that as well, so\njust kind of a heads up pointer.\n\n255\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.938\nWhen you start wondering, what are those\ndifferent ones that are out there,\n\n256\n00:14:51.938 --> 00:14:53.136\nbut that's pretty much it, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:58.213\nAll right Daniel, so now, we need to break\nthis down and make sure that we understand\n\n258\n00:14:58.213 --> 00:15:02.933\nwhat these components are, and I marked\nthe ones that we normally talk about at\n\n259\n00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:07.967\nthis point in the different colors, to try\nand highlight them a little bit better.\n\n260\n00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:13.830\nBut would I wanna go ahead and\nlearn about the rest of them, yes, okay.\n\n261\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.040\nBecause it does help you\nto kinda put everything in\n\n262\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.470\nplace the way that you need to,\nand understand how the devices\n\n263\n00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.550\nactually do end up receiving the\ninformation and sending the information.\n\n264\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.370\nSo let's start from the left hand\nside to the right hand side, and\n\n265\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.668\nthen we'll continue on, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:29.668 --> 00:15:36.599\nThis 7 byte preamble, okay, remember it's\nnot 7 bits, 7 bytes, okay, is key here.\n\n267\n00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:42.106\n7 bytes preamble is all about\nthe synchronization of those machines and\n\n268\n00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:43.017\nthat data.\n\n269\n00:15:43.017 --> 00:15:47.660\nSo it again starts with this and\nit says, hey, are you ready?\n\n270\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.418\nHere is the information I'm sending,\nare you ready for that?\n\n271\n00:15:50.418 --> 00:15:52.838\nSo it takes about 7 bytes for\nit to go ahead and\n\n272\n00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:55.460\ndo everything that it\nneeds to in that preamble.\n\n273\n00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.933\nTo do all that stuff to verify that, hey\nboth sides are gonna be able to receive.\n\n274\n00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:04.030\nSend and receive this frame, we are off\nand we are ready to go here, okay.\n\n275\n00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.240\nSo that makes sense because it wants\nto make sure that the data get from one\n\n276\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.060\nlocation to the other and\nthat's what we have there.\n\n277\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.183\nNext with the SOF of Start Of Frame.\n\n278\n00:16:13.183 --> 00:16:19.048\nWell what this one is going to do is even\nthough it's a single byte of information,\n\n279\n00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:22.959\nit tells you what the layer\n2 header should be, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.384\nSo on the Start Of Frame,\nthe reason why this is important,\n\n281\n00:16:26.384 --> 00:16:29.845\neven though today we would\nconsider it dated a lot of times.\n\n282\n00:16:29.845 --> 00:16:34.410\nAt one point, remember we had more\nthan one real networking model,\n\n283\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.036\nvendor proprietary model, right?\n\n284\n00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:41.290\nWell, the Start Of Frame actually does\nsay hey, what's gonna be the next byte or\n\n285\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.140\nwhat are you expecting to see?\n\n286\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.710\nSo, it could be a MAC address, but\nit could be like what we're talking about,\n\n287\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.181\na could be anything.\n\n288\n00:16:48.181 --> 00:16:53.080\nBut in 802.3 it's saying hey look,\nIt's gonna be a MAC address.\n\n289\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.970\nThat's exactly what 802.3 is.\n&gt;&gt; It's making a hard and fast rule,\n\n290\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.260\nthis will be a MAC address.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.340\n&gt;&gt; A media access\n\n292\n00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.170\ncontroller.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n293\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.850\n&gt;&gt; And that's it.\n\n294\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.720\n&gt;&gt; That's just it.\n\n295\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.160\nAnd that's what we want to understand,\n\n296\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.220\ncuz most people go,\nwell yeah I see it's the next frame.\n\n297\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.650\nSo why is that important?\n\n298\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.800\nBecause at one time,\nit could've been any layer 2 address.\n\n299\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.010\nNot just the idea of a MAC address.\n\n300\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.240\nAnd it's just been there forever.\n\n301\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.320\nAnd it just got that way.\n\n302\n00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.777\nDestination MAC, of course,\nintended recipient of the frame,\n\n303\n00:17:21.777 --> 00:17:25.355\nokay, at the layer 2 of\ninformation that's on the NIC.\n\n304\n00:17:25.355 --> 00:17:28.505\nThat is what we're looking for\nis that MAC address here.\n\n305\n00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:31.535\nThe destination will be here and\nthen the source.\n\n306\n00:17:31.535 --> 00:17:34.585\nNow notice, Daniel, this is kind of a\nlittle bit backward from the way that you\n\n307\n00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:36.474\nand I logically-\n&gt;&gt; You would think about it, right?\n\n308\n00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:39.033\nYou would think,\nI wanna know what the source is first but\n\n309\n00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:41.325\nhere we got the destination\nbefore the source.\n\n310\n00:17:41.325 --> 00:17:44.281\nI guess it's more concerned about where\nit's going than where it came from.\n\n311\n00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:45.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to that point but\n\n312\n00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.980\nit's also the processing,\nthe way that it works, right?\n\n313\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.320\nSo as you send data out from that NIC,\n\n314\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.730\nthe first thing that should be received,\nright, is going to be that preamble.\n\n315\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.290\nHey, I want to send.\n\n316\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.410\nOkay well sure,\nlet me send you some information.\n\n317\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.470\nThe next thing you should receive\nis a destination MAC address.\n\n318\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.700\nOkay, I get that because it would be\nsilly to go, here's who it's from, and\n\n319\n00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.990\nthen here's who it's going to?\n\n320\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.715\nIt wants that receiving machine to go,\nthat's mine or let's drop it.\n\n321\n00:18:14.715 --> 00:18:16.240\nCuz if it drops it first, right,\n\n322\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.630\nit doesn't have to process any of\nthe rest of this information, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.230\nIf you just received the source,\nyou're already processing, what,\n\n324\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.330\nan extra 6 bytes.\n\n325\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.080\nBefore you can decide, am I gonna\ndrop it or I'm not gonna drop it.\n\n326\n00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.555\nSo this way it goes ahead and\nallows that processing of this.\n\n327\n00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:33.644\nSays yes that's mine or if it's not,\n\n328\n00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:36.859\nlet's just drop it here only\nafter receiving 14 bytes.\n\n329\n00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:41.817\nIt makes a lot of sense because it does\nsave a little bit of capacity in what\n\n330\n00:18:41.817 --> 00:18:43.040\nyou see.\n\n331\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.150\nAnd then of course identifying\nthe sender of the frame as well\n\n332\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.180\nis what we also see right here.\n\n333\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:55.160\nNow notice that you have this length or\ntype here, okay, and this is 2 bytes.\n\n334\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.350\nNow notice the way that I have this,\nit says defines the length of the data or\n\n335\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.210\ndefines the protocol in the frame.\n\n336\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.720\nNow what is that about?\n\n337\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.540\nWell there comes a point in time,\n\n338\n00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.840\nonce your particular frame\nhits around that 1518.\n\n339\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.330\nThat length size automatically\nturns into a type for us instead.\n\n340\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.390\nSo as long as it's under 1518,\nit will go ahead and\n\n341\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.390\nsay here's how much data you\nshould be expecting to see.\n\n342\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.846\nAnd then that should actually be\nbetween what we see right here,\n\n343\n00:19:27.846 --> 00:19:29.127\nwhich is 46 to 1500 bytes.\n\n344\n00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:33.573\nBut if it's greater than that 1500 or\naround 1518 it says,\n\n345\n00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:37.395\nhere's the type of data that\nyou're gonna see instead.\n\n346\n00:19:37.395 --> 00:19:41.730\nCuz it's already met that threshold of,\nactually, the length here.\n\n347\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.480\nSo it just defines what\nwe call the type of data,\n\n348\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.850\ninstead of the protocol is what\nwe're gonna see at that point.\n\n349\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.260\nSo, that's what you end up and for\nus, again, the protocol is ethernet.\n\n350\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.160\nThat's pretty much it, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.717\nThen of course there's data.\n\n352\n00:19:55.717 --> 00:19:59.855\nRemember that all the data means\nthe layer 3 PDU, which includes what?\n\n353\n00:19:59.855 --> 00:20:04.855\nThe layer 3 headers as well as layer 4,\nlayer 5, layer 6 and layer 7 headers.\n\n354\n00:20:04.855 --> 00:20:08.440\nAll that is now wrapped\nup in that layer 3 PDU.\n\n355\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.280\nAnd I made it smaller cuz everybody is\nall, that's shouldn't be that huge.\n\n356\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.966\nYes, if you are trying to do it\nin proper proportional size-\n\n357\n00:20:15.966 --> 00:20:17.124\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] There you go, proportions,\n\n358\n00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:18.703\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then this thing will be way\n\n359\n00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:20.777\nbigger than everything else here.\n&gt;&gt; You should've done\n\n360\n00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:21.410\nRonnie.\n&gt;&gt; I should\n\n361\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:21.960\nhave.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.849\n&gt;&gt; But to show you that everything is\n\n363\n00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:26.417\nencapsulated inside of\nlayer 3 we did that.\n\n364\n00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:29.370\nAnd then of course the idea\nof the Frame Check Sequence.\n\n365\n00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.290\nMake sure that everything is\nactually done here in the very end.\n\n366\n00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.490\nUsed by the destination NIC to check for\ntransmission errors.\n\n367\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.390\nSo in the very end,\n\n368\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.590\nwhen it does this, it now has that\nsame ability as what we reported.\n\n369\n00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.860\nWhen we send the data out right,\nit does the same math and\n\n370\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.150\nit puts the answer right here.\n\n371\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.720\nThe receiving computer now\nafter getting the data and\n\n372\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.510\nthe information that it needs,\nit runs the same mathematical check.\n\n373\n00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.818\nIf those match,\nwhatever it ran versus what's reported in\n\n374\n00:20:57.818 --> 00:21:02.450\nthe Frame Check Sequence, it knows\nthat that data packet has arrived.\n\n375\n00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.220\nNot missing any data or\nnot wrong in any sort.\n\n376\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.680\nSo for\nus it is actually a way to check for\n\n377\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.790\ntransmission errors that we\nsee going on right here, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.930\nNow all that stuff that you see right\nhere, every bit of it, okay, is important.\n\n379\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.480\nThe ones that I highlighted essentially in\ncolor, okay, those are probably the ones\n\n380\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.290\nyou'll see more often when it comes\ndown to studying for the exam, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.640\nSo it's only three of them,\nand you're like, Ronnie,\n\n382\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.380\nwhy did you make us go through all that?\n\n383\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.890\nBecause it's valuable information.\n\n384\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.940\nIf you don't understand it,\n\n385\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.970\nat some point in the future, you're\ngonna say well, does it really matter?\n\n386\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.370\nYes, because you can't define\nthis stuff correctly if\n\n387\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.780\nyou don't know about all this other stuff.\n\n388\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.120\nAnd all of it is made up on\nthe 802.3 frame here, okay?\n\n389\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.630\nSo they may ask you very\nsimple questions on the exam.\n\n390\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.160\nAnd again I can't tell you\nexactly what's on the exam.\n\n391\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.892\nBut I won't put it passed them\nto just say true or false, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:06.045\nIs length and\ntype a header inside of layer 2 on 802.3?\n\n393\n00:22:06.045 --> 00:22:09.510\nWell if you don't know, you don't know,\nokay, I can't make you know that.\n\n394\n00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.490\nI can show you that\nthe information is there.\n\n395\n00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:17.226\nDoes the Start Of Frame actually indicate\nthat there's a layer 2 destination\n\n396\n00:22:17.226 --> 00:22:18.195\naddress there?\n\n397\n00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:19.670\nOr it does it indicate\na specific MAC address?\n\n398\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.760\nNow, that brings us to a good point,\nespecially on exam tip, right?\n\n399\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.660\nDaniel, a layer 2 address,\nand a MAC address,\n\n400\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.547\nto me, they sound identical.\n&gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time seeing\n\n401\n00:22:30.547 --> 00:22:32.083\nthe difference there, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you and\n\n402\n00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:34.960\nI have a hard time seeing\nany difference in that.\n\n403\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.960\nBut on the exam, if you get, what if\nyou get both of those as an answer?\n\n404\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.812\nWouldn't you go,\n\n405\n00:22:40.812 --> 00:22:42.788\nthose are both right answers?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n406\n00:22:42.788 --> 00:22:44.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but when it comes down to\n\n407\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.570\nthe exam, you have to pick the one\nthat is gonna be the most right or\n\n408\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.452\nthe best, Daniel, you love the-\n\n409\n00:22:52.452 --> 00:22:52.995\n&gt;&gt; Man\n&gt;&gt; Best answers.\n\n410\n00:22:52.995 --> 00:22:55.404\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That makes me wanna get a pump sprayer\n\n411\n00:22:55.404 --> 00:22:57.849\nfull of diesel fuel and\nburn something down.\n\n412\n00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:00.240\nCuz you're right,\nboth answers are correct.\n\n413\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.740\nBut typically it'll ask you what is,\nin this type of area,\n\n414\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.890\nwhat is the most correct?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or best.\n\n415\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.798\n&gt;&gt; What is the best answer kind of thing.\n\n416\n00:23:07.798 --> 00:23:11.291\nAnd yeah, if you've been like well\nI'm good with it being a layer 2,\n\n417\n00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:14.030\nI know it's layer 2 so\nI'll just keep my mind on that.\n\n418\n00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.246\nAnd then they start asking you\nother things about layer 2 or\n\n419\n00:23:16.246 --> 00:23:17.802\nsomething that's similar.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n420\n00:23:17.802 --> 00:23:18.520\n&gt;&gt; And they're looking for more\n\n421\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.730\nspecific information, you wanna have that.\n\n422\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.150\nYou gotta remember,\n\n423\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:27.600\nCisco with their certifications\nfrom CCENT all the way to CCIE.\n\n424\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.080\nThey are meant to create people that\nare experts in networking field and\n\n425\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.550\nthey wanna build that from the ground up.\n\n426\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.880\nSo they're gonna start here in CCENT.\n\n427\n00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.356\nMake sure that you know what the heck\nyou're talking about if you have a Cisco\n\n428\n00:23:40.356 --> 00:23:42.911\ncertification, so it makes it valuable.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and\n\n429\n00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:46.490\nit surely is and that's one of the things\nthat really you do have to think about.\n\n430\n00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.940\nCuz you are right Daniel,\nboth answers are gonna be correct.\n\n431\n00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.611\nBut one is gonna be a better\nanswer than the other one because,\n\n432\n00:23:53.611 --> 00:23:56.512\nif they ask you specifically about 802.3.\n\n433\n00:23:56.512 --> 00:23:58.026\nEthernet frame, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n434\n00:23:58.026 --> 00:23:59.855\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can say is a layer too, but\n\n435\n00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:03.710\nifthey give you the right answer,\nwhich is a destination mac address.\n\n436\n00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.830\nYou should pick the one that you\nknow is gonna be 802.3 specific,\n\n437\n00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.120\nwhich is gonna be that one itself.\n\n438\n00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.780\nSo, that's actually gonna be key in\nsome of the stuff that we're doing.\n\n439\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.090\nAll right, Daniel,\nnow we've only went through this one time,\n\n440\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.000\nremember you at home as you do this,\nwhen you want to be able to go to this,\n\n441\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.490\nso I recommend if you're studying for\nthis, it's kind of an old school method.\n\n442\n00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:31.780\nBut make some, one they call flash cards,\nwhat are these called when\n\n443\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.470\nyou flip them back and forth flash cards.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] nowadays we can make your\n\n444\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.040\nown flashcards in an app and flip through\nthem on your phone, or whatever device\n\n445\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.030\nyou're on, makes it really, really easy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n446\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.630\nI would make something like that, and then\nhelp yourself out here, because you wanna\n\n447\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.542\nbe able to identify those quickly and\nyou're not guessing as well.\n\n448\n00:24:47.542 --> 00:24:54.220\nAll right, Daniel, now is time for us to\nkinda put our minds here to a little bit\n\n449\n00:24:54.220 --> 00:25:00.050\nof a test if all possible if we\ncan do something like this a tube.\n\n450\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.630\nSo, Daniel, here it is over on\nthe left hand side I have each\n\n451\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:09.462\none of those different parts\nof the ethernet frame 802.3.\n\n452\n00:25:09.462 --> 00:25:12.790\nAnd now, on the right hand side,\nI've explained it,\n\n453\n00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.910\nbut I've kind of done something that\nyou might see, which is summarize\n\n454\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.764\nthe description a little bit more [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n455\n00:25:19.764 --> 00:25:20.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.060\nTo make a little bit more just braced up.\n\n457\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.630\nJust the bare minimum to see if you can\nactually match these things up here.\n\n458\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.170\nNow, I'm not specifically talking\nabout Daniel himself, but you.\n\n459\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.380\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna make me look bad on TV.\n\n460\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not gonna make you look bad,\n\n461\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.620\nbut let's just try to see if we\ncan understand some of this.\n\n462\n00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.320\n&gt;&gt; I'll do my best.\n\n463\n00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:39.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so over\n\n464\n00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.540\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n465\n00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.770\nEach of this of course,\nthe actual frame, headers themselves.\n\n466\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.290\nAnd now over on the right hand side,\n\n467\n00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.850\neverybody has a different way of doing\nsome type of match up of this, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.678\nSo, Daniel, I'll start with the first\none to, because, to help us out, right?\n\n469\n00:25:52.678 --> 00:25:54.988\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n470\n00:25:54.988 --> 00:25:56.690\n&gt;&gt; Start a frame,\n\n471\n00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.630\nI want to take a look at all this\ninformation, I see it right there.\n\n472\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:07.692\nSo, I might just go ahead and make a match\nup, that allows me to link that up.\n\n473\n00:26:10.018 --> 00:26:11.960\nLike that, all right.\n\n474\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.080\nSo, start a frame, right there I\nwas able to match that one up.\n\n475\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.469\n&gt;&gt; I'm having trouble seeing the words\n\n476\n00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:18.580\nbehind your head, Ronnie,\nif we could go full screen.\n\n477\n00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.443\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, okay, yeah,\n\n478\n00:26:19.443 --> 00:26:22.017\nlet's go full screen there we go, so now-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] next bite is destination\n\n479\n00:26:22.017 --> 00:26:25.330\nMAC, that's right, okay I remember that\nyou talked about just a minute ago.\n\n480\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's do the okay?\n\n481\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.790\nSo, there was one key term that I\n\n482\n00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.700\nmentioned.\n&gt;&gt; There it was,\n\n483\n00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.180\nI'm gonna go with synchronization.\n&gt;&gt; And you are correct, Daniel,\n\n484\n00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:41.815\nsynchronization is gonna be the key\nhere that we want represented there.\n\n485\n00:26:41.815 --> 00:26:44.735\nI'm gonna say that this\nis the soft problem,\n\n486\n00:26:44.735 --> 00:26:45.365\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n487\n00:26:45.365 --> 00:26:47.625\n&gt;&gt; Destination MAC.\n\n488\n00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.033\n&gt;&gt; I can never remember that, Ronnie.\n\n489\n00:26:49.033 --> 00:26:49.561\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n490\n00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:53.265\n&gt;&gt; Such a toughy, synchronization?\n\n491\n00:26:53.265 --> 00:26:53.875\nNo, no.\n\n492\n00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:54.825\nI am gonna [INAUDIBLE] yeah.\n\n493\n00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:56.735\nDestination obviously\nis where we're going.\n\n494\n00:26:56.735 --> 00:26:57.402\n&gt;&gt; Destination, and\n\n495\n00:26:57.402 --> 00:26:59.786\nwell at least I hope it's obvious\nthat that's where we're going.\n\n496\n00:26:59.786 --> 00:27:00.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\n\n497\n00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:01.286\nI'd be excited to.\n\n498\n00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Though-\n\n499\n00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.960\n&gt;&gt; We not taking anything for granted,\n\n500\n00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.600\ndoing right?\n&gt;&gt; No, every once in a while,\n\n501\n00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.220\nI can't guarantee that they'll see, but\nyou kinda get the idea that we're doing.\n\n502\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.890\nNow, this next one, though, may be\na little bit harder, because it doesn't\n\n503\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:19.250\nnecessarily refer to anything really\ndescriptive about the contents in here.\n\n504\n00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.700\nBut now, let's take a look\nbehind my head again, and\n\n505\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.920\nthere's another option here too.\n\n506\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.620\nSo, link and type, I guess,\n\n507\n00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.160\nfrom what you have here,\nI would say this can be one or the other,\n\n508\n00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.690\nnot both.\n&gt;&gt; That is good,\n\n509\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.820\nnow, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n510\n00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.280\nit doesn't specifically tell you what.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't tell you that but.\n\n511\n00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.950\n&gt;&gt; We know that's a fact about that,\n\n512\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.000\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n513\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.490\nthat's something else you\nhave to pay attention to.\n\n514\n00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:49.550\nSometimes it may not be where on the exam\nthey tell you a lot more than just that\n\n515\n00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.880\ngeneral description, right?\n\n516\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.240\nSo, on any of these\nfields well it could be,\n\n517\n00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.350\nbut notice we said one, or\nthe other it can't be both.\n\n518\n00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.240\nSo, remember that when we talked about\nit like in the terms of the layer two\n\n519\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.640\naddress, are those two right answers?\n\n520\n00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.010\nAbsolutely.\n\n521\n00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.260\nBut we know something about length, or\ntype here, it can be one, or the other,\n\n522\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.250\nbut it can't be both with that,\n\n523\n00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.930\nis what we can do.\n&gt;&gt; Plus we have the process of elimination\n\n524\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.970\ngoing, don't forget that, right?\n\n525\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.784\nIf you're looking at something and\nyou see, I don't know exactly,\n\n526\n00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:22.230\nI can never remember this one,\nor that one.\n\n527\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.715\nDo the ones that you do know, and\n\n528\n00:28:23.715 --> 00:28:27.000\nthat's just going to leave you\nwith the ones you're not 100% on.\n\n529\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.030\nAnd then, you should be able\nto figure out from there.\n\n530\n00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.071\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All right, no, that's a great idea.\n\n531\n00:28:31.071 --> 00:28:32.050\nSo, Source Mac.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n532\n00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:32.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say,\n\n533\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.110\nthat's gonna be the Sending NIC.\n\n534\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.370\nSo, hopefully that makes sense for me.\n\n535\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:41.010\nAnd then, Data and Pad,\nthat's layer 3 PDU.\n\n536\n00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.210\nAnd even though we just went over and\nit sounds easy enough, right?\n\n537\n00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.760\nBut let's say this is several weeks later.\n\n538\n00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.610\nWould you still feel confident in\ndoing this if you saw this again\n\n539\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.500\nseveral weeks later?\n\n540\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.790\nAnd now here's.\n\n541\n00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.160\nDaniel, this is the last one.\n\n542\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.500\nProcess of elimination here.\n&gt;&gt; Process of elimination.\n\n543\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.720\nObviously, it has to be\nsynchonization again.\n\n544\n00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.890\n&gt;&gt; Has to be synchonization.\n\n545\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.420\nThere you go.\n\n546\n00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.100\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; It is used to check for\n\n547\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.220\nerrors.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n548\n00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.250\nSo, here we have this idea\nwhere we can do this.\n\n549\n00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.740\nMost of the time, you probably won't\nsee anything like all of these, right?\n\n550\n00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.549\nBut at the same time, you need to feel\ncomfortable enough where if you see\n\n551\n00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:19.930\na description that you could go,\nall right.\n\n552\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.889\nI know what one of these is about,\nwhat they're about here, even if\n\n553\n00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:29.050\nthe description, or the definition is\nnot exactly the way that you learned it.\n\n554\n00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:34.160\nYou pick up on those key things about\nthose fields and that will help you out.\n\n555\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.010\nNow, Daniel, we're pretty much\nup against our time limit for\n\n556\n00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.300\nthis, and\nwe've talked about theoretically again.\n\n557\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.870\nBut what the heck does it\nactually look like in reality?\n\n558\n00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.410\nOkay?\n\n559\n00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.480\nSo, what we wanna do on our next\nepisode is that we want to capture\n\n560\n00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.230\nan ethernet frame.\n\n561\n00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:54.110\nAnd let's break that thing apart, and\njust take a look at it briefly, so\n\n562\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.350\nthat we can see what it looks like.\n\n563\n00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:59.150\nAnd we'll be using Wireshark to help\nus out, just so that we can examine\n\n564\n00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.000\nhow that breakdown comes about.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it sounds like a great plan.\n\n565\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.710\nI look forward to executing it with you.\n\n566\n00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.740\nBut like you said,\nwe're out of time for this episode, so\n\n567\n00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.600\nwe will have to make another.\n\n568\n00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.040\nAnd thank you for joining us.\n\n569\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.350\nWe do thank you, as always,\nfor joining us as well.\n\n570\n00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.910\nI hope you have enjoyed this episode.\n\n571\n00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:14.790\nWe've got more to come.\n\n572\n00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.820\nSo, stick around.\n\n573\n00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.550\nAs for this one,\nwe're signing off for ITPro TV.\n\n574\n00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.090\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n575\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.151\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n576\n00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:27.910\n[MUSIC]\n\n577\n00:30:27.910

00:00:12.177\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:14.163\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:16.838\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:17.967\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:22.063\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nwe are back with more in our CCENT series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:25.310\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio\nyet again lending his expertise,\n\n9\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.794\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:27.754\nRonnie, welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:28.420\nHow is it going today.\n\n12\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.470\n&gt;&gt; It's going well Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.792\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue on learning more about,\n\n14\n00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:35.465\nof course, the CISCO CCENT.\n\n15\n00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:37.197\nGetting ready for that exam.\n\n16\n00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:39.736\nBut also specifically we're in a part two.\n\n17\n00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:44.777\nI'm taking a look at of course at\nthe Ethernet frame, the 802.3 frame.\n\n18\n00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:45.900\nWhen you start talking about it.\n\n19\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.514\nWe've talked about the breakdown,\nwe showed you some of the things that you\n\n20\n00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:51.786\nneed to make sure that you understand and\nknow.\n\n21\n00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:54.199\nBut one of the elements\nthat normally has people,\n\n22\n00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.188\nespecially if this is your first\ntime seeing it, it's like,\n\n23\n00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:00.690\nwell what does it actually look like or\nwhat does it actually do?\n\n24\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.150\nWhen it goes across to wear how do\nthese devices end up seeing this\n\n25\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.560\nwhen stuff like this ends up happening,\nokay?\n\n26\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.051\nSo I wanted a chance to show you how we\ncan take a look at the idea of the frames\n\n27\n00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:15.416\nand these PDUs as we started talking\nabout cuz it's always difficult.\n\n28\n00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:20.700\nJust theoretically understanding and it's\nkinda easy after you do it several times.\n\n29\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.381\nBut at the same time\nwhen you don't see it,\n\n30\n00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.072\nit doesn't really make that connection.\n\n31\n00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:28.977\nSo today we're just gonna take you\ninside of our lab setting here, and\n\n32\n00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:32.460\nshow you how you can see\nthese frames as well.\n\n33\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340\nAnd that we we can break them apart and\n\n34\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.775\nkind of look at the information\nin them as well.\n\n35\n00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:38.560\nSo that's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n36\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.010\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n37\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.280\nHere it is where I'm\nusing the practice lab.\n\n38\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.410\nI'm using one lab that\nthey have set up here.\n\n39\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.603\nThis is not an official practice lab.\n\n40\n00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:50.210\nThis is lab guide that they have set up.\n\n41\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.557\nThis is Ronnie Wong kind of doing\nthis ad hoc here for a moment.\n\n42\n00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:58.760\nBut what I have is that there is a router\nthat this machine is connected to.\n\n43\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.834\nThere's a couple of switches in between.\n\n44\n00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:07.873\nBut there's a router at the other end,\nand that router is at 192.168.16.1.\n\n45\n00:02:07.873 --> 00:02:11.066\nAnd I'm just verifying that I have\nconnectivity over there cuz if I don't\n\n46\n00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:14.710\nhave connectivity over there, this is\ngonna be a bust of a lab at this point.\n\n47\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.720\nSo I'm verifying that I\nhave connectivity and I do.\n\n48\n00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.312\nAnd now from this point, I want to\nbegin to take a look at that packet\n\n49\n00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:25.683\nheader information that\nwe're talking about.\n\n50\n00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:27.406\nSo I may have to zoom in\na couple of times and\n\n51\n00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:30.776\nI do this cuz there's some things that\nare on my task bar that aren't showing up.\n\n52\n00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:33.452\nBut for right now, let's go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:36.973\ntake a look at the software\nthat we're gonna use.\n\n54\n00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:41.050\nThere is a piece of software, and Daniel\nand have used this for years, and years,\n\n55\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.900\nand years now, that is called WireShark.\n\n56\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.930\nSo I'm simply gonna\nlaunch up WireShark here.\n\n57\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.070\nAnd when I do this, let me see if I can\nget us set back up a little bit better.\n\n58\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.866\nThere we go.\n\n59\n00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:54.155\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, remember back in the day\nwhen it was called Ethereal.\n\n60\n00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:55.216\n&gt;&gt; Ethereal, yeah.\n\n61\n00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:59.644\nThat was kind of\nthe earliest version of it.\n\n62\n00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:03.128\nToday WireShark is probably one of the\nmost popular pieces of software out there\n\n63\n00:03:03.128 --> 00:03:05.840\nand one of the most useful\npieces of software as well.\n\n64\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.390\nWhen it comes down to seeing what\ndata looks like on the wire,\n\n65\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.390\nthis is the way to go, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.390\nSo when we start to take a look\nhere at the idea of using this,\n\n67\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.290\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm gonna capture\nall the traffic leaving an interface and\n\n68\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.203\nalso coming back out to this machine\nthat we're on, which is the PLABCSC001.\n\n69\n00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:31.502\nSo that's what's gonna happen.\n\n70\n00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:34.753\nSo I'm gonna make a connection\nover to that router that's on, and\n\n71\n00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:38.300\nthen we're gonna also get the return\ntraffic that comes back in.\n\n72\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.430\nAnd I should be able to see\nthat data as we do this.\n\n73\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.722\nSo the first thing I need to do,\nof course,\n\n74\n00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:46.926\nis actually verify which\ninterface that's going to be on.\n\n75\n00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:51.900\nSo if I click on interface list here,\nI know that the machine that I\n\n76\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.250\njust pinged is on, well,\nthis 19216816 work.\n\n77\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.580\nI just pinged dot one instead of\ndot 10 which is perfectly fine.\n\n78\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.900\nAnd I'm not showing any other information,\nand that's fine.\n\n79\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.960\nI just want to start the capture, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.750\nWhen I now start the capture,\nit's gonna start\n\n81\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.660\ngetting some information that actually\ngoes out and is coming back in as well.\n\n82\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.440\nAnd we're just gonna leave that alone for\na moment.\n\n83\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.810\nWhen I do this, let me see if I\ncan minimize this for a moment.\n\n84\n00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.020\nCuz I need to launch up\nanother application.\n\n85\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.520\nI've turned on the web management\ninterface on that router.\n\n86\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.643\nSo if I get rid of the other\nInternet site here.\n\n87\n00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:39.516\nLet me go ahead and do that.\n\n88\n00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:48.978\nAnd then I do https://192.168.16.1\n\n89\n00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:52.346\nand I press Enter.\n\n90\n00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:55.066\nIt's gonna say, hey,\nhere's a certificate issue that you have.\n\n91\n00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:58.345\nAnd I'm gonna continue this website\neven though it's not recommended.\n\n92\n00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:03.415\nIt's gonna ask me for a username, and\nit's gonna ask me for a password.\n\n93\n00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:06.100\nHopefully I've actually gotten\nboth of those correct here.\n\n94\n00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.110\nAnd there we go, we are now on\nthe web management interface on\n\n95\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.790\na Cisco 2911 router called NYEDGE1, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.660\nSo that information that we have right\nthere its gonna cross, everything is good,\n\n97\n00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.080\nand that's the information\nI want to take a look at.\n\n98\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo Daniel at this point\nwe've sent TCP traffic.\n\n99\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.980\nWe've made a connection over to web\ninterface using of course the browser.\n\n100\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.780\nSo that's a good deal of\ninformation that we have.\n\n101\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.390\nNow let's take a look at the header\ninformation that we've been talking about.\n\n102\n00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.830\nSo I'm just going to simply\npark that down there.\n\n103\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.075\nAnd then let's stop my\ncatcher is what I want to do.\n\n104\n00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:47.220\nSo I'm gonna reduce that.\n\n105\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.880\nAnd let's see which one it\nactually brought up here.\n\n106\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.700\nThere we go, capturing.\n\n107\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.010\nSo then I'm going to hopefully\nthat's the stop one.\n\n108\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.265\nStop the live running\ncapture at that point.\n\n109\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.926\nAnd then let's see does this actually\nlet me zoom it, there we go or\n\n110\n00:06:06.926 --> 00:06:08.769\nmaybe that zooming in, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:13.643\nI think it is and then I'm like,\nI don't see it actually zooming in here.\n\n112\n00:06:13.643 --> 00:06:18.476\nBut now that is what I wanted to make\nsure that I could do was to zoom in.\n\n113\n00:06:18.476 --> 00:06:23.769\nSo now I can see if I\ncan filter by http here,\n\n114\n00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:28.181\nlet's see, we actually see http,\n\n115\n00:06:28.181 --> 00:06:36.205\nI guess it's actually probably\neasier if I do 192168.\n\n116\n00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:38.921\nI need the IP addressed, don't I?\n\n117\n00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:43.921\nIP addr, right?\n\n118\n00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:48.353\nMaybe just the IP.\n\n119\n00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:53.260\nWhen there's something right, my ability\nto filter is not coming to my mind here.\n\n120\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.310\nBut I'm just gonna scroll down here and\nsee if I can find out there is one.\n\n121\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.020\nThat actually does work exactly\nthe way that I want to.\n\n122\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.800\nSo there is the source as return traffic\ndoes coming back to me, and that's fine.\n\n123\n00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.250\nSo if I just pick that one and\nI double click on that here for a moment.\n\n124\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.620\nJust wanna make sure I\nselected one of them.\n\n125\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.410\nWhen I now begin to take a look at\nthe information, the details behind,\n\n126\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.640\nthat's right here, it tells me that this\nis frame 159, which is fine on the wire.\n\n127\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.330\nAnd that's what it captured here,\n480 bits of it.\n\n128\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.853\nBut now notice that underneath that,\nyou see where it says Ethernet 2,\n\n129\n00:07:31.853 --> 00:07:35.426\nyou also see where it says\nInternet Protocol Version 4.\n\n130\n00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:39.630\nYou also see where it says\nTransmission Control Protocol as well.\n\n131\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.230\nNow, Daniel, on each one of these, right,\nwhen you and I think of the OSI model,\n\n132\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.750\nwe're starting to see the OSI model\nactually work out here, right?\n\n133\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nat the very beginning we have the frame.\n\n134\n00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.853\nAnd notice the way that it's described\nin this parenthesis right here\n\n135\n00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:02.703\nI know it might be a little bit hard\nsince, yeah now I can see a little.\n\n136\n00:08:02.703 --> 00:08:03.890\nLet me see if i can zoom in\na little bit more cuz it's\n\n137\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.726\ndifficult for me to, there we go.\n\n138\n00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:06.130\nAnd no it actually went to bold.\n\n139\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.910\nAll right, that's even better.\n\n140\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.097\nSo now notice it says 480 bits.\n\n141\n00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:13.967\nWell, one of the ways that\nwe describe layer 1 is what?\n\n142\n00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:15.520\nBits, right, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.430\nSo this is saying here is\nthe layer 1 information,\n\n144\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.050\nand it shows me even the bits\nthat have been captured here.\n\n145\n00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.927\nAt this point also directly\nunderneath that is well, Ethernet 2.\n\n146\n00:08:27.927 --> 00:08:32.173\nNow that is one of those things that have\nhappened over a period of time, right?\n\n147\n00:08:32.173 --> 00:08:37.233\nThe original Ethernet that got developed\nand then it started to get modified and\n\n148\n00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:40.569\ntoday the way that we\ncapture is called Ethernet 2.\n\n149\n00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:44.920\nAnd now, Daniel, I can see that there's\na source MAC address right here.\n\n150\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.130\nThere's also a destination\nMAC address here.\n\n151\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.380\nAnd we know now MAC addresses are at\nwhat layer on the ozone model.\n\n152\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.330\n&gt;&gt; That's layer 2.\n\n153\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.270\n&gt;&gt; That is layer 2 information and in\nfront of each on of these around the left\n\n154\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.900\nhand side, there is a little plus sign.\n\n155\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.480\nAnd now if I start to expand that out,\nokay, I can start seeing other information\n\n156\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.150\nalso getting displayed, too So notice\nI can see the destination MAC address.\n\n157\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.140\nAnd if I expand that out,\nI can actually see how it came in and\n\n158\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.810\nthe actual data that came across\nhere in the wire as well.\n\n159\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.733\nAnd I can even see the source.\n\n160\n00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:26.421\nSo I'm starting to see some of that\ninformation that helps me on the packet\n\n161\n00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:28.928\ndelivery Notice this,\nDaniel, that third one.\n\n162\n00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:32.410\nRemember we talked about one of those\nheaders as being either length or type?\n\n163\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.320\nSo on this one it is an IP type as well,\nand\n\n164\n00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.610\nthis trailer,\nthat is our frame check sequence.\n\n165\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.980\nSo it doesn't give us everything\nin terms of like the preamble and\n\n166\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:47.310\nthe start of frame, but it does give\nus the rest of this information,\n\n167\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.390\nwhich we can now begin to see, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:55.030\nYou add that, that layer 2 header\ninformation in along now with\n\n169\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.990\nthe layer 3 PDU, which begins\nwith internet protocol version 4.\n\n170\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.140\nNow you can see a lot more\ninformation goes into here.\n\n171\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.590\nAnd each one of that pieces of information\nthat you see is now coming across.\n\n172\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.503\nAnd then here is also layer 4 information,\nwhich is the transport control,\n\n173\n00:10:14.503 --> 00:10:17.612\nor for us here,\ntransport layer, which is TCP.\n\n174\n00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:23.650\nI can now see I'm on port 443, the source\nport as well as destination port.\n\n175\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.810\nI can see the header link,\nflags, you name it.\n\n176\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.869\nOther checksum options that are there for\nerror recovery.\n\n177\n00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:31.800\nAll of this information.\n\n178\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.380\nThe sequencing, and\nacknowledgement analysis,\n\n179\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.130\nto verify of course that it went\nthrough the three way handshake.\n\n180\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.400\nAll that stuff and information\nis initially right here for us.\n\n181\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.900\nSo it gives us all of that information\n\n182\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.600\nwhen we start seeing something like this,\nokay?\n\n183\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.331\nSo that is really helpful to that\npoint to allow us to break that out.\n\n184\n00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:57.935\nSo every time when you send data out and\nwhen it comes back,\n\n185\n00:10:57.935 --> 00:11:02.390\nyou're getting this information\nalong with the data payload.\n\n186\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:07.652\nSo when the machine send it back and\nwe go that web page that showed that\n\n187\n00:11:07.652 --> 00:11:13.662\njust go 2911 K9 and the NY edge one,\nit came that's data payload itself.\n\n188\n00:11:13.662 --> 00:11:17.597\nBut it also came with this extra\ninformation, and this is normally what we\n\n189\n00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:20.839\nare looking for when we talk\nabout the idea of data delivery.\n\n190\n00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:24.271\nSo this is the information that makes it\nwork from device to device as well as\n\n191\n00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:26.930\nshowing whether or\nnot it's actually there.\n\n192\n00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.230\nDown at the bottom, this is how\nthe data actually looks going across.\n\n193\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.040\nThere's so much data.\n\n194\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.034\nLet me see.\nCan I hover over, there it goes.\n\n195\n00:11:34.034 --> 00:11:40.550\nOkay, so this is now the actual raw\ndata screen, if I can get that to hover.\n\n196\n00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.260\nBring that up.\n\n197\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.190\nSo when you select the raw\ndata itself like up here,\n\n198\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.650\nit even shows you how big and what parts\nof the data that we're talking about.\n\n199\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.026\nSo there's all of the bytes on the wire.\n\n200\n00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:57.523\nIf I wanna just look at layer 2\ninformation, that's the actual one,\n\n201\n00:11:57.523 --> 00:12:00.800\nreporting hexadecimal and\nthen whatever it is in alphanumeric.\n\n202\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.030\nIf it can translate it, it would be there.\n\n203\n00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.340\nYou name it's all right here.\n\n204\n00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.540\nIt's all stored right there so\nthat we can see it, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.400\nNow lets take a look at\nanother possibility, too.\n\n206\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.120\nSo we'll start a new capture here as well.\n\n207\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.976\nSo let me see if I can start a capture and\nlet me continue without saving.\n\n208\n00:12:20.545 --> 00:12:22.979\nAll right, so\nwe'll start a new capture on this point.\n\n209\n00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:26.900\nAnd let me see if I can clear\nthat particular expression.\n\n210\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.605\nThis time let's open an SSH connection.\n\n211\n00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:35.730\nSo this is one of\nthe configurations that you and\n\n212\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.023\nI learned about in our\nnetworking fundamentals.\n\n213\n00:12:39.023 --> 00:12:40.426\nI'm on SSH.\n\n214\n00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:45.489\nAnd do 192.168.16.1.\n\n215\n00:12:45.489 --> 00:12:47.180\nNow I'm gonna open that connection.\n\n216\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.150\nSay yes.\n\n217\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.729\nAnd let's see if I can make this a little\nbit larger so that we can see it.\n\n218\n00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:03.531\nWe'll change that up to 16 here or 18,\n\n219\n00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:07.830\nlet's do 18,\nwould make it a little bit easier for us.\n\n220\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:12.673\nAnd then we'll change the color,\ndefault foreground\n\n221\n00:13:12.673 --> 00:13:17.732\nwill make that one a white,\nhelp us to spot the contrast.\n\n222\n00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:18.683\nI'm gonna hit Apply.\n\n223\n00:13:20.324 --> 00:13:22.010\nSo now it's asking me to log in.\n\n224\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.830\nIf I enter in my username and\nalso my password.\n\n225\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.250\nAnd there we are we're actually inside of,\n\n226\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.950\nThe actual machine.\n\n227\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.050\nAnd this time I have you done this\nstage connection fully ready to go.\n\n228\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:47.644\nNow remember I've now love WireShark\ncapture, and that's what we wanted.\n\n229\n00:13:47.644 --> 00:13:51.534\nThen if I go and\nclose the session out, which is fine.\n\n230\n00:13:51.534 --> 00:13:55.879\nI can leave it up and\nrunning, I don't need to.\n\n231\n00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:58.043\nAnd I want to stop the capture here.\n\n232\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.299\nAnd what we're looking for just any\none of these that begins with SSH.\n\n233\n00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:10.600\nAnd I can see the protocol\nright here as what I can see.\n\n234\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.740\nOnce I have the one that I want,\nI can right-click and\n\n235\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.230\ngo to follow the TCP stream.\n\n236\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.250\nAnd then we can look at\nsome of the information\n\n237\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.970\nthat we can capture in between.\n\n238\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.203\nSo now we're actually looking at\nthe data that is being exchanged.\n\n239\n00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:31.115\nSo here is all of the encryption\ninformation that we're seeing.\n\n240\n00:14:31.115 --> 00:14:31.960\nThe red and\n\n241\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.380\nthe blue, of course, one side is actually\nthe response from what's being sent.\n\n242\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.640\nSo here is the negotiation of things.\n\n243\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.465\nAnd the rest of this is a complete and\nutter mess.\n\n244\n00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:43.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why is because it's\n\n245\n00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:43.648\nall encrypted.\n\n246\n00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:46.640\nSo I can't look inside\nof encrypted packages.\n\n247\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.590\nBut I can actually see that\nthe data is being exchanged here.\n\n248\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.200\nSo it does help us to\nset all the stuff up.\n\n249\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.719\nAnd in the background though [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just a clarification.\n\n250\n00:14:55.719 --> 00:15:00.730\nYou said you can't look inside of\nencrypted packages or packets.\n\n251\n00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.460\nCan we look inside of\nthem we just see crypto?\n\n252\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.020\n&gt;&gt; That's all you see.\n\n253\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.567\nYou see a mess.\n\n254\n00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:05.337\n&gt;&gt; We cant look inside.\n\n255\n00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.207\nWe just see the cryptographicaly.\n\n256\n00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.156\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n257\n00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:08.777\nIt doesn't, yeah.\n\n258\n00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:10.212\nSo you cant look into it.\n\n259\n00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:10.980\n&gt;&gt; Just wanted to make sure.\n\n260\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.440\n&gt;&gt; No, technically you are right.\n\n261\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.250\nYou can look into it, but they not-\n&gt;&gt; Without the key, forget it.\n\n262\n00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not exactly intelligible\nat that point when you see that.\n\n263\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.201\nBut yes, Daniel,\n\n264\n00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:22.505\nyou are absolutely correct-\n&gt;&gt; Ciphertext,\n\n265\n00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:23.490\nthat's the word I was looking for,\nciphertext.\n\n266\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually even better\nwhen you start doing that to.\n\n267\n00:15:28.335 --> 00:15:30.000\nAll right, so\nI was trying to pull this up.\n\n268\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.820\nSo now that I've selected on one\nof those packets there, let's,\n\n269\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.610\nagain, take a look, and you'll see\nthe same type of information once again.\n\n270\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.239\nNow, this time, notice that the frame and\nthe information,\n\n271\n00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:46.742\na little bit more the same thing.\n\n272\n00:15:46.742 --> 00:15:47.780\nSo all of it.\n\n273\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.843\nHere's where your OSI model,\nagain, prevails.\n\n274\n00:15:50.843 --> 00:15:51.870\nAnd then beings.\n\n275\n00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.440\nNow technically it's the TCPIP model,\nright?\n\n276\n00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.640\nThe very fact is, when you talk\nabout framed or delivery, right?\n\n277\n00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.210\nHere's the bits or\nthe data access, the access layer.\n\n278\n00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.860\nHere of course is the data length.\n\n279\n00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.700\nThis would be the internet layer.\n\n280\n00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.450\nAnd that would be the transport.\n\n281\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.090\nUltimately, there would be an application\nif we were using an application layer\n\n282\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:12.820\nup there to look at it.\n\n283\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.380\nBut when we talk about just\ndata delivery of the packets,\n\n284\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.330\nwe don't tend to open the application\nlayer up unless we're\n\n285\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.140\non the application and\npulling that through at the same time.\n\n286\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.230\nSo you will see all this information,\n\n287\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.740\nbut that's where all of that\nstuff that we keep talking about,\n\n288\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.180\ntheoretically, here's what it looks\nlike on the machine as it comes through.\n\n289\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.710\nSo when you get those replies and\n\n290\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.850\nyou're talking about where it is,\nthis is the information that we use.\n\n291\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.830\nAnd that's why it's so valuable and\nimportant for what we do.\n\n292\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.100\nAs you get into whatever specialty you get\ninto, like Daniel heads into security,\n\n293\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.674\nhe'll even show you how\nto break this stuff down.\n\n294\n00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:51.330\nAnd say, hey, here's the clue you're\nlooking for and this information.\n\n295\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:56.530\nBut for us it's just enough to at least\nknow yes the OSI model does matter, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.920\nAnd it is actually there.\n\n297\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.992\nWe're not just not-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not just a made up thing\n\n298\n00:17:00.992 --> 00:17:03.505\nthat we pretend exists and\nit actually just does.\n\n299\n00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:06.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is, when it comes\nacross the learning [INAUDIBLE] No,\n\n300\n00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.460\nreally, no, that's the way you\ninterpret it, is exactly right there.\n\n301\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.452\nAnd you can see it listed in the details\nsection where you see layer 1,\n\n302\n00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.860\nlayer 2, layer 3, as well as layer 4.\n\n303\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.276\nAnd all that's right there and\navailable for you.\n\n304\n00:17:21.276 --> 00:17:24.396\nSo just a little short demonstration\nto help us to cement that\n\n305\n00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:26.960\nconcept\n&gt;&gt; But make sure you pay attention to that\n\n306\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.840\nEthernet and that layer 2 header\nframe information as well.\n\n307\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.920\nThat's gonna be key,\n\n308\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.160\nmaking sure that you can identify\nthose components and those parts.\n\n309\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.880\nBecause we're in kind of\nthe topic on switching,\n\n310\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.030\nthat's really the component that\nwe're dealing with most often for\n\n311\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.450\nthe rest of what we're gonna be taking\na look at in this particular topic.\n\n312\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:51.151\nSo understanding that layer 2\ninformation key and them out.\n\n313\n00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:54.245\nBut just wanted to show you here where\nyou can actually take a look at if you\n\n314\n00:17:54.245 --> 00:17:54.900\nchoose it.\n\n315\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.980\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, great demonstration.\n\n316\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.430\nWe always like to see what we're learning\nin the wild like actually being done.\n\n317\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.169\nHow does this work itself out into\npracticality when we get out on the field\n\n318\n00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:06.232\nand start messing around with devices.\n\n319\n00:18:06.232 --> 00:18:11.111\nAnd this was a great look at away that\nyou most likely we'll have to deal with,\n\n320\n00:18:11.111 --> 00:18:13.110\nmaybe there's a layer 2 issue.\n\n321\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.640\nLet me fire up WireShark and\n\n322\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.840\nmake sure everything is going according\nto what I know it should be doing.\n\n323\n00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.904\nThat's a great way to do that.\n\n324\n00:18:19.904 --> 00:18:20.730\nRonnie, thanks for that.\n\n325\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.420\nWe always appreciate your time and effort.\n\n326\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.060\nAnd we appreciate you for\nwatching as well.\n\n327\n00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.048\nBut it looks like yes it\nwas a short episode, but\n\n328\n00:18:26.048 --> 00:18:27.709\nit had a lot of great information in it.\n\n329\n00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:28.920\nSo we're gonna call it a day.\n\n330\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.640\nThanks for watching.\n\n331\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.420\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n332\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.380\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n333\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.100\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n334\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:41.671\n[MUSIC]\n\n335\n00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:44.533\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:03.621\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.743\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:11.888\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:15.688\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:20.040\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're kicking it off\n\n8\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.100\nwith more of our CCENT series, or\nCCENT for you cool kids out there.\n\n9\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.640\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain and\n\n10\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.510\nlending his expertise, our good friend,\nthe one and only Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.524\nRonnie, welcome back.\nHow's it going, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:31.340\n&gt;&gt; It's going well Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.887\nThank you for having me on the show.\n\n14\n00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:36.612\nWe are continuing on of course in our\nCisco CCENT series making sure you're\n\n15\n00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:38.041\ngetting ready for the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.038\nAs well as helping you if you haven't\nbeen dealing with the Cisco equipment or\n\n17\n00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:46.282\neven the command line interface, or\nanything configuring of course with Cisco,\n\n18\n00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.470\nthis is the perfect place to begin.\n\n19\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.368\nAnd for us, we're part way through\nour series at this point and\n\n20\n00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:53.239\nwe're actually into our second topic.\n\n21\n00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.066\nWhich is gonna be a switching,\n\n22\n00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:59.180\nour LAN switching component of what\nwe're talking about for CCENT.\n\n23\n00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.840\nAnd it seems strange here,\n\n24\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.980\nbut right smack dab in one of those\nobjectives that they call out for,\n\n25\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.510\nthis particular topic is gonna be\ntroubleshooting interfaces and cables.\n\n26\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.450\nNow if we kind of backtracked a little bit\ninto the first topic, which was just basic\n\n27\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.520\nnetworking fundamentals, we already\ntalked about some of this, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.900\nAnd so we have a good understanding\nof different type of cables\n\n29\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.870\nthat are out there.\n\n30\n00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.880\nWe also have talked about\na few different things.\n\n31\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.650\nBut we didn't talked about things\nlike duplex, and speed, and\n\n32\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.280\nother things that really\nare important component to whether or\n\n33\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.430\nnot the devices will function\nthe way that they need to.\n\n34\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.100\nSo that is what we're\ngonna be dealing today,\n\n35\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.440\nand we're gonna take a look at how\nCISCO equipment informs us of these\n\n36\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.420\nother types of interface configurations\nthat we end up dealing with.\n\n37\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.184\nWe'll see some of the errors or some of\nthe different notifications that we get\n\n38\n00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:52.362\nwhen things are not set\nup correctly as well.\n\n39\n00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.950\nSo you might be wondering,\nwhy is this so important?\n\n40\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.025\nAt the very beginning, right?\n\n41\n00:01:57.025 --> 00:02:00.380\nWhenever you're actually taking some\ntype of instructor led training,\n\n42\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.716\nmore than likely,\nespecially at the CCENT level.\n\n43\n00:02:02.716 --> 00:02:06.640\nYou're gonna essentially be assigned\nto an interface of a single router and\n\n44\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.960\na single switch.\n\n45\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.510\nAnd they're gonna tell you, here's the\ncable that's connected between them, and\n\n46\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.000\nyou're really gonna work\nwith that one cable.\n\n47\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.039\nAnd that sounds perfect because\nthat's the image in your mind,\n\n48\n00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.923\nthe basic topology that we're\nreally granted to deal with.\n\n49\n00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:23.714\nSo, at that point of course then you\ncould plug a laptop into the switch,\n\n50\n00:02:23.714 --> 00:02:26.380\nyou can run a console, one between them.\n\n51\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.637\nThat's kind of the topology\nthat you're limited to.\n\n52\n00:02:28.637 --> 00:02:31.149\nWhen it comes to reality though, right?\n\n53\n00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.990\n[LAUGH] This is where it gets a little\nbit scarier as you get hired on.\n\n54\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.989\nMaybe as a CCENT for your company,\nthey're gonna just kinda open this door.\n\n55\n00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.506\nAnd there's gonna be a wall full of\nCisco routers or just a few routers and\n\n56\n00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:47.890\nmaybe a wall full of switches.\n\n57\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.040\nAnd now cables are gonna go,\nwell wherever they go.\n\n58\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.167\nAnd it may look like a string\nof spaghetti everywhere, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:59.810\nWhere it's almost like a web of different\nthings that you see or a bird's nest.\n\n60\n00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.405\nOther places of course would be neatly.\n\n61\n00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:05.760\nOkay, neatly bundled and tract\ntogether and everything looks perfect.\n\n62\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.193\nBut Daniel, even if I was to follow let\nsay that one port to that one router and\n\n63\n00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:14.972\nthen try to connect that back to a switch\nwhether it's actually kinda that web mess\n\n64\n00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:15.750\nthat we see.\n\n65\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.417\nOr whether it's actually in this\nnice tight bundle of like 25 or\n\n66\n00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:21.040\n30 cables in there.\n\n67\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.038\nIt may be a little bit harder to actually\nknow what you're connected to, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:27.688\nAnd that means troubleshooting\nsome of these devices, and\n\n69\n00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:31.500\nfiguring out what table\nis actually which one.\n\n70\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.770\nYou're gonna actually need\nto know a little bit more,\n\n71\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.460\nas well as actually figuring out\nwhether it's configured correctly too.\n\n72\n00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.978\nSo that's what at today,\n\n73\n00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:42.711\nis how CISCO equipment helps us\nto identify those connections.\n\n74\n00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:45.335\nAnd some of the things that\nwill make our network work or\n\n75\n00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:48.450\nmight not allow it to work\nthe way that needs to.\n\n76\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.849\nSo Daniel, today we're gonna be\ntalking about that idea of duplex and\n\n77\n00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.780\nspeed like I said.\n\n78\n00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.068\nAnd then in the end here, we're also of\ncourse, gonna end up covering this idea\n\n79\n00:03:57.068 --> 00:04:01.100\nof what we call auto-MDIX or\nMDIX auto, however you want to say it.\n\n80\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.000\nI learned it as auto-MDIX,\nit's always in my mind that way.\n\n81\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.290\nAnd that is of course,\nchoosing what cable actually goes where.\n\n82\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.220\nWe've already done that\nin a previous episode,\n\n83\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.490\nbut we'll kind of review the concept.\n\n84\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.279\nWe'll also show you how you can set it and\n\n85\n00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.657\nconfigure it inside of your\nswitches as well, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:18.090\nAnd your routers too.\n\n87\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.960\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart this way instead.\n\n88\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.971\nSo right here on my screen, I've gone\nahead and I've launched up practice labs.\n\n89\n00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:27.916\nThere's a complete lab for this,\n\n90\n00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:31.200\nmake sure you follow along\nin the guide as you do this.\n\n91\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.845\nLet me show you the name of this guide\nis gonna be Iinterface Configuration and\n\n92\n00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:36.495\nCabling.\n\n93\n00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:40.790\nAnd it does have all the steps for\nyou too, to allow you to do something.\n\n94\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.562\nNow Daniel, I also wanna point out kind\nof a practice labs kind of a secret\n\n95\n00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:48.306\ntrick that happens sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; I like secret tricks.\n\n96\n00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does help.\n\n97\n00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.017\nI don't know why, every once in\nawhile these particular routers and\n\n98\n00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:57.190\nswitches that you see right\nhere that's available for you.\n\n99\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.410\nYou go and then you click on that lab and\nit starts them all up.\n\n100\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.804\nBut sometimes it seemed like\nthey'll stay busy like forever, and\n\n101\n00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.118\nyou're just sitting there, just waiting.\n\n102\n00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:09.160\nWell one of the things I discovered\nwhen launched this one up,\n\n103\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.143\ncuz it just kept me waiting,\nis that down here at the bottom,\n\n104\n00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:15.020\na lot of times if I waited for\nthree or four minutes.\n\n105\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.124\nI just click on the Next, and\n\n106\n00:05:16.124 --> 00:05:18.473\neverything on the right hand\nside will gray out a little bit.\n\n107\n00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:22.600\nBut when it comes back up,\nall these will actually end up saying on.\n\n108\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.795\nSo it's like it's just a stuck\nreport setting that's there.\n\n109\n00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:26.600\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n110\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.568\n&gt;&gt; So if you do that,\n\n111\n00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:31.455\nit'd all go to on just about immediately,\nand then you can click Back.\n\n112\n00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:33.120\nAnd that will go back to the first one,\nand\n\n113\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.070\nthen you'll be able to follow the lab\nsteps along if you choose to.\n\n114\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.264\nBut that's just kind of a practice labs,\n\n115\n00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:41.911\nhint that may help you to expedite\nyour ability to work through labs.\n\n116\n00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:45.250\nInstead of doing like me like,\nall right, I've waited 15 minutes now,\n\n117\n00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.970\nthis thing is never coming up.\n\n118\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.314\nLogging out and\nthen you restart again and it stays busy.\n\n119\n00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:52.550\nSo I tried a few different things and\nthat's just one of the hints.\n\n120\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.044\nI was like that's a good one, to let\neverybody know if you happen to run into\n\n121\n00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.275\nthat, cuz you may run into that as well,\nokay?\n\n122\n00:05:58.275 --> 00:05:59.960\nAll right, so Daniel,\n\n123\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.370\nlet's talk about this idea of duplex right\naway as we start talking about it, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.928\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of duplex, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:12.390\nFor us, there's two different\ntypes of duplexes, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.754\nThere's half duplex and\nthere's full duplex, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:20.310\nSo this is about the transmission that\ngoes across that wire that we have.\n\n128\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.349\nAnd most of the connect, actually every\nconnection that we have here in this\n\n129\n00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.781\nlab is gonna be a copper type\nof connection that we'll have.\n\n130\n00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:29.140\nAnd we'll show you,\nhow you can identify that.\n\n131\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.955\nOverall though,\n\n132\n00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:33.171\nthat's what we're generally talking\nabout especially in this lab.\n\n133\n00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:38.073\nWhen you start talking about the idea\nof half duplex, it means that,\n\n134\n00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:44.890\nthat interface can send or it can receive\ndata, but it can't do both simultaneously.\n\n135\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.183\nWhen you talk about the idea of full\nduplex, that means it can send and\n\n136\n00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:50.900\nreceive simultaneously.\n\n137\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.720\nAnd you might be wondering like how the\nheck does that end up working where you\n\n138\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.180\ncan send and receive simultaneously?\n\n139\n00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.200\nWell, in the way of copper cabling\nlike what you and I are dealing with,\n\n140\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.285\nwe tend to use pairs of wires\nis what ends up happening.\n\n141\n00:07:04.285 --> 00:07:09.180\nSo in a half duplex, you normally\nend up getting one pair of wires.\n\n142\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.115\nAnd that way you can transmit or\n\n143\n00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:14.627\nyour device can receive on\nthat one pair of wire, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:18.930\nBut you cannot do both of them\non that wire at the same time.\n\n145\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.802\nWhen we go to full duplex, we normally\nend up using at least two pairs of wires.\n\n146\n00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:27.380\nAnd so we can actually send on one pair,\nand receive on the other.\n\n147\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.713\nSo it allows us to be able to do that and\nthat's the idea of full duplex.\n\n148\n00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:34.361\nThen comes this idea like, well Ronnie,\n\n149\n00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:39.270\nwhat if we start using fiber\noptic cabling then, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.091\nWell the way that that can actually end up\nworking, it depends on the cabling itself.\n\n151\n00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:46.246\nBut most of the time if you take a look\nat the idea of a fiber optic cable,\n\n152\n00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:49.630\nyou'll see that there's\nnormally two interfaces.\n\n153\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.901\nOne for sending and one for receiving.\n\n154\n00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:55.969\nSo it helps out, and that helps you to\ncreate the loop that it needs to to form\n\n155\n00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.730\nthat fiber optic connection that we need.\n\n156\n00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.350\nSo we normally see that as well.\n\n157\n00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.287\nSo most of the time, that's why you'll\nget that full duplex on fiber pretty much\n\n158\n00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:07.390\nwhen you start doing that.\n\n159\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.340\nIn other ways, of course,\nyou can even put more and more bandwidth.\n\n160\n00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.330\nBecause then you can start separating\nout based on the wavelength\n\n161\n00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.410\nof data that you're sending as well.\n\n162\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.000\nBut at this point,\nthat's what we want to understand.\n\n163\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.310\nSo half duplex, full duplex.\n\n164\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.950\nSo how do we see this when\nit comes down to a switch?\n\n165\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.280\nAnd how do we know a switch can\nactually handle either half or full or\n\n166\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.940\nwhatever it can do, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.490\nSo I'm gonna use NYCORE1 and\nI just selected that over here.\n\n168\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.450\nAnd that brought me into this field.\n\n169\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.410\nI'm already zoomed in a little bit,\nso that we can see it.\n\n170\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.430\nI need to make sure that of course,\nI can get access to this.\n\n171\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.310\nGo into the privileged EXEC mode.\n\n172\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.519\nOnce I'm in privileged EXEC,\nI'm gonna type\n\n173\n00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:55.195\nin show interface fastethernet 1/0/1.\n\n174\n00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.038\nWe're looking for its capabilities.\n\n175\n00:08:57.038 --> 00:09:03.080\nSo I could just type in the word\ncapabilities and in a moment, it will\n\n176\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.850\ngive us all the details of what we talked\nabout here in terms of capabilities.\n\n177\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.620\nSo notice it tells me the actual platform\nthat I’m on, which is gonna be this 3750.\n\n178\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.710\nAnd this is a 24 port work switch,\nif you wanna use WS as that one.\n\n179\n00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.930\nAnd then this is a 3750,\nwhich is a pretty nice switch for us.\n\n180\n00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.095\nIt gives us the type of this\nparticular interface as well.\n\n181\n00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:33.376\nSo fastethernet 1/0/1, notice right here,\n\n182\n00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:38.450\nwhere it actually says 10/100 base.\n\n183\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.970\nWhenever you see that idea of base and\nthat terminology,\n\n184\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.120\nnormally what we're talking about now\nis some type of baseband transmission,\n\n185\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.210\nwhich means it is going\nacross copper cabling, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.930\nSo a lot of information that we're\nlearning about this interface just in\n\n187\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.480\nthe first two lines.\n\n188\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.690\nAnd notice here, not only is it copper\ncabling on that term base here,\n\n189\n00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.820\ntoo, so usually that's the baseband.\n\n190\n00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:08.750\nNotice the term TX and that tells us\nwhat that type of wire also is gonna be.\n\n191\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.380\nAnd TX stands for twisted pair is what it\nstands for or what we actually want here.\n\n192\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.370\nSo that's what you end up seeing in\nat least this for some information.\n\n193\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.980\nThe other one that we also want\nto take a look at of course,\n\n194\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.670\nis gonna be these next two.\n\n195\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.170\nNow we're gonna focus in on\nthe idea of duplex first.\n\n196\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.440\nSo let's go down to duplex.\n\n197\n00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.050\nAnd right here Daniel, in this second\ncolumn, I see where it actually says half.\n\n198\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.530\nWhere is says full and then Daniel,\n\n199\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:45.230\nI didn't actually mention this last option\nright here, which is the word auto.\n\n200\n00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.620\nOkay, now that's kinda strange.\n\n201\n00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.870\nI kind of get the idea of half and\nfull cuz we explained it.\n\n202\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.430\nBut what the heck do you\nthink auto might mean?\n\n203\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.280\n&gt;&gt; I think it's short for\n\n204\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.228\nautonomous, Ronnie.\n\n205\n00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:56.223\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n206\n00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:57.695\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well and\n\n207\n00:10:57.695 --> 00:10:58.490\nit is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n208\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm being facetious but\n\n209\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.160\nthat's exactly right.\n\n210\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.830\nIt does it automatically,\nwhatever you need it to do, it's going to\n\n211\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.270\npick the option and then do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n212\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.880\nhere you're getting some of the Daniel\nCisco experience coming through here.\n\n213\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.816\nShining like the bright light\nthat it really is here.\n\n214\n00:11:12.816 --> 00:11:15.909\nWhat this is saying is that this\nparticular interface, right,\n\n215\n00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:17.180\nwe can hard set it to half.\n\n216\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.510\nWe can hard set it to full.\n\n217\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.110\nBut we can also do what we call auto.\n\n218\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.590\nAnd auto essentially means, let's do this.\n\n219\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.400\nI will stay at auto here, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.760\nIf the other side is hard set to half,\nI'll set myself to half.\n\n221\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.050\nIf the other side is set to full,\nI'll set myself to full, as well.\n\n222\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.500\nI will just automatically go ahead and\n\n223\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.730\nnegotiate whatever the other\nside wants me to be able to do.\n\n224\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.830\nNow that all sounds good, okay and it all\nsounds very much like what we want to.\n\n225\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.110\nBut auto, especially in the Cisco world,\n\n226\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.090\ncan be a little bit evil when it\ncomes down to troubleshooting.\n\n227\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.250\nAnd the reason behind this is because\neven though it likes to negotiate with\n\n228\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.830\nwhatever's hard set on the other side,\nwhere you may find some issues, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.550\nOn older devices,\nnot most of the new ones here.\n\n230\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.680\nOn older devices,\n\n231\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.750\nyou may find out that if both ends are set\nto auto, it doesn't know what to do.\n\n232\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.610\nBecause it's expecting to hear what,\n\n233\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.010\nsomething from the other side\nsaying set yourself to this.\n\n234\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.930\nAnd this side saying, set myself to what,\n\n235\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:30.520\nyou haven't told me anything cuz it's\nactually expecting to hear from you,\n\n236\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.570\nand you're expecting to hear from it and\nit's not hearing anything.\n\n237\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.840\nBut the great thing\nabout the newer devices.\n\n238\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.810\nAnd I say newer, right, everything\nis relative when you start talking\n\n239\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.960\nabout the realm of Cisco here, okay?\n\n240\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.840\nSo in newer devices, a lot of times,\nthere's also of course a default setting.\n\n241\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.590\nSo even with auto,\nit defaults to one or the other.\n\n242\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.360\nWhether it's the half or\nfull, it defaults that.\n\n243\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.600\nToday most of them are gonna be full,\nthere's really no use for\n\n244\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.350\nus doing half duplex anymore.\n\n245\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.170\nBut if there were a time that we needed\nto, such as we are connecting to legacy\n\n246\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.410\ndevices, that will only\ntransmit at a half, a duplex.\n\n247\n00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.950\nThen yeah, setting it a half duplex\nwill actually help you out and\n\n248\n00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.050\nthat's why you also have this\nability to do so as well.\n\n249\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.295\nSo for us,\nthat's what it ends up being, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:21.040\nSo it allows us to negotiate\nwhat we want here.\n\n251\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.220\nSo now that we understand that or\nFastEthernet1/0/1 does this.\n\n252\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.640\nWhat is actually set on\nthis particular interface?\n\n253\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.830\nWell, let's see if we can\nfind out now as well.\n\n254\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:41.230\nI'm gonna do a show interface here or\nactually, show running-config.\n\n255\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.026\nSo we're going into the entire\nconfiguration to see it and\n\n256\n00:13:45.026 --> 00:13:50.380\nthen we're specifically going into\nthe interface of fast ethernet 1/0/1.\n\n257\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.586\nSo we're saying show the entire running\ninterface but really right here,\n\n258\n00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:56.330\nis what we're focusing in on.\n\n259\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.980\nJust show me that\nparticular portion of it.\n\n260\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.090\nAnd now you see it looks kind of, well,\n\n261\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.550\nnot exactly anything to\nkind of have to dig into.\n\n262\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.920\nYou're actually seeing where it said hey,\nit's there, it's on and\n\n263\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.200\nthat's the default.\n\n264\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.050\nNow this is where it becomes tricky\non switches versus routers, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.280\nWhen a switch is set to the default, it\ndoesn't show you any information at all,\n\n266\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.280\nokay, none of the information.\n\n267\n00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.260\nBut if you and I were to go let's say for\nan example, to a router.\n\n268\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.161\nSo I selected NYEDGE01 here.\n\n269\n00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.060\nLet me press Enter.\n\n270\n00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.100\nAnd get in here.\n\n271\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.590\nLet's do show running-config.\n\n272\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:44.550\nAnd then we'll do interface and we'll\ndo gigabit ethernet 0/0 at this point.\n\n273\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.270\nNow notice here Daniel,\non the router configuration,\n\n274\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.300\neven the default information shows up.\n\n275\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.860\nSo this one on the router shows me\nthat hey, I don't have an IP address.\n\n276\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.070\nThat's a default.\n\n277\n00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:03.140\nIt shows me the duplex is\nautomatically set to automatic,\n\n278\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.350\ndefault set to auto and\nthe speed is also set.\n\n279\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.850\nSo, when we compare that you may\nactually see that difference,\n\n280\n00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.850\nwhereas the core switch here, which\nis a switch, when we see the defaults\n\n281\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.360\nnothing is actually set to what we\nbelieve it's going to be set to.\n\n282\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.150\nSo it just says, hey,\nthe default settings are done.\n\n283\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.440\nSo as you modify that configuration,\n\n284\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.350\nwhen you change it to hard,\nthen the information will show\n\n285\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.750\nup on a switch whereas on a router\nit shows everything, okay?\n\n286\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.020\nSo it's a good kind of way that we\ncan begin to actually understand\n\n287\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.600\nsome of the different things\nthat we can see here, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.810\nNow the other thing, of course,\n\n289\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.620\nthat we can do is,\nI still haven't shown you what we said.\n\n290\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.530\nWe need to figure out what is the status\nof that switch for duplexing, right?\n\n291\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:49.473\nSo now I can do a show, interface,\n\n292\n00:15:49.473 --> 00:15:54.599\ngonna type show interface status.\n\n293\n00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:58.235\nLet me see if I can hit that Oops,\ntoo many, I need to go back.\n\n294\n00:15:58.235 --> 00:15:58.982\n&gt;&gt; Went a little crazy Ronnie.\n\n295\n00:15:58.982 --> 00:15:59.548\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n296\n00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:00.692\n&gt;&gt; Jiminy Clicker over here.\n\n297\n00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:02.975\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all the way back too,\n\n298\n00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:08.150\nI gotta be careful, little tiny, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.300\nSo let's focus in on the port, FA,\n\n300\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.325\nwhich is again an abbreviation for\nFast Ethernet here.\n\n301\n00:16:15.325 --> 00:16:20.050\n1/0/1, look at the information\nthat shows up too\n\n302\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.050\nIt shows me that I am\nconnected to another device.\n\n303\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.100\nIt talks about VLAN 1 which we're\ngonna get into in a few episodes here.\n\n304\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:33.590\nAnd then now we were specifically\nfocusing in on the idea of duplex.\n\n305\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.800\nNow the way that duplex is\nregistering right now, right?\n\n306\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.660\nIt is set to a-full, okay.\n\n307\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.744\nNotice Daniel though, in fa1/0/3,\n\n308\n00:16:46.744 --> 00:16:51.140\nthis one is set to auto, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.010\nSo one is set to auto-full and\nthis one is set to auto here.\n\n310\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.620\nIf you and I were to compare both of them.\n\n311\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.568\nThe real big difference is that FA1/0/1\n\n312\n00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:09.780\nsays connected and\n1/0/3 says not connected.\n\n313\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.190\nSo it is saying, look,\nthere's nothing on this one.\n\n314\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.580\nAnd when I did that, here's what ended up\nhappening, is I just, it's set to auto.\n\n315\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.110\nIt's ready to negotiate, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:25.855\nThe other one, though,\nFA1/0/1 is set as, it is set to auto.\n\n317\n00:17:25.855 --> 00:17:28.115\nBut it didn't negotiate to Full.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n318\n00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:30.185\nthat's the a- Full.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n319\n00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:31.785\n&gt;&gt; So it's running a Full but\n\n320\n00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:33.235\nit did that automatically.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n321\n00:17:33.235 --> 00:17:34.125\nIt negotiated it.\n\n322\n00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:38.485\nIt found out whatever the other side said\nthat it was reporting, let's say here.\n\n323\n00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:39.615\nAnd it said, look.\n\n324\n00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:41.175\nI was set to auto.\n\n325\n00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:43.955\nIf I was not connected,\nyou plug the wire in.\n\n326\n00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:44.815\nWe negotiated.\n\n327\n00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:45.925\nWe talked about it.\n\n328\n00:17:45.925 --> 00:17:49.380\nAnd we decided on Full is\nwhat ended up happening.\n\n329\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.670\nAnd that's kinda the default.\n\n330\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.660\nSo this is what happens too,\n\n331\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.980\non the other end what if this is plugged\ninto another device that set to auto.\n\n332\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.305\nWell it says look, it's set to auto and\nboth sides set to auto.\n\n333\n00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:02.540\nw We're gonna default to full okay?\n\n334\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.890\nSo So unless the other sides says,\nspecifically states half.\n\n335\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.400\nSo it is just reading\nthe other side's saying auto.\n\n336\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.660\nThe other side's saying auto,\n\n337\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.420\nlet's negotiate a pull.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n338\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.680\nthere's no standoff.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n339\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.980\n&gt;&gt; Going you, you're gonna move.\n\n340\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.710\nNo you move.\n\n341\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.570\nNo, I won't move until you move.\n\n342\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.240\nThey have a built in mechanism that says,\n\n343\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.330\nwe have to eventually\nget past that somehow.\n\n344\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.370\nAnd it's gonna be done like this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n345\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.300\nthat should be happening from now on.\n\n346\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.510\nThere are older switches though.\n\n347\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.850\nNot in particular on the idea\nof the interface statuses.\n\n348\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.720\nBut on other things that you can\nfigure like with span entry and stuff.\n\n349\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.130\nIf some of this stuff is set and\nboth sides are set to auto.\n\n350\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.650\nIt depends on the actual\nmodel number at that point.\n\n351\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.760\nWhether or not it will negotiate\nautomatically or whether it does.\n\n352\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.260\nYeah, no, the other side's set to auto.\n\n353\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.460\nI'm not gonna respond to that.\n\n354\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.380\nCuz I'm expecting to see a hard\nsetting on the other side.\n\n355\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.360\nSo it really is kind of,\n\n356\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.150\nit's just one of those things where\nthis is how picky Cisco gets, right?\n\n357\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.030\nIt's even dependent on that model or\nthat platform number.\n\n358\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.240\nSo for example like 3560s will go,\nokay, is the other side set to auto?\n\n359\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.398\nI'm just gonna negotiate at\nwhatever the highest speed I can.\n\n360\n00:19:04.398 --> 00:19:08.770\nWhereas the 35-50, so just the difference\nof two numbers, it says nah,\n\n361\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.030\nthe other side's auto?\n\n362\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.386\nI'm not gonna work at all.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:19:11.386 --> 00:19:12.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just not gonna work.\n\n364\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.670\nSo that's what happens, so\nthat's why I say the term auto,\n\n365\n00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.320\nespecially when you're troubleshooting.\n\n366\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.520\nYou don't know\n\n367\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.010\nexactly what it's always gonna default to.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n368\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.180\n&gt;&gt; So even though we can kind of make\n\n369\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.710\nan assumption, and even educated guess\n&gt;&gt; Depending on that platform and\n\n370\n00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.300\nthe age of that platform and\nsome of the other things.\n\n371\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.660\nYou might find yourself in this\nweird thing where the auto you go.\n\n372\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.800\nIt's supposed to automatically do this,\nbut it's not.\n\n373\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.990\nAnd that's where you run into issues.\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, in that case where you had\n\n374\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.280\na Legacy device that was saying\nyou what you're set to auto.\n\n375\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.730\nAnd I'm set to auto and\n\n376\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.310\nremovable object means unstoppable force.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.850\n&gt;&gt; What we would have to do.\n\n378\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.430\nWould have to manually go in and\n\n379\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.050\nchange one of them?\n&gt;&gt; We would.\n\n380\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.670\nAnd normally what you do, so\nespecially in troubleshooting.\n\n381\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.630\nYou're like,\nhopefully this is not the issue.\n\n382\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.420\nWhere it's an automatic configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n383\n00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.980\n&gt;&gt; It'd be better to set both sides.\n\n384\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.580\nThat way you know, okay?\n\n385\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.940\nSo that way you don't have to\nactually guess of whether or\n\n386\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.290\nnot\n&gt;&gt; Is it a negotiation thing that's also\n\n387\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.010\ncausing the issue?\n\n388\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.550\nBut now you can go all right,\nlet's set both sides to full or\n\n389\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.400\nwhatever it might be.\n\n390\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.200\nWhatever the setting is\nmake sure both sides match.\n\n391\n00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.430\nAnd that way you can say all right,\n\n392\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.810\nthis is not gonna be an issue.\n&gt;&gt; I know that's\n\n393\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.620\nworking.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n394\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.390\nYeah, you don't have to worry about that.\n\n395\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.110\nBut once you leave one side as auto,\nyou have to guess.\n\n396\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.830\nYou have to guess is this an issue or\n\n397\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.790\nis it not an issue?\n&gt;&gt; The easiest way is simply setting\n\n398\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.480\nthem both to what they need to be.\n\n399\n00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.910\nHard set them and\nthat's the way to go, okay?\n\n400\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.700\nSo here we are.\n\n401\n00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.510\nWe're able now to find out that the status\nof this of course is gonna be full.\n\n402\n00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.520\nWhich is what we want it to be able to do,\nokay?\n\n403\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.530\nSo normally once we do that right,\nthat's fine.\n\n404\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.960\nBut this should not be the only.\n\n405\n00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.700\nOf course, why would it do that?\n\n406\n00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.600\nThis should not be the only place where\nwe can find out this information.\n\n407\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.530\nBut it is a nice place, cuz it's nice and\nshrunken if I'm looking for\n\n408\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.840\nthat specific piece of information.\n\n409\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.390\nBut there are times though,\nwhich you'll actually end up doing.\n\n410\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:06.350\nBecause it's more natural for us, because\nwe will do this command quite often.\n\n411\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.820\nWhich is just show that interface.\n\n412\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.164\nFast ethernet, one, slash,\nzero, slash, one [SOUND].\n\n413\n00:21:14.164 --> 00:21:17.143\nSo we've done this particular\ncommand prior from the very one,\n\n414\n00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:18.880\nthe very first ones that we did.\n\n415\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.690\nIn any of our practice labs\nwhich is to show that interface.\n\n416\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.850\nBecause I did a reminder,\nI was, show running dash.\n\n417\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:30.740\nConfig is pretty much the entire\nconfiguration of that router, that switch.\n\n418\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.380\nAnd that's where you gonna find\nall the answers normally, right?\n\n419\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.780\nWhen you start doing that.\n\n420\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.230\nSo once something like\nthat ends up happening,\n\n421\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.890\nokay, this is where you you'll\nget a lot of information.\n\n422\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.620\nNow Daniel in what we're seeing\nhere on the screen though,\n\n423\n00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.690\non this particular interface, right?\n\n424\n00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.110\nOkay, it shows me a lot of information.\n\n425\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.040\nBut if I need to determine\nthe duplex speed.\n\n426\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.490\nThat's a lot of data to just\nhave to filter through.\n\n427\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.490\nAnd if I'm under a time constraint,\nI may miss it.\n\n428\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.400\n&gt;&gt; So my advice of read slowly and\n\n429\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.380\nthoroughly might not be the best idea\nif you're in an exam situation, right?\n\n430\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:04.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n431\n00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.120\nSo that's what you have to do,\nyou need to take a look at this.\n\n432\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.220\nAnd if you wanna actually determine this.\n\n433\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.410\nGo line by line and\n\n434\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.770\nmake sure you can see some of the\ninformation that you're expecting to see.\n\n435\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.910\nBut it is right here that we're seeing\nsome of the same information we saw in\n\n436\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.680\nthe status as what we saw here, right?\n\n437\n00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.920\nWhere it says Full Dupluex,\n100 megabits for our speed.\n\n438\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.760\nAnd then the media type here is 10\nBASE 100-TX, which means twisted pair.\n\n439\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.740\nI know that that's copper as well.\n\n440\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.810\nSo it gives me a lot of that information.\n\n441\n00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.180\nBut, yes, this can be overwhelming\nwhen you're doing this under time.\n\n442\n00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.510\nAnd all of a sudden you're actually\nsaying, where can you find a, for\n\n443\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.040\nexample, let's say, a question is.\n\n444\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.940\nWhich of the following commands\nproduces the information you need\n\n445\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.620\nto determine the duplex?\n\n446\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.380\nWell, what if the other commands like the\nshow interface status is not there, okay?\n\n447\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.840\nWhat if the show interface capabilities\nis not there for that one.\n\n448\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.340\nBut they give you this,\nwell you know it's there.\n\n449\n00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.620\nBut do you really know it's there okay?\n\n450\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.350\nThe only way for you to know that is for\nyou to examine this.\n\n451\n00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.170\nAnd look at the output\nthat it's given you.\n\n452\n00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.530\nBecause this is really everything\nthat's on this interface.\n\n453\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.750\nAnd that should be something\nthat we shouldn't shy away from.\n\n454\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.260\nAs much as we want to go\nto show running config.\n\n455\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.510\nI can find everything I want\nto just about It's right here.\n\n456\n00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.370\nMake sure you examine the output for\n\n457\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:24.100\nthis particular show message is what\nyou want to also be able to do as well.\n\n458\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:24.800\nOkay?\n\n459\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.580\nSo that's what we want to make\nsure that we can set up here.\n\n460\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.210\nNow, let's go ahead and do this as well.\n\n461\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.820\nNow that we've got both sides\nbeing set to auto, right?\n\n462\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.080\nWhat if we go ahead and change one\nside of the duplex configuration for\n\n463\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.509\nwhat we want here and see what happens.\n\n464\n00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:47.617\nSo on the other end of\nFa1/0/1 is going to be\n\n465\n00:23:47.617 --> 00:23:52.870\nthe router that I connected\nto just a moment ago.\n\n466\n00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:57.853\nWhich is NYEDGE and it is connected\nto that interface that you see\n\n467\n00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:02.027\nwhich is interfacegigabitethernet0/0,\nokay?\n\n468\n00:24:02.027 --> 00:24:07.770\nSo what if I change the configuration on\nthis side, well what should end up happen?\n\n469\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.050\nWell, let's go ahead and\ntest that one out as well.\n\n470\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.430\nSo let me get in to our\nglobal configuration.\n\n471\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.651\nAnd once I'm in there, I want to get into\n\n472\n00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:25.318\ninterface gigabit ethernet 0/0 and now,\n\n473\n00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:31.910\nwe are ready to start changing\nthe actual duplex here.\n\n474\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.410\nType in the work duplex and let's do a\nquestion mark if you don't know what other\n\n475\n00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:40.430\noptions that you have or\nother modifiers that you need.\n\n476\n00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.650\nSo it is right here that\nyou see where the duplex.\n\n477\n00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.410\nAnd we know what the default is,\nwhich is auto, okay?\n\n478\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.080\nEnable auto duplex configuration.\n\n479\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.280\nWell, we already saw what happens\nwhen we enable auto, right?\n\n480\n00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.120\nIt defaulted to 100 megabits\ncuz that's what it tries to do.\n\n481\n00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.760\nIt tries to negotiate at the highest\nspeed that it can on the other device.\n\n482\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.970\nAnd it says, all right, the other side is\nsaying that it can run at a hundred, so\n\n483\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.610\nthis side will also in theory,\nalso run at a hundred too.\n\n484\n00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.710\nBut what if I set this\nthing at two instead half?\n\n485\n00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.940\nSo this would be duplex half.\n\n486\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.220\nNow that we see that and we set it.\n\n487\n00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.390\nWe're not getting any messages\nthat's coming across.\n\n488\n00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.620\nWe're actually getting a down state.\n\n489\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.650\nWe're changing that, so\nits like something changed.\n\n490\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:27.390\nSo let me kind of toggle this interface\nand do what I need to do here.\n\n491\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.570\nBut the reason why nothing\nhas kind of fallen apart,\n\n492\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.930\neven though the other side said it\nwas what 100 megabytes or not 100,\n\n493\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.945\nfull as far as the auto-configuration,\nright?\n\n494\n00:25:37.945 --> 00:25:40.430\nA-full is what we saw on the switch.\n\n495\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.980\nNow we've hard set this to half.\n\n496\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.330\nWell, what should happen, right,\nis on the switch side, it did say what,\n\n497\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:48.930\nauto at the beginning.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.620\n&gt;&gt; So now if we go back to the NYCORE1.\n\n499\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.620\nAnd now we do the show interface.\n\n500\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.930\nLet's do a status here.\n\n501\n00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.400\nIt's show instead of how.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Interface status, that's me.\n\n503\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.070\nNow I scroll back up just a little bit.\n\n504\n00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.900\nLook at this Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; Now it's showing half.\n\n505\n00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Now it's showing half.\n\n506\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.780\n&gt;&gt; And that's because of the auto\n\n507\n00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.420\nis still set on one side.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n508\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.050\nSo as long as the auto is set on side,\nwhatever the other side is or\n\n509\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.100\nyou set it to whatever,\nit should match up and we should be fine.\n\n510\n00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.700\nWe should be ready to go\nas we start doing this.\n\n511\n00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.190\nSo the duplex setting allows\nus to be able to do that.\n\n512\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:40.670\nNow, now that the other side though\nis hard set, right, to half.\n\n513\n00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.870\nWhat happens now if we\ntake NYCORE1 here and\n\n514\n00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.090\nwe change the duplex setting on this side?\n\n515\n00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:52.760\nSo let's go into Global Configuration Mode\nand then into Interface FA.\n\n516\n00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:57.870\n1/0/1.\n\n517\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.710\nAnd now I do a duplex again.\n\n518\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.160\nI'm gonna do a question mark.\n\n519\n00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.680\nI always like seeing it.\n\n520\n00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.810\nCuz just in case there is some syntax\ndifference, there normally isn't gonna\n\n521\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:12.080\nbe in a Cisco IOS whether it's on a switch\nor a router it should be identical.\n\n522\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.370\nAlways say should.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Should be identical.\n\n524\n00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.750\nSometimes you may see a little bit more on\none device versus another one but usually,\n\n525\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.320\nit should be identical here.\n\n526\n00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.530\nSo duplex and then this time,\n\n527\n00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.960\nlet's set this one instead that\nwe get a duplex mismatch to full.\n\n528\n00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.840\nAll right so\n\n529\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.470\nDaniel, router is set to half.\n\n530\n00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Hard\n\n531\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.230\nset.\n&gt;&gt; Hard set.\n\n532\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.570\n&gt;&gt; Switch, I'm gonna hard set this one to\n\n533\n00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.990\nfull.\n\n534\n00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.330\nWhat do you think's gonna happen here?\n\n535\n00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.120\nAre we gonna get messages or no messages?\n&gt;&gt; I think we're gonna get some\n\n536\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.100\nmessages.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n537\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.940\n&gt;&gt; It looks like I'm already right\n\n538\n00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.631\nbecause there they come.\n\n539\n00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:45.533\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n540\n00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:50.355\nwe're starting to actually see maybe a\nlittle bit here, so let's check this out.\n\n541\n00:27:50.355 --> 00:27:51.800\nNothing exactly yet.\n&gt;&gt; Nothing crazy.\n\n542\n00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.040\n&gt;&gt; But I haven't checked on it yet.\n\n543\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.290\nLet's see here.\n\n544\n00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.640\nLet me go back over here and\nsee in just a moment,\n\n545\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.630\nwe should start getting some more messages\nthat start coming back and forth.\n\n546\n00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.300\nAt least that's what I think\nwe should be getting here.\n\n547\n00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.490\nBut let's go ahead and\nstart seeing, let's see here.\n\n548\n00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.630\nWe should be getting\nsome different ones here.\n\n549\n00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.180\n&gt;&gt; The, there they are,\n\n550\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.990\nduplex mismatch, right there.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for.\n\n551\n00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.650\nI had to exit, for one reason or\nanother it's like I'm just gonna hold onto\n\n552\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.540\nthe information til\nyou're ready to see it.\n\n553\n00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.240\nSo there we go.\n\n554\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.580\nWe are starting to get some\nduplex mismatches and here,\n\n555\n00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.350\nyou're seeing that message, right?\n\n556\n00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.980\nThis is a CDP message which\nis Cisco Discovery Protocol.\n\n557\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.850\nWe're gonna have the,\n\n558\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.955\nwhere we're gonna talk about what this\nactually means a little bit later on.\n\n559\n00:28:33.955 --> 00:28:38.470\nIt's level four message and then of\ncourse the message is DUPLEX MISMATCH.\n\n560\n00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.350\nNow the nice thing about this\nparticular syslog message,\n\n561\n00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:45.760\nright, is that it really does\ntell you what the error is, okay?\n\n562\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.759\nDUPLEX MISMATCH discovered on this\ninterface with NY Edge 1, okay,\n\n563\n00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:55.520\non gigabit ethernet 0/0\nwhich is set to half duplex.\n\n564\n00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.390\nSo on this one, it is trying to allow\nus to see and to understand and\n\n565\n00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.670\nto know what is happening here.\n\n566\n00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.000\nSo that it's actually seeing\nthat duplex mismatch.\n\n567\n00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.510\nSo it's going to continue to\nreport that duplex mismatch.\n\n568\n00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.560\nIf I go back up to NY Edge 1\nwhich is on the other side,\n\n569\n00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.860\nI am now also giving those messages to.\n\n570\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.560\nSo here, we can do this instead.\n\n571\n00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:26.120\nSince I'm still on the interface, let\nme go ahead and set the duplex to full.\n\n572\n00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.250\nSo I have two options here Daniel.\n\n573\n00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.630\nI could just set it back to auto, okay?\n\n574\n00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.680\nAnd that should work.\n\n575\n00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.350\nWe'd be perfectly fine with that.\n\n576\n00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.320\nEverything would be fine and\nwe could do that.\n\n577\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.950\nOr I could hard set it just\nlike I did here to full.\n\n578\n00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:43.730\nSo the, there's a couple of reasons\nwhy you'd do one or the other.\n\n579\n00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.920\nIf you absolutely are trouble shooting and\n\n580\n00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.030\nyou're 100% trouble shooting,\nset both sides to full, hard set up.\n\n581\n00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.740\nOkay but\nif you have tis notion at some point.\n\n582\n00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.250\nYou're going to be taking\nthis interface and\n\n583\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.040\nmultiple devices are going\nto be plugged into it.\n\n584\n00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.110\nYou don't know what the speed is,\nyou don't know what it could be.\n\n585\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.670\nThen set it back to auto.\n\n586\n00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.670\nBut if you're troubleshooting,\nhard set both sides, okay?\n\n587\n00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.290\nSo that's not a, it's not a CISCO rule but\nit's a good rule of thumb-.\n\n588\n00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.000\n&gt;&gt; Just a good rule to and\n\n589\n00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.900\npracticuum, right.\n\n590\n00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.920\nWe don't like to give you\njust the book knowledge that\n\n591\n00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.800\nyou can, just to-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n592\n00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.340\n&gt;&gt; Pass, pass the test.\n\n593\n00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.370\nThis will help you out in the real world\nscenario, which very well might happen.\n\n594\n00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz if you think,\n\n595\n00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.730\neven in most devices should\nbe 100% full duplexing.\n\n596\n00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.390\nThere's no guarantee that if,\nI know that this isn't a switch but\n\n597\n00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.040\nlet's say it was a switch and\nyou hard set it to full.\n\n598\n00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.010\nAnd then you bring in another device,\nthough.\n\n599\n00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:37.500\nAnd that other device only\ncommunicates half duplex.\n\n600\n00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.660\nIt's gonna tell you that there's\na duplex missing [INAUDIBLE].\n\n601\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.580\nWhy did I set this thing to full?\n\n602\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.080\nWhy did I hard set it?\n&gt;&gt; Of course, then,\n\n603\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.590\nyou hard set it to half duplex or\nwhatever that device is.\n\n604\n00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.496\nAnd then you plug something else in and\nit's duplex mismatch.\n\n605\n00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:49.570\n&gt;&gt; So, in production, right,\n\n606\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:55.360\nif you know I'm not troubleshooting here\nand it was hard set, set it back to auto.\n\n607\n00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.770\nAnd then you're ready to go but\n\n608\n00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.230\nif you ever suspect there's\nan interface issue of any type and\n\n609\n00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.160\nyou're saying, it could be a duplex\nmismatch, set both sides to what you need.\n\n610\n00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.530\nAnd that's what we want\nto also be able to do.\n\n611\n00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.980\nAll right Daniel, so\nin this particular segment,\n\n612\n00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.290\nwe did get to the idea of actually seeing\nthe duplex settings and how that works.\n\n613\n00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.910\nWe now need to move on to speed.\n\n614\n00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.760\nBut Daniel, I've run out of time for\nthis segment.\n\n615\n00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.450\nSo that means we are ready to move on.\n\n616\n00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.980\nBut we will do it in another episode.\n&gt;&gt; That clock is a fickle friend everyone.\n\n617\n00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.390\nIt goes so fast.\n\n618\n00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.670\nBut not to worry we can just make\n\n619\n00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.330\nanother episode.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n620\n00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.120\n&gt;&gt; That's what we do here.\n\n621\n00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.170\nRonnie I look forward to seeing you then.\n\n622\n00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.610\nAnd I'm looking forward to seeing\nyou good folks there as well.\n\n623\n00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.210\nBut it is that time for\nus to call it a day.\n\n624\n00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.380\nSigning off for IT Pro TV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n625\n00:31:35.380 -->

00:00:08.275\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:11.847\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:13.739\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.610\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.790\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.120\nin today's episode it's back\nwith more in our CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.920\nAnd joining us yet again our good friend,\none Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.450\nRonnie?\n\n11\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.610\nWelcome back how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.490\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel,\nthank you for having me back as we\n\n13\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.130\ncontinue on in taking a look of\ncourse not only at the CCENT, but\n\n14\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.020\nalso of course specifically today we are\ncontinuing on into part 2 on our lab here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.780\nTalking of course about some\nof the different interface and\n\n16\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.450\ncabling considerations as\nwell as troubleshooting.\n\n17\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.450\nThings that we want to know about too.\n\n18\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.608\nSo in a previous episode,\n\n19\n00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:51.930\nthe part 1 of this, we spent a lot of time\njust talking about the idea of duplexing.\n\n20\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.060\nAnd today we're moving on to speed and\nof course,\n\n21\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.480\neven the cabling side\na little bit as well.\n\n22\n00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.050\nWe'll be taking a look at some of the\ninformation that we'll see when we start\n\n23\n00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.750\nlooking at the interface commands and\ntrying to point those out to you.\n\n24\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.840\nSo let's go ahead and get started here.\n\n25\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.450\nOn my machine,\nI brought up NYCORE1 again okay.\n\n26\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.860\nAnd so this machine is going to help\nus to establish what we've done.\n\n27\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.410\nWe've already taken a look of\ncourse at setting the duplex,\n\n28\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.590\nhalf duplex versus full duplex.\n\n29\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.330\nWe saw duplex mismatches.\n\n30\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.860\nNow we want to get into a setting,\nof course,\n\n31\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.940\nof speed here of what we want, so\nlet's go ahead and run this here.\n\n32\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.920\nFirst thing I'm going to do is\nI'm gonna type in a command here,\n\n33\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.230\nshow interface, and\nthis time it will be on fa0/2.\n\n34\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.840\nThen I'm gonna do fastethernet\n\n35\n00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.550\nand it's gonna be 1/0/2 and\ntalk about capabilities here.\n\n36\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.680\nNow in between time of our break, between\nthe first episode and the second episode.\n\n37\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.115\nSomebody did ask in the chat,\nis this command always available.\n\n38\n00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.025\nWell, it's available but you might find\nespecially if you have older equipment\n\n39\n00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:01.485\nthat it may not be available.\n\n40\n00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:03.605\nSo I do need to point that out,\n\n41\n00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:08.095\nthat if your particular machine\ndoesn't have this particular command\n\n42\n00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:13.370\nwhere it gives you the ability to type\nin capabilities you just won't have it.\n\n43\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.310\nSo normally when there is something\nin that disparity, especially for\n\n44\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.840\nthe exam, they'll pick the one\nthat will be common for everyone.\n\n45\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.790\nSo instead, more than likely the command\nthat you'll end up seeing where you can\n\n46\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.660\npretty much get at least\nthe information we're looking for,\n\n47\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.860\nis gonna be the first part of that\ncommand without the capabilities here.\n\n48\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.110\nBut on this one we can see by\nthe interface the same information that\n\n49\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.760\nwe can see, but now actually listing all\nof the possibilities in interfaces and\n\n50\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.340\ntoday we are talking\nabout of course speed.\n\n51\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.070\nSo when we take a look at the idea\nof speed, right, 10, 100, auto.\n\n52\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.900\nBoth 10 and\n100 then can be manually hard set and\n\n53\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.120\nyou know, that means that the interface\ncan send and receive at 10 megabits, or\n\n54\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.350\nsend and receive at 100 megabits.\n\n55\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.370\nAnd then of course there\nis that idea of auto again.\n\n56\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.750\nAnd auto is exactly like it sounds like,\n\n57\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.820\nit will negotiate with\nwhatever the other side says.\n\n58\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.930\nSo if the other side is hard set to 100,\n\n59\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.780\nthis side will also negotiate 2,\nwell 100 as well.\n\n60\n00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.780\nAnd the other side is set to ten,\nthey will also negotiate to ten.\n\n61\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.400\nSo that makes sense and\nwe've seen this in the same way\n\n62\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.120\nthat we saw the idea of the duplex\nsettings getting set up in that way.\n\n63\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.860\nSo now let's take a look\na little bit more here and\n\n64\n00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.020\nlet's try to use some of our filtering\nsettings that we know about.\n\n65\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.840\nSo we'll do this show status command here,\nshow interface status.\n\n66\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.092\nThis time let's go ahead and\nput it into a certain order here so\n\n67\n00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:45.727\nI'm gonna use the pipe command.\n\n68\n00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:53.180\nI'm gonna tell it to include and\nthis is gonna be 1/0/2.\n\n69\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.790\nI'll press enter, and\nit doesn't really filter out a ton.\n\n70\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.950\nBut what you're seeing here is\nit'll give you anything that has\n\n71\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.410\nessentially filtering out\neverything like ten, right?\n\n72\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.710\nIf you see that one is\nactually filtering out.\n\n73\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.340\nBut notice it,\nit actually has 20 through 24 here.\n\n74\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.700\nAs well as gigabit 1/0/2 as well.\n\n75\n00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.148\nSo it gives us that and\nit eliminates everything but\n\n76\n00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:23.100\nthose that have like the number two and\nthat third number there.\n\n77\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.350\nSo with this one let's take a look at\nnow the speed setting here too and\n\n78\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.620\nwhat we are focusing in on like I\nsaid is gonna be this idea of speed.\n\n79\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.670\nNotice again, connected, and\nnow it's actually the a-100.\n\n80\n00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.900\nSo we know that means that it\nwas automatic at some point.\n\n81\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.790\nBut then it went to 100,\nit negotiated it at 100.\n\n82\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.995\nIf we don't have anything set,\n\n83\n00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:51.644\nwe can see by a default where this is\nnot connected on Fa1/0/20, excuse me.\n\n84\n00:04:51.644 --> 00:04:55.201\nWe'll actually see where\neverything is set to auto,\n\n85\n00:04:55.201 --> 00:05:00.259\nwhich is perfectly fine for us, but\nthis is how we know it's been negotiated\n\n86\n00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.706\nfrom automatic to 100 as well and\nit also will end up doing that.\n\n87\n00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:08.670\nIf both sides are set to auto on\nthe speed it will try and negotiate and\n\n88\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.850\nsettle at the highest\npossible speed it can.\n\n89\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.210\nSo we'll also end up seeing information\nlike that happen as well, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.240\nSo this actually does give us that setting\nthat we can do, and we can determine that.\n\n91\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.180\nSo it's not exactly difficult.\n\n92\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.440\nIt really does run just about\nthe same gamut as what we saw\n\n93\n00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.340\nwith the duplex settings to do this.\n\n94\n00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.950\nThere are times when you can end up\nhaving speed mismatches that will happen,\n\n95\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.870\nand that's something we also\nneed to talk about, too.\n\n96\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.130\nSo, what happens here when\nsomething like this happens.\n\n97\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.130\nWell, usually, it's because we've\nchanged one device or another.\n\n98\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.380\nSo for example, Daniel, it may be where,\nwhat I've done is I've stuck with like\n\n99\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.530\nan older switch that's only fast ethernet,\nevery single port is fast ethernet here.\n\n100\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.540\nBut at some point because we realized that\nwe needed to upgrade our router because we\n\n101\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.190\nhad more networks coming in, we might\nhave actually upgraded the router and\n\n102\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.650\nit went from a fast ethernet\nport to a gigabit port.\n\n103\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Hmm\n&gt;&gt; So we may end up seeing that where if\n\n104\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.290\nthat port on that gigabit side\nis set to auto and it's default\n\n105\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.690\nwas actually to default to the highest\nspeed it can, it may just say look,\n\n106\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:23.390\nnow I have 1,000 megabits, and the fastest\nthat this thing can go is 100 megabits.\n\n107\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.410\nWell does that cause any issues when\nwe start seeing something like that?\n\n108\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.440\nSo let's check this particular\nsetting out instead.\n\n109\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.620\nSo we're doing duplex we were using 1/0/1,\nthis time we're gonna\n\n110\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.500\nconnect to NYWAN1 instead\noff of Fa1/0/2 instead,\n\n111\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.070\nand let's see on the other side\nwhat this one's connected to.\n\n112\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.100\nSo if I click on the NYWAN1\nover on the left-hand side,\n\n113\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.420\nthat should bring me to that router.\n\n114\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.340\nAnd on this router, what we want to do,\nof course, is show our interface here.\n\n115\n00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:05.410\nAnd let's see what we see,\nif I can actually get it in there.\n\n116\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.650\nPress enter a couple of times.\n\n117\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.910\nLet me try it one more time.\n\n118\n00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.040\nI'm getting moved off of this thing,\nand then let's try it.\n\n119\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.860\nThere we go, found it.\n\n120\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.030\nIt actually allowed me to type now, so\nI'm doing, well maybe, doing good here.\n\n121\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.719\nThere we go.\n[SOUND]\n\n122\n00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:25.377\n&gt;&gt; You can do it, Ronnie.\n\n123\n00:07:25.377 --> 00:07:26.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n124\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.600\nAll right.\n\n125\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.320\nSo yeah every once in\na while you'll get stuck.\n\n126\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.190\nI don't know it's because\nI'm moving between them.\n\n127\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.590\nBut it does get stuck,\njust be a little bit patient.\n\n128\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.570\nUnlike me, I'm not exactly the most\npatient person in the world.\n\n129\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.150\n&gt;&gt; Plus you got a camera staring at you.\n\n130\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.440\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we'll do a show interface.\n\n131\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.928\nAnd this one, remember gigabit instead.\n\n132\n00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:53.709\nSo gigabitethernet, making sure I\nspell that correctly if I can here.\n\n133\n00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:56.294\nAnd this is gonna be 0/0,\n\n134\n00:07:56.294 --> 00:08:01.582\nlet's take a look at all\nthe information that we see here.\n\n135\n00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:06.002\nOkay, so at this point when we take a look\nat that information, just the default of\n\n136\n00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:10.790\nwhat it's telling us, I need to determine\nnow the speed setting that I have.\n\n137\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.970\nAnd what I can see here\nis right next to Duplex,\n\n138\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.530\neven though I did type\nin what Daniel here?\n\n139\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.900\n&gt;&gt; Gigabit ethernet.\n\n140\n00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.677\n&gt;&gt; It is\n&gt;&gt; Only 100 megabits per second.\n\n141\n00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:23.366\n&gt;&gt; Only 100 megabits per second, so\n\n142\n00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:27.040\nthis is one of those things that can\ndrive you a little bit nuts, right?\n\n143\n00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.170\nLet's say that we absolutely upgraded,\nokay?\n\n144\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.860\nThis router, because we knew it\nhad gigabit ports on it, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.900\n&gt;&gt; Like buying a Ferrari,\nand the pedal for\n\n146\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.850\nthe gas only goes down a third of the way,\nright?\n\n147\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n148\n00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:39.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a tenth of the way.\n\n149\n00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.107\n&gt;&gt; Tenth of the way.\n\n150\n00:08:40.107 --> 00:08:40.881\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n151\n00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:43.080\nthat's what we're seeing here, right?\n\n152\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.510\nIs that one side, it is set to,\nwell now that Ferrari is set\n\n153\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.850\nto well 100 mega,\n1/10 of a gig of its speed.\n\n154\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:58.460\nAnd that is something that we don't want\nto end up seeing but we may have to, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.740\nUntil we can upgrade or until we actually\nmove it to one of those gigabit ports.\n\n156\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.230\nThen make that connection be a little bit\ndifferent at this point if we wanted to.\n\n157\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.530\nSo let's change this.\n\n158\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.700\nLet's hard set this thing and see what\nhappens on the auto-negotiation, right?\n\n159\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.820\nWe know that the switch is\nset to auto-negotiate, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.610\nSo what will happen if we just say,\nall right, let's do this?\n\n161\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.451\nLet's not do this side and\nput it at auto anymore.\n\n162\n00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:27.387\nLet's set this thing to\nthe full gigabyte speed that it\n\n163\n00:09:27.387 --> 00:09:30.260\ncan actually run and do that.\n\n164\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.140\nAll right, so let me see what I\ncan click in here and try and\n\n165\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.410\nget us away from this here.\n\n166\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.920\nLet's go into our global configuration.\n\n167\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:48.704\nAnd then, interface gigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n168\n00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:54.828\nAnd now we'll do speed Is what will take.\n\n169\n00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:59.760\nSo now we have of course 10,\n100, 1000 perfectly fine.\n\n170\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.920\nWe know that auto is the default\nof what we can see here.\n\n171\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.130\nSo that's perfectly good as well.\n\n172\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.040\nAt this time, if I typed in speed.\n\n173\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.540\nAnd let's do 1000, at this point.\n\n174\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.810\nSo now that I've got that hard set.\n\n175\n00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.680\nRight, there it is,\nthe interface is going up and down.\n\n176\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.210\nSaying hey, something has changed\non this interface, let's make sure,\n\n177\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.140\nit takes place.\n\n178\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.450\nTurn it off, turn it back on and\nlet's see what starts to happen.\n\n179\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.713\nSo now, we've got that setting.\n\n180\n00:10:28.713 --> 00:10:31.979\nShow interface gigabit,\n\n181\n00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:40.820\nEthernet 0/0, What did I type in?\n\n182\n00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.805\n&gt;&gt; Do show [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:10:41.805 --> 00:10:45.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm on it, I'm at the wrong\nprompt is what happened here.\n\n184\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.286\nYeah, I should have done do show.\n\n185\n00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:55.500\nShow interface gigabitethernet.\n\n186\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.666\nMove it better that time hopefully.\n\n187\n00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:01.903\nAll right, so\n\n188\n00:11:01.903 --> 00:11:08.220\nthe great thing is auto duplex perfectly\nfine It is now hard set to one gigabit.\n\n189\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.111\nSo Daniel, do you think that that core\nswitch that we were on, okay, right here.\n\n190\n00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:19.095\nWhat do we have the possibility of, right?\n\n191\n00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.215\nCould it, actually have said all right,\nI see a 1,000, let's go for\n\n192\n00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:23.315\na 1,000, let's try.\n\n193\n00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:26.315\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it has gigabit\ncapabilities then yes it would,\n\n194\n00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:28.835\nand it's set to auto,\nit would definitely attempt to do that.\n\n195\n00:11:28.835 --> 00:11:31.810\nAnd if successful, out of thing you're\nrunning out of gigabit speeds and\n\n196\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.300\nall is well in the world.\n\n197\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.022\nBut if it can't run at a 1,000,\nit's probably gonna default to its highest\n\n198\n00:11:38.022 --> 00:11:41.435\navailable speed and\nthen some weirdness is gonna happen.\n\n199\n00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:46.304\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what you'll see here, so\n\n200\n00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:49.045\nfastethernet 1/0/2.\n\n201\n00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:50.070\nHopefully, I've typed that in right.\n\n202\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.540\nAnd now let's see here.\n\n203\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.690\nAnd the moment of truth.\n\n204\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.890\nLet's see what the set.\n\n205\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.850\nLook at that Daniel.\n\n206\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.970\nIt actually says auto speed.\n\n207\n00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.105\nNow, what the heck is auto speed?\n\n208\n00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:07.100\n[LAUGH] Yeah, that now begins to get\na little bit trickier when you start to-\n\n209\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.818\n&gt;&gt; That's a little less-\n\n210\n00:12:07.818 --> 00:12:09.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not exact.\n\n211\n00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:09.813\n&gt;&gt; Clear, yeah.\n\n212\n00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.325\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, less clear here.\n\n213\n00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:13.460\n&gt;&gt; So, let's see,\nwhat's another command then that may help?\n\n214\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.030\nLet's do the one that showed us\na lot of information, right.\n\n215\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:21.420\nSo, let's do that show\ninterface status again,\n\n216\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.300\nand we'll do the include, and\nwe'll do 1/0/2 just to help us to filter\n\n217\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.940\nout little bit more, and\nat this particular point, no, Daniel.\n\n218\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.400\nIt doesn't look like it's\nreally showing us anything.\n\n219\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.810\nSo this is where we are gonna have\nthis unusual mismatch of things\n\n220\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.410\nthat's not gonna actually\nshow us anything.\n\n221\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.790\nIt's just saying look,\nI'm negotiating whatever I can negotiate.\n\n222\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.080\nNow, will it work?\n\n223\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.620\nYes, you can do this, and\npeople do this all the time.\n\n224\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.750\nBut remember that, what you're really\neffectively doing, is what Daniel said.\n\n225\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.110\nIt is taking the port,\nthat operates at a 1000 megabits.\n\n226\n00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.885\nAnd if you're connecting\nit to a fast ethernet port,\n\n227\n00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:04.290\nthe fast this is gonna work is\ngoing to be a 100 megabits.\n\n228\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.670\nThere is just no possibility for\nit to be able to reach 1,000.\n\n229\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if the port can't do gigabit\nspeeds, it can't do gigabit speeds.\n\n230\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.130\nIt can only do what it can do.\n\n231\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.500\n&gt;&gt; So remember, and there's two options in\ntroubleshooting here on this point, right?\n\n232\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.550\nEither this needs to be moved off\nto this gigabit port down here.\n\n233\n00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.520\nAnd the great thing is,\nit does show me some.\n\n234\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.970\nIt is available, right?\n\n235\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.050\nThe not connected at this point,\nand it's not present.\n\n236\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.200\nBut the problem that we have here\non this is that it's probably that\n\n237\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.650\nspecial SPF port.\n\n238\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.237\nSo unless the router also has\na gigabit SPF port on there,\n\n239\n00:13:36.237 --> 00:13:40.272\nthen we'd have to get some converter\nthat ties it back down, and\n\n240\n00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:45.204\nthat does everything else we need to\nconvert it to an RJ-45 connection, and\n\n241\n00:13:45.204 --> 00:13:50.245\nnow you've just spent 70, 100 maybe\na couple hundred dollars to do that.\n\n242\n00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:50.991\n&gt;&gt; SFP.\n\n243\n00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:52.670\n&gt;&gt; SFP, yeah, small form plugable.\n\n244\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.671\n&gt;&gt; It's 30 SPF but\nit's still small form plugable [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:56.008\n&gt;&gt; Well that's me, I'll tell you.\n\n246\n00:13:56.008 --> 00:14:00.072\n&gt;&gt; It's protective from the sun, and\ngives you gigabit speed, that's great.\n\n247\n00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:03.121\n&gt;&gt; That is the worst acronym ever,\nyeah, I'll put.\n\n248\n00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:04.155\n&gt;&gt; And it kills you doesn't it every time.\n\n249\n00:14:04.155 --> 00:14:06.427\n&gt;&gt; It does and\nI've been doing this for ten years and\n\n250\n00:14:06.427 --> 00:14:07.880\nit kills me every single time.\n\n251\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.410\n&gt;&gt; It's just one of those things trust me.\n\n252\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.747\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; On the same prompt with Mac OS.\n\n254\n00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:13.526\n&gt;&gt; Ywah.\n&gt;&gt; We worked with it for years and\n\n255\n00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:16.000\nstill have trouble with Y command or\noption.\n\n256\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What's the difference?\n\n257\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.420\nNow, when you do, I always look down and\nsay I pressed the wrong one again.\n\n258\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.860\nThat's also gets me too.\n\n259\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.600\nBut that's one of those things that\nyou do have to think about, right.\n\n260\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.730\nIf they needed full gigabit on both ends,\n\n261\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.610\nyou need make sure that both ends\nhave a gigabit port on them.\n\n262\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.820\nIt can negotiate, it will negotiate but\nwhat it does is really and\n\n263\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.320\nthis side is just saying well even\nthough the other side says a 1,000.\n\n264\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.830\nI'm gonna negotiate as high as I can and\nwe'll work what we can do there.\n\n265\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.500\nSo there's not real a lot\nof fix here on this.\n\n266\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.500\nSo the ideal though,\n\n267\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.810\nis that both sides would actually work\nat what speeds that we want it to work.\n\n268\n00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.880\nAnd the way that we do that again\nin troubleshooting is setting both\n\n269\n00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.260\nsides manually.\n\n270\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.340\nSo on this side if we go back\nin to our global configuration.\n\n271\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.760\nInterface Fa I gotta remember to be good.\n\n272\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.720\nF, I.\n\n273\n00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.713\nI want to so badly-\n&gt;&gt; This would be [CROSSTALK]\n\n274\n00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:14.980\n&gt;&gt; I know, I do.\n\n275\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.240\nI really do, but I'm gonna be good here.\n\n276\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.022\nAnd then speed.\n\n277\n00:15:18.022 --> 00:15:18.887\n&gt;&gt; You're a better man than me Ronnie.\n\n278\n00:15:18.887 --> 00:15:21.690\n&gt;&gt; Speed, let's set it at ten.\n\n279\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.710\nWhich would be insane.\n\n280\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.680\nYou would never want to do this to\na gigabit port but let's do this for\n\n281\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.948\nthe sake of trying to be good here.\n\n282\n00:15:30.948 --> 00:15:36.012\n[LAUGH] gigabitethernet 0/0, and\n\n283\n00:15:36.012 --> 00:15:40.950\nthen we'll do speed ten as well.\n\n284\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.030\nAnd that should do everything\nthat we need it to, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.859\nSo in trouble shooting, okay,\nonce again, it still actually comes and\n\n286\n00:15:48.859 --> 00:15:50.530\ntells us what we need to.\n\n287\n00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.596\nAnd allows us to ensure that we have both\nsides set the way that we wanted to.\n\n288\n00:15:54.596 --> 00:15:57.623\nAnd that should be just about\neverything that we need here, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.787\nOnce we do that.\n\n290\n00:15:58.787 --> 00:15:59.401\nAll right.\n\n291\n00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:01.023\nNow that we've got that set up here.\n\n292\n00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:01.947\nOkay.\n\n293\n00:16:01.947 --> 00:16:06.437\nWe now need to talk about some of\nthe information we're seeing over\n\n294\n00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:10.770\nhere on this show interfaces\ncommand that we've been looking at\n\n295\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.430\njust a little bit earlier here as well.\n\n296\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.960\nLet me see what I can scroll over and\nscroll up.\n\n297\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.370\nI can't of course.\n\n298\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.250\nLet's just run that command again.\n\n299\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:25.194\nSo back on NY[CORE1].\n\n300\n00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:30.138\nGet out of there and then do a show\n\n301\n00:16:30.138 --> 00:16:36.191\ninterface Fast Ethernet 1/0/2.\n\n302\n00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:40.843\nSo we're gonna point out just a few other\nthings again because you need to be very\n\n303\n00:16:40.843 --> 00:16:41.607\nfamiliar and\n\n304\n00:16:41.607 --> 00:16:46.725\nvery comfortable in the output that is\nshown here from this command as well.\n\n305\n00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:50.265\nWhat we're gonna specifically look at\nis because it shows us this on a per\n\n306\n00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:52.500\ninterface basis is, well,\n\n307\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.180\nthe information that we see, well, down\nhere that shows us errors and stuff, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.470\nSo let's review, once again,\n\n309\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.755\nonce you start seeing this\ntype of information, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:02.196\nSo the idea of runts,\n\n311\n00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:07.250\nthis is gonna be smaller than what\na normal ethernet frame would be.\n\n312\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:13.460\nSo when you see something like this,\nless than 64 bytes is what you're seeing.\n\n313\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.930\nAnd normally, the cause of this, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.640\nWhen you start seeing runts\nare collisions that end up happening.\n\n315\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.630\nSo when you end up seeing runts here,\nokay?\n\n316\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.850\nAnd you start seeing that, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:31.340\nYou should also see then\ncollisions happening too, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.240\nWhen you start seeing runts.\n\n319\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.650\nNow, if you kind of remember back when we\nfirst started talking about the switching\n\n320\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:41.690\nconcepts, we talked about\nmicrosegmentation and\n\n321\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.400\nthat really just about\neliminating all collisions.\n\n322\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.190\nSo when you start seeing\nsomething like this,\n\n323\n00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.640\nit also might mean that there is going\nto be some type of setting that you and\n\n324\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.530\nI just went over, whether it's speed or\nduplex settings that have caused this.\n\n325\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.320\nSo, expect that if you see runts, you're\nalso more than likely to see the idea of\n\n326\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.600\ncollisions happening here, as well.\n\n327\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.180\nWhen do collisions tend to happen?\n\n328\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.100\nCollisions tend to happen when\nwe start transmitting and\n\n329\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.010\nreceiving on the same set of wires.\n\n330\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.310\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; We've discussed this ad nauseum I\n\n331\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.880\nwanna say.\n\n332\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.927\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we absolutely did.\n\n333\n00:18:18.927 --> 00:18:19.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so when\n\n334\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.350\nyou start seeing something like this,\nright?\n\n335\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.980\nIt's because that's exactly\nwhat's happening here.\n\n336\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.860\nSo Daniel, we know of at least one setting\nthat we have configured at least in this\n\n337\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.870\nepisode or the episode,\nI think it's episode four on duplexing.\n\n338\n00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Where\n\n339\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.670\nwe talked about it\nactually transmitting and\n\n340\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.182\nreceiving on one set of wires\n&gt;&gt; So if we start thinking about that,\n\n341\n00:18:38.182 --> 00:18:40.640\na duplex mismatch\n\n342\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.990\nis more than likely the cause of collision\nwe would normally see on a switch.\n\n343\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.180\nBecause what happens, right.\n\n344\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.310\nIf one side is saying, I'm sending and\ntransmitting on one set of wires.\n\n345\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.110\nAnd the other side is saying\nI'm sending one on set but\n\n346\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.338\nI'm transmitting on the other one.\n\n347\n00:18:54.338 --> 00:18:58.622\nWell that means both sides have a chance\nat what sending exactly on that one set.\n\n348\n00:18:58.622 --> 00:19:00.867\nAt any one time causing\ncollisions to happen.\n\n349\n00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:04.550\n&gt;&gt; I never would have even thought about\nthat to be honest with your Ronnie.\n\n350\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.460\nI don't tend to look for\n\n351\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.960\ncollisions on switches because\nthey're really good at avoiding them.\n\n352\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you may encounter them and\n\n353\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.910\nif you do,\nthat could be a good place to start.\n\n354\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.250\n&gt;&gt; That could be a good place to start\nwhen you start seeing this, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.810\nNow the other part of course is\nalso this idea of giants too.\n\n356\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.810\nGiants again,\nlarger than that 1500 or 1518 bytes.\n\n357\n00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.430\nOnce you start seeing that,\n\n358\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.700\nthat can also indicate that not only are\nyou having collisions and mismatches here.\n\n359\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.540\nSo you might see collisions happen but\n\n360\n00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.860\nyou might also see this idea of late\ncollisions happening too, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.660\nLarger packets coming\nthrough a bit slower.\n\n362\n00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.400\nYou name it.\n\n363\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.580\nThis can also end up happening as well.\n\n364\n00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.270\nSo those are things that will end up\n\n365\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.130\ncausing some of the gumming up of\nthe way that things should be.\n\n366\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.580\nNaturally, we don't expect to\nsee these things on switches.\n\n367\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.380\nOkay?\n\n368\n00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.130\nBut if you do have that speed and\nthat duplex type of mismatched stuff,\n\n369\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.310\nthis is when you start seeing\nthose types of things happen.\n\n370\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.980\nSo you're probably not gonna\nsee this too often anymore.\n\n371\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.910\nWhy?\nBecause that auto configuration,\n\n372\n00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.320\nit does everything.\n\n373\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.600\nIt's when we manually mis set and\n\n374\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.570\nwe get a mismatch that we\nnormally have that happening.\n\n375\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.080\nSo, as long as you kind of realize that,\n\n376\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.690\nyou probably won't see\nvery many of this happen.\n\n377\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.510\nNow, when do you see and\nmost often both sides set to auto?\n\n378\n00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.050\nIt's when you have a device set\nsending only at half duplex.\n\n379\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.590\nThat's when you'll see them\non that interface as well.\n\n380\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:35.190\nBecause it's saying look,\nI know you're transmitting on\n\n381\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.950\nthis one set and you're saying I\nshould be receiving on this other set.\n\n382\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.220\nI'm not receiving that on that,\n\n383\n00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.330\nI'm expecting to receive it on this\nside too and I'm not getting that.\n\n384\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.110\nSo if I'm not getting that,\nwell that can happen as well.\n\n385\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.320\nSo just realize that even the n device\nthat may be transmitting at a half duplex\n\n386\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.430\ncan also cause these issues too.\n\n387\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.430\nSo for us, it's one of these things that\nyou just have to pay attention to in terms\n\n388\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.520\nof some of the information\nthat you can discover.\n\n389\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.880\nNow, if you're not sure, like if this\njust looks like a glitch of some sort and\n\n390\n00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.220\nyou're not sure whether or\nnot this is recent.\n\n391\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.020\nIt might be way old.\n\n392\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.810\nWhat you can do instead is type in clear\n\n393\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.070\ncounter or counters, I have to\nremember here, let's go ahead and\n\n394\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.820\ndo a question mark because I may\nactually be typing it in wrong.\n\n395\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.360\nNope, okay, so that's right, yep.\n\n396\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.920\nIt's usually counter or\ncounters and believe it or not,\n\n397\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.220\nthat S makes a difference\nwhen you type this thing in.\n\n398\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:37.660\nSo clear counters here and\nthen we want the interface,\n\n399\n00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:43.521\nwhich is going to be fast Ethernet 1/0/2.\n\n400\n00:21:43.521 --> 00:21:47.262\nOf course, [LAUGH].\n\n401\n00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:50.352\nWhy wouldn't it?\n\n402\n00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:54.116\nFast ethernet\n\n403\n00:21:54.116 --> 00:21:59.580\n1/0/2 and now, it's saying hey,\nare you sure you want to do this.\n\n404\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.220\nSo what we're saying is what,\nI want to determine it as a recent, right.\n\n405\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.060\nSo are those numbers old or not old?\n\n406\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.190\nWell, you just go ahead and\nyou run that and that clears them all out.\n\n407\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.060\nThen you wait a certain period of time\nthat you think is gonna give you that\n\n408\n00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.420\nas you're transmitting.\n\n409\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.310\nAnd then you take a look at\nthe initial command again.\n\n410\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.640\nAnd if now they're happening,\n\n411\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.860\nit let's you know right then and\nther, tThat something is going wrong.\n\n412\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.995\nNow ours, there's nothing connected that\nwe're actually gonna cause collisions on.\n\n413\n00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:31.238\nSo we shouldn't see anything,\nI say we shouldn't but\n\n414\n00:22:31.238 --> 00:22:37.705\nlet's do interface fastethernet 1/0/2.\n\n415\n00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:41.898\nSo now that we've cleared the counters\nonce again, no runs, no collisions,\n\n416\n00:22:41.898 --> 00:22:46.190\nno late collisions you name it,\nthey're all just not there anymore.\n\n417\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.610\nSo for us, it didn't do anything but\nif you really did have a busy switch and\n\n418\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.460\nyou started looking at this and\nyou started to see that.\n\n419\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.870\nYou wanna verify that it's still\nhappening, that's the way you do it.\n\n420\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.150\nAnd they start showing up.\n\n421\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.450\nIt lets you know that that's what's\nhappening at that point, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.490\nAll right, so Daniel,\nthat kind of leads it for\n\n423\n00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.346\nus when we start dealing with the idea\nof speed and duplex issues and\n\n424\n00:23:05.346 --> 00:23:07.800\nhelping us to troubleshoot\na little bit more.\n\n425\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.100\nI've only got one other thing left for\nus to do,\n\n426\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.380\nwhich is the thing that should not\naffect us at all anymore, okay?\n\n427\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.790\nAnd it's always a should not.\n\n428\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.530\nBut when it comes down to Cisco exams,\n\n429\n00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.490\nit's not a matter of whether it should\nnot or whether it could not, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.720\nThe idea here is, do you really\nknow what should be there, okay?\n\n431\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.150\nCisco has made many strides\nat trying to make it almost,\n\n432\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.560\nI don't wanna be insulting but\ndummy proof.\n\n433\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.940\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; In terms of cabling, right?\n\n434\n00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.200\nCabling can be a bit of a hassle.\n\n435\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.280\nYou pick up a cable,\n\n436\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.190\nyou go to plug in two devices and\nyou're like, why isn't this working?\n\n437\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.730\nAnd you trouble shoot everything you can\nat layer three and then somebody goes,\n\n438\n00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.630\ndid you check the cable?\n\n439\n00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.130\nAnd then you go, no.\n\n440\n00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.920\nI didn't check the cable.\n\n441\n00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.026\n&gt;&gt; And then, you shut up.\n\n442\n00:23:52.026 --> 00:23:52.853\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n443\n00:23:52.853 --> 00:23:54.233\nAnd then that's what happens, yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:56.241\nYou start losing that track.\n\n445\n00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.534\nAnd all of a sudden you realize,\nit was a cable, but\n\n446\n00:23:59.534 --> 00:24:02.770\nit doesn't even look like\nit's pinned in correctly.\n\n447\n00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.940\nAnd that's even harder, you go,\nno, the cable looks good.\n\n448\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, and in troubleshooting theory\nyou always start with the simple things\n\n449\n00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.330\nfirst, right?\n\n450\n00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.180\nDoes it have power?\n\n451\n00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.920\nIs it plugged in?\n\n452\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.830\nIs it plugged in correctly?\n\n453\n00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.110\nIs it making contact?\n\n454\n00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.566\nIf you get through that physical layer,\neverything's up and\n\n455\n00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:18.899\nrunning, then you know it's not there.\n\n456\n00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:20.430\nIf everything's on the up and up.\n\n457\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.832\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the easiest things, right,\nthat people can and it shouldn't be,\n\n458\n00:24:24.832 --> 00:24:26.277\nbut if people are hiring.\n\n459\n00:24:26.277 --> 00:24:28.570\nThey're like, all right, so here it is.\n\n460\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.560\nTake this cable, plug it in,\nmake this device work.\n\n461\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.200\nAnd if it doesn't work, do you know.\n\n462\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.930\nThey handed you what the answer is, okay.\n\n463\n00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.390\nBut they're expecting you\nto examine the cable and\n\n464\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.110\nverify it's the type of cable that you\nneed when you're plugging in that device.\n\n465\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.600\nBut Cisco says look,\nlet's not deal with that.\n\n466\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.540\nLet's build it into the interface,\nto the port itself, okay, so\n\n467\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.560\nthat we never have to deal with it.\n\n468\n00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.790\nSo regardless of whether you\npick up a crossover cable,\n\n469\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.470\nregardless of whether you pick up\na straight-through cable, it will work.\n\n470\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.260\nSo if you put two switches on top, and\n\n471\n00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.960\nyou go crud I have to make a crossover\ncable and you don't know how to do that.\n\n472\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.480\nWell Cisco says don't worry about it,\n\n473\n00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480\nI'll help you out\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n474\n00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.030\n&gt;&gt; It will do it, okay?\n\n475\n00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.910\nSo today, cabling should not be an issue.\n\n476\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.730\nThat doesn't mean Cisco doesn't\nexpect you to know whether or\n\n477\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.920\nnot it can do that, okay?\n\n478\n00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.350\nSo this is also gonna be\nage-dependant on the switch and\n\n479\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.790\nthe platform itself as well.\n\n480\n00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.790\nSome of the really older switches that\nare out there, Pry will not do this,\n\n481\n00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.870\nand that's a feature that is called MDIX,\nthat's out there.\n\n482\n00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.220\nWhere it automatically detects the cable\nand what it needs to do on the other end.\n\n483\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.080\nWhether it needs to send or\nreceive and it will switch it around.\n\n484\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.830\nSo whether you use a crossover cable,\nwhether you actually use a straight\n\n485\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:48.560\nthrough cable, it says I am\nsmart enough to figure this out.\n\n486\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.860\nOkay, that's what it will actually do for\nus.\n\n487\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.260\nSo that's one of those things that we want\nto make sure that we understand it, okay?\n\n488\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.180\nSo what do we need to determine that?\n\n489\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.620\nWell, the great thing is usually every\nport today or every switch today, right.\n\n490\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.920\nJust about every device today it has\nit set to auto to do the MDIX, right?\n\n491\n00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.890\nSo what if we wanted\nto manually configure?\n\n492\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.940\nSo on NYCORE1, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n493\n00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.660\nI'm gonna go into our global config.\n\n494\n00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.800\nNope, I have to spell terminal right,\nconfigure terminal.\n\n495\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.130\nAnd then let's get into that interface.\n\n496\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:31.197\nSo interface Fastethernet 1/0/2,\n\n497\n00:26:31.197 --> 00:26:34.520\nthis one says do it on port 22.\n\n498\n00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.104\nWe'll do this on port 22 here, and\nI have to spell interface right.\n\n499\n00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:53.345\nHere underlined in red, so\nI'm actually trying to be careful.\n\n500\n00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:54.137\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n501\n00:26:54.137 --> 00:26:57.496\nnow that's actually kind of pointing\nout something I wouldn't expect here.\n\n502\n00:26:57.496 --> 00:27:02.648\nSo now if I wanted to make sure auto MDIX\n\n503\n00:27:02.648 --> 00:27:08.127\nis actually off, I just do no MDIX auto.\n\n504\n00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:11.280\nAnd that will automatically\njust turn that off.\n\n505\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.700\nSo if this is turned off it\nmeans you will have to decide\n\n506\n00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.400\nwhat cable that you have\nto actually put in there.\n\n507\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.220\nSo I can see, Daniel, on this just\nin the last few minutes that we have\n\n508\n00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.610\ntogether here right,\nas far as exam this is a great one, right?\n\n509\n00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That the very fact that it's like look\n\n510\n00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:33.325\njey, you need to select the proper cable.\n\n511\n00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:36.377\nOr, you believe that MDIX is turned on,\nbut\n\n512\n00:27:36.377 --> 00:27:40.759\nwhen you plug in a straight through cable,\nit's not working.\n\n513\n00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:41.821\n&gt;&gt; One of those little gotcha questions.\n\n514\n00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:45.459\n&gt;&gt; Yes, one of those little gotcha\nquestions, which is simple,\n\n515\n00:27:45.459 --> 00:27:48.699\nthat means MDIX was turned\noff at some point or somehow.\n\n516\n00:27:48.699 --> 00:27:51.100\nAnd all you have to do is enable it again.\n\n517\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.930\nBut that's what you have\nto be able to determine.\n\n518\n00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.860\nSo it's not exactly\nthe hardest thing in the world,\n\n519\n00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.930\nbut it's one of those where it\njust kinda slipped in, right?\n\n520\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:04.690\nAnd this is an easy points for\nthe exam type of question where it's like,\n\n521\n00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.930\nthis is not something I should miss\njust because I chose not to know it.\n\n522\n00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n523\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.200\n&gt;&gt; There's so much stuff out there, but\n\n524\n00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.960\nthis is one just like man, that's\nan easy question marked off and do that.\n\n525\n00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.070\nAnd so you can get a lot of\njust stuff just by doing this.\n\n526\n00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.500\nSo that's it, because cabling today\nshould not be an issue, period.\n\n527\n00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It should not be, okay.\n\n528\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.320\nUnless you get like,\na Ronnie Wong special cable Which means,\n\n529\n00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.608\nhe didn't try to follow any\nparticular standard at all.\n\n530\n00:28:31.608 --> 00:28:36.090\nHe just kinda randomly made\nan RJ45 connector, and\n\n531\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:42.040\njust scrambled up all the wires and\nshoved them in there.\n\n532\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.632\nEven Cisco is gonna have\na hard time with that cable.\n\n533\n00:28:44.632 --> 00:28:47.310\n&gt;&gt; They're like whoa buddy,\nwhat are you doing?\n\n534\n00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.570\nWhat are you doing?\n\n535\n00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.320\n&gt;&gt; Can that happen?\n\n536\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.910\nYes, okay, it can happen.\n\n537\n00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.720\n&gt;&gt; I've seen stranger things, Daniel.\n\n538\n00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.080\n&gt;&gt; It's a great show.\n\n539\n00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.808\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n540\n00:28:57.808 --> 00:28:58.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a great show.\n\n541\n00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:00.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at some point,\n\n542\n00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:02.037\nI've seen where people are like,\n\n543\n00:29:02.037 --> 00:29:06.010\nwell it only needs two pairs of wire and\nthey literally just put four wires.\n\n544\n00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:11.110\nI’m like there's eight slots, just fill in\nthe rest of this thing, are you joking?\n\n545\n00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:16.300\n&gt;&gt; That sounds a lot like work and\nI'm not really into that.\n\n546\n00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.090\n&gt;&gt; Like I said,\nI've seen a lot of strange things,\n\n547\n00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.920\nI'm not pointing out\nanybody in particular.\n\n548\n00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.290\nBut when you start seeing stuff like that.\n\n549\n00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.670\nThis is in a production,\nit's not even a testing environment.\n\n550\n00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.141\nYou're using this to allow for\nyour data and your business to run.\n\n551\n00:29:30.141 --> 00:29:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Right you would think that\nyou'd want that work properly.\n\n552\n00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but so.\n\n553\n00:29:35.989 --> 00:29:37.412\n&gt;&gt; A little time and care.\n\n554\n00:29:37.412 --> 00:29:40.690\n&gt;&gt; But that's what they're told,\nthat's somehow some people learn that way.\n\n555\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.640\nYeah you only need four of the eight\nwires, so why deal with the other four?\n\n556\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.730\nBut those are some of the other things\nthat kind of scare you a little bit.\n\n557\n00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But like I said Cisco says look\n\n558\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:55.770\nas long as they are fairly standard\nstraight through or they are crossover.\n\n559\n00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.980\nYou shouldn't have to deal with that mess.\n\n560\n00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.540\nBut if you have to there is a reason\nwhy when you put in the right cable and\n\n561\n00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.470\nit's still not working.\n\n562\n00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.770\nThe wrong cable I should say.\n\n563\n00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.050\nAnd it's still not working for\nyou, I would check this on\n\n564\n00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:12.530\neach interface that they're tell you to\nconnect to, verify which side is off.\n\n565\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.570\nOr if both sides is off, then you\ncould either turn it on or actually\n\n566\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.070\nchoose the right cable, turn both sides\noff and you'll be off and ready to go.\n\n567\n00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.770\nSo, Daniel, that will pretty much cover\nthe idea of interfaces and cables for\n\n568\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.560\nus, and\nbeing able to troubleshoot them too.\n\n569\n00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.930\n&gt;&gt; It was great troubleshooting tips, and\n\n570\n00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.740\nit was good food for thought as we look\nto the future in our CCENT Series.\n\n571\n00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.800\nWell, Ronnie we are out of time for this\nepisode so we do thank you for joining us.\n\n572\n00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.000\nWe thank you good folks as always for\nwatching, but signing off,\n\n573\n00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.100\nfor ITPROTV I've been your host,\nDaniel

00:00:04.399\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.876\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:10.673\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.248\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:16.740\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.910\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.810\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.720\nwell, you guessed it,\nwe're back with more on our CCENT series.\n\n11\n00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.430\nJoining us in the studio yet again,\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.170\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n13\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.930\nHow's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.230\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.320\nThank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on, of course,\n\n16\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.450\nin our journey right here on CCENT.\n\n17\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.630\nWe are now at the episode inside\nof the switching topic here\n\n18\n00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.060\nwhere we begin to create VLANs.\n\n19\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.000\nNow if this is something that\nsounds brand new to you,\n\n20\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.770\nwell, you're going to learn\na little bit about it.\n\n21\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.840\nSo we have to talk a little\nbit of conceptual theory here.\n\n22\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.650\nAnd then, of course,\n\n23\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.280\nthat means we are also going to show you\nhow you actually create these things.\n\n24\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.080\nAnd also, of course, talk about why\nwe also need to create these as well.\n\n25\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.250\nOkay, so it's really important for us to\nunderstand, of course, the concept and\n\n26\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.300\nthe use of VLANs because\nthey are used everywhere\n\n27\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.940\ninside of networking switches today.\n\n28\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.340\nAnd it is one of the reasons why we\nactually do want to end up using\n\n29\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.370\nswitches a lot of times is because we\ncan now create VLANs, which stands for\n\n30\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.330\nvirtual local area networks.\n\n31\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.600\nSo let's get back to a basic idea before\nwe go into the idea of VLANs here.\n\n32\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.080\nLet's take a look at my diagram here for\na moment.\n\n33\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.140\nSo I've used this before in a previous\nepisode where we talked about the idea of\n\n34\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.220\ndomains and collision domains as well and\nbroadcast domains.\n\n35\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.530\nSo if we have a hub, remember that for\nus the end result of this,\n\n36\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.350\nright, is that we have a single broadcast\ndomain and a single collision domain.\n\n37\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.990\nAnd when something like this happens,\nwell,\n\n38\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.780\nthat means one device\neverybody hears which is fine.\n\n39\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.190\nTwo devices communicating simultaneously\nwill essentially cause a collision, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.927\nWell, then we introduced the concept of\nswitches which don't reduce broadcast.\n\n41\n00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:05.550\nI'm gonna say them backwards here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.610\nDon't reduce broadcast domain or\nlimit broadcast domains, but\n\n43\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.380\nactually do start to\nlimit collision domains.\n\n44\n00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.180\nBy creating more collision domains, we\nactually eliminate a lot more collisions.\n\n45\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.400\nSounds strange but\nit is the way that it ends up happening.\n\n46\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.630\nAnd that's because today's switches,\n\n47\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.100\nevery single port on a switch\nrepresents its own collision domain.\n\n48\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.710\nBut the only time you should\nend up getting collisions,\n\n49\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.110\nthe majority of times is when you actually\nhave two devices off of that single port.\n\n50\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.290\nAnd normally you're not gonna have that.\n\n51\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.578\nSo just about all collisions have,\nkind of been eliminated that way.\n\n52\n00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:46.418\nBut the problem that we have still,\nthough,\n\n53\n00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:49.960\nis that now we have this\none big broadcast domain.\n\n54\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.891\nSo in that sense, it works,\nit does exactly what we need to do.\n\n55\n00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:58.081\nBut this also then, of course,\nmeans that if you want to connect people\n\n56\n00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:03.361\ntogether in their proper, let's say,\nlogical management grouping,\n\n57\n00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:08.430\nit means you also have to assign\nindividual switches to them.\n\n58\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.330\nSo for example, okay,\nwe could take ITProTV studios and\n\n59\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.400\ndo this if we want to in this sense, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.350\nI could put a switch right here in\nthis studio for all the devices\n\n61\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.350\nthat we connect to it and that would also,\nof course, be as broadcast domain.\n\n62\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.910\nSo anything I send in that switch,\n\n63\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.980\nif I wanna broadcast it to every device\nthat's connected in here, I could do that.\n\n64\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.350\nBut I don't want that broadcast going\nout over to Studio 1, Studio 2,\n\n65\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.760\nStudio 3, Studio 4.\n\n66\n00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.350\nI don't want that.\n\n67\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.230\nSo what I would actually do here,\nright, is that one switch,\n\n68\n00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.120\nthough, would essentially represent\nthat broadcast domain for Studio 5.\n\n69\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.016\nThen of course, Studio 1 would have its\nown, Studio 2 would have its own, 3, 4,\n\n70\n00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:51.570\nyou get it.\n\n71\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.670\nThey would all have their\nown individual switches.\n\n72\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.050\nNow, at that point it would be ideal,\nthough, if you bought a switch and\n\n73\n00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.321\nyou only had the number of ports that you\nneeded to, okay, on that one switch and\n\n74\n00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:09.720\nthen you never needed to add any more and\nthat would be fine.\n\n75\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.780\nBut here's what normally happens in a\ncompany, though, especially when you start\n\n76\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.340\noff in a small company is that you go,\nall right, here it is.\n\n77\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.030\nWhat we're gonna do instead, Daniel, is we\nare gonna buy this one big switch instead.\n\n78\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.010\nLet's say it's a 3560, and\nit has 48 ports on it, okay, not uncommon.\n\n79\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.910\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But it has 48 ports.\n\n80\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.150\nWell, remember that even on a 40\nport switch, that means that what,\n\n81\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.600\nit's still one big broadcast domain.\n\n82\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.640\nSo and\nnow we're gonna use that to help us out,\n\n83\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.980\nto subdivide that up among five different\nstudios, well, that now becomes\n\n84\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.730\na head scratcher if they're supposed\nto be on their own broadcast domain.\n\n85\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.220\nOkay, so that's where we run into\nthe realm of what we call VLANs.\n\n86\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.180\nVLANs allow us to, well, subdivide,\nor I like to use the term,\n\n87\n00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.580\nchop up that 48 port switch\nlogically to where what I can do\n\n88\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.260\nis I can create smaller, logical switches\non that one big 48 port switch instead.\n\n89\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.902\nThat way I can assign\na single VLAN to Studio 5.\n\n90\n00:05:13.902 --> 00:05:18.751\nI can assign one to Studio 1,\nStudio 2, Studio 3, Studio 4, and\n\n91\n00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:21.950\nput a certain number of ports in them.\n\n92\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.590\nAnd that now allows me on a single switch\n\n93\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.980\nto do something that we couldn't\ndo before, which is to create\n\n94\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.790\nmultiple broadcast domains\ninstead on that single switch.\n\n95\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Now you're just talking crazy, Ronnie.\n\n96\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.160\nYou can't do this.\n\n97\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we would say that we can't do it.\n\n98\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.598\nNow, literally, right,\nif we were to try and\n\n99\n00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:44.102\ndo this with a 48 port switch\nin a physical manner, right,\n\n100\n00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:47.980\nwe'd take a bandsaw and\ncreate five different sections.\n\n101\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.490\nBut the nice thing about\nwhat VLAN does is, one,\n\n102\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.530\nit doesn't destroy\nthe actual device itself.\n\n103\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.855\n&gt;&gt; That's always a plus.\n\n104\n00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:55.179\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't destroy\n\n105\n00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:57.820\nthe device from functioning,\nand that's a good thing.\n\n106\n00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.390\nAnd then, two, though, okay,\nit really doesn't need for\n\n107\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.710\nus to group any one of\nthose ports together.\n\n108\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.870\nIn oversight, all right, first five\nports are all gonna be Studio 1,\n\n109\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.590\nand then the second ten\nports are gonna be Studio 2.\n\n110\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.640\nI don't actually have to have\nthem in contiguous blocks, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.640\nAnd what I can do now instead is as the\nnetwork developed in whatever natural way\n\n112\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.881\nthat it developed, right,\nI can now take that 48 port switch and\n\n113\n00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:30.730\ngo all right, we're gonna take these\nports over here and there's one other\n\n114\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.695\none over here on port 47, and I can put\nthem into one logical VLAN grouping.\n\n115\n00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.170\nSo I don't have to worry about\nwhere they're plugged into.\n\n116\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.190\nI just need to know what's\nplugged into them and\n\n117\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.870\nthen I can create that\nlogical grouping for us.\n\n118\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.710\nSo there's a couple of different\nconfigurations that we\n\n119\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.410\nhave to actually deal with when we do\nsomething like this as it happens, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.050\nSo how in the world is\nsomething like this done,\n\n121\n00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.680\nis what we want to begin to talk about,\nokay?\n\n122\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.300\nSo here it is, I just made an 8-port\nswitch to show you an example of what I've\n\n123\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.310\nbeen talking about here.\n\n124\n00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.850\nOkay, so right now currently, and the way\nthat the switch is configured, right,\n\n125\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.850\nis that there is a single broadcast\ndomain for these 16 ports, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.930\nNow in the default setting of this,\nthat means all 16 ports again.\n\n127\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.950\nOne gets in, a broadcast goes out to\nthe other 15, we're perfectly fine.\n\n128\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.210\nAnd it works for us.\n\n129\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.219\nAlso default in the background, of course,\nis that on the Cisco device and\n\n130\n00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:34.100\nin Cisco iOS has also created what we\ncall a default VLAN for every port.\n\n131\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.892\nSo when you hear somebody say,\nwe don't use VLANs at all,\n\n132\n00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:40.176\nyou're still technically using a VLAN and\nthat's actually [CROSSTALK]-\n\n133\n00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:42.043\n&gt;&gt; There's this one that's built in,\n\n134\n00:07:42.043 --> 00:07:44.520\nconfigured and\nactually working out of the box.\n\n135\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Out of the box.\n\n136\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.465\nAnd it's one that you can't get rid of,\nso.\n\n137\n00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:47.927\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I mean,\n\n138\n00:07:47.927 --> 00:07:52.302\nit's just working out of the box and every\nsingle port is in that VLAN by default.\n\n139\n00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:58.393\nAnd that is a logical representation\nof that gigantic grouping that we have.\n\n140\n00:07:58.393 --> 00:08:02.847\nAnd the reason why that's important is\nbecause if I can logically make that\n\n141\n00:08:02.847 --> 00:08:08.040\ngrouping that's that big, it means I\ncan also create logical subdivisions.\n\n142\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.110\nIn other words, additional VLANs and\nthen just logically move\n\n143\n00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.200\nthose ports into those VLANs, and\nhave them associated that way, as well.\n\n144\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.420\nNow here is the rub when you\ndo something like this, right?\n\n145\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.230\nIs that normally, and the reason I'm\nsaying normally is because where gonna\n\n146\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.870\nbreak this rule when we get\ninto our demonstration.\n\n147\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.200\nNormally, a single port or\n\n148\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.000\na single interface can only be in\na single VLAN at any one time.\n\n149\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.510\nSo that's what we also have too.\n\n150\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.584\nSo if you put this port\nnumber one here in VLAN10,\n\n151\n00:08:43.584 --> 00:08:49.680\nit cannot also be in VLAN20 or\nVLAN11 at the same time.\n\n152\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.130\nNow I said that,\nI said it normally can't be.\n\n153\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.180\nBut we're gonna kinda violate that.\n\n154\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.220\nBecause there is another type of\nVLAN that we need to talk about,\n\n155\n00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.290\nwhich is the voice VLAN, which we'll\nget to in a little bit of time here.\n\n156\n00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.190\nBut, that's essentially what\nends up happening when you start\n\n157\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.080\ndoing something like this, okay.\n\n158\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.990\nSo when we start the configuration and\nwe start doing this here, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.380\nLet's make sure we understand\nthe logic behind this So\n\n160\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.430\neven though there is VLAN ]1, and that\nencompasses all the ports on the switch,\n\n161\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.790\nwe can create VLANs in different,\nto help us out.\n\n162\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.450\nSo let's say we wanted to\nhave three of these ports\n\n163\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.960\nas being in another VLAN, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.210\nSo let's say that I want this port here.\n\n165\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.774\nAnd this port here.\n\n166\n00:09:40.926 --> 00:09:42.850\nAnd this port here, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.130\nJust marking it as different\ncolors if I want to.\n\n168\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.630\nAnd I wanted to put\nthem into another VLAN.\n\n169\n00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.140\nWell, I can create another VLAN here.\n\n170\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.240\nAnd we'll call this one\nVLAN5 just as an example.\n\n171\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.520\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, these VLANs,\n\n172\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.080\nyou can name them any number you want as\nlong as they're not already being used?\n\n173\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.477\n&gt;&gt; Right, so yes.\n\n174\n00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:06.990\nAnd we'll do this one as marketing\nhere for right now, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.770\nNow, once I do that, okay,\nthat means each one of\n\n176\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.637\nthose ports will now be associated\nin its own broadcast domain.\n\n177\n00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:25.224\nSo that now means, well, VLAN5, and\n\n178\n00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:29.209\nit is in its own broadcast domain as well.\n\n179\n00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:32.773\nAnd then, if you said look,\nwe need another VLAN for\n\n180\n00:10:32.773 --> 00:10:36.350\nanother concept here,\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n181\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.692\nWhat if I wanted these two ports\nto also be in another VLAN?\n\n182\n00:10:40.692 --> 00:10:44.292\nWell, I could do that as well,\nwhere those two ports are in their VLAN.\n\n183\n00:10:53.018 --> 00:10:55.950\nAnd we'll call this one VLAN6 here.\n\n184\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.784\nCall this one for, I don't know, content.\n\n185\n00:11:06.338 --> 00:11:08.930\nThis one will actually be for content.\n\n186\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.807\nMake sure that we understand\nthat that one's the red one.\n\n187\n00:11:19.007 --> 00:11:23.903\nSee if I can actually get that\nconfigured correctly there.\n\n188\n00:11:23.903 --> 00:11:27.770\nAnd now that also is its own\nbroadcast domain as well.\n\n189\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.810\nSo, it doesn't have to be contiguous\nports that are grouped together here.\n\n190\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:37.571\nIt allows me to actually take whatever\nI want here to be able to do that.\n\n191\n00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:39.590\nSo, we can do same thing here,\n\n192\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.580\nlet's say that these additional ones\nhere are also gonna be the same thing.\n\n193\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:51.867\nNow that I've messed it up,\nmy coloring scheme here.\n\n194\n00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:58.000\nI'm gonna do just one more that will kind\nof be enough for us to make our example.\n\n195\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:07.315\nDo VLAN7.\n\n196\n00:12:07.315 --> 00:12:13.340\nAnd we'll make this one,\nlet's say customer service.\n\n197\n00:12:15.538 --> 00:12:19.416\nAnd remember that each one of these now,\n\n198\n00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:24.447\nis essentially just a smaller\nsubset of the switch.\n\n199\n00:12:24.447 --> 00:12:29.070\nSo within each of these VLANs, they\nmay be a smaller number of ports here,\n\n200\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.531\nright, that we have all together, but\n\n201\n00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:35.803\nyet we can treat them as if they're\non their own individual switch.\n\n202\n00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:40.466\nAnd that means that they're actually in\ntheir own little broadcast domain when you\n\n203\n00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:42.930\nstart to actually work with them.\n\n204\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.930\nSo this is one big physical switch but\nin reality,\n\n205\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.670\nin terms of the way that\nI interact with them.\n\n206\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:54.619\nActually can treat as if it's four or\nfive different smaller switches instead.\n\n207\n00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:55.900\nAnd what about the rest of these ports?\n\n208\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.500\nThe rest of these ports will\nstill be in VLAN1 at this point.\n\n209\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.410\nSo you can count that and\n\n210\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.760\nthat will be actually four different VLANs\nall together that we're currently using.\n\n211\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.150\nSo it gives us that ability to\ninsure that when we do that,\n\n212\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.210\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n213\n00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.620\nNow, when you start seeing\nsomething like this, right?\n\n214\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.480\nIt's like, okay, so that's great.\n\n215\n00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.932\nAllows me to take like a 48 port switch\nand I can subdivide it however I want to.\n\n216\n00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:21.124\nIt allows me to highly optimize,\nin other words,\n\n217\n00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:24.160\nuse that port that's on that switch.\n\n218\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.701\nAnd I don't have to worry\nabout five 48 port switches.\n\n219\n00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:29.740\nI can actually just do that.\n\n220\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.010\nBut, this of course is also\nwhat happens in networks,\n\n221\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.860\nwhich is something that we don't\naccount for very often as well.\n\n222\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.535\nDaniel, sometimes though,\nthe network grows bigger and\n\n223\n00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:42.012\ngrows faster than what we expect it to.\n\n224\n00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:42.705\n&gt;&gt; It does do that.\n\n225\n00:13:42.705 --> 00:13:46.676\nAnd even going back to when we were\ntalking about subdividing these things,\n\n226\n00:13:46.676 --> 00:13:50.850\nthink about let's say you bought a bunch\nof 8 port switches to make 48 ports.\n\n227\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.950\nYou could do that.\n\n228\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.505\nBut then you gotta stack\nthem all together.\n\n229\n00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:54.812\nAnd it's gonna be power.\n\n230\n00:13:54.812 --> 00:13:56.160\nIt's gonna be a whole lot more.\n\n231\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.091\nAnd you got the one device logically\nbreaking them up using VLANs is a much\n\n232\n00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:00.873\nbetter idea.\n\n233\n00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:04.323\nBut if you're right Ronnie, sometimes\neven that is not quite enough, and\n\n234\n00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:07.224\nwe do what we have to,\nwell either purchase a bigger switch with\n\n235\n00:14:07.224 --> 00:14:10.598\nmore ports or buy another switch and\nyou can link them together, right.\n\n236\n00:14:10.598 --> 00:14:12.771\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nwhen it comes down to that, right so\n\n237\n00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:14.620\nthose are the two options, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.142\nOne, switch this small, tiny,\nlittle thing out and then go,\n\n239\n00:14:18.142 --> 00:14:20.408\nwe're gonna buy this one beefy switch.\n\n240\n00:14:20.408 --> 00:14:23.996\nWhich Cisco would love it,\nbecause they aren't cheap.\n\n241\n00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:26.485\n&gt;&gt; No, they're not giving them away,\nare they, Ronnie?\n\n242\n00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:28.114\n[LAUGH] You don't get a BOGO.\n\n243\n00:14:28.114 --> 00:14:28.848\n&gt;&gt; Not on this one.\n\n244\n00:14:28.848 --> 00:14:29.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n245\n00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:31.460\nthere is no BOGO deal on this one.\n\n246\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.966\nBuy one get one,\nyou're not gonna get that.\n\n247\n00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.562\n&gt;&gt; If you see that, you snatch it up fast.\n\n248\n00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:37.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you snatch it up fast especially\non a new one, you're not gonna get that.\n\n249\n00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:38.569\n&gt;&gt; Buy two.\n\n250\n00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:41.290\n[LAUGH] Yeah but at this point right,\nthat's what happens.\n\n251\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.030\nMore than likely what\nyou would end up doing\n\n252\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.620\nis actually just purchasing\nanother switch to do so.\n\n253\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.730\nNow when we add that in there, and\nI've already created these VLANs,\n\n254\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.050\nwell that means what do I\nhave to do though, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.065\nWhat did that one VLAN continue to go?\n\n256\n00:14:57.065 --> 00:15:00.951\nSo let's say for example here, customer\nservice team continues to grow beyond what\n\n257\n00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:02.659\nthe capabilities of that switch is.\n\n258\n00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:08.870\nWell now we want to actually\ngo to multiple switches, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.680\nWell, when you start actually now saying,\nhey, multiple switches.\n\n260\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.432\nNow what color did I make that one here?\n\n261\n00:15:15.432 --> 00:15:18.680\nYellow, okay, I just wanted to make\nsure that I did the same thing.\n\n262\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.566\nWhat a VLAN can also do for us, is that\nonce we connect these devices together,\n\n263\n00:15:24.566 --> 00:15:30.916\nand we'll show you how to do that, is that\na single VLAN, oops, I did the wrong one.\n\n264\n00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:35.220\nWho would have guessed that I would\npick the wrong tool right there?\n\n265\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.666\nOkay, is that I can actually get\nit to go well, this way too.\n\n266\n00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:49.310\nSo in other words, a single VLAN can\nalso span multiple switches, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.473\nSo I just did two in this instance here.\n\n268\n00:15:51.473 --> 00:15:55.209\nBut that means that even if I\ncreate that one VLAN over here,\n\n269\n00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:58.421\nI can also add ports in that\nsame VLAN over here, and\n\n270\n00:15:58.421 --> 00:16:03.145\nthey will work together as if\nthey're actually on a single switch.\n\n271\n00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:04.980\nNow you may be wondering,\nwhy the heck would I do that?\n\n272\n00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.700\nWell, let's just imagine usually the\ntypical diagram that you see right here\n\n273\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.980\nis that you'll see, let's say for\nexample, marketing is on one floor, okay.\n\n274\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.120\nAnd hen you have, of course,\nadministration on another floor and\n\n275\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:23.250\nthen you have your customer\nservice team on the third floor.\n\n276\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.297\nBut you have some managers that are on\nthe first, second and third floor,\n\n277\n00:16:26.297 --> 00:16:27.190\ndo you wanna do that?\n\n278\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.867\nIf you wanna connect all of them together\nwithout moving them to each floor to\n\n279\n00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:32.040\naccommodate.\n\n280\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.040\nWell now, that means that I can put\neverybody that I want to on each floor\n\n281\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.520\ninto any switch that I want to and\nassign them to the same Vlan.\n\n282\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.054\nAnd that puts them in the same broadcast\ndomain regardless of what switch that\n\n283\n00:16:44.054 --> 00:16:45.830\nthey're in, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.230\nNow once we start getting\nbeyond that single one, right?\n\n285\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:54.000\nSo remember that on a single switch\nWe're essentially subdividing\n\n286\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.910\nout what we're seeing here.\n\n287\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:05.120\nWhere it really does become,\nWhere it's really like this is a grouping.\n\n288\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.900\nAll right, and even a few more there.\n\n289\n00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.880\nAnd another one, and\nhere's another broadcast domain.\n\n290\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.700\nThat may also be happening.\n\n291\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.050\nAnd here's another one that\ncan also be happening as well.\n\n292\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.500\nSo this is us chopping\nthat single switch up.\n\n293\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.360\nWhen we start going to multiple switches,\nnow we can\n\n294\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.130\nspan multiple switches with\na single VLAN if we choose to.\n\n295\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.610\nAnd it still does not have to\nbe where it is all contiguous.\n\n296\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.110\nSo let's say that I take this and\nI change it to the red one here.\n\n297\n00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.270\nSo it may be where, of course,\nwhy would it actually work the same way?\n\n298\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.870\nWhy would it choose to do the exact same\nthing here, yeah, why would it, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.420\nSo we could do that and\nalso this one here.\n\n300\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.410\nGo across this way.\n\n301\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.560\nI'll change all that to red.\n\n302\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.857\nMy tool is not exactly the most intuitive\ntool to be able to use to do this, but\n\n303\n00:18:06.857 --> 00:18:08.412\nit is nice, I do like it.\n\n304\n00:18:08.412 --> 00:18:09.347\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:18:09.347 --> 00:18:10.454\n&gt;&gt; So it will actually allow\n\n306\n00:18:10.454 --> 00:18:11.090\nus to do this.\n\n307\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.690\nSo remember,\nit doesn't have to be that but\n\n308\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.600\nnow that's kinda the weird thing, right?\n\n309\n00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.920\nIt's the opposite, right?\n\n310\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.520\nIf you only have a single switch,\nVLAN's allowed us to subdivide that and\n\n311\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.380\ncreate multiple smaller\nbroadcast domain-on switches.\n\n312\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.547\nAnd even though that's normally\nthe venue of what routers do,\n\n313\n00:18:28.547 --> 00:18:33.041\nVLANs allow us to do same\nthing on switches too, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:36.485\nThen, when you start tying\nmultiple switches together,\n\n315\n00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:40.730\nthey allow us to expand a single\nvlan across multiple devices.\n\n316\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.180\nNow when we do something like this,\n\n317\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.380\nyou do have to take in\nspecial consideration here.\n\n318\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.050\nThere's also gonna be ports\nthat you have to leave alone so\n\n319\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.420\nthat those vlans can\ncommunicate with each other or\n\n320\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.340\nthe same vlan can communicate\nwith each other across a switch.\n\n321\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.070\nAnd this is where instead,\nyou end up creating what you call trunks.\n\n322\n00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.360\nAt least I think you're\ngonna create a trunk here.\n\n323\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.090\nAt least that's the hope.\n\n324\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.380\nLet's see.\n\n325\n00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.950\nLet's make that bigger and thicker.\n\n326\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.841\nThere we go.\n\n327\n00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:16.705\nAnd then we'll do that, and\nmake it orange at this point.\n\n328\n00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:18.650\nSo you'll link a cable here.\n\n329\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.210\nAnd let me duplicate that table if I can.\n\n330\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.610\nAnd we'll do that as well, okay?\n\n331\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.755\nSo we'll actually take\ntwo ports like this,\n\n332\n00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:37.742\nand we'll reconfigure them to become\nwhat we call trunk ports, okay?\n\n333\n00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:41.210\nSo over here on the top,this\nidea of trunk ports.\n\n334\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:47.940\nTrunk ports will allow for the idea of\nmultiple VLANs to be able to use a single\n\n335\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.710\nlink to go across these switches so\nthat they can communicate with each other.\n\n336\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.690\nIn other words,\nred ports on this particular switch,\n\n337\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.670\ncan also communicate well with\nthe red ports on this switch.\n\n338\n00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.000\nWhat if I don't use trunks?\n\n339\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.640\nWhat do I have to do?\n\n340\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.335\nIf I do not use a trunk,\nwhat ends up happening instead is that for\n\n341\n00:20:08.335 --> 00:20:14.360\nevery vlan that is created here,\nlet me see if I can get back to this.\n\n342\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.206\nFor every VLAN that's created,\n\n343\n00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:22.284\ninside of that particular VLAN I\nwould have to make sure that\n\n344\n00:20:22.284 --> 00:20:27.930\nI run a single connection in\nto every single one of those.\n\n345\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.680\nSo I'd have to run my own link\ninside of that particular VLAN,\n\n346\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.240\nand then the same thing with\nthe yellow one over here,\n\n347\n00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.420\nis that I would also have\nto do that over here too.\n\n348\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.410\nSo if I do not configure\na trunk that allows for\n\n349\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.730\nmultiple VLANs to pass\nover a single connection.\n\n350\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.840\nThen I would also have to add these in.\n\n351\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.520\nAnd now all of a sudden I'm losing ports\n\n352\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.610\njust to make connections\nbetween those two VLANs.\n\n353\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:21:00.530\nSo instead,\nthe way to reduce the number of ports that\n\n354\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.680\nare just being used to communicate\nis to configure these particular\n\n355\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.730\nports over here to allow for\ntraffic, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.190\nFrom every VLAN to be able to cross over\nto this switch and then to this port.\n\n357\n00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.810\nAnd then get distributed out to\nthe proper VLAN the way that needs to be.\n\n358\n00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.840\nNow, this brings up to another point\nthat we also have to realize as well.\n\n359\n00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.860\nBecause we are creating\nseparate broadcast domains, and\n\n360\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.690\neven across multiple switches here,\nit also means that\n\n361\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:37.280\nthere will not be a direct\ninteraction between VLANs.\n\n362\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.790\nOkay, so if you have traffic that\nis destined for the red VLAN, even\n\n363\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:49.480\nif they're on the same switch they will\nnot directly talk to each other, okay?\n\n364\n00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.060\nIt just won't happen.\n\n365\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.600\nAnd that's because this is\none broadcast domain and\n\n366\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.530\nthis is now another broadcast domain.\n\n367\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.500\nSo Daniel, this brings us all the way back\nto that concept of IP addressing again.\n\n368\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.460\nIf you remember that when we broke up and\nwe started doing subnetting,\n\n369\n00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.590\neach particular subnet has\na broadcast address in it.\n\n370\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.580\nSo in theory that means that\nthis is one network over here,\n\n371\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.150\none of the logical IP networks.\n\n372\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.770\nAnd this actually can represent\nanother logical IP network as well.\n\n373\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.870\nSo that way they will not communicate\ndirectly with each other.\n\n374\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.620\nCan it be done though?\n\n375\n00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.140\nYes, you'll normally need a layer\n3 device that provides routing.\n\n376\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.820\nSo even between two ports that\nare directly the same here.\n\n377\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.520\nLet me move this one over here\njust as an example, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.130\nEven if this yellow VLAN port over\nhere was right net to this red port,\n\n379\n00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.210\nthey would not directly communicate or\n\n380\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:54.240\nsend data to each other, they would have\nto go out, get connected to a router.\n\n381\n00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.400\nThe router would route them\nto the proper VLAN and\n\n382\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.540\nthen it would come back in instead.\n\n383\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I tell you,\nthis concept used to just baffle me.\n\n384\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.110\nI would think,\nif I'm creating these VLANs, and\n\n385\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.810\nnow I want them to talk to each other.\n\n386\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.200\nWhy did I create the VLANs\nin the first place?\n\n387\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.960\nWhat's the whole purpose?\n\n388\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.530\nIt seemed convoluted to have a VLAN.\n\n389\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.965\nAnd then you have to have that go through\na router just to talk to a switchboard\n\n390\n00:23:17.965 --> 00:23:20.446\nthat without the VLANs,\nit could normally talked to.\n\n391\n00:23:20.446 --> 00:23:20.984\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n392\n00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:22.728\n&gt;&gt; But then,\nI started to understand network design and\n\n393\n00:23:22.728 --> 00:23:23.745\nthat made a little more sense.\n\n394\n00:23:23.745 --> 00:23:24.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n395\n00:23:24.506 --> 00:23:25.705\nthat's the whole goal, right?\n\n396\n00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:27.385\nIs because you normally need to,\n\n397\n00:23:27.385 --> 00:23:30.830\nbecause of the very fact that\nat the beginning, right?\n\n398\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.900\nWe needed to subdivide that 48\nport switching that 48 port\n\n399\n00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.630\nswitch instead of buying five of them.\n\n400\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.220\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But now that we have this capability\n\n401\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.800\nwith these VLAN's, we can logically\nconfigure essentially a switch, and using\n\n402\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.900\na layer three device to help us to route\nthe traffic in between them very easily.\n\n403\n00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.111\nSo it actually allows us to do that.\n\n404\n00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:54.474\nNow, can we do this also without a router?\n\n405\n00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:58.704\nYes, if you have what we\ncall a multilayer switch, or\n\n406\n00:23:58.704 --> 00:24:02.270\nalso you hear the term layer 3 switch.\n\n407\n00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.550\nThat means that the switch itself also has\nthe ability to do the routing inside it.\n\n408\n00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.333\nIt's not a full router, per se, that has\nevery single feature of routing built into\n\n409\n00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:15.600\nit, but\nit is enough to run a routing protocol.\n\n410\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.460\nIt's enough to also sit right there so\n\n411\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.010\nthat it can actually do what we need it\nto do, which is the inter-VLAN routing.\n\n412\n00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.520\nAnd that's probably\nthe preferred method today.\n\n413\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.758\nAnd the reason why is, that most of\nthe time, I don't wanna say most of it,\n\n414\n00:24:29.758 --> 00:24:34.580\njust about every place that you look,\nrouters, they're really edge\n\n415\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.540\ndevices between you, of course, and your\ninternet service provider a lot of times.\n\n416\n00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.140\nBut because internet service providers\nare also now on metro Ethernet,\n\n417\n00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.670\neven routers are kind of taking a back\nseat to the very fact that it's like,\n\n418\n00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.790\nwhy don't we just connect\nyou to a layer 3 switch?\n\n419\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.490\nAnd it's just another layer\n3 network that's out there.\n\n420\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.880\nSo even routers are having\nto take a back seat.\n\n421\n00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.010\nNow just when I say that, right?\n\n422\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.090\nIf you need security, putting a router and\n\n423\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:04.600\na firewall in place is absolutely\n100% the best way to go, okay?\n\n424\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.414\nBut you will see some networks that just\ngo, no, if it's just an Ethernet cable,\n\n425\n00:25:08.414 --> 00:25:08.952\nplug it in.\n\n426\n00:25:08.952 --> 00:25:12.851\nAs long as it's on VLAN, you are off and\nready to go, route in between them, and\n\n427\n00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:14.110\nyou can do that.\n\n428\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:18.833\nSo if you hear the term layer 3 switch,\nokay, or hear the term multilayer switch,\n\n429\n00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:22.154\nthat's probably the most\npopular configuration today.\n\n430\n00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:26.714\nBut the other one where you actually do\nattach a router, because of the way that\n\n431\n00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:31.430\nthe diagram ends up looking, the topology\nis normally called router on a stick.\n\n432\n00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.870\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say, isn't this the\nwhole router on a stick that we used to\n\n433\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.960\nsee back in the day all the time?\n\n434\n00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.173\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah, and\nthat's because it actually did look like,\n\n435\n00:25:37.173 --> 00:25:39.685\nbecause people would draw a straight\nline from the link to the router,\n\n436\n00:25:39.685 --> 00:25:41.534\nit looked like a lollipop\nsticking out of a switch.\n\n437\n00:25:41.534 --> 00:25:42.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n438\n00:25:42.056 --> 00:25:43.194\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is what it would look like.\n\n439\n00:25:43.194 --> 00:25:44.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n440\n00:25:44.062 --> 00:25:46.402\nit's kind of funny cuz I was all like,\nif I had called it router on a stick, and\n\n441\n00:25:46.402 --> 00:25:47.484\nthen somebody drew me the picture.\n\n442\n00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:49.295\nI was like, that makes more sense.\n\n443\n00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:50.061\n&gt;&gt; Router on a stick.\n\n444\n00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:52.348\n&gt;&gt; It looks like a router,\nand then it's on a stick.\n\n445\n00:25:52.348 --> 00:25:54.786\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty much it, so\n\n446\n00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:55.576\nthat's what we had.\n\n447\n00:25:55.576 --> 00:25:57.612\nNow over on the left-hand side,\n\n448\n00:25:57.612 --> 00:26:03.180\nyou will have trunk ports when you are\ncreating VLANs between multiple switches.\n\n449\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.910\nThe other thing that you'll also need\nto do is you'll need to configure\n\n450\n00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.230\nwhat is called either VLAN tagging or\nencapsulation, okay?\n\n451\n00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.921\nSo today the most popular blend of this,\nright,\n\n452\n00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:19.888\nis what we call,\nof course the 802.1q VLAN tagging, okay?\n\n453\n00:26:19.888 --> 00:26:24.256\nSo inside of the configuration though,\nyou'll call it encapsulation, but\n\n454\n00:26:24.256 --> 00:26:26.830\ntechnically, there's no encapsulation.\n\n455\n00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.430\nThen there's Cisco proprietary ISL,\n\n456\n00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:33.550\nthe Inter-Switch Linking type\nof encapsulation, as well.\n\n457\n00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.180\nAnd we'll get into more of this when\nwe get into the configuration itself.\n\n458\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:42.187\nBut these are just two different\nways to accomplish the ability\n\n459\n00:26:42.187 --> 00:26:48.300\nto differentiate VLANS as they go\nacross trunk leaks, trunk links.\n\n460\n00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.250\nI don't know where I missed the n,\nbut I did.\n\n461\n00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.410\nTrunk leaks, so that's what happens, okay?\n\n462\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.630\nSo we'll actually see\nwhere that's configured.\n\n463\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:01.300\nThe other thing that works as a benefit\nfor you and me are two layer 2 discovery\n\n464\n00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:07.120\nprotocols called cdp and lldp, which\nwe'll also need to get into, as well.\n\n465\n00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.870\nCisco Discovery Protocol and\nLink Local Discovery Protocol.\n\n466\n00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.532\nThese are two very neat protocols\nthat allow us to find out\n\n467\n00:27:15.532 --> 00:27:18.210\na ton of information about our devices.\n\n468\n00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.402\nAnd it also helps us when\nwe start to configure and\n\n469\n00:27:20.402 --> 00:27:23.408\nwe start having to troubleshoot,\nit's gonna help out, as well.\n\n470\n00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:26.652\nThe last concept that we're\nbriefly gonna mention, and\n\n471\n00:27:26.652 --> 00:27:31.044\nthen when we get into the lab, we'll\nkinda discuss it a little bit more here,\n\n472\n00:27:31.044 --> 00:27:33.766\nis this term,\nwhat we call native VLAN, okay?\n\n473\n00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:40.850\nIf you're using 802.1q, okay, you will\nhave something called a native vlan.\n\n474\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.907\nOnce you establish trunks and\nyou establish VLANS, every single thing\n\n475\n00:27:45.907 --> 00:27:50.551\nthat passes between these two switches,\nit will have a VLAN tag.\n\n476\n00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:54.581\nLike VLAN10, VLAN20, or VLAN5, 6, and 7.\n\n477\n00:27:54.581 --> 00:27:57.970\nWhatever it has,\nit will have that tag on it,\n\n478\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.175\nexcept that if you're sending\ndata to the native VLAN.\n\n479\n00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:06.296\nThe native VLAN is essentially\ntraffic that is untagged.\n\n480\n00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:09.830\nYou might wonder like, why the heck\nwould I ever send data that's untagged?\n\n481\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.380\nWell, that's a good question.\n\n482\n00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:16.150\nNormally, you don't, but by default,\nthat's normally our management\n\n483\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:21.200\ntraffic is where we send data that's\nactually untagged, is in that native VLAN.\n\n484\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.840\nWe normally do not want to put anything\nin the native VLAN in terms of\n\n485\n00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.740\nphysical ports to be\nassign to those VLANs.\n\n486\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.940\nThat means that nobody can access anything\nelse that's actually going through here.\n\n487\n00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.000\nSo we normally use this for\n\n488\n00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.900\nmanagement of the switches themselves\nif we're doing remote management.\n\n489\n00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.230\nBut we'll get into that concept, too.\n\n490\n00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.570\nSo at the very beginning,\n\n491\n00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:46.250\nthough, when we start, this is another\nthing that kind of gets confusing.\n\n492\n00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.530\nBy default, right,\non a single switch, okay?\n\n493\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:54.630\nWithout any configuration at all, your\ndefault VLAN1, which is something that\n\n494\n00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:00.640\nyou can't get rid of,\nis also by default your native VLAN.\n\n495\n00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.010\nAnd it should make sense.\n\n496\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.170\nAnd that's because, well,\nat the beginning, there's only one VLAN.\n\n497\n00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.090\nWell, which VLAN does it have to be in,\nthen?\n\n498\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.820\nHas to be in the native one that\ndoesn't have anything tagged.\n\n499\n00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.940\nSo most people will never,\nwell, I say most people.\n\n500\n00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.068\nA lot of companies, if they're small,\n\n501\n00:29:18.068 --> 00:29:21.022\nthey may never even deal with\nthe idea of needing VLANs.\n\n502\n00:29:21.022 --> 00:29:25.082\nBut as your network continues to grow,\nand you do need more broadcast\n\n503\n00:29:25.082 --> 00:29:28.582\ndomains to segment traffic out\nthe way that you want to, but\n\n504\n00:29:28.582 --> 00:29:33.750\nyou only have a single switch, well,\nVLANs will help you to be able to do that.\n\n505\n00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:38.570\nIf you continue to grow, and\nnow you need for multiple people or\n\n506\n00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:44.060\nmultiple devices to be on that same VLAN\neven if they're on multiple switches,\n\n507\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.390\nwell, then we can also encompass that,\nas well, by doing something like this.\n\n508\n00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.630\nAnd trunking to allow for\nthis all to happen.\n\n509\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.720\nSo now that we have some basic\nconceptual knowledge down, Daniel, okay?\n\n510\n00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.505\nIt means that we are going to be ready to\ntake a look at how we begin to configure\n\n511\n00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:00.284\nthese things.\n\n512\n00:30:00.284 --> 00:30:04.294\nAnd we'll show you how the operate and\nhow they break in between when we don't\n\n513\n00:30:04.294 --> 00:30:08.400\nhave a layer 3 device setup to handle\nthe routing in between, as well.\n\n514\n00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.920\nBut Daniel, that is for another episode.\n\n515\n00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.960\nSo now that we've got\nthe conceptual knowledge down,\n\n516\n00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.800\nit means we're ready to start configuring.\n\n517\n00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, great introduction\nto VLANS and our switching environments.\n\n518\n00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.064\nGood stuff, definitely join us for\nthe next episode so\n\n519\n00:30:21.064 --> 00:30:22.896\nwe can see Ronnie put that into practice.\n\n520\n00:30:22.896 --> 00:30:26.580\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun and\na good learning experience for you.\n\n521\n00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.589\nSo Ronnie, thanks for joining us today.\n\n522\n00:30:27.589 --> 00:30:30.956\nAnd we do thank you for watching, but\nlooks like we're at that time yet\n\n523\n00:30:30.956 --> 00:30:31.880\nagain to sign off.\n\n524\n00:30:31.880

00:00:08.044\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.013\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:13.806\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:16.384\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.469\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:21.840\nin today's episode we're back\nwith more of CCENT series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.437\nAnd joining us in the studio, you him and\nyou love him, is the one Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.270\nRonnie, welcome back man, how is it going?\n\n11\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.960\n&gt;&gt; it is going well, Daniel, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.890\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\nnow, of course, into our CCENT journey and\n\n13\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.020\nwe are of course talking about\nconfiguring and verifying VLANs now.\n\n14\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.220\nNow we already talked a little bit\nabout the idea of VLANs in terms of\n\n15\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.830\nconcepts and theories.\n\n16\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.960\nUnderstanding that what it allows us to\ndo with a single switch is to break that\n\n17\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.600\nswitch up or, as I like to call it,\nchop that switch up logically, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.500\nI essentially create smaller switches\nout of that particular VLAN.\n\n19\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.423\nAnd then of course, if we actually go\nacross multiple switches we can make those\n\n20\n00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:06.685\nVLANs span multiple switches,\nthereby actually creating multiple\n\n21\n00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:10.750\nbroadcast domains across\nmultiple switches themselves.\n\n22\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.801\nSo, it allows us to do a lot\nwhen we actually think about it,\n\n23\n00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:17.707\ncuz if not then the single physical\ndevice, especially a switch, is pretty\n\n24\n00:01:17.707 --> 00:01:22.510\nmuch the limits of its broadcast domain is\nthe number of ports that it has available.\n\n25\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.810\nSo this allows us to be able\nto use a switch more wisely or\n\n26\n00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.720\nmore conservatively if we need to.\n\n27\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.707\nOr it allows us to be able to also\ndeal with scalability, right?\n\n28\n00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:35.701\nContinue the add in switches and\nthen continue to add those same VLANs and\n\n29\n00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:40.025\nas long as we link them together with\ntrunk links they'll also of course be able\n\n30\n00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:43.384\nto function as those VLANs\nacross those multiple switches.\n\n31\n00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:48.380\nThereby having multiple broadcast\ndomains regardless of what particular\n\n32\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.680\nswitch that that VLAN is on.\n\n33\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.550\nIf we actually do have them across all\nthem, they'll extend that way as well.\n\n34\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.970\nSo that is where we are picking up.\n\n35\n00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.430\nSo all we have to do now, Dan,\nof course is, we wanna create some VLANs,\n\n36\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.410\nwe also of course want to\nassign ports into the VLAN.\n\n37\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.260\nSo in this IDM conceptually, even though\nwe haven't talk in the configuration side,\n\n38\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.205\nwhen we use VLANs, two steps\nessentially have to be done here, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:17.760\nOne is of course creating\nthe VLAN itself and\n\n40\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.550\nthen secondly we have to\nassign ports into that VLAN.\n\n41\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.200\nBecause if we only do one or the other,\nit's not really going to work.\n\n42\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.168\nSo we actually have to do both of them.\n\n43\n00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:30.590\nNow, we're gonna show you a couple\nof different methods to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.501\nOne actually is gonna be\nthat two-step method,\n\n45\n00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.560\nbecause they definitely\nare gonna test you on that.\n\n46\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.830\nAnd then the second one rolls everything\nup into one big step as well.\n\n47\n00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.382\nAnd both of them are valid\nconfigurations but\n\n48\n00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:46.680\nyou should feel fairly comfortable with\nthe way to actually do both of them,\n\n49\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.382\nis what you want to be able to know and\ndo, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:52.429\nSo, Daniel, we're gonna open\nup our practice labs here, and\n\n51\n00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.107\nI've already got the lab set up for us and\nI've turned it on, got it ready and\n\n52\n00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:58.197\npowered up the way that\nit needs to be here.\n\n53\n00:02:58.197 --> 00:03:03.428\nSo once I'm here I'm gonna select this\nnycore1 switch that will actually\n\n54\n00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:09.090\nallow me to connect to multiple devices\nthat are also around this is well.\n\n55\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.668\nNow, when I start off, okay, and\nI start to take a look at the switch here,\n\n56\n00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:18.031\none the first things that i want to do\nis I want to identify where the VLANs\n\n57\n00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:22.667\nactually are and if there's actually\nany already pre-configured here.\n\n58\n00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:25.579\nSo let me go ahead and\ntype in show, before I do that,\n\n59\n00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.650\nlet me press Enter a couple of times here.\n\n60\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.730\nAt least I think I'm going to.\n\n61\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.770\nThere we go.\n\n62\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.350\nAnd then get into of course\nthe privileged exec mode.\n\n63\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.990\nThen show VLAN.\n\n64\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.877\nAnd when I do that, it will start\nbringing up the VLAN database here.\n\n65\n00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:47.103\nOkay, now the VLAN database is\nactually going to be a file,\n\n66\n00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:49.700\nit's actually called vlan.dat.\n\n67\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.230\nAnd that file,\nwhen you shut down the actual switch, or\n\n68\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.415\nif you reboot the switch, anything that\nyou configure in this gets written to that\n\n69\n00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:03.650\nvlan.dat file, and\nthat vlan.dat file is on the flash, okay?\n\n70\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.790\nSo I'm emphasizing that again,\nvlan.dat is not stored in VRAM,\n\n71\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.190\nlike where the startup-config is stored,\nbut is normally stored in flash.\n\n72\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.160\nThe reason why this is gonna become\nimportant, even now for the exam,\n\n73\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.090\nis cuz of course you have\nto know where it's stored.\n\n74\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.893\nBut when you ever have to retask\nthat particular switch, or\n\n75\n00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:28.180\nyou're selling that switch.\n\n76\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.380\nOr you're re-purposing, not re-task,\nthat's the term I was looking for.\n\n77\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.210\nYou're re-purposing that switch.\n\n78\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.820\nEven if you get it back\nto a factory default.\n\n79\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.210\nLike you go okay, I'm just gonna\nput it back to a factory default.\n\n80\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.850\nOne of the files that you have\nto erase automatically, or\n\n81\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.570\nsecondarily I should say,\nis the vlan.dat file.\n\n82\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.440\nIf you don't erase it, that means\nthat they have your VLAN information.\n\n83\n00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.260\nWhoever you sell it to is gonna\nalso have your VLAN information.\n\n84\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.080\nAnd even though that doesn't sound like\na lot, it's still actually not what is\n\n85\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.990\nconsidered a factory default refresh\nwithout deleting out that vlan.dat.\n\n86\n00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.760\nSo initially when you first boot\nthe switch up, it doesn't start off with\n\n87\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.790\nthe vlan.dat except for something like\nthis, which it really only has one VLAN\n\n88\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.770\nconfigured with ports in it,\nwhich is the default VLAN here.\n\n89\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.630\nAnd notice that if you take a look at\nthe information that we're seeing, right?\n\n90\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.490\nVLAN, and it gives us the name,\nand this is the default one,\n\n91\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.460\nthe status right now is active as well.\n\n92\n00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.558\nAnd then notice that there's also all of\nthese ports that are listed in here too.\n\n93\n00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:37.121\nAnd that's every single port\non this particular switch, and\n\n94\n00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:39.485\nit's all in that one VLAN at this point.\n\n95\n00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:44.162\nNow, Daniel, I also end up seeing just\na little bit more information that I\n\n96\n00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:49.020\nmay have actually expected to see,\nbut I'm not exactly sure here.\n\n97\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.866\nIs, notice there's actually these\nother additional four VLANs that\n\n98\n00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:56.175\nwe see right here as well, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:56.175 --> 00:06:01.194\nAnd when you take a look at it,\nit begins with really 1002, right?\n\n100\n00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:05.179\nAnd you actually see in the name of it,\nwhich is kind of neat here,\n\n101\n00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:07.288\nyou see where it says FDDI, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:07.288 --> 00:06:10.953\nToken ring, and then FDDI Inet here, and\n\n103\n00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:15.700\nthen also of course TR net,\nwhatever that is, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.680\nNow when you start seeing\nany of this information.\n\n105\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.280\nSo you might be wondering,\nwhat is this about?\n\n106\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.566\nWell let's go back to our\nbase knowledge again,\n\n107\n00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:26.930\nI wanna go back to the LSR model just\nbriefly for a moment here, Daniel.\n\n108\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.153\nWhen we do this right, remember\nwhen we talked about layer 2, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:30.153 --> 00:06:34.241\nIn the OSI model layer 2 doesn't\njust mean for you and me,\n\n110\n00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:38.130\nright, MAC addresses and\nstuff like that, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.910\nLayer 2 information can\nactually be anything.\n\n112\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.630\nSo it includes that Ethernet which,\nactually for us logically,\n\n113\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.658\nis the MAC address.\n\n114\n00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:49.517\nBut layer 2 though, Cisco was\nactually built during that time and\n\n115\n00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:54.052\nit said look, I don't wanna\nlimit myself to TCP/IP, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:58.873\nSo, cuz I'm not gonna limit myself to\nTCP/IP I'll also VLANs in here that\n\n117\n00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:03.695\nwill support other layer 1 and\nthen layer 2 technologies, such as FDDI,\n\n118\n00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:07.457\nsuch as token ring,\nsuch as all these other ones in there.\n\n119\n00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:12.940\nAnd so they actually have their own VLANs\nset up for even networks like that, okay?\n\n120\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.679\nBut the rest of these, right, are pretty\nmuch gonna be, at least at this point,\n\n121\n00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:19.860\nthese are what we call legacy VLANs.\n\n122\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.937\nWe're really not going to use them for\nanything,\n\n123\n00:07:22.937 --> 00:07:25.287\nis what's gonna happen here, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:29.181\nSo that's why you're also seeing this\nbecause they're still around but\n\n125\n00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:31.271\nnobody really essentially uses this.\n\n126\n00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:35.569\nSo that brings us into his kind\nof weird gap here, Daniel,\n\n127\n00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:41.360\nbetween VLAN 1 and then VLAN 1,001 here,\nokay, is what we have.\n\n128\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.908\nAnd normally if you actually consider\nwhat they call normal range of VLANs,\n\n129\n00:07:46.908 --> 00:07:51.773\nit actually goes from VLAN 1\nall the way through VLAN 1,005.\n\n130\n00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:54.974\nEven though these last few\nhere are not gonna be used and\n\n131\n00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:59.359\nyou see that also underneath that\nstatus here, even though it's active,\n\n132\n00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:01.953\nnotice today they are unsupported, okay?\n\n133\n00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:06.297\nSo these aren't gonna be used,\nSo in all practicality,\n\n134\n00:08:06.297 --> 00:08:12.540\n1 all the way through 1,001,\nwe can create those VLAN numbers, okay?\n\n135\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.220\nAnd we can do that.\n\n136\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.280\nSo we can actually create VLAN,\nand then VLAN 2.\n\n137\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.030\nWe can do that all the way through\nVLAN 1,001, and we're perfectly fine.\n\n138\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.479\nOnce you start hitting 1,002 you might get\nsome weird message where it's like you're\n\n139\n00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.620\nrunning TCP/IP, yeah, you're probably\nnot gonna wanna create that.\n\n140\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.130\nBut can you?\n\n141\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.100\nYes, if you wanted to, you can do that.\n\n142\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.190\nBut at this point you're probably\nnot gonna see that too often, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.150\nSo it is still there and available for us.\n\n144\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.992\nNow there are two special VLANs\nthat are not listed here as well.\n\n145\n00:08:43.992 --> 00:08:49.680\nSo even though they're actually\nthere we don't use them.\n\n146\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.167\nThere is a VLAN zero and\nthere's a VLAN 4,095 that's there but\n\n147\n00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:57.488\nthose are reserved, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:57.488 --> 00:08:59.763\nYou and are not gonna end\nup using them for anything,\n\n149\n00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:01.510\nthose were kind of the default.\n\n150\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:08.270\nSo in theory it could support\nup to 4,096 VLANs are possible.\n\n151\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.910\nYou might wonder like, where the heck\nare these numbers coming from?\n\n152\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.006\nWell, this is 2 to the 16th\npower is the idea.\n\n153\n00:09:15.006 --> 00:09:17.689\nIt's actually the, [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n154\n00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:22.009\nis actually that idea of those\nbits that we're talking about.\n\n155\n00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:27.275\nActually, I'm lying to you, it's not 16,\n4,096 is 12th or something?\n\n156\n00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.717\nSo I'm lying to you, it's at the 12th.\n\n157\n00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:30.348\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's 2 to the 12th power,\n\n158\n00:09:30.348 --> 00:09:32.395\nthat's what actually ends up happening.\n\n159\n00:09:32.395 --> 00:09:36.549\nSo once you get to 512,\nI know that that's to the 9th power and\n\n160\n00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:42.240\nthen 1,024 is 12th,\n13th power somewhere around there.\n\n161\n00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.770\nBut in theory you can create those,\nbut not all the time, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.840\nOnce you get past 1,001 you go look,\nI need more VLANs at more than likely,\n\n163\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.860\nyou're hitting this network range of like,\nI have to have 1,000 VLANs.\n\n164\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.651\nSomething is insane here-\n&gt;&gt; If you got a 1,000 VLANs,\n\n165\n00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:03.621\nyou have got a large network my friend.\n\n166\n00:10:03.621 --> 00:10:06.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's weird, right?\n\n167\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.385\nBecause see at this level we're, so what?\n\n168\n00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:12.300\n1,000 VLANs and it's not gonna really\nmake sense to you why that's such a weird\n\n169\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.460\nnumber until you starting chaining\nmultiple switches together, and\n\n170\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.520\nwe actually have a protocol that prevents\nloops called spanning tree protocol.\n\n171\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.660\nWell, one of those switches every\nsingle frame has to pass through.\n\n172\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.090\nSo on that one switch,\nif you had 1,000 VLAN,\n\n173\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:38.510\nthen that particular one switch became\nthe center of that spanning tree protocol.\n\n174\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.140\nI mean, that means every single\npacket from 1,000 VLANs.\n\n175\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.100\nIt doesn't matter if it has\nto go through 1,500 switches,\n\n176\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.380\nit's all got to be\nfiltered through that one.\n\n177\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.780\nSo that's why,\nwhen Daniel you're kind of insane,\n\n178\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.170\nit's because nobody wants to do that.\n\n179\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.070\nBut normally for the majority of us\n1 through 1,001 technically through\n\n180\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.600\n1,005 that's what's\ncalled the normal range.\n\n181\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.820\nBut then beginning with 1,006\nthrough 4,094 you actually what\n\n182\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.130\nis called an extended range of VLANs.\n\n183\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.890\nNow can you use those?\n\n184\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.390\nYes, but only when you are in\na multiple switch configuration.\n\n185\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.930\nAnd only when you're actually\nrunning VTP version 3,\n\n186\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.720\nwhich is\nVirtual Trunking Protocol Version 3.\n\n187\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.450\nSo they won't even show up in\nthe other virtual trunking protocols,\n\n188\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.020\nwhich is version 1 and 2.\n\n189\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.290\nWhich of course version 1 and 2 are more\npopular than version 4, so go figure.\n\n190\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.059\nBut those are possibilities and\n\n191\n00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:34.408\nwe're not really worried about\nthe idea of extended VLANs.\n\n192\n00:11:34.408 --> 00:11:36.443\nSo we're gonna stick to the normal ranges,\n\n193\n00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:39.330\nis what we're gonna stick to\nmake sure that we understand it.\n\n194\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.530\nBut that's just kind of the idea\n\n195\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.942\nof what we have when you start\nseeing some of the information.\n\n196\n00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.300\nAll right, so now Daniel,\n\n197\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.330\nnow that I've talked again instead of\nshowing you a lot more information.\n\n198\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.088\nIt is the basis though, there's always a\nlot of question like, well why do we have\n\n199\n00:11:55.088 --> 00:11:58.300\nthese other ones and it's because\nthey've just always been there for\n\n200\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.947\nthose other protocols that exist.\n\n201\n00:11:59.947 --> 00:12:02.370\nSo why not learn a bit more?\n\n202\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.384\n&gt;&gt; Backwards compatibility, you never know\nwhat network you're going to get into-\n\n203\n00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:06.944\n&gt;&gt; Daniel just threw\n\n204\n00:12:06.944 --> 00:12:08.143\nout token rings at some point in time.\n\n205\n00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:12.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where's my mouse?\n\n206\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n207\n00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.240\n&gt;&gt; Why is it running backwards?\n\n208\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.200\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, so that's what happens.\n\n209\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.990\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nstart configuring some VLANs.\n\n210\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.484\nWe're gonna create two different\nVLANs on this NY core 1.\n\n211\n00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:26.866\nWe're gonna also assign the name to them,\n\n212\n00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:30.950\nwe're gonna call one of them\nmanagement and the other one sales.\n\n213\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.820\nWe're also gonna create VLAN 10 and\n\n214\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.250\nVLAN 20 respectively,\nis what we're going to do.\n\n215\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.532\nSo the great thing is creating\nVLANs is actually very easy to do.\n\n216\n00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:44.038\nSo we're doing the two-step method\nat the very beginning here, but\n\n217\n00:12:44.038 --> 00:12:48.028\nI also want to remind you you have to make\nsure that both steps are completed when\n\n218\n00:12:48.028 --> 00:12:49.128\nyou do this, right?\n\n219\n00:12:49.128 --> 00:12:52.770\nSo at the very beginning, let's go\ninto our global configuration mode.\n\n220\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.700\nI'm gonna go into my typing box here.\n\n221\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.410\nSo I'm gonna do configure terminal,\nand once I'm in here,\n\n222\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.400\nI can now actually type in a very\nsimple command, which is VLAN.\n\n223\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.680\nAnd then I'm gonna do a question mark so\nthat we can see this, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.230\nRight away when you take a look,\n\n225\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.630\nand I typed in VLAN I wanna\nknow what comes next.\n\n226\n00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.050\nHere's something else that we may\nnot have actually encountered yet\n\n227\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.760\nat this point either because I've gone too\nfast through some of the early labs or\n\n228\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.410\nyou're looking at it and you're wondering.\n\n229\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.540\nNotice the very first one that shows up,\nwhich is WORD, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:34.890\nSo when you see the word WORD, but\nit's all in capital letters, it's\n\n231\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:40.260\nnot saying this is the syntax you type in,\nwhich is W-O-R-D in capital letters.\n\n232\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.450\nIt's saying you can actually type in-\n&gt;&gt; Anything, right?\n\n233\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah pretty much anything yeah.\n\n234\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.420\nFor us it actually says here, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.460\nThis is what you're actually\ngonna type is a VLAN ID,\n\n236\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.290\nbetween 1 through 4,094.\n\n237\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.020\nSo in theory,\n\n238\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.700\nyou can at least on this particular\nswitch it says it will support it.\n\n239\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.610\nAnd you might be wondering like,\n\n240\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.790\nwell Ronnie you said only through\n1,001 technically, right?\n\n241\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.993\nWell, that is because this\nswitch right here will support\n\n242\n00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:16.312\nwhat we call BTP layer 3, or\nnot layer 3, BTP version 3.\n\n243\n00:14:16.312 --> 00:14:18.200\nAnd if I were to do that, right?\n\n244\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.203\nOnce I get to that idea of 4,096 here,\nthis switch will also have\n\n245\n00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:28.136\nto act independently as well which\nis called DTP transparent mode.\n\n246\n00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:31.172\nNow if you're like holy crap,\ndid I need the note no?\n\n247\n00:14:31.172 --> 00:14:32.405\nOkay don't worry about.\n\n248\n00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:35.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When we get into of course CCNA, yes.\n\n249\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.010\nWe'll have to do with\na little bit more and\n\n250\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.930\none labs that we're actually doing\na little bit later on even in this CCEMT,\n\n251\n00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.200\nit involves setting up DTP but\non a very small scale here.\n\n252\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.460\nBut just realize that you will see\nsome things that may be a little bit\n\n253\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.570\ndifferent than what you're seeing.\n\n254\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.300\nThe rest of all this though,\nas you start looking through here,\n\n255\n00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.840\nthese that are in lowercase letters,\nthey are syntax.\n\n256\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.200\nSo if you do want type them, and you can\nabbreviate them and it will actually work\n\n257\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.590\nas long as it can actually\nrecognize it as being unambiguous.\n\n258\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.150\nSo you might end up typing in\nall the way through access and\n\n259\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.293\na dash here and it's still ambiguous.\n\n260\n00:15:14.293 --> 00:15:16.918\nI still don't know which\none yo're referring to, and\n\n261\n00:15:16.918 --> 00:15:19.658\nthat's because there's\na possibility that you could be\n\n262\n00:15:19.658 --> 00:15:23.340\nreferring to what both of these\nare actually possibilities here.\n\n263\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.490\nSo you'd have to go a little bit further,\nyou might have to type in an L and\n\n264\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.056\nthen goes okay, I recognize that.\n\n265\n00:15:28.056 --> 00:15:35.630\nBut for here, you could even do price C or\nCON or even D at this point or .1q.\n\n266\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.200\nFilter group, internal, all of that,\nthat's pretty much possible, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.200\nSo let's go and create those respective\nVLANS with the ID numbers that we're gonna\n\n268\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.710\nassociate with them.\n\n269\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.958\nBut right now,\nI'm gonna type in VLAN 10, and\n\n270\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:52.951\nonce I do that note the actual prompt\nthat you're seeing it changed again,\n\n271\n00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:57.570\nand now we're inside of the configuration\nfor the VLAN here, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:02.687\nNow what the configuration or the VLAN,\nif I do a question mark at this point,\n\n273\n00:16:02.687 --> 00:16:07.805\nand I press Enter Now notice that there's\na lot more options in here that we can\n\n274\n00:16:07.805 --> 00:16:13.200\nalso create, but for us we're not gonna\nget into any of that for right now.\n\n275\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.086\nWhat we're actually going to\ndo is use only one of them,\n\n276\n00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:18.998\nwhich is gonna be the name.\n\n277\n00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:23.924\nAnd notice that they say as the ASCII\nvalue or the ASCII name of the VLAN.\n\n278\n00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:26.533\nAnd so it's saying, yeah, just type in\nsome alphanumeric characters there.\n\n279\n00:16:26.533 --> 00:16:30.386\nSo we do need to type in name,\noops, name and\n\n280\n00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:35.817\nthen from that point,\nI'm gonna call this one sales, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:35.817 --> 00:16:38.430\nDepending on the age of the switch, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.899\nAs well you could generally go ahead and\ntype in your next VLAN number, so\n\n283\n00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:45.994\nlike VLAN20, if I wanted to and\nit will take it.\n\n284\n00:16:45.994 --> 00:16:48.825\nBut I found out something with this\nswitch, it does not like that.\n\n285\n00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:49.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n286\n00:16:49.856 --> 00:16:53.350\nSo on this one it's gonna\nforce me to type in exit.\n\n287\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.852\nSo I get out to the global\nconfiguration mode and then VLAN20.\n\n288\n00:16:57.852 --> 00:17:04.114\nAnd then I can do name and\nthis one we're going to call management.\n\n289\n00:17:04.114 --> 00:17:09.186\nNow, now I've created two vlans\nwith two different names on them.\n\n290\n00:17:09.186 --> 00:17:12.762\nNow, Daniel, I'm gonna create\none more [INAUDIBLE] here, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:12.762 --> 00:17:16.336\nCuz I wanna do something else that's\nkinda a little bit unusual as well.\n\n292\n00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:19.994\nSo I'm just gonna take a random\none here which is gonna be VLAN70,\n\n293\n00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:23.150\ncuz I don't think I'm actually\nusing that range, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.535\nNow, Daniel now that\nI've taken also VLAN70,\n\n295\n00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:30.413\nwhat do you guess would happen\nif I didn't give it a name.\n\n296\n00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:32.957\nWhat do you think would happen here\nif I just didn't give it a name?\n\n297\n00:17:32.957 --> 00:17:35.768\n&gt;&gt; I think that it would\njust not have a name.\n\n298\n00:17:35.768 --> 00:17:39.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might not have a name or\nprobably system generated.\n\n299\n00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:39.553\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense?\n\n300\n00:17:39.553 --> 00:17:40.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n301\n00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:42.083\nthat's what you'll end up seeing.\n\n302\n00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:45.934\nSo sometimes it may be you're like me,\nyou're in a hurry, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:50.671\nAnd you just go, okay, VLAN 10, VLAN 20,\nVLAN 30, you just keep going, right?\n\n304\n00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:54.742\nAnd then you go, my gosh, I was supposed\nto name these things to make it easier to\n\n305\n00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:56.633\nmanage in the future, but I didn't.\n\n306\n00:17:56.633 --> 00:17:57.564\nI didn't do any of that.\n\n307\n00:17:57.564 --> 00:17:58.472\n&gt;&gt; Shame, shame, Ronnie.\n\n308\n00:17:58.472 --> 00:18:00.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's when you have to go back,\n\n309\n00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.794\nespecially if you do, if you have a well\ndocumented network, you're gonna go back\n\n310\n00:18:03.794 --> 00:18:07.044\nand you're gonna type all that stuff in,\nand then you're gonna do that.\n\n311\n00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.827\nBut let's say that we've just done this,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:09.923\nWhich is fine.\n\n313\n00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:10.970\nLet me get back on here.\n\n314\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.829\nNow, I'm going to do a little bit\nof a shortcut and type in do,\n\n315\n00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:17.422\nand then show VLAN.\n\n316\n00:18:17.422 --> 00:18:21.299\nThis time I'm gonna add in a modifier,\nwhich is the word brief.\n\n317\n00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:25.246\nSo remember how we showed a lot of all the\nstuff a little bit earlier when we were\n\n318\n00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:25.931\nusing this.\n\n319\n00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:28.949\nAnd we showed you how, look at that,\nhere's the entire database.\n\n320\n00:18:28.949 --> 00:18:32.293\nIt shows us some other things that we're\nactually gonna see here that we don't\n\n321\n00:18:32.293 --> 00:18:32.910\nreally need.\n\n322\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.805\nRemote span VLANs as well,\nand primary secondary stuff.\n\n323\n00:18:36.805 --> 00:18:41.327\nWe're gonna get to all that but a little\nbit later, not in this particular series,\n\n324\n00:18:41.327 --> 00:18:43.338\nbut in other series as we get to them.\n\n325\n00:18:43.338 --> 00:18:47.608\nBut for right now,\nI'm just gonna type in do show VLAN brief.\n\n326\n00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:52.731\nI'm gonna press Enter, and now notice it\nreally does truncate everything down,\n\n327\n00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:55.566\nand only gives me\nthe relevant information.\n\n328\n00:18:55.566 --> 00:19:00.264\nSo Daniel, at this point the VLANs that\nyou and I have created here, okay?\n\n329\n00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:06.362\nThey show up just about exactly as I type\nthem in except for that last one, okay?\n\n330\n00:19:06.362 --> 00:19:11.615\nSo I did create VLAN70, but\nnow notice it generated this.\n\n331\n00:19:11.615 --> 00:19:12.248\n&gt;&gt; VLAN70.\n\n332\n00:19:12.248 --> 00:19:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Yep, wihich is VLAN70.\n\n333\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.290\nSo it does allow me to do this here in,\nand it's not only that though,\n\n334\n00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.156\nyou can also see like\nkind of unusual here.\n\n335\n00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:23.666\nIt's 00070, right?\n\n336\n00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:28.403\nIn doing that, and that's because there's\na certain amount of bits that this\n\n337\n00:19:28.403 --> 00:19:32.734\nparticular name space will allow you\nto take up as you create this name.\n\n338\n00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:36.659\nSo here, it will give you this you\nknow ability to do that as well.\n\n339\n00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:40.515\nSo if you don't type in a name for\nVLAN70, here's what it will do,\n\n340\n00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:43.718\nit will generally show up as\na default like this instead.\n\n341\n00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:46.572\nSo if I wanted to add in a name for that,\n\n342\n00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:51.854\nthen I could just type in VLAN70,\ngo ahead and get back in that mode.\n\n343\n00:19:51.854 --> 00:19:56.076\nAnd then I could do a name, and this time\nwe'll call it, we'll call it Daniel for\n\n344\n00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:57.087\nyou, how's that?\n\n345\n00:19:57.087 --> 00:20:00.042\nWe'll call it Daniel,\n\n346\n00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:05.867\njust as an example here,\ndo show vlan brief.\n\n347\n00:20:05.867 --> 00:20:07.245\nIt helps if I could spell brief.\n\n348\n00:20:10.517 --> 00:20:14.927\nOop, well maybe I'm lying to you,\nit does not like your name,\n\n349\n00:20:14.927 --> 00:20:17.354\nas actually it did not overwrite.\n\n350\n00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:22.232\nI was expecting it to actually\noverwrite the name that was given here.\n\n351\n00:20:22.232 --> 00:20:24.410\nSo this one is saying,\nno, I don't like it.\n\n352\n00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.124\nSo, do I have to try and\nthen get rid of that?\n\n353\n00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:28.111\n&gt;&gt; Like the VLAN?\n\n354\n00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:28.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe,\n\n355\n00:20:28.887 --> 00:20:32.895\nI'd have to delete the actual VLAN itself\nwhich is actually a good thing for us.\n\n356\n00:20:32.895 --> 00:20:35.828\nWhat if you don't want VLAN70,\nwhich is probably better for us?\n\n357\n00:20:35.828 --> 00:20:41.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So no VLAN70, and\nthat's pretty much it, at least I think.\n\n358\n00:20:41.193 --> 00:20:43.081\nSo do show-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n359\n00:20:43.081 --> 00:20:44.521\n&gt;&gt; I know, VLAN brief.\n\n360\n00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:47.588\nI was really expecting it to\noverwrite that name here.\n\n361\n00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:48.645\nAnd there you go-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n362\n00:20:48.645 --> 00:20:51.394\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\nSo VLAN 70, you can remove VLAN,\n\n363\n00:20:51.394 --> 00:20:53.040\nyou can create a VLAN.\n\n364\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.635\nSome reason the name didn't\noverwrite the default name.\n\n365\n00:20:55.635 --> 00:20:59.598\n&gt;&gt; What if you tried to recreate VLAN70\nwith my name during the time of creation?\n\n366\n00:20:59.598 --> 00:21:00.224\n&gt;&gt; That would work.\n\n367\n00:21:00.224 --> 00:21:02.558\n&gt;&gt; That would work?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I thought, I really did,\n\n368\n00:21:02.558 --> 00:21:03.317\nI really did.\n\n369\n00:21:03.317 --> 00:21:05.573\nI really believed that I could go\nback in and just rename it, but\n\n370\n00:21:05.573 --> 00:21:06.564\napparently you cannot so.\n\n371\n00:21:06.564 --> 00:21:07.377\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n372\n00:21:07.377 --> 00:21:08.100\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n373\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.546\n&gt;&gt; Before it might be one of\nthose like on this version or\n\n374\n00:21:10.546 --> 00:21:11.501\non this switch-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:14.207\n&gt;&gt; You can't, and on this one you can.\n\n376\n00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:15.966\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is kind of one of those unusual ones.\n\n377\n00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:19.742\nLike I said because I remember doing\nthis on switches where it didn't matter.\n\n378\n00:21:19.742 --> 00:21:20.880\nYou could actually just type in\n\n379\n00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.255\nthe next VLAN without having to do-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n380\n00:21:22.255 --> 00:21:24.306\n&gt;&gt; Exit all the time and just continue on.\n\n381\n00:21:24.306 --> 00:21:28.279\nBut this one is a little bit more\ntricky than I thought it was gonna be.\n\n382\n00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:32.053\nAll right, so Daniel, I've gotten\nthat one ready to go, so that's fine.\n\n383\n00:21:32.053 --> 00:21:36.408\nNow what I want to do though is I want\nto verify that I have good connectivity\n\n384\n00:21:36.408 --> 00:21:38.384\nthroughout this network so far.\n\n385\n00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:40.181\nSo if I click on NYEDGE1,\n\n386\n00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:45.840\nthis is actually going to be a route that\nconnects all the way through to NYCORE1.\n\n387\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.316\nAnd then other devices are off of that\none that we just configured here with\n\n388\n00:21:50.316 --> 00:21:52.347\nthe VLANs on them as well, okay?\n\n389\n00:21:52.347 --> 00:21:58.386\nSo from here I'm simply gonna issue\nseveral pings is what we're gonna do.\n\n390\n00:21:58.386 --> 00:22:02.904\nI'm gonna type in ping 192.168 16.2, and\n\n391\n00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:07.431\nthen in a moment here we\nshould get some connectivity.\n\n392\n00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:12.330\nRemember that a lot of times that first or\nsecond one, it has to do the arp apply,\n\n393\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.979\nso that is a successful\nping at this point.\n\n394\n00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:19.360\nAnd then if I ping 19216816.3,\n\n395\n00:22:22.056 --> 00:22:27.026\nAnd we'll see here, let's see what happens\nhere, And this time, and I dropped\n\n396\n00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:30.423\ntwo pings and probably because it actually\nwent across a couple of devices there and\n\n397\n00:22:30.423 --> 00:22:35.363\nthen we'll do one more, 16.4, and\n\n398\n00:22:35.363 --> 00:22:39.366\nlet's see what happens here on this one.\n\n399\n00:22:39.366 --> 00:22:41.188\nThis one looks like there's\ngonna be a problem.\n\n400\n00:22:41.188 --> 00:22:41.688\nThere.\n&gt;&gt; I guess.\n\n401\n00:22:41.688 --> 00:22:42.917\n&gt;&gt; It actually did work.\n\n402\n00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:43.520\n&gt;&gt; It's working.\n\n403\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.148\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel, I just said that VLANs, and\n\n404\n00:22:46.148 --> 00:22:51.008\nI said when we try and actually between\nVLANs on the same switch on earlier\n\n405\n00:22:51.008 --> 00:22:52.455\nepisode.\nI said what?\n\n406\n00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:53.322\nIt wouldn't work.\n\n407\n00:22:53.322 --> 00:22:53.918\n&gt;&gt; It would not\n\n408\n00:22:53.918 --> 00:22:54.512\nwork so-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n409\n00:22:54.512 --> 00:22:55.298\nDaniel-\n&gt;&gt; Riddle me\n\n410\n00:22:55.298 --> 00:22:55.804\nthat Batman.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n411\n00:22:55.804 --> 00:22:57.042\n&gt;&gt; Why is this working?\n\n412\n00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:57.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so-\n\n413\n00:22:57.906 --> 00:22:58.854\n&gt;&gt; I'll assume it's because\n\n414\n00:22:58.854 --> 00:23:01.459\nwe don't have IP addressing and\nthings of that nature happening just yet.\n\n415\n00:23:01.459 --> 00:23:02.546\n&gt;&gt; Well it's not only that.\n\n416\n00:23:02.546 --> 00:23:05.010\nLets do this again.\n\n417\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.852\nShow VLAN, and we'll do brief again,\n\n418\n00:23:08.852 --> 00:23:13.664\n&gt;&gt; Do show.\n\n419\n00:23:13.664 --> 00:23:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, that should-\n&gt;&gt; Ambiguous command, show VLAN.\n\n420\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.232\n&gt;&gt; That should be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that should [INAUDIBLE]\n\n421\n00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.367\n&gt;&gt; Let me see, maybe wait.\n\n422\n00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:23.956\nI'm on NYEDGE, that's why.\n\n423\n00:23:23.956 --> 00:23:28.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I told you,\non a router, it does not work.\n\n424\n00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:28.663\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n425\n00:23:28.663 --> 00:23:30.445\n&gt;&gt; That's like, yeah,\nthat's not gonna work here.\n\n426\n00:23:30.445 --> 00:23:36.619\n&gt;&gt; So do show VLAN brief.\n\n427\n00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:40.700\nNow hey, Ronnie, that's not even\na device that holds VLANs, how's that?\n\n428\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.749\nAll right, so Daniel.\n\n429\n00:23:41.749 --> 00:23:42.511\n&gt;&gt; I already see them now.\n\n430\n00:23:42.511 --> 00:23:43.393\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what's the problem?\n\n431\n00:23:43.393 --> 00:23:47.024\n&gt;&gt; The problem is is that all\nthe ports are on the same VLAN.\n\n432\n00:23:47.024 --> 00:23:48.351\nSo yeah, they're gonna talk.\n\n433\n00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:52.209\n&gt;&gt; Right, so right now remember,\nthat's what I was trying to emphasize.\n\n434\n00:23:52.209 --> 00:23:55.965\nYou have to create the VLANs, and\nthat's not the end of the process.\n\n435\n00:23:55.965 --> 00:24:00.006\nThe next part of process is we actually\nassign those ports into each of\n\n436\n00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:00.848\nthose VLANs.\n\n437\n00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:03.209\nAnd if I did that and\nI try to ping again at that point,\n\n438\n00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:05.640\nthen some of them might work,\nsome of them might not.\n\n439\n00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Some of them might not.\n\n440\n00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.192\n&gt;&gt; It depends on what port is actually in\nwhat VLAN as we start seeing this, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:11.192 --> 00:24:15.584\nSo Daniel that does lead us to\nthe actual parts that we need to.\n\n442\n00:24:15.584 --> 00:24:19.745\nWhich is now we need to\nconfigure the idea here, right?\n\n443\n00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:24.325\nOf these ports going\ninto either VLAN10 and\n\n444\n00:24:24.325 --> 00:24:27.584\n20 for us to be able to do this.\n\n445\n00:24:27.584 --> 00:24:29.056\nSo we do need to do that, but\n\n446\n00:24:29.056 --> 00:24:33.472\nDaniel I am actually at that point where\nit's just a couple of minutes into it, and\n\n447\n00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:36.174\nI know that I'd like to\ncontinue on if we did this.\n\n448\n00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.530\nSo it might be great for a part two.\n\n449\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not a problem Ronnie, we\nare always happy to be convinient for you.\n\n450\n00:24:41.592 --> 00:24:44.648\nAnd to make sure that the way in which\nyou demonstrate these things is the most\n\n451\n00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:45.188\neffective.\n\n452\n00:24:45.188 --> 00:24:48.444\nSo if another part is in order\nthen that is what my man gets.\n\n453\n00:24:48.444 --> 00:24:50.773\nHopefully, Ronnie,\nwe'll get everything squared away in that.\n\n454\n00:24:50.773 --> 00:24:52.768\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n455\n00:24:52.768 --> 00:24:54.691\nAnd hey, we thank you for\nwatching as well.\n\n456\n00:24:54.691 --> 00:24:56.969\nWe're gonna call quits on this and\ncome back for part two.\n\n457\n00:24:56.969 --> 00:24:58.815\nAnd watch Ronnie drop some ports-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n458\n00:24:58.815 --> 00:24:59.806\n&gt;&gt; On some VLANs.\n\n459\n00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:02.600\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n460\n00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.599\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n461\n00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:04.450\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n462\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:11.869\n[MUSIC]\n\n463\n00:25:11.869 --> 00:25:14.326\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:13.758\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:16.270\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.430\nI'm your host and as always,\nI'm Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.650\nin today's episode we're gonna be\nlooking at out CCENT series, yet again.\n\n7\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.790\nAlways so much fun.\n\n8\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.420\nJoining us back in the studio to\nhave a little bit of fun with us,\n\n9\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.720\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.280\nRonnie, glad to have you back,\nman, ready for the party?\n\n11\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.840\n&gt;&gt; We are ready for\nthe party here as we continue on,\n\n12\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.880\ntaking a look at another\npart of our series here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.700\nAnd we are in the middle of the lab and\nI think I mistakenly said that this was\n\n14\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.770\na part two at the end of\nour last episode together.\n\n15\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.810\nSo, now if you're wondering,\nlike, what happened,\n\n16\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.150\nit's because I did make a mistake.\n\n17\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.520\nThis is a part three is what this should\nbe and exactly what the title says.\n\n18\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.580\nSo, you're not making mistake,\nyou didn't skip something.\n\n19\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.676\nAnd somewhere-\n&gt;&gt; How'd we land on three?\n\n20\n00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how that happen,\n\n21\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.830\nbut that's exactly what happened here,\nokay, is I just made a mistake.\n\n22\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.680\nSo, we have just configured the idea\nof VLANs, right, on the switch, but\n\n23\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.580\nremember that there's two parts to\nusing VLANs inside your network.\n\n24\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.890\nOne, you have to configure those VLANs\nmake sure that they are on the switch and\n\n25\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.920\nthen, secondly you also need to\nassign ports to those VLANs.\n\n26\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.810\nWithout assigning ports to those\nVLANs it doesn't really matter\n\n27\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.980\nbecause those devices they'll still be,\nat least all the ports on them,\n\n28\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.850\nthey'll still be plugged in to VLAN\n1 which is the default VLAN, but\n\n29\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.870\nnot inside your VLANs to separate them\nout into an own broadcast, I mean.\n\n30\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.870\nSo, that's our goal at this point and\nthen,\n\n31\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.950\nwe'll point out several other things,\nokay?\n\n32\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.510\nLet's take a look at my switch here, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.298\nNow I've added in something cuz I want you\nto see what this is going to look like.\n\n34\n00:01:45.298 --> 00:01:50.602\nSo, in between our break, here, okay,\nI did create that VLAN 70 that we were\n\n35\n00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:56.087\ntalking about this time, I added in the\nname production which is perfectly fine.\n\n36\n00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:59.718\nBut now you're seeing over\non the right hand side,\n\n37\n00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.344\nI also added in a switch port into it.\n\n38\n00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:05.776\nSo, our goal here,\nis to also create, well,\n\n39\n00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:09.923\nsome additional ports inside\nof these VLANs, as well.\n\n40\n00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:13.511\nWhat should happen is like if you\ntake a look at the list above,\n\n41\n00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:18.411\nif you go down through here you'll see\nwhere it actually does like Fa1/0/10,\n\n42\n00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:20.772\nit skips 11 and goes directly to 12.\n\n43\n00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:25.772\nSo, pulled from the default VLAN,\npulled it out of there and then,\n\n44\n00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:32.290\nalso ended up putting it in an Fa1/0/11\nand this is now been assigned to VLAN 70.\n\n45\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.030\nFor us, we're gonna actually\ncreate two additional ports\n\n46\n00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.220\nin each one of these VLANs right here, so\n\n47\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.250\nthat we can test that they're gonna keep\ntheir own separate broadcast domain.\n\n48\n00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.510\nAnd be able to actually only\nping within their own VLANs and\n\n49\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.450\nnot be able to ping across\nthose VLANs without help.\n\n50\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.165\nSo, that is what our goal is going to be.\n\n51\n00:02:54.165 --> 00:02:56.680\nSo, in the sales VLAN in VLAN 10,\n\n52\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.002\nwe're gonna add these first\ntwo ports in here, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:04.512\nFa1/0 and then Fa1/0/1,\n\n54\n00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:09.650\nFa1/0/2, okay, is what you're seeing.\n\n55\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.080\nSo, now let me get into\none of those interfaces.\n\n56\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.590\nSo, I do interface and then, Fa1/0/1.\n\n57\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.720\nSo, I'm using the abbreviation, you see,\nthat's what the official abbreviation\n\n58\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.493\nis here on this particular,\nin the screen that you'll see.\n\n59\n00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:29.960\nTrying to think of what that is called,\n\n60\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.200\nare the ports that it's listing, that's\njust an abbreviation for fast ethernet.\n\n61\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.030\nThen, I need do a switch port mode, then,\nI'm gonna do a question mark, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.800\nNotice that there's multiple options here,\naccess.one Q tunnel,\n\n63\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.490\ndynamic private VLAN trans.\n\n64\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.760\nAt this point, we're only concerned\nwith two options, the first and\n\n65\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.190\nthe last option here, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.420\nThe first option is access, access means\nthat you're gonna be plugging in and\n\n67\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.690\nsome type of end point device, a laptop,\na compute work station, a server,\n\n68\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.615\nsomething like that, that's gonna be\nwhat we call an access type of port.\n\n69\n00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:10.720\nWe're not expecting it to\ndo anything else to try and\n\n70\n00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.710\nnegotiate anything with another device,\nwe're just saying, we're just allowing for\n\n71\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.210\naccess to this switch, okay,\nthat is what we want to do.\n\n72\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.180\nThe other one is a trunk, when you say\nset trunking mode and if you do this,\n\n73\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.790\nnotice the term unconditionally,\nhere, okay and notice that,\n\n74\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.020\nI should have emphasized that, as well.\n\n75\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.820\nThe term, unconditionally, what this is\nsaying is you're hard setting it, okay,\n\n76\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.200\nyou might wanna know like,\nwhy are we doing that?\n\n77\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.270\nWell, in an earlier episode, we talked\nabout the idea on some of the evil natures\n\n78\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.220\nof the automatic configurations,\nsomething like that.\n\n79\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.590\nWell, the way that switches work,\n\n80\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.080\nin default-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n81\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Every port really wants\nto become a trunk, okay,\n\n82\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.070\nevery single port wants to be a trunk,\nevery single port can be a trunk, but\n\n83\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.480\nit doesn't necessarily mean it should be,\nokay?\n\n84\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.690\nAnd the goal is fairly simple,\nif you actually\n\n85\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.660\njust take this port whatever port it is\nand you plug something into it without\n\n86\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.600\nconfiguring anything,it's gonna try and\ndefault and change it into a trunk.\n\n87\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.230\nSo, when does it change into a trunk?\n\n88\n00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.560\nNormally, when I plug it into another\nswitch that is also doing the same thing,\n\n89\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.108\nbecause both sides want\nto become a trunk and\n\n90\n00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:27.550\nif it does that means we can now\nstart passing multiple VLANs across\n\n91\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.360\nthose two switches\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n92\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.010\nthere's sort of a default to try to\ncommunicate with each other, so it can\n\n93\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.750\npass any information from one switch\nto the next with very much ease, right?\n\n94\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you've got it right,\nthat the idea of easy right?\n\n95\n00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:41.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right out of the box\n\n96\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.640\nyou think about the way\nthat CISCO has this right?\n\n97\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.690\nThere's no on switch,\nthey just say plug it in-\n\n98\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.350\n&gt;&gt; It turns on.\n\n99\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.110\n&gt;&gt; It turns on and\n\n100\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.260\nwhen you turn it on, the next thing is,\nlook at these ports here.\n\n101\n00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.510\nLet me plug a cable into it and\nthey're on by default.\n\n102\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.028\nSo, this thing too, it says look, if you\nchoose to now link it to another switch,\n\n103\n00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:01.420\nit doesn't want you to also have\nto wait for the configuration.\n\n104\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.570\nIt says, if you plug these two\nswitches together with a cable, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.490\nWell, when you do that,\n\n106\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.190\nit's like, hey, I'm actually receiving the\ninformation that says, that side wants to\n\n107\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.120\nbecome a trunk, I want to become a trunk,\nwe're agreed, let's become a trunk.\n\n108\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.860\n&gt;&gt; So, by default,\nare these switches coming,\n\n109\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.550\nI'm looking at the list of\noptions that we have and\n\n110\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.130\nI know you said we're gonna, basically,\nhover around access and trunk.\n\n111\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But, it does have dynamic there,\n\n112\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.380\nis that what it's doing by default,\nsaying, hey, if you plug in a workstation,\n\n113\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.120\nthen I'm gonna default to an access-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n114\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.930\n&gt;&gt; But if you plug in another switch,\nI'm trunking it up, baby.\n\n115\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's what's happening,\nis that, that way.\n\n116\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.010\nSo, usually, what we want to do here,\nof course, so\n\n117\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.780\nthat we don't get that idea is that\nyou want to configure your devices or\n\n118\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.400\nyour reports that you're putting in your\nVLANs to not do any type of dynamic.\n\n119\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.010\nWhat you're actually wanting them to do,\nof course,\n\n120\n00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.780\nis actually have it hard set this way.\n\n121\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.830\nSo, that way somebody\ncan't plug in a device and\n\n122\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.970\nthen it auto negotiate to\na trunk is what you don't want.\n\n123\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.270\nBecause when you auto negotiate to a trunk\nthat means VLAN traffic flows across that.\n\n124\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.470\nSomebody is smarter than me, somebody\nsmarter than probably you, what they can\n\n125\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.490\ndo, then do, right, is to have a device\nthat says, I'm gonna emulate a trunk port.\n\n126\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.120\nAnd when they do that,\n\n127\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.942\nnow all of your VLAN traffic, multiple\nVLANs are now gonna flow across that.\n\n128\n00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:21.950\nAnd now someone like Daniel, has all of\nyour information on his own laptop ready\n\n129\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.710\nto scan, ready to do everything that\nhe wants to and it's simply not because\n\n130\n00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.300\nDaniel did any special voodoo hacking,\nit's because Daniel goes, I'm a trunk.\n\n131\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.340\n&gt;&gt; That switch over there,\n\n133\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.170\nI bet you it wants to become a trunk,\nand he plugs into it and\n\n134\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.221\nhe goes, all right,\nlet's set this to trunk, look at that.\n\n135\n00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.928\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n136\n00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.019\nIt's amazing, it really is amazing, but\n\n137\n00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:47.559\nit is because they want to make it easy so\nthey can be working right away and\n\n138\n00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:50.790\nthey believed that that was\nactually part of the deal.\n\n139\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.686\nSo, for us, we are going to\nmanually set this one up here.\n\n140\n00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:59.035\nSo, switchport mode trunk.\n\n141\n00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:00.393\nAccess.\n\n142\n00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:01.571\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Access Ronnie.\n\n143\n00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That would have been though,\nokay?\n\n144\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.890\nNow, I forgot to actually do,\nokay switch port mode access.\n\n145\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.590\nNow the second\n\n146\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.205\nthing is we also need to assign-\n&gt;&gt; Which prompt?\n\n147\n00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:14.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, gosh.\n\n148\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.860\nTell you might typing.\n\n149\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.626\nSwitch port access now and\nthen I type in the Vlan that I want to\n\n150\n00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:24.100\nassign it to which is VLAN 10, all right?\n\n151\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.584\nLet's do this one more time and\n\n152\n00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:36.185\nthis time I'm gonna do, interface fa1/0/2.\n\n153\n00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:42.495\nOops, interface fa1/0/2 and\nthe same thing, switch port mode access,\n\n154\n00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:47.960\nmake sure we get that in there and\nthen switch port access vlan10.\n\n155\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.620\nRight.\n\n156\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.380\nSo that will also put\nthat in there as well.\n\n157\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.464\nSo we want to do this two more times but\n\n158\n00:08:55.464 --> 00:08:59.314\nwe wanna put two other ports inside\nof VLAN 20 is what we want to do.\n\n159\n00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:05.024\nAnd we're gonna do this with the /22 and\n/24.\n\n160\n00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:09.912\nSo those are the ones that\nare connected to the other devices\n\n161\n00:09:09.912 --> 00:09:14.717\ninside of our network here,\ninterface fa1/0/22.\n\n162\n00:09:14.717 --> 00:09:21.276\nAnd then switchport mode access and\n\n163\n00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:27.839\nthen switchport access vlan 20.\n\n164\n00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.100\nI'm gonna do the same thing, interface.\n\n165\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.360\nNow Daniel, it seems a little\nbit repetitive at this point\n\n166\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.980\ncuz I'm having to do every single\none of these one at a time.\n\n167\n00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.060\nBut we do, we are going to show you in\na little bit how you can ask you configure\n\n168\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.740\nmultiple ports especially with same exact\nconfiguration on them with one command and\n\n169\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.780\nstaff the word and save that for\nsomething else but right now,\n\n170\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.344\nwe're just going to many\ndistracting is asking for\n\n171\n00:09:56.344 --> 00:10:02.158\nthe best thing you can do\nat this point here and\n\n172\n00:10:02.158 --> 00:10:07.920\nswitchport node access,\nswitchport access vlan 20.\n\n173\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.197\nAll right.\n\n174\n00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:15.819\nSo now I've got two ports in vlan 10 and\n\n175\n00:10:15.819 --> 00:10:21.619\ntwo ports in vlan 20 here,\nlet's verify, do show vlan breath.\n\n176\n00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.517\nAnd once I do that,\nI'm just checking it out and\n\n177\n00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:31.919\nverifying that these are the ports that\nare actually going to be inside of\n\n178\n00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:35.660\nthe different vlans when\nwe start to see this, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.800\nSo in theory now, I have to separate\nbroadcast domains that I have created in\n\n180\n00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.870\naddition of course to the default one that\nwe have a three if you count production\n\n181\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.350\nand not have anything\nplugged into that thing.\n\n182\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.390\nBut overall though,\nyou will see something like this.\n\n183\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:55.900\nSo now, let's see if we can well, use\none of the devices inside of one VLANs.\n\n184\n00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.660\nSo NYEDGE is actually one\nof those ports in VLAN 10.\n\n185\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.882\nSo if I click on NYEDGE here and\n\n186\n00:11:03.882 --> 00:11:08.350\nnow, I'll go ahead and press enter.\n\n187\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.180\nNow on this one, notice I'm on the user\nmode, when you see user mode here,\n\n188\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.540\ngo directly into the privileged\nexec mode to do even things.\n\n189\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.440\nYou don't have to.\n\n190\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.350\nSo if I'm not really getting into this\nmachine here or into this router.\n\n191\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:28.980\nI can just do 192.168.16 at\nthe beginning 2, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n192\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.865\nSo, I'm connected to whatever\nthat device is on 2 here and\n\n193\n00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:38.552\nif I use my guide a little bit,\nokay, so I pulled this up so\n\n194\n00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:43.562\nthat we can see this as well,\nso 16.2 thats NY1, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:46.240\nAnd so\nthat's where this one is connected to.\n\n196\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.058\nAnd then, if I also go to ping,\n\n197\n00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:56.976\n192.168.16.3, now,\n\n198\n00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:59.630\nit looks like it's not working.\n\n199\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:05.100\nSo let's see what device 16.3,\nas which as NYACCESS1, okay?\n\n200\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.200\nSo I can't get access to that thing.\n\n201\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:16.358\nAnd then, let's do one more which\nis we're gonna ping 192.168.16.4.\n\n202\n00:12:16.358 --> 00:12:19.080\nSee where this one gets me.\n\n203\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:26.240\nOkay, 16.4 here is NYCORE to,\nif I remember correctly what I just saw.\n\n204\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.770\nYep that's exactly what that one is.\n\n205\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.650\nSo one of those was actually able to\nrespond and that means it was in the same\n\n206\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.170\nVLAN, when it's not responding, it's\nnot actually in that same VLAN as well.\n\n207\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.970\nSo let's test it out on the other end.\n\n208\n00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:45.690\nNY access one was really that first\none that we didnt get a ping on.\n\n209\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.426\nSo this one we're assuming is\nactually in the other VLAN instead.\n\n210\n00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:53.918\nSo now,\nif I press enter a couple of times there,\n\n211\n00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:58.096\nI thought it was gonna\nlock up only your ping.\n\n212\n00:12:58.096 --> 00:13:02.095\n192.168.16.1.\n\n213\n00:13:02.095 --> 00:13:04.140\nSo I know this one is in vlan10.\n\n214\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.980\nAnd let's see here.\n\n215\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.690\nSo that looks like it has failed and\nI know that NY-access1 is actually in\n\n216\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.140\nvlan20, so I can see that because I'm\nnot really getting any replies back.\n\n217\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.281\nLet's try again verify.\n\n218\n00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:24.732\n192.168 and this is 16.2.\n\n219\n00:13:24.732 --> 00:13:27.930\nJust wanna make sure I'm\npointing out the right device.\n\n220\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:36.290\nSo that one was also, that NYlan1 which\nwas also in vlan 10, as far as I know.\n\n221\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.380\nAnd then we're gonna ping that 16.4.\n\n222\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:44.555\nSee what happens here 16.4.\n\n223\n00:13:44.555 --> 00:13:45.920\nAnd that one was successful, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.660\nSo, it does actually,\nat least allow you at this point, right?\n\n225\n00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.100\nThat when we are pinging within VLANs,\n\n226\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.520\nwe can ping the devices with inside of\nthe VLAN but not outside of the VLAN.\n\n227\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Which is the intention, right?\n\n228\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.070\nThat's the whole purpose\nof making the VLANs, right?\n\n229\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.950\n&gt;&gt; The idea if making the VLANs is to\nseperate out smaller broadcast domain for\n\n230\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.180\nus on that switch.\n\n231\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.850\nAs we've done, so\non the single switch, we've done that.\n\n232\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.090\nWe've now actually created\nmultiple broadcast domains\n\n233\n00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.170\nto help us do what we wanted to.\n\n234\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:14.820\nOkay?\n\n235\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.510\nNow, Daniel,\nwhen we start to take a look then,\n\n236\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.430\nwe still have that one VLAN\nthat's been sitting there\n\n237\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.710\nforever that we havent actually been able\nto modify or change or do anything with.\n\n238\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.530\nWhich is the default VLAN, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.130\nAnd that is the one that you're seeing\nright here at the top of the screen.\n\n240\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.260\nLet me see if I can scroll that.\n\n241\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.835\nScroll, not past it,\nwhich is not what I wanna do.\n\n242\n00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:36.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So remember that,\n\n243\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.660\nthere's the default VLAN which is VLAN 1,\nokay?\n\n244\n00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.460\nNow, even though at this point it is\nthe default VLAN that's because that's\n\n245\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.570\neactly what it is.\n\n246\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.810\nIt's just there by default here.\n\n247\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.930\nYou can change this if you want to, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.960\nRemember, the default VLAN also is\nconsidered what we call the native\n\n249\n00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.970\nVLAN as well, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.950\nAnd the reason why you want this,\nokay or why you have this,\n\n251\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.570\nright, is now that we are creating\nthese VLANs, okay, all the traffic,\n\n252\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.230\nif we start going in between switches,\nthey're going to be tagged.\n\n253\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.150\nAnd when they had that tagging on,\nitI means the other side is saying look,\n\n254\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.050\nif I don't see the tag,\nI'm not gonna let it come across here.\n\n255\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.440\nBut there is other\ntraffic that is untagged.\n\n256\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.780\nSo, when you actually\nsend untagged traffic,\n\n257\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.780\nit's going on the native Vlan as well.\n\n258\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.225\nThe default Vlan,\nif you take a look at right now,\n\n259\n00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.910\nyou'll also hear the term\nparking lot Vlan.\n\n260\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.700\nWhich means all of the ports\nare essentially parked right here.\n\n261\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.330\nOkay?\n\n262\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.930\nAnd when it does that, you just see where\nnow all of those ports are going to get\n\n263\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.180\nmoved out of it and then separated out\nto the VLANs that they're assigned to.\n\n264\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.857\nBut the problem that we have though\nDaniel, is that each one of these ports'\n\n265\n00:15:44.857 --> 00:15:48.893\ndefault VLAN, that's what is\nconfigured from Cisco to come at.\n\n266\n00:15:48.893 --> 00:15:51.452\nAnd that means when you plug a device in,\n\n267\n00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:56.280\nit's going to automatically get\naccess to all these other ports.\n\n268\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.662\nThat are also right here too, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:58.662 --> 00:16:01.380\nNow, that sounds like a great idea.\n\n270\n00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.180\nBut it's a terrible idea\nin terms of security\n\n271\n00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.920\nbecause if you just happen then\nto plug in another device,\n\n272\n00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.850\nlet's say Daniel plugs in his database\nserver right here to FK1-0-14.\n\n273\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.390\nAnd then, you bring Daniel along as well\nand his hacker friend of his is gonna get,\n\n274\n00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.150\nhey, look at that there's a server\nsitting right here in this default VLAN.\n\n275\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.120\nThat's because you didn't assign\nit to the proper VLAN, so\n\n276\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.560\nthat way, it's gonna automatically\nget to that access point.\n\n277\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:33.174\nSo what we normally do instead is that we\nchange this idea of that default VLAN so\n\n278\n00:16:33.174 --> 00:16:37.017\nthat we can switch it up\na little bit more here, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:37.017 --> 00:16:41.702\nSo we change that so that now,\nit's not gonna get you anything.\n\n280\n00:16:41.702 --> 00:16:43.671\nAnd the way that you do this, right?\n\n281\n00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:48.999\nIs that you actually end up creating\nanother VLAN here called VLAN 99.\n\n282\n00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:51.799\nNow, you can put whatever\nyou want to instead.\n\n283\n00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:57.726\nIf you wanna do, VLAN 999 that's fine.\n\n284\n00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:58.413\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n285\n00:16:58.413 --> 00:16:59.068\n&gt;&gt; It's fine.\n\n286\n00:16:59.068 --> 00:17:02.689\nThis is what we call the true parking\nlot VLAN as what we're gonna do.\n\n287\n00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:06.346\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna move\neverything out of the default VLAN which\n\n288\n00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:07.326\nis normally VLAN1.\n\n289\n00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:10.601\nCuz everybody just leaves it there and\nleaves all the ports open.\n\n290\n00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:11.845\nWe do not want that.\n\n291\n00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:16.348\nWe wanna create a separate VLAN,\nand I'm gonna just do 1999 here.\n\n292\n00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:20.120\nAnd we are going to give it a name,\nand this time,\n\n293\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.623\nwe are going to call\njust a null VLAN instead.\n\n294\n00:17:23.623 --> 00:17:25.249\nExit out of that and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n295\n00:17:25.249 --> 00:17:29.133\nSo now, that I've got this null VLAN,\n\n296\n00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:34.309\nwhat I want to do is I want to\nmove all of the posts off of\n\n297\n00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:39.273\nthe default VLAN here\nInto that VLAN 999 here.\n\n298\n00:17:39.273 --> 00:17:40.632\nThat is what we want to do.\n\n299\n00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:44.751\nSo if I had to do that, doing it four\ntimes in a row, just like it should,\n\n300\n00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:46.357\nit is repetitive as crazy.\n\n301\n00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:51.637\nI don't wanna do that for the other 19\nports that are also on here either.\n\n302\n00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:55.434\nThat's sounds insane or\nactually 24 that are on here, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:56.979\nSo I don't want to do that either.\n\n304\n00:17:56.979 --> 00:17:59.909\nBut what you can do is you\ncan use a range command.\n\n305\n00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:03.423\nYou have to actually set\nlike contiguous range is up.\n\n306\n00:18:03.423 --> 00:18:10.491\nSo you want to look, for\nexample right 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\n307\n00:18:10.491 --> 00:18:13.071\nThat's perfectly fine, but\nI can't just do all of them one time and\n\n308\n00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:13.897\nset a range command.\n\n309\n00:18:13.897 --> 00:18:18.471\nBut it says, there's something missing\nin this range, and won't go any further.\n\n310\n00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:23.170\nSo let's do it for\nthe injustice first 10 for\n\n311\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:28.351\nright now as good example so\nthe way that we do this if\n\n312\n00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:33.893\nyou want to ask you set the same\nexact configuration for\n\n313\n00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:39.556\nall time as I do interface range and\nthen fast Ethernet,\n\n314\n00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:45.128\n1/0/3, and\nthen you have to do this weird thing.\n\n315\n00:18:45.128 --> 00:18:48.491\nThere has to be a space, dash, space.\n\n316\n00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:51.702\nNow, I kid you not, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:55.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do not say the space don't matter.\n\n318\n00:18:55.614 --> 00:18:59.864\nThey absolutely do matter here so\nfor us is gonna be -10,\n\n319\n00:18:59.864 --> 00:19:02.585\nand then, we're gonna press Enter.\n\n320\n00:19:02.585 --> 00:19:08.197\nNotice the prompt change here\nwhich is config-IF-range.\n\n321\n00:19:08.197 --> 00:19:12.820\nThat is how you know that you've\ngot the range command set up.\n\n322\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.803\nIf you type this in, and it doesn't\ngive you the range at the end and\n\n323\n00:19:15.803 --> 00:19:19.076\nthe prompt doesn't change,\nyou did not successfully configure this.\n\n324\n00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:23.193\nSo I want to do two, actually we're\ngonna do three things here okay.\n\n325\n00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:26.186\nI don't want anybody just\nbeing on the plugin and\n\n326\n00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:29.327\ngetting access to anyone\nof these ports here okay.\n\n327\n00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:32.624\nSo I also want to make sure\nthat this ports don't try and\n\n328\n00:19:32.624 --> 00:19:36.505\ndo that dynamic trunking that\nDaniel was talking about as well.\n\n329\n00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:37.960\nSo there's a couple of things.\n\n330\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.606\nI wanna do a switch port mode access.\n\n331\n00:19:41.606 --> 00:19:46.657\nThat hard sets what every single port\nto an access port which is fine.\n\n332\n00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:52.689\nThen, I want to re-assign them from\ndefault 1 into my null VLAN so\n\n333\n00:19:52.689 --> 00:19:59.757\nI just do switch port,\nAnd access VLAN 999,\n\n334\n00:19:59.757 --> 00:20:05.187\nand now, that moves them all into that\nparking lot VLAN where I want them.\n\n335\n00:20:05.187 --> 00:20:08.324\nNot everybody's gonna know\nthat your default VLAN or\n\n336\n00:20:08.324 --> 00:20:12.652\nwhere all of your ports are that are not\nbeing used is gonna be in VLAN 99.\n\n337\n00:20:12.652 --> 00:20:14.882\nYou can make it 78 or-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n338\n00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:17.252\n&gt;&gt; 33 if you want to,\nI don't care which one you do,\n\n339\n00:20:17.252 --> 00:20:18.863\nit doesn't care once you do that.\n\n340\n00:20:18.863 --> 00:20:23.303\nBut then the other thing\nI like doing is actually\n\n341\n00:20:23.303 --> 00:20:27.636\nissuing not a node shutdown,\nbut a shutdown.\n\n342\n00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:32.336\nOnce I issue that shutdown, it means these\nports that are on by default are also\n\n343\n00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:34.772\ngonna turn them off administratively.\n\n344\n00:20:34.772 --> 00:20:37.692\nSo even if Daniel walks up to a port and\ngoes hey,\n\n345\n00:20:37.692 --> 00:20:42.510\nall these blank ports that are in here,\nWatch what happens when I plug this is.\n\n346\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.857\nHe plugs in\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.\n\n347\n00:20:43.857 --> 00:20:44.563\n&gt;&gt; Lights don't don't come on.\n\n348\n00:20:44.563 --> 00:20:45.093\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n349\n00:20:45.093 --> 00:20:45.855\n&gt;&gt; Nothing and I don't like that.\n\n350\n00:20:45.855 --> 00:20:49.411\nSo one of the attacks that you have to\nworry about is what we call the VLAN\n\n351\n00:20:49.411 --> 00:20:49.965\nhopping.\n\n352\n00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:52.943\nVLAN hopping normally wants\nto dump you out into VLAN 1.\n\n353\n00:20:52.943 --> 00:20:55.752\nThat's where it wants to dump\nyou cuz it assumes that nobody\n\n354\n00:20:55.752 --> 00:20:57.953\nmoves these things out of that port so\nwhy not.\n\n355\n00:20:57.953 --> 00:21:00.268\nBut now if you get in to VLAN 1.\n\n356\n00:21:00.268 --> 00:21:02.387\nWhat do you get access to?\n\n357\n00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:05.723\nDo show VLAN brief.\n\n358\n00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:09.644\nAll right so,\nDaniel if you end up dumped into VLAN 1,\n\n359\n00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.746\nyou get access to this ports right here.\n\n360\n00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:12.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n361\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.026\n&gt;&gt; Flawless.\n\n362\n00:21:13.026 --> 00:21:17.583\nBut if I continue to move the rest of\nthis ports all the way over there, and\n\n363\n00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:22.174\nthere were no ports left in that default\nVLAN well that means you plug in.\n\n364\n00:21:22.174 --> 00:21:25.630\nYou try and do a VLAN hopping, and\nyou get to the default VLAN1, and\n\n365\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.972\nthere's nothing there.\n\n366\n00:21:26.972 --> 00:21:27.701\nThere's nothing there.\n\n367\n00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:29.315\n&gt;&gt; A lot of good that did me, right?\n\n368\n00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:30.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of good that did you.\n\n369\n00:21:30.235 --> 00:21:30.940\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose, right?\n\n370\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:37.112\nYeah so hackers will figure out a default\nsystem that wasn't setup the best.\n\n371\n00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:41.942\nBut if we do our due diligence, understand\nhow VLAN should be setup and the Design\n\n372\n00:21:41.942 --> 00:21:46.788\nbehind them that is proper, we can\nbasically decimate that attack altogether.\n\n373\n00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:48.613\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just for\nthe sake of time Daniel,\n\n374\n00:21:48.613 --> 00:21:51.318\nI'm not gonna do the rest of\nthese moving out of VLAN 1 to 99.\n\n375\n00:21:51.318 --> 00:21:51.946\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we get the idea.\n\n376\n00:21:51.946 --> 00:21:54.790\n&gt;&gt; But you get the idea of\nwhat's going on here, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.410\nSo practice this on your own as you\ngo through here and do this as well.\n\n378\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:03.570\nNow, somebody always asks the question,\ncan we just turn the VLAN off?\n\n379\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.840\nIsn't that something that we can try and\ndo?\n\n380\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.010\nWell, let's see, okay.\n\n381\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.683\nSo let me do an exit here and\nlet's do VLAN 1, and\n\n382\n00:22:10.683 --> 00:22:12.588\nlet's just try what we know here.\n\n383\n00:22:12.588 --> 00:22:16.025\nLet's just type in, Shutdown.\n\n384\n00:22:19.198 --> 00:22:24.135\nOkay, notice that look at what\nit says command is only allowed\n\n385\n00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.148\non VLANs 2 through-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:22:26.148 --> 00:22:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 1,001.\n\n387\n00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.580\n&gt;&gt; So.\n&gt;&gt; So you can't even turn this one off.\n\n388\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n389\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.460\n&gt;&gt; So it's gonna be on so I can't do that.\n\n390\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.190\nWell, what if we try and\nactually like remove it.\n\n391\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.770\nHow about that?\n\n392\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.680\nThat's a good idea if\nI'm not gonna use it.\n\n393\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.070\nIf I know I'm not gonna use, no.\n\n394\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.080\n&gt;&gt; Delete that sucker.\n\n395\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.490\n&gt;&gt; VLAN 1, let's try it.\n\n396\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Man, look at that.\n\n397\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.117\n&gt;&gt; You got this thing on lockdown.\n\n398\n00:22:45.117 --> 00:22:47.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just the way it is.\n\n399\n00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.960\nSo this is your best way of protecting.\n\n400\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.490\nSo that's shutdown and\nmaybe a little bit too extreme for you but\n\n401\n00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.925\nI like it cuz this means that If somebody\nneeds to put something on my switch-\n\n402\n00:22:56.925 --> 00:22:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n403\n00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.650\n&gt;&gt; They can plug it in and\nthen go hey, it's not working.\n\n404\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.215\nWell, that means they have to come and\nrequest from me, and go hey,\n\n405\n00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.209\nI need this port working.\n\n406\n00:23:04.209 --> 00:23:05.823\nWell, then, I can go in and\n\n407\n00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:09.415\nI can assign that port to the correct\nVLAN that it needs to go.\n\n408\n00:23:09.415 --> 00:23:14.800\nThen, I can administratively turn\nit back on and now I know, okay?\n\n409\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.220\nSo I have that ability to do\nsomething like this if we need to.\n\n410\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.920\nOkay?\n\n411\n00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.220\nAll right Daniel.\nWe have just a few minutes left but\n\n412\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.730\nit's time to break the rules.\n\n413\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n414\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.830\n&gt;&gt; I like the rule breaking.\n\n415\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's what I.\n\n416\n00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWhy not?\n\n417\n00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.640\n&gt;&gt; I do what I do.\n\n418\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.100\nAll right?\nCuz I wanna break the rules.\n\n419\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.810\n&gt;&gt; So now, remember I said that there's\nonly really what we're supposed to have\n\n420\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.670\nlike, one port per VLAN.\n\n421\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.520\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n422\n00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.240\nso you need one port that we've\nactually assigned to VLAN.\n\n423\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.600\nI can't assign two VLANs to it.\n\n424\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Either way, you can't say I got one\nport that's in more than one VLAN.\n\n425\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.724\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is always a good\nrole until it doesn't work anymore.\n\n426\n00:23:47.724 --> 00:23:49.452\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Until it's not a good role, right?\n\n427\n00:23:49.452 --> 00:23:50.916\n&gt;&gt; Until it's not a good role.\n\n428\n00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:52.982\nAnd the way that we do this.\n\n429\n00:23:52.982 --> 00:23:56.968\nIs that today, in the networking\nworld that you and I are on.\n\n430\n00:23:56.968 --> 00:24:00.700\nMore than likely we'll not only be\nconfiguring data VLANs like what we\n\n431\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.700\nhave here.\n\n432\n00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.520\nBut we'll also end up configuring\nwhat we call voice VLANs as well,\n\n433\n00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.610\nand that is a part of the exam objective\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n434\n00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:15.200\nSo what we want to do is we wanna show you\nhow you can actually take a single port\n\n435\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.990\nand add in two different\nVLANs to that port as well.\n\n436\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:24.470\nNow, they're not really different types of\nVLANs, but the configuration is different,\n\n437\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.380\nwhich means that the port sees them as\nbeing different, not being the same VLAN.\n\n438\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.150\nI know it's weird, but\n\n439\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.920\nit really is, however they've actually\ndone that, that's what happens here.\n\n440\n00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.860\nSo we're gonna move over to NYCORE2,\nand the reason why,\n\n441\n00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:43.110\nNYCORE2 is also attached to a Cisco IP\nphone somewhere at some particular point.\n\n442\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.360\nI think it's on port 12,\nit's also attached there as well.\n\n443\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.690\nSo we have NYCORE 2 and let's go ahead and\nconfigure a couple of Vlans.\n\n444\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.413\nWe're gonna configure one as data and\none as voice here, and\n\n445\n00:24:55.413 --> 00:24:57.751\nwe're gonna use VLANs 50 and 60.\n\n446\n00:24:57.751 --> 00:25:02.630\nSo on NYCORE 2,\nI go into my global configuration mode, so\n\n447\n00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:09.610\nI did from user mode to privilege mode and\nthen to global configuration mode.\n\n448\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.818\nThen I create VLAN 50 and\n\n449\n00:25:13.818 --> 00:25:17.470\nwe give it a name and\nwe will call this one, voice,\n\n450\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.480\nI have to do exit out here and\nthen I'm gonna do a VLAN 60.\n\n451\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.000\nAnd we will also put this one as a name\nand we will call this one data, just for\n\n452\n00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.570\nthe sake of differentiating them.\n\n453\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.790\nData VLANs are what you and\n\n454\n00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.740\nI have been configuring over the past\ncouple of episodes as we've done just now.\n\n455\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.660\nBut now, we are going to configure\na voice VLAN and a data VLAN and\n\n456\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.520\nput a single port in both.\n\n457\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.820\nThe way that this ends up working\nin reality is that Daniel\n\n458\n00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.685\nessentially sets it up the way\nthat we're about to show you.\n\n459\n00:25:50.685 --> 00:25:55.880\nHe brings a workstation out,\nbut it's weird if he has\n\n460\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:03.167\na Cisco IP phone to plug that into the\nwire into the phone from the wall jack.\n\n461\n00:26:03.167 --> 00:26:07.113\nHe then takes a smaller length of cord,\nlet's say 6 feet or so.\n\n462\n00:26:07.113 --> 00:26:12.813\nAnd on the back of that Cisco phone\nthere's a single port switch that\n\n463\n00:26:12.813 --> 00:26:17.920\nnow he takes and runs from that\nport down to the work station.\n\n464\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.209\nAnd so this essentially\nallows the workstation and\n\n465\n00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:26.899\nthe phone to operate on one cable and\n\n466\n00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:33.290\nit creates two different VLANs\ngoing over that one port.\n\n467\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.620\nSo you can actually violate the rules\nin that sense but you can't create\n\n468\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:43.515\ntwo data VLANs on one port, but you can\ncreate a voice VLAN and a data VLAN.\n\n469\n00:26:43.515 --> 00:26:44.903\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So much break in the rules as we\n\n470\n00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:45.741\nare bending them.\n\n471\n00:26:45.741 --> 00:26:49.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're bending them [INAUDIBLE]\nit's on the verge of breaking,\n\n472\n00:26:49.605 --> 00:26:51.120\nyou are hearing cracking.\n\n473\n00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.244\n&gt;&gt; You are hearing stress fractions.\n\n474\n00:26:52.244 --> 00:26:56.452\n&gt;&gt; So now we've created our VLANs here,\n\n475\n00:26:56.452 --> 00:27:00.529\nlet's verify we've created them,\n\n476\n00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:05.970\ndo show VLAN brief,\nin a moment, there we go!\n\n477\n00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.280\nSo you see a voice VLAN,\n\n478\n00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.640\nit doesn't look like it actually\ntook my data VLAN, so there we go.\n\n479\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.930\nSo that's why we always verify,\nVLAN 60 and then name\n\n480\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:24.211\ndata, try it again,\nDo Show vlan brief here.\n\n481\n00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.540\nOkay, there we go, so\nfinally it actually did end up happening,\n\n482\n00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.930\nI don't have anything assigned to this.\n\n483\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.950\nWhen we start to do this,\nthis is gonna be weird, but\n\n484\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.560\nwhat you want to do is you want to\nassign it to the data VLAN first.\n\n485\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.329\nSo we're gonna take that\nport which is fa1/0/12 cuz\n\n486\n00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:48.211\nthat's the one that's connected\nto a Cisco IP phone here.\n\n487\n00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:51.739\nNow let me get back out,\n\n488\n00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:56.680\ninterface fa1/0/12, and\n\n489\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:02.270\nnow we do a switchPort mode access.\n\n490\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.530\nNow, most of us would go,\nwait a minute, if it's two VLANs,\n\n491\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.290\nshouldn't I assign this\nas being a Trunk port?\n\n492\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.980\nNo, you don't cuz you're actually\nallowing for something else tol happen,\n\n493\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:19.020\nyou're saying that this is an access from\nthe data VLAN, that's what you're doing.\n\n494\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:25.390\nSo this one is gonna be that and\nthen we'll do a switch port access,\n\n495\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:32.240\nVLAN 60 is what this one will be, so\nwe assign it to our data VLAN first.\n\n496\n00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.050\nAfter that point,\nonce I get that one assigned,\n\n497\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.990\nthis is where it gets a little\nbit more unusual, okay?\n\n498\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:43.504\nSo let's now just do a switch port and a\nquestion mark, and now I notice that there\n\n499\n00:28:43.504 --> 00:28:49.166\nis a lot more other options for\nyou beside just access and trunk now.\n\n500\n00:28:49.166 --> 00:28:52.630\nAnd it is weird because we did this\nbefore, where we did the modes and\n\n501\n00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.360\nwe showed you that.\n\n502\n00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.840\nBut we also did switchPort\nwhere you saw a few of them but\n\n503\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.930\nnow notice that I just do switchPort,\nand I didn't even get to the mode.\n\n504\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.170\nAnd there is access,\nthere is autostate, you name it,\n\n505\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.800\nthere is tons of different things here for\nus.\n\n506\n00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.000\nWe're looking for this one, which is\nvoice, which actually has voice appliance\n\n507\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.546\nattributes, so this allows for\nvoice appliance attributes.\n\n508\n00:29:13.546 --> 00:29:22.273\nSo switchPort voice, And\nnow let's take a look,\n\n509\n00:29:22.273 --> 00:29:27.150\nnotice it can detect it, look,\nthat's the option I want, which is VLAN.\n\n510\n00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.600\nswitchPort Voice vlan, and\n\n511\n00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.060\nthis one is supposed to be VLAN 50.\n\n512\n00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:39.780\nSo now that it's actually\ninside of VLAN 50,\n\n513\n00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.780\nonce we get this setup, this is where\neverything else works just by default.\n\n514\n00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.304\nIf all of your Cisco IP stuff is set up,\nnow it's not,\n\n515\n00:29:47.304 --> 00:29:51.310\nyou got a bit more configuration to go,\nwe're not doing that in this show.\n\n516\n00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.740\nBut overall though, if you start\ndoing this, like if your phone and\n\n517\n00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.040\neverything else.\n\n518\n00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.880\nLike you didn't put like\neverything on there yet,\n\n519\n00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.960\nnow I can get a configuration file\nfrom an FTP server somewhere.\n\n520\n00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.439\nIt can do everything, it just starts\nloading up, it starts updating,\n\n521\n00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:07.640\nit starts doing everything that needs to.\n\n522\n00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.570\nThen your workstation will again work and\nconfigure beyond the regular network\n\n523\n00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:16.321\nthat you will put everything else on and\nyou are off and ready to go.\n\n524\n00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:22.165\nLet's do a do show interface fa1/0/12 and\n\n525\n00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:28.490\nthen we're gonna add in another command\nhere at the end called switchPort.\n\n526\n00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.590\nAnd what we're trying to do is, we are\ntrying to verify a couple of things here.\n\n527\n00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.890\nOne of course, is that we have\nboth of them actually assigned,\n\n528\n00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.940\nso notice here is the voice and\nthen, there it is, access mode.\n\n529\n00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.900\nSo that is the information you're\nlooking for as the top and\n\n530\n00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.900\nthe bottom option that you see there.\n\n531\n00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.560\nAs long as both of them are assigned\nyou have now actually gone ahead and\n\n532\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.068\ndone that where two, oops!\n\n533\n00:30:53.068 --> 00:30:56.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] This is awesome,\n\n534\n00:30:56.432 --> 00:31:02.467\nmakes you feel like you are really\nin control of your lab here.\n\n535\n00:31:02.467 --> 00:31:04.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n536\n00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:09.330\nwhat does do show vlan\nbrief look right now?\n\n537\n00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.579\nNow notice this is something strange too,\n\n538\n00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:16.769\nthat you're starting to see here which\nyou don't expect to see normally, okay?\n\n539\n00:31:16.769 --> 00:31:21.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n540\n00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.640\n&gt;&gt; But notice one is a voice VLAN and one\nis a data VLAN, and it's the same port.\n\n541\n00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.000\nSo yes, we did break the rules or\nbend them in the way that Daniel said,\n\n542\n00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.120\naround the corner,\naround a 90 degree angle.\n\n543\n00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:32.815\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n544\n00:31:32.815 --> 00:31:38.040\n&gt;&gt; We did bend it really hard and just\ncontinue to bend her, but you do see this.\n\n545\n00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.660\nNow I'm showing you this output\nalso on purpose too because\n\n546\n00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.180\nthis is something that\nyou may end up seeing.\n\n547\n00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.950\nAnd you might not at some point here,\nget a lot\n\n548\n00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:53.400\nmore information that's gonna say, how\nis this possible, what's going on here?\n\n549\n00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.370\nWell just remember,\nas long as this is voice and\n\n550\n00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.660\ndata VLAN, perfectly fine,\ntwo data VLANs, not perfectly fine.\n\n551\n00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.250\nCuz you shouldn't see where one says,\nsales, and\n\n552\n00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.190\nthen marketing, and\nthen two ports being that way.\n\n553\n00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.920\nBut voice or something like that,\nand they'll try and give you a hint,\n\n554\n00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.950\nit might say, phone system or something.\n\n555\n00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you get the idea,\n\n556\n00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.620\nas long as they're represented there.\n\n557\n00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.350\nAll right, Daniel, so\nthat ends our initial configuration in\n\n558\n00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.060\ntaking a look at the idea\nof VLAN configuration.\n\n559\n00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.130\nBut we haven't actually even dealt with,\nwell what happens with multiple switches?\n\n560\n00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:30.030\nAnd we now start creating VLANs on 1, how\ndo we get it on the other ones as well?\n\n561\n00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.375\nAnd we'll be doing that in\nanother lab in the near future.\n\n562\n00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, sounds like a lot of fun,\ncan't wait to be a part of that,\n\n563\n00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.540\nbut looking at our clock for\nthis episode, we have exhausted the time.\n\n564\n00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It goes so fast, so fleeting, Ronnie,\n\n565\n00:32:40.713 --> 00:32:43.886\nthanks so much for joining us today,\nwe always appreciate you dropping by.\n\n566\n00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:47.561\nAnd as always, we appreciate you dropping\nby as well, but we've gotta call it a day.\n\n567\n00:32:47.561 --> 00:32:50.951\nThanks for joining us, everyone, signing\noff for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n568\n00:32:50.951 --> 00:32:51.680\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n569\n00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.600\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n570\n00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.984\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n571\n00:32:54.984 --> 00:33:00.906\n[MUSIC]\n\n572\n00:33:00.906 --> 00:33:03.250\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

The team also shows how to make the switches work together by configuring trunks which allow for multiple vlans to flow over them.  They describe the use of vlan tagging 802.1q for allow trunks to keep the data tagged to a vlan. Lastly, the discuss the Native VLAN, this is the vlan in which the traffic is untagged and normally used for management and not port assignments",

great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.360\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode you'll be excited because we're\n\n7\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.973\nback with more in our CCENT Series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:25.936\nJoining us back in the studio again our\ngood friend and one Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:26.840\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n10\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.530\nHow is it going today?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.630\nThank you for having me here.\n&gt;&gt; A pleasure.\n\n12\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.550\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel,\n\n13\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.360\nas we get started here\nwe are in the middle\n\n14\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.800\nof taking a look of course on\nour journey through CCENT and\n\n15\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.070\nunderstanding all the topics that\nare gonna be asked about on the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.270\nWe are now taking a look at,\nwell, more VLANs, right?\n\n17\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.540\nSo in a previous episode,\n\n18\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.960\nif you've been watching these series on\nthe order that their on our website there.\n\n19\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.850\nYou've seen us configure of\ncourse a VLAN on one switch.\n\n20\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.450\nWell now, we're gonna add in\na second switch into that mix and\n\n21\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.520\nwhat does that actually mean\nwhen we start to do that?\n\n22\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.090\nWell, if we kinda review some of the\nthings that we had talked about, right,\n\n23\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.950\non a single switch it allows\nus to take that one switch and\n\n24\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.570\nessentially chop it up into\nmultiple smaller switches.\n\n25\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.420\nWe can treat them that way.\n\n26\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.890\nAnd we don't really want to\nphysically damage the switch.\n\n27\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.780\nBut we can actually allow them\nto become individual switches.\n\n28\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.650\nBut then when it comes across\nmultiple switches though,\n\n29\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.720\nit allows us to take that single VLAN and\nspan it across, well, multiple switches.\n\n30\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.360\nSo this means regardless of where they\nreside, if I need that broadcast domain to\n\n31\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.510\ngo across two, three,\neven hundreds of switches.\n\n32\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.250\nI can do that as well.\n\n33\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.940\nSo that's why we're talking about this.\n\n34\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.500\nAnd so today, we're gonna show you,\n\n35\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.200\nof course then, how to make sure that\nwe configure it to do that as well and\n\n36\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.560\nwe also have to implement,\nof course, trunking technology.\n\n37\n00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.140\nSo the great thing is, you already\nunderstand how to create VLans and\n\n38\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.420\nnow we're gonna implement trunking\ntechnology also to help us out as well.\n\n39\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.190\nAnd then, in the way that our lab is set\nup for practice-labs.com, we're also going\n\n40\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.910\nto talk about, well, another particular\nprotocol that's a really good protocol.\n\n41\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.660\nBut you don't see it used too often today.\n\n42\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.320\nAnd just when I said that,\nat one point on the Cisco exams,\n\n43\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.590\nthey had actually removed this topic\nfrom all of the actual CCENT and\n\n44\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.090\nCCNA setting and\nthen they brought it back.\n\n45\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.640\nSo now in this iteration,\nit's been brought back.\n\n46\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.790\nSo we're gonna see a little bit of that\nbut we'll get more of that inside the CCNA\n\n47\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.950\nrouting and switching show,\nwhen we get to that.\n\n48\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.080\nBut they did bring it back in to\nshow you the technology and so\n\n49\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.460\nwe'll also be doing that in our lab.\n\n50\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.260\nAnd we'll do a brief explanation but\n\n51\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.840\nwe'll cover it much more in depth when we\nget to the CCNA routing and switch, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.200\nSo that's what we'll end up seeing here,\nokay?\n\n53\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.910\nSo, let's take a look at my machine.\n\n54\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.600\nAnd I went ahead and brought up\nthe lab that we're going to be using.\n\n55\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.390\nIf I click on that hamburger\nbutton right there.\n\n56\n00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.130\nIf you go in and you have the lab,\nthe one we are doing is the configure\n\n57\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.200\nverify troubleshoot\ninterswitch connectivity and\n\n58\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.670\nthat of course will lead you to lab set\nwhich you can fall along by hitting next\n\n59\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.950\nas you go down through the lab diagram and\nyou can do that.\n\n60\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.460\nYou can see that we're\ngonna be connecting to,\n\n61\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.090\nwe want multiple devices\nhere to help us out.\n\n62\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.270\nSo at this point, that's what you'll\nend up seeing, as we do that, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.370\nBut really,\nthe overall goal at this point, right,\n\n64\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.390\nis we're gonna create trunk links and\n\n65\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.030\nwe're gonna use something that we call\nDTP, which is dynamic trunking protocol.\n\n66\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.890\nNow, when we get to this point and\nwe show how it works,\n\n67\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.570\nI do need to tell you about dynamic\ntrunking protocol a little bit.\n\n68\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.630\nAnd then BTP of course and then we'll also\napply the idea when we apply trunk links.\n\n69\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.240\nThe idea of what we call 802.1q VLAN\ntagging, in Cisco land, they still call it\n\n70\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.460\nencapsulation, even though, technically,\nit is what's called VLAN tagging anymore.\n\n71\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.460\nAnd then, of course, we'll know also talk\nabout this idea, the native VLAN and\n\n72\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.090\nwhy it's important to us when it\ngoes to multiple switches, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390\nSo, that is our goal for\nour labs as we continue.\n\n74\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.580\nSo let's start right here at NYCORE1.\n\n75\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.550\nThis is a switch that we have\ncreated VLANs on before.\n\n76\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.070\nWe have wiped it clean and\nwe are starting all over here.\n\n77\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.260\nSo this way, we will go ahead and do this.\n\n78\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260\nWe're gonna create two VLANs on NYCORE1.\n\n79\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.240\nThis time, we are going to rename them.\n\n80\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.900\nOne is going to be named management and\nthe other is going to be named sales here.\n\n81\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.558\nAnd we will use VLANs 10 and 20.\n\n82\n00:04:16.558 --> 00:04:20.810\nSo on NYCORE1, let me go ahead and\nget access into this thing.\n\n83\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.520\nI need to get into my\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n84\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.670\nSo that brings me into Privileged EXEC and\nthen configure,\n\n85\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.080\nif I can actually type correctly.\n\n86\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.205\nTerminal, now that I am actually in\nthe global configuration mode I can do\n\n87\n00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:40.030\nVLan10 and notice,\nI'm now in the VLAN configuration mode.\n\n88\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.350\nThen I can do name and this one,\nwe're going to call it management.\n\n89\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.660\nThen on this switch, I know cuz I've\ndone this before, you have to hit exit.\n\n90\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.360\nMake sure you get back up\nto global config mode.\n\n91\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.830\nThen you can do VLAN 20, name.\n\n92\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.820\nAnd then, this one is gonna be sales.\n\n93\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.210\nAll right, now, just because I've seen\nthat happen before and I don't know.\n\n94\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.210\nWe're supposed to be able to assume\nthat we've created these VLANs and\n\n95\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.160\nthat everything should be right and\nwe don't have\n\n96\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.420\nto worry about verifying too often but\non this switch, I've seen it happen.\n\n97\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.850\nSo, let me go ahead and\ntype in a do show VLAN brief.\n\n98\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.370\nSo remember that keyword do?\n\n99\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.570\nYou have to actually be able\nto type out the whole thing.\n\n100\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.660\nCuz if you don't,\nit's not gonna accept it.\n\n101\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.110\nSo you can't do abbreviations in there.\n\n102\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.820\nBut normally, what I would have to\ndo is go all the way back out to\n\n103\n00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.720\nprivileged EXEC mode,\nthen I can type it in.\n\n104\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.920\nAnd Daniel, look at that.\n\n105\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.120\nSo even though I exit it out and\nI told it to create VLAN 20-\n\n106\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.900\n&gt;&gt; You can see it.\n\n107\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.050\n&gt;&gt; You can see it right up here.\n\n108\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.090\nThis switch, there's something\na little bit funny about this switch.\n\n109\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.930\nIt just didn't like it, so even though\nI exited out, I can't tell you why.\n\n110\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.700\nSo it might be something actually\nspecific just with this one switch\n\n111\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.590\nin their lab environment.\n\n112\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.440\nSo let's try it again and\n\n113\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.810\nthat's why I like to verify this before I\nassume that something else is going on.\n\n114\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.120\nSo let's try to get VLan 20.\n\n115\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.450\nSo I tell you that I did\nsomething different but\n\n116\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.200\nwe're doing the same thing here.\n\n117\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.590\nThen name and this time Sales.\n\n118\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.710\nAnd now, let's do it again,\ndo show VLAN brief.\n\n119\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.840\nAnd now it shows up, so, I don't know why\nI have to type in the second one twice.\n\n120\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.940\nI hope it means if I do a third one,\nI have to do it three times.\n\n121\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.180\nBut yeah, that could be something\njust specific to this switch.\n\n122\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.390\nSo don't automatically assume\nthat you'll have to do it but\n\n123\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.810\nthe best way of course is to verify that\nyou have your VLAN created is to always\n\n124\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.360\nenter that end, that do show vlan brief.\n\n125\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.309\nOr if you're in the privilege exec mode,\nshow vlan brief and then you're off and\n\n126\n00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:40.310\nready to go, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.289\nNow, once we do this, okay and\n\n128\n00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.750\nnow I'm ready to connect\nto my second switch, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.318\nNow, NYCORE1 is the switch that I have.\n\n130\n00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:51.911\nThe other switch that I\nwant to connect to to,\n\n131\n00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:57.505\nbe able to span VLANs across is\ngonna be one called NYACCESS1, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:02.060\nNYACCESS1 and\nthere is a particular interface over here.\n\n133\n00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.410\nSo if I go to NYACCESS1, there we go.\n\n134\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.030\nLet me switch that and\nthen we'll scroll this down, so\n\n135\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.300\nwe can see that switch there.\n\n136\n00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.960\nAll right, so from here,\nwe are going to configure\n\n137\n00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.150\nalso the, actually on this one, this\nis the other side we're connecting to.\n\n138\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.640\nI'm gonna be configuring on NYCORE1,\n\n139\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.980\nI need to configure\na trunk link to this one.\n\n140\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.490\nI just misread where I had\ntyped in my notes correctly.\n\n141\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:36.557\nSo on NYCORE1, I'm gonna create\nthat trunk link over to NYACCESS1.\n\n142\n00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:43.096\nLet me get back out of\nthe VLAN config mode.\n\n143\n00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:48.073\nAnd once I'm in here,\nI want to go into the interface fa,\n\n144\n00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:52.846\nfor fast ethernet, 1/0/22,\nso that is the port\n\n145\n00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:57.920\nthat is connected to NYACCESS1 So\n\n146\n00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.492\nnow that I'm in the configuration\ninterface at this point,\n\n147\n00:08:01.492 --> 00:08:04.690\nI need to configure this as a Trunkcoin,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.980\nNow I'm gonna do it kind of\nin a weird way first, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.520\nSo if you're saying,\nRonnie just try everything else.\n\n150\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.040\nNo, I'm doing this on purpose.\n\n151\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.410\nSo I don't want to fault me for that.\n\n152\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.280\nRemember how when we created access\nports in our previous lab, right?\n\n153\n00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.600\nWe did switch, port, mode, access, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.170\nAnd then once we did that,\nit just kind of gave as the next line and\n\n155\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.960\nwe configured it for switch port access\nVLAN 20 or 30 or whatever it might be.\n\n156\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.080\nOkay, that's fine, but\n\n157\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.740\non this particular switch there's a couple\nof things that you may end up seeing.\n\n158\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.670\nSo let's do the same thing.\n\n159\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.720\nSo let's say switch port mode.\n\n160\n00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.040\nAnd this time, I already told you\nI want to create this as a trunk.\n\n161\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.780\nSo you know what the next\nword is supposed to be.\n\n162\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.376\nBut let's see what happens here.\n\n163\n00:08:49.376 --> 00:08:50.823\nSwitch port.\n\n164\n00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.250\nSwitch port.\n\n165\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.157\nOkay, mode.\n\n166\n00:08:57.157 --> 00:08:59.660\nTrunk.\n\n167\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.060\nAnd now we actually do have where,\n\n168\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.130\nlet me see if I can space\nthat up a bit here, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.760\nWhere it tells us this\nkind of unusual thing.\n\n170\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.030\nNow, Daniel, it doesn't say that\nthere's an error in the syntax.\n\n171\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.130\n&gt;&gt; No, it does not.\n\n172\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.040\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of weird.\n\n173\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.220\n&gt;&gt; An interface whose trunk\n\n174\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.390\nencapsulation is auto cannot\nbe configured to trunk mode.\n\n175\n00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.730\nOkay, so it's saying that yeah,\nwhat you typed is right,\n\n176\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.485\nbut you can't do that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n177\n00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:26.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:28.097\n&gt;&gt; So the first thing that caught my eye\n\n179\n00:09:28.097 --> 00:09:29.300\nwas command rejected.\n\n180\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.330\nI'm like, wait a minute,\nwhy would it reject a command?\n\n181\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.690\nAnd then it explains to you why.\n\n182\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.010\nSo Daniel just explained the why part.\n\n183\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.800\nSo Daniel, when we go back,\n\n184\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.970\nagain, I'm asking to rely on your\nmemory now, and on Daniel's memory.\n\n185\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.740\nRemember that when I said that\nevery single port on the switch,\n\n186\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.320\nwhen you first turn it on?\n\n187\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.160\nIt desires, normally,\nto become a trunk, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.480\nIt desires to become a trunk.\n\n189\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.146\nSo what ends up happening here is just\nlike what we saw where I said that also\n\n190\n00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:05.140\nlike on duplex and speed, there's\na configuration that can be evil at times.\n\n191\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.040\nWell the idea of auto is one of\nthose things that can happen.\n\n192\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.514\nSo right now what they're saying,\nright, in this switchboard mode, and\n\n193\n00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:18.490\nthey're saying it said that now,\nthat you have to actually enable\n\n194\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.200\nthe encapsulation first is\nwhat they're telling us.\n\n195\n00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.630\nBut the problem is,\nby default it is set to automatic, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.260\nSo it's saying hey, I'm gonna actually\ndefault to whatever the other side says.\n\n197\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.800\nBut the other side isn't\nsaying anything right now.\n\n198\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.760\nSo it's not doing anything and\nI can't make this do this right?\n\n199\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.340\nDo a switch port mode trunk okay?\n\n200\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.850\nNow why is that?\n\n201\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.920\nWell if I do switch port mode\ntrunk remember what we're saying.\n\n202\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.210\nDon't do anything automatic, right?\n\n203\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.980\nWe are now hard setting this\nsaying it must be a trunk.\n\n204\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.610\nWell then,\nwe can't set the encapsulation automatic.\n\n205\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.470\nSo if you set it hard set in one way,\nyou have to do the hard set for\n\n206\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.560\neverything else in that interface.\n\n207\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.970\nHopefully that makes sense, right?\n\n208\n00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.020\nYou can't do a mix of auto\non one configuration and\n\n209\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.530\nthen a hard set on the other one, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.050\nSo the next thing we have to do\nhere is actually go, alright.\n\n211\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.580\nLet's do this here.\n\n212\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.770\nWe'll go to switch port and\n\n213\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.860\nthen trunk and now lets do a question\nmark and we'll press Enter.\n\n214\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.100\nAnd here you will see that there are\nseveral different things that we can do.\n\n215\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.000\nOne of course, is the idea of allow, and\nthen there is gonna be more after that.\n\n216\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.260\nThen there's encapsulation.\n\n217\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.370\nThat's the alt error are air\nis pointing us to or\n\n218\n00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.650\nthe rejection command that we're getting.\n\n219\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.010\nThe command rejected is telling\nis the encapsulation, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.980\nIs actually, needs to be set here.\n\n221\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.010\nAnd there in those also setting\nwhat we call the native VLAN,\n\n222\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.810\nwhich we'll get to a little bit later.\n\n223\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.190\nAnd then there's also pruning as well,\nokay?\n\n224\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.400\nPruning is actually a very important\npart of doing something like\n\n225\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.850\nconfiguring multiple VLANs and\nespecially when you're using VTP.\n\n226\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:10.790\nThere's really not a reason for you to use\nVTP except for this aspect of pruning.\n\n227\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.416\nCuz it allows you to if you end\nup have VLANs on 1 switch, or\n\n228\n00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:16.460\nlet's say 15 switches.\n\n229\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.370\nBut let's say they're on a 150.\n\n230\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.022\nIt says well let's not send information\nto those switches that the VLAN's aren't\n\n231\n00:12:23.022 --> 00:12:23.940\neven on.\n\n232\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.120\nIt seems to be insane.\n\n233\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.790\nSo let's not do that and\nit prunes it out of the way to do stuff.\n\n234\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.720\nSo there's a lot of\ninformation right here.\n\n235\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.190\nBut the one that we want is at\nswitch port if I could spell it.\n\n236\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:43.450\nSwitchport trunk and encapsulation, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.690\nNow let's do one more question mark here.\n\n238\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.970\nAnd now you'll see that there's three\ndifferent ones that we have, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.910\nSo normally what's actually\nending up happening here,\n\n240\n00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.860\nof course, is that the automatic\nis the same as that negotiate.\n\n241\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.640\nIs what you're seeing here, right?\n\n242\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.820\nSo negotiate means device\nwill negotiate trunking and\n\n243\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.880\nencapsulation with\na peer on the interface.\n\n244\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.940\nSo whoever's connected to the other side,\n\n245\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.290\nit will set whatever it\nwants to on that side, okay.\n\n246\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.370\nNow, if we choose one of these other\ntwo that we are now hard setting it.\n\n247\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.230\nAnd if I want to hard\nset this being a trunk.\n\n248\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.190\nI need to also hard set the type of\nencapsulation that we are using.\n\n249\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.820\nNow I already told you that\nthe idea of .oneQ, technically,\n\n250\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.680\nis not an encapsulation.\n\n251\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.750\nBut I think that is\nequivalent to the original\n\n252\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.430\nencapsulation that they were using\nwhich is ISL, the inter switch linkage.\n\n253\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.210\nOkay, so when you start seeing this\nthis is what would end up happening.\n\n254\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.040\nSo originally, Cisco had their own\nproprietary way of encapsulating\n\n255\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.150\nframes that would come in, so that it\ncould identify what VLAN it was on.\n\n256\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.180\nThe easiest analogy and\nthe best analogy that I've heard on this,\n\n257\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.320\ncuz everybody explains it differently,\nis that when you use ISL or\n\n258\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.030\nISOL, as you'll hear people say,\nit's like taking that ethernet frame, and\n\n259\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.150\nwhen they say hey we're gonna\nuse ISL as the encapsulation,\n\n260\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.130\nit's like pouring red paint\nover the entire frame.\n\n261\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.830\nAnd then sticking your VLAN on it and\nsaying that's what the VLAN actually is.\n\n262\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.640\nNow the reason why that's fine,\nit allows you to work.\n\n263\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.350\nBut it's also easily spoofed too,\n\n264\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.438\nbecause that means somebody else\ncan come along and do what?\n\n265\n00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:24.730\nPour another color over it and\nthen put another VLAN on, and\n\n266\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.122\nyou're often ready to go, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:32.930\n.1Q is different in this sense is\nthat what it does is it takes that\n\n268\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:38.030\nethernet frame and it installs\ninserts in there a four byte or,\n\n269\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.430\nyeah, I think a four byte header,\ninside of it.\n\n270\n00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:48.120\nAnd it actually allows you to make\nsure that's 16 bits, that's two bytes.\n\n271\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.450\nSo I think it's two bytes or four bytes,\nI can't remember which one it actually is.\n\n272\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.836\nIt actually inserts it in between,\ninside of the frame itself,\n\n273\n00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:01.823\nessentially changing not only\nthe header in the frame, but\n\n274\n00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:04.433\nalso changing the actual FCS.\n\n275\n00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:10.810\nThough the, I can't remember what that's\ncalled, ACSU, the correction sequence,\n\n276\n00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.113\nframe check sequence, I couldn't remember-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:17.427\n&gt;&gt; So it actually changes that,so it\n\n278\n00:15:17.427 --> 00:15:22.070\nactually changes the entire frame\nwhen it leaves the switch, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.526\nSo if you think about that method, right,\nfor somebody to be able to do 802.1q and\n\n280\n00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:31.250\ngo ha,\nI'm gonna put another VLAN in its place.\n\n281\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.250\nThe frame check sequence also\nends up getting replaced as well.\n\n282\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.075\nAnd that becomes much more difficult.\n\n283\n00:15:37.075 --> 00:15:39.190\nSo in that instance,\nit's like taking dye and\n\n284\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.740\ninjecting it into the frame,\nwhich makes it much harder to get out.\n\n285\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.370\nCan it be done?\n\n286\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.130\nYes.\n\n287\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.117\nBut overall,\nthough it's a much more complex process.\n\n288\n00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:51.392\nToday, if the switch only supports 802.12\n\n289\n00:15:51.392 --> 00:15:56.288\ntrunking You normally don't\nhave to set DOT1Q, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:56.288 --> 00:16:00.584\nAll you have to do is do the idea\nof switch port trunk, and it says,\n\n291\n00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:06.073\nI only support one encapsulation method,\nand that's gonna be the idea of DOT1Q.\n\n292\n00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:08.600\nBut you will see some\nthat will still do this.\n\n293\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.671\nAnd if you're wondering why,\nit's because you still have some older\n\n294\n00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.469\nswitches out there that may not\nsupport anything but ISL, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:18.778\nSo if that's true, [COUGH] well,\n\n296\n00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:23.190\nthen you have to use whatever\nthat switch will support.\n\n297\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.360\nBut at lot of times on\nthese newer switches,\n\n298\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.460\nyou may see that ISL is not\neven an option for you.\n\n299\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.394\nSo for us,\nwe're going to set it to .1Q, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:33.450\nAnd this is gonna be switchport,\n\n301\n00:16:36.072 --> 00:16:41.715\nTrunk encapsulation .1q.\n\n302\n00:16:41.715 --> 00:16:46.213\nSo now that we've got\nthe .1q on the trunk, now,\n\n303\n00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:53.027\nI should be able to do a switchport mode\ntrunk which is hard setting this time.\n\n304\n00:16:53.027 --> 00:16:58.118\nSo now we've removed the automatic\nconfiguration on this particular\n\n305\n00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:02.870\ninterface to become trunking with\nthe other side on NYACCESS1.\n\n306\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.130\nAnd that's what we've actually\ndone at this point here, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.540\nSo, now let's verify this, do show\n\n308\n00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.760\ninterface trunk.\n\n309\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.100\nSo we are telling that to show us all the\ninterfaces that have trunking on them and\n\n310\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.130\nat this particular point,\n\n311\n00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:28.130\nthe very first two lines are what\nwe are really focusing in on.\n\n312\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:34.470\nIt tells me that on Fa1/0/22,\nI have turned the mode to on.\n\n313\n00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.839\nAnd when you see under mode it says on and\nnot auto that means,\n\n314\n00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:40.733\nRonnie has hard set this.\n\n315\n00:17:40.733 --> 00:17:42.786\nAnd if you hard set this, don't forget,\n\n316\n00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:46.850\nthat means you can't do the auto on the\nother thing and that's what it complains.\n\n317\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:52.410\nAlso, do the idea and make sure you\nunderstand the encapsulation mode.\n\n318\n00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.398\nHere's one of the errors that you may get,\n\n319\n00:17:55.398 --> 00:17:59.637\nit's that one side you set it\nto .1q on the encapsulation.\n\n320\n00:17:59.637 --> 00:18:04.890\nOn the other end, of this you set it\nto ISL, it will not work for you.\n\n321\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.394\nAnd that could be a great indicator\nof why you;re not receiving traffic\n\n322\n00:18:09.394 --> 00:18:12.090\nacross that trunk link as well.\n\n323\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.647\nThis is the other thing that tells\nyou whether it's trunking or\n\n324\n00:18:14.647 --> 00:18:15.670\nnot which is right here.\n\n325\n00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.750\nThe status itself tells you it's trunking.\n\n326\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.196\nSo if it is, it actually tells you it is\ntrunking which is good cuz that means\n\n327\n00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:28.008\nthe the traffic that it needs to go across\nthere is gonna go across that we need to.\n\n328\n00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:31.810\nAnd then of course it's Native Vlan,\nas well.\n\n329\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.210\nNative Vlan for\nus really only shows up at this point\n\n330\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.390\nwhen we start working with\nmultiple switches, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.890\nNow there's even a little bit\nmore information as well, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.919\nThe other thing that we see right now\non this trunk is, as we notice this,\n\n333\n00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:52.618\nit actually says look, I'll actually\nallow for VLANs 1 all the way\n\n334\n00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:57.740\nthrough 4,094 to go across this\ntrunk that's letting everything.\n\n335\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.494\nThat's every single- That's\nopen gates let it happen.\n\n336\n00:19:00.494 --> 00:19:02.185\nYeah, That's a default for\na reason, right.\n\n337\n00:19:02.185 --> 00:19:04.930\nSo you grab a switch and\nyou buy one you open the box and\n\n338\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.450\nyou plug it in everything works, right.\n\n339\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.252\nYeah, so that's that's\nthe reason it's actually there.\n\n340\n00:19:10.252 --> 00:19:16.642\nBut remember that doing this, it means\nthat hey, what if I don't have 4000 VLANs?\n\n341\n00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:19.464\nHeck, what if I don't\nhave a thousand VLANs?\n\n342\n00:19:19.464 --> 00:19:21.643\nWhat I may want to do instead,\n\n343\n00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:26.099\nis limit the actual amount of\ntraffic that also goes across.\n\n344\n00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:30.803\nSo there is a way instead,\nwhere it says on VLANs allowed on trunk,\n\n345\n00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:35.603\nis that we can configure this to\nonly allow, for at this point here.\n\n346\n00:19:35.603 --> 00:19:38.940\nVLANS, let's say one.\n\n347\n00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.070\nTen and 20 if we chose to, okay?\n\n348\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.780\nWell, if we do that, what does that mean?\n\n349\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.993\nThat means now, if Daniel is our\nhacker and he says I'm going to\n\n350\n00:19:47.993 --> 00:19:52.224\ncreate my own VLAN on this switch\ncuz I got access to the switch.\n\n351\n00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.932\nBut now, as he does that,\n\n352\n00:19:53.932 --> 00:19:58.680\nhe doesn't have access to everything\nelse on that switch as well.\n\n353\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.894\nHe has to be able to break into another\nVLAN before he can do anything.\n\n354\n00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:04.926\nBecause if it can't go across the trunk,\n\n355\n00:20:04.926 --> 00:20:09.400\nif he adds in VLAN 70 again,\nhe adds in VLAN 70 here.\n\n356\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.957\nAnd I don't allow it to go across the\ntrunk, he's stuck to essentially that one\n\n357\n00:20:13.957 --> 00:20:17.561\nswitch because that trunk will\nnot pass that other traffic, so\n\n358\n00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:19.073\nit can be allowed as well.\n\n359\n00:20:19.073 --> 00:20:23.170\nApparently also, you see VLANs allowed and\nactive in management domain.\n\n360\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.735\nAnd you see where it's already set to\nthis and the reason why is because these\n\n361\n00:20:26.735 --> 00:20:29.880\nare the ones that need to be managed and\nthat makes sense.\n\n362\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.052\nAnd then of course VLANs spanning trees\nboarding states are not pruned at\n\n363\n00:20:33.052 --> 00:20:33.632\nthis point.\n\n364\n00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:37.570\nThat's because we haven't set up\nanything like this as well, okay.\n\n365\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.999\nSo for us, we're not going to worry about\nthis last one because that's when we get\n\n366\n00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:42.302\ninto spanning tree protocol.\n\n367\n00:20:42.302 --> 00:20:46.468\nWe'll definitely talking more about that\nin depth inside of the CCNA routing and\n\n368\n00:20:46.468 --> 00:20:47.630\nswitch it.\n\n369\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.337\nBut for us here, it gives us all the\ninformation that we need at this point to\n\n370\n00:20:52.337 --> 00:20:53.853\nunderstand what we do.\n\n371\n00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:59.280\nNow, Daniel as I've set this all\nup taking a few minutes to do so.\n\n372\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.867\nWe now want to go to the other\nside of this, right?\n\n373\n00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:04.680\nWe've only configured\none part of the trunk.\n\n374\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.583\nAnd if everything that we want to\ndo was hard set to do this, right?\n\n375\n00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:11.631\nIt means we have to go to the other\nside and hard set it as well.\n\n376\n00:21:11.631 --> 00:21:14.570\nSo let's take a look at NY Access One.\n\n377\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.660\nAnd this time, we're just trying\nto determine some information.\n\n378\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.015\nLet me get that kind of down here on\nthe screen and make sure we can access it.\n\n379\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.230\nSo now that I'm back to verify couple\nof different things here, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:35.870\nLet's go ahead and do this, I wanna see\nif there's any trunks on this side.\n\n381\n00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.905\nCould be that I've mistakenly\ndone something here?\n\n382\n00:21:37.905 --> 00:21:39.670\nSo let's do a show.\n\n383\n00:21:42.355 --> 00:21:51.370\nInterface trunk, Daniel, look at\nthe very first two lines here though.\n\n384\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:55.754\nFA zero slash 24, this time notice this,\n\n385\n00:21:55.754 --> 00:21:59.782\nthe mode is no longer on, it is auto, and\n\n386\n00:21:59.782 --> 00:22:04.060\nit's doing 802.1q encapsulation.\n\n387\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:09.099\nIt is trunking, Native Vlan, it looks\nlike it's matching on the other side and\n\n388\n00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:12.360\nthis port is the one that\nis connected at my CORE1.\n\n389\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.184\nBut Daniel, you and\nI didn't have to setup a single thing.\n\n390\n00:22:14.184 --> 00:22:15.040\nDidn't do a thing.\n\n391\n00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.578\nOkay, did not do a single thing,\nand this is where,\n\n392\n00:22:17.578 --> 00:22:21.500\nremember where I said every single\nport wants to be- Just wants to trunk.\n\n393\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.481\nWants to trunk, and\n\n394\n00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:26.010\nthat because the default configuration\nis all over everything, okay.\n\n395\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.220\nSo when you do that,\nevery single one wants to do that.\n\n396\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.674\nAnd on the other side of hard\ndisk it goes, I can do that,\n\n397\n00:22:31.674 --> 00:22:33.151\nsure let's go ahead and do that.\n\n398\n00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.470\nWhy not?\n\n399\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.346\nLet's let it happen,\nlet's let everything end up working here.\n\n400\n00:22:38.346 --> 00:22:41.530\nAnd all that happens\nbecause of a protocol.\n\n401\n00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.495\nAnd this is where we're\ntalking about a protocol here.\n\n402\n00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:48.310\nIt's called DTP, or\nDynamic Trunking Protocol.\n\n403\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.821\nNormally, on the switches\nin the background,\n\n404\n00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:57.365\nDTP is turned on just about on every\nsingle switch that I know about, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:57.365 --> 00:23:00.061\nAnd it's turned on be default because\nthey want you to be able to plug in two\n\n406\n00:23:00.061 --> 00:23:02.230\nswitches together and go,\nall right, we're trunked.\n\n407\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.470\nDon't even worry about it, let's do it.\n\n408\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.320\nLet's do what we need to.\n\n409\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.573\nSo it will actually allow us to\ndo that without having to do much\n\n410\n00:23:08.573 --> 00:23:09.646\nconfiguration on.\n\n411\n00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:12.594\nSo they want that to happen.\n\n412\n00:23:12.594 --> 00:23:15.868\nBut here's the rule of thumb that I've\nlearned just over the years from everybody\n\n413\n00:23:15.868 --> 00:23:17.310\nI've ever talked to.\n\n414\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.733\nYou never want to allow trunks to\nauto negotiate for themselves.\n\n415\n00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.515\nBecause this is that scenario\nwe talked about previously.\n\n416\n00:23:24.515 --> 00:23:29.977\nDaniel realizes this the default\nbehaviour on the switch is a hacker and\n\n417\n00:23:29.977 --> 00:23:33.735\nhe now sets his network\nadapter to say trunking.\n\n418\n00:23:33.735 --> 00:23:36.078\nYeah.\nAnd then, he plugs into that switch and\n\n419\n00:23:36.078 --> 00:23:36.864\ngoes, Thank you.\n\n420\n00:23:36.864 --> 00:23:37.675\nI love you, thank you.\n\n421\n00:23:37.675 --> 00:23:39.280\n[LAUGH] I don't wanna become a trunk too.\n\n422\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.397\nI send a nice gift basket.\n\n423\n00:23:40.397 --> 00:23:41.775\n[LAUGH].\n\n424\n00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:44.191\nYeah, and that's exactly what happened,\nyou do send a gift basket.\n\n425\n00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:47.930\nAnd so that's what we're trying to avoid.\n\n426\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.632\nSo usually, the best rule of thumb.\n\n427\n00:23:50.632 --> 00:23:55.420\nTrunks in between switches,\nyou always want to hard code them, okay?\n\n428\n00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.880\nOn both sides.\n\n429\n00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.030\nThat's usually the rule of thumb here.\n\n430\n00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.240\nBut we wanted to show you both options.\n\n431\n00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.130\nSo you don't really have to do\nanything by default on this switch\n\n432\n00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.710\nand on the other one.\n\n433\n00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:12.280\nSo the other side, NYCORE1, is 3750, this\none right here on NYACCESS1 is a 2960.\n\n434\n00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.330\nIt doesn't matter,\nit wanted to trunk, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.850\nSo once we set the other side,\n\n436\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.290\nit said I'm trunking, I'll work,\nit's no big deal to me.\n\n437\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.870\nI'll let it actually happen and\n\n438\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.590\nwe don't have to worry about and\nanything like this at all, okay?\n\n439\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.770\nSo that's pretty much\nwhat's happening here.\n\n440\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:32.610\nNow, let's do a show VLAN brief,\n\n441\n00:24:34.644 --> 00:24:39.580\nIn our show VLAN brief though, here's\nthe problem that we're having, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.914\nSo I said that what we could do\nonce we started the trunking,\n\n443\n00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:47.920\nright, is that we're spanning VLANs from\none switch to multiple switches, right?\n\n444\n00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.050\nWell, Daniel, I don't see VLAN 10,\n\n445\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.960\nI don't see VLAN 20 here at all.\n&gt;&gt; Does not exist in\n\n446\n00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.840\nthis dojo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n447\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.740\nit doesn't look like it's actually\nexisting at this point, and\n\n448\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.870\nthat is a problem, okay?\n\n449\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.420\nNow, there's actually a couple of\nways we can solve this problem.\n\n450\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.230\nAnd that's why the lab is set\nup the way that it is, okay?\n\n451\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:12.040\nSo Daniel, with a single switch,\nwhat I would tell somebody, go ahead and\n\n452\n00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:18.420\ncreate the exact same VLANs on NYACCESS1\nas you created over on NYCORE1, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.040\nSo on another switch, and that's all\nwe were doing, I'd do that, okay?\n\n454\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.460\nEven if it was 15 VLANs, I'd tell you\njust hard code them in there, do that.\n\n455\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.690\nAnd guess what?\n\n456\n00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.380\nThat VLAN will now stay on and\nwe'll be fine, okay?\n\n457\n00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.980\nBut, Daniel, the reality though,\nis this, right,\n\n458\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.330\nin our production network, you don't know\nuntil you actually do that show VLAN.\n\n459\n00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.820\nAnd all of a sudden you see a list of,\nlet's say, 15 VLANs now, okay?\n\n460\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:47.310\nOr you see a list of\nlike I have 50 switches?\n\n461\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.624\nAnd now, Daniel, I'm saying.\n&gt;&gt; And they all need 15 VLANs.\n\n462\n00:25:50.624 --> 00:25:51.505\n&gt;&gt; And they all need 15 VLANs.\n\n463\n00:25:51.505 --> 00:25:54.675\nSo, Daniel, how fun does that sound?\n&gt;&gt; Zero fun sir.\n\n464\n00:25:54.675 --> 00:25:56.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Zero fun.\n\n465\n00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.720\nNow, we can make it faster.\n\n466\n00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.300\nYou and I know that all we have to\ndo is type the config out one time,\n\n467\n00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.419\nas far as VLAN making goes.\n&gt;&gt; Copy and paste it.\n\n468\n00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:05.240\n&gt;&gt; Copy and paste it across all 15, and\n\n469\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.400\nthat's fine.\n\n470\n00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.440\nBut that's not what we wanna do, okay?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n471\n00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.410\n&gt;&gt; What we wanna do is the lazy way,\n\n472\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.280\nI say lazy way.\n\n473\n00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.507\nThe way to take advantage-\n&gt;&gt; The least administrative effort.\n\n474\n00:26:13.507 --> 00:26:14.830\n&gt;&gt; The least administrative effort,\n\n475\n00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.399\nyeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n476\n00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:16.934\n&gt;&gt; The way to do this, of course,\n\n477\n00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:19.360\nis I wanna do exactly\nlike what we've done.\n\n478\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.170\nI configured it one time,\nI expect the VLANs to show up over here.\n\n479\n00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.440\nThat's what we wanna do, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.870\n&gt;&gt; I didn't expect it to not\n\n481\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.190\nhave VLANs 10 and 20 over here.\n\n482\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.950\nNot only that, I wanted them to be\nover here, but not to type them in.\n\n483\n00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.270\nWell, yes,\nif you want to manually do that, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.630\nThat's the way to go.\n\n485\n00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.020\nBut there is that protocol\nthat we were talking about,\n\n486\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.910\nwhich is VPT, virtual trunking protocol.\n\n487\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.100\nAnd what we'll have to do is we'll\njust have to configure both switches\n\n488\n00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.390\nto use virtual trunking protocol.\n\n489\n00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.970\nAnd then what we want\nwill begin to happen.\n\n490\n00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.460\nAnd as long as we bring in\nthose switches one at a time,\n\n491\n00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.451\nit will continue to just add, and those\nVLANs will actually be added across them.\n\n492\n00:26:57.451 --> 00:27:02.300\nSo that's what we'll actually be doing\nin our next little episode here,\n\n493\n00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.180\nas I've run out of time in our first\njaunt here into our multiple switch\n\n494\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.230\nconfiguration.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, they say it is fleeting,\n\n495\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.870\nand well,\n\n496\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.060\nI'm gonna have to agree with them on that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n497\n00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.667\n&gt;&gt; Because seems like right at every time\n\n498\n00:27:12.667 --> 00:27:14.940\nwe get to the good stuff,\nwe've got to call it a show.\n\n499\n00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.277\nBut not a problem though, right?\n\n500\n00:27:16.277 --> 00:27:18.758\nCuz now we can all take a break,\nhave a coke and a smile.\n\n501\n00:27:18.758 --> 00:27:21.500\nCome back and watch the next part,\nafter we film it, of course.\n\n502\n00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.030\nSo, Ronnie, I look forward to seeing\nyou in the studio on that one.\n\n503\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.990\nLooking forward to seeing you\ngood folks out there as well.\n\n504\n00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.090\nAs always, we do thank you for joining us.\n\n505\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.600\nBut it is that time for us to sign off.\n\n506\n00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.200\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n507\n00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n508\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.400\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next

Francisco,\nCalifornia, [INAUDIBLE]\n\n3\n00:00:06.251 --> 00:00:08.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.964\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:18.546\nwelcome back to another exciting episode\nof ITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:21.894\nAnd in today's episode, well, if you're\nback for more CCENT, well then you've come\n\n7\n00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:24.402\nto the right place, cuz we're\ndishing it up all day, every day.\n\n8\n00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:27.726\nAnd joining us in the studio, the head\nchef himself, our one good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:28.630\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.370\nRonnie, welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.370\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel,\n\n12\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.640\nthank you again for having me back in the\nstudio, as we continue on in our journey.\n\n13\n00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.020\nWe are in part two,\ntaking a look, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.250\nabout configuring multiple switches and\ngetting them to work together, and so,\n\n15\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.980\nthat's where we're picking up.\n\n16\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.442\nWe had left off in the last\nepisode where we created a VLAN,\n\n17\n00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:51.338\nwe also created a trunk,\nwe showed you the use and\n\n18\n00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:55.876\nthe working of dynamic trunking protocol\nworking on one of those switches.\n\n19\n00:00:55.876 --> 00:01:00.331\nSo that all we did is we configured one\nside, then the other side configured for\n\n20\n00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.502\nus and also told you,\nI don't want say it's a warning,\n\n21\n00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:07.305\nthe admonition by everybody that\nif you're going to do trunking.\n\n22\n00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:11.554\nThe recommendation, the best practice, the\none that most people in Cisco will laugh\n\n23\n00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:14.976\nat you for if they see you doing\nexactly what we're doing here in lab,\n\n24\n00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:17.600\nwhich is using dynamic trunking protocol.\n\n25\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.104\nBut it is turned on by default,\nso you can't blame somebody for\n\n26\n00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.503\ntaking advantage of it.\n\n27\n00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:25.997\nBut remember that if you take advantage\nof it it also means that a hacker,\n\n28\n00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:30.183\nsomeone that's skilled at actually trying\nto figure out what the weaknesses are, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:32.760\nDTP is one of the weaknesses that we have.\n\n30\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.754\nSo we've talked about that, now the other\nthing that we ended up seeing, right?\n\n31\n00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:40.604\nIn our lab here, is that at\nthe very end we tried to show you,\n\n32\n00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:44.993\nlet's take a look at our machine here,\nand I'll go to NYACCESS1,\n\n33\n00:01:44.993 --> 00:01:47.310\nthis hopefully will bring us back.\n\n34\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.560\nThere we go, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.700\nSo I was trying to demonstrate that\nwe did the show VLAN brief, and\n\n36\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.390\nI showed you what we were expecting to see\nusually the first time that we do this.\n\n37\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.030\nIs that once we create the trunk that the\nVLAN 10 and VLAN 20 that we created over\n\n38\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.440\non NYCORE1 would also show up right here\non NYACCESS1 and it didn't show up, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.750\nSo when it doesn't show up\nthat means that well, either\n\n40\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.520\nwe're still missing a configuration,\nor we've done something wrong.\n\n41\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.040\nAt this point we're\nmissing a configuration.\n\n42\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.644\nWe either manually have to go in and\ncreate them, and if you're actually going\n\n43\n00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:26.994\nto do that that's perfectly fine to do so\nand it works just as well, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:30.254\nBut the other way to do it\nis also by implementing VTP,\n\n45\n00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.570\nvirtual trunking protocol.\n\n46\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.480\nNow when we start talking about that\nthat is gonna be an exam objective for\n\n47\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.290\nthe CCNA routing and\n\n48\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.580\nswitching, we're going over just very\nquickly the basics and the configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.600\nHere we're not getting into\na lot of detailed explanation.\n\n50\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.330\nWe'll point out a few things, but that's\nwhen we'll probably set up a more detailed\n\n51\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.400\nlab, and making sure you understand\nhow this ends up working for us.\n\n52\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.500\nSo that's what we need to do\nat this point as well, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.900\nBecause we showed you that that's\nactually a scalable solution.\n\n54\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.600\nAnd even though you don't see it\nimplemented super often anymore,\n\n55\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.870\nthat's because there's different\nways to manage switches today, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.621\nThrough web consoles and stuff like\nthat that you don't have to worry about.\n\n57\n00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.696\n&gt;&gt; They try to make it too easy for\n\n58\n00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:13.521\nthese young kids man.\n\n59\n00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:15.643\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, too easy.\n\n60\n00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:16.998\n[LAUGH] That's right, yeah.\n\n61\n00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:18.854\nSo, this way you don't\nhave to worry about, but\n\n62\n00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:21.330\nyou still need to know about\nit at least for the exam.\n\n63\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.260\nSo that's what they have set up for\nyou in the lab to do\n\n64\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.460\nis the next thing you were actually\nimplementing of course, is VTP, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.720\nSo let's switch on over here to my\ndiagram, and this will help us to\n\n66\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.900\nunderstand some of the configurations\nwe'll be putting on both sides.\n\n67\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.770\nNow this you'll have to manually configure\nwhen you do something like this, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.314\nSo when you set up virtual trunking\nprotocol is exactly like it sounds, right?\n\n69\n00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:50.437\nIt is doing something so\nthat both of these switches will\n\n70\n00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:54.190\nessentially allow you to set this up,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.421\nSo in VTP here, that's what, and\nyou know what there's always something,\n\n72\n00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:59.323\nI always call it virtual\ntrunking protocol.\n\n73\n00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:04.040\nBut it may be VLAN trunking protocol for\nall I know, I don't know why.\n\n74\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.810\nMy mind has actually disappeared on the\nactual proper naming of what this thing\n\n75\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.300\nactually stands for.\n\n76\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.900\nBut VTP is the protocol here\nthat allows for VLAN to appear.\n\n77\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.820\nSo if I configure one side,\n\n78\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.060\nthe VLANs will also get configured over\non another switch, if we do so, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.568\nThe neat thing about it is,\nwhat you're trying to do, right?\n\n80\n00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:28.811\nIs that you're trying to make sure just\nabout everything else here is matching\n\n81\n00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.270\nexcept for really one component of\nwhat we're seeing on the screen, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.070\nSo we'll point that out too.\n\n83\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.030\nWhen you set up VTP,\n\n84\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.230\nthere are a few elements that\nare absolutely 100% required, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.670\nAnd not every element is, but in our\nlive setting, it's going to be, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.000\nOne, you need to set up a VTP domain name.\n\n87\n00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.860\nAnd this is the one they have set up for\nus in our lab guide here,\n\n88\n00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.920\nwhich is vtp.practice-labs.com.\n\n89\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.240\nSo that's the one we'll be using.\n\n90\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.750\nThe other thing that you actually need\nto setup is what we call VTP mode.\n\n91\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.100\nNow this the only one that will be\ndifferent on other ones too, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.454\nSo when we see this,\n\n93\n00:05:08.454 --> 00:05:13.482\nnormally inside of where you're\nrunning with multiple switches, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:13.482 --> 00:05:17.821\nYou're normally gonna set one switch as\nbeing what we call the VTP server, it\n\n95\n00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:22.589\ndoesn't always have to be one switch, you\ncan set those sides as being the servers.\n\n96\n00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.010\nBut the difference of this\nis fairly simple, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.440\nIf you set one side as being a server,\nlet me see if I can move that text box so\n\n98\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.765\nI can get a little bit of typing donehere.\n\n99\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.976\nvtp server, and\nget it off of a black text, yeah,\n\n100\n00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:40.115\nthat would show up very nicely, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.790\nAnd vtp server, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.963\nEssentially gives us\nthis ability to create,\n\n103\n00:05:48.963 --> 00:05:54.213\nwhich I can't spell create,\ndelete, and manage vlans.\n\n104\n00:05:57.001 --> 00:06:00.360\nAll right, so\nit allows us to be able to do that, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.570\nNow, the other thing\nthat it allows us to do,\n\n106\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.480\nof course, is that that's pretty much\nthe kinda key idea here, is that this is\n\n107\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.350\nthe one where if you modify anything, it's\ngoing to allow you to do everything, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.220\nWhich is the VTP server.\n\n109\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:21.561\nYou can also set up\nthe possibility of a VTP client.\n\n110\n00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:29.236\nNow a VTP client,\nyou can't create VLANs on it,\n\n111\n00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:34.870\nSo there is no creating,\nthere is no deleting, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.626\nAll you're doing is you're being\nupdated by the VTP server, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:46.301\nSo any changes made on the VTP server\nwill filter down to the VTP client, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.220\nIs what you'll also end up seeing.\n\n115\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.107\nNow there are times that you may\nend up also needing that one\n\n116\n00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:58.216\nparticular switch to stand alone and\nnot be updated, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:58.216 --> 00:07:03.450\nBut also have its particular\nVLANs also not update the entire\n\n118\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.486\nnetwork as well, and\nthat is called transparent, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:12.246\nSo this one functions standalone.\n\n120\n00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:15.945\nAll right, now we're not gonna get\ninto anymore explanation of that but\n\n121\n00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:18.650\nthat's what we're trying to get to, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.800\nSo to learn more make sure you go and view\nthe CCNA routing and switching show, and\n\n123\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.822\nwe'll talk about that much more in-depth\nand show you how that ends of working.\n\n124\n00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:30.535\nAnd it's kind of a neat pattern of ways\nthat things end up happening here, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:37.140\nWe're gonna set up one side\nas being the VTP server, And\n\n126\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.401\nthen this is optional in our lab\nwhich is the vtp password, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:46.026\nSo even though it's optional I've\nnever actually done it without it, so\n\n128\n00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:47.613\nI'm gonna leave that in there.\n\n129\n00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:52.280\nThe password allows us to ensure that\nsomeone like Daniel doesn't come along\n\n130\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.939\nand go Ha.\n\n131\n00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.652\nI already see what the domain name\nbecause you can see what the domain\n\n132\n00:07:55.652 --> 00:07:56.210\nname is.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n133\n00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.872\nyou can.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n134\n00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:57.540\nPerfectly fine.\n\n135\n00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.490\nOkay?\nYou can even see what mode it's in but you\n\n136\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.150\ncan't see what the password is normally.\n&gt;&gt; I don't like these\n\n137\n00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.041\nobfuscations, Ronnie.\n\n138\n00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:04.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n139\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.145\nNormally, you can't do that.\n\n140\n00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:09.325\nBut it will show up in the running config,\nif you don't have that service\n\n141\n00:08:09.325 --> 00:08:13.770\npassword-encryptionset but overall though,\nyou'll actually be able to see that.\n\n142\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.720\nNow, there are three different\nversions of VLAN, VTP out there.\n\n143\n00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.690\nWe're gonna use the latest one.\n\n144\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.920\nThat's what our lab is configured for and\nthat requires one extra step and we'll\n\n145\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.700\nshow you where that comes in, which is VTP\nprimary when we get ready for it, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.700\nThe other side like I said, you're going\nto essentially just make it match.\n\n147\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.800\nLet me move this and move that around, so\nwe'll have to do too much of the in and\n\n148\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.960\nout of the full screen here too much.\n\n149\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.296\nBut they are going to, everything that\nyou see here is gonna be key now,\n\n150\n00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:55.287\nthere is one kind of hand hair\nthat you wanna check as well,\n\n151\n00:08:55.287 --> 00:08:59.820\njust in case that shows up on\nthe c setting exam too, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.360\nThe domain name is case sensitive.\n\n153\n00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.570\nSo if you see this, where the first\npart of this is actually capital VTP and\n\n154\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.050\nthe other side is lower case vtp,\nit's not going to work.\n\n155\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.110\nIt's actually going to balk\nat you when you do that.\n\n156\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.740\nSo, the domain name is case sensitive\nalong with a password that should\n\n157\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.958\nbe common sense.\n\n158\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.940\nBut overall though, these are the\nconfigurations that we need to set and\n\n159\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.410\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n160\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.450\nTo try and\nhelp us to get what we want, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.240\nSo remember right now that NYCORE1,\nwe have VLANs 10 and 20.\n\n162\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.970\nAnd then on NYACCESS1,\nwe have nothing, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.140\nSo after setting up these two\nconfigurations, it should, well,\n\n164\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.690\nseem like magically appear.\n&gt;&gt; Should, yeah.\n\n165\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have to say should because\n\n166\n00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:45.290\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Nothing's a given in this life, Ronnie.\n\n167\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.800\n&gt;&gt; It really isn't and\n\n168\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.330\nespecially in the lab setting, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Death and\n\n169\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.700\ntaxes, that's about it.\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n170\n00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.840\nwhatever reason,\nJust like I showed you in another episode.\n\n171\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.840\nI typed in the command and it said no and\nthen I had to type it in again and\n\n172\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.700\nit finally let us actually\nsee that information.\n\n173\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.620\nSo it's just kind of a hit or\nmiss at sometimes when we do this.\n\n174\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.890\nAll right, so on NYCORE1, we're gonna\nset this one up as being our server.\n\n175\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.830\nNow let me get in to\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n176\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.856\nAnd from this point here, before we\ndo anything else, let's do a do show\n\n177\n00:10:18.856 --> 00:10:24.560\nVTP status, just so that we can\nsee some information here, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.610\nSo at this point, you are seeing\nthat it is capable of running\n\n179\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:33.740\nVTP version 1 through 3, currently,\nit's running version 1, which is fine.\n\n180\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.580\nNotice there's no VTP Domain, we don't\nhave any pruning, it's disabled here.\n\n181\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.210\nAnd there's also no configuration,\nwhich is fine.\n\n182\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.320\nThis is kinda the key right here, if you\never need to trouble shoot whether or\n\n183\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.450\nnot things are working correctly\nis right here at the end, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.000\nThis is an ND5 hash, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n185\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.700\n&gt;&gt; So if you're never not sure,\n\n186\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.150\nyou, for some reason you're eyeballing it.\n\n187\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.080\nDomain name matches,\nI know the password is correct,\n\n188\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.600\nI known the mode is correct,\nyou're just not seeing it.\n\n189\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.700\nAll you have to do is just go and\ncheck out the MD5 hash.\n\n190\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.320\nIf that's different, you know that\nsomewhere you've configured something\n\n191\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.020\nwrong and then you just issue a no-vtp\ndomain, no-vtp password, you know?\n\n192\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.400\nGet rid of all that and\nstart all over and do that.\n\n193\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.840\nOkay, this is the other\nthing of course as well,\n\n194\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.200\nwhich is the operating mode currently it\nis set up to be server which is fine.\n\n195\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.830\nAnd that's pretty much about it, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.000\nSo, we'll get much more in-depth and\n\n197\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.010\nwe'll talk about some of these\nother things a little bit later on.\n\n198\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.570\nBut for right now,\nthat's all that we're doing, okay.\n\n199\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.730\nSo what we're saying is nothing is set up,\nokay.\n\n200\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.360\nAnd once I do this.\n\n201\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.450\nNow that we're in a global configuration\nmode, let's set up the VTP domain.\n\n202\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:50.115\nVTP domain, then there's gonna\nbe vtp.practice-labs.com.\n\n203\n00:11:50.115 --> 00:11:54.520\nThen VTP mode server, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.730\nNotice that I'm getting\nsyslog messages already.\n\n205\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:03.060\nThat are coming accross here, and\nis saying VLAN and then 6 VTP domain\n\n206\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.975\nname change is changed to practice\nto vtppractice-labs.com vtp.\n\n207\n00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:14.055\nA device has already been in server mode,\nthose complaining like, yeah,\n\n208\n00:12:14.055 --> 00:12:19.075\nI was ready on server mode, no big deal,\nthat's perfectly fine, okay, so\n\n209\n00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:23.995\nalso then, let's do a vtp version 3 here.\n\n210\n00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:29.268\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna set up vtp password as well and\n\n211\n00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:34.630\nwe're gonna do CCET just as an example,\nhopefully, I can remember that.\n\n212\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.300\nRight, so we're also,\nwe've just gotten another message, right?\n\n213\n00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:45.160\nVLAN old config file red, old version two,\nVLAN configuration file detected, files\n\n214\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.950\nwill be written in the future too and\nthen also of course with a password here.\n\n215\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.030\nSo this will allow us to,\nactually, that's me typing it in.\n\n216\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.082\nSo it would be written in the future,\ntoo, whatever it said here, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:58.082 --> 00:12:58.880\nSo that's fine.\n\n218\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.600\nSo we've got this side set up.\n\n219\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.830\nEverything should be fine for us here.\n\n220\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.448\nLet's type in a do.\n\n221\n00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:09.150\nShow VTP Status.\n\n222\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.540\nAll right, so it's reset everything.\n\n223\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.210\nNow everything's actually set to this\nkind of 000 which is a little bit more\n\n224\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.380\nunusual here.\n\n225\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.340\nBut we'll see some of the other things\nthat are happening in just a moment.\n\n226\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.620\nYeah, once everything gets\nconfigured on both sides,\n\n227\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.710\nwe should get something else besides\nthis MD5 hash for right now.\n\n228\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.200\nSo that's fine.\n\n229\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.269\nNow that we've got that on one side,\n\n230\n00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:39.601\nlet's go over to NYACCESS1 and also,\n\n231\n00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:45.400\nset up NYACCESS1 in the same\nmanner as well, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:51.580\nI have to type it in correctly,\nshow VTP status.\n\n233\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.370\nAnd you'll see, it's really not actually\ncurrently enabled for anything right now\n\n234\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.450\nor anything that's kind of set but\nnotice this though Daniel, okay?\n\n235\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.660\nThings are already\nstarting to happen here.\n\n236\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.970\nWe did not configure this, okay?\n\n237\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.990\nAnd that is because there\nare some things that The VTP,\n\n238\n00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.810\nit may be running in the background.\n\n239\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.510\nAnd it's set to auto.\n&gt;&gt; We love that auto.\n\n240\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.180\n&gt;&gt; I know, we love that auto, so.\n\n241\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Which probably means there's some sort\n\n242\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.600\nof insecurity that's gonna happen here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.750\n&gt;&gt; It can, right?\n\n244\n00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.460\nSo that's one of the things where\nyou actually do have this set and\n\n245\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.870\nit automatically starts to do this.\n\n246\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.200\nSo a lot of times it is built to do this.\n\n247\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.990\nBut the one thing that we\ndidn't set on the side and\n\n248\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.900\nthat's why I also set up the password,\nis so that it comes up.\n\n249\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.970\nAnd it's going to say hey,\nthere is a password that's needed before\n\n250\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.020\nwe can configure and\ndo everything else that we need to.\n\n251\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.200\nBut at this point it's not there.\n\n252\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.480\nSo let's go ahead and\nconfigure this again, just to make sure.\n\n253\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.392\nSo we'll do VTP domain and\n\n254\n00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:59.835\nthen we'll do VTP practice-labs.com.\n\n255\n00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:01.630\nSo it says, hey, you've already done this.\n\n256\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.940\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n257\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.450\nJust a verification here, right, VTP mode.\n\n258\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:10.650\nThis time,\nI'm gonna set this one up to be client.\n\n259\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.450\nAll right?\n\n260\n00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.340\nSo now we're setting\nthis up to be a client.\n\n261\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.900\nAnd remember what that means.\n\n262\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.680\nI won't be able to configure\na VLAN on the client.\n\n263\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.370\nI can only configure it on the server and\n\n264\n00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.610\nthen the server will allow that to\npass down through what we have, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.506\nNow, I also need, what else was it?\n\n266\n00:15:26.506 --> 00:15:29.670\nVTP version, VTP version 3.\n\n267\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:38.737\nRight now, and then we'll do a VTP,\n\n268\n00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:42.884\npassword, ccent.\n\n269\n00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:44.860\nAll right, so everything looks good there.\n\n270\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.146\nLet's do a do show VTP status this time.\n\n271\n00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:51.748\nWe'll verify that everything notes, yep.\n\n272\n00:15:51.748 --> 00:15:56.430\nSo now, we've got it separating out as\nbeing a client, which is perfectly fine.\n\n273\n00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.744\nAnd just making sure that everything\nwe're looking for is, oops.\n\n274\n00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:00.530\nWhat did I do there?\n\n275\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.531\nI just clicked on something and it-\n&gt;&gt; You've ruined it now, Mike.\n\n276\n00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:04.323\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n277\n00:16:04.323 --> 00:16:05.026\nit went away.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:16:05.026 --> 00:16:06.070\n&gt;&gt; It just disappeared.\n\n279\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.860\nHere we go.\n\n280\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.950\nThat's always a great thing.\n\n281\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.160\nAll right, so both sides are now\nset up in that way that we can,\n\n282\n00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.180\nand everything else is showing up here.\n\n283\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.380\nLet's verify one more thing.\n\n284\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.503\nI wanna verify that the VLANs\nhaven't come across yet,\n\n285\n00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:27.230\nso show, do show VLAN brief.\n\n286\n00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:32.979\nSo just there that we see now,\nbut there is something, actually,\n\n287\n00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:34.210\nit did come across.\n\n288\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.310\nSo I guess as soon as\nI set up the password.\n\n289\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.640\nSo, Daniel,\nright here I am on NYACCESS1, and\n\n290\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.420\nright before this we showed you\nwhere there were no VLAN's on it.\n\n291\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.650\nAnd there it is, it was that fast.\n&gt;&gt; Super fast.\n\n292\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just came right across.\n\n293\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.140\nI was hoping that it would just delay for\na moment before it actually set it up.\n\n294\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.190\nBut with me talking,\nit just went ahead and picked it up.\n\n295\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.750\nSo you and I never set this up,\nand now it's actually doing that.\n\n296\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.490\nNow, let's verify and see if the client\nand the server model is working.\n\n297\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.290\nSo it kinda stole my thunder with me like,\nlook, watch this, well.\n\n298\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.820\nSo all right, so let's do VLAN.\n\n299\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.410\nVLAN 30 here, and this is the side\nthat's set up as a client.\n\n300\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.750\nNow, notice it gives us a warning, right?\n\n301\n00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.180\nVTP VLAN configuration not allowed\nwhen a device as set in client mode.\n\n302\n00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.570\nSo it is doing that.\n\n303\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.310\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nwhy the heck does that matter?\n\n304\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.380\nWell, imagine this, Daniel.\n\n305\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.180\nLet's say that what we did is that\nwe put all of our new hires for\n\n306\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.980\nwhatever business that we are in on.\n\n307\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.690\nThe first four are over in\na room on the west side.\n\n308\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.000\nAnd somebody goes I can manipulate\na Cisco switch, I can do that.\n\n309\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.420\nAnd what they would do, they'd go is watch\nthis, I'll create six or seven VLANs and\n\n310\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.310\njust let it do what it wants to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, this way they know that\n\n312\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.650\nthey can't do it.\n\n313\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.500\nIt's not gonna allow them to do\nthat because you'll control it from\n\n314\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.070\na centralized location.\n\n315\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.350\nSo this great in something like schools,\nright, where there may be a switch in\n\n316\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.540\nevery classroom.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n317\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.170\n&gt;&gt; And somebody just goes I watched this,\n\n318\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.140\nI can do this.\n\n319\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.800\nNow, you set up every switch\nas being in the client.\n\n320\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.580\nAnd then you, or Daniel,\nwhoever the administrator is,\n\n321\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.330\nthey just remote into that\none switch that's a server.\n\n322\n00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.440\nAnd he's the one that gets\nto actually add VLANs or\n\n323\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.230\nremove them, or whatever.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n324\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.520\nRonnie, what if I bring in my rogue\nswitch and I set it up as a server?\n\n325\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.010\nIs there gonna be a fight, or\nis it just gonna allow it to happen?\n\n326\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.930\n&gt;&gt; It will allow it to connect, but\n\n327\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.220\nunless it matches up with a password and\ndomain name.\n\n328\n00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.891\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget that,\n\n329\n00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:23.480\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n330\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.340\nit should not actually allow\nit to do anything else.\n\n331\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.810\nSo once you configure domain name and\n\n332\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.230\npassword, that's why it's always key\nto set up a password when you do this.\n\n333\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:36.350\nSo even if they go okay, I can find what\nthe domain names is, but they shouldn't\n\n334\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.000\nfind what password is very easily.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n335\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.640\n&gt;&gt; And you should never\n\n336\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.040\nuse as easy as I did.\n\n337\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.810\nSo that's never a good thing, but that's\njust an sample of what can happen, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.760\nSo all that is now set\nup at this point too.\n\n339\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.140\nSo, Daniel, I should be able\nto go to NYCORE1 now, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.610\nAnd then from core one, let's see\nif I can configure the VLAN here.\n\n341\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.578\nSo let's do VLAN 30.\n\n342\n00:18:58.578 --> 00:19:02.130\nNow, Daniel, there's a problem, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:07.957\nVTP VLAN configuration not allowed when\na device is not the primary server for\n\n344\n00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:10.000\nVLAN database.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n345\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, what the heck is this about?\n\n346\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.335\nOkay, so well, this is where those\nversion numbers matter, okay?\n\n347\n00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:17.440\nSo in version one or two, it doesn't care.\n\n348\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.730\nIt lets you do it all day long, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.570\nVersion three though, says yeah, because\nthere's a possibility and a scalability of\n\n350\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.538\nthis network, you might see more than one\nVLAN server, or VTP server out there.\n\n351\n00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:32.860\nIt says no, if you really\nwant to configure this, okay,\n\n352\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:38.080\nwhat you can do instead is if you set it\nto version three, two things will happen.\n\n353\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.900\nIt has to actually have a primary server,\nokay?\n\n354\n00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.420\nA primary server to do this, and\n\n355\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.050\nthat's the only one that you'll\nbe able to configure VLANs from.\n\n356\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.677\nSo even if you have other VLAN servers out\nthere, because you've added them in and\n\n357\n00:19:50.677 --> 00:19:54.254\nnow they've populated and they've done\njust like what we did at the beginning,\n\n358\n00:19:54.254 --> 00:19:55.690\nit doesn't get to allow you to.\n\n359\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.770\nDaniel goes, crap, he just added it in.\n\n360\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.640\nIt's a server,\nI know I can change it right now, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.060\nSo instead, you set up the first\nprimary one and you mark it as primary.\n\n362\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.110\nAnd that way it It doesn't matter\nwhether it's the auto config or not,\n\n363\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.440\nwhether it's set to server,\nwhich is what it normally is by default,\n\n364\n00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.710\nit will go ahead and do it.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n365\n00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.080\nI just wanna make sure\nI'm following you here.\n\n366\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.430\nWhen we do that version three, we have\na primary server we set up and say, yep,\n\n367\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.040\nthere's my primary server.\n\n368\n00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.380\nAnd even though we have other servers,\nwe can't do any administrative\n\n369\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.930\ntasks on our VLANs, basically,\nIf it's not on that primary server,\n\n370\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.120\nis that correct?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n371\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.830\n&gt;&gt; If that is the case,\n\n372\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.510\nwhich Ronnie says that it is,\n\n373\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.810\nif you think about it it's\nactually a better way to do it.\n\n374\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:36.020\nBecause all my configuration\nis done from one place.\n\n375\n00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.410\nI don't have to worry about, yeah,\n\n376\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:42.330\nyou can think of it as a convenience to\ngo to any of the servers and configure.\n\n377\n00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.397\nBut if you know have to log into this one\nevery time, it can eliminate some mistakes\n\n378\n00:20:45.397 --> 00:20:46.880\nyou might make.\n&gt;&gt; It does, and\n\n379\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.536\nthat's version three is recommended,\nbut there are devices out there\n\n380\n00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:55.081\nthat don't support version three.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n381\n00:20:55.081 --> 00:20:55.907\n&gt;&gt; So usually, yeah,\n\n382\n00:20:55.907 --> 00:20:57.664\nusually there would be version one or two.\n\n383\n00:20:57.664 --> 00:20:58.951\nAnd those two don't really matter.\n\n384\n00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:01.681\nBut the advantage of this is something\nlike what we're seeing right here.\n\n385\n00:21:01.681 --> 00:21:03.810\nA little bit more security in that sense.\n\n386\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.560\nIt's not the strongest security in\nthe world, but it does allow you to go,\n\n387\n00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.905\nall right, my footprint is much smaller\nin terms of control and configuration.\n\n388\n00:21:09.905 --> 00:21:10.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n389\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.318\n&gt;&gt; But what it also does,\n\n390\n00:21:12.318 --> 00:21:17.111\nit allows you to use those extended VLANs,\nall the 4096.\n\n391\n00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:20.810\nNow, when you do VTP,\nit will allow you to do some of that.\n\n392\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.890\nBut if you really wanna get\nout every ounce of that,\n\n393\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.850\nversion three is the one that says I'll\nessentially recognize all the way through,\n\n394\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.990\neven though it says I can't do that.\n\n395\n00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:34.523\nMost of us will never\never do like VLAN 38 45.\n\n396\n00:21:34.523 --> 00:21:35.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:21:35.115 --> 00:21:35.633\n&gt;&gt; Can you?\n\n398\n00:21:35.633 --> 00:21:36.352\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:21:36.352 --> 00:21:38.320\n&gt;&gt; But not normally, right?\n\n400\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.460\nSo when you do something like that,\n\n401\n00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.540\neven the switches are going\nI don't really recognize.\n\n402\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.710\nI was hoping for anything under 1001,\nit's what I was hoping for, but\n\n403\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.230\nthat's what you're ending up seeing here.\n\n404\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.750\nBut VTP will allow you to use\nthose upper numbers as well, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.900\nBut that doesn't really help us or\nhurt us in any particular fashion,\n\n406\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.110\nunless we're on a really really big\nnetwork, and we need multiple okay?\n\n407\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.770\nSo how do we set up then the idea\nhere of this VTP primary?\n\n408\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:13.343\nSo if I type in VTP primary as what,\n\n409\n00:22:13.343 --> 00:22:18.350\noops, let's see, VTP.\n\n410\n00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.400\nLet's do that question mark here\ncuz I'm now kind of stumped here.\n\n411\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.359\nAll right, so as I'm looking at this\nhere .I'm starting to realize something.\n\n412\n00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:28.220\nIt's saying hey look,\nthis is not correct here.\n\n413\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:34.110\nSo I just realize I need to not be\ninside of the global configuration mode,\n\n414\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.470\nwhich is my mistake.\n\n415\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:40.030\nI need to be out here under privileged\nEXEC mode, then I can do VTP primary.\n\n416\n00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.380\nAnd now, there we go.\n\n417\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.210\nI was starting to kinda like,\nI keep hitting it,\n\n418\n00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.690\nI was like,\nI know that's the proper configuration.\n\n419\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.331\nI typed it out and\nmade sure that it was a proper one,\n\n420\n00:22:51.331 --> 00:22:55.090\nI just mistyped in my notes here, and\nI left it at global configuration.\n\n421\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.784\n&gt;&gt; Don't you love it when you do that?\n\n422\n00:22:55.784 --> 00:22:56.865\nIt's fun.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n423\n00:22:56.865 --> 00:22:57.707\nI love it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:22:57.707 --> 00:22:58.995\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, okay.\n\n425\n00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:00.435\nSo we have to give it a moment, and\n\n426\n00:23:00.435 --> 00:23:04.255\nnow you see where it says this system has\nbecome primary server for future VLAN.\n\n427\n00:23:04.255 --> 00:23:08.090\nNo conflicting VTP devices found, confirm.\n\n428\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.130\nAnd I'm going to press enter,\nand now I've confirmed it.\n\n429\n00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.450\nSo now, let's go back into our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n430\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.560\nAnd once I do this,\nI should now be able to do VLAN 30,\n\n431\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.180\nand then give it a name here.\n\n432\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.240\nAnd I don't know if I actually put any\nparticular, Test is what I made it.\n\n433\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:34.760\nDo show VLAN brief to verify that we\nhad everything that we needed to.\n\n434\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.690\nAnd there it is again.\n\n435\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.120\nLook at that, Daniel.\n\n436\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.190\nI created the proper VLAN, and\nit's still not [CROSSTALK].\n\n437\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.380\nIt's amazing.\n\n438\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.760\nYeah, I think there's gotta be something\nwith this particular switch here.\n\n439\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.905\nThat's the only thing I would\nactually know at this point.\n\n440\n00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:54.045\nDo show VLAN brief.\n\n441\n00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.662\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n442\n00:23:57.662 --> 00:24:02.410\nSo finally, you now see where I can\nconfigure this particular VLAN on\n\n443\n00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.180\nthe one that's also designated as\nbeing the primary VLAN as well, okay?\n\n444\n00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.450\nSo we've got that portion of\nwhat we actually need done.\n\n445\n00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.020\nAt this point, when we configure this, and\n\n446\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.690\nwe make sure that everything can be done,\nokay?\n\n447\n00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:21.280\nSo once we actually do that, right,\nthere's still a bit more for\n\n448\n00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.200\nus to go, but we'll have to do\nthat in another part because I've\n\n449\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.580\nrun up against the time limit once again,\nDaniel.\n\n450\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.070\nSo it looks like we are coming back for\n\n451\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.840\na part three on this particular lab.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n452\n00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.820\nI can respect a man that knows his limits.\n\n453\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.780\nAnd it looks like we've come to yours for\nat least this episode anyway.\n\n454\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.828\nI know that Ronnie is gonna dazzle us\nwhen we come back for the next show.\n\n455\n00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:42.960\nSo, he likes to find good stopping spots,\nwhich he does so well.\n\n456\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.360\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today,\nthanks for helping us get thus far, we got\n\n457\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.760\nplenty to chew on and to ruminate about\nbefore we come back to that next part.\n\n458\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.430\nBut definitely come back and\n\n459\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.390\nsee Ronnie finish this VTP business up\nbecause it's extremely helpful when\n\n460\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.200\nit comes to configuring multiple\nswitches inside of a domain.\n\n461\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.100\nVery good stuff.\n\n462\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.860\nRonnie, thanks again for joining us,\nand we do thank you for watching, but\n\n463\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.890\nguess what?\n\n464\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.520\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n465\n00:25:05.520 -->

today's episode we are moving on,\n\n8\n00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.560\nmoving forward and trying to get some\nmore information with this whole CCENT\n\n9\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.860\nseries we've been working on.\n\n10\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.550\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto dish out that info for\n\n11\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.950\nus to learn from,\nour good man Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.000\nRonnie, we're glad to have you back,\nand how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.210\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.080\nThank you for having me back so that I\ncan complete this lab that we're on.\n\n15\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.160\n&gt;&gt; We have faith in you, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.967\n&gt;&gt; And it's just one of those things,\nI keep talking, and\n\n17\n00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:43.858\nthere's a lot of stuff here\nthat you do need to practice.\n\n18\n00:00:43.858 --> 00:00:46.686\nSo make sure you go back through\nthis lab and walk through it,\n\n19\n00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:50.070\nexplain it to yourself as you go through,\njust like I'm doing it.\n\n20\n00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.685\nThat way it gets into your mind\nas you do that as well, okay?\n\n21\n00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.840\nAnd we're just picking up\nwhere we left off last time.\n\n22\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.940\nWe had just finished creating,\nof course, the idea of using VTP.\n\n23\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.404\nWhere we could show you that you had to\nhave a server before you could actually\n\n24\n00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:06.620\nsee the VLAN span across\nthe second switch.\n\n25\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.099\nSo now we want to go into\nthat second switch and\n\n26\n00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:11.768\nwe want to hard configure the other side.\n\n27\n00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:14.440\nWe don't wanna leave one side as\nbeing dynamic trunk in protocol and\n\n28\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.720\nthe other side as being hard set.\n\n29\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.180\nSo lets go back to NYACCESS1.\n\n30\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.375\nAnd there's not a lot of explanation\nthat I need to give right here, right?\n\n31\n00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:28.713\nWe're essentially duplicating the effort\nthat we have already done over on NYCORE1.\n\n32\n00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:33.500\nSo let's go ahead and\njust get access into this, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.044\nSo lets set up the trunking here,\ninterface.\n\n34\n00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.272\nFA.\n\n35\n00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:43.110\nBefore I do that,\nI think this is supposed to be,\n\n36\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.770\nnow I have to actually find out what\ninterface I was on, that's the only thing.\n\n37\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.450\nAnd I think I have it typed wrong here,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n38\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.976\nSo let's do, do show.\n\n39\n00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.227\nInterface.\n\n40\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.801\nBrief.\n\n41\n00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.456\nIP interface brief, but even in a Switch,\nIP interface brief will work for us.\n\n42\n00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:14.521\nLet me make sure cuz I just looked down on\nmy notes, I'm like that's not right, okay,\n\n43\n00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.361\nit's gonna be FA0/24, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:21.016\nSo that's all I needed to verify cuz\nI was about type in FA1/0/ something.\n\n45\n00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:24.562\nInterface FA0/24,\n\n46\n00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:28.958\nif I remember correctly here.\n\n47\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:35.150\nNow, we're gonna do\na switchport mode trunk, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.220\nSo notice that this side, it actually\ntook it without complaining like hey,\n\n49\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.640\nencapsulation and all that stuff here.\n\n50\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.200\nIt said sure, we can go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.510\ndo that, you don't have to\nreally worry about it, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.260\nBut we're still gonna hard set it, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.690\nBecause I don't want there to be\nany particular questions about this\n\n54\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.236\nif anything fails here.\n\n55\n00:02:55.236 --> 00:03:01.901\nIt's gonna be switchport\ntrunk encap dot1q.\n\n56\n00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.701\nSwitchport, maybe if I can spell it.\n\n57\n00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.416\n&gt;&gt; Switchport, here you go.\n\n58\n00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:11.309\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n59\n00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.561\nlet me see cuz sometimes\nit doesn't have it, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.116\nSo here this done\na little bit differently,\n\n61\n00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:20.679\nthis switch is saying I only accept dot1q.\n\n62\n00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:25.500\nSo notice the encapsulation\ncommand isn't even in there, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300\nSo you will also see that sometimes too.\n\n64\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.380\nSo whereas on 3750 it says no, I'll do the\nencapsulation cuz I know I'll be hooked\n\n65\n00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.790\ninto different other switches that\nmay have it, may not have it.\n\n66\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.190\nThis one though, we'll only do dot1q, so\n\n67\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.700\neven that encapsulation is not set\nup here for what we want to do.\n\n68\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.120\nSo that's fine.\n\n69\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.770\nSo now that we got switch port mode trunk,\nwe are fine.\n\n70\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.560\nLet's verify.\n\n71\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.790\nDo show interface trunk.\n\n72\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.590\nMake sure that everything is good.\n\n73\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.215\nAnd there we go.\n\n74\n00:03:56.215 --> 00:04:02.550\nSo on NYACCESS1, FA24, it is trunking,\nit is doing the dot1q.\n\n75\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.320\nAnd the difference between this time and\n\n76\n00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.710\nwhat we did in the first part of\nthis little mini series here, right?\n\n77\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.610\nIs that we saw that the mode actually said\n\n78\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.030\nauto at the very beginning when\nwe showed you this before.\n\n79\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.370\nThis time it says on, and\nthat is what you are looking for.\n\n80\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.696\nIf both sides say it is on,\n\n81\n00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:24.020\nthat means it's hard-set to do\nwhat we want it to do, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.975\nNow, once we have this,\nI want to now limit this, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:32.866\nWhere is says VLANs allowed on the trunk.\n\n84\n00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:38.679\nI don't have 4094, 4095 trunks here,\n4095 trunks, I want to kind\n\n85\n00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:44.860\nof limit this down to the VLANs that\nare existing, or to the ones that I want.\n\n86\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.573\nNow, in an environment where there\nare many VLANs, you might wonder like,\n\n87\n00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:49.977\nwhy do we want to limit this?\n\n88\n00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:54.201\nIt could where you create multiple\nredundant trunk links between them, and\n\n89\n00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:58.560\nwhat you want to do is you want to\ndistribute the traffic between them.\n\n90\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.090\nYou can say, I want VLANs 10 and\n30 to go across this trunk link.\n\n91\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.580\nI want VLANs 20 and 40 to go\nacross another trunk link instead.\n\n92\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.860\nAnd that way it's not all kind of getting\nbottlenecked in that single trunk.\n\n93\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.810\nSo you can use it for\nyour purposes like that as well.\n\n94\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.350\nAnd also for security purposes.\n\n95\n00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.308\nI shouldn't say security, logging,\nI think is probably the better.\n\n96\n00:05:18.308 --> 00:05:21.523\nSo it makes it easier for you just to see\nthose logs instead of going I gotta do\n\n97\n00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:25.290\nthis, and then I gotta filter it down,\nthen I gotta filter it down here again.\n\n98\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.558\nThat way you can say okay, on this\ninterface, okay, here is all the even\n\n99\n00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:32.003\nnumber of VLANs on this one, then you\ncan start limiting down as you need to.\n\n100\n00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:34.308\nBut that's what we wanna do at this point,\nright?\n\n101\n00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:37.750\nIt's that we want to make sure that\nit's configured this way, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.410\nBut when you verify, make sure that\nthis says on, and not or DTP, or\n\n103\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.240\nwhatever else it might be.\n\n104\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.460\nBoth sides should be set to on.\n\n105\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.870\nSo how do we limit this one to only the\nlinks that we want to do, or the VLANs?\n\n106\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.492\nLet me click here.\n\n107\n00:05:55.977 --> 00:06:02.090\nSwitchport, trunk, and now I saw\nthat keyword there which is allowed.\n\n108\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.910\nSo up here at the top it says allowed,\n\n109\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.820\nset allowed VLAN characteristic when\nthe interface is in trunking mode.\n\n110\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.470\nSo on this one, switchport allowed here.\n\n111\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:20.620\nVLAN, now I have to type in\nthe VLANSs separated by a comma.\n\n112\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.151\nBut here is another important syntax,\n\n113\n00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:29.187\nyou have to do comma, so\nVLAN 10, comma, VLAN 20.\n\n114\n00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:32.931\nNotice that there is no space, okay,\n\n115\n00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:37.617\nin between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 here, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:37.617 --> 00:06:42.376\nYou wanna make sure that there are no\nspaces in between the VLANs, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:46.183\nIf you don't, that, again,\nis a syntax error, and\n\n118\n00:06:46.183 --> 00:06:51.190\nin that syntax error, it's not gonna\nbe forgiven for you on the exam.\n\n119\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.595\nIt's just gonna say,\nyou should know better than this.\n\n120\n00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:55.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the ones that kill you,\n\n121\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.680\nthis one space.\n\n122\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.430\nBut they expect you to\nbe able to see that and\n\n123\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.780\nthe difference when you\ndo something like this.\n\n124\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.470\nSo make sure you realize that that's\nsomething that you will end up seeing\n\n125\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.150\nas a possibility.\n\n126\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.860\nNow, notice it accepts command,\n\n127\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.340\nit doesn't give us any other\ntype of output to worry about.\n\n128\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.170\nNow, let's compare the difference\n\n129\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.308\nthat we see right here when I run the same\n\n130\n00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:25.530\ndo show interface trunk again.\n\n131\n00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.090\nNow, when we compare them, I think I\ncan actually get them both on screen.\n\n132\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.773\nYeah, cool, I can.\n&gt;&gt; Here you go.\n\n133\n00:07:30.773 --> 00:07:31.947\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to make sure.\n\n134\n00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:36.613\nSo here it is, VLANs allowed on\nthat trunk that we just created\n\n135\n00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:39.520\nthere before we did the VLAN allowed.\n\n136\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.308\nAnd now, oops, [LAUGH] that shouldn't\nbe that difficult but darn,\n\n137\n00:07:44.308 --> 00:07:46.073\nit's what it is, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:50.500\nAnd now notice the difference,\none has 4095 VLANs going across it.\n\n139\n00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.212\nThis one has two.\n\n140\n00:07:51.212 --> 00:07:51.871\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n[LAUGH] Dos.\n\n141\n00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.688\n&gt;&gt; So yeah thought,\nit makes it very easy for\n\n142\n00:07:54.688 --> 00:07:59.050\nyou to understand why this is\na good option for you to set.\n\n143\n00:07:59.050 --> 00:07:59.890\nNow, can you allow for that?\n\n144\n00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.180\nYeah, notice that it says that a single\ntrunk can't handle all of this.\n\n145\n00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.972\nBut remember, when you're pushing\na high volume of traffic,\n\n146\n00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:09.470\nit's still gonna end up having bottle\nnecks in terms of speed, right?\n\n147\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.070\nIf it's 100 megabit and you're\nsending 200 megs, you gotta realize,\n\n148\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.220\nit's gonna slow down.\n\n149\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.750\nOkay?\n\n150\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.590\nBut overall, though,\nit shouldn't normally for us,\n\n151\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.270\nit's not gonna actually be that way.\n\n152\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.190\nBut you can kinda get the idea\nthat this is what happens here.\n\n153\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.730\nOkay?\n\n154\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.320\nSo now that we have those\ntrunks configured here and\n\n155\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.905\nthe VLAN is essentially\nlimited in what we need.\n\n156\n00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:32.770\nWe've got everything set\nup the way we want to.\n\n157\n00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.839\nIt is now time to start assigning\nsome ports to those VLANs.\n\n158\n00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:39.650\nNow this is the one where\nVTP doesn't help us.\n\n159\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.585\nOkay?\n\n160\n00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:43.879\nSo I can't go to NYCORE1 and\n\n161\n00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:48.971\nassign on NYACCESS1 a port into that VLAN.\n\n162\n00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:49.850\nOkay?\n\n163\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.030\nSo I have to do this per switch, so this,\n\n164\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.290\nwhen you can't allow VTP to handle for\nyou.\n\n165\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.590\nSo let's go over to\nNYCORE1 if I can find it.\n\n166\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.130\nThere it is.\n\n167\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.455\nNYCORE1.\n\n168\n00:09:06.122 --> 00:09:12.255\nAnd let's assign some ports to VLANs.\n\n169\n00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.250\nAll right.\n\n170\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.240\nSo we're gonna assign the first.\n\n171\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.646\nYeah.\nThe first interface here,\n\n172\n00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:30.377\nInterface fa1/0/1 into vlan 10.\n\n173\n00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:39.610\nSO I need switchport mode access,\nto hard is set as an access port.\n\n174\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.901\nAnd then, switchport Access vlan 10.\n\n175\n00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:52.714\nThen we're gonna do interface fa1/0/2,\n\n176\n00:09:52.714 --> 00:10:00.079\nagain, switchport mode access and\nthen switchport.\n\n177\n00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:04.929\nSwitchporrt, two Rs,\n&gt;&gt; Switchport.\n\n178\n00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:07.360\n&gt;&gt; Access, I know.\n\n179\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.860\nAccess 20.\n\n180\n00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:13.740\nMake sure I'm doing the right ports here,\ndon't wanna get those wrong as well.\n\n181\n00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.810\nOkay?\nSo that should do that for that one.\n\n182\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.300\nWe also want over on NY access now, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.200\nSo just verifying.\n\n184\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.740\nNow, we actually did have\na comment in our chatroom.\n\n185\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.670\nSomebody is probably screaming a little\nbit saying, Ronnie, you've done two\n\n186\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.080\nof these different episodes now and\nyou haven't saved a single time.\n\n187\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.740\n&gt;&gt; No, you haven't.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, so let's do a save here.\n\n188\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:46.275\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] A real world\nof hurt at that point.\n\n189\n00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:50.550\n&gt;&gt; So do copy run start.\n\n190\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:55.736\nNow, that is an abbreviation for\ncopy running-config\n\n191\n00:10:55.736 --> 00:10:59.510\nstartup-config, but\nthat's what it will also.\n\n192\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.940\nIt says it doesn't allow me to do that.\n\n193\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.270\nWell, then I'm lying to you, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.236\nSo apparently,\nI have to actually do it out here.\n\n195\n00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:10.210\nSo copy running-config startup-config.\n\n196\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.330\nSo I wasn't expecting that.\n\n197\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.680\nUsually it allows you to do\nit anywhere that you want to.\n\n198\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.880\nBut on that one, it says nope,\nI will not allow you to do that so.\n\n199\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.210\n&gt;&gt; Fine, be that way.\n\n200\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.588\n&gt;&gt; I hopefully have now relieved at least\none person's mind and at least Daniel,\n\n201\n00:11:22.588 --> 00:11:25.786\ncuz Daniel was just saying\nthat in between break as well.\n\n202\n00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:26.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n203\n00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:29.480\n&gt;&gt; He's like yeah, I used to do this\nbetween every other command that I add.\n\n204\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, every command.\n\n205\n00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:31.320\n&gt;&gt; So I understand.\n\n206\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.700\nEvery command.\n&gt;&gt; It becomes ingrained in your brain.\n\n207\n00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.550\nCopy run start, copy run start,\ncopy run start.\n\n208\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.060\nDo a command, copy run start.\n\n209\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.320\nThat way, whatever happens,\nyou never know.\n\n210\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.460\nYou can't predict the future.\n\n211\n00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.819\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\nDon't lose those,\n\n212\n00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:44.840\nthose valuable commands you've input.\n\n213\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit is amazing how fast you can lose them.\n\n214\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.920\n&gt;&gt; It really is, yeah.\n\n215\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.825\n&gt;&gt; It kind of startles you at times.\n\n216\n00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:51.100\nRight?\n\n217\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.900\nSo this one I want interface, fa,\nshort for fast [INAUDIBLE] 0/23.\n\n218\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.420\nAnd this one is gonna be for vlan 10.\n\n219\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.760\nA switchport mode access.\n\n220\n00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.100\nAnd then switchport access vlan 10.\n\n221\n00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:16.470\nAnd for us here, interface fa0/20.\n\n222\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:22.570\nActually this is 0/1.\n\n223\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.380\nSo at least, yeah, okay,\njust wanna make sure.\n\n224\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.235\n1, not the tick mark there.\n\n225\n00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:32.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So back tick interface fa 0/1,\n\n226\n00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:39.725\nswitchport mode access,\nswitchport access vlan 20, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:42.453\nNow if you're watching, right?\n\n228\n00:12:42.453 --> 00:12:47.068\nAnd you're saying, dang, Ronnie,\nthat's a lot of typo errors, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:49.430\nYou're absolutely right.\n\n230\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.110\nMy typing skills are not exactly the best.\n\n231\n00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.630\nBut on a real switch, the nice thing\nis you have those shortcuts, right?\n\n232\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.750\nUsually on something like this, I would\njust be hitting the up arrow, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.500\nAfter configuring and\nit will automatically type it in for\n\n234\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.200\nme and I just go in and\nchange the parts that I need to.\n\n235\n00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.610\nAnd it's a lot faster when you do that.\n\n236\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.505\nBut for what we're doing here, right?\n\n237\n00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:15.297\nIt's gonna make me manually type\nin every single one that I can is\n\n238\n00:13:15.297 --> 00:13:17.090\nwhat it's going to do.\n\n239\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.478\nAll right, so now that we've got\neverything configured the way that we\n\n240\n00:13:21.478 --> 00:13:26.160\nare expecting, we're gonna move to\na different device which is a router and\n\n241\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.050\nwe are going to begin to verify that.\n\n242\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.845\nThe VLANs are created in the way that\nwe want to, so let's go to NYEDGE1 and\n\n243\n00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:39.690\nit brought me to NYCORE\nwhich kinda frightens me.\n\n244\n00:13:43.206 --> 00:13:45.787\nAll right, NYEDGE1.\n\n245\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.620\nThere we go,\nstarting to get somewhere, maybe.\n\n246\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.240\nAll right.\nSo apparently I can not get access to\n\n247\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.380\nthe router that I'm supposed\nto be able to ping from.\n\n248\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.544\nI don't know why, I'm clicking on,\nI'm seeing that it's changing but\n\n249\n00:14:02.544 --> 00:14:03.880\nit's not allowing me access.\n\n250\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.620\nBut I did pull up this lab machine here\nand when I pull it at this lab machine,\n\n251\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.930\nI can at least begin to ping and\nsee what's on different ones here.\n\n252\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.150\nOkay?\nSo what should be on this same one?\n\n253\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.980\nI don't even know.\n\n254\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.070\nI just pulled it up as an emergency here.\n\n255\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.039\nSo if I just start pinging\nsome of the devices here, so\n\n256\n00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:27.350\n192.168.16.2, well,\nthis lab machine is 16.10.\n\n257\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:33.160\nSo I know that this is in whatever same\nVLAN that I just pinged on that port.\n\n258\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.982\nBut if I try and ping 192.168,\n\n259\n00:14:37.982 --> 00:14:43.718\nif I can do it, 192.168.16.4,\n\n260\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.598\nThat one is not going across,\nso we're now seeing that hey,\n\n261\n00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:54.149\nthe VLANs are actually working\nsuccessfully whereas this particular port\n\n262\n00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:59.220\nwas actually be able to ping at least\nthat device that was in that same VLAN.\n\n263\n00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.660\nBut the other site,\nI can't actually ping from,\n\n264\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.040\ncuz I don't have access to any\nother device at that point.\n\n265\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.790\nSo we are verifying that everything\nis working at this point.\n\n266\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.060\nThe VLANs are working, they are separated.\n\n267\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.260\nWe'd still need to implement a router\nin between if we wanna do that.\n\n268\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.952\nBut normally that goes into, of course,\nour CCNA routing and switching.\n\n269\n00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:22.210\nWe'll not be doing that in\nthis particular show so much.\n\n270\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.080\nWe'll be dealing with that\nmore at that point, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.440\nSo Daniel, that leaves us really with\none particular concept that we have left\n\n272\n00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.010\nwhich is we need to configure\nthis idea of the native VLAN.\n\n273\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.370\nNow the great thing is we've\nalready done this one time on\n\n274\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.180\nour switch when we configured\na single switch here.\n\n275\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:47.430\nSo let's do the same thing,\nshow vlan brief.\n\n276\n00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.680\nMake sure that we understand\nwhat's going on here, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.613\nSo these two ports right here, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:52.613 --> 00:15:56.282\nThey are actually gonna be\nin that management VLAN, so\n\n279\n00:15:56.282 --> 00:15:59.632\nmore than likely what\nI did is that fa1/0/1,\n\n280\n00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:04.737\nthat is probably connected to that\nThis PLAB here, and more than likely this\n\n281\n00:16:04.737 --> 00:16:10.207\nparticular practice switch is also right\nthere in that management VLAN as well.\n\n282\n00:16:10.207 --> 00:16:14.251\nAnd then whatever other device .2 was,\nwhich is NYCORE2,\n\n283\n00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:18.550\nif I remember right, is in the other\nV LAN, so it is working here.\n\n284\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.200\nBut let's do this idea of the native VLAN.\n\n285\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.739\nRemember that on a single switch, right?\n\n286\n00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:27.730\nThe native VLAN is going to be well,\n1, on every single switch.\n\n287\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.370\nBut now that I have multiple switches I\nwant the native VLAN to change, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.360\nAnd so I need to go ahead and\nconfigure that.\n\n289\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.270\nAnd that is gonna be the VLAN which all\nof the traffic that doesn't have any tag\n\n290\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.980\ntraffic on it, cuz we're using 802.1q,\n\n291\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.420\nthat's the one that actually\nimplements tagging.\n\n292\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.590\nISL doesn't have any tagging, that means\nwe're gonna create another VLAN right\n\n293\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.740\nhere on this one because this is what?\n\n294\n00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.550\nOur VTP server as well.\n\n295\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.350\nSo let's go to our global config.\n\n296\n00:16:56.353 --> 00:16:59.609\nAnd once we're actually\ninside global configuration,\n\n297\n00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:04.730\nlet's do the same thing that we did\nwhich is, let's do vlan 999 here.\n\n298\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.910\nAnd we'll name this one, and this is\none we'll call NATIVE at this point.\n\n299\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.580\nNow there's 50-50 chance that\nthis is going to show up.\n\n300\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why it doesn't.\n\n301\n00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.548\n&gt;&gt; Care to take any bets right know?\n\n302\n00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:17.920\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, no, I really don't.\n\n303\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.099\n&gt;&gt; I'll give you 3 to 1 odds on it.\n\n304\n00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.345\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think 3 to 1 would be high at times\n\n305\n00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:23.999\nhere, fire this up.\n\n306\n00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:25.460\n&gt;&gt; It's not there.\n\n307\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.700\n&gt;&gt; It didn't actually show up, but\nif I do it again, it loves it.\n\n308\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:35.675\nvlan 999 and then name, and then we'll\ncall this one Native just again here.\n\n309\n00:17:35.675 --> 00:17:36.618\nAnd so, yeah,\n\n310\n00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:41.490\nI think that there is something going\nsquirrelly with this particular switch.\n\n311\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.593\nThis time, there it is.\n\n312\n00:17:46.593 --> 00:17:48.670\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it finally actually is where\n\n313\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.050\nwe want it to be here, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.510\nSo once we have that particular VLAN,\nokay?\n\n315\n00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.630\nUp here, we also want to do something\nthat's a little bit more unusual, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:04.150\nWe want to go ahead and\nshut down this VLAN as well, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.050\nSo if I do vlan 999,\n\n318\n00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:12.470\nI can issue a shutdown command too,\nand notice it accepts it.\n\n319\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.430\nAnd that essentially parks it out there,\nso let's do show\n\n320\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.390\nvlan brief, and I did not do\nthat on the single switch here.\n\n321\n00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.710\nBut you should see, Native VLAN, okay, so\nit's actually still there, so we are fine.\n\n322\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.600\nSo this means that you won't really have\naccess into it, is what you won't have.\n\n323\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.760\nSo then we can start putting ports\ninto this particular VLAN again.\n\n324\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.008\nWe're gonna use our interface range here,\nfa 1/0/3, and\n\n325\n00:18:42.008 --> 00:18:47.039\nnow I just need to see what numbers\nare missing, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n\n326\n00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:51.785\n10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\nlet's do all the way through 24.\n\n327\n00:18:54.104 --> 00:18:57.400\nThrough, space dash space, 24.\n\n328\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.432\nAnd now switchport,\n\n329\n00:19:05.982 --> 00:19:10.970\nTrunk here, native vlan 999.\n\n330\n00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:16.971\nAnd that will now put all of\nthem into that Native VLAN, and\n\n331\n00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:21.598\nnow that we've shut it down it means that\nsomebody can't even do that idea of VLAN\n\n332\n00:19:21.598 --> 00:19:23.320\nhopping back to Native VLAN.\n\n333\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.920\nEven if it did, it's shut down, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.770\nSo they should not be able\nto get access into it.\n\n335\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.875\nThe other thing I like doing here as well\nis just shutting down those ports here.\n\n336\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.320\nSo even if somebody were to plug in,\nthose ports would now be shut down.\n\n337\n00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.090\nSo now it's turning them off\nadministratively, one at a time.\n\n338\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.130\nAnd, of course, yeah,\nwhy didn't it actually put them in there?\n\n339\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.129\nGo figure, okay?.\n\n340\n00:19:53.129 --> 00:19:54.199\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's funny, do it again,\ntry it one more time, right?\n\n341\n00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:59.887\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it is just amazing here, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:04.153\ninterface range fa1/0/3, space, 24.\n\n343\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:13.570\nAt least that's what I have,\nswitchport trunk native, negative.\n\n344\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.539\n&gt;&gt; Negative.\n[LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:18.145\n&gt;&gt; native vlan 999.\n\n346\n00:20:20.835 --> 00:20:22.726\nAll right?\n\n347\n00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:27.130\nIt might actually be yeah,\nI could also just put them in there.\n\n348\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.670\nLet's do it the old fashioned way too,\nswitchport,\n\n349\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.140\nnow that would actually make\nan access port so I can't do that.\n\n350\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.420\nSo I'm now limiting the Native VLAN for\n\n351\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.750\nall of these to that trunk, so\nI was reading it backward, right?\n\n352\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.671\nAll these are gonna be access ports\nhere so I didn't even need to do that.\n\n353\n00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:45.152\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I needed to do that one,\n\n354\n00:20:45.152 --> 00:20:46.623\nI'm just being silly here.\n\n355\n00:20:46.623 --> 00:20:48.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is my fault.\n\n356\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.620\nI was trying to do it\nlike the other one here,\n\n357\n00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.200\nI was trying to make sure that\nNative VLAN only went across one trunk.\n\n358\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; That was me,\n\n359\n00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.180\nthat's my fault completely.\n\n360\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:04.000\nSo this should be interface, I was looking\ndown in the wrong place, fa1/0/22.\n\n361\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.027\nThen I want the switchport trunk\nto only hold the native vlan,\n\n362\n00:21:09.027 --> 00:21:11.450\nthat is my fault completely.\n\n363\n00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.560\nI don't know why my brain just went\nsomewhere else on that one, so\n\n364\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.819\nthis is, I was trying to think of\nparking lot VLAN and Native VLAN and\n\n365\n00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:23.890\nall that kind of junked in my mind\nhere in doing what we wanted to.\n\n366\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:30.668\nNow do show interface trunk.\n\n367\n00:21:34.723 --> 00:21:40.770\nMaybe [LAUGH] all right, that is awesome.\n\n368\n00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:49.702\nShow interface trunk.\n\n369\n00:21:51.275 --> 00:21:55.360\nDid I just remove the trunk,\nthat's what I did.\n\n370\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.129\nI'm now getting trunk here.\n\n371\n00:22:01.129 --> 00:22:03.079\nWhat?\n\n372\n00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:06.996\nLet's see, hm.\n\n373\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.750\nYou're gonna make me, so\nthat is the command, but\n\n374\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:20.520\nlooks like I've turned off\ntrunking on this thing, go figure.\n\n375\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.500\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n376\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthis is not what I was expecting.\n\n377\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.970\nLet's check on the other side here,\ncuz I was not expecting that.\n\n378\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.282\nAll right, so Daniel, I did figure\nout what I had done wrong, right?\n\n379\n00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:31.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; When I told you the way that I was\n\n380\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.150\ngonna put everything into one VLAN,\nI also issued a shutdown command.\n\n381\n00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.800\nSo that's why that show interface\ntrunk wasn't working, okay?\n\n382\n00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.790\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was shut down?\n\n383\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.721\n&gt;&gt; Because it was shut down,\nso it's not gonna trunk, okay?\n\n384\n00:22:42.721 --> 00:22:43.640\n&gt;&gt; Gets you every time.\n\n385\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now if I go back in and\nI issue a no shutdown,\n\n386\n00:22:50.132 --> 00:22:52.936\nHere at least I think if I issue\na no shutdown, there we go.\n\n387\n00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:53.813\n&gt;&gt; Something happened.\n\n388\n00:22:53.813 --> 00:22:57.362\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something is gonna happen,\nthat's the interface that we put that said\n\n389\n00:22:57.362 --> 00:23:01.560\nNative VLAN is gonna be on this particular\ntrunk here and that's perfectly fine.\n\n390\n00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:08.715\nSo now if I type in do show interface\ntrunk, that's what I was hoping to do.\n\n391\n00:23:08.715 --> 00:23:11.770\n[LAUGH] There we go,\nit was just me turning it off.\n\n392\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.720\nSo this allows us now and\nyou see where now it's reporting, hey,\n\n394\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.985\non this particular trunk,\nas stuff goes in the native vlan is\n\n395\n00:23:20.985 --> 00:23:24.660\ngonna be on port 999 instead, okay?\n\n396\n00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.560\nSo the great thing is over on this\nside as we start doing this, right?\n\n397\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.891\nYou'll end up seeing stuff like that\ngo through, a lot of times, and\n\n398\n00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:35.080\nyou may have to wait for it though.\n\n399\n00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.920\nEvery once in a while like on\nthe other end of that connection\n\n400\n00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.510\nyou'll also end up seeing, especially\nif the VLAN is not the same number,\n\n401\n00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.710\nwhich I don't believe that this one is.\n\n402\n00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.210\nLet me see where we are here,\nshow interface\n\n403\n00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.720\ntrunk, but it may take a little\nbit of time before it does it.\n\n404\n00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.500\nYou may also end up seeing syslog\nmessages that will tell you that there's\n\n405\n00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.360\na Native VLAN mismatch, okay?\n\n406\n00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.960\nAnd it will just complain, it will start\ncomplaining after a while, as more traffic\n\n407\n00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.860\ngoes through it'll start complaining,\nsaying you need these things to match up.\n\n408\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.970\nAnd that's because it can't, doesn't know\nwhere to send untagged traffic, right?\n\n409\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:16.770\nSo if it comes in, or\nas it leaves this port overall,\n\n410\n00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.830\nit says untagged traffic goes on VLAN1.\n\n411\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.730\nWell when it arrives at NYCORE1,\nwell, what does that say?\n\n412\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.710\nIt's saying well, I see Native VLAN\nis supposed to be 999 and\n\n413\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.290\nyou're saying that yours is 1,\nI don't accept that.\n\n414\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:35.770\nSo if you have untagged traffic,\nthat's where it's going to matter.\n\n415\n00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.770\nSo this way you change it up and\n\n416\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.570\nyou know, you dont have to worry about it,\nit allows you to do that.\n\n417\n00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.350\nSo before I was thinking of just creating\nthat default parking lot VLAN, and\n\n418\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.860\nI don't know why that slipped into my\nmind, like I said, but it just did.\n\n419\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.480\nAgain, we're changing the Native VLAN\non the trunk, so this\n\n420\n00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.090\nis the VLAN essentially, the VLAN number,\nthat untagged traffic will go across.\n\n421\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.930\nSo if you are gonna be configuring\nmultiple switches, ideally between those\n\n422\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.250\nswitches you also have the same Native\nVLAN between those switches as well.\n\n423\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.620\nSo Daniel, that's pretty much everything\nthat I needed to show you here.\n\n424\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.783\nWith that unusual, I say unusual, that\nmistake by me of just mistaking that one\n\n425\n00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:19.350\nentire concept for another one, you know,\nI mean go figure, who else would do that?\n\n426\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.462\nBut, we've already talked\nabout the other one and\n\n427\n00:25:21.462 --> 00:25:23.570\nthat's what slipped into my mind here.\n\n428\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:27.314\nSo overall though Daniel, we actually see\nthat there's a lot of configuration right\n\n429\n00:25:27.314 --> 00:25:30.128\nhere for you to go through, so\nmake sure to take the time to do it.\n\n430\n00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:33.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but VTP,\ntotally worth the effort to get it into,\n\n431\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.880\nlearn how it works, because it's\ngoing to save you a lot of time and\n\n432\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.120\nfrustration if you figure out this is\nexactly how I can configure all my\n\n433\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.414\nswitches to make sure they're running and\ndon't forget the trunking.\n\n434\n00:25:42.414 --> 00:25:44.979\nIt's a wonderful thing, so\nRonnie we do thank you for\n\n435\n00:25:44.979 --> 00:25:48.517\nshowing us how we can make that happen,\neven though you had a little gaff.\n\n436\n00:25:48.517 --> 00:25:49.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not a big deal,\n\n437\n00:25:49.528 --> 00:25:50.905\nwe forgive around here Ronnie,\n\n438\n00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:52.316\nit's not a huge problem,\n&gt;&gt; That's who I am.\n\n439\n00:25:52.316 --> 00:25:53.616\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n440\n00:25:53.616 --> 00:25:54.939\nwe accept you man that's right.\n\n441\n00:25:54.939 --> 00:25:55.701\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n442\n00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:57.294\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie thanks again for dropping by,\n\n443\n00:25:57.294 --> 00:25:58.600\nalways appreciate your time.\n\n444\n00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.930\nAnd we appreciate you good\nfolks out there as well, but\n\n445\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.170\nwe are out of time when it\ncomes to this show anyway.\n\n446\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.551\nBut don't worry, we got plenty more in\nthe series to come, but as for this day we\n\n447\n00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:09.500\nare gonna sign off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n448\n00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.329\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong,\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n449\n00:26:12.329 -->

Thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:29.930\nhaving me on the show, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.116\nAs we continue on in our CCENT journey\ntogether and learning more about it.\n\n12\n00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:39.017\nToday we are focusing in on some\nadditional layer 2 protocols that we need\n\n13\n00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:42.360\nto know about,\nas we prepare for that exam.\n\n14\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.543\nSo today, we're gonna be taking a look at\nsome that really help in the management\n\n15\n00:00:46.543 --> 00:00:49.569\nof, well, for us,\nswitches is what we're going to see.\n\n16\n00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:50.332\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n17\n00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:51.755\nwhat are layer two protocols?\n\n18\n00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:52.403\nWhat are they?\nAnd\n\n19\n00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:55.709\nwhat do they do?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, when it comes down to it, for\n\n20\n00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:59.396\nus, the layer 2 protocols that we're\nspecifically gonna be addressing\n\n21\n00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:01.783\nare gonna be what we\ncall discovery protocols.\n\n22\n00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:06.530\nThe idea of discovery protocols, they work\nat layer 2 of the OSI model, which means,\n\n23\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.720\nof course,\nthe data-link layer of the OSI model.\n\n24\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.446\nThey allow us to discover devices\nthat are directly connected.\n\n25\n00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:16.950\nAnd so\nthese are very important protocols for us,\n\n26\n00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.210\nbecause of all that they\nreally allow us to do.\n\n27\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.571\nThat allowance of discovery really\nhelps out when you are faced with\n\n28\n00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:29.251\na situation in which you cannot clearly\nlay out a nice diagram of things.\n\n29\n00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:33.850\nAnd all the sudden, you're still having to\ndiscover what device is connected to what.\n\n30\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.540\nSo sometimes you will get instances where\nyou'll see kind of a mess of things,\n\n31\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.316\nlike a bird's nest of different devices\nthat are all stacked nicely together.\n\n32\n00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:48.040\nBut so many additional wires that\nare out there, that it becomes much more\n\n33\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.350\ndifficult to be able to figure out\nexactly what device is plugged into what.\n\n34\n00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.784\nThis type of protocol is really going\nto help us to figure that out as well.\n\n35\n00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.624\nSo that's why we're jumping into this.\n\n36\n00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:03.528\nNow, when we start to talk about this,\nthis is part of the exam objectives and\n\n37\n00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:07.250\nunderstanding this, and we wanna\nshow you all that we can about it.\n\n38\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.835\nBut there is no official labs\nin the practice labs guides for\n\n39\n00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:12.277\nus to be able to do this.\n\n40\n00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.997\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine, and\n\n41\n00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:17.340\nthis will kind of help us out.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n42\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.181\n&gt;&gt; Now, over here on the left hand side,\n\n43\n00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.601\nif you open up of course\nyour practicelabs.com,\n\n44\n00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.457\nyou can chose any lab that you want to.\n\n45\n00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:26.528\nAnd here's the diagram that you're\ngiven for every single lab.\n\n46\n00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:28.612\nAnd all you're doing is you're\nconfiguring different devices.\n\n47\n00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:31.410\nYou get through all the scenarios\nthat they're putting you through.\n\n48\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.755\nBut notice how nicely it's laid out.\n\n49\n00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:38.115\nEverything is actually directly connected\ntoo, and you see all the labeling,\n\n50\n00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:41.560\nall the diagrams and\nall that stuff when you see that.\n\n51\n00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.829\nBut in reality it's not that there's\na room somewhere on this planet in which\n\n52\n00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.099\nevery device is actually laid out like\nin this triangular pattern that you see\n\n53\n00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.835\nright here.\n\n54\n00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:53.715\nAnd a straight cable going\nto a Cisco IP phone, and\n\n55\n00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.810\nanother cable laid out where\nthere's a router here.\n\n56\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.025\nAnd then another one laid out over here,\nand then a frame relay switch.\n\n57\n00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:03.200\nAnd it's not laid out that way.\n\n58\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.183\nIn all reality, Zach, all these are\nprobably mounted inside of a rack that you\n\n59\n00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:11.519\nhave, and\nthey're stacked one on top of the other.\n\n60\n00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.824\nAnd that cabling that you're\nseeing here that's so nicely,\n\n61\n00:03:15.824 --> 00:03:20.636\nlogically laid out for us is not in\nthat existence, in that pattern.\n\n62\n00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:23.544\nSo even though physically,\nit doesn't look like this,\n\n63\n00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:25.800\nthis is how logically it lays out.\n\n64\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.893\nWhen you get hired as\na Cisco professional,\n\n65\n00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:34.424\nthere is gonna be sometimes you inherit\nthis network of devices that you have.\n\n66\n00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:38.710\nAnd now you're asked to make heads or\ntails of this.\n\n67\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.337\nWell, the only way that you normally can\nactually make a nice logical diagram is if\n\n68\n00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:46.099\nyou had put it together yourself,\nvery easily.\n\n69\n00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.377\nBut now you see wires\nupon wires upon wires.\n\n70\n00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:52.796\nAnd you're not exactly sure\nwhat is connected to what.\n\n71\n00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:57.230\nAnd this way what we can do is we\ncan use something that we call\n\n72\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.110\nCisco Discovery Protocol, or\nCDP as it's more commonly known,\n\n73\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.812\nto allow us to do this.\n\n74\n00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:08.370\nNow the great thing about this\nis that on Cisco devices they\n\n75\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.010\nare normally turned on already.\n\n76\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.434\nSo Cisco has their own\nproprietary discovery protocol,\n\n77\n00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.938\ncalled CDP, Cisco Discovery Protocol.\n\n78\n00:04:16.938 --> 00:04:20.200\nAnd just about on every device,\nwhether it's a router or a switch,\n\n79\n00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.196\nit is turned on, and it is communicating.\n&gt;&gt; But that only works on Cisco equipment.\n\n80\n00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.479\nIs that right, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n81\n00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:25.979\nis.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n82\n00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.704\n&gt;&gt; It's only Cisco\n\n83\n00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:28.000\nproprietary at this point.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n84\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.924\n&gt;&gt; So that means if you don't have\n\n85\n00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:31.330\nall Cisco equipment,\n\n86\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.782\nsome devices will not respond.\nAnd\n\n87\n00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:36.624\nwe'll address that in a few moments here.\nBut at the beginning,\n\n88\n00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:40.767\nsince we're dealing with the idea of Cisco\nequipment, we'll stick with that idea for\n\n89\n00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:41.540\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n90\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.973\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:47.162\ntake a look just by default here.\nThe key to remember, as far as getting\n\n92\n00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:51.249\nready for the exam as well, is that this\nparticular protocol works on layer 2.\n\n93\n00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.913\nNow it's gonna be funny, cuz we're gonna\n\n94\n00:04:53.913 --> 00:04:57.837\nsee some layer 3 information which\nkind of violates the rule of\n\n95\n00:04:57.837 --> 00:05:01.458\nseparation that we do in the OSI model.\nBut it is in there,\n\n96\n00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:04.149\nit allows us to see a lot.\nSo let's take this for example.\n\n97\n00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:06.878\nNow Zach, I briefly showed you a flash on\n\n98\n00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:11.412\nmy screen of the diagram that's laid out.\nNow, just now Zach, do you have\n\n99\n00:05:11.412 --> 00:05:15.931\nthe memory of how everything is laid out?\nSo if I were to say this, Zach, right now,\n\n100\n00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:19.918\nwhat devices are connected to NYCORE1?\nJust from your memory of that diagram,\n\n101\n00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:22.372\nwhat are your chances of\nactually recalling those devices\n\n102\n00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:24.522\nthat are connected?\n&gt;&gt; I would say slim to\n\n103\n00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:25.317\nnone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n104\n00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:27.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, slim to none, right?\n\n105\n00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:28.651\nAnd I would say the same thing.\n\n106\n00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:29.839\nEven though I've looked at that\n\n107\n00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.176\ndiagram and I know some of\nthe devices that are connected to it.\n\n108\n00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:33.988\nBut my memory is not that great\n\n109\n00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:34.779\neither.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n110\n00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.802\n&gt;&gt; So the great thing is those devices\n\n111\n00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:41.900\nare Cisco devices.\nAnd unless somebody has turned it off from\n\n112\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.365\nthe default then we should be\nable to discover quickly what\n\n113\n00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:53.080\ndevices are directly connected to NYCORE1.\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n114\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.992\nshow how you can do this.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n115\n00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:56.580\n&gt;&gt; So right here in the NYCORE1,\n\n116\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.278\nI've selected that over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n117\n00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:01.359\nThat brought me to this router.\n\n118\n00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:04.246\nI'm going to get access in, I have to type\n\n119\n00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:08.589\nin their little typing box here.\nGet access after the user mode here and\n\n120\n00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:13.063\nto the privilege exec mode.\nFrom this point I can use a show command.\n\n121\n00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:14.832\nLet me type in show cdp and\n\n122\n00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:19.212\nthen a question mark so\nthat we can see some of the things that we\n\n123\n00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.685\nactually want to explore here.\nAnd\n\n124\n00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:24.750\nwe're not gonna explore too\nmany commands at this point.\n\n125\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.160\nBut for us, you have CDP entry,\ninformation for a specific neighbor entry.\n\n126\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.542\nSo if I know of a specific device,\nI can do that.\n\n127\n00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:37.965\nNow the great thing about CDP, though,\nis that it works very well as long\n\n128\n00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:41.920\nas there's a couple of\nprerequisites that are made.\n\n129\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.262\nOne, of course, is the ports that you\nare connecting to from this device.\n\n130\n00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:47.730\nThey have to be on.\n\n131\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.443\nSo if that port is turned off,\nit's not gonna send back information.\n\n132\n00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:52.486\nSo it has to be on.\n\n133\n00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:54.431\nSo that's one of prerequisites.\n\n134\n00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:59.227\nThe other one that helps to identify\nthese devices incredibly well is that you\n\n135\n00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:02.280\nneed to assign a host\nname to every device.\n\n136\n00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.473\nIn other words, give it a name that you\ncan identify is pretty much the key.\n\n137\n00:07:05.473 --> 00:07:08.408\nAnd we do that using\nthat host name command.\n\n138\n00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:12.070\nSo on every device inside your network,\nmake sure that there's a host name.\n\n139\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.189\nYou do not want the generic name that's\nthere, because even though it will work,\n\n140\n00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.785\nit would be a lot harder to discover\nwhat devices you are connected too.\n\n141\n00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:23.428\nThe great thing is, in our network\ntopology and our diagram that we\n\n142\n00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:27.348\nshowed you, all the devices already\nhave a host name assigned to them.\n\n143\n00:07:27.348 --> 00:07:29.189\nThe other thing that you can also do here.\n\n144\n00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:32.512\nSo when you start seeing it,\nis notice as I showed CDP and\n\n145\n00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:34.440\nthen I typed in interface here.\n\n146\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.363\nIt says, show me the interface status and\nthe configuration.\n\n147\n00:07:38.363 --> 00:07:41.496\nThere's something else that\nwe can do with CDP as well.\n\n148\n00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:45.700\nBy default it's enabled for\nevery single port.\n\n149\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.508\nSo that means that any device that\nconnects to this switch on any one\n\n150\n00:07:49.508 --> 00:07:51.552\nof the ports that's on the switch.\n\n151\n00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:55.431\nCDP will work with it as long as\nthe other side is also working with it.\n\n152\n00:07:55.431 --> 00:08:02.320\nSo it's not limited, but can I turn off,\nCDP firm, the global switch.\n\n153\n00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.695\nIn other words, every port and\njust enable it on the port that I want to,\n\n154\n00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:06.820\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n155\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.290\n&gt;&gt; So I can actually limit\n\n156\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.160\nwhat I want to go out of it\nif I want to as well, okay.\n\n157\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.760\nBut the one that we're gonna\nspend time on right now\n\n158\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.420\nis really this third one here\nwhich is show CDP neighbors.\n\n159\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.529\nSo if I can go in and type show cdp\nneighbors, and you don't really have\n\n160\n00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:27.560\nto type out the whole thing as long\nas it's enough to be unambiguous.\n\n161\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.430\nBut let's go ahead and type out\nthe whole thing for a good measure here.\n\n162\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.680\nWhen I press Return here,\nif CDP is enabled on all of the devices.\n\n163\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.320\nLet me go ahead and\nzoom in just a little bit more here.\n\n164\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.860\nThen we can see this,\nI don't want to get too far in.\n\n165\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.300\nLet me see if I can zoom up a little bit\nso that we can see the whole thing, okay.\n\n166\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.560\nSo now if you look at the screen down here\nat the bottom, you see the information.\n\n167\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.400\nIt say, Global CDP information and\n\n168\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.470\nthat means on the entire switch it is\nsending CDP packets every 60 seconds.\n\n169\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.950\nSo it is communicating with other devices\nthat are also using CDP every minute.\n\n170\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.850\nNotice there's also a sending hold\ntime value of 180 seconds, okay.\n\n171\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.820\nNow this idea of the 180 time\nhold seconds, what is that about?\n\n172\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.630\nIf it doesn't hear from a neighbor,\nokay, in 180 seconds,\n\n173\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.780\nit will drop that connection thinking\nthat, hey, that connection is gone, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.280\nBut it will actually wait 180 seconds,\n\n175\n00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.230\njust in case Zach rebooted that router or\nrebooted that switch.\n\n176\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.410\nIt says, eh, it'll come up here.\n\n177\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.360\nAnd it'll actually keep that information\ndown here at the bottom, for 180 seconds.\n\n178\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.195\nEvery 60 seconds it's communicating, but\nif it doesn't hear from a neighbor in that\n\n179\n00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:49.360\n180 seconds, then it will kind of get rid\nof it and then try and discover it again.\n\n180\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.917\nIt's also sending CDP version two\nadvertisements, so what we are getting is,\n\n181\n00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:56.260\nof course, CDP advertisements.\n\n182\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.330\nIt's essentially advertising\ninformation back to this router.\n\n183\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.530\nAnd so\nwhat kind of information is showing?\n\n184\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.190\nLet's take a look down here at the bottom.\n\n185\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.260\nLet me see if I can scroll up\nhere to help that out, right.\n\n186\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.280\nSo yeah,\nnow we can actually see a little bit more.\n\n187\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.750\nI wanna try and leave those capability\ncodes so that we can see this.\n\n188\n00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.440\nNotice over here, Zach,\non the left-hand side.\n\n189\n00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n190\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.790\nI have the device ID.\n\n191\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.440\nNow that device ID,\nwhat if I don't set up a host name?\n\n192\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.230\nIf I do not set up a host name,\nyou'll end up seeing that it would just\n\n193\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.780\ncopy that platform information\nover here to device ID.\n\n194\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.630\nAnd that now becomes confusing\nbecause I notice something,\n\n195\n00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.200\nZack.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n196\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.900\n&gt;&gt; At least in my list,\n\n197\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.008\nI've got a couple of WSC3750V here, okay.\n\n198\n00:10:40.008 --> 00:10:42.369\nWell if two of those show\nup in a row over hear,\n\n199\n00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:46.370\nI might be in problem of actually\ntrying to identify which one is which.\n\n200\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:51.080\nSo it is always better if by default\nwhen you configure all your devices or\n\n201\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.320\nyou want them verified\nas you're using CDP,\n\n202\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.170\nthat every device has a host name.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n203\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.710\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that will make sure.\n\n204\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.580\nThe other thing that you can also\nsee is on your own switch, so for\n\n205\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.570\nus on NYCORE1,\nthat you see what port is connected here.\n\n206\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:11.294\nSo on NYCORE1, on fast ethernet 1/0/22,\n\n207\n00:11:11.294 --> 00:11:14.715\nit is connected to NYACCESS.\n\n208\n00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:18.280\nNow where is it connected to on NYACCESS?\n\n209\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.485\nIf I go all the way over to the right\nhand side, I can see on NYACEESS1,\n\n210\n00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:27.378\nI'm connected to fast ethernet 0/24.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n211\n00:11:27.378 --> 00:11:29.273\n&gt;&gt; So it actually shows me not only this\n\n212\n00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:34.620\nside's connection, okay, on what port I'm\nconnected to, but also on the other side.\n\n213\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.895\nSo I can now take a piece of paper and\nI can draw a core switch like this, okay.\n\n214\n00:11:39.895 --> 00:11:44.383\nThen I can put on one side of it FA,\non NYCORE1,\n\n215\n00:11:44.383 --> 00:11:49.547\nFA 1/0/22,\ndraw a line to another rectangle and\n\n216\n00:11:49.547 --> 00:11:55.633\nput in NYACCESS1, and\non the other end label it as FA 0/24.\n\n217\n00:11:55.633 --> 00:11:59.837\nAnd now I have the beginning of that\ntopology, just like we were looking at,\n\n218\n00:11:59.837 --> 00:12:02.860\nthat will allow me to\nstart laying this out.\n\n219\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.010\nThen I can go to the second line here and\ndo the same thing, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:11.007\nNow the other things that it shows us,\nokay, as well is remember that I told you\n\n221\n00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:15.369\nthat it's repeating, for 60 seconds we're\ngetting updates every 60 seconds on\n\n222\n00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:17.420\nthe advertisement.\n&gt;&gt; Up to 180.\n\n223\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, up to 180.\n\n224\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.856\nThe whole time right now for NYACCESS1,\n\n225\n00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:25.639\nsince the last time I ran it it says,\nhey look, it's at 130 seconds.\n\n226\n00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:29.140\nSo that means it's began its count down,\nit hasn't received anything.\n\n227\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.240\nSo if it gets all the way down to\na certain point, it's gonna do that.\n\n228\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.480\nBut it's gonna get to that 120, it's\ngonna get a refreshment coming back and\n\n229\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.230\nwe'll see that.\n\n230\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.590\nSo let me see, let me do this.\n\n231\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:44.759\nLet me do the show cdc neighbors again,\nif I can spell it correctly.\n\n232\n00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:48.068\nAnd now you'll see how\nthe whole time started again?\n\n233\n00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:48.811\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n234\n00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:50.755\n&gt;&gt; So you'll see where it says,\n\n235\n00:12:50.755 --> 00:12:55.394\nI just received information just two\nseconds ago, okay, so it doesn't matter.\n\n236\n00:12:55.394 --> 00:12:57.054\nSo it just went ahead and rebuilt.\n\n237\n00:12:57.054 --> 00:13:02.355\nSo remember it had gone all the way to\n130 by that point and now it's at 178.\n\n238\n00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:07.921\nSo this timer will always do that,\nyou should never see a number above 180.\n\n239\n00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.510\nOkay, here, if you do,\nsomebody is playing with you, okay.\n\n240\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.050\nAnd of course you should never\nsee a number below zero as\n\n241\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.630\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n242\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.704\n&gt;&gt; So if you do that,\n\n243\n00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:17.576\nthis line would actually be missing.\n\n244\n00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:22.270\nThe other thing that you see along with\nthe capability codes up here at the top,\n\n245\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.090\nis what we call the capabilities.\n\n246\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.395\nNotice the letter S shows us\nthe NYACCESS1 is a switch.\n\n247\n00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:32.270\nMm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the other thing that it also\n\n248\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:37.520\nshows us with the letter I here\nis that it's actually doing IGMP.\n\n249\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.600\nNow this is part of that messaging\nthat we're talking about,\n\n250\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.020\nthe advertisements that you and I are\ntalking about, it is actually doing this.\n\n251\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.492\nNow CDP works based on\nbroadcast is what it does.\n\n252\n00:13:47.492 --> 00:13:51.600\nThat means every device that's out there\nthat's using CDP and broadcasts that, and\n\n253\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.770\nas long as those CDP messages are received\nby another device that is also using CDP,\n\n254\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.420\nit will receive that as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n255\n00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.020\nthe broadcast goes out to everybody.\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n256\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.470\nit goes out to everybody.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n257\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.460\n&gt;&gt; But now if we compare that to NYEDGE1\n\n258\n00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.550\ndown here at the bottom, I'll notice\nthis one is an R, which means a router.\n\n259\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.898\nAnd you can also see that it has\nswitching capabilities as well.\n\n260\n00:14:11.898 --> 00:14:15.710\nSo NYACCESS, NYEDGE1,\n\n261\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:20.550\nit actually does routing and\nswitching and is also using IGMP as well.\n\n262\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.259\nAnd I see what it's doing\nwhich is a Cisco 2911.\n\n263\n00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:27.269\nSo it has a little bit of\nswitching capability in it, and\n\n264\n00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:31.260\nthat's because it has a switch between\na couple of interfaces as well.\n\n265\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.020\nSo you'll see all of that\ninformation reported right here\n\n266\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.050\nvery quickly when you start seeing some of\nthe other things that are bound in here.\n\n267\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.732\nBut that is just an example\nof what happens,\n\n268\n00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:42.750\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n269\n00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Now if we want to configure it though,\n\n270\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.060\nokay, so let's go ahead and\nshow you this too.\n\n271\n00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.200\nSo if I do a configure\nterminal that gets me\n\n272\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.680\ninto the global configuration mode which\naffects the entire switch it, okay.\n\n273\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.562\nIf I type in, no cdp run,\n\n274\n00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:09.979\nLike that, I have now disabled CDP for\nthe entire switch.\n\n275\n00:15:09.979 --> 00:15:16.820\nDo show cdp neighbors.\n\n276\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.370\nNow notice it says that\nCDP is not enabled.\n\n277\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:25.270\nSo that turns it off for that entire\nswitch if I do something like this, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.650\nNow I can turn that off if I if I go, hey,\n\n279\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.470\nI really don't want CDP\ntraffic coming to it.\n\n280\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.110\nSo that's very possible.\n\n281\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:40.220\nBut I can also go into\nan interface fa1/0/2,\n\n282\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.030\nand then if I wanted to enable it just for\na single interface here,\n\n283\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.796\nokay, just to be able to do something\nlike this, I can do cdp enable.\n\n284\n00:15:49.796 --> 00:15:55.690\nAnd let me do a question mark just in case\nthere's some other things here, okay.\n\n285\n00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.022\nIf I want to do this I also have\nto actually just say, look,\n\n286\n00:15:59.022 --> 00:16:03.310\nI had to turn on cdp So in other words,\nit actually requires both commands.\n\n287\n00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.240\nSo I was thinking it only needed one.\n\n288\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.825\nSo if I wanted to enable it on just this\none interface, that says I can't do it.\n\n289\n00:16:08.825 --> 00:16:11.776\nSo it actually makes me go back and\ndo the other one too.\n\n290\n00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:15.552\nWhat I have to do to enable it, cdp run.\n\n291\n00:16:15.552 --> 00:16:22.761\nAnd then I can go back and\ndo the interface fa1/0/22.\n\n292\n00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:24.762\nProbably, yeah, let me just do 22 again,\n\n293\n00:16:24.762 --> 00:16:27.890\nsince that's the one I picked\non at the very beginning here.\n\n294\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.250\nAnd then I can do the cdp enable.\n\n295\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.820\nNow, I don't know if anything's\nactually plugged into that one port.\n\n296\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.760\nBut I can do that for\nthat one interface as well.\n\n297\n00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.020\nSo it allows me to do that too.\n\n298\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.060\nSo that way,\nit's actually setting that up to do that.\n\n299\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.222\nNow, the other thing, of course, that you\ncan play around with if you choose to,\n\n300\n00:16:49.222 --> 00:16:51.980\nall right, after we've talked\nabout all this, is to say,\n\n301\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.130\nlook, we wanna set up\nthat CDP timer instead.\n\n302\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.432\nWell, you can, but there's really\nno good reason to change it, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:03.435\nBut if you wanted to,\nyou could do cdp timer.\n\n304\n00:17:03.435 --> 00:17:05.648\nAnd now, once you do that,\n\n305\n00:17:05.648 --> 00:17:10.566\nyou can actually do anywhere between 5 and\n254 seconds.\n\n306\n00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:14.821\nSo right now, I've set it 180,\nwhich is 3 minutes for us.\n\n307\n00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:16.913\nSo it gives us a little\nbit more if we want to,\n\n308\n00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:19.185\nit looks like up to four\nminutes if we choose to.\n\n309\n00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:23.440\nBut overall, though, if you wanted to\ndo that, that's what can be done, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.662\nSo that is the idea of CDP.\n\n311\n00:17:24.662 --> 00:17:29.483\nBut the key here, right, is to remember\nthat CDP is only for Cisco devices.\n\n312\n00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:33.260\nAnd it is on by default, okay,\nis what we end up seeing there.\n\n313\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.300\nSo once we get that all set up as\nwe do that, we are perfectly fine.\n\n314\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.950\nWe can set all that up, but normally,\nwe just kind of leave it alone in\n\n315\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.480\nthe background and let it do its thing.\n&gt;&gt; So here comes the softball now.\n\n316\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.880\nI'm throwing the curve.\n\n317\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.558\nWhat if I want to mix other vendors'\nequipment with Cisco equipment, Ronnie?\n\n318\n00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:50.228\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\n\n319\n00:17:50.228 --> 00:17:53.100\nif you want to do that, obviously,\nCDP is not going to work.\n\n320\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.870\nSo does that mean that those other\ndevices cannot be discovered for\n\n321\n00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.595\na logical topology of any sort?\n\n322\n00:17:58.595 --> 00:18:02.860\nNo, the other Layer Two Protocol, that of\ncourse is actually probably the one that\n\n323\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.930\nyou'll end up running more often\ntoday than not, is what we call LLDP,\n\n324\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.360\nwhich stands for\nLink Layer Discovery Protocol.\n\n325\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.810\nThis is an industry-standard\nversion of CDP, and\n\n326\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.640\nit is used with multiple vendors,\nincluding Cisco.\n\n327\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.340\nSo Cisco can run both, either CDP or LLDP.\n\n328\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.280\nIt doesn't matter to Cisco\nwhich one you chose to do.\n\n329\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.147\nIt of course says,\n\n330\n00:18:28.147 --> 00:18:31.740\nlook, we're not gonna enable the industry\nstandard when we can enable ours.\n\n331\n00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.560\nSo LLDP is not enabled by\ndefault when you do this.\n\n332\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.800\nNow, this one requires a little bit\nmore setup if you choose to do this\n\n333\n00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.810\none instead.\n\n334\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:45.287\nSo let me see if I can pick\non another device here.\n\n335\n00:18:45.287 --> 00:18:50.004\nWe'll use NYCORE2 since this is\nright over here for this one.\n\n336\n00:18:57.101 --> 00:19:01.181\nNow, the first thing I'm going to\ndo is just turn off CDP, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.538\nSo I don't anything actually running LLDP.\n\n338\n00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:07.630\nBut we'll just turn this one off just\nto show what happens here, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.994\nSo no cdp run, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:12.994 --> 00:19:16.200\nNow that I've done that,\nI'm kind of in trouble.\n\n341\n00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.850\nBecause I don't have any other\ndevices actually running LLDP either.\n\n342\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.820\nSo if I wanted to, I want to\nactually do two things here, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.650\nOn NYCORE2 here,\nwe're gonna do lldp receive,\n\n344\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.990\nif I can spell receive correctly.\n\n345\n00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.791\nLet me do a question mark if\nthere's anything else here.\n\n346\n00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:36.480\nOops, I misspelled receive.\n\n347\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.836\nlldp, let's just do that one,\nand then I'll, there we go.\n\n348\n00:19:41.836 --> 00:19:43.810\nAll right, I've jumped ahead of myself.\n\n349\n00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.580\nI was looking for LLDP receive,\nbut it's not in here.\n\n350\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.740\nBut I do see the one that I need,\n\n351\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.743\nwhich is LLDP enable, which is run.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n352\n00:19:51.743 --> 00:19:54.814\n&gt;&gt; So lldp run, okay, so\n\n353\n00:19:54.814 --> 00:19:58.695\nnow lldp run will go ahead and\n\n354\n00:19:58.695 --> 00:20:04.190\nallow me to enable that on this side.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n355\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.310\n&gt;&gt; Now let's go back to NYCORE1 for\n\n356\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.390\na moment here.\n\n357\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:13.131\nAnd let's go ahead and\ndo a no cdp run here too.\n\n358\n00:20:13.131 --> 00:20:18.290\nAnd then let's do an lldp run, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:23.400\nNow, on these two devices, I've turned\noff CDP, okay, and I've now enabled LLDP.\n\n360\n00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.440\nBut on all the other devices, I haven't.\n\n361\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.830\nSo at this point, we should be able\nto try and see what we can see here.\n\n362\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.560\nLet's do a show lldp.\n\n363\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.100\nLet me go back out to our\nproper command here, show lldp.\n\n364\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.990\nLet's do a question mark to see\nif there's anything else here.\n\n365\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.480\nSo at this point, it is showing me\njust a couple of things, right?\n\n366\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.980\nIt says the status is active, LLDP\nadvertisements are sent every 30 seconds.\n\n367\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.625\nSo notice this one is different, right?\n\n368\n00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:56.070\nLLDP does it every 30 seconds.\n\n369\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.225\nAnd the hold time is\na 120 seconds instead,\n\n370\n00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:04.040\nwhereas CDP was every 60 seconds,\nhold time 180 seconds, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.300\nLLDP about half that time, and\nonce again, it's the same idea right?\n\n372\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.769\nIf the other neighbor doesn't respond in\n120 seconds, then it gets dropped here,\n\n373\n00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:14.157\nand that's what you start to see.\n\n374\n00:21:14.157 --> 00:21:19.655\nAll right, so\nnow let's see if we can do a show lldp.\n\n375\n00:21:19.655 --> 00:21:24.695\nLet's do a question mark this time and\nsee what we can,\n\n376\n00:21:24.695 --> 00:21:28.760\nwell, maybe not, it won't let me do that.\n\n377\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.406\nAll right, well, show lldp.\n\n378\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.065\nLet's try a neighbor here.\n\n379\n00:21:39.065 --> 00:21:40.284\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n380\n00:21:40.284 --> 00:21:40.931\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping, I was like,\n\n381\n00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:42.644\nI hope this one actually works,\ncuz it doesn't show me the command.\n\n382\n00:21:42.644 --> 00:21:43.897\n&gt;&gt; It's his neighbor, of course,\n\n383\n00:21:43.897 --> 00:21:45.820\nof course it's the neighbor.\n&gt;&gt; So notice this.\n\n384\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.240\nThe commands aren't exactly different.\n\n385\n00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.990\nBut it's not showing me a lot here.\n\n386\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.100\nSo at this point, it does show\nme a couple of different things,\n\n387\n00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:52.790\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n388\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.392\n&gt;&gt; I have two connections over to NYCORE2,\n\n389\n00:21:57.392 --> 00:22:01.212\nand it's on fa0/24 and 23.\n\n390\n00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:04.640\nAnd they're actually connected to\nthe same ports over on the other side.\n\n391\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.450\nSo you can see where it is able to\ncommunicate using that one instead.\n\n392\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.470\nSo it does work.\n\n393\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.870\nIt allows you to do this.\n\n394\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.520\nBut this time, we're also missing some\ninformation that we didn't see before.\n\n395\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.380\nEven though it has some capabilities,\n\n396\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.922\nnotice the platform is not\nactually reported here.\n\n397\n00:22:20.922 --> 00:22:23.920\nBut overall, though,\nit does show us the same information.\n\n398\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.155\nSo depending on your particular network\nthat you have open and available to you,\n\n399\n00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:30.786\nyou can actually run\nwhichever one that you need.\n\n400\n00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:33.666\nBut if it's a mixed environment,\nyou're gonna run LLDP.\n\n401\n00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:38.341\nIf it's gonna be a single environment such\nas all Cisco devices, CDP of course for\n\n402\n00:22:38.341 --> 00:22:40.750\nCisco is the one that's preferred.\n\n403\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.860\nBut if you know that you're gonna be\nadding other vendors' equipment in\n\n404\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.000\nthe future, the recommendation\nof course is to run LLDP, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.460\nSo, Zach, that is just kind of a very\nsmall taste of what this stuff can do.\n\n406\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.680\nBut it is very powerful, especially when\nyou don't know what the layout is and\n\n407\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.760\nyou need to discover it quickly.\n\n408\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.410\nThe way to do so is using either one of\nthose two Link Layer Discovery Protocols\n\n409\n00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.790\nthat's there.\n&gt;&gt; Configure and\n\n410\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.090\nverify Layer Two Protocols,\nanother great episode.\n\n411\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.969\nRonnie, before we move on,\n\n412\n00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:10.866\nanything else you'd like to add?\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember that this is\n\n413\n00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:14.195\npart of something that you want\nto test out a little bit more,\n\n414\n00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:17.680\nand that this is not an official\nlab inside of our practice lab.\n\n415\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.890\nThis is one that I just kinda made\nup here so that we could see it.\n\n416\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.860\nBut it is part of the exam objectives.\n\n417\n00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.940\nSo you won't see a lot on it, but\nyou might actually see a question or two.\n\n418\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.360\nMake sure you know that acronym.\n\n419\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.710\nMake sure you understand what its purpose\nis and that it works at layer two.\n\n420\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.724\nAnd the funny thing,\na lot of times, right,\n\n421\n00:23:34.724 --> 00:23:38.630\nis even though it works at layer two,\nthere are more commands in show cdp.\n\n422\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.330\nAnd you can do those on your own.\n\n423\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.100\nIt will show you layer three information,\nwhich technically it's not supposed to,\n\n424\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.400\nbut it does, on CDP at least.\n\n425\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.600\nSo just go ahead and see, and\nyou'll actually see that there's more.\n\n426\n00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.620\nBut at least for us, for the CCENT, this\nwill be plenty for us to get started with.\n\n427\n00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.140\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Ronnie, thank you so much.\n\n428\n00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.640\nAnd Cisco CCENT is a wonderful series.\n\n429\n00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.472\nMake sure you watch each and\nevery episode.\n\n430\n00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:01.760\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n431\n00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.860\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\nwhere there's thousands of other videos.\n\n432\n00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.790\nAnd they're there to help you go further,\ncheck those out.\n\n433\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.642\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n434\n00:24:09.642 --> 00:24:11.640\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n435\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.900\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n436\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.257\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n437\n00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:22.166\n[MUSIC]\n\n438\n00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:25.419\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.625\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nwe continue on with CISCO CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.895\nWe're gonna configure and\nverify port security with the one and\n\n8\n00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.075\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you Zach for\n\n9\n00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.838\njoining me as we continue on\nour journey together in CCENT,\n\n10\n00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:36.046\nwe are here taking a look\nof course at port security.\n\n11\n00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:41.027\nWe've already described a lot of the LAN\nswitching concepts that we've needed to,\n\n12\n00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:45.812\nbut now we need to also take a look at the\nidea of implementing some port security.\n\n13\n00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.553\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n14\n00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Switches that are out of the box,\n\n15\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.758\nif you remember that when you first hold\nthem out and you plug a power into it.\n\n16\n00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:55.300\nYou can plug a cable in and\n\n17\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.360\nit will work right away.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.730\n&gt;&gt; So that sounds like a good idea okay?\n\n19\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.950\nBut now let's say that you've\nended up where you've cabled\n\n20\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.060\nevery single thing inside of that switch.\n\n21\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.410\nAnd they now go to different wall outlets,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.210\nDifferent networking jacks and\nthe wall outlets that are actually around.\n\n23\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.080\nAnd you have one in a public area,\nokay, and\n\n24\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.870\nyou've now connected that to your switch\nthrough the cabling in your building.\n\n25\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.432\nThat can actually be bad in one way or\nanother, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:28.780\nThe first bad thing it could be is\nthat since everything is actually\n\n27\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.672\non by default, okay, it means that\nsomebody that's not known to you could\n\n28\n00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:38.255\nsimply sit down near that particular\nnetwork jack, plug a device in,\n\n29\n00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:43.099\nthe switch will recognize the device and\nmaybe even give it an IP address.\n\n30\n00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.904\nWith all the other configurations that are\non it, allow it possibly also of course,\n\n31\n00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:49.811\nwill access out to the Internet.\n\n32\n00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.577\nSo you don't want something like that\nto happen where it's simply unplugs or\n\n33\n00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:57.157\nplugs in and then do something like that.\n\n34\n00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.816\nSo we've talked about how\nwe can kind of counter\n\n35\n00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:03.883\nact that by putting all of the switch\nports that we aren't using, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:08.589\nEven if they're not plugged in physically\naround the building, putting those into\n\n37\n00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.365\na parking lot VLAN where we say look,\nnothing's gonna access us and\n\n38\n00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.765\nwe only pull them and\nput them into active VLANs as we need to.\n\n39\n00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:19.402\nWe can also implement shutdown on\nthe ports that we're not using.\n\n40\n00:02:19.402 --> 00:02:22.890\nAnd that way we'll manually have\nto configure them to turn on and\n\n41\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.532\nonly enable them when we need to, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n42\n00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:27.665\n&gt;&gt; The other thing though that can happen\n\n43\n00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:29.070\nis something like this.\n\n44\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.270\nLet's take a look at my diagram here and\nthis will help us out a little bit.\n\n45\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.674\nSo instead of the situation which I just\ntold you about which is just an unattended\n\n46\n00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:40.803\noutlet, one that doesn't have\na cable plugged into it.\n\n47\n00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:45.397\nBut let's say it's actually one that\ndoes have something plugged into it such\n\n48\n00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:47.610\nas this server here, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.834\nSo when, if you remember\nthe functioning of the port security or\n\n50\n00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.240\nthe switch itself, right?\n\n51\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.700\nThese ports will begin to\npopulate as a MAC table here,\n\n52\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.990\na MAC address table based off\nthe source of the actual device itself.\n\n53\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.126\nSo it takes a MAC address,\nwhen it begins to communicate,\n\n54\n00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:10.700\nthe switch will learn on this port.\n\n55\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.630\nZero slash one.\n\n56\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.580\nHere is what the MAC address should be,\nand\n\n57\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.275\nit will populate the MAC address table\nwith the source IP of that packet.\n\n58\n00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:22.910\nThat also means that on\nthis port down here,\n\n59\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.700\nthe one with the orange cable that I\nhave set up, it also means that for\n\n60\n00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.760\nthat one it will do the same thing and\npopulate this one as well.\n\n61\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.630\nIf I can make it happen.\n\n62\n00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:39.647\nToo many, not enough.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n63\n00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:41.639\n&gt;&gt; All right so it will also if this one\n\n64\n00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.842\nactually sends data in it will also\npopulate that MAC address table too.\n\n65\n00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:46.424\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n66\n00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:48.626\n&gt;&gt; Okay so when we do something like this\n\n67\n00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:49.270\nit works.\n\n68\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.501\nOkay, because now these computers\nwill be able to communicate,\n\n69\n00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:53.804\nit won't really matter.\n\n70\n00:03:53.804 --> 00:03:58.618\nThe issue though that we might have is,\nlet's say that this is\n\n71\n00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:03.341\none of those places where nobody\nis really looking too much or\n\n72\n00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:08.619\ntoo carefully, that when somebody\nsneaky is doing is that they're\n\n73\n00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:14.640\nunplugging that one device and\nnow plugging it in to their computer.\n\n74\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.791\nAnd if they do something like this,\n\n75\n00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:21.237\nwell what can end up happening of course\nis that this particular one here,\n\n76\n00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:25.267\nand I'm gonna change up just one\nnumber here so that we can do this.\n\n77\n00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:32.034\nYou may end up seeing where now,\nIf I can do it.\n\n78\n00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:42.340\nWhere now that port number may end\nup with two different MAC addresses.\n\n79\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.073\nAnd it's works perfectly fine.\n\n80\n00:04:43.073 --> 00:04:45.881\nThe address table will take it,\nit's not gonna to complain,\n\n81\n00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.346\nit's not gonna to do anything.\n\n82\n00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:52.325\nSo even though they are plugged into\nboth of these devices it can do this.\n\n83\n00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.681\nAnd so now, this attacker\nthat I've represented in red,\n\n84\n00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:59.312\nthey may have access in by simply\ngoing around to some machine,\n\n85\n00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:02.823\nunplugging the network cable and\nplugging their device in.\n\n86\n00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:08.885\nSo what we can do to prevent that\nis that on an individual port,\n\n87\n00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:14.630\nlike this one that the orange\ncable is plugged into.\n\n88\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.960\nWe can implement what\nwe call port security.\n\n89\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.327\nPort security allows us to do some\nsecurity based on the MAC address itself.\n\n90\n00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:26.060\nWe can do it in a couple\nof different ways, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.025\nWhen we start talking about the idea\nof implementation of port security,\n\n92\n00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:38.290\nI can manually configure this port to\naccept only the MAC addresses I type in.\n\n93\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.398\nSo even if an attacker comes in and\nbrings their computer to do this and\n\n94\n00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:44.090\nit says you're not one of\nthe addresses that were typed in.\n\n95\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.694\nYou're not going to be able\nto use this port, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:48.491\nSo that's one way that we can do that.\n\n97\n00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.538\nAnother thing that we can also\ndo instead is to when we plug\n\n98\n00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:59.532\na device into that port is that we\ncan say learn about that address and\n\n99\n00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:04.174\nmake sure that that gets\ninto the MAC address table.\n\n100\n00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:07.497\nBut then I can limit the number of IP,\nor not IP,\n\n101\n00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:11.668\nMAC addresses that can be stored for\nthat individual port.\n\n102\n00:06:11.668 --> 00:06:14.153\nSo if I wanted to I could restrict it and\n\n103\n00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:17.039\nlimit it down to one MAC\naddress if I do that.\n\n104\n00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:22.888\nSo that way, if there's only one available\nMAC address on this port, Zach, and\n\n105\n00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:28.392\nit's already filled with the one with\nall fives, if an attacker comes in and\n\n106\n00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:33.143\nsimply unplugs the cable,\nit will not be able to make an entry in.\n\n107\n00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.930\nNow I can't delete it.\n\n108\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.805\nIt will not be able to configure\nanother device on that port,\n\n109\n00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:40.863\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n110\n00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:43.790\n&gt;&gt; So that is possible as well, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.710\nThe other thing that we can\nalso of course do here okay\n\n112\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.060\nis to just say here is what\nwe want to make sure of.\n\n113\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.860\nBecause it can also lose this\nconfiguration quickly if the device\n\n114\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.720\nreboots.\n\n115\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.920\nIt's not necessarily persistent here.\n\n116\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.812\nThat means every time it reboots right\nthis MAC address table goes away.\n\n117\n00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:09.621\nAnd if it does what if this guy is plugged\nin instead while the switch is rebooted?\n\n118\n00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:13.807\nWell that means that the first address\nthat gets plugged in is gonna be here, and\n\n119\n00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.160\nnow I've implemented port security.\n\n120\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.010\nSo if I now realize that there's\na cable hanging loose and I try and\n\n121\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.260\nplug this guy back again.\n\n122\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.040\nWell now there's an issue because now it's\nlike, we already have a MAC address and\n\n123\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.410\nit's stuck there.\n\n124\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.710\nSo what we can do is tell it, look,\n\n125\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.330\nI want this to be persistent\nthrough reboots as well.\n\n126\n00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.300\nSo all that's possible\nwhen you start doing this.\n\n127\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.610\nSo static entry means we type\nin the mac address itself.\n\n128\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.187\nAnd then a static is gonna\nstay there permanently.\n\n129\n00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:44.344\nIt doesn't matter what happens to\nthe router, is going to stay there.\n\n130\n00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:44.936\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n131\n00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:46.503\n&gt;&gt; But that means I also actually have to\n\n132\n00:07:46.503 --> 00:07:48.488\ndo all that for\nall the ports that come online.\n\n133\n00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:49.633\n&gt;&gt; Boards is right.\n\n134\n00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:51.919\n&gt;&gt; So if I have a 48 port switch which I\n\n135\n00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:56.723\ncan have and now I'm using all 48 ports,\nthat's a lot of MAC addresses,\n\n136\n00:07:56.723 --> 00:08:00.079\na lot of information that's\ntyped in this format and\n\n137\n00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.998\nin just letters A through G and\n0 through 9.\n\n138\n00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:05.959\nThat's a lot of information that\nI don't want to have to type in.\n\n139\n00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.805\nIt really is,\nI don't want to have to do that.\n\n140\n00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:08.972\n&gt;&gt; So is there a way to do it so\n\n141\n00:08:08.972 --> 00:08:12.690\nthat you can knock it all out in one shot?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, well not in one shot, right?\n\n142\n00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.250\nBut there are different ways so, but\n\n143\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.460\njust make sure that we understand\nthat we can statically do it.\n\n144\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.840\nAnd then we can do dynamic and that's\nwhat we're talking about here, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.840\nDynamic is saying learn about it.\n\n146\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.430\nAnd keep it there.\n\n147\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.420\nBut then we have to restrict the number\nof Mac addresses we'll allow for\n\n148\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.690\nthat port to learn, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.650\nBut remember that like I\nsaid on a reboot though,\n\n150\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.450\nthis Mac address table\nclears up on a reboot.\n\n151\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.600\nSo if we end up where a malicious\ndevice is attached to it,\n\n152\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.360\nand that get's in the table before and\nwe've limited it to one.\n\n153\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.980\nAnd now a legitimate device\nthat plugs in that port\n\n154\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.670\nis not gonna be recognized.\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n155\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.650\n&gt;&gt; So instead, what we can do is say,\n\n156\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.440\nlook, we'll do it this way,\n\n157\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.210\nwhere it will learn about the first Mac\naddresses that are plugged into this port,\n\n158\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.330\nbut keep that persistent in the Mac\naddress table between reboots.\n\n159\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.760\nAnd then you don't have to\nworry about something like\n\n160\n00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.520\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n161\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.148\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna show you of course\n\n162\n00:09:04.148 --> 00:09:05.900\nan example of how we do this, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.941\nSo once we get this all set up,\n\n164\n00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:13.103\nwe also have to decide what happens if\nthe port security gets violated too.\n\n165\n00:09:13.103 --> 00:09:18.730\nThere is always a full\nconfiguration includes not only.\n\n166\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.680\nBut also saying what is to happen,\nwhen it actually gets violated.\n\n167\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.560\nAnd that's what we are about to show you.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n168\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.890\n&gt;&gt; So we are gonna use NYCORE1,\n\n169\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.570\nas we get started here.\n\n170\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:34.090\nTo essentially help us to initiate\nstatic port security at the beginning,\n\n171\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.420\nand then we will initiate what we\ncall the dynamic port security.\n\n172\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.420\nSo using NYCORE1, and I'll zoom in.\n\n173\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.730\nWe are hopefully getting too wide and\noff board here.\n\n174\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:52.020\nAnd let's go ahead and\nget into our privilege exact mode here,\n\n175\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.624\nthen I'm gonna type in,\nshow mac address-table.\n\n176\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.490\nWhen I do that it's going to show\nthe entire address table and\n\n177\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.130\nnotice that there is a couple of\ndifferent entries in here Zack.\n\n178\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.590\nOne of course are the ones\nmarked as static, and\n\n179\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.910\nthen the other ones are marked as dynamic.\n\n180\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.110\nWhen you and I are dealing with this we're\ngoing to be messing around with dynamic\n\n181\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.480\nones is what we're gonna be dealing with.\n\n182\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.340\nThe static ones you can even see\nwhere it's connected to the CPU.\n\n183\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.850\nSo you and I can't change this.\n\n184\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.350\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n185\n00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.030\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we're\n\n186\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.650\ngonna be down here and you're also gonna\nsee an interface attached to them as well.\n\n187\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.073\nOkay?\nSo on this one, the interface that we\n\n188\n00:10:32.073 --> 00:10:37.355\nare going to be messing around\nwith is gonna be the Fa1/0/1.\n\n189\n00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:41.053\nAnd I'm simply going to\ncopy this Mac address so\n\n190\n00:10:41.053 --> 00:10:47.074\nI can statically enter it in for port\nsecurity, is what I'm going to do here.\n\n191\n00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:50.320\nSo that is the that one I'm copying for\nright now.\n\n192\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.270\nNow once I get that port address, now, or\n\n193\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:59.150\nthat network Mac address, let me go\ninto our global configuration mode.\n\n194\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.000\nAnd then we're going to enter\nin our port security, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.530\nSo when we start to enter\nin our port security.\n\n196\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.140\nI'm gonna make sure that you can see that.\n\n197\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.290\nI don't know it bugs me when I\nsee more than what I need to.\n\n198\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.330\nSo here,\nwhen we actually get into NYCORE1.\n\n199\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.810\nI now need to make sure that I\nget in to that interface too.\n\n200\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:26.149\nSo interface fastethernet.\n\n201\n00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:28.381\nIt's gonna be 1/0/1.\n\n202\n00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:32.985\nSo now that I'm inside that interface,\nI need to make sure that I implement port\n\n203\n00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:37.260\nsecurity but port security is\nonly implemented on switchports.\n\n204\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.360\nThe switchport, access port, excuse me.\n\n205\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:46.820\nSo you type in the word switchport\nas a key word mode access, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.010\nSo when we set up trunks, we would've\nactually done switchport mode trunk.\n\n207\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.320\nCan you implement port\nsecurity on a trunk port?\n\n208\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.820\nYes, you can.\n\n209\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.180\nbut it's probably not\nsomething we would tend to do.\n\n210\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.880\nBest practice is to\nactually only implement\n\n211\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.340\nthe idea of port security\nhere on access ports.\n\n212\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:07.050\nThe point, I've never actually seen it\nimplemented on trump ports at all, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.720\nBut can you do it?\n\n214\n00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.900\nYes, it is possible.\n\n215\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.560\nLet's do a switchport now and the second\npart of this is now configuring and\n\n216\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.609\nwe're going to configure\na static Mac address here.\n\n217\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.320\nSwitchport port-security.\n\n218\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.252\nOkay if I typed in switchport correctly.\n\n219\n00:12:22.252 --> 00:12:26.129\nSwitchport port-security.\n\n220\n00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:28.841\nThen mac-address.\n\n221\n00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:35.420\nAnd now I am going to paste that\nIP that Mac address in there.\n\n222\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.722\nAnd it should accept it\nwhich is what it did here.\n\n223\n00:12:38.722 --> 00:12:41.115\nOkay so\nnow that I've got that set in there.\n\n224\n00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:45.460\nNow in that term, in that syntax right.\n\n225\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.810\nSwitchport is essentially what this is,\n\n226\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.850\nit's a switch that's on a port,\nas a port that's on the switch.\n\n227\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.955\nDamn, my terminologies is wrong,\nwe're implementing port security.\n\n228\n00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:58.700\nWe are now mainly setting the Mac address.\n\n229\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.560\nThat's what we're doing here okay?\n\n230\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.680\nSo that's that part of.\n\n231\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.960\nRemember it's on an axis port as well.\n\n232\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.360\nNow, once we've got that,\nthe configuration that we missed\n\n233\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.948\nthe most here, okay, is the one that\nactually is by far the most common.\n\n234\n00:13:12.948 --> 00:13:20.670\nIt's switchport here, port-security, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.230\nNow when we do that, it doesn't\nseem like it really adds in much.\n\n236\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.470\nLike well, didn't the first part of\nthe line that we just did above that\n\n237\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.610\ndidn't that actually set everything up?\n\n238\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.775\nIt did not.\n\n239\n00:13:31.775 --> 00:13:36.503\nSwitchport port-security by\nitself essentially enables\n\n240\n00:13:36.503 --> 00:13:39.535\nthe port security for FA 1/0/1.\n\n241\n00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:44.421\nSo if I do not have that in there,\neven though I've configured it for\n\n242\n00:13:44.421 --> 00:13:47.612\nport-security it's just not gonna work.\n\n243\n00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:52.353\nSo make sure you have both of those lines\nin there that you need to implement\n\n244\n00:13:52.353 --> 00:13:54.870\nport security, okay.\n\n245\n00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.780\nSo that is key, now the way that I\nnormally do this is because I know I\n\n246\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.022\nwill forget that as I\nnormally put that in first.\n\n247\n00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:07.825\nSo I'll do switchport mode access\nthen I will type in switchport\n\n248\n00:14:07.825 --> 00:14:12.110\nport-security next is what\nI normally do by default.\n\n249\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.290\nBut the how far along and\n\n250\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.350\nthe lab guides that you'll be\nusing with practice labs here.\n\n251\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.820\nThis is the one that you're gonna follow.\n\n252\n00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.340\nAnd Zack, I just remember something.\n\n253\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.600\nI didn't actually even mention\nthe lab that you'll be\n\n254\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.290\nusing in.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.190\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens, right?\n\n256\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:29.120\nSo we're using the configure and\nverified troubleshoot port security.\n\n257\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.040\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n258\n00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.560\n&gt;&gt; The lab that I've got that you're be\n\n259\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.720\nusing there to help you out, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.788\nSo now, port security in theory here,\nshould actually be ready to go.\n\n261\n00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:44.871\nAnd let's see if zoom in a little bit\nmore there, oops, let me do all that,\n\n262\n00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:48.761\nlet me get all the way back out\nto our privilege mode here.\n\n263\n00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:53.344\nAll right let's verify a couple of\nthings on the switch here, okay.\n\n264\n00:14:53.344 --> 00:15:00.605\nSo if I choose to type in show,\nwhich is always a good command,\n\n265\n00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:08.305\nshow port-security then\ninterface fastethernet 1/0/1.\n\n266\n00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:15.480\nAnd let me hit enter just a couple of\ntimes so that we can see it, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.620\nWhat are we trying to verify?\n\n268\n00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.790\nWe're trying to verify that port security\nis, well first of all, enabled, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.310\nSo it is enabled.\n\n270\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.970\nSecondly, notice the status.\n\n271\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.600\nSecure up means, hey,\nI'm running port security.\n\n272\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.010\nThis port is at this point here.\n\n273\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.770\nAlso operational, it is up.\n\n274\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.950\nHere is kind of the neat thing.\n\n275\n00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.860\nViolation mode,\nI said that you also have to go ahead and\n\n276\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.780\nsay what do you want to happen\nif port security gets violated?\n\n277\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.917\nAnd usually,\nthere is three options here and\n\n278\n00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:52.122\nwe'll take a look at those\nwhen we get to them.\n\n279\n00:15:52.122 --> 00:15:56.950\nBut there's only shutdown, there's\nprotect and then there's restrict, and\n\n280\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.653\nwe'll get to those in just a little\nbit here I wanna make that.\n\n281\n00:16:00.653 --> 00:16:03.964\nWe'll get to those in a little\nbit here in just a moment, okay,\n\n282\n00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:05.974\nwhen we implement on another device.\n\n283\n00:16:05.974 --> 00:16:08.789\nOkay, on another port\nas well what happened.\n\n284\n00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:13.086\nAlso at this point notice\nthe maximum number of MAC addresses.\n\n285\n00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:17.129\nOkay, now Zack you and\nI did not actually do this.\n\n286\n00:16:17.129 --> 00:16:20.988\nOkay, we didn't actually enter in what\nthe violation was, what it was here.\n\n287\n00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:21.741\nAnd you and\n\n288\n00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:26.680\nI didn't tell it what the total number\nof MAC address set actually is.\n\n289\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.770\nSo that means that these\nare default configurations.\n\n290\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.306\nSo they said look, you set up this much,\nyou didn't set up the rest of it.\n\n291\n00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:36.220\nSo we're gonna use the default\nways that we chose.\n\n292\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.831\nSo you understand something that\nthe ID has actually have shutdown.\n\n293\n00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:44.291\nMeans that if the violation happens,\nif any other address,\n\n294\n00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:50.149\nMac address besides this one, gets\nentered in, it's not just gonna tell you,\n\n295\n00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:53.321\nit's gonna shut the port down.\n&gt;&gt; But just that port?\n\n296\n00:16:53.321 --> 00:16:54.039\n&gt;&gt; Just that port.\n\n297\n00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:54.758\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n298\n00:16:54.758 --> 00:16:55.978\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just that port,\n\n299\n00:16:55.978 --> 00:16:57.383\nit is going to shut it down.\n\n300\n00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:01.281\nSo if it sees a second MAC address,\nit will shut it down, okay,\n\n301\n00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:03.134\nthat's what we're saying.\n\n302\n00:17:03.134 --> 00:17:05.753\nAnd if it sees another MAC\naddress in it's place.\n\n303\n00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:10.497\nIt's gonna shut down because we have now\nconfigured that manually by doing this,\n\n304\n00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:14.362\neven through reboot,\nthis is statically configured now, okay.\n\n305\n00:17:14.362 --> 00:17:21.603\nSo if I type in a show mac address-table.\n\n306\n00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:27.723\nAnd this time I will use\nthe command here and\n\n307\n00:17:27.723 --> 00:17:33.852\nwill do a begin with, think dynamic here.\n\n308\n00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:35.885\nI can't remember if it's actual capital or\nnot.\n\n309\n00:17:35.885 --> 00:17:38.121\nWe'll have to see,\nI know it's case sensitive.\n\n310\n00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:41.292\nSo it's case sensitive,\nthat's what I've got to remember.\n\n311\n00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:47.343\nIt is actually, it's all capitals here,\n\n312\n00:17:47.343 --> 00:17:51.553\nshow mac address dash table.\n\n313\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.926\nBegin DYNAMIC.\n\n314\n00:17:56.926 --> 00:17:57.928\nLet's see if we can do anything.\n\n315\n00:17:57.928 --> 00:18:00.162\nThere we go, I was like,\nit should be there.\n\n316\n00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:06.339\nSo if we see this, now notice it\nnow sets itself as being static.\n\n317\n00:18:06.339 --> 00:18:07.077\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n318\n00:18:07.077 --> 00:18:08.804\n&gt;&gt; And that is going to work the same way\n\n319\n00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:11.750\nas what the CPU is,\nthat means it will survive a persistent.\n\n320\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.878\nPersistently, even if the reboot happens.\n\n321\n00:18:14.878 --> 00:18:19.101\nSo now this is set in there the way\nthat we want it to be set, okay.\n\n322\n00:18:19.101 --> 00:18:19.841\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n323\n00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:22.631\n&gt;&gt; This actually does help us out at this\n\n324\n00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:23.265\npoint.\n\n325\n00:18:23.265 --> 00:18:27.547\nNow, in our lab, because you and I don't\nphysically have the ability to unplug this\n\n326\n00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:30.040\ndevice and plug another one in to FA1/0/1.\n\n327\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.312\nThat means that we're gonna have to go\nto a different port to enable the other\n\n328\n00:18:36.312 --> 00:18:40.275\nports security we're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n329\n00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:41.546\n&gt;&gt; So me, typing it in,\n\n330\n00:18:41.546 --> 00:18:42.828\nis one thing, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:42.828 --> 00:18:47.893\nBut what if I said, hey, I wanted\nto learn about an address instead.\n\n332\n00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:51.107\nSo that's what we also want\nto be able to do here too.\n\n333\n00:18:51.107 --> 00:18:54.488\nSo now, we're going to switch up here and\n\n334\n00:18:54.488 --> 00:18:59.813\nwe are going to take a look at\nanother one Is what's gonna happen.\n\n335\n00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:05.754\nSo over on NYCORE 2 is where we're going.\n\n336\n00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:09.956\nLet me select NYCORE 2.\n\n337\n00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:19.967\nAnd on NYCORE 2, we have, well one other\none that we are gonna mess with here.\n\n338\n00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:30.762\nShow mac address – table.\n\n339\n00:19:30.762 --> 00:19:32.696\nAnd we'll begin with dynamic.\n\n340\n00:19:32.696 --> 00:19:37.070\nAnd we will take a look at this.\n\n341\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:42.773\nOkay, so now I can see the addresses\nthat are set dynamically.\n\n342\n00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:46.500\nThese are the only ones that we're gonna\nbe able to mess with at this point.\n\n343\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.977\nBut the one that I'm looking\nat is gonna be right here.\n\n344\n00:19:49.977 --> 00:19:51.289\nNotice this one,\n\n345\n00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:56.809\ndynamic means it learned this particular\nMAC address by being plugged in.\n\n346\n00:19:56.809 --> 00:20:00.220\nIn other words, the device plugged in,\nit said hey, what's your MAC address?\n\n347\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.834\nAnd it learned the source MAC address\non it, and so we are up and fine.\n\n348\n00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:07.668\nAll right, now,\nwe wanna shut down this interface.\n\n349\n00:20:07.668 --> 00:20:13.681\nSo let me get into the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n350\n00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:18.273\nand then interface fa1/0/12.\n\n351\n00:20:18.273 --> 00:20:21.292\nFrom here, let's issue a shut down for\nright now.\n\n352\n00:20:21.292 --> 00:20:25.313\nNow we're having to do this so that we can\nmake sure that we show you the violation\n\n353\n00:20:25.313 --> 00:20:27.544\nthat can also end up happening here, okay.\n\n354\n00:20:27.544 --> 00:20:29.608\nSo once I do something like this,\n\n355\n00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:33.388\nI wanna make sure that the port\nsecurity is not enabled here.\n\n356\n00:20:33.388 --> 00:20:40.433\nSo I'm gonna type in\na clear port-security.\n\n357\n00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:41.902\nActually, I haven't\nactually done anything.\n\n358\n00:20:41.902 --> 00:20:44.923\nSo I'm going a little bit too far there,\nokay.\n\n359\n00:20:44.923 --> 00:20:48.627\nI'm trying to actually clear everything\nout before I even configured it,\n\n360\n00:20:48.627 --> 00:20:49.577\nthat's my fault.\n\n361\n00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:52.377\nI looked down my list\na little bit too hard there.\n\n362\n00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:55.028\nI'm like where did I go, that's really.\n&gt;&gt; Your heart was in the right place\n\n363\n00:20:55.028 --> 00:20:56.308\nRonnie.\n&gt;&gt; Tell me about it,\n\n364\n00:20:56.308 --> 00:20:58.693\nI was absolutely wrong at that point,\nokay?\n\n365\n00:20:58.693 --> 00:21:02.423\nSo let's do that, all right.\n\n366\n00:21:02.423 --> 00:21:05.726\nLet me make sure that I spell\nwhat I need to right, okay.\n\n367\n00:21:05.726 --> 00:21:08.560\nSo we'll go back to our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n368\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.260\nI tell you I didn't look at them,\nI was like why am I doing that already but\n\n369\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.129\nI thought maybe I already\nconfigured something there.\n\n370\n00:21:15.129 --> 00:21:21.263\nSo let me turn that thing back on,\ninterface fa1/0/12 and\n\n371\n00:21:21.263 --> 00:21:24.678\nthen do a no shutdown for right now.\n\n372\n00:21:24.678 --> 00:21:28.282\nAll right, so once I get that thing up and\nrunning, let's go ahead and\n\n373\n00:21:28.282 --> 00:21:30.678\nconfigure this one for\nport security as well.\n\n374\n00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:34.879\nSwitchport mode access, and\n\n375\n00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:41.601\nthen switchport\nport-security that is time,\n\n376\n00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:46.144\nwe're gonna do mac-address.\n\n377\n00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:52.711\nAnd I just typed in there one last time,\nokay, that's fine so which part.\n\n378\n00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.068\nI don't why that looks funny to me but\nthat's it.\n\n379\n00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:58.769\nLet's do a question mark here and show\nthe options that you have available, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:58.769 --> 00:22:03.582\nOn the options that we have up and\navailable here is these two options.\n\n381\n00:22:03.582 --> 00:22:07.152\nThere is us typing in\nthe Mac address itself, or\n\n382\n00:22:07.152 --> 00:22:09.752\nwe can use the word sticky, okay.\n\n383\n00:22:09.752 --> 00:22:14.227\nNow that sounds funny but it is true,\nwe can actually do either one of them.\n\n384\n00:22:14.227 --> 00:22:18.111\nSticky, it says configure the dynamic\nsecure address as sticky.\n\n385\n00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:22.386\nNow I didn't show you that, but we'll\nshow you this here in a moment as well.\n\n386\n00:22:22.386 --> 00:22:25.649\nSo on this idea of sticky,\nit means learn the mac\n\n387\n00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:30.230\naddress in the same way it did it before,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n388\n00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.758\nBut make sure that this survives a reboot,\nthat's what sticky means.\n\n389\n00:22:34.758 --> 00:22:39.437\nA lot of issue sticking there,\nthat is you know, at this point here\n\n390\n00:22:39.437 --> 00:22:44.303\njust as simply as doing the same\nthing which is typing in the address.\n\n391\n00:22:44.303 --> 00:22:48.165\nSo sticky says, learn it dynamically and\nkeep with it as well.\n\n392\n00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:50.310\nIf we type it in it's gonna\nstatically set it and\n\n393\n00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.143\nthat's what we'll also end up having.\n\n394\n00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:55.063\nSo at this point we're just\ngonna use that keyword sticky.\n\n395\n00:22:55.063 --> 00:22:59.748\nSo let's try this one one more time,\n\n396\n00:22:59.748 --> 00:23:06.853\nswitchport port-security if\nI can actually do a dash,\n\n397\n00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:13.063\nport-security mac-address and then sticky.\n\n398\n00:23:13.063 --> 00:23:17.259\nI only have to configure the mac address\nI just tell it here is what I want to do.\n\n399\n00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:22.044\nNow, once you do this you also\nwant to be able to manually set\n\n400\n00:23:22.044 --> 00:23:24.551\nswitchport port-security.\n\n401\n00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:28.659\nAnd now we can set a maximum.\n\n402\n00:23:28.659 --> 00:23:33.698\nNow, this is telling us the maximum\nnumber of mac addresses that\n\n403\n00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:38.751\nwe want to be able to learn, and\nours, we're gonna set it to 1.\n\n404\n00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:41.888\nNow in a production environment\nyou may wanna set this to two or\n\n405\n00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:45.102\nthree now you might be wondering,\nwhy the heck would I do that.\n\n406\n00:23:45.102 --> 00:23:49.228\nWell, if you end up bringing in lets\nsay a laptop or for one reason or\n\n407\n00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:51.231\nsomebody switches computers.\n\n408\n00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:55.261\nYour desktop computer ends up dying,\nokay, you only have it set to one Mac\n\n409\n00:23:55.261 --> 00:23:58.252\naddress Well,\nthere's a couple of things you can do.\n\n410\n00:23:58.252 --> 00:24:00.622\nOne, you can take the NIC\nout of your workstation,\n\n411\n00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:03.835\nmake sure that stays with the new\ncomputer that's being brought in.\n\n412\n00:24:03.835 --> 00:24:06.250\nOr, if you set it to two, right?\n\n413\n00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.896\nThat means, if somebody has to replace\nyour computer and put another one\n\n414\n00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:13.760\nat its place, you will know bov,\nas what will end up happening here.\n\n415\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.400\nSo then, when somebody goes and\nrepairs the old computer,\n\n416\n00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.490\nand they bring that one back to you,\nyou again,\n\n417\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.380\nall you have to do is switch cables, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n418\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.830\n&gt;&gt; But if you only set it to one,\n\n419\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.040\nit means it's gonna stay in\nhere until somebody fixes that\n\n420\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.110\nin our default setting.\n\n421\n00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:34.080\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\ndo a switchport there, switchport port-\n\n422\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.682\nMan, for one reason or another,\nI look at the word switchport and\n\n423\n00:24:42.682 --> 00:24:44.820\nit just looks weird in my mind.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.960\n&gt;&gt; But I spelled it right,\n\n425\n00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.990\ncuz I'm spelling it correctly.\n\n426\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.340\nSwitchport port-security, this time\nwe're going to set the violation.\n\n427\n00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.850\nNow let's do an idea here, okay?\n\n428\n00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.110\nAnd let's go ahead and hit the help.\n\n429\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:07.050\nNotice there is protect, there is\nrestrict, and there is also shutdown, when\n\n430\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.610\nwe start seeing the difference here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n431\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.320\n&gt;&gt; So let's make sure we understand.\n\n432\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.720\nThe default is shutdown.\n\n433\n00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.280\nWhat shutdown means, right,\nis violate this port security.\n\n434\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.890\nI'm going to disable this port.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n435\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.980\n&gt;&gt; By disabling that port,\n\n436\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.900\nit means I will not let it turn back\non until an administrator comes and\n\n437\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.610\nfixes what the issue is.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n438\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's the idea of shutdown.\n\n439\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.130\nProtect though, it says look.\n\n440\n00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.310\nLet's talk about this for\na moment here, okay?\n\n441\n00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.520\nSo what it might do as we\nstart to do this, right,\n\n442\n00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.080\nis that it will still allow for\nwhat ever Mac address it learned.\n\n443\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.353\nOkay, but any thing else,\nany other Mac address that comes through,\n\n444\n00:25:50.353 --> 00:25:53.430\nit just says I'm not going to let it work.\n\n445\n00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.300\nOkay, so you unplug it, and\nyou plug-in another it goes yeah.\n\n446\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.120\nI'm just not going to let you work.\n\n447\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.140\nWhich is fine, so you can do that.\n\n448\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.380\nAnd that's what protect does instead.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n449\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Restrict is almost the same as protect.\n\n450\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.900\nAnd says look,\nhere is my configure MAC address,\n\n451\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.600\nI just learned this, I'm keeping\nit through a reboot if I need to.\n\n452\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.280\nPerfectly fine, that will work for me.\n\n453\n00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.250\nBut, the other thing I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna send a log message, okay?\n\n454\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:27.340\nI'm gonna log the fact that somebody has\ntried to put in another device, okay.\n\n455\n00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.890\nSo if there's anything that's\nactually between these two,\n\n456\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.930\nit's about the idea of logging, okay.\n\n457\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.660\nRestrict logs the fact that\na violation has happened,\n\n458\n00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.120\nwhereas protect just says look, I'm going\nensure a violation doesn't happen, okay.\n\n459\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.990\nRestrict says, I'm going to ensure\na violation doesn't happen, but\n\n460\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:51.110\nI'm also gonna report on the very fact\nthat it did happen, and it is probably\n\n461\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.680\nthe MAC address that tried to do this.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure it's not one size fits all,\n\n462\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.700\nbut the restrict sounds\nlike the better option.\n\n463\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.360\n&gt;&gt; The restrict between the two is\n\n464\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.000\nthe more secure of the options,\n\n465\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.760\nbecause logging is a very\nimportant part of what we do.\n\n466\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.590\nThe most secure of course is shut down.\n\n467\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.340\nShut down let's you know an error occurred\nand it's going to stop all traffic.\n\n468\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.190\nIt doesn't matter if you have\nthe good device plugged back in,\n\n469\n00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.580\nit's not gonna turn back on,\nit's gonna say you fix the problem, and\n\n470\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.250\nthen I'll allow you to\nmanually turn it back on.\n\n471\n00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.530\nYou literally have to go into that\ninterface once you fix the problem,\n\n472\n00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:25.250\nyou have to issue a shut down,\nand then a no shutdown again.\n\n473\n00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.480\nSo even if it actually says it's shutdown,\nit says line down, protocol down,\n\n474\n00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.650\nyou still have to issue the word shutdown,\nand then you have to issue no shutdown.\n\n475\n00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.630\nIt's like you walking in the room and\nflipping the switch off,\n\n476\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.820\nand flipping it back on like resetting it.\n\n477\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.520\nSo that's why shutdown is\nby far the most secure.\n\n478\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.750\nBut that means manually once again, or\n\n479\n00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.370\nadministratively, you have to check for\nthis.\n\n480\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.520\nAnd that means a lot more administrative\neffort on your part as well.\n\n481\n00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.750\nBut usually that's the default.\n\n482\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.480\nThat's by far the most secure of them all.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n483\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.570\n&gt;&gt; But you don't wanna be, if wanna go on,\n\n484\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.650\nI just wanna see what's happening here.\n\n485\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.060\nRestrict is the better one.\n\n486\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.380\nI know it's still protected I'll allow for\n\n487\n00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.250\nthe Mac addresses that\nare configured on here to work.\n\n488\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.720\nBut I'm not gonna allow for anything else,\n\n489\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.240\nwell then choosing these other two\noptions are also good for you as well.\n\n490\n00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.780\nSo protect may be the better one if you\nknow that your environment is constantly\n\n491\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.310\nchanging, and people are just swapping\ncomputers in and out and doing all that.\n\n492\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.590\nBut most of the time, right?\n\n493\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.070\nRestrict is probably\nthe one that let you know\n\n494\n00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.040\nwhat you want to be able to do.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n495\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n496\n00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.640\nnow that we've got this\nconfigured in terms of dynamic,\n\n497\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.020\nwhat we wanna do is show the port\nsecurity on the interface as well.\n\n498\n00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:39.511\nLet's go back out here,\nnow we're gonna do a show,\n\n499\n00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:47.876\nport-security Interface\nfastethernet 1/0/12.\n\n500\n00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:53.690\nAnd notice again,\nthis one is a little bit different.\n\n501\n00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.590\nIt is now secured down,\nwhich is what we're expecting to see, and\n\n502\n00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.170\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n503\n00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.260\nPort Security right now is Disabled.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n504\n00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.850\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why,\n\n505\n00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.130\nright, is that I forgot a command here,\nokay?\n\n506\n00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.700\nRemember I told you that if there's a\ncommand that's gonna be forgotten, that's\n\n507\n00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.320\ngonna be the one that I shouldn't forget?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n508\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.534\n&gt;&gt; So if I get back in there,\n\n509\n00:29:15.534 --> 00:29:19.444\nint fa1/0/12, I need the switchport\n\n510\n00:29:22.103 --> 00:29:28.150\nport-security to essentially turn it on or\nto enable it, and\n\n511\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:33.406\nthen, I can exit back out and\ntype in that same thing.\n\n512\n00:29:33.406 --> 00:29:40.381\nShow port-security interface fa1/0/12.\n\n513\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.184\nAnd now verify Port Security\nas now Enabled, and\n\n514\n00:29:45.184 --> 00:29:48.360\nnow it's actually showing,\nit should be up.\n\n515\n00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.680\nShowing Secure-up, which is actually\nwhat I do have, that's fine,\n\n516\n00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.820\ncuz I was like Secure down, yeah, it's\ndown because I didn't have Port Security.\n\n517\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.350\nSo, that's why I was like that's right,\nokay?\n\n518\n00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.940\nSo Violation Mode at this point, we\njust left, I left it Shutdown cuz that's\n\n519\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.470\nthe one that the one that I'll\nprobably choose if I chose any.\n\n520\n00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.484\nAnd we now have that one MAC address.\n\n521\n00:30:07.484 --> 00:30:10.420\nAlright, so let us go ahead and\nturn this interface off, too.\n\n522\n00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:17.140\nAnd this will simulate\na failure of this interface.\n\n523\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.510\nSo, shutdown.\n\n524\n00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.500\nThat's where I wanted to get.\n\n525\n00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.900\nSo right at the beginning,\nwhy am I halfway through this already and\n\n526\n00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.779\nI didn't even realize it.\n\n527\n00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.780\nSo now that I've shut this down here,\nwe are seeing some different up downs,\n\n528\n00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.910\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n529\n00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.000\nLet me get back out.\n\n530\n00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.630\nLet's clear the port\nsecurity stuff that we have.\n\n531\n00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.370\nSo we're gonna do clear port.\n\n532\n00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.680\nSo we've set it up, which is fine.\n\n533\n00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.600\nClear port-security sticky at this point,\ntelling it to drop whatever it learned\n\n534\n00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.751\non the interface fa1/0/12.\n\n535\n00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:57.150\nGo for fast ethernet.\n\n536\n00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.610\nAnd now I've cleared that out,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n537\n00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:04.027\nLet's go back into the interface\nitself once again.\n\n538\n00:31:04.027 --> 00:31:07.658\nAnd now we are going to\nmanually assign an address,\n\n539\n00:31:07.658 --> 00:31:10.454\nand see what happens from here, okay?\n\n540\n00:31:10.454 --> 00:31:17.257\nSo switchport port-security MAC-address\n\n541\n00:31:17.257 --> 00:31:22.656\n0001.0001.0001.\n\n542\n00:31:22.656 --> 00:31:27.230\nSo this way, it's just as clear as\nwe can actually make it to do that.\n\n543\n00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:34.630\nAll right, now let's do a no shutdown,\nand turn this thing back on.\n\n544\n00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.400\nAnd hopefully get an UPDOWN here in\njust a moment or so, there we go.\n\n545\n00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.570\nSo that is a state that got changed.\n\n546\n00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.210\nLook at that.\n\n547\n00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.400\nThere we go, okay.\n\n548\n00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.510\nWe're starting to see\na couple of other things.\n\n549\n00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.950\nNotice that power was detected.\n\n550\n00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.120\nPower device detected.\n\n551\n00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.150\nPower granted here.\n\n552\n00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:58.040\nAnd we're seeing that the Line protocol\nand updown has actually occurred.\n\n553\n00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.740\nSo let's see what happened on this port.\n\n554\n00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.430\nSo those are some of the commands\nthat you're like what the heck is\n\n555\n00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.510\ngoing on here.\n\n556\n00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:13.010\nSo now we do a show port -security.\n\n557\n00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.018\nAnd then for interface, fa1/0/12.\n\n558\n00:32:20.365 --> 00:32:21.910\nAnd let's see.\n\n559\n00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:27.720\nAny violation that has happened at this\npoint is what we are expecting to see.\n\n560\n00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.370\nOkay.\n\n561\n00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.500\nSo, so far, it actually is saying\nthat device was granted here.\n\n562\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.460\nWe may have to give it\na little bit of time.\n\n563\n00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.970\nBecause I was hoping that it\nwould actually show up yet.\n\n564\n00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.050\nSo it may take just a little\nbit more time here.\n\n565\n00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.430\nBut it should be violating\nits port security as well.\n\n566\n00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.930\nSince I did set up my own MAC address, and\n\n567\n00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.500\nwhatever this power device\nwas that came up, it should.\n\n568\n00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.870\nThere we go.\nThat's what I was looking for.\n\n569\n00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.730\nI was like,\nit should just be a matter of time.\n\n570\n00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.930\nBut it's hard to wait.\n\n571\n00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.660\nIt's the impatience that I\nhave that we are seeing, so\n\n572\n00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.582\nhere it is, notice what it says.\n\n573\n00:33:02.582 --> 00:33:08.710\nERR disable, and\na notification message of four, okay?\n\n574\n00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.280\nFour right here means an error\nhas actually occurred,\n\n575\n00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.250\nwhich not really a good thing.\n\n576\n00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.395\nAnd you can see,\nhere is the terminology right?\n\n577\n00:33:16.395 --> 00:33:20.160\npsecure-violation-error has been detected.\n\n578\n00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.740\nAnd now on this particular port,\nit's been disabled.\n\n579\n00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.690\nIt has actually occurred, and you can see,\n\n580\n00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.520\ncaused by another MAC address,\nhas now been configured on this port.\n\n581\n00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.830\nWe manually configured\nour own MAC address, and\n\n582\n00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.580\nnow it tried to learn a new one,\nand that's what happened.\n\n583\n00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.250\nAll right, Zach.\n\n584\n00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.520\nNow on this one, okay,\nthere's still a few steps to go, but\n\n585\n00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.080\nI clearly out of time at this point.\n\n586\n00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.550\nSo, we'll have to save that for\na part two.\n\n587\n00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.360\n&gt;&gt; Configure and verify port security,\n\n588\n00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.890\nthere's gonna be a lot more, so\nyou want to make sure you see part two,\n\n589\n00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.090\nthis has been part one.\n\n590\n00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.160\nRonnie, anything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n591\n00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.270\nremember this is a little\nbit of an unusual lab right?\n\n592\n00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.960\nYou're actually seeing stuff then\nthat has to involve patience here.\n\n593\n00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.720\nBut this concept is one of the more\nimportant ones that you want to make sure\n\n594\n00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.350\nthat you get right,\nbecause of the steps that are involved.\n\n595\n00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.005\nMake sure you remember to practice\nthis over and over again.\n\n596\n00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:10.750\nCISCO C has some marvelous theories.\n\n597\n00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.340\nMake sure you watch every episode.\n\n598\n00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.480\nYou're going to be so glad you did,\nand you'll be in the course library,\n\n599\n00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.080\nwhere there's thousands of other\nvideos there to help you go further.\n\n600\n00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.350\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n601\n00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.430\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n602\n00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.540\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n603\n00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.877\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching,\n\n604\n00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:26.409\nand we'll see you soon.\n\n605\n00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:33.536\n[MUSIC]\n\n606\n00:34:33.536 --> 00:34:36.530\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:12.047\nwatching ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:16.278\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:21.048\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, and\nwe continue on with Cisco CCENT,\n\n9\n00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:24.720\nConfiguring Verified Port Security,\npart two.\n\n10\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.640\nAnd Ronnie Wong said,\n\n11\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.270\nhe'd help us out some more, didn't you,\ndidn't you, Ronnie, you said that?\n\n12\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.613\n&gt;&gt; I sure did, thank you, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:32.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For joining me once again as we take\n\n14\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.370\na look at the CCENT here, and of course,\nthe configuring port security.\n\n15\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.793\nWe've already went through the lab and\nwe've shown quite a bit of information.\n\n16\n00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:42.752\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n17\n00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:47.976\n&gt;&gt; Okay, being able to manually\nimplement port security is a big concept\n\n18\n00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:52.681\nin the LAN switching topic that\nyou'll see on the exam as well.\n\n19\n00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:55.670\nSo when you do the configuration,\nmake sure you pay attention.\n\n20\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.470\nWe'll review this at the end of\nthis episode, because there are so\n\n21\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.730\nmany moving parts that we have\nto think about as well, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.890\nBut let's finish up\nthe configuration that we need to,\n\n23\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.350\nas we showed you from part one.\n\n24\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.656\nIf you haven't been watching part one and\nyou jumped into part two,\n\n25\n00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:09.914\nI don't know why you did that first.\n\n26\n00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:12.057\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if that happens to be true,\n\n27\n00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:13.818\nmy recommendation-\n&gt;&gt; Go back, go back in time.\n\n28\n00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:16.515\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, make sure you go back-\n&gt;&gt; Rewind.\n\n29\n00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:17.750\n&gt;&gt; And watch in part one.\n\n30\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.010\nCuz you're probably saying,\nthat's unusual,\n\n31\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.852\nwhy would they end an episode like this?\n\n32\n00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:23.206\nOr have enough fill by this,\ncuz this is the part two.\n\n33\n00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:27.820\nSo let's pick up where we left off, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.870\nWe had just finished\nconfiguring port security and\n\n35\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.040\nI was there kind of nervously like\nthis thing should be working.\n\n36\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.462\nBut it's just a matter of time and\npatience here,\n\n37\n00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.199\nwhich is never good on air, right?\n\n38\n00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:39.137\nDead time when you're like, okay.\n\n39\n00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:42.518\nHopefully it works, and\nas soon as I was about ready to go,\n\n40\n00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:45.419\nwe're going to have to cut this and\ngo it happens.\n\n41\n00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.260\nWell, it magically appeared.\n\n42\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.760\nSo here's some of the information\nthat we end up seeing, right?\n\n43\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.620\nThe very fact is that once we violated it,\nby a long to learn\n\n44\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.397\nof a new MAC address compared\nto the one we configured on.\n\n45\n00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:03.573\nBut this is the syslog\nmessages that we start to get.\n\n46\n00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.772\nERR_DISABLE is kinda the key here, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:08.933\nIs that we get out from syslog and\n\n48\n00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:14.780\nwhat essentially really happens is what\nwe call a key secure violation, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.500\nAnd that is a clear indication that port\nsecure, a violation has actually occurred.\n\n50\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.540\nThen we get another one that really\ndoes define what that means.\n\n51\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.640\nSo PSECURE_VIOLATION,\nSecurity violation occurred and\n\n52\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.950\nit said it was caused by this MAC address.\n\n53\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.977\nAnd the reason it was caused by the MAC\naddress right here that you're seeing,\n\n54\n00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:44.938\nis that I've configured this port\nwith a MAC address of 0001.0001.0001.\n\n55\n00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:47.071\nSo when we turn the port back on,\n\n56\n00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.291\nthis is the MAC address it tried to learn-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n57\n00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:54.038\n&gt;&gt; He was in violation to\nthe one that I had set, and\n\n58\n00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:58.350\nfrom that point when it did\nthat violation, it went and\n\n59\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.120\nactually took a look at\nthe idea of the violation mode.\n\n60\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.859\nAnd it shut the port down, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.560\nIs what we did here, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.880\nSo now that this port is shut down\nin a way that we have it, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.030\nThis is where we have to kind of take a\nlittle bit more here, and see the output.\n\n64\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.666\nAnd normally, when a port is not working,\n\n65\n00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:27.831\nwe begin by troubleshooting and\ndoing show interface fa1/0/12.\n\n66\n00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:31.340\nI'm just doing the abbreviation,\ncuz it's easier for me to be able to type.\n\n67\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.910\nAnd I want you to note a couple\nof different things, and\n\n68\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.870\nthe first line is essentially right there,\nokay?\n\n69\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.857\nWhenever you see the name errdisable.\n\n70\n00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:47.610\nerrdislable for you and me, and\neveryone else on this planet, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.520\nMake sure you key this\nconcept into your brain.\n\n72\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.032\nAny time it says that, it's not going\nto recover from the error, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:56.032 --> 00:03:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It is not going to recover from\n\n74\n00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.660\nthe error.\n\n75\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.100\nAnd what that means is that you now\nas a Cisco Engineer in your career,\n\n76\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.730\nyou're gonna have to find\nout what the issue is.\n\n77\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.520\nThe great thing is we're\ntold what the issue is, so\n\n78\n00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.720\nwe have to actually be able to fix that.\n\n79\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.560\nOnce we fix it,\nthe port though is in shut down.\n\n80\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.730\nWhich means it was manually or\nadministratively shut down here, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.959\nSo let me verify that for you too.\n\n82\n00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:27.324\nShow IP interface brief, and\n\n83\n00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:32.742\nwe are looking for fa0/12 here.\n\n84\n00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:35.100\nI was hoping that it would actually\nsay it right here, but it didn't.\n\n85\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.946\nI was hoping that the status would\nactually say, administratively shut down,\n\n86\n00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:38.550\nbut it wasn't.\n\n87\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.160\nIt just says down, down.\n\n88\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.309\nSo I don't know why I thought it was\ngonna say administratively shut down, but\n\n89\n00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.083\nI sure as heck did.\n\n90\n00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:47.023\nSo that port is now down.\n\n91\n00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:48.422\nA lot of times when you just see that,\n\n92\n00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:51.170\nand actually probably that was\nwhat my mind was thinking.\n\n93\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.979\nIf you see this, it normally means that\nthe port is actually gonna be able to\n\n94\n00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.197\nrecover at some point.\n\n95\n00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:58.958\nIn other words, if there's\na configuration changed somewhere or\n\n96\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.051\nyou mistyped something.\n\n97\n00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:02.709\nAll you have to do is type it back\nin fine, and you'll be ready to go.\n\n98\n00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:03.247\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n99\n00:05:03.247 --> 00:05:07.863\n&gt;&gt; But on err-disabled, even that,\neven after you fix it, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.039\nIt's still gonna remain shut down.\n\n101\n00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:15.040\nThe only way for you then at that point\nto make sure that you do fix it, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.450\nIs going to have to be going\nback in that interface and\n\n103\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.790\nissuing the shut down command\nto administratively turn it off.\n\n104\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.700\nAnd then a no shut down\nto turn it back on.\n\n105\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.488\nSo all that is kind of as a way of\nreview of what we just did in part one,\n\n106\n00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:32.320\ncuz that's important to make\nsure that we go over that, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.420\nSo now that we have that flicker\ninterface in that or disabled here.\n\n108\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.500\nLet's take a look at show errdisable and\n\n109\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.300\nthis is kind of the hard one,\ncuz usually I think\n\n110\n00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.225\nabout a dash in between,\nerrdisable recovery.\n\n111\n00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.932\nerrdisable recovery, what I am looking for\n\n112\n00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:57.250\nover here on the left hand side\nis psecure-violation, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.350\nIt is disabled at this particular point.\n\n114\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.060\nSo that means automatic recovery\nis not gonnabe happening and\n\n115\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.090\nthat is because that's what\nerrdisable does for us.\n\n116\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.560\nIt does not allow for\nany automatic configuration here.\n\n117\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.390\nThis will hold the timer for about 300\nseconds and about 5 minutes for us.\n\n118\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.087\nAnd it says, usually at that point,\ninterfaces that will be enabled which\n\n119\n00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:24.279\npsecure is not gonna be enabled here,\nit will go ahead and do that.\n\n120\n00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.771\nBut on all this, what we actually\nsee right here is the psecure and\n\n121\n00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:29.600\nthe security violation.\n\n122\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.240\nThis is disabled where that recovery\nis not gonna end up happening, for\n\n123\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.010\nwhat we want it to do.\n\n124\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.569\nSo once we get this, okay, now we can type\nin another command, to show us a little\n\n125\n00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.275\nbit more or to actually kind of\nconfigure this differently here.\n\n126\n00:06:43.275 --> 00:06:49.211\nSo we're gonna go into our\nglobal configuration mode,\n\n127\n00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:56.970\nand once I'm in here, I can do\nan errdisable recovery costs, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.021\nNow, once I do that, right?\n\n129\n00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:01.650\nIt is saying, hey,\nwhat is the recovery cause?\n\n130\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.481\nSo now if I look for that psecure,\nI can instead say, hey,\n\n131\n00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:13.101\ninstead of just doing that violation,\nenable a timer to recover if I choose to.\n\n132\n00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.960\nSo if I don't do that,\nthe default is shut down.\n\n133\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.390\nDo not allow anything to happen until\nsomebody administratively turns it on.\n\n134\n00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.035\nFor us though,\nit even gives us this option instead,\n\n135\n00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:28.832\nif I can keep this in frame here.\n\n136\n00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:35.580\nSo errdisable recovery cause, and\nwe are going to do psecure violation.\n\n137\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.487\nSo we are gonna change this to where\n\n138\n00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:45.573\nwe can enable the idea of recovery.\n\n139\n00:07:45.573 --> 00:07:52.920\npsecure-violation, just wanna make sure,\nI'll do that.\n\n140\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.853\nI knew I was gonna do that,\n\n141\n00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:55.941\nI was gonna say there is\nsomething that's not gonna work.\n\n142\n00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:57.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can feel it.\n\n143\n00:07:57.688 --> 00:08:03.748\nWell, so make sure errdisable recovery\n\n144\n00:08:03.748 --> 00:08:09.460\ncause is gonna be psecure violation.\n\n145\n00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:19.432\nThen it's gonna be errdisable, so notice\nthis is two lines in the configuration.\n\n146\n00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:23.438\nerrdisable recovery interval, so\n\n147\n00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:32.125\nnow I'm setting the interval in terms\nof seconds here which is 30 seconds.\n\n148\n00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.320\nAll right, so now it should say,\nhey, look even if this happens,\n\n149\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.419\nyou can try and make it recover\nafter 30 seconds if you want to.\n\n150\n00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.503\nSo this is a lot more configuration.\n\n151\n00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:42.609\nMost of the time, I would not do this.\n\n152\n00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:46.438\nIf I implemented shut down as\na violation on purpose, I mean for\n\n153\n00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:50.556\nthem to come to me and tell me\nsomething has happened to my computer,\n\n154\n00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:53.541\nI want to go and\nfigure out what's going on here.\n\n155\n00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:57.890\nBecause normally, it means somebody is\nviolating it, and they don't realize it.\n\n156\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.794\nSo I need to at least be able to go in and\nfigure out what's happening.\n\n157\n00:09:00.794 --> 00:09:04.114\nCuz if you don't want to be\nbothered by it, here's what you do.\n\n158\n00:09:04.114 --> 00:09:09.528\nSo once we're here, now we can\n\n159\n00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:15.162\ndo a show errdisable recovery.\n\n160\n00:09:15.162 --> 00:09:20.180\nAnd now you can see where it actually is\nthe security violation is now enabled.\n\n161\n00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.810\nNow, that doesn't mean it\nfixes the problem for you.\n\n162\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.300\nOkay, that's the key.\n\n163\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.080\nSo what you would normally do at\nthis point is you would have to fix\n\n164\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.140\nthe problem.\n\n165\n00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.774\nSo I do a show port-security\nint fa1/12 here,\n\n166\n00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:38.747\nlet's take a look at what\nthe port security is, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:42.150\nSo now on the port security here,\nlet's see,\n\n168\n00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.389\ndid it actually bring it back up yet,\nokay?\n\n169\n00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:46.794\nWell yeah, it actually did.\n\n170\n00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:49.896\nSo it did end up recovering,\nso that's fine.\n\n171\n00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:52.732\nSo we can actually have\nit now where secure up.\n\n172\n00:09:52.732 --> 00:09:55.529\nSo this one ended up actually doing that.\n\n173\n00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:58.571\nAnd now everything is back up and running.\n\n174\n00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:02.245\nSo you're seeing kind of\na full configuration.\n\n175\n00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:02.786\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a full thing.\n\n176\n00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:04.130\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.430\nFor me, I would as much as I don't\nlike to go and have to do this.\n\n178\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:14.490\nI wanted to know when violations occur and\neven though this is probably easier option\n\n179\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.380\nin real production LAN, I would probably\ntry to have a hard time doing this.\n\n180\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.570\nNow if there is 1,000 computers, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.152\nLet's say 50, I may consider this because\nI don't wanna get interrupted every time\n\n182\n00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:30.376\nsomebody accidentally plugs in the wrong\ndevice in the wrong port all the time.\n\n183\n00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:31.730\nAnd I want it to be able to do this.\n\n184\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.633\nAnd now, look at that, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:38.860\nSo you're actually seeing where it's\nviolating it again, that's kind of weird.\n\n186\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.190\nSo it didn't actually fix it.\n\n187\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.420\nSo it brought it back up here,\njust for a moment.\n\n188\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.950\nBut you see where it went ahead and\ndisabled it once again.\n\n189\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.132\nSo that's funny,\nbecause I didn't fix the original here.\n\n190\n00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:49.759\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n191\n00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:53.038\n&gt;&gt; So it's going through it says,\nhey, I'm enabled to come back up.\n\n192\n00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:56.341\nSo it's up, I'm now recognizing\na violation has happened, and so\n\n193\n00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:59.345\nthere look it's actually starting again-\n&gt;&gt; The violation loop.\n\n194\n00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually in a loop here.\n\n195\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.530\nSo it's actually gonna bring it up and\ndown till I fix that loop again, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.350\nSo that is kind of the stuff that we\nreally wanted to make sure that we got\n\n197\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.830\nthrough here for\nthe idea of port security, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.993\nNow, let's just review basically\nsome of the configurations stuff,\n\n199\n00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:19.757\nbecause it is absolutely important.\n\n200\n00:11:19.757 --> 00:11:22.647\nLet me see if I can scroll all\nthe way to the point where I want.\n\n201\n00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:23.974\nYeah, that's it, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:30.540\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at this, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.010\nRemember that what we wanna do here,\nwe then show everything, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.780\nRight above this,\nthis first line here, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.540\nAnd word it is, switchport mode access\ncuz we only do it on access ports, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.570\nThen we define our port security\nbased on a MAC address.\n\n207\n00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.870\nThat we have learned that we want it\nto be persistent through reboots.\n\n208\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:57.040\nWe also here have defined a maximum\nof only one MAC address on this port,\n\n209\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.470\nwhich is fine.\n\n210\n00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.080\nAnd then we chose the different\nmode of violation.\n\n211\n00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.850\nSo which one are you going to do?\n\n212\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.710\nMake sure you know about those.\n\n213\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.852\nYeah, it's still in violation.\n\n214\n00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:12.896\nIt's still kicking me back out here to\ntell me that, hey, it's violated, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:12.896 --> 00:12:15.140\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat all that is done.\n\n216\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.016\nAnd then at the end,\nthe switch port port-security enables it\n\n217\n00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:23.697\non that interface is what has to happen,\nokay?\n\n218\n00:12:23.697 --> 00:12:26.500\nSo all that, what we're actually seeing,\n\n219\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.851\nis what we want to make sure\nthat we can review and do.\n\n220\n00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:31.744\nSo make sure you understand that.\n\n221\n00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:34.604\nPractice this particular lab over.\n\n222\n00:12:34.604 --> 00:12:38.820\nBecause there's nothing that you are going\nto do that's gonna make this sink in more,\n\n223\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.880\nthan realizing what is happening\nwhen you violate the security, and\n\n224\n00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.440\nseeing some of the show interfaces.\n\n225\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.990\nSo very important, the show commands that\nwe've been doing throughout the entire\n\n226\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.710\nshow and for this lab as well,\nyou need to pay attention.\n\n227\n00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.610\nThose different show commands that\nshows you the information and\n\n228\n00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:04.570\nnot just rely on show running-config to\nshow you everything that you need to know.\n\n229\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.560\nBecause you will not get some of that\noptions, especially on getting ready for\n\n230\n00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.600\nthe exam.\n\n231\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.620\nSo do not depend on it if\nyou don't have to, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.240\nUse it for\n\n233\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.280\nverification do not use it to depend\non you getting the right information.\n\n234\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.984\nMake sure you practice these\ndifferent show commands,\n\n235\n00:13:21.984 --> 00:13:24.750\nthey will be testable on the exam for you.\n\n236\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.318\n&gt;&gt; Figure verified port security part two\nmake sure you see part one; very important\n\n237\n00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:30.855\nthat you see part one.\n\n238\n00:13:30.855 --> 00:13:33.600\nRonnie, anything else you'd\nlike to say before we go on?\n\n239\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.351\n&gt;&gt; Like everything else, right?\n\n240\n00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:36.925\nTake the time right now.\n\n241\n00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:42.310\nIf this is the concept that is bothering\nyou in terms of moving on, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.694\nIf you're going man\nthat's really confusing,\n\n243\n00:13:44.694 --> 00:13:46.852\nthe only thing that you\ncan do at this point.\n\n244\n00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:49.632\nAs we're now getting into concepts\nthat really aren’t as intuitive as\n\n245\n00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:51.520\nyou think that they should be.\n\n246\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.600\nYou must slow down.\n\n247\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.688\nEverybody wants to get on track to face\nthat exam, to do what they need to do, and\n\n248\n00:13:57.688 --> 00:13:59.100\nI want to do the same thing.\n\n249\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.480\nBut it's not going to help you if you\nwalk into the exam and you're not ready.\n\n250\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.420\nIn other words, you don't have\nconfidence in any topic that\n\n251\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.130\nyou're seeing on the exam objective list.\n\n252\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.270\nAny particular topic that you\ndon't have confidence in,\n\n253\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.930\nespecially up in this point, right?\n\n254\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.520\nThrough domain objectives one and\ntwo, it is now time for\n\n255\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.150\nyou to slow down,\nreview those concepts again, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.230\nAnd make sure you hammer them down\nuntil you say that you're good.\n\n257\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.730\nOnce you're good with those concepts, then\nmove on to the next domain objectives that\n\n258\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.520\nyou need to do and continue on forward.\n\n259\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.690\nBut don't hack it all up and then at\nthe end go realize that there's five or\n\n260\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.730\nsix different concept\nyou don't understand.\n\n261\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.750\nMake sure you take the time on\nthe most difficult of these concepts\n\n262\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.120\nto get the fundamentals of the mastered.\n\n263\n00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.560\nSo that they are not gonna bother\nyou on the exam day, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.670\nYou don't have the time to try and\nfigure it out on the exam.\n\n265\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.893\nIt's not gonna help you out at that point.\n\n266\n00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:01.180\nSo review those hard topics.\n\n267\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:07.680\nOn this one as these configurations become\nmore and more complex, slow down as much\n\n268\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.010\nas you don't want to slow down, understand\nwhat it is that you are typing in.\n\n269\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.989\nUnderstand what each concept or\neach particular command is going for you.\n\n270\n00:15:15.989 --> 00:15:19.022\nAnd that's the key to getting through and\ngetting ready for the exam.\n\n271\n00:15:19.022 --> 00:15:22.017\n&gt;&gt;

They also describe the changing fo the layer 2 protocol at each hop is known as frame rewrite.",

describing,\n\n8\n00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:24.715\nrouting concept in the present\nbring us the information we need.\n\n9\n00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:26.040\nIt's the one and only Ronnie

00:00:33.330\nZack right here on the show as\nwe journey through together.\n\n13\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.220\nWe are now into that realm\nof course basic routing.\n\n14\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.940\nWe need to understand some of the ideas of\nthe routing concepts as we get started and\n\n15\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.750\nworking with Cisco routers.\n\n16\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.680\nSo our goal today of course is to\nmake sure you have an understanding.\n\n17\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.546\nOf how data actually does move from\nthe actual source device that we have.\n\n18\n00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:57.408\nAll the way through to\nits destination device.\n\n19\n00:00:57.408 --> 00:00:59.507\nAnd the ins and outs of that too.\n\n20\n00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:03.260\nNow we're gonna describe the process and\nit is a detailed process.\n\n21\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.563\nBut for you, it is just understanding what\nhappens at device that it comes across.\n\n22\n00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:11.007\nSo that we understand what happens and\nwe'll show you that.\n\n23\n00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.760\nWe'll kind of describe that\nprocess as we walk through it.\n\n24\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.230\nAnd then make sure that you\nhave a good understanding.\n\n25\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.290\nAnd once we do that then we can jump\ninto the idea of actually routing and\n\n26\n00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.750\nhow that works instead.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n27\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.980\npacket handling would be part of that.\n&gt;&gt; That is it, so\n\n28\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.900\nfor today right,\nour goal is to actually see.\n\n29\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.770\nHow does a packet traverse through?\n\n30\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.008\nWell, networks-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n31\n00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.576\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] want to be able to do.\n\n32\n00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:35.170\nSo that way,\nwe can understand what happens, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.650\nSo in this,\nwe're gonna be using, of course,\n\n34\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.760\nsimple diagrams to help us out\nconceptually, as we see this.\n\n35\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.410\nBut if you can keep these steps in\nyour mind, it's gonna help you out.\n\n36\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.860\nNow one of the basic things that\nreally helps you out at the beginning,\n\n37\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.790\nright, Is you focusing\nin on the OSI model.\n\n38\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.040\nYou might not think so\nas you began this series and\n\n39\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.560\nstarted learning about the OSI model.\n\n40\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.780\nYou might still think, that's a bunch\nof fluff, I don't have to worry about,\n\n41\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.690\nI'll never use it.\n&gt;&gt; Well this is used every day\n\n42\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.580\nin networking and is used in every\n&gt;&gt; Part of making sure that a pocket or\n\n43\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.080\ndata is delivered from its source device\nall the way through to the end device.\n\n44\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.790\nAnd you and\n\n45\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.010\nI are gonna see how that breaks down how\nit works through this entire process.\n\n46\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.600\nAnd I'm gonna show you step\nby step how that works.\n\n47\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.000\nSo take a look at my screen\nas we get started here, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.660\nWe're gonna start up with\nthe very simple diagram here.\n\n49\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.560\nTo allow us to illustrate the purpose and\nwe're gonna focus in device by device.\n\n50\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.690\nAnd understand what happens as it\ngoes through as we start seeing it.\n\n51\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.710\nNow I've summarized some of\nthe stuff that happens here.\n\n52\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.610\nSo that we can keep track of it.\n\n53\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.130\nBut just remember this is a very\ndetailed process as we go through,\n\n54\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.720\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n55\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.950\n&gt;&gt; So let's start off with a sending\n\n56\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.270\ndevice on PC1.\n\n57\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.930\nThere of course is an IP\naddress on this device as well.\n\n58\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.290\nBut let's say that what we want to\ndo is to send something like a ping.\n\n59\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.617\nLet's just use a ping for\nexample from PC 01,\n\n60\n00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.981\nall the way through SRV01 as well.\n\n61\n00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:06.624\nWell notice that we have\na router in the middle and\n\n62\n00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:09.280\nthat separates two broadcast domains.\n\n63\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.280\nThe one over here on the left,\n192.168.12 is the network.\n\n64\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.405\nAnd then there's another network\nover here on the right hand side.\n\n65\n00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:17.980\n172.16.23.\n\n66\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800\nThat's the network.\n\n67\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.220\nSo we are traversing a single\nrouter at this point, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.480\nAs we do this.\n\n69\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.530\nSo I want to know how a ping makes it\nfrom PC01 All way through another device,\n\n70\n00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.890\nall way through SRV01 as well, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.840\nThat's the goal here, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.000\nSo when it's starts off,\nwhen we start in on PC01, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.470\nThe idea of you and\n\n74\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.430\nI bringing up either the command\nprompt on a Windows machine or.\n\n75\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.260\nA terminal on any other machines\nthat's out there, right?\n\n76\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.400\nWe type in ping, you and\nI start off in the application layer\n\n77\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.160\nof the OSI mod okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n78\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.490\n&gt;&gt; We're following TCP-IP\n\n79\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.640\nas the aplication layer anyways, right.\n\n80\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.280\nSo once we do that, then we also\ndecide on that particular protocol.\n\n81\n00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.110\nPING is part of the ICMP protocol,\nas well.\n\n82\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.790\nAnd has also, of course,\nworked for us, right?\n\n83\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.770\nMore specifically, what we call\nan echo reply is what it's requesting.\n\n84\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.650\nSo we're not actually telling it, hey,\n\n85\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.920\njust send something\nover to the other side.\n\n86\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.550\nWe're saying, what we want is once data\ncomes from me, Get over to the other side.\n\n87\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.980\nBut I'm asking for\na reply to come back in return.\n\n88\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.480\nSo that's the entire process\nthat we're talking about.\n\n89\n00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.640\nNow when we do that, remember that\nwhen we take a look at the OSI model.\n\n90\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.710\nWe have now encapsulated the data all the\nway through layer 4, the transport layer.\n\n91\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.190\nWe have now decided to use ping and\nasked for an echo reply.\n\n92\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.560\nSo now we have that layer four PDU.\n\n93\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.320\nAnd once we're are at that point we\nnow actually when we type in ping.\n\n94\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.950\nNow we put in the protocol or where\nit's going to which is the destination\n\n95\n00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.790\nIP address.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n96\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.790\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\n\n97\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.710\nlet's take a look here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.300\nSo on PC1 it will say I\nwant to ping 172.16.23.2.\n\n99\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.355\nSo as I issue that out\n\n100\n00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:16.110\nthat means that PC01 will\nthen drop down into layer 3.\n\n101\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.748\nAnd add in what, the header,\nthe source IP address,\n\n102\n00:05:20.748 --> 00:05:23.930\nwhich is 192.168.12.10.\n\n103\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.933\nAs well as the destination IP address,\n172.16.23.2.\n\n104\n00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.820\nAnd that's what it'll do\nat that layer header.\n\n105\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.998\nNow, Zach, at this point,\nyou might think that the data is now\n\n106\n00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:44.194\nready to be transmitted across\nout of PC one Across router one.\n\n107\n00:05:44.194 --> 00:05:46.890\nAnd then the server of zero one over here.\n\n108\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.220\nBut we are not ready yet.\n\n109\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.990\nAnd that is because, even that layer\nthree where we have a packet formed.\n\n110\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.820\nThe data is not ready to\nbe out out unto the wire.\n\n111\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.620\nWhat we now need, right,\nis because I have the device in-between.\n\n112\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.500\nThat I need to make sure that my\ndata can actually go from PC one,\n\n113\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.750\nget over to router one.\n\n114\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.120\nAnd then router one knows how to\ndeliver it over to SRV1 as well.\n\n115\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.020\nSo what we do is after we have\nthe layer three header on it.\n\n116\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.770\nNow we go to layer two and that's\nwhere the magic for you and I begins.\n\n117\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.680\nIn this entire process of the delivery,\nyou and\n\n118\n00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.830\nI will not see the layer 3 header change.\n\n119\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.043\nIn other words, the source IP and\nthe desk IP address.\n\n120\n00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:37.410\nIt will remain the same\nthroughout the whole process.\n\n121\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.580\nBut at layer 2 though,\n\n122\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.080\nthis is where we add in the Mac\naddress as a source of PC01.\n\n123\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.040\nBut I cannot add in\nthe mac address of SRV01.\n\n124\n00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.910\nIt cannot be done.\n\n125\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.950\nThe reason why is that when we actually\ntalked about mac address season.\n\n126\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.220\nThey are really only done in broadcast\n\n127\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.460\nto be able to discover other\nmac addresses on our network.\n\n128\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.610\nSo even though I have\nthe destination IP address.\n\n129\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.190\nI need to discover the Mac address\nthat will get me over to SRV01.\n\n130\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.030\nAnd what we use at that point\nis a protocol that we call ARP.\n\n131\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:23.470\nARP says, I have the destination\nIP address 172.16.23.2.\n\n132\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.100\nWhat is the mac address?\n\n133\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.870\nWell, when it does that over here\non the left hand side of router 1.\n\n134\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.860\nIt essentially puts it on to\nthe broadcast network over here.\n\n135\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.590\nOkay, in that entire broadcast network\nit actually can do a couple of things.\n\n136\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.490\nNow before it even does that,\nokay, What it will first do.\n\n137\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.580\nAnd this is what I need to remind you\nbecause I always forget this step.\n\n138\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.616\nOn PC1 it will ask okay do I have\nthe MAC address to 1721623.2.\n\n139\n00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:53.130\nIt will look it up in this ARP table.\n\n140\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.704\nIt will do an ARP lookup in\nits own MAC address table.\n\n141\n00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:59.139\nAnd if it doesn't find it,\nit goes okay I can't find it.\n\n142\n00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.419\nThat's when it will do\na broadcast Who has or\n\n143\n00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.907\nwho is 172.16.23.2.\n\n144\n00:08:07.907 --> 00:08:10.963\nNow, that's where it gets\na little bit trickier,\n\n145\n00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:15.593\nbecause it's expecting reply to come\nback and say, that's my MAC address.\n\n146\n00:08:15.593 --> 00:08:18.870\nBut the problem is,\nit's on a different network.\n\n147\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.740\nSo no one else is going to reply to that.\n\n148\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.670\nExcept for one device, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.690\nThe entire network of all\nthe other devices out there,\n\n150\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.440\nwhen it sees that it doesn't\nhave that MAC address,\n\n151\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.660\nit will simply drop all the packets,\nis what will end up happening.\n\n152\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:41.000\nBut there is one device that will answer,\nand that is router one.\n\n153\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.420\nRouter one on this interface,\nit will hear that art broadcast,\n\n154\n00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.310\nand it will instead send\nwhat's called a proxy ARP out.\n\n155\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.350\nA proxy ARP says look,\nthe address you're looking for\n\n156\n00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.750\nisn't on this network, but\nI bet I can get it there.\n\n157\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.262\nSo why don't you put my MAC\naddress on that layer to header\n\n158\n00:09:04.262 --> 00:09:06.614\nas the destination instead?\n\n159\n00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:12.374\nSo when it sends that back out,\nthis device's ARP reply will say,\n\n160\n00:09:12.374 --> 00:09:18.040\nit says that 19216812.1,\nit has actually masked itself.\n\n161\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.620\nAnd said no, I reply as this guy.\n\n162\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.780\nAnd so now PC 1 in layer 2,\nIt goes ahead and\n\n163\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.120\nit changes its MAC address,\nthe destination to this.\n\n164\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.739\nTo this interface right here.\n\n165\n00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:36.707\nNow, the way that it does that, right,\nis instead it actually takes a look and\n\n166\n00:09:36.707 --> 00:09:39.869\nit goes look,\nit's not really that MAC address,\n\n167\n00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:45.270\nit's not on this network, so I will\ninstead send it to this default gateway.\n\n168\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.620\nWhich is saying that I can\naccept all those address,\n\n169\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.370\nand that's what that\nproxy ARP is all about.\n\n170\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.870\nSo what it does is it says, if it's not\non this network, let me go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.430\nsend it towards this default gateway.\n\n172\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.880\nAnd what it does there,\nis that's what the proxy ARP does.\n\n173\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.278\nIt says that MAC address,\nI'll take anybody else.\n\n174\n00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:06.420\nAll the IP addresses that are not on\nthis network, I'll answer for them.\n\n175\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.770\nSo that's when,\nnow it gets put out onto the wire, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.570\nNow, when it actually gets\nput out onto the wire, and\n\n177\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.790\nit begins to go towards router one, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.719\nWell, it will then, of course,\nhave two things that it has to do.\n\n179\n00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:26.510\nLet me see if I can get\neverything kinda moved up here so\n\n180\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.750\nthat we can see it just\na little bit better.\n\n181\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.350\nSo, on router one you will\nnow receive the actual frame.\n\n182\n00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.340\nWhen it does that, it will go ahead and\n\n183\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.130\nit will take a look at the layer\ntwo frame, and it will process it.\n\n184\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.130\nIt goes,\nhey look that station MAC address,\n\n185\n00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.780\nthat's my interface,\nlet me process layer two, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:55.656\nSo if processes at layer two, then it\nhas to begin looking at layer three.\n\n187\n00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:59.302\nNow the problem is, on layer three,\n\n188\n00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:03.663\nthe address is still 1721623.2.\n\n189\n00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.273\nIt's not the same as\nthis address right here.\n\n190\n00:11:07.273 --> 00:11:10.820\nWhen it does that,\nthen you have a problem, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.310\nWhen it inspects the idea of the IP\naddress here, because that's not for me.\n\n192\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.220\nWell, inside of your own IP network,\nif that actually got to that point,\n\n193\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.960\nit would just drop the frame.\n\n194\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.268\nIt would just go, okay, it does not belong\nto me, I don't care about it anymore.\n\n195\n00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:28.250\nBut routers are different.\n\n196\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.600\nRouters, instead, will say hey,\nlook, that's not for me.\n\n197\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.950\nI have a routing table that\nI can do a route look up to.\n\n198\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.940\nAnd I might have where that particular\npacket or that frame is supposed to go,\n\n199\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.130\na packet at this point,\nwhere that packet is supposed to go.\n\n200\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.980\nAnd if it finds a match in doing the route\nlook up, it will then forward it\n\n201\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.950\nout to that exiting interface that\nit knows it can get towards or\n\n202\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.750\ncloser to that destination IP address,\nokay?\n\n203\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.456\nBut, if it looks up in\nthe routing table and\n\n204\n00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:07.640\ngoes, it doesn't match anything in this,\nokay?\n\n205\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.110\nThere's one of two possibilities here.\n\n206\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.641\nNotice it says, I have here,\nit says packets are dropped and\n\n207\n00:12:13.641 --> 00:12:16.216\nthen ICMP messages sent\nback to the source.\n\n208\n00:12:16.216 --> 00:12:19.711\nIn other words they will send back a\nmessage to PCO 1 saying, I don't have any,\n\n209\n00:12:19.711 --> 00:12:22.705\nI don't know where that is so\nI'm not gonna even pick it up anymore.\n\n210\n00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:26.433\nOkay, so it just drops it but it sends\nback a message letting me know the frame\n\n211\n00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:29.424\nwas somehow dropped,\nit's not gonna forward it on, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:34.789\nThe other possibility though, right,\nis that if the routing table is already\n\n213\n00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:40.659\nconfigured, okay, with another IP address\non it called the gateway of last resort.\n\n214\n00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:45.062\nAnd if the gateway of last resort is out,\nit's saying, well, if I don't have\n\n215\n00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:49.200\na match in my routing table, I'm just\ngonna dump it out this interface and\n\n216\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.940\nlet it find it from that device instead.\n\n217\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.510\nI'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n218\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.330\nSo it actually depends on\na configuration of what happens.\n\n219\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.120\nIf we don't have that set up and\nit's not set up by default, right,\n\n220\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.057\nit would simply drop it and\nthen send back a message.\n\n221\n00:13:03.057 --> 00:13:07.525\nBut in our case, let's say that we\nknow where the ping is supposed to go,\n\n222\n00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:12.219\nwhich is 17216.23.2,\nthe router knows about networks that it is\n\n223\n00:13:12.219 --> 00:13:17.870\ndirectly connected to, which is over here\non the left and over here on the right.\n\n224\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.590\nIt simply forwards it through\nfrom the interface on the left\n\n225\n00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:27.411\nover into a buffer on the interface\nexiting over on the right hand side.\n\n226\n00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.470\nOnce the packet is now inside of\nthat exiting interface's buffer,\n\n227\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.640\nthis is where a couple\nof things happen again.\n\n228\n00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.920\nIt now works like the PC does, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.371\nIt takes a look and says, all right, let\nme see if I can find this device again.\n\n230\n00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:49.510\nWho is 172.16.23.2?\n\n231\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.084\nIt can actually issue that out.\n\n232\n00:13:51.084 --> 00:13:54.620\nBut before it does it,\nit's gonna look in its own ARP cache.\n\n233\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.740\nAnd it finds it in its ARP cache,\n\n234\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.040\nthis is where we get into what\nis called a frame rewrite.\n\n235\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.040\nA frame rewrite says, look,\nI know that this IP address and\n\n236\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.540\nthis MAC address matches up.\n\n237\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.490\nI know exactly that's what happens here.\n\n238\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:17.340\nSo when it does that,\nit will then put a new layer two frame on,\n\n239\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:23.250\nthis time with the source MAC address as\nbeing this interface right here, okay?\n\n240\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.390\nAnd then the destination MAC address\nof being the interface over on SRV01.\n\n241\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.279\nIf it doesn't match at that point though,\nokay, then it will instead go,\n\n242\n00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.704\nlook, I don't find it in my ARP table.\n\n243\n00:14:35.704 --> 00:14:41.130\nLet me go and issue out an ARP, and\nit waits for a reply to come back, okay.\n\n244\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.210\nIn our instance here,\nit will actually get one of two things.\n\n245\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.850\nIf it does an ARP and there's another\nrouter in between, that other router will\n\n246\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.340\ngo, I'm doing a proxy ARP,\njust go ahead and send it on to me and\n\n247\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.570\nI'll take care of it, because I believe\nI know where that's going, okay.\n\n248\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.560\nBut if it doesn't match,\nright, and it doesn't do that,\n\n249\n00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.030\nwell then at that point that's when\nyou actually start seeing that.\n\n250\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:09.180\nSo here on that one, you actually end up\ngetting forwarded over to a new address\n\n251\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.970\nif it gets it, but\nif nothing's replying at that point\n\n252\n00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.070\nit will probably drop the packet as\nwell as timeout after awhile, all right.\n\n253\n00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.560\nSo through these two devices,\nthat's what happens.\n\n254\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.990\nUltimately, the frame then, after actually\nrewrites the layered two letters,\n\n255\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.950\nto include in the MAC address\nof this exiting interface, and\n\n256\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.540\nof the receiving interface over here,\nit will then send it out.\n\n257\n00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.890\nAnd now when R01 sends out the frame,\nthe frame is gonna be received.\n\n258\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.310\nAnd on SRV01 it just has to check\nagain in that layer two header.\n\n259\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.950\nIf it matches, then it processes it and\nbegins to work at layer three here,\n\n260\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.173\nlooking for the proper IP address.\n\n261\n00:15:50.173 --> 00:15:54.426\nBut if it's not there,\nthis will actually drop it, and\n\n262\n00:15:54.426 --> 00:16:00.774\nthen also send back an ICMP message along\nthis path going all the way back to PC01.\n\n263\n00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:06.369\nSo now, if it matches ICMP says,\nsend an echo reply back.\n\n264\n00:16:06.369 --> 00:16:10.110\nAnd the process essentially starts,\nand it reverses itself.\n\n265\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.879\nAnd goes through the entire same\nprocess all the way back here to get\n\n266\n00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:16.678\nall the way back to PC1.\n\n267\n00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:19.200\nNow just explaining that concept, right?\n\n268\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.840\nAgain, take it step by step.\n\n269\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.970\nAnd now you start seeing it's a pretty\ncomplicated process to just get it from\n\n270\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.830\nthis interface to this interface,\nacross to another interface, and\n\n271\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.990\nthen into another one.\n\n272\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.880\nThat's pretty complex.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n273\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.710\n&gt;&gt; Every step along the path requires it\n\n274\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.496\nto go between really like layer 3 and\n\n275\n00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:43.520\nlayer 2, checking every time to see if\nit actually matches when it does, okay?\n\n276\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.110\nAnd it can even change layer 2, but notice\nthat the layer 3 will never change, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.754\nNow this is good in terms of the\nexplanation to help you to walk through it\n\n278\n00:16:52.754 --> 00:16:56.364\nand understand it, that it's hard to\nsee in the way that I explain it.\n\n279\n00:16:56.364 --> 00:17:01.119\nSo I've gone ahead so that we can see\nthe frame rewrite process a little bit\n\n280\n00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:03.649\nbetter here, is I've even set it up and\n\n281\n00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:07.800\nadded in another router in\nbetween to help us out, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.960\nSo this is gonna be little\nbit more complex, but\n\n283\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.030\nit is gonna help you out to be able\nto see what happens at the very\n\n284\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.956\nbeginning.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n285\n00:17:14.956 --> 00:17:16.160\nmm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n286\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.140\nSo let's walk through this now.\n\n287\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.896\nNow using this diagram to help us\nto see what happens here, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:28.240\nSo if we start on the left-hand side with\nthe PC, and we begin to send a packet.\n\n289\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.135\nIt doesn't matter which one.\n\n290\n00:17:29.135 --> 00:17:32.030\nI made up these MAC addresses and\nIP addresses\n\n291\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.630\nbecause both of them are involved along\nthe path to its destination here.\n\n292\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.377\nAnd we'll see 3 different frame rewrites\nhere, is what we're actually see.\n\n293\n00:17:41.377 --> 00:17:46.660\nActually, 2, technically, as the 1st one\nis not considered a rewrite, all right?\n\n294\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.785\nSo when this guy says,\nI need to send a packet,\n\n295\n00:17:51.785 --> 00:17:57.990\n192.168.16.10, I need to send a packet,\nit becomes the source IP address.\n\n296\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.620\nAnd here is the layer 3 header, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.940\nIt also is the source MAC address.\n\n298\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.268\nAnd it puts its own layer 2 header on it,\nokay?\n\n299\n00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:10.553\nIt says,\nI need to get over to 172.16.23.2.\n\n300\n00:18:10.553 --> 00:18:13.690\nSo it puts this destination\nlayer 3 header on it.\n\n301\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.090\nAnd then it doesn't know what to\ndo at this point right here, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:24.067\nSo let's say, I forgot to\nactually kind of x this out here.\n\n303\n00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:26.331\nI already told you what\nthe actual one will be.\n\n304\n00:18:26.331 --> 00:18:28.180\nWell, let's start right there, okay?\n\n305\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.300\nSo it does not have a clue\nwhat that MAC address is.\n\n306\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.877\nSo this is where it looks it\nup in its own ARP table, okay?\n\n307\n00:18:36.877 --> 00:18:40.870\nAnd it doesn't find its ARP table,\nit issues out that ARP broadcast.\n\n308\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:45.337\nIn the ARP broadcast,\nthe only one that will reply will be R1's\n\n309\n00:18:45.337 --> 00:18:49.490\ninterface right here,\nwhich is also the default gateway.\n\n310\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.197\nDefault gateway will reply\nwith a proxy ARP saying,\n\n311\n00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:55.480\nyou can use my layer 2 address.\n\n312\n00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:04.630\nSo send it on instead to\nthe one with all b's, okay?\n\n313\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.550\nSo now we have a layer 2 frame.\n\n314\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.180\nAnd that layer 2 frame now is\nready to be turned into bits\n\n315\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.910\nto go across these devices here.\n\n316\n00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.820\nNow does the switch do anything?\n\n317\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.087\nThe switch doesn't, the switch\ndoes not affect the layer 2, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:20.087 --> 00:19:21.930\nBut it does use it, right?\n\n319\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.938\nWhen this now goes ahead and sends it out.\n\n320\n00:19:24.938 --> 00:19:28.681\nSo now 16.10 sends it into the switch.\n\n321\n00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:30.970\nThe switch also has a MAC\naddress that says what?\n\n322\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.261\nYou're on port 1 and the one with\nall b's over here is on port 5.\n\n323\n00:19:36.261 --> 00:19:39.855\nIt will now use that to\ntransmit at layer 2.\n\n324\n00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.955\nAnd then when it transmits,\n\n325\n00:19:41.955 --> 00:19:47.125\nit will then end up arriving right\nhere on this interface on Router 1.\n\n326\n00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:51.632\nOn Router 1,\nit will process the layer 2 header.\n\n327\n00:19:51.632 --> 00:19:56.658\nIt'll say, look,\nhere is the destination MAC address, okay?\n\n328\n00:19:56.658 --> 00:19:58.320\nThat belongs to me.\n\n329\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.874\nSo when it does that,\nit processes the layer 2 header.\n\n330\n00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:08.460\nSo this, essentially,\ngoes away at this point, okay?\n\n331\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.455\nSo Router 1 now will end up only seeing,\nafter it processes and says, yes,\n\n332\n00:20:13.455 --> 00:20:17.310\nthat belongs to me, so\nI'll process layer 2.\n\n333\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.901\nThen it will take a look and go,\nlet's take a look at layer 3.\n\n334\n00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:26.718\n172.16.23.2, well,\nthat's not my IP address, okay?\n\n335\n00:20:26.718 --> 00:20:30.970\nIt is not my IP address,\nI need to look it up in my routing table.\n\n336\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.740\nIf in the routing table, okay,\nit is possibility there, okay?\n\n337\n00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.310\nThen it will go ahead and\nforward it to the next exiting interface.\n\n338\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.582\nBut if it's not in the routing table,\n\n339\n00:20:43.582 --> 00:20:47.700\nthen it will either send it out a default\ngateway or it will go ahead and\n\n340\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.252\nsend back a message saying, I don't\nhave a clue where this route is, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:58.211\nWell, let's say that Router\n1 learns about 172.16.23.\n\n342\n00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:01.600\nAnd it says, yes,\nthat network is off of this interface.\n\n343\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:09.400\nWell, now Router 1 takes that\nparticular layer 3 packet.\n\n344\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.592\nAnd when it actually says and\nit hears from router 2 that\n\n345\n00:21:14.592 --> 00:21:21.229\nI know where 17216.23 is,\nit will rewrite the layer 2 frame.\n\n346\n00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:26.286\nSo this time it will say, all right,\nwe're sending it out from me instead,\n\n347\n00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:30.600\nWhich is gonna be this interface.\n\n348\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.230\nNotice again that the layer\n3 address doesn't change.\n\n349\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:41.070\nAnd then I am forwarding this on to Router\n2, which has now responded to my proxy.\n\n350\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.736\nOr it's actually responded\nwith a proxy ARP.\n\n351\n00:21:45.609 --> 00:21:48.676\nSo now in between Router 1 and Router 2,\n\n352\n00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:52.880\nwhen this packet gets put out\nonto this wire in between and\n\n353\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.277\ngoing in between,\nit will now receive it on the interface.\n\n354\n00:21:57.277 --> 00:22:00.190\nAnd it will start the process again, okay?\n\n355\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.990\nIt takes a look at layer 2 and says what?\n\n356\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.470\nThat layer 2 address matches.\n\n357\n00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:12.300\nSo let me go ahead and\nprocess the layer 2 header.\n\n358\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:18.158\nLet's check and see, well, no, at layer 3,\n\n359\n00:22:18.158 --> 00:22:23.496\nthe destination IP address\ndoes not match my IP address.\n\n360\n00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:25.143\nThis is where it will go ahead and\n\n361\n00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:28.310\ndo a route lookup in\nthe routing table once again.\n\n362\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:33.100\nAnd if, at that point, finds a match\nbecause it's directly connected over here,\n\n363\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.120\nthen it will say, hey,\nI know exactly where to send that.\n\n364\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.790\nSo it puts into the buffer on\nthe exiting interface over here.\n\n365\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.233\nAnd then it will begin to rewrite\nthe layer 3 header again, okay?\n\n366\n00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:51.008\nIt will say, that is my interface,\nwhich is all e's,\n\n367\n00:22:53.912 --> 00:22:59.446\nAnd the destination IP, Is all 1s.\n\n368\n00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:06.982\nSo now in the end,\nwhen it sends it out here, oops,\n\n369\n00:23:06.982 --> 00:23:09.140\nI actually put in the wrong one here.\n\n370\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.398\nI should've put 3 here is\nwhat I should've done.\n\n371\n00:23:12.398 --> 00:23:17.336\nIt's my fault, looking at it wrong,\nand it's over here.\n\n372\n00:23:18.691 --> 00:23:25.110\nAnd this one is all e's,\nAnd this one is all 1s.\n\n373\n00:23:27.616 --> 00:23:28.600\nOkay?\n\n374\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.830\nWhen it ends up arriving, look what\nhappens at this point, though, okay?\n\n375\n00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.100\nIt will say, hey,\ndestination MAC address, that is me.\n\n376\n00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:43.629\nLet me go ahead and process the layer 2\nframe cuz that is its layer 2 address.\n\n377\n00:23:43.629 --> 00:23:47.493\nNow it will take a look at layer 3 and\nrealize what?\n\n378\n00:23:47.493 --> 00:23:50.785\nThat is also my layer 3 header.\n\n379\n00:23:52.288 --> 00:23:54.759\nLet me process all of layer 3.\n\n380\n00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:59.060\nSo it will know exactly who it came from.\n\n381\n00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.352\nAnd it will go ahead and process.\n\n382\n00:24:00.352 --> 00:24:04.085\nOnce we hit past layer 3 in its process,\nmeans it goes up to layer 4.\n\n383\n00:24:04.085 --> 00:24:07.907\nIt's not gonna forward it on to anyplace\nelse Because its already processed what\n\n384\n00:24:07.907 --> 00:24:08.983\nwould move it, okay.\n\n385\n00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:13.288\nIn the reply back, it would again just\ngo through the same process going\n\n386\n00:24:13.288 --> 00:24:17.308\nthe opposite way instead,\nusing the same information that you and\n\n387\n00:24:17.308 --> 00:24:20.930\nI just put up here,\nis what we would end up seeing.\n\n388\n00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.290\nSo, this process, and\nstep by step in what we're seeing here,\n\n389\n00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:30.540\nallows us to see the traversal of\nthe packet moving from device to device.\n\n390\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.570\nRemember that when we move\nfrom device to device,\n\n391\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.530\nthat's how we forward data along\nits path to the destination, okay?\n\n392\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.610\nBut the IP address is important,\n\n393\n00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.202\nbecause that's how we know it's\narrived at its final destination.\n\n394\n00:24:43.202 --> 00:24:45.790\nIf it never processes the layer three,\n\n395\n00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:51.000\nlike we see here along this path, then it\nmeans it's never at its final destination.\n\n396\n00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.168\nOnly up here,\nwhen we process the layer two and\n\n397\n00:24:53.168 --> 00:24:55.681\nthree header did it arrive\nat its final destination.\n\n398\n00:24:55.681 --> 00:24:59.428\nAnd now, when it replies, it essentially\nsends it back along that same path.\n\n399\n00:24:59.428 --> 00:25:02.365\nStill, layer three header will not change,\nbut\n\n400\n00:25:02.365 --> 00:25:07.980\nthe layer two will change back along that\nsame path, and do the same thing again.\n\n401\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.550\nSo, that is for\nus to see how a packet does go across, and\n\n402\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.860\nis delivered through\nnetworks in this step.\n\n403\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.050\nNow, this of course happens,\nwhich is insanely,\n\n404\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.790\nright, it happens in milliseconds.\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say,\n\n405\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.770\nin the blink of an eye, or less.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it happened for you and\n\n406\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.661\nme in about 30 minutes, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:28.250\n&gt;&gt; So, that's what we're taking a look at.\n\n408\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.050\nNow, you need to understand this process,\nright?\n\n409\n00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.390\nBecause it doesn't really make\nsense when people just tell you,\n\n410\n00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.030\nyeah, it processes layer two,\nit processes layer three.\n\n411\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.261\nWell, you are now seeing, we are showing\nyou every step of what it has to do.\n\n412\n00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:41.480\nIt goes in layer two.\n\n413\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.140\nIf it's there,\nthen it processes layer three.\n\n414\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.404\nIf layer three is not processed on the\nrouter, it forwards it to the next device,\n\n415\n00:25:47.404 --> 00:25:48.232\nor it drops it.\n\n416\n00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:49.720\nThat's essentially what we have.\n\n417\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.038\nAnd then, ultimately, at its destination,\nit process layer two and layer three,\n\n418\n00:25:53.038 --> 00:25:54.830\nthen you know it's not\ngoing anywhere else.\n\n419\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.344\nBecause it's already now at the\napplication layer of everything that it\n\n420\n00:25:59.344 --> 00:26:00.520\nneeds to do.\n\n421\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.000\nSo, now it's just\nprocessing on that machine.\n\n422\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000\nSo, this is how you can get a single\npacket of data from one end of a network,\n\n423\n00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.460\nall the way across even another network,\nas well.\n\n424\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.920\nAnd for us,\nwe actually traverse to two networks here,\n\n425\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.520\nif you think about it.\n&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.\n\n426\n00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.180\n&gt;&gt; To make that happen.\n\n427\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.630\nSo, getting a grasp, and\na concept of this at the very beginning,\n\n428\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.420\nas you start taking a look at\nrouting Is really helpful.\n\n429\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.720\nBecause that actually lets you know\nhow the packets do work out, and\n\n430\n00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.160\nwhat has to happen.\n\n431\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.800\nNow, once we have a solid understanding of\nthat process, and what ends up happening,\n\n432\n00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.030\nwe can now begin to take a look, then,\nat working with routing tables,and\n\n433\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.415\nunderstanding how they're actually used as\nwell, through this entire process, too.\n\n434\n00:26:43.415 --> 00:26:46.110\nAnd then also take a look\nat routing protocols.\n\n435\n00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.490\nBut that will be, of course,\nfor future episodes.\n\n436\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:52.890\nBut for now, hopefully, that's a good\nexplanation, and a good understanding\n\n437\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.950\nof how data moves through your network.\n&gt;&gt; That's a great explanation,\n\n438\n00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.000\nI think, describes routing concepts.\n\n439\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.369\nAnd before we move on,\nRonnie, any last words?\n\n440\n00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:00.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, just,\n\n441\n00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.030\nif you're overwhelmed by what we just did,\nremember, the focus here is understanding.\n\n442\n00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.980\nIf you can do this along\nwith the OSI model,\n\n443\n00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.800\nit really takes a lot of the burden off,\nokay?\n\n444\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.770\nWe did a detailed step here, by step.\n\n445\n00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.200\nI don't think you're going to\nget tested that heavily on this.\n\n446\n00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.270\nBut it does help you when you go, hey,\nit stopped somewhere along the path.\n\n447\n00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.820\nI don't know where, but it stopped.\n\n448\n00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.760\nSo at some point, it stopped processing.\n\n449\n00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.550\nWell, that means either the packet got\ndropped, or it doesn't know what to do.\n\n450\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.820\nBut you actually do see it now, and how\nit actually works, all the way through.\n\n451\n00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.400\nSo, it's a good conceptual understanding\nof how routing can work for you.\n\n452\n00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.780\nAnd then, we'll dive into it\na little bit deeper next time.\n\n453\n00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.330\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie,\n\n454\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.210\nanother great Cisco C

00:00:13.230\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.190\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.120\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.370\nAs we continue on with Cisco CCET,\n\n10\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.800\nwe're gonna describe routing\ntables in this episode.\n\n11\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.030\nAnd the person that's gonna do that for\nus, it isn't me, it's Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.279\nRonnie, good to see you, sir, thanks for\n\n13\n00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.427\njoining.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Zach, for\n\n14\n00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.905\nhaving me on the show as we continue\non in our CCET journey together.\n\n15\n00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:38.581\nWe have now talked about some of\nthe basics of the routing concepts that\n\n16\n00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:42.631\nyou have to fundamentally understand,\nthe ability to of course get data from\n\n17\n00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.850\none device over to another\none on a different network.\n\n18\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.162\nWe've walked through every\nstep of that process.\n\n19\n00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:52.036\nSo that you understand what ends up\nworking between layer two and layer three\n\n20\n00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:56.480\nand how the data moves from device to\ndevice, to get to its endpoint as well.\n\n21\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.545\nNow at this point,\n\n22\n00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.349\nit means that we are ready to start\ndealing with the idea of routing.\n\n23\n00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:06.186\nAnd this is part of that process that we\nwere also talking about before where we do\n\n24\n00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:07.530\na routing lookup.\n\n25\n00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.450\nSo let's take a look at something\nnow as we get started here.\n\n26\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.900\nSo remember that when we take a look at\nthe idea of the packet delivery process,\n\n27\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.790\nand it gets into the router, well,\nwhat does the router do at that point?\n\n28\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.170\nWe've talked about a couple of\ndifferent things that it can do, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.770\nSo once layer two is processed,\n\n30\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.200\nremember that means it begins\nto look at layer three.\n\n31\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.950\nAnd there's two possibilities here, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.260\nIf the IP address matches what's on\nthe interface of that router, well,\n\n33\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.930\nthen it processor just\nlike everything else.\n\n34\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.460\nBut there's gonna be more than likely\na chance, especially with a router,\n\n35\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.170\nthat the destination IP\naddress is not going to match.\n\n36\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.310\nWell, when it doesn't match,\nthen at that point,\n\n37\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.080\nit ends up doing what\nwe call a route lookup.\n\n38\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.010\nAnd that means it goes to the routing\ntable on the router here, and\n\n39\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.250\ntries to find a match.\n\n40\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.460\nNow that match is very important because\nit actually does tell where that data\n\n41\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.810\nis supposed to go, even through\nthe router, to whatever exiting interface.\n\n42\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.060\nSo routers, unlike switches,\nthey don't have 24 ports.\n\n43\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.985\nMost of them have relatively few, 2 or 3,\n\n44\n00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:18.550\nmaybe 4 ports if you add an extra card or\nslot.\n\n45\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.160\nBut most of the time,\nright, it's not a lot.\n\n46\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.240\nSo what we have of course then,\nis this ability for the routing table\n\n47\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.750\nto simply say we are going to switch\nyou from what interface it came in on,\n\n48\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.580\nto the exiting interface of where\nit's supposed to go out to.\n\n49\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.540\nOkay, so what we are looking at then is we\nneed to understand how that routing table\n\n50\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.530\nactually is structured, and what\ninformation that you and I can find in\n\n51\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.770\nthat routing table, and why the router\nactually uses it the way that it does.\n\n52\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.570\nSo that's the part of the process that\nwe are gonna be taking a look at today.\n\n53\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.820\nSo when we take a look at a routing table\non the router itself, and I'm gonna try\n\n54\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.260\nand scroll it down a little bit so that we\ncan see some of the elements here, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.360\nIt's broken down, and\n\n56\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.420\nI have a list of about seven\ndifferent elements that you'll find.\n\n57\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.120\nNow they're gonna be very important,\nof course, as you get ready for\n\n58\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.484\nthe exam and as you start working\nwith routers to understand.\n\n59\n00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:16.728\nWhen you do this,\nyou can simply go to the router and\n\n60\n00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:21.035\ntype in at the privileged exec mode,\nnot at the config router mode.\n\n61\n00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:23.350\nYou're not doing it at the config router.\n\n62\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.330\nBut you simply type in, show ip route.\n\n63\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.040\nAnd that will show you the entire\nrouting table for that router okay?\n\n64\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.270\nAnd that's important,\nthe routing table is how\n\n65\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.940\nthe router makes the decision of how\nit gets information from one interface\n\n66\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.440\nover to the exiting interface that needs\nto, so it can go on to its next hop.\n\n67\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.830\nOkay, so when it actually discovers that,\n\n68\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.060\nit's because of the information stored\nright here in this routing table itself.\n\n69\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.300\nNow when you take a look\nat the routing table,\n\n70\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.570\nthere is a lot of information in it.\n\n71\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.580\nAnd for you and me, if we are gonna\nbe working with Cisco climate,\n\n72\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.770\nthis should feel second nature to you,\nas you start to work with it more and\n\n73\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.380\nmore, as you do this.\n\n74\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.135\nSo even at CCNT level,\nwe are gonna be describing it.\n\n75\n00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:10.590\nWe're gonna be pointing\nsome of the elements out.\n\n76\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.980\nBut once you get into the CCNA routing and\nswitching and\n\n77\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.150\nyou go on to your CCNP,\nit should be second nature for\n\n78\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.410\nyou to read the information here,\njust like you're reading a book.\n\n79\n00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.110\nAnd literally,\nthat's what you want it to become.\n\n80\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.700\nSo for us, we're gonna examine some of\nthese different elements at this point, to\n\n81\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.530\nmake sure that you understand what you're\ntaking a look at when we do this, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.960\nOnce you type in show ip route,\nwithout any additional modifiers,\n\n83\n00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.940\nor any filters, or anything else here,\nyou normally will get,\n\n84\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.680\nof course, well, essentially a legend.\n\n85\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.550\nIf you wanna call it something that you'll\nrecognize, right, the ability to match up\n\n86\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.650\na code that you see with the naming of\nwhat each of these things are about.\n\n87\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.180\nSo normally that code that you\nsee here in this code table,\n\n88\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.860\nor this legend up here,\nmatches up to, well,\n\n89\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.010\nsome of the elements that you'll\nsee inside of the routing table.\n\n90\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.350\nAnd lot of time, that's gonna be over\nhere on the far left-hand side, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.572\nOn the far left-hand side,\n\n92\n00:05:07.572 --> 00:05:11.880\nyou'll actually see some of the different\ncodes that are actually right here too.\n\n93\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.795\nAnd then you can look up.\n\n94\n00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:16.110\nSo for example, if I take a look\nat the letter R right here, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.330\nThe letter R, well,\nI can just go up to into this code table.\n\n96\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.180\nThen I can look, and that stands for RIP,\nwhich I know is a routing protocol, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.088\nSo dynamic routing protocol,\nwhich allows for, well,\n\n98\n00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:31.950\nthe router to actually be able to\nlearn routes from other routers.\n\n99\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.340\nSo I know that that is how this particular\nroute was also learned as well, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.115\nSo that's what we also end up seeing,\n\n101\n00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:41.850\nis just something simple as we go through,\nokay?\n\n102\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.130\nNow, as you start to look and\nfind some different things as well,\n\n103\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.627\nokay, you will actually kinda use this to\nhelp us out over on the left-hand side.\n\n104\n00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:53.330\nOne of the things that we want to\npoint out that you actually end up\n\n105\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.450\nseeing, right?\n\n106\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.250\nSo we've already talked about this\nidea of the codes that are there,\n\n107\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.130\nthe routing protocol codes.\n\n108\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.280\nBut let's take a look at this\nidea of prefix for a moment.\n\n109\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.550\nPrefix is the network prefix.\n\n110\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.000\nAnd instead of saying it's the network\nID number, they use prefix.\n\n111\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.700\nBecause what the router\nlooks like is how many bits,\n\n112\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.060\nokay, are actually gonna\nbe the network portion.\n\n113\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.770\nThe routing table really works by\nthe most specific networking or\n\n114\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.380\nprefix that we have.\n\n115\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.560\nSo the longer the actual prefix number,\n\n116\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.810\nthat's what it's gonna go with\nusually by default as well.\n\n117\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.284\nSo for example, this particular\nrouter ended up finding a route for\n\n118\n00:06:34.284 --> 00:06:39.210\nthe 34.0.0.0/24 network here.\n\n119\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.217\nWell, the prefix would be 34.0.0.0.\n\n120\n00:06:44.217 --> 00:06:46.940\nThat's what the prefix would be, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.850\nThat is the network ID, okay.\n\n122\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.250\nThe other part that you also see\nhere is right after the slash.\n\n123\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.820\nSo beginning with the slash and\nthen the 24, that is gonna represent your\n\n124\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.849\nnetwork mask,\ntelling you that 24 bits of this 32-bit\n\n125\n00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.278\nrouter ID is gonna be the network\nportion for what we're seeing.\n\n126\n00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:12.360\nAnd as you scroll down, you'll actually\nsee some different ones maybe pop up.\n\n127\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.220\nSo down here, notice next to the letter\nL as I go along through here, you'll\n\n128\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.220\nactually see that there's one that's\na /32, and there's another /32 down here.\n\n129\n00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.600\nSo each one of these actually has a prefix\nas well as a network mask too, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.130\nIn each particular route\nthat you see listed here,\n\n131\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:37.870\nyou'll also not only find that idea of,\nof course, the route itself.\n\n132\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.220\nBut you'll find a couple\nof other things too, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.990\nSo on this one, sometimes you see\nthe term where it says next hop, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.165\nBut you'll also end up seeing where it\nsays, hey, this is how you get there.\n\n135\n00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:58.307\nSo notice that if you wanted to go from\nthis router to the 34.33.32 network,\n\n136\n00:07:58.307 --> 00:08:04.630\nit says you are going to\ngo to 192.168 .12.2, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.614\nSo there's two possibilities in this\nconfiguration that you have as well.\n\n138\n00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:11.872\nSo you actually say hey,\nthat's the way it's gonna go and\n\n139\n00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:14.344\nthat's your next top\nat that point as well.\n\n140\n00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:18.470\nSo you're seeing the prefix,\nyou're also seeing the network mask.\n\n141\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.860\nYou're also seeing the next hop\nthat is supposed to get you.\n\n142\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.480\nHere's the IP address, so that I can\nreach 34.33.32 that's gonna happen.\n\n143\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.550\nOn this router,\n\n144\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.800\nyou got a GigabitEthernet0/0 to\nget there as what you also see.\n\n145\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.210\nNow, along with that bit of information,\nright?\n\n146\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.148\nThere's a bit of other stuff that we\nhave to talk about as well, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:47.845\nAdministrative distance and metric,\nall of that is inside these square\n\n148\n00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:50.777\nbrackets that you see right here too,\nokay?\n\n149\n00:08:50.777 --> 00:08:55.449\nNow inside the square brackets you'll see,\nof course, a bracket with a single number\n\n150\n00:08:55.449 --> 00:08:58.979\nat the beginning, a slash, and\nthen another number after that.\n\n151\n00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:04.858\nThe first number that you see listed there\nis called the administrative distance.\n\n152\n00:09:04.858 --> 00:09:09.814\nAnd the idea of the administrative\ndistance is a ranking of the routing,\n\n153\n00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:11.041\nwhat can I say it?\n\n154\n00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.490\nRouting protocols believability.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.030\n&gt;&gt; That means that there are different\n\n156\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.200\nrouting protocols that are out there.\n\n157\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.300\nYou take a look up here at\nthe top on the codes here right?\n\n158\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.006\nNotice there's local,\nthere's connected, there's static.\n\n159\n00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:28.520\nThere's RIP, mobile, BGP, EIGRP,\n\n160\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.200\nnotice the code here is where it says D\nand we'll talk about that for a moment.\n\n161\n00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.470\nThere's also OSPF that's up here,\nthere's also a bunch of\n\n162\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.840\nother types of codes that are up here,\nbut for us we'll see that\n\n163\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.930\nthat's kinda what we'll stick to out of\nthe ones that are a little bit higher.\n\n164\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.160\nInside of the middle list, there is also\nanother routing protocol called ISIS, and\n\n165\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.890\nwhen you start seeing\nthat as well down here.\n\n166\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.080\nAnd these are other types of\nrouting protocols that exist, but\n\n167\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.420\nwe don't tend to see them too often\nin today's networks as well, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.530\nSo, inside of this, what you have is each\none of those different routing protocols\n\n169\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.640\nwill have what they call\nadministrative distance.\n\n170\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.240\nAdministrative distance is somebody or\nthe router itself, saying here is\n\n171\n00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.620\nhow we are ranking these particular\nprotocols based on their believability.\n\n172\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.550\nOn what we believe is\ngonna be the best way for\n\n173\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.950\nyou to get to that destination network.\n\n174\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.980\nSo that's what you'll end up seeing.\n\n175\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.446\nSometimes you'll see where\nthose numbers will change.\n\n176\n00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:30.404\nOn this one it looks like I'm only running\na RIP which means the routing protocol\n\n177\n00:10:30.404 --> 00:10:33.524\nits administrative\ndistance is gonna be 120.\n\n178\n00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:34.996\nBut there are other ones and\n\n179\n00:10:34.996 --> 00:10:39.101\nwe'll take a look at a table of these\nadministrative distances in a moment.\n\n180\n00:10:39.101 --> 00:10:43.205\nBut that's the key here is that's how it\ndecides, if now you get multiple routing\n\n181\n00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:47.266\nprotocols it's gonna make the decision\nbased on the administrative distance.\n\n182\n00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:51.173\nAnd the one that is actually the lowest\nadministrative distance will end up\n\n183\n00:10:51.173 --> 00:10:54.340\ngetting into the routing table itself,\nokay?\n\n184\n00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:00.320\nThe idea of the metric is also dependent\non the idea of the routing protocol too.\n\n185\n00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.510\nDifferent routing protocols will have\ndifferent metrics that their based on.\n\n186\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.570\nSo for example, the idea of RIP which\nis the Routing Information Protocol,\n\n187\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.800\nit is based on the number\nof hops to the destination.\n\n188\n00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.760\nIn other words, how many routes or\nhow many other routers do I have to hit\n\n189\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.240\nbefore I get to the destination network,\nokay?\n\n190\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.030\nSo that can be true, but there's also\nother ones that we see up here, for\n\n191\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:30.340\nexample, like this one, the D for EIGRP.\n\n192\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.110\nEIGRP stands for\nEnhanced Interior Gateway Protocol.\n\n193\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:40.330\nAnd that is a very sophisticated\nprotocol that has about bandwidth and\n\n194\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.890\ndelay as this metric, which means it's\nactually a more defined metric for\n\n195\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.560\nus, and it has a lower\nadministrative distance as well.\n\n196\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:56.420\nAnd then you have OSPPF which actually\nfalls into clean what RIP and EIGRP, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.190\nSo, the reason why that's actually\nimportant in terms of administrative\n\n198\n00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.670\ndistance, they also have\ndifferent metrics, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.500\nOSPF is really based on\nbandwidth in between, and\n\n200\n00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.610\nthen EIGRP is based on bandwidth and\ndelay, and then\n\n201\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.200\nRIP is only based on the number of routers\nin between me and the destination, okay?\n\n202\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.307\nSo, all those are actually different.\n\n203\n00:12:19.307 --> 00:12:23.910\nSo in RIP here, you'll see\nan administrative distance of 6.\n\n204\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:31.366\nSo that means that there is actually 6\nhops between me and network 34.33.32.\n\n205\n00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:35.204\nSo there's six router hops that I\nhave to go through to get there.\n\n206\n00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:37.571\nBut in the EIGRP it could\nbe something different.\n\n207\n00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:41.603\nIt could be 34.92, it could be 15,\nit could be whenever it might be,\n\n208\n00:12:41.603 --> 00:12:42.739\nit doesn't matter.\n\n209\n00:12:42.739 --> 00:12:47.637\nBut that's a different way of actually\ncounting that particular metric to\n\n210\n00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:50.870\nthat destination network as well.\n\n211\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.350\nNow there is one last element\nhere that we want to point out,\n\n212\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.670\nwhich is this idea of the gateway\nof last resort is not set, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.910\nNow, you can set this and this is\nsomething that you may choose to set up,\n\n214\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.640\nit is all dependent\nupon your network here.\n\n215\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.941\nBut if it says the gateway of last resort\nis not set, well, what does that mean?\n\n216\n00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:15.166\nYou and I on our regular computers we\nhave what we call a default gateway.\n\n217\n00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:20.116\nAnd that is so that when my computer\nneeds to send something somewhere,what it\n\n218\n00:13:20.116 --> 00:13:24.997\ntakes a look at it says, hey, is the\ndestination IP address on this network?\n\n219\n00:13:24.997 --> 00:13:26.577\nOr is it on another network?\n\n220\n00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:31.608\nOr it's on another network,\nit knows that it's supposed to send it\n\n221\n00:13:31.608 --> 00:13:36.745\nto the router interface, or\nto the default gateway address, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:41.305\nAnd the way it does that is because what\nthe router itself has put a proxy outside,\n\n223\n00:13:41.305 --> 00:13:43.331\nI am the default gateway to do that.\n\n224\n00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:46.340\nSo here you can set that up for\nthe router.\n\n225\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.079\nAnd what does that actually mean?\n\n226\n00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:53.484\nThat means that if now the router receives\na packet, that is not destined for\n\n227\n00:13:53.484 --> 00:13:58.635\nany one of the networks that are listed\nhere in the routing table itself,\n\n228\n00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:02.098\nit will say let's send it\nout to this IP address,\n\n229\n00:14:02.098 --> 00:14:05.149\nwhich should get it to\nwhere it needs to go.\n\n230\n00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:09.815\nSo in other words, it gives us another\npath to take if we don't have a route\n\n231\n00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:12.698\nsetup anywhere inside\nof our routing table.\n\n232\n00:14:12.698 --> 00:14:17.619\nSo there is a ton of information that\nwe do see just taking look and listed\n\n233\n00:14:17.619 --> 00:14:22.140\nright here in this routing table, okay?\n&gt;&gt; There sure is.\n\n234\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.360\n&gt;&gt; Now, in thinking about that, right?\n\n235\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.950\nYou do need to know about these particular\n\n236\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.240\nelements that are listed\nover here on the left.\n\n237\n00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.500\nThey are the ones officially caught\nout on the exam objectives, so\n\n238\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.760\nmake sure you do take a look at that.\n\n239\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.410\nBut what we wanna do is we\nwanna see this in action, and\n\n240\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.350\nsee that working on real routers.\n\n241\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.141\nHere is something I did on a screen shot\nwhen I actually took a look at routers I\n\n242\n00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:47.589\nsaid, here is a good shot for\nus to be able to talk about these things.\n\n243\n00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.229\nBut now we are actually ready and\nthen we'll come back and\n\n244\n00:14:50.229 --> 00:14:53.259\nwe'll hit administrative distance\na little bit more at the end.\n\n245\n00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.794\nBut lets get into our lab here,\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n246\n00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:58.260\n&gt;&gt; And we'll start with this, okay.\n\n247\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.330\nSo here we are, we are in a lab\nenvironment, and on this particular lab\n\n248\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.840\nenvironment, this is the one that\ntalks about comparing static and\n\n249\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.390\ndynamic routing at the very beginning\nhere, as we start to see this, okay?\n\n250\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.148\nSo we are gonna talk about\nwhat that actually means.\n\n251\n00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:18.092\nWhen we start implementing routing,\nthere is two ways to implement routing,\n\n252\n00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:22.113\none off course is statically, that's\nwhere you configure the routes, okay?\n\n253\n00:15:22.113 --> 00:15:27.038\nAnd if you configure them that is going\nto be well the way that the path is\n\n254\n00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:28.301\nalways gonna go.\n\n255\n00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:32.506\nBut remember that networks can continue\nto change and if a network changes and\n\n256\n00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:36.582\nyou only have static routing, the drawback\nis that that means you also have\n\n257\n00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:38.860\nto configure that routing again, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.290\nAs your networks change down the path,\nsomething else actually goes and\n\n259\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.010\nbreaks down, you are the one that has\nto come back and account for that.\n\n260\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.766\nStatic routing really does work well,\nas long as your network isn't\n\n261\n00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:55.777\nchanging too often, or changing at all,\nand so that's a possibility.\n\n262\n00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:57.959\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n263\n00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:03.770\nSo inside of this lab that they have,\nI'm going to select NYEDGE1.\n\n264\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.040\nAnd then on NYEDGE1, let's take a look\nat its routing table from right here.\n\n265\n00:16:12.576 --> 00:16:19.970\nLet me do a show, so\nI just did enable show IP route.\n\n266\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.020\nSee, now that looks a little\nbit diminutive to me.\n\n267\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.410\nSo let me change that up,\nis that a little too big?\n\n268\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.850\nLet's try that, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.671\nAnd now you'll see that the routing\ntable is not exactly very large here.\n\n270\n00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:34.490\nBut you are seeing some of the same\nelements that I just showed you, right?\n\n271\n00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.340\nThe very fact is you're\nseeing the coding table and\n\n272\n00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.670\nyou're also seeing\nthe routes that are in here.\n\n273\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.384\nNow, I wanna point out\na couple of things that, for\n\n274\n00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:46.102\nthose of you that have been\nworking with routers for\n\n275\n00:16:46.102 --> 00:16:49.597\na little bit of time and\nnow you're starting to pursue your CCMT.\n\n276\n00:16:49.597 --> 00:16:54.277\nYou might see something here that you're\nnot exactly sure what to do with it,\n\n277\n00:16:54.277 --> 00:16:57.310\nwhich is this one with the letter L, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.030\nNow, you take a look at the code and\nthe letter L for you and you're saying,\n\n279\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.090\nI don't remember seeing that before,\nand I've been working with routers for\n\n280\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.490\na little bit of time.\n\n281\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.390\nAnd that is actually an update that\nhappened with the newer iOS version,\n\n282\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.500\nreally beginning in 15.\n\n283\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.380\niOS version 15 and above,\nyou now also have what we call\n\n284\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.660\nthe local code here as well.\n\n285\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.700\nNow whenever you see that,\nnotice these two,\n\n286\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.860\nconnected means what, it's on right\noff of one of those interfaces okay?\n\n287\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:36.840\nSo that means I am directly connected to\nthis network, which is 192.16.0 network,\n\n288\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:43.730\nand notice the prefix as well as\nthe subnet mask, which is the /24, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.830\nWhen you compare the difference\nbetween that and the local,\n\n290\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.140\nnotice this one actually goes\nto an actual host IP address.\n\n291\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.690\nIt's not just 16.0 saying here's\nwhere the network is, but\n\n292\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.480\nnotice it actually goes\nall the way to 16.1 and\n\n293\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.540\nits subnet mask is a 32 bit\nsubnet mask as well, okay?\n\n294\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.470\nThis local is designed to allow you\n\n295\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.231\nto route directly to a single\nhost if you need to, okay?\n\n296\n00:18:12.231 --> 00:18:16.750\nAnd that did not happen inside of\nthe 12 series on the iOS routers.\n\n297\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:21.450\nSo you might be looking like I\ndon't remember seeing a local one,\n\n298\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.390\nall I saw was connected ones.\n\n299\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:28.076\nBut to help kinda speed things along\nthey also implemented this, like I said,\n\n300\n00:18:28.076 --> 00:18:29.785\nbeginning in the 15 code.\n\n301\n00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:32.999\nAnd that's why it's important that,\nas you do these labs,\n\n302\n00:18:32.999 --> 00:18:36.843\nthat you may see things that are a little\nbit not configured the same way as\n\n303\n00:18:36.843 --> 00:18:40.820\nif you have a home lab setup with\nan older version of the iOS, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.540\nSo that's kind of a newer feature that\nwe see right here when we do this, okay?\n\n305\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.175\nSo that's gonna be key at\nleast to point out, but\n\n306\n00:18:48.175 --> 00:18:52.238\nit's the same thing that we saw where\nwe saw all those different elements.\n\n307\n00:18:52.238 --> 00:18:56.165\nNotice once again gateway\nof last resort is not set,\n\n308\n00:18:56.165 --> 00:19:00.091\nwe have our prefix,\nwe have our subnet mask as well,\n\n309\n00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:04.120\nwe see that it is directly connected,\nokay, at two.\n\n310\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.350\nAnd so\nwe're saying if you wanna get to that,\n\n311\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.190\nall you have to do is go out of this\ninterface, GigabitEthernet0/0, and\n\n312\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.960\nthat will get you to that 16.0 network or\nit will get you to 16.1.\n\n313\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.450\nEither way it actually has\nthat ability to do so, okay?\n\n314\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:24.513\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nconfigure an IP address as\n\n315\n00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:31.011\nwell on our sister interface over here,\nwhich is GigabitEthernet0/1.\n\n316\n00:19:31.011 --> 00:19:33.865\nSo let's go into our global\nconfiguration mode here.\n\n317\n00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:42.572\nAnd then into interface gigabit\n\n318\n00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:51.738\nethernet0/1, then we're\ngonna do an ip address\n\n319\n00:19:51.738 --> 00:19:57.573\n172.14.0.1 255.255.255.0,\n\n320\n00:19:57.573 --> 00:20:02.805\nremember you also have to\nenter in the subnet mask.\n\n321\n00:20:05.445 --> 00:20:07.445\nNow let's issue a no shutdown.\n\n322\n00:20:07.445 --> 00:20:10.355\nRouters, remember,\nare default as they turn on,\n\n323\n00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:12.935\nthe interfaces are not\non by default as well.\n\n324\n00:20:12.935 --> 00:20:18.840\nAnd then we'll get out of this to\ngo back into our privilege mode.\n\n325\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.370\nNow that I've done that, okay, let's take\na look at the command again show ip route.\n\n326\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.158\nAnd now notice what has happened, okay?\n\n327\n00:20:29.158 --> 00:20:33.420\nNow that I've added in that single\ninterface it's also added in\n\n328\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.670\nan additional network\nprefix that is also done.\n\n329\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.500\nAnd it's completely just doubled\nat least my routing table\n\n330\n00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.390\nfrom what I saw up above here okay?\n\n331\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.470\nSo just by doing that I have now increased\nthe routing, the capabilities here, but\n\n332\n00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.020\nthat is key, right?\n\n333\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.070\nIt lets you know something, that you\ncannot run a routing table really, okay?\n\n334\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.645\nOn just one interface connected,\nyou need at least two to\n\n335\n00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:02.485\nreally have something to route between.\n&gt;&gt; Makes\n\n336\n00:21:02.485 --> 00:21:05.080\nsense.\n&gt;&gt; So now it actually does give you\n\n337\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.644\na little bit more information.\n\n338\n00:21:07.644 --> 00:21:13.559\nSo I can route now between 172.14 network\nand 192.168.16 network at this point.\n\n339\n00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:17.790\nSo you normally need at\nleast those two to do that.\n\n340\n00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.906\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\nsee what we can ping here.\n\n341\n00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:28.563\nSo here let's verify that\nwe have some connectivity.\n\n342\n00:21:28.563 --> 00:21:31.436\nSo this one has me pinging some device,\n\n343\n00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:35.900\nwhich is gonna be 172.16.16.11 here,\nright?\n\n344\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.400\nNow in theory this should not show up,\nokay?\n\n345\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.380\nSo we should actually not get\nany pings that are coming back.\n\n346\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.050\nAnd I'm getting those dots which\nmeans pings are not happening.\n\n347\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.140\nWe're saying well,\nwhy are they not happening?.\n\n348\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.620\nWe can not get to a network from a router\n\n349\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.460\nif it doesn't show up in\nthe routing table, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:59.420\nNow, I say that, but\nthere is an override to this.\n\n351\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.940\nIf you see where the gateway of last\nresort is set and this network,\n\n352\n00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:12.090\nor this device, is actually gonna\nbe off of that particular next hop\n\n353\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:17.070\ndevice that we told it to send everything\nto, then it will still reply something.\n\n354\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.810\nBut if it's not set,\nif the gateway of last resort is not set,\n\n355\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:27.370\nthen it has to depend on what is\nright here in the routing table for\n\n356\n00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.550\nit to be able to answer any pings at all,\nokay?\n\n357\n00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.017\nNow, let's go ahead and take a look\nat our interfaces here for a moment.\n\n358\n00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:42.838\nSo let's do a show ip interface brief.\n\n359\n00:22:45.372 --> 00:22:49.400\nAnd let's verify that we have\neverything else that we want here.\n\n360\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.520\nSo everything looks good, those are the\nones that have been configured here.\n\n361\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.270\nLet's do the same thing for NYWAN1.\n\n362\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:03.040\nNYWAN1 is one of the routers that\nthe NYEDGE1 is also connected to.\n\n363\n00:23:06.826 --> 00:23:12.373\nSo show ip interface brief.\n\n364\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.910\nLet's see what's on this one.\n\n365\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.990\nNow here,\nit's not exactly directly connected, but\n\n366\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.960\nhere's one of the things that we at\nleast pinged this network, right?\n\n367\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.364\nWe did the actual 16.11 so\n\n368\n00:23:26.364 --> 00:23:31.730\nlet's see what if I try to ping\nthe 172.16.1 from NYEDGE1?\n\n369\n00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.958\nLet's try that.\n\n370\n00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:36.135\nPing 172.16.16.1 instead of 11.\n\n371\n00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:42.845\nWell now it's still not working, okay?\n\n372\n00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:45.865\nOnce again it's not in the routing\ntable so it's not gonna come through,\n\n373\n00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:47.620\nit doesn't know how to get there.\n\n374\n00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.184\nSo even though the router\nis actually taking a look,\n\n375\n00:23:50.184 --> 00:23:54.169\nremember if it doesn't match, right,\nit has to either drop the packet, okay?\n\n376\n00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:58.594\nAnd when it does so, it is giving\nthis machine a reply that comes back,\n\n377\n00:23:58.594 --> 00:24:00.319\nwhich are these dots here.\n\n378\n00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:04.828\nAnd that's what it's showing up, or it\nfinds the default gateway but the default\n\n379\n00:24:04.828 --> 00:24:09.810\ngateway is not set and that's why we're\nalso not getting there as well, okay?\n\n380\n00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:14.700\nSo now we are ready to create\na static route in between so\n\n381\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.710\nthat we can have this work\nthe way that we want to, okay?\n\n382\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.990\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n383\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.330\nThe great thing is static routes\nare actually the easiest to configure.\n\n384\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.190\nBut the key here is that even\nif you create a static route\n\n385\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.700\nyou've gotta remember to\ncreate it on both ends.\n\n386\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.470\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about here all right?\n\n387\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:38.215\nSo back on NYEDGE1, let's get into\nour global configuration mode.\n\n388\n00:24:41.492 --> 00:24:45.930\nAnd now inside of our global configuration\nmode, I am ready to create a static route.\n\n389\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.420\nHow we create a static route is\nwe begin by typing in the syntax,\n\n390\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.650\nip route, and then I'm gonna do\na question mark, a help command,\n\n391\n00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.380\nto allow us to see the other options\nthat we have available, okay?\n\n392\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.080\nRight now for us as we do this, right?\n\n393\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.820\nWe can go ahead and\ndo a couple of things here.\n\n394\n00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.880\nNotice it says allow static routes.\n\n395\n00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.840\nIP route static?\n\n396\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.900\nThat's not what I want.\n\n397\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.400\nI want to manually configure, so\n\n398\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.840\nwe are really going to be focusing in\non configuring the destination prefix.\n\n399\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.060\nNow that's not necessarily\nthe entire address, but\n\n400\n00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.780\nit's only that network\nportion that I want.\n\n401\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:31.103\nSo here I would begin typing an ip\nroute then 172.16.16.0 okay?\n\n402\n00:25:31.103 --> 00:25:36.242\nFor us that's also gonna be with\na 24 bit subnet mask, it's gonna\n\n403\n00:25:36.242 --> 00:25:42.840\nbe 255.255.255.0, but\nI am not done yet, okay?\n\n404\n00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.720\nSo I know that I'm creating\na route that says look,\n\n405\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.280\nI need to get to that network but\nI do not know where yet.\n\n406\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.480\nSo know it's actually saying,\nwhat do we want?\n\n407\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.725\nWe have two ways to configure this, okay?\n\n408\n00:25:55.725 --> 00:26:02.270\nOf course the next thing, usually for us,\nwe would type in the next hop IP address.\n\n409\n00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.320\nIn other words, where do I want\nthis particular route to go\n\n410\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.397\nto get to 172.16.16, okay?\n\n411\n00:26:10.397 --> 00:26:13.630\nThe other thing you can do instead\n\n412\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:18.840\nis that you tell it what exiting\ninterface to go out of, if you choose to.\n\n413\n00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.954\nSo, if you know that you only have one\nexiting interface, in other words you\n\n414\n00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:27.392\ndon't know where it's going but you only\nhave this one other interface that it has\n\n415\n00:26:27.392 --> 00:26:31.663\nto go out, you can just say I want it to\ngo out to this interface on my own router.\n\n416\n00:26:31.663 --> 00:26:36.939\nBut usually the best practice of course\nis to configure the default next hop,\n\n417\n00:26:36.939 --> 00:26:39.859\nor the next hop, not the default next hop,\n\n418\n00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:44.580\nI'm just gonna copy that so\nI don't have to type it in again.\n\n419\n00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:50.549\nSo our next address that we\nwant us to go to is gonna be\n\n420\n00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:57.500\n192.168.16.3, okay?\n\n421\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.062\nThat is gonna be the next hop.\n\n422\n00:27:00.062 --> 00:27:04.450\nSo now I'm trying to put in to\nthe routing table the 172.16.16 and\n\n423\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.130\nhere is the next hop as well.\n\n424\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.956\nOops, I misspelled something, so\nlet me try it one more time here,\n\n425\n00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:20.951\nip route, so apparently copying and\npasting is not my best bet here.\n\n426\n00:27:23.323 --> 00:27:30.728\n.0 and then 192.168.16.3, okay.\n\n427\n00:27:30.728 --> 00:27:34.029\nSo now, if I typed in a do show ip route,\n\n428\n00:27:37.508 --> 00:27:40.270\nNotice the code changes.\n\n429\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:45.940\nWe have an S for static but also now\nnotice that this changes too, okay?\n\n430\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.470\nSo inside the administrative distance as\nwell as the metric ended up changing too.\n\n431\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.220\nSo this one is telling me hey,\n172.16.16 has\n\n432\n00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.020\nan administrative distance of 1,\nnotice the metric is 0.\n\n433\n00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.300\nNow when we start seeing metrics\nof zero saying there's no hop,\n\n434\n00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.510\nwhere are we sending it?\n\n435\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:11.040\nWe're actually telling it to send it out\nof this IP address right here, okay?\n\n436\n00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.136\nSo this is saying I know exactly where\nto go, this is directly connected,\n\n437\n00:28:15.136 --> 00:28:19.360\nthere is no hop in between,\nit's just going to send it there, okay?\n\n438\n00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.420\nAnd so that means that this\nparticular router, actually,\n\n439\n00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.960\nthis is a layer 3 switch.\n\n440\n00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.758\nIf you now take a look here,\n\n441\n00:28:27.758 --> 00:28:33.610\nyou can see that we're\nstarting to get to 172.16.\n\n442\n00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.423\nWe have to send it out this interface,\n192.168.16.1.\n\n443\n00:28:37.423 --> 00:28:41.940\nSo, this GigabitEthernet0/0,\n\n444\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:47.740\nthat is actually statically or\nvery closely connected to,\n\n445\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.390\nwell this interface, which means\nit's in the same network for us.\n\n446\n00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.170\nWe're not taking any hop\nto go anywhere else.\n\n447\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.930\nAll right so should I now be able to ping,\n\n448\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:04.370\ndo ping 172.16.16.1, okay?\n\n449\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.510\nSo there it is, I am now able to\nping that particular address and\n\n450\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.350\nwe can actually get to it.\n\n451\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.150\nNow there's also a problem\nthough that can happen.\n\n452\n00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.340\nUsually on static routing when you do\nthis, okay, on this side, it's already\n\n453\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.790\nbeen configured for the other side, but\nyou have to configure it on both ends.\n\n454\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.468\nBecause if not,\nyou'll send data in one way, but\n\n455\n00:29:26.468 --> 00:29:32.249\nif the other side is not ready to return\ntraffic or it has to return traffic, and\n\n456\n00:29:32.249 --> 00:29:37.788\nis not in the routing table over on\nthe other side which is on NYEDGE1 here,\n\n457\n00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.370\nOn NYEDGE1, it would not\nnormally know how to get it back.\n\n458\n00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.670\nSo let me type out shell\niproute not do shell.\n\n459\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.490\nSo on shellip route,\nit has to have a path coming all the way\n\n460\n00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.340\nback to .16.3 network and\nnotice that it already had\n\n461\n00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.680\nenlisted in here because it\nis locally connected to it.\n\n462\n00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:09.184\nSo if this was actually not that way and\nyou're actually pinging to another network\n\n463\n00:30:09.184 --> 00:30:13.234\nthat was offlist, and it didn't have\nit in the routing table to come back,\n\n464\n00:30:13.234 --> 00:30:15.314\nwell then you couldn't do so, okay?\n\n465\n00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:19.292\nSo when you set up static route it has\nto be configured on both sides for\n\n466\n00:30:19.292 --> 00:30:23.220\nyou to normally do that and\nmake sure that ends that problem, okay?\n\n467\n00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.890\nAll right, so now Zach, there's a lot for\nus to talk about with the routing table,\n\n468\n00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.930\ncuz we still got some things to examine.\n\n469\n00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.330\nAnd we still need to talk about\nthe idea of configuring for\n\n470\n00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.700\ndynamic routing protocols but we are at\nthe end of this particular segment.\n\n471\n00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.240\nSo let's go ahead and stop it right now,\nand then we'll have a part 2\n\n472\n00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.077\nwhen we come back.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but may I say, well done, Ronnie.\n\n473\n00:30:43.077 --> 00:30:47.010\nDescribe Routing Tables Part 1,\nthere will be a Part 2, and\n\n474\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.440\nthere might even be a Part 3,\nyou never know.\n\n475\n00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.480\nAnyway, before we move on,\n\n476\n00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.437\nRonnie, any last words?\n&gt;&gt; Well just remember, right,\n\n477\n00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:57.920\non static routing, it actually has to be\nconfigured normally on both sides for us.\n\n478\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.170\nBut on this one, cuz it was directly\nconnected to the router, it said hey,\n\n479\n00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.880\nas I'm replying back, I know exactly\nwhere to send out cuz it was in\n\n480\n00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.670\nthe routing table already so\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n481\n00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.240\nBut if you don't find it in\nthe routing table on the other side,\n\n482\n00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.325\nyou have to configure it there too.\n\n483\n00:31:12.325 --> 00:31:16.275\nSo it is very possible you configure on\none side and it doesn't work, make sure\n\n484\n00:31:16.275 --> 00:31:18.345\nyou always configure on both sides.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic and\n\n485\n00:31:18.345 --> 00:31:21.195\nyou'll find out more in\nDescribe Routing Tables Part 2.\n\n486\n00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:24.495\nMake sure you see everything inside\nthe Cisco CSense Series too.\n\n487\n00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:27.195\nRonnie has done a great job putting\nthat all together for you and\n\n488\n00:31:27.195 --> 00:31:29.775\nit'll help you in the exams and even more.\n\n489\n00:31:29.775 --> 00:31:33.015\nAnd by the way it'll be in the course\nlibrary too and there's thousands of other\n\n490\n00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:36.690\nvideos there designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n491\n00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.910\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nIT Pro TV, IT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n492\n00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.460\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n493\n00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.574\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n494\n00:31:46.574 --> 00:31:52.633\n[MUSIC]\n\n495\n00:31:52.633 -->

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.759\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:07.867\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:12.309\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.010\nwatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.110\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco CCENT\n\n8\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.250\ndescribe routing tables part two,\nmake sure you see part one.\n\n9\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.190\nAnd the person to bring us the information\nwe need is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.250\nRonnie, great to see you again, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.740\nhaving me back as we continue on\nin our lab here for Cisco CCENT.\n\n12\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.650\nAnd we're in the middle of,\n\n13\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.850\nof course, taking a look at\nthe elements in the routing table.\n\n14\n00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.740\nWe've already talked and described about\nso many different elements that are there,\n\n15\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.450\nand now we're showing you how it\nalso works as we come through, and\n\n16\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.550\nas we're starting to work\nwith the routers too, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.530\nSo so far in our lab, we've configured\nwhat, one side of a static route, and\n\n18\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.540\nwe also, of course,\nverified that it is working\n\n19\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.865\nby being on a ping now that's\ninside of the routing table.\n\n20\n00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:05.470\nAnd we still need to configure the other\nside, and show you how that also worked.\n\n21\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.160\nThen we'll jump into dynamic\nrouting protocols as well, and\n\n22\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.250\ntalk about some administrative distance.\n\n23\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460\nSo we're ready to pick up from here.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n24\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look here, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.030\nRight on my machine, we left off exactly\nin this place here where we were\n\n26\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.050\njust finishing up, we had just\nfinished pinging the other side.\n\n27\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.320\nAnd now we came to NYWAN1,\nand we showed why it\n\n28\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.710\ndid end up replying even though I said\nyou have to configure both sides.\n\n29\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.760\nIt is because that route\nis already in there.\n\n30\n00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.310\nNow, this is something\nthat gets confusing for\n\n31\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.490\nmost people that are just starting off.\n\n32\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.170\nBecause they're multiple IP addresses on\nthis device and even on NYEDGE1, right?\n\n33\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060\nOkay, there are actually going to be\nmultiple IP addresses on this one.\n\n34\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.963\nLet me show you what I mean, do show\nIP interface, brief, just briefly here.\n\n35\n00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.150\nAll right, so, Zack, as you take\na look at this table right here, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.413\nNotice that on Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 and\n\n37\n00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:10.589\n0/1 there's two different IP addresses,\nright?\n\n38\n00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:14.165\nThen go all the way down\nto the bottom loop-back 0,\n\n39\n00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:17.264\nthere's 172180/1 as well, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:22.182\nSo when I pinged from this\ndevice over to 172.16.16.1,\n\n41\n00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:26.058\nwhich IP address does it ping from, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Gee,\n\n42\n00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:31.150\nI probably don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Yes well, see, that is the problem.\n\n43\n00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.410\n&gt;&gt; It's hard to figure it out, yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Most of us do not understand and\n\n45\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.580\ndo not know which IP\naddress that goes out from,\n\n46\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.110\nright?\n&gt;&gt; That is right\n\n47\n00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.900\n&gt;&gt; When you and I send a regular ping\n\n48\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.280\nfrom our machines, and it goes out, and\n\n49\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.020\nit hits someplace across the Internet,\nand comes back, well we know something.\n\n50\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.670\nWe only have one IP\naddress on my machine so\n\n51\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.800\nwe know the source IP address is mine.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n52\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.410\n&gt;&gt; But now,\n\n53\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.600\nZach, I'm showing you three.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n54\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.950\n&gt;&gt; And so which one is it?\n\n55\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.390\nSee, that's the problem,\nit's that we don't exactly understand\n\n56\n00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.710\nwhich one it really is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n57\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.710\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n58\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.430\nwhat essentially ends up happening here,\nwhen we issue out a pig, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.680\nA ping, I said pig, I think.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.110\n&gt;&gt; When we issue out a ping-\n\n61\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.900\n&gt;&gt; Don't send out a pig.\n\n62\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Don't send out a pig,\n\n63\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.470\nit's not gonna work.\n&gt;&gt; But when we send out a ping, whatever\n\n64\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.560\ninterface the ping exits from,\nokay, goes out of,\n\n65\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.090\nthat will be the source IP address of\nthat ping, or any traffic that goes out.\n\n66\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.480\nThat will be that,\nif it originates from the router.\n\n67\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.075\nIf the router were sending it out,\nlet's say, to 172.14.0.10, right?\n\n68\n00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:40.839\nWell, it would send it out as 172.14.0.1,\nokay?\n\n69\n00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:48.710\nSo remember that this is about\nthe source being the router itself.\n\n70\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.810\nWhen we took a look at the network path,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.224\nAnd the data going from one device through\na couple of routers going to other device,\n\n72\n00:03:55.224 --> 00:03:59.515\nI said that the IP address doesn't change\nits source and destination IP address,\n\n73\n00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:00.969\nlayer three is protected.\n\n74\n00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.604\nWell, that's different than what we\nsee right here because this is now not\n\n75\n00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:10.830\noriginating as traffic goes through the\nrouter, this is now the router originating\n\n76\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.739\nthe traffic, which is what we started\nhere when we said ping 172.16.16.0, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.670\nSo now when we do something like that,\nwe've got to realize that over on,\n\n78\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.910\nwhen it replied back, that means that\nwhen we sent it from here, right?\n\n79\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.980\nIt went out.\n\n80\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.328\nThe route that we had inside\nthe table that said 172 16,\n\n81\n00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:42.095\nthat it goes out to 172.16.1.\n\n82\n00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:47.112\nSo it went across 172.16.1,\nso it went across 172.16,\n\n83\n00:04:47.112 --> 00:04:51.054\nit went out, excuse me, 192.168.16.1.\n\n84\n00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:55.190\nOn NY1 over here, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.030\nIt received it right here, and\n\n86\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.110\nit knew because it was directly connected,\nand it responded here.\n\n87\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.250\nThen it sent it back over here, and went\nback to, well, as we go up to NYEDGE1,\n\n88\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.050\nwent back up this device, and it answered.\n\n89\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.037\nSo everything was good, that's why we\nend up getting the successful replies\n\n90\n00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:18.020\nthat we got.\n\n91\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.588\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n92\n00:05:18.588 --> 00:05:20.050\nAll right, so that make sense.\n\n93\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.780\nAt least, I hope it makes sense to you,\nit's really what the hope is, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.079\nNow, once we get it, now,\n\n95\n00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:33.389\nI configure an IP address over on NYEDGE1,\n\n96\n00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.574\nwhich was 172.14.0.1, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:38.574 --> 00:05:42.110\nWell, it's in the same configuration.\n\n98\n00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.014\nI've configured it on NYEDGE1, but\n\n99\n00:05:45.014 --> 00:05:50.835\nnotice it's not right here in the router,\nin the routing table of NYWAN1.\n\n100\n00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:58.211\nSo now when I ping 172.14.0.1, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:58.211 --> 00:06:00.585\nEven though I know it's on NYEDGE1,\n\n102\n00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:03.860\nand we were able to ping\nfrom the other side, right?\n\n103\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.726\nWe showed you how to ping from\n192.168.16.1 all the way through\n\n104\n00:06:09.726 --> 00:06:11.360\n172.16.16.1.\n\n105\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.480\nWell, now notice that I'm\ngetting these five periods here,\n\n106\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.560\nwhich means it's answering, but\nit's not because it's successful.\n\n107\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.490\nIt's essentially saying, no,\nI'm not answering for this.\n\n108\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.960\nAnd that's because it's not\nin this routing table here,\n\n109\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.570\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n110\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.290\n&gt;&gt; So if it's not in the routing table,\n\n111\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.420\nI can not ping it.\n\n112\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.290\nAnd that's why you have to make sure\nthat you configure it on both ends.\n\n113\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.900\n&gt;&gt; On both ends.\n\n114\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.619\n&gt;&gt; So if I do the config terminal,\n\n115\n00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:44.526\nnow I can go IP route 172.14.0.0.\n\n116\n00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:49.092\nAnd then we'll do a 24 bit\nsubnet mask in the same way I\n\n117\n00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:52.630\nconfigured it in that interface.\n\n118\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.660\nNow, I'm gonna tell it\nto go across to 16.1,\n\n119\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.272\nthe next hop, or\nnext device along that path.\n\n120\n00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:09.638\nNow, if I issue out a ping, 172.14.0.1,\n\n121\n00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:14.530\nnow notice that we are successful, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.750\nSo if you get where you get what we\ncall unidirectional traffic, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.230\nThat's what we just showed you.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.450\n&gt;&gt; It pinged one way, but\n\n125\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.690\nI couldn't ping the other way,\nback the way I needed to.\n\n126\n00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.031\nIt's because I did not set up\nthe static routing on both ends, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:34.700\nSo static routing, make sure you configure\nit on both routers if you do this.\n\n128\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.670\nIt's very important that you do that.\n\n129\n00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.743\nRemember that even though this\nis a great way to do routing,\n\n130\n00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:44.009\nit's only great in certain scenarios,\nokay?\n\n131\n00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.383\nThe very fact is if you have a network\nthat really isn't gonna grow much bigger,\n\n132\n00:07:48.383 --> 00:07:52.563\nokay, static routing is the way to go\nbecause it doesn't generate any extra\n\n133\n00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:53.175\ntraffic.\n\n134\n00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:55.941\nIt's set,\nall it has to do is a look up, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:55.941 --> 00:08:00.071\nIt goes okay, there's the list, it says\nsend it up this interface to that device,\n\n136\n00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:01.640\nwe're ready to go.\n\n137\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.970\nSo it doesn't have to actually\ncalculate or do anything, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.453\nBut it does mean though that every\ntime there's a change in network, and\n\n139\n00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:13.040\nit does change,\nyou have to manually configure it.\n\n140\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.710\nSo it's a much more hands on type of\nconfiguration, that you're doing, yes.\n\n141\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.700\n&gt;&gt; Is dynamic more flexible?\n\n142\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.680\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay, and\n\n143\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.790\nthat's what we wanna talk about as well,\nokay?\n\n144\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.960\nSo if you do know that your network\nis gonna continue to grow and\n\n145\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.940\nchange because you realize\nthat the future is coming,\n\n146\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.660\ndynamic routing protocols\nare the way to go, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.060\nSo let's make sure we understand.\n\n148\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.770\nStatic means I manage or\nI administrate that I do it manually.\n\n149\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.140\nConfigure it, I configure it all.\n\n150\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.690\nThings change,\nI have to change that with us.\n\n151\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:52.370\nBut routing protocols allow for\nthe router to turn on a protocol and\n\n152\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.230\nto learn about the networks\nfrom other routers.\n\n153\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:03.120\nSo they become learning devices as long as\nthey're using the same routing protocols,\n\n154\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.510\nthen they can learn about routes from\nother devices and put that into their\n\n155\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.490\nown routing table as well.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n156\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.050\n&gt;&gt; And the advantage of that\n\n157\n00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.110\nis a couple of things, right?\n\n158\n00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.290\nOne, let's talk about\nthat idea of scalability.\n\n159\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.860\nAs the network changes, it means if\nthe network only changes off of one\n\n160\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.990\nof those interfaces on some\nother router downstream, well,\n\n161\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.120\nif all those routers are using\nthe same routing protocol,\n\n162\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.010\nit means the routers that are this\nway from that router will update.\n\n163\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.500\nIt will actually just continue to update,\nokay?\n\n164\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.380\nSo the great thing is,\n\n165\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.740\nthat means even if it changes,\nI'll get the updates eventually.\n\n166\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.270\nBut some of these dynamic\nrouting protocols are not quick,\n\n167\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.800\nIt can take a long time before the update.\n\n168\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.100\nAnd there is also opening up to\na possibility of what we call\n\n169\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.350\nrouting loops that can happen.\n\n170\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.930\nAnd routing loops are pretty bad, and the\nvery fact that routes or data that gets\n\n171\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.510\nsent and gets into a loop will never go\nanywhere except in that particular loop.\n\n172\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:04.750\nSo there are problems with it if\nthey are not set up correctly.\n\n173\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.532\nSo there is a challenge to doing\nsomething like the idea of configuring\n\n174\n00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:12.050\ndynamic routing protocols as well.\n\n175\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:17.339\nNow before we get into that idea of\nsetting up a dynamic routing protocol,\n\n176\n00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:22.455\nwe wanna come back and take a look at,\nwell the idea of well these numbers\n\n177\n00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:28.284\nright here inside of the bracket,\nwhich is this one here is 120 and then /6.\n\n178\n00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:31.785\nRemember the first number is gonna\nbe your administrative distance,\n\n179\n00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:33.400\nthe second number your metric.\n\n180\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.070\nSo let's talk about in this term here,\nokay?\n\n181\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.720\nIn which we have different routing\nprotocol rankings, is what we can do here.\n\n182\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.460\nLet me see if I can select those and\n\n183\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.980\nmove them just a little bit closer,\nand so that we can see this.\n\n184\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.890\nThere are a lot more administrative\ndistances than what we see.\n\n185\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.180\nBut at the CCENT level these\nare the ones I would memorize.\n\n186\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.962\nJust making sure that we could do this.\n\n187\n00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:06.549\nAll right, so let's kind of understand\nwhat we are talking about here in terms of\n\n188\n00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:08.150\nthe idea of ranking.\n\n189\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.640\nOkay, when we start to actually\nimplement dynamic routing protocols,\n\n190\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.960\nbecause there's several of them,\nyou have to trust them some way, somehow.\n\n191\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.050\nYou can't use them all at the same time.\n\n192\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.490\nSo only one gets sent to\nthe routing table, all right.\n\n193\n00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.370\nSo in the administrative distance and\nthe diagram that I have over here\n\n194\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.430\non the left-hand side, you'll see\na couple of different elements, and\n\n195\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.850\nthen we'll get over here\nat the right hand side.\n\n196\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.930\nWe're not gonna worry about\nthat right now, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:39.680\nLet's say that we start at router\none to get data to network A, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.590\nSo, if we were to do something like\nthis here, and to take a look at this,\n\n199\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.730\nokay, I could actually have on\nall these routers possible.\n\n200\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.180\nTurned on let's say.\n\n201\n00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.480\nRIP and\nlet's say EIGRP as an example, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.840\nWell if I do that they both end up, really\nwill give me a path to Network A, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.670\nThe whole goal of routing, right,\n\n204\n00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.660\nis to give you the best\npossible path to Network A.\n\n205\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.360\nThe problem that you and I have with\nthe idea of different routing protocols It\n\n206\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.250\nunderstands that idea is a best path\nto the destination as being different.\n\n207\n00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.010\nSo for example, RIP here,\nis based on hop count.\n\n208\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.480\nAnd that means, how many routers do I\nhave to go through to get to network A?\n\n209\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.200\nThe less number of routers that it is,\nthe better it is.\n\n210\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.380\nSo if I were to take RIP here and\nwe were to start at Router 1,\n\n211\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.230\nthere's two possible paths, right?\n\n212\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.100\nOkay, there's actually one that goes up\nthis way, to Router2, Router4 and then\n\n213\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:50.040\nNetwork A, there's also one, that goes to\nRouter3, Router4 and then the Network A.\n\n214\n00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.210\nWell, according to RIP, okay,\n\n215\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.300\nthe only thing that counts is\nthe number of hops in between.\n\n216\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.020\nSo for RIP, this has one,\ntwo and you're there, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.257\nThis way one, two, and\nyou're there and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n218\n00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:09.450\nThe problem that we have is one path\nis actually faster than the other.\n\n219\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.980\nOkay, so when you take a look at\nthe speeds that I'm implementing here,\n\n220\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:21.780\n256 kilobits per second is a lot slower\nthan 100 megabit connection, okay?\n\n221\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.550\nAnd 100 megabit connection, if you're\nsitting there going there's no way, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.420\nI understand, I'm doing this for\nthe sake of emphasis.\n\n223\n00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.280\nYou can change it to 10\nmegabits if you want to,\n\n224\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.140\nif you wanna feel better about it.\n\n225\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.200\nEither way is fine right.\n\n226\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.660\nSo this path actually\nis potentially better.\n\n227\n00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.920\nThe rip only looks at the idea\nof number of hops in between.\n\n228\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.460\nSo when it says two in this way and\ntwo in this way.\n\n229\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.120\nWell what does it do\nbecause they're both two.\n\n230\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.490\nIt just does what we call equal cost\nload balancing Let's just divide it up,\n\n231\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.030\nbecause both sides are actually equal.\n\n232\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.140\nBut you and I actually can see this.\n\n233\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.650\nIt sent along router three and\nrouter four, this would be a better path.\n\n234\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.510\nBut router rip says what,\nno both paths are equal.\n\n235\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.170\nThat's essentially what happens, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.230\nWell OSPF though really takes into\nbandwidth as a consideration.\n\n237\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.240\nAnd there's a mathematical formula, we're\nnot getting into it at this point here.\n\n238\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.960\nBut essentially, its basis of its\nmetric is based on, well, bandwidth.\n\n239\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.110\nSo when OSPF looks at it and says hey,\nthere's two paths to get over here.\n\n240\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.670\nWell, OSPF says,\nlet's take the faster path.\n\n241\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.290\nThe one with the biggest bandwidth, okay?\n\n242\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.170\nWell, that makes sense, right?\n\n243\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.950\nWhy would you take a slow path\nwhen you can take a fast path?\n\n244\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.580\nReally makes better sense here, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n245\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.580\n&gt;&gt; So that is very possible\n\n246\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.610\nthat that's potentially a better path.\n\n247\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:50.006\nSo SPF does actually differentiate between\nthis because of the bandwidth, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:53.380\nEIGRP though,\n\n249\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.410\nEIGRP says we'll do a combination\nof things, bandwidth and delay.\n\n250\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.290\nNow what the heck is delay?\n\n251\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.990\nWhat is that about, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.790\nWell what it actually does is it says,\n\n253\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.640\nthere's something that's gonna\nhappen in between these routers.\n\n254\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.130\nOkay which OSPF doesn't account for.\n\n255\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.580\nIt knows that the bandwidth is better,\nokay?\n\n256\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.850\nIt knows that it's possibly\nbetter over here too.\n\n257\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.070\nBut there's also something else that\nhappens in between these routers.\n\n258\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.610\nWhen I go from this side to here,\nI'm gonna lose something in between.\n\n259\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.820\nIt's called delay.\n\n260\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.580\nIt's gonna take a little bit of time for\n\n261\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.840\nme to get from here to here\nIt's gonna slow down here.\n\n262\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.710\nThen as it slows down, and\n\n263\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.490\nI try to send it on here, it's gonna\ntake a little bit more time, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.230\nSo that's delay as well.\n\n265\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.564\nSo it now has both those to consider.\n\n266\n00:15:42.564 --> 00:15:47.220\nBut it says, look, I can start off really\nslow, and slow down when I get here.\n\n267\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.551\nAnd then I'm slowing down already and\nthen I have to come across here.\n\n268\n00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:54.325\nAnd I'm gonna probably slow down a little\nmore and then I can get to network A.\n\n269\n00:15:54.325 --> 00:15:59.830\nSo know you have what we call a composite\ntype of metric to go across, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.920\nSo that is also a possibility.\n\n271\n00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.080\nNow just looking at those three without\nhaving to move my head right now, okay,\n\n272\n00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.688\nlooking at those three what\nare we trying to do here\n\n273\n00:16:08.688 --> 00:16:11.230\nwith the administrative distance?\n\n274\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.690\nWhat it's saying is if there is\na choice between these three here and\n\n275\n00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.590\nthey are all configured on router one,\nwell only one of them\n\n276\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.370\ncan get into the routing table.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n277\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all of them say I've got the best\n\n278\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.850\nI've got it but\nthere has to be a tie breaker for\n\n279\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.140\nthe routers to decide what\ngoes into the routing table.\n\n280\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.040\nAnd that tie breaker is what we call\nthe administrative distance, okay,\n\n281\n00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.200\nwhere we rank that\nbelievability of the protocol.\n\n282\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.190\nWell, in the way that we have it in Cisco\nland, right, and probably standardized now\n\n283\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:51.380\nas well, is that EIGRP has\nan administrative distance of 90, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.930\nSo even when you compare that\nto the pure bandwidth of 110,\n\n285\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:01.600\nif you were running EIGRP and\nOSPF, EIGRP will be preferred and\n\n286\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.740\nthat's what will get entered into the\nrouting table instead it will pretty much\n\n287\n00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.790\nfollow the same path as OSPF but\nthat's what will get chosen in between.\n\n288\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.320\nBut even in between RIP and EIGRP, well,\n\n289\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.930\nEIGRP will get entered in to the routing\ntable instead It is going across the same\n\n290\n00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:24.190\npath because it is saying I've got\na better ranking than you do, okay.\n\n291\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.710\nNow behind my head here this is where\nit gets a little bit more challenging,\n\n292\n00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.770\nright, notice this though, okay,\n\n293\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.990\nwhen you see a 1 as an administrative\ndistance, it is a static route.\n\n294\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.650\nNow why the heck would\na 1 be a static route?\n\n295\n00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.520\nI can set a 1 as static route and\nsay I wanna go across this way,\n\n296\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.700\nI don't care what all the routing\nprotocols would do when it hits this,\n\n297\n00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.980\nI am actually telling\nit to choose this way.\n\n298\n00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.650\nAnd when we administratively configure\nthat, we're saying we know better\n\n299\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.950\nthan what the routing protocols\nare discovering on their own.\n\n300\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.810\nTrue or false this is the way that\nCisco had decided, they're saying look,\n\n301\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.120\nif you statically configured it,\nyou have a good reason to do so, so\n\n302\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.260\nlet's go with your good reason to do so\nand\n\n303\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.530\nwe'll set it as the administrative\ndistance of 1 by default.\n\n304\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.750\nNow the great thing is all these\nadministrative distance can change,\n\n305\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.700\nyou can configure them to change but\n\n306\n00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.700\nthe reality is you shouldn't change\nthem unless you have a good reason to.\n\n307\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.800\nAnd then of course the last one there\nis directly connected, okay, so\n\n308\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.460\nif you do that they're saying zero.\n\n309\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.200\nSo, they're saying if you're\ndirectly connected to that\n\n310\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.698\nthen don't even worry about to\nthat network that it's going to,\n\n311\n00:18:29.698 --> 00:18:33.790\nthen you don't even have to worry\nabout administrative distance at all.\n\n312\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.510\nBut memorize these, there's a lot more to\ncome as you start moving on in your Cisco\n\n313\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.890\nstudies but for right now,\nthese are the basic ones you should know.\n\n314\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.815\nNow what happens if you see\nan administrative distance of 255?\n\n315\n00:18:45.815 --> 00:18:49.997\nThat means it's not gonna ever get into\nthe routing table at all so usually for\n\n316\n00:18:49.997 --> 00:18:53.211\nus anything above 200 means it is so\nout of the ballpark,\n\n317\n00:18:53.211 --> 00:18:57.158\nthat all these other protocols\nare really gonna fit in before anything.\n\n318\n00:18:57.158 --> 00:19:01.001\nBut usually the reason why we do that is\nwe want that route to be in there, but\n\n319\n00:19:01.001 --> 00:19:04.661\nthe only reason why we keep it in there\nis that we don't want it to get into\n\n320\n00:19:04.661 --> 00:19:08.010\nthe routing table unless\nall these other ones fail.\n\n321\n00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.290\nSo, when you set something like that up\nyou might set it up to be like 190 or\n\n322\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.340\nsomething if you want to do 200\nit actually works very well.\n\n323\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.560\nIf you do this and let's say that all the\nother routing protocols for one reason or\n\n324\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.360\nanother failed on the routing protocol,\nwell then, that router can get\n\n325\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.372\nentered into the routing table or\nthat route can get entered in.\n\n326\n00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:29.243\nAnd that is like I said it's\ncalled a floating static route,\n\n327\n00:19:29.243 --> 00:19:32.959\nis what that one's called, and allows\nyou to still have a route available even\n\n328\n00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:36.141\nif the routing protocols end up\nfailing for one reason or another.\n\n329\n00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:40.397\nBut once again you'll learn more about\nthat in the CCNA Routing and Switching,\n\n330\n00:19:40.397 --> 00:19:44.653\nbut overall though that's where the\nadministrative distance really does help\n\n331\n00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:45.300\nus, okay.\n\n332\n00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.961\nAll right so now we want to take a look\nat configuring routing protocols\n\n333\n00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:52.726\ninside of our lab environment, okay, so\n\n334\n00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:56.950\nnow we're ready to start\nconfiguring dynamic routing.\n\n335\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.660\nWe're gonna choose RIP because it's\nactually one of the easiest ones\n\n336\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.680\nat the CCNT level to describe what\nrouting protocols really do without\n\n337\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.630\nall the complexities of understanding the\nother metrics and some of the other things\n\n338\n00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.590\nthat have to be done so we're gonna\nuse RIP as our initial example.\n\n339\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.130\nThe great thing about this is\nthat in our configuration and\n\n340\n00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.690\nwhat we're doing and\neverything else that we're doing,\n\n341\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.320\nwe don't have to configure a ton okay to\nget a routing protocol up and running.\n\n342\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.568\nSo, let me show you what I am talking\nabout, we're going to use NYEDGE1 and\n\n343\n00:20:29.568 --> 00:20:35.644\nwe're going to begin to configure RIP on\nNYEDGE1, okay, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n344\n00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:42.789\nAll right, so that we add in another\nroute in here, you saw one that said,\n\n345\n00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:45.160\nloop back zero 172.18 something here.\n\n346\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.630\nLet me go ahead and create another one\nhere and we'll talk about this for\n\n347\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.190\na moment as well.\n\n348\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.610\nLet me get into our\nglobal configuration and\n\n349\n00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.031\nthen let's do loop I'm just gonna do 10,\n\n350\n00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:02.497\njust as an example, IP address and\n\n351\n00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:09.203\nwe'll do 202.201.200.199\nlet's just do that.\n\n352\n00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:16.343\nOr maybe not, it not take it it did okay,\n\n353\n00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:22.050\nI just wanna make sure it actually took it\nand then we'll do a no shut down, okay.\n\n354\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.620\nNow I had previously configured that loop\nback in there in your lab and we'll have\n\n355\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.410\nyou configure it right now, I just didn't\nrealize until we did that show interface,\n\n356\n00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.650\nI apparently forgot to\ntake that thing off.\n\n357\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.595\nSo, we'll just add another one in here for\nnow.\n\n358\n00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:40.890\nDo show IP Interface brief, just so\n\n359\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.840\nthat we can verify if all of our addresses\nare there, so here is the one that you'll\n\n360\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.210\nconfigure when you get ready to do this,\nand I need to turn that one on.\n\n361\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.850\nAnd then, loop back 10,\n\n362\n00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.770\nhere is the one I just configured let me\ngo ahead an turn that one on as well.\n\n363\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.940\nInterface loop back zero and\nthen no shutdown here.\n\n364\n00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.943\nAll right, so\nnow that we've got these interfaces,\n\n365\n00:22:02.943 --> 00:22:07.161\nremember that they're really\nrepresenting different networks, okay.\n\n366\n00:22:07.161 --> 00:22:12.257\nSo now I want routing protocols or\nthe routing protocol RIP to learn\n\n367\n00:22:12.257 --> 00:22:17.092\nthese routes to be able to pass\nout to other RIP routers, okay.\n\n368\n00:22:17.092 --> 00:22:21.054\nSo that is what we\nare configuring next here, so\n\n369\n00:22:21.054 --> 00:22:27.611\nfrom the global configuration okay we're\ngoing to type in router RIP, okay.\n\n370\n00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:31.906\nNow there's two versions to RIP, there is\nRIP version 1, there is RIP version 2,\n\n371\n00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:34.365\nI was about to say two\nthat's not going to work.\n\n372\n00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:38.710\nRIP version 2 that's out there,\ntoday, if you're using it,\n\n373\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.150\nyou're probably using RIP version 2,\n\n374\n00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.880\nthe difference between them is one only\ndoes Class 4 routing and that means if\n\n375\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.620\nyou're using a Class A address, it'll\nonly take a look at the first eight bits.\n\n376\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.630\nThen if you're using Class B address,\nonly the first 16 bites and then if you're\n\n377\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.760\nusing Class C, the first 24 bits, it\ndoesn't do anything with the subnetting,\n\n378\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.930\nit doesn't do anything like that, okay.\n\n379\n00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.810\nSo it doesn't like following that, so\n\n380\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.600\nI'm gonna change up our lab\njust a little bit because\n\n381\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.190\nit doesn't require us to do RIP version 2,\nbut we're going to do that anyways, okay.\n\n382\n00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.690\nSo here's RIP version 2, okay, and\nthat's all you do to choose the difference\n\n383\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.820\nbetween them this is what you do,\nRIP version 2, it's right there, okay.\n\n384\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.820\nNow the other thing that you want to do,\n\n385\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.350\nbecause it is a Class 4\nrouting protocol by default,\n\n386\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.350\nis that it does what we also call\nsummarization or automatic summarization.\n\n387\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.484\nIt takes anything that it\nsees as being subnets, and\n\n388\n00:23:32.484 --> 00:23:36.828\nit summarizes them to the class anyways,\nso I don't want to see that, so\n\n389\n00:23:36.828 --> 00:23:39.416\nautomatically every single time, okay.\n\n390\n00:23:41.945 --> 00:23:45.388\nThat I run RIP version 2,\nalways just type this in,\n\n391\n00:23:45.388 --> 00:23:49.670\nsomething leave it in the way\nthat I want it typed in, okay.\n\n392\n00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.720\nSo that's what we do from that point,\nokay.\n\n393\n00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.516\nSo what do I have to do now?\n\n394\n00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:57.726\nWell, now I can use\nthe interfaces up here, and\n\n395\n00:23:57.726 --> 00:24:02.750\nI see with the IP addresses, and\nI can begin typing them in there.\n\n396\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.730\nSo this network is the key.\n\n397\n00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.055\nAnd then let's do 192.168.16.0.\n\n398\n00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:12.230\nNow, I'm gonna do a question mark\n\n399\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.100\nto show you a couple of different things\nif it actually allows us to do so, okay?\n\n400\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.350\nSo this one doesn't do it.\n\n401\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.950\nOn older routing protocols,\nit may actually say go ahead, and\n\n402\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.019\nalso type in the subnet mask.\n\n403\n00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:26.000\nSo sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.\n\n404\n00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.180\nOn this one it just says I'll deal\nwith that the way that I see it.\n\n405\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.090\nSo this one doesn't let us do it.\n\n406\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.938\nSo then I can do network\n\n407\n00:24:35.938 --> 00:24:41.004\n172.14.0.0, and\n\n408\n00:24:41.004 --> 00:24:47.701\nthen network 172.18.0.0.\n\n409\n00:24:47.701 --> 00:24:57.393\nAnd then network 202.201.200.0.\n\n410\n00:24:57.393 --> 00:24:59.967\nAll right, believe it or not,\n\n411\n00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:06.040\nrouting is actually now working\nin terms of the routing protocol.\n\n412\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.907\nIf I type in do show ip protocols,\n\n413\n00:25:16.052 --> 00:25:20.747\nI can now see that the routing\nprotocol that is turned on here,\n\n414\n00:25:20.747 --> 00:25:23.400\nright, is actually the rip.\n\n415\n00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.690\nOkay, so there it is.\n\n416\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.980\nYou can also see some of the other\nadditional information, and\n\n417\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.560\nthis is part of what rip does.\n\n418\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.060\nNotice is sending out\nupdates every 30 seconds.\n\n419\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.730\nNow the update is actually a little bit\nmore incredible here than you think.\n\n420\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.510\nThe reason why I'm actually\nsaying that is because\n\n421\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.070\nit's the full routing table is what\nit's sending out every 30 seconds.\n\n422\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.190\nSo big deal, Ronnie,\nthere's four networks here.\n\n423\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.800\nBut remember, networks can get pretty big.\n\n424\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.520\nSo if there's a network with 20 routes\nin here, it's sending out all 20 routes\n\n425\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.440\nevery 30 seconds to its neighbor to make\nsure that everything is actually going on.\n\n426\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.640\nAnd you can see right here where\nit's actually saying sending and\n\n427\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.850\nreceiving here.\n\n428\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.830\nIt's already done this twice in\nthe time that I had it up and\n\n429\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.060\nrunning to the time I hit this command.\n\n430\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.090\nSo it is a busy, busy protocol as\nyou start seeing it, too, okay?\n\n431\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.930\nAlso of course, it has,\nwell, timers, too, okay?\n\n432\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.890\nSo there's a bunch of different\nthings that happen as well.\n\n433\n00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.860\nSo invalid after 180 seconds.\n\n434\n00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.690\nIf it doesn't hear from that\nnetwork in not three minutes,\n\n435\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.380\nokay, it normally says what?\n\n436\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.350\nWell, obviously, it's not there.\n\n437\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.410\nBut just because of that,\nI'm not gonna get rid of it yet, okay?\n\n438\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.928\nWhat it actually is gonna do is say,\n\n439\n00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:40.020\nwell, let me just hold on to\nit just a little bit longer.\n\n440\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.020\nSo it again will hold on to 180 seconds.\n\n441\n00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.391\nAnd then if it doesn't hear from it\nafter about four or six minutes or so,\n\n442\n00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:50.600\nwhatever it says here, that'd be\nfour minutes, right, 240, 60, yeah.\n\n443\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.620\nSo it says it flushes it after\nan additional four minutes, so\n\n444\n00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:59.610\nit can take a long time before it really\never gets rid of it, but it's trying to.\n\n445\n00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.987\nSo it actually is listening for\nall this stuff, okay.\n\n446\n00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.510\nThe other thing that we can also confirm,\nof course, is what we're routing for.\n\n447\n00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.640\nAnd notice all the networks\nare showing up.\n\n448\n00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.980\nAnd you can now see where it's actually\njust kind of lined up along class B,\n\n449\n00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.653\nclass C, network so far.\n\n450\n00:27:17.653 --> 00:27:21.411\nOkay, and that's fine because well,\nactually,\n\n451\n00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:23.800\nwe're not really working\nwith that too much today.\n\n452\n00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.120\nBut that's the normal way to do it, okay.\n\n453\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.870\nSo we'll go ahead and\nmake sure that those are in there.\n\n454\n00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:33.344\nNow that I've got that running,\nthe problem that I have is simple as\n\n455\n00:27:33.344 --> 00:27:37.920\nI need another router to begin\nlearning routes, too, okay.\n\n456\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.310\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n457\n00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.830\nSo I'll run NYEDGE2 here, see I can\nget this one up and running here.\n\n458\n00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.960\nThere we go.\n\n459\n00:27:51.614 --> 00:27:53.430\nCome on, you can do it.\n\n460\n00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.698\nSometimes, you know,\nyou have to kinda wiggle it a second here.\n\n461\n00:28:00.491 --> 00:28:02.270\nThere we go, okay.\n\n462\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:07.030\nSo over on NYEDGE1,\nit went back to NYEDGE1, didn't it?\n\n463\n00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.503\nWhere's NYEDGE2?\n\n464\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.604\nThere we go,\n\n465\n00:28:14.604 --> 00:28:18.070\nI was like sometimes you just have to play\nwith it until it actually works here.\n\n466\n00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.346\nAnd let's get into enable and\nthen our global configuration mode.\n\n467\n00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:29.202\nAnd now just go ahead and\nstart typing in router rip.\n\n468\n00:28:31.779 --> 00:28:38.831\nAll right, let's do version 2,\nand then no auto, -summary.\n\n469\n00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:45.007\nAll right, now I haven't\nconfigured anything else, right,\n\n470\n00:28:45.007 --> 00:28:47.360\njust that at this particular point.\n\n471\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.461\nNow if everything is actually working and\nNYEDGE2 and\n\n472\n00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:53.650\nNYEDGE1, they're connected,\nthey can actually work together.\n\n473\n00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.450\nThey can do what they need to do,\n\n474\n00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:02.310\nshow ip route here.\n\n475\n00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.956\nSo we'll see here in a moment.\n\n476\n00:29:03.956 --> 00:29:05.580\nNothing has actually shown up yet, so\n\n477\n00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.840\nwe may have to give it just\na little bit more time here.\n\n478\n00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.330\nBut let's go ahead and configure\nthe routes that we have on NYEDGE2 here.\n\n479\n00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:16.100\nSo let's do, let me make sure\nhere I'm telling you right, yeah.\n\n480\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.957\nSo let's also configure one more,\ncuz I need one connection here.\n\n481\n00:29:20.957 --> 00:29:22.300\n172.14.0.0.\n\n482\n00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:27.896\nAnd then we'll do one more, which is gonna\n\n483\n00:29:27.896 --> 00:29:33.991\nbe 192.168.16, No wait, yep, 16.0.\n\n484\n00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:38.490\nI'll try to tell you\nall the right networks.\n\n485\n00:29:44.796 --> 00:29:47.720\nNow we will do a show ip route.\n\n486\n00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.162\nAnd this time, we're gonna do\na little bit of filtering here.\n\n487\n00:29:50.162 --> 00:29:53.070\nWe're gonna tell it to begin where\n\n488\n00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.500\nthe gateway statement is instead\nof showing the whole thing, okay.\n\n489\n00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.460\nNow notice that it took away\nthe legend at the top here?\n\n490\n00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.330\nWe began with the word Gateway.\n\n491\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:09.980\nBut now notice, there they are, okay,\nwe're now seeing rip routes come in.\n\n492\n00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.500\nAnd you can now see where,\noops, sorry, okay.\n\n493\n00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.463\nYou can now, [LAUGH] maybe not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n494\n00:30:16.463 --> 00:30:17.872\n&gt;&gt; It's like impossible.\n\n495\n00:30:19.847 --> 00:30:25.125\nApparently my fingers are fatter\nthan I think they are, okay.\n\n496\n00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.370\nSo here's a rip route for\nme to get to 172.18.\n\n497\n00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.400\nNotice that what's happened here, right,\n\n498\n00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.240\naccording to rip,\nthere's two possibilities here, okay.\n\n499\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.430\nAnd that is because it's seeing\nthis idea of there's one router but\n\n500\n00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:42.586\nthere's two interfaces that will\nget me to 172.18.0, okay, network.\n\n501\n00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:46.370\nSo it's gonna do a load balance\nacross both of those routes.\n\n502\n00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:52.040\nThe same thing over here on the one\nthat I also just created as well, okay.\n\n503\n00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.640\nNow you're wondering about\nwhat that loopback is,\n\n504\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.145\nright, because I just created it.\n\n505\n00:30:56.145 --> 00:30:58.682\nIt's what we call a virtual interface.\n\n506\n00:30:58.682 --> 00:31:03.670\nNow we use them quite a bit as we get more\ninto the technically challenging things\n\n507\n00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.680\nin the CCMP.\n\n508\n00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:10.270\nBut for right now, what we can do is we\ncan mimic essentially other interfaces,\n\n509\n00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.750\nvirtual interfaces, off of that router.\n\n510\n00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.330\nAnd that way we can test for\nmultiple routes and\n\n511\n00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.760\nverify that we can get them there if\nwe believe that they're all connected.\n\n512\n00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.110\nSo it allows me to set these up.\n\n513\n00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.582\nAnd so that's exactly what\nI've done here is to try and\n\n514\n00:31:22.582 --> 00:31:24.680\nshow that we can actually do that.\n\n515\n00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.180\nSo now once we have the routing\nactually configured and done, okay,\n\n516\n00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.280\nthe way that we want to, let's verify\nby just doing a couple of pings here.\n\n517\n00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.740\nSo on NYEDGE2, remember I want to try and\n\n518\n00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.920\nping 172.18.1, and notice that\nI can actually ping from there.\n\n519\n00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.232\nGo to NYWAN1 here.\n\n520\n00:31:48.849 --> 00:31:53.751\nLet's see if I can ping 172 on WAN1, .14,\n\n521\n00:31:53.751 --> 00:31:57.034\ncuz that was also one that we had.\n\n522\n00:31:57.034 --> 00:32:00.256\nSo this was a static route,\nso now we have dynamic and\n\n523\n00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:04.371\nwe have static routing Also ending\nthat working for us too, okay?\n\n524\n00:32:04.371 --> 00:32:08.628\nSo, when all that as she comes down\nto play and doing everything else,\n\n525\n00:32:08.628 --> 00:32:11.780\ncan you run static and\ndynamic routing protocols?\n\n526\n00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.000\nYes, okay?\n\n527\n00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.790\nAll that can be done very easily, okay?\n\n528\n00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.000\nThe only thing that you want to be careful\nof at this particular point in time,\n\n529\n00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.250\nis to realize that you want to make sure\nthat if you're gonna run these routing\n\n530\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.880\nprotocols between to routers,\nmake sure you have that common network and\n\n531\n00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.500\nthat you set up the routing protocol\nbetween the one that's actually running.\n\n532\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.520\nSo for me it was at 11714 network,\nthat's actually running in between these.\n\n533\n00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.850\nIf I didn't have that one, then they\naren't gonna be able to communicate.\n\n534\n00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.210\nSo once that's done they're\nnow sharing information and\n\n535\n00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.790\nthey'll do so every 30 seconds here, okay?\n\n536\n00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:49.320\nSo, that will allow us to see\nenough of understanding at least\n\n537\n00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.300\nthe basics of dynamic routing protocols\nworking, as well as the idea of\n\n538\n00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.120\nstatic routing protocols in\nwhich we've also set up too.\n\n539\n00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.340\nSo Zach, that's a good place for\nus to go and end this particular lab.\n\n540\n00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.540\nBecause it does show,\n\n541\n00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.110\nwell, both of them actually\nconfigure the way that we need to.\n\n542\n00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.590\nAnd now it's about you practicing and\ntrying to actually learn about\n\n543\n00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.660\nthe configurations as well.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job, Ronnie,\n\n544\n00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.390\nDescribe Routine Tables parts one and two.\n\n545\n00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.199\nAnd before we move on,\n\n546\n00:33:18.199 --> 00:33:20.740\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well no.\n\n547\n00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.160\nAt this point it is all about you\npracticing more than anything else, right?\n\n548\n00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.370\nUp to this point, if you've been watching\nalong the entire series, there should not\n\n549\n00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.586\nbe a day that you're going by without\nactually trying to get in and\n\n550\n00:33:32.586 --> 00:33:34.790\nconfigure routers and switches.\n\n551\n00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.410\nEvery day you should be\nspending time in that and\n\n552\n00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.920\nyou should be trying to do\nthis as quickly as you can.\n\n553\n00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.780\nThat is the only way to build\nthe muscle memory you need to for\n\n554\n00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.660\nthe exam, as you get ready for\nthat exam, okay?\n\n555\n00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.700\nInspect the routing table.\n\n556\n00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.930\nLearn about those seven elements\nthat we told you about.\n\n557\n00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:57.990\nMake sure you can identify them very\neasily, and be able to identify a path so\n\n558\n00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.680\nthat you can get to a certain\nnetwork that it points out.\n\n559\n00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.740\nKnow what the next top router is.\n\n560\n00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.680\nKnow what you're actually\ntaking a look at,\n\n561\n00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.140\ninside of the administrative distance or\nthe metric itself.\n\n562\n00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.020\nAll those are valuable tips for\nyou as you get ready for the exam as well.\n\n563\n00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.929\nSo do not overlook that,\ndo not stop practicing,\n\n564\n00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:21.270\nthat should be a daily thing at this point\nas you're getting ready for this exam.\n\n565\n00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.220\nIf you're not, you're hindering yourself.\n\n566\n00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.470\nAnd I don't know how\nelse to say that nicely.\n\n567\n00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.240\nYou are really hurting\nyourself because you've got to\n\n568\n00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.000\nbuild that muscle memory\ninto your fingertips.\n\n569\n00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.640\nThere is not enough time for\nyou to just guess anymore.\n\n570\n00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.540\nNow is the time for you to do so as\nyou're practicing, it's not the time for\n\n571\n00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.710\nyou to do so when you're on the exam.\n\n572\n00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:46.100\nSo do as much as you can,\nrun through this lab a couple of times.\n\n573\n00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.470\nRun through it five times,\nrun through it six times,\n\n574\n00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:52.140\nto the point where you've memorized it and\nknow what you're doing next.\n\n575\n00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.620\nAnd that is when you know that\nif you can do it perfectly and\n\n576\n00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.370\nthe way they have it in the lab.\n\n577\n00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.150\nThen you know that you're probably just\nabout ready for any type of static\n\n578\n00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.970\nconfiguration, or just the dynamic\nconfiguration of rip for the exam as well.\n\n579\n00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.920\nAnd that's kind of the easiest way that\nyou can gauge yourself and your progress.\n\n580\n00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.312\n&gt;&gt; Great advice Ronnie, thank so\n\n581\n00:35:10.312 --> 00:35:11.170\nvery much.\n\n582\n00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.114\nAnd by the way, the Cisco series\nRonnie's put together for you.\n\n583\n00:35:14.114 --> 00:35:18.525\nWatch them all, as he said, multiple\ntimes but work them, get in there and\n\n584\n00:35:18.525 --> 00:35:20.060\nactually work it.\n\n585\n00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.270\nAnd by the way,\nwhen you're inside that course library,\n\n586\n00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.150\nthousands of other videos\nare available to help you go further.\n\n587\n00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:30.670\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPRO,TV\nbecause ITPRO.TV is binge worthy.\n\n588\n00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.970\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n589\n00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.910\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again real soon.\n\n590\n00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:41.500\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.983\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.631\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, again.\n\n4\n00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:16.850\nThank you for choosing ITPro TV,\nwe're helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.560\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n6\n00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.940\nWe are going to configure\ninter-VLAN routing in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.090\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n8\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.130\nAnd Ronnie Wong is going\nto help us do that, Ronnie,\n\n9\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.330\ngood to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for being right here\n\n10\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.048\nand for helping me out as we continue\non in our CCENT journey together.\n\n11\n00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:36.853\nToday, we're gonna be taking\na look at iner-VLAN routing.\n\n12\n00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:38.720\nNow, I've held off on this,\n\n13\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.450\nthere are times I wanted to jump into\nit during our LAN switching episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.470\nBut it really doesn't involve LAN\nswitching as much as it involves of\n\n15\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.700\ncourse routing.\n\n16\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.890\nAnd that is because we need to\nbe able to route between VLANs.\n\n17\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.230\nAnd what we already talked about was\nthe idea inside of LAN switching\n\n18\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.430\nthat if I configure two different\nVLANs on that same physical switch.\n\n19\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.860\nThey cannot directly communicate\nwell between those two VLANs\n\n20\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.530\nwithout the help of a layer 3\ndevice such as a router, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.480\nSo today we're gonna show\nyou that configuration so\n\n22\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.450\nthat you can allow for the idea of\ninter-VLAN routing even between\n\n23\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.800\ntwo VLANs on the same switch as well.\n\n24\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.360\nI wanna show you two different\nways to accomplish this.\n\n25\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.200\nSo let's remind\n\n26\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.261\nyou of what I'm talking about here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n27\n00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.641\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll take a look on my screen, and\n\n28\n00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.800\nthis will help us out a little bit more,\nokay?\n\n29\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.190\nSo remember that when we started off\nin LAN switching we took essentially\n\n30\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.218\na single switch and\nthen we configured multiple VLANs on this.\n\n31\n00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:41.480\nThat's just generic,\nwe'll be using different VLAN numbers\n\n32\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.700\nwhen we get into\nthe configuration side of this.\n\n33\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.870\nBut for us, that means that each one\nof these is its own broadcast domain.\n\n34\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.700\nEssentially three different\nnetworks on this same switch.\n\n35\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.530\nWell, because they're three different\nnetworks, well, I cannot have\n\n36\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.130\none port over here directly communicate\nwith another port in another VLAN.\n\n37\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.730\nFor me do so I need to involve\na router to help us to do this, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.590\nThat router that we have allows us to\ndo what we call inter-VLAN routing.\n\n39\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.740\nBecause we are actually sending data\nfrom one network to another network.\n\n40\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.095\nSo what essentially ends up\nhappening at this particular point,\n\n41\n00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:23.803\nonce everything is configured.\n\n42\n00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:28.950\nIs that I can communicate\nbetween VLAN 10 going to VLAN\n\n43\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.522\n20 by going across that interface,\ngetting into the routing table,\n\n44\n00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:39.890\nand the routing table sending it back out.\n\n45\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.710\nAnd then getting accessed either\nto the wireless or into VLAN 20,\n\n46\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.510\nwhatever it might be, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.290\nSo all that is actually possible when\nwe start to do something like this as\n\n48\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.420\nwell, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n49\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Now, it actually does require us to do\n\n50\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.600\na couple of things because the router\n\n51\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.370\nwill actually do something that\nwe don't want it to do, okay?\n\n52\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.365\nRouters by default don't like this idea.\n\n53\n00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:08.030\nAnd what it doesn't like about it is that\n\n54\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.420\nit has a mechanism that's involved\nat the router level up here, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.330\nThat says, look,\nto prevent routing loops, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.430\nWhat will I will do is I will go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.390\nimplement this idea that\nI will not allow for\n\n58\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.990\ndata that comes in one interface\nto go back out the same interface.\n\n59\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.418\nNow, in our LAN switching episodes,\nwe already talked about this.\n\n60\n00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:37.884\nThat as we send data into one port,\nit will forward it out to every\n\n61\n00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:42.790\nother port on the switch except for\nthe one it comes in on.\n\n62\n00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.050\nRouters will not actually allow for\nus to send data in and\n\n63\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.090\nsend it back out that same port to do so.\n\n64\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.997\nSo what we have to do is we have\nto actually trick the router by\n\n65\n00:03:56.997 --> 00:04:02.603\nconfiguring it to handle well,\nmore than one VLAN traffic, okay?\n\n66\n00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:07.370\nSo we'll have to actually come up with a\nconfiguration to help us to do that, okay?\n\n67\n00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.110\nAnd that is what we call creating\nsub interfaces on the router, and\n\n68\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.580\nwe'll show you how to do that in our lab.\n\n69\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.960\nThe other thing that has to be done of\ncourse is on the switch itself too, okay?\n\n70\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.220\nSo let me get rid of this drawing cuz\nit's kinda defeating my purpose of what\n\n71\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.760\nI needed, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Also on the link then,\n\n73\n00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.300\nit has to be able to handle, well,\ntraffic from more than one VLAN.\n\n74\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.140\nSo inside of our LAN switching episodes,\nwe said for\n\n75\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.220\nus to be able to send traffic across,\nwell,\n\n76\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.240\na single link from multiple VLANs,\nwe have to configure this interface,\n\n77\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.330\nGigabit 0/1 as an example,\nas being a trunk interface as well.\n\n78\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.124\nSo in doing what we call the idea of\ninter-VLAN routing with a router,\n\n79\n00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:55.610\nwe have to configure this switch\nport over here to be a trunk port.\n\n80\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.285\nThen on the router, we've got to\nconfigure that interface over here\n\n81\n00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:09.250\nto essentially be logically sub-divided up\nto handle a VLAN for each one of these.\n\n82\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.250\nSo essentially turning this link\ninto three virtual links for\n\n83\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.830\nus on one link here.\n\n84\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.380\nThe only limitation that you and I have\nas far as the physical configuration goes\n\n85\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.310\nis you cannot use a 10 megabit\nconnection to this trunk, okay?\n\n86\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.170\nIt's gonna require at least a fast\nEthernet connection, or 100 megabit, or\n\n87\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.580\na gigabit connection to do so.\n\n88\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.460\nSo do not try this with a slower link.\n\n89\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.810\nIt must be up here, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.340\nWe must have either 100 megabit or we\nhave to have a gigabit connection, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.570\nSo that's kind of the key in what\nwe're doing when we start doing this.\n\n92\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.680\nThe other thing that we're gonna talk\nabout a little bit later on is when we\n\n93\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.280\ndon't actually have a router\nany more to deal with and\n\n94\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.722\nwe only have a layer 3 switch.\n\n95\n00:05:56.722 --> 00:06:00.477\nWell, how do we configure inter-VLAN\nrouting with a layer 3 switch?\n\n96\n00:06:00.477 --> 00:06:02.700\nAnd we'll get to that one as well.\n\n97\n00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.010\nThis particular topology that we're doing\n\n98\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.060\nright now is also regularly\nknown as router on a stick.\n\n99\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.097\nAnd you can see why.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:12.550\n&gt;&gt; It looks like a lollipop.\n\n101\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.976\nIt does, it looks like a-\n&gt;&gt; It's great name.\n\n102\n00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:15.753\n&gt;&gt; It's actually right on a stick, and\n\n103\n00:06:15.753 --> 00:06:18.980\nthat's why they call this\nconfiguration router on a stick.\n\n104\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.130\nSo remember that there's two\nsides to this configuration.\n\n105\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.920\nAnd the one that you're gonna pay\nattention to most is gonna be\n\n106\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.860\nright up here on the router configuration.\n\n107\n00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.030\nConfiguring this as being a trunk isn't\nthe hardest thing in the world to do, but\n\n108\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.200\nwe are gonna limit it to the VLANs\nthat we want going across it, and\n\n109\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.150\nnot just opening up to every\nsingle VLAN that we can find out.\n\n110\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.270\nBut overall though, you'll see its\nconfiguration is relatively simple, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.780\nSo let's go ahead and do that so that we\ncan see what's gonna be happening, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.225\nSo here, we're gonna be using this\nlab right here called Configure,\n\n113\n00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:58.065\nVerify, and\nTroubleshoot Inter-VLAN Routing, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:01.155\nSo that is the lab that we'll\nbe using to help us to set\n\n115\n00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:02.085\nthis up.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n116\n00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:03.385\n&gt;&gt; They pre-configure\n\n117\n00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:05.375\nthis in a couple of different ways.\n\n118\n00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:09.410\nSo what we have on the switch\nthat we'll be using, okay,\n\n119\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.051\nalready on NYCORE1,\nis gonna be three different VLANs, okay?\n\n120\n00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:17.115\nThey've already configured VLAN 16,\n17, and 18,\n\n121\n00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:20.500\nthey've already been\nconfigured in the setup.\n\n122\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.140\nBecause of the way that the switches\nwork in this basic diagram here, so\n\n123\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.810\nlet me see if I can pull\nup the basic diagram and\n\n124\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.520\nI'll kinda take a look at\nit a little bit more here.\n\n125\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.350\nSo in this diagram, because there's\nactually two switches in between here and\n\n126\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.370\nwhat we're configuring is really just\nright here in-between this router and\n\n127\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.250\nthis switch.\n\n128\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.119\nThey've gone ahead and they've configured\na trunk link in-between NYCORE1 and\n\n129\n00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:47.390\nNYACCESS1.\n\n130\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.630\nSo it actually does act does one switch,\nso\n\n131\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.128\nyou don't have to worry about\nthat configuration as well, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:53.128 --> 00:07:57.184\nAlso, the P lab CSO1,\nwhatever this one is,\n\n133\n00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:01.041\nis also been configured\nwith an IP address.\n\n134\n00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.399\nAnd NYACCESS1 has been\nconfigured with IP address,\n\n135\n00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:07.541\nthey're gonna be in two different VLANs,\nokay?\n\n136\n00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:10.733\nSo those IP addresses are gonna be\nin different VLANs is what we'll\n\n137\n00:08:10.733 --> 00:08:11.790\nend up seeing there.\n\n138\n00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.610\nAll right, so now that we've got that\nsettled up here, let's go to NYCORE1 which\n\n139\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.950\nis gonna be the switch that we're going\nto configure for the trunk link, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.260\nSo we're configuring now\nthe trunk between us and\n\n141\n00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.100\nNYEDGE1 which is gonna be our router,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.302\nSo on NYCORE1, go ahead and\nget accessed in, if I can,\n\n143\n00:08:35.302 --> 00:08:41.636\nand get out of the user mode into\nprivileged exec mode, well maybe.\n\n144\n00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:47.583\nLemme try it one more time,\nget there, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:50.990\nConfigure terminal.\n\n146\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.750\nNow, I don't know why it keeps going back.\n\n147\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.936\nLet's see if I can get to NYCORE1 here.\n\n148\n00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:03.690\nIt keeps kicking me like it's not\ngoing to allow me to do that.\n\n149\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.940\nMaybe, let me zoom out.\n\n150\n00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.340\nSometimes that zooming thing\nis not doing what we wanna do.\n\n151\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.060\nSo hopefully I can keep that on the screen\nhere without causing much delay, okay?\n\n152\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:22.252\nSo that interface between NYCORE1 and\nNYEDGE1 is fast ethernet 1/0/1.\n\n153\n00:09:22.252 --> 00:09:25.356\nSo if I go into global configuration mode.\n\n154\n00:09:28.397 --> 00:09:31.571\nIt still kicks me all the way out there.\n\n155\n00:09:48.377 --> 00:09:52.615\nOkay, finally, [LAUGH] I don't know why,\n\n156\n00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:56.867\nI was like, it's still not working here.\n\n157\n00:09:56.867 --> 00:10:01.905\nSo I just give it a moment here and\nso once we get in there,\n\n158\n00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:06.422\nnow I can do interface fastethernet 1/0/1.\n\n159\n00:10:06.422 --> 00:10:13.832\nAnd now, inside of this, we're gonna\nstart configuring it as a trunk port,\n\n160\n00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:20.720\nso this is gonna be switchport\ntrunk encapsulation dot1q, okay?\n\n161\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.050\nThat is the method of encapsulation or\ntagging that we're gonna put onto\n\n162\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.010\nthis trunk port here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n163\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Then we're going to limit\n\n164\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.240\nthe VLANs that we're gonna\nallow on this trunk port.\n\n165\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.490\nThe switchport trunk allowed VLANs,\n\n166\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:42.160\nwe're gonna get rid of any\nprevious notion of allowing\n\n167\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.948\neverything to go across,\nthat should be VLAN, sorry.\n\n168\n00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:52.505\nSwitchport trunk allowed vlan,\n\n169\n00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:57.800\nthat should be none, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.066\nSo, allowed VLAN, none.\n\n171\n00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:02.450\nAnd now we'll configure\nonly the ones that we want.\n\n172\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.446\nSwitchport trunk\n\n173\n00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:12.442\nallowed vlans add\n\n174\n00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:18.442\n16,17,18.\n\n175\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.060\nI have to spell switchport correctly.\n\n176\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.443\nI tell you, my typing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:26.620\n&gt;&gt; It is terrible.\n\n178\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:34.022\n16, 17, 18, all right.\n\n179\n00:11:34.022 --> 00:11:39.826\nNow we have to actually issue\nthe command to turn this into the trunk,\n\n180\n00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:41.840\nthe mode, okay?\n\n181\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.711\nNow if you try to do the mode\ntrunk first it's not gonna work,\n\n182\n00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:47.471\nit's gonna tell you you're\nmissing the encapsulation,\n\n183\n00:11:47.471 --> 00:11:50.800\nso that's why we did it in\nthis particular order, okay?\n\n184\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:58.010\nSo now that we've got that set up,\ndo show interface trunk.\n\n185\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.960\nLet's verify a couple of things, okay?\n\n186\n00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.390\nSo, here it is.\n\n187\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.590\nOn our trunking port here,\nthat we have available\n\n188\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.750\nto us, we are seeing,\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n189\n00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.620\nSo, All right,\n\n190\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.167\nI was looking at these numbers,\nI was like, why is this doing that?\n\n191\n00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:27.441\nBut they have switched this at\nsome point here to Fa0/24 and\n\n192\n00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:30.825\nwe're seeing that it's configured for\n\n193\n00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:35.623\nthis even though the interface is Fa1/0/1,\nokay?\n\n194\n00:12:35.623 --> 00:12:38.998\nSo we're gonna just go with it cuz\nit actually is working right now.\n\n195\n00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:42.856\nSo somehow there's reporting\nfrom the other side,\n\n196\n00:12:42.856 --> 00:12:47.248\nwhich is unusual, but\nthat's what we're seeing, okay?\n\n197\n00:12:47.248 --> 00:12:51.253\nSo Fa1/0/24,\nnotice that is only allowing those and\n\n198\n00:12:51.253 --> 00:12:55.897\nalso of course right here, okay,\nit is actually allowing just 1 and\n\n199\n00:12:55.897 --> 00:12:59.921\n16 through 18 and\nthe same thing here on spanning tree.\n\n200\n00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:03.622\nSo we're gonna leave that as is\ncuz I'm not exactly sure but\n\n201\n00:13:03.622 --> 00:13:07.918\nthey've changed it around on\nthe other end, is what's happening,\n\n202\n00:13:07.918 --> 00:13:10.154\nis the only thing I can see going on.\n\n203\n00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:14.321\nSo, even though I actually did configure\nfor one interface it turned it on for\n\n204\n00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:14.907\nthis one.\n\n205\n00:13:14.907 --> 00:13:18.628\nSo there's some magic happening in\nthe background that we're seeing, which is\n\n206\n00:13:18.628 --> 00:13:22.870\nunusual, but that's what we're gonna go\nwith cuz that's how they have it set up.\n\n207\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.630\nSo now that we've got that set up and\nwe know that we've now limited this,\n\n208\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.050\nthe trunk is now set up,\n\n209\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.380\nwe do not have to worry about\nconfiguring the rest of the switch.\n\n210\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.820\nThe switch already has VLANs,\n\n211\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.395\nit already has interfaces in those VLANs.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n212\n00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:36.537\n&gt;&gt; So we've already done that in\n\n213\n00:13:36.537 --> 00:13:37.450\na previous episode, so\n\n214\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.810\nwe're not gonna worry about it too much.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n215\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.784\n&gt;&gt; Now if we go to NYEDGE1, though, Okay,\n\n216\n00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:49.800\non NYEDGE1, this is the one that's\ngonna be a little bit trickier, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.850\nSo once you have the trunk configured\nin the way that you want to, now, we\n\n218\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:14:00.550\nhave to go in and we have to actually be\nable to create sub-interfaces on NYEDGE1.\n\n219\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.311\nLet's get into our privilege mode and\n\n220\n00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:05.977\nwe're going out into a global\nconfiguration mode as well.\n\n221\n00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:12.810\nOkay, now inside of our global\nconfiguration mode, okay?\n\n222\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.780\nRemember that because of the way that this\nis gonna work, where we literally sending\n\n223\n00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.470\ntraffic into that same port and then\ncoming out of that exact same port here.\n\n224\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.840\nWe've got to convince the router\nthat that's not going to be true.\n\n225\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.976\nThe way that we do this is by\ncreating what we call sub-interfaces.\n\n226\n00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:35.190\nSub-interfaces are not\nreal physical interfaces.\n\n227\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.110\nThey allow us to take\none physical port and\n\n228\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.330\ntreat it as if it's multiple ports, okay?\n\n229\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.740\nThat's what it does.\n\n230\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.640\nBut it creates it logically so\nthat the router believes they're actually\n\n231\n00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.600\ndifferent ports,\neven though it's the same port.\n\n232\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.870\nSo if you don't do this right you'll\nactually have what we call split horizon.\n\n233\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.450\nIt actually will stop that\ntraffic from coming back out,\n\n234\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.410\ntrying to get to the VLAN\nthat it needs to go.\n\n235\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.050\nBut now that a trunk can handle and\n\n236\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.720\nsend multiple VLANs along this trunk here,\nnow on the router side,\n\n237\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:13.040\nwe have to actually be able to allow for\nthe router to accept that as well, okay?\n\n238\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.900\nSo here is what we\nare going to begin doing.\n\n239\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.730\nSo at the very beginning, you can do\nthis in a couple of different ways.\n\n240\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.150\nLet me see if I can now zoom back in\njust a little bit to help us out.\n\n241\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.670\nWell, okay.\n\n242\n00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:33.614\nSo we begin by doing an interface and\nthen gigabit,\n\n243\n00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:39.795\nEthernet, and\nthe interface that we're gonna actually\n\n244\n00:15:39.795 --> 00:15:44.390\ndivide up is gonna be\nthe 0/0 interface here, okay?\n\n245\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.624\nNow everybody does this differently, but\n\n246\n00:15:46.624 --> 00:15:50.047\nthe way that you do this is by\nputting a dot after that second zero.\n\n247\n00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:55.069\nAnd now you can choose any number\nyou want, usually between 0,\n\n248\n00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:59.350\nactually 1, excuse me, 1 and about 65,535.\n\n249\n00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.900\nNow, technically though, you don't ever\nwanna go that high because now you're\n\n250\n00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.376\nreally just chopping it up to\na place you don't wanna go.\n\n251\n00:16:05.376 --> 00:16:08.231\nBut right now though, for\nus, you can do that but\n\n252\n00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:11.280\nyou can choose any\nnumber that you want to.\n\n253\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.941\nI normally like to put it as being the\nsame number as the VLAN that I'm creating\n\n254\n00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:16.883\nit for, okay?\n\n255\n00:16:16.883 --> 00:16:22.330\nSo I'm gonna do this .0.16, all right?\n\n256\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.812\nSo we're gonna create that and\nnow notice the prompt where it says,\n\n257\n00:16:25.812 --> 00:16:30.390\nconfig-subif which means sub\ninterface configuration.\n\n258\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.790\nSo we've got that going on.\n\n259\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.977\nAnd now once I've got that,\nI can now do an encapsulation.\n\n260\n00:16:44.154 --> 00:16:45.447\nAnd let's do a question mark so\n\n261\n00:16:45.447 --> 00:16:48.540\nthat we can see some of the other\nthings that we can do, okay?\n\n262\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:54.030\nWell, because of this particular NYEDGE1,\nthis is actually a layer 3 switch for\n\n263\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.720\nus that's acting as\na router at the same time,\n\n264\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.160\nthat's what we're doing here instead.\n\n265\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.070\nIt really only has dot1q for us.\n\n266\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:08.150\nNow, on older devices as well and\ndepending on the iOS that you're running,\n\n267\n00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.820\nyou might see of course not only dot1q,\nbut one called ISL or ISIL.\n\n268\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.200\nMost people don't use ISL anymore.\n\n269\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.370\nBut you will see sometimes.\n\n270\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.960\nYou actually see the other\noption there too.\n\n271\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.530\nWe're not going to worry about\nthe priority tag for right now.\n\n272\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.290\nSo let's leave that one alone.\n\n273\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.720\nAnd we'll just do encapsulation dot1q.\n\n274\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.340\nNow, we are not done yet, okay?\n\n275\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.240\nSo make sure you realize that there\nis another command for us to go.\n\n276\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.000\nYou have to put in the right VLAN ID.\n\n277\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.525\nAnd this is gonna be important.\n\n278\n00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:42.850\nBecause if you don't,\nthis is actually not going to work for us.\n\n279\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.900\nSo it's going to be encapsulation dot1q,\n\n280\n00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.920\nand then the VLAN ID for what we're gonna\nbe doing is gonna be 16, all right?\n\n281\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.330\nNow I can type in an IP address.\n\n282\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.290\nYou cannot put in an IP address\nbefore the encapsulation.\n\n283\n00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.530\nIt will complain, but\nlet's go ahead and do this one.\n\n284\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:08.342\nThis is gonna be 192.168.16.1.\n\n285\n00:18:08.342 --> 00:18:13.310\nAnd 24 bit subnet mask,\nperfectly fine, okay?\n\n286\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.131\nNow let's do it the way that I\nkind of think about doing it and\n\n287\n00:18:16.131 --> 00:18:19.752\nwe'll show you some of the warnings\nthat you'll end up getting as you do it.\n\n288\n00:18:19.752 --> 00:18:24.360\nSo we're gonna do interface\n\n289\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.970\ngb/0.17 here, okay?\n\n290\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.430\nAnd now that I've created that,\nlet me go ahead and try and\n\n291\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:38.178\ntype in an IP address,\n192.168.17, oop, 17.\n\n292\n00:18:38.178 --> 00:18:40.149\n17, why can't I do a 17?\n\n293\n00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:46.051\n17.1, And\nnow notice it gives you this error.\n\n294\n00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:48.223\nIt's like look you're\ncreating a sub interface,\n\n295\n00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:50.510\nwe know you're trying to do trunking here.\n\n296\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.496\nSo we know you're trying to actually\ndo this inter-VLAN routing and\n\n297\n00:18:53.496 --> 00:18:56.079\nit's saying look,\nit's not actually gonna work for you.\n\n298\n00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:59.736\nConfiguring an IP routing on a LAN sub\ninterface is only allowed if you already\n\n299\n00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:01.190\nhave this configured.\n\n300\n00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.470\nSo it's saying look, go ahead and\nput in the encapsulation first.\n\n301\n00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.605\nEncapsulation dot1q, and then for VLAN 17.\n\n302\n00:19:10.605 --> 00:19:13.120\nAnd now as I type in the address,\n\n303\n00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.360\nNotice it doesn't complain anymore.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.500\n&gt;&gt; So if you get them out of order,\n\n305\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.360\nit will complain,\nit doesn't mean the end of the world.\n\n306\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.580\nIt just means it's saying you've gotta\ndo this in this certain order if\n\n307\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.740\nyou do so, okay?\n\n308\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:34.161\nAnd one more interface for us here and\nthis is gonna be gigabit 0/0.18.\n\n309\n00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:38.640\nSo now I'm using just the abbreviations\nand notice that I take it very easily\n\n310\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:45.300\nhere, and then I can do encap\ndot1q then 18, so it takes it.\n\n311\n00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.370\nRemember it just has to be unambiguous.\n\n312\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.430\nYou can use abbreviations.\n\n313\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.290\nEven on the exam you\ncan use abbreviations.\n\n314\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.880\nBut the only way that you actually know,\n\n315\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.150\nright, is if you type in an abbreviation\nand then hit the Tab key.\n\n316\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.790\nAnd it doesn't fill out the rest\nof it on a normal switch.\n\n317\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.832\nOn this interface it's not gonna work for\nus.\n\n318\n00:20:03.832 --> 00:20:06.943\nWhen on a normal switch or router it\nshould fill out the rest of the command\n\n319\n00:20:06.943 --> 00:20:10.700\nfor you, if it doesn't take it,\nit means it is expecting the full command.\n\n320\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.150\nSo there is no way for me to tell you\nwhich questions are gonna have, or\n\n321\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.780\nyou gonna be able to do abbreviations or\nnot.\n\n322\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.897\nMy recommendation right now is type\nout the full thing as much as you can,\n\n323\n00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:24.676\ncuz that will at least gets you to\nknow what the right syntax is, and\n\n324\n00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:27.462\nthen you can abbreviate it if you need to,\nokay?\n\n325\n00:20:27.462 --> 00:20:33.951\nSo then, IP address, 92.168.18.1 and\n\n326\n00:20:33.951 --> 00:20:37.790\n24 bit subnet mask, again.\n\n327\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.850\nAnd once we've got all of that done, okay?\n\n328\n00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.860\nThere's one more configuration\nthat you and I have to do.\n\n329\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.620\nNow, you can technically say two more\nconfigurations if you choose to, but for\n\n330\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.370\nus it's really one more.\n\n331\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.870\nThis is actually gonna\nbe what subinterfaces\n\n332\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.252\nof the physical interface\nof gigabit ethernet 0/0.\n\n333\n00:20:58.252 --> 00:21:05.509\nCurrently, though, do show ip int brief.\n\n334\n00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:10.742\nNotice that 0/0 though,\n\n335\n00:21:10.742 --> 00:21:16.060\nokay, is set to administratively down,\nokay?\n\n336\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.269\nAnd that means that all of\nthe sub-interfaces are also\n\n337\n00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:23.390\nadministratively down as well, okay?\n\n338\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.350\nBut there's two options here.\n\n339\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.860\nI can go back into each sub-interface and\nturn them on but\n\n340\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.580\nthe easier option is to\nactually go to int g0/0 and\n\n341\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.140\nthen just do a no shutdown command.\n\n342\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.760\nAnd in a moment here we should\nsee some different configurations\n\n343\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.920\nstarting to come up there.\n\n344\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.060\nSo there is one.\n\n345\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.130\nSo now we've actually changed\nthe physical state there.\n\n346\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:55.597\nNow, do show ip int brief.\n\n347\n00:21:57.137 --> 00:22:00.400\nOkay, now notice the difference here,\nokay?\n\n348\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.190\nEverything has now been turned back on and\nthose sub-interfaces are now up and\n\n349\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.450\nready to go.\n\n350\n00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.770\nYou do not have to assign and\n\n351\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.640\nyou normally do not assign an IP\naddress to the physical interface that\n\n352\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.470\nyou are creating the sub-interfaces\non as well, okay?\n\n353\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.160\nSo you don't have to do that.\n\n354\n00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.890\nThe other thing that I normally\ndo is I always go ahead and\n\n355\n00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:29.080\nI create another sub-interface for\nthe native VLAN, which is VLAN1.\n\n356\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.020\nSo that that's gonna be where\nmy manager traffic is gonna go.\n\n357\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.520\nBut you don't have to do that at all.\n\n358\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.780\nIf you choose not to it's\nnot gonna hurt anything.\n\n359\n00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.150\nFor us, we're not going to do this\nbecause it's not what we're actually\n\n360\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.570\nsetting up to do right now.\n\n361\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.180\nAll right, so now that we've gotten\neverything let's test it out,\n\n362\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.170\nwe want to verify that\nwe have a connection to\n\n363\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.870\nthese that we have on this VLAN, okay?\n\n364\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:57.927\nSo there's a device out there which\nis going to be 192.168.17.10.\n\n365\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:06.332\nA ping, 192.168.17.10\n\n366\n00:23:11.611 --> 00:23:15.670\nOkay, notice that it did\nactually become successful.\n\n367\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.320\nUsually the first ping is about\ndoing the idea of getting up and\n\n368\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.910\ngetting everything set up,\nsometimes it's a little bit slow but\n\n369\n00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.420\nit did end up becoming\nsuccessful here at the very end.\n\n370\n00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.204\nBecause everything is actually the way\nthat we've actually set it up which\n\n371\n00:23:30.204 --> 00:23:32.617\nis perfectly fine for\nwhat we want to do, okay?\n\n372\n00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:35.312\nNow the other side of this,\nI have to go and\n\n373\n00:23:35.312 --> 00:23:39.316\nturn on this device here which\nmight take a few moments here But\n\n374\n00:23:39.316 --> 00:23:43.440\nit actually will allow us just\na little bit of time right?\n\n375\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.270\nSo now what we actually know is that\nwe can go out of this interface,\n\n376\n00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:53.989\nwhich is 17.1, and\nwe can now hit that 17.10 device.\n\n377\n00:23:53.989 --> 00:23:58.230\nAnd if I'm correct that's\nactually NYACCESS1 here.\n\n378\n00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.700\nLet me verify and\nsee if I can show that as well.\n\n379\n00:24:05.946 --> 00:24:06.773\nOops!\n\n380\n00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.188\n[LAUGH] Sometimes this lab,\n\n381\n00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:13.990\nI was like, maybe not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It had to\n\n382\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.149\ntake a pause.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n383\n00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:24.120\nGive it a moment, yep.\n\n384\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.580\nSo you can see that right\nhere on this device,\n\n385\n00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:33.060\nthey created Vlan17 and\nthere's the IP address we just pinged.\n\n386\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.950\nSo from NYEDGE1, okay, where we were,\nwhich is essentially our router,\n\n387\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:45.790\nit was able to ping NYACCESS1, which\nis the second switch down that we saw.\n\n388\n00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.150\nSo it is able to ping\nthrough to that one VLAN.\n\n389\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.169\nNow here comes that PLAB and\nthis is gonna be on that Vlan16,\n\n390\n00:24:55.169 --> 00:24:58.170\nis what I believe is going to be here.\n\n391\n00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:05.731\nAnd I've gotta zoom out here for a moment\nbecause this one does not allow me to,\n\n392\n00:25:08.581 --> 00:25:14.410\nOkay, so this one should be on the 16,\nso now that device is up.\n\n393\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.891\nSee if I can do this as well,\nlet's go back to NYEDGE1,\n\n394\n00:25:23.558 --> 00:25:27.890\n192.168.16.10.\n\n395\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.480\nAnd notice that that one is also good.\n\n396\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.040\nSo our router's actually working\nwhere I can ping from the router to\n\n397\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.240\neach of the different Vlans\nthat are actually available.\n\n398\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:45.273\nNow from P, from that PC1, though, see\nif I can find that device again as well.\n\n399\n00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:55.950\nWe want to verify that the connection's\nactually good even from this side.\n\n400\n00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.745\nSo let's change up just a couple of things\nso that we can see it a little bit better.\n\n401\n00:26:09.904 --> 00:26:13.449\nAnd remember that when we begin pinging,\nwe wanna make sure, of course,\n\n402\n00:26:13.449 --> 00:26:14.960\nthat we can ping out.\n\n403\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.433\nSo from me all the way\nout the default gateway,\n\n404\n00:26:17.433 --> 00:26:19.915\nwhich is the one we just configured,\nis fine.\n\n405\n00:26:19.915 --> 00:26:27.712\nNow I can ping 192.168.17.1.\n\n406\n00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:30.588\nAnd notice that that allows me to\ngo all the way up to the router and\n\n407\n00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:33.748\nI can ping the other router interface\non the other subinterface here.\n\n408\n00:26:37.076 --> 00:26:44.588\nAnd then if I ping 192.168.17,\nwhat was it 11, no 10.\n\n409\n00:26:44.588 --> 00:26:48.985\nOkay, I just wanna make sure, 17.10.\n\n410\n00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:54.108\nThat now allows me to also ping\nthat switch, which means it went\n\n411\n00:26:54.108 --> 00:26:59.232\nfrom my PC through NYACCESS1\nall the way up through NYCORE1,\n\n412\n00:26:59.232 --> 00:27:06.350\nhit NYEDGE1, comes back down again\nthrough that 17, that .17 interface.\n\n413\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.481\nAnd then all the way back\ndown to NYACCESS1, to ping.\n\n414\n00:27:09.481 --> 00:27:12.330\nAnd that is because\nthey're on separate VLANS.\n\n415\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:17.160\nWithout the router on the stick\nconfiguration, it cannot be done.\n\n416\n00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.930\nSo that's why, when you have two different\nVLANS and you need to be able to send data\n\n417\n00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:26.460\nbetween both of them, you have to\nhave at least that configuration.\n\n418\n00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.780\nIf you have a router on hand to do so,\nthis is the way you allow for\n\n419\n00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.390\nthat to happen.\n\n420\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.150\nNow the only other thing that\nI didn't put in here, okay,\n\n421\n00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:41.270\nis notice that the connection to the\nInternet is also out here as well, okay?\n\n422\n00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.240\nNow I don't really have\na connection to the Internet, but\n\n423\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.820\nit's here on the router, right?\n\n424\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.900\nThat what I can do is I now can set up\nfrom what you and I learned about in our\n\n425\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.940\nconfiguration, right, of different routes,\ncuz I can create a default\n\n426\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:02.300\non that router to say, hey, just send\nit out to another router out here.\n\n427\n00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.270\nAnd that means it is not actually\ngoing to any of these other VLANs that\n\n428\n00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.420\nare out here.\n\n429\n00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.460\nGo ahead and send it out to this\ninterface out to the Internet, okay.\n\n430\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.460\nSo we can even set all that up\nif we actually chose to, okay?\n\n431\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.390\nSo Zach, at this point we've configured\nrouter on the stick configuration\n\n432\n00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:23.390\nby showing the configuration of that trunk\nport on the switch that we're using,\n\n433\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.170\nas well as creating those subinterfaces.\n\n434\n00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:31.719\nRemember that encapsulation .1Q and\nthen whatever the VLAN ID is, okay.\n\n435\n00:28:31.719 --> 00:28:34.199\nAnd then don't forget to\nturn on the interface,\n\n436\n00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:36.386\nthe physical interface at the end of that.\n\n437\n00:28:36.386 --> 00:28:40.410\nCuz if you forget to turn that on it's\ngonna actually not work for you as well.\n\n438\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:44.390\nSo those are some of the little things\nthat you have to pay attention to.\n\n439\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.860\nBut Zach, we're not completely\ndone with inner VLAN routing yet\n\n440\n00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.050\nbecause we also need\nto take a look at this\n\n441\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.950\nfrom the standpoint of actually\nusing a layer 3 switch to do this.\n\n442\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.120\nAnd the great thing is, it's actually\nan easier configuration but we'll\n\n443\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.990\nbe configuring what we call, well, an SVI\nwhich is a switch virtual interface that\n\n444\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.600\nwill help us to do this all within a layer\nthree switch without needing a router.\n\n445\n00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.478\nNow we're gonna have to save that for\n\n446\n00:29:08.478 --> 00:29:13.410\na part two on this particular lab\ninstead cuz I've run out of time\n\n447\n00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.693\nby talking about router on a stick.\n&gt;&gt; Configure inter-VLAN routing with\n\n448\n00:29:17.693 --> 00:29:18.801\nrouting on a stick.\n\n449\n00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:21.920\nAnd there'll be more\nconfiguring inter-VLAN routing.\n\n450\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.920\nAnd that will be in part two.\n\n451\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.150\nMake sure you see that.\n\n452\n00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.600\nAnd before we move on, Ronnie,\n\n453\n00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.190\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Not really, so\n\n454\n00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.715\nthis part of the configuration, and\nthe only other thing I should say,\n\n455\n00:29:31.715 --> 00:29:37.120\nright, in all reality, you probably will\nnot see this configuration in a real\n\n456\n00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.040\nproduction setting, okay?\n\n457\n00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.190\nThis is great in a lab setting.\n\n458\n00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:46.140\nAnd at one time you had to, but today\nyou don't tend to see anything like this\n\n459\n00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.783\nnecessary because yeah, it's just not as\nnecessary any more with layer 3 switches.\n\n460\n00:29:51.783 --> 00:29:57.215\nWhat we're about to do, though, in layer 3\nswitches you'll see that much more often.\n\n461\n00:29:57.215 --> 00:30:00.360\nThat's the one you also wanna pay\nattention to as well, but they will be\n\n462\n00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.944\ntested both on the exam, so be aware.\n&gt;&gt; Important stuff, thanks again, Ronnie.\n\n463\n00:30:04.944 --> 00:30:07.758\nAnd see everything inside\nof the Cisco CCENT series.\n\n464\n00:30:07.758 --> 00:30:09.340\nSee every episode.\n\n465\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.380\nRonnie's done a great job putting all\nthis information together for you.\n\n466\n00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.220\nAnd you'll be in the course library, too.\n\n467\n00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.754\nThere's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n468\n00:30:17.754 --> 00:30:18.877\nhelp you go further.\n\n469\n00:30:18.877 --> 00:30:21.324\nNow tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n470\n00:30:21.324 --> 00:30:23.270\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n471\n00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.640\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n472\n00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.878\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n473\n00:30:26.878 --> 00:30:34.231\n[MUSIC]\n\n474\n00:30:34.231 --> 00:30:36.796\nThank you for watching

00:00:06.758\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:08.675\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:13.437\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:16.970\nwatching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.100\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue with Cisco CCENT.\n\n8\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.384\nThis is gonna be configuring\ninterVLAN routing, part two.\n\n9\n00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:27.167\nMake sure you see part one, important.\n\n10\n00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:31.330\nAnd the person bringing us the information\nwe need, is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.000\nRonnie, good to see you again, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me on the show,\n\n12\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.750\nZach, as we continue on with\nour CCENT journey together.\n\n13\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.918\nWe are now again in, as Zach said,\na part two of interVLAN routing.\n\n14\n00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:45.460\nWe've already configured\nrouter on a stick, so\n\n15\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.242\nthat you know that when you actually\ndo have multiple VLANs on a switch and\n\n16\n00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:53.272\nyou need to do routing in between them,\nyou're gonna need a layer 3 device,\n\n17\n00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:55.930\nwhich is normally gonna be a router.\n\n18\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.920\nRouters today, though, we don't tend to\ndo a lot of interVLAN routing on that\n\n19\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.283\nconfiguration that we\ncall router on a stick.\n\n20\n00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:06.876\nMost of it has kind of gone away\nbecause we've introduced a newer\n\n21\n00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:10.220\ndevice that we call a layer 3 switch.\n\n22\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.628\nNow a layer 3 switch has both of\nthe abilities of a layer 2 switch,\n\n23\n00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:18.662\nas well as some of the routing\ncomponents on a router, okay.\n\n24\n00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.450\nSo it doesn't do a full router's job.\n\n25\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.669\nSome of it can do some of it, but\nis not really designed to be full router.\n\n26\n00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.400\nBut at the same time, though,\n\n27\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.410\nit can handle most of the basic\nfunctions that routers can do.\n\n28\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.150\nSo it gives us this chance,\ninstead of needing a third device or\n\n29\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.130\nanother device like an external device\nto handle that traffic in between VLANs.\n\n30\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.260\nIt says it can do it internally.\n\n31\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.210\nBut you and I have to actually be able\nto understand how to set that up and\n\n32\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.790\nmake it work.\n\n33\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.250\nBecause if there's a configuration to\ndo this, that's actually more common,\n\n34\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.750\nit's gonna be this one instead of\nthe idea of the router on a stick.\n\n35\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.700\nSo when we start to do\nsomething like this,\n\n36\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.760\nthere's gonna be something that we\ncan't do yet which is unusual, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.670\nSo let me see if I can bring up the,\nwhere did the lab go?\n\n38\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.770\nThere I go, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770\nI bring up the lab here for\na moment to help us out.\n\n40\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.738\nAnd that is starting to look\na little bit diminutive here.\n\n41\n00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:14.593\nOnce again,\n\n42\n00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:17.584\nlet me put this back up here for a moment.\n&gt;&gt; There you\n\n43\n00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:20.144\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now I can actually kind of\n\n44\n00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:23.922\ndo a couple things here just so\nthat we can see this, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:28.111\nSo on NYCORE1 here, let's just do a show,\n\n46\n00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:35.140\nenter show ip interface brief,\ncuz I just need to check something out.\n\n47\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.159\nDo show ip interface brief.\n\n48\n00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:47.302\nSo notice all of the ports that are on\nhere that we have available to us.\n\n49\n00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:51.333\nAnd even though you see where it says\nIP Address assigned, let's take for\n\n50\n00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.057\nan example.\n\n51\n00:02:52.057 --> 00:02:54.762\nI'm just trying to pull one that I know\nI'm not gonna mess something up on here.\n\n52\n00:02:54.762 --> 00:02:59.650\nSo let's just do like, FA1/0/9 here, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.100\nSo if I wanted to configure that interface\nwith an IP address, let's do this.\n\n54\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.204\nWe'll kinda go interface,\nfa for FastEthernet, 1/0/9.\n\n55\n00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:21.853\nUsually we would just type in ip address,\nand then we'll do 192.168.9.1,\n\n56\n00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:27.105\njust as an example,\n24 bit subnet mask, and I press Enter.\n\n57\n00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:31.046\nAnd now notice it says hey,\nI can't do this.\n\n58\n00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:35.265\nI'm not allowing you to put\nan IP address on an interface.\n\n59\n00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.895\nSo that now kind of, you're like, well, so\n\n60\n00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:43.650\nhow do we do interVLAN routing if each\nVLAN is its own broadcast domain?\n\n61\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.810\nI need to set up a default gateway, but\nI can't do it on one of those interfaces.\n\n62\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.380\nSo how does this end up working for us?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.924\n&gt;&gt; Well, we have to actually create what\n\n64\n00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:57.500\nwe call an SVI,\na Switched Virtual Interface.\n\n65\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.920\nNow this is the same as us doing, like\nwhen we took a look at router on a stick,\n\n66\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.600\ndoing the subinterfaces up on the router\non that one physical interface.\n\n67\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.650\nBut inside of the switch we're\nactually going to be subdividing, or\n\n68\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.320\ncreating that switch virtual interface\nby using VLANs is what we're gonna do,\n\n69\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.730\ninterface VLANs is what\nwe're gonna do here.\n\n70\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.930\nAnd on those, we can go ahead and\nalso assign IP addresses to them.\n\n71\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.020\nBut there has to be a key command for\nus to do so.\n\n72\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.720\nNow before we do this, I went ahead and\n\n73\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.782\ntyped in kind of the basic configuration\nof what it is that we're going to because\n\n74\n00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:38.030\nit's not as much as when we\ndid the router on stick, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.080\nSo on that layer 3 switch, and\nours is 3750 is what we have available.\n\n76\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.734\nLet's say we want to set up\nthese three different VLANs,\n\n77\n00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:47.959\nwe already know how to\nconfigure VLANs on them.\n\n78\n00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:50.286\nWe know how to assign\ninterfaces to those VLANs,\n\n79\n00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:54.350\nso I'm not gonna worry about that\ncuz you already know how to do that.\n\n80\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.280\nThen there has to also of\ncourse be something that you\n\n81\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.030\ngotta make sure you that you do, okay?\n\n82\n00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.473\nThis is the key, One right here, okay?\n\n83\n00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.410\nYou notice it says IP routing, okay?\n\n84\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.500\nWithout that,\n\n85\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.050\nyou can't assign IP addresses on the\ninterfaces in the way that you want to.\n\n86\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.410\nYou have to be able to turn on IP\nrouting for that switch to do so, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.260\nNow, will it allow you to do\nit on virtual interfaces?\n\n88\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.035\nYes, but in terms of that working as a\nrouter, which is what we need it to do for\n\n89\n00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:31.970\ninterVLAN routing,\nyou have to type in ip routing.\n\n90\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.230\nNow it doesn't matter if it's first or\nif it's last.\n\n91\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.260\nIn our lab configuration, the way that I\nhave it set up, they set it up as last.\n\n92\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.871\nI always type it in first because I\nknow that if I don't, I'll forget it.\n\n93\n00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:44.066\nSo that's what I always do.\n\n94\n00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:47.990\nBut notice that once we do that,\nwe just create our virtual interfaces.\n\n95\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.660\nInterface VLAN 10,\nwe type in an IP address and\n\n96\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.530\nwe make sure that they're turned on.\n\n97\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.650\nNow if you remember, I said that by\ndefault, out of the box when Cisco sends\n\n98\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.770\nus the switch, when we buy a switch,\nright, every interface is on by default.\n\n99\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.030\nThat's every physical\ninterface is on by default.\n\n100\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.790\nVirtual interfaces, though,\nare off by default.\n\n101\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.560\nSo you make sure that you\nenter in a no shutdown command\n\n102\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.500\nafter creating each one of these.\n\n103\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.030\nThe other thing is at the very end here,\nthat I also went ahead and\n\n104\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.710\nput in is this, too.\n\n105\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.870\nI was hoping it was actually\ngonna be the marker here,\n\n106\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.300\nbut apparently I chose the wrong one,\nokay?\n\n107\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.941\nIt's this one right here.\n\n108\n00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:32.202\nOkay, so that one, too,\nis actually gonna be important,\n\n109\n00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:36.090\nwhich is a default gateway or\na default route.\n\n110\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.440\nThis is saying, look, as long as we're\nrouting in between VLANs, that's fine, but\n\n111\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.630\nwhat if I get traffic and\nit's destined for some place else?\n\n112\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.319\nThis is instead telling it\nto route to 0.0.0.0.0.0,\n\n113\n00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.899\nthat's actually gonna be\na default route for us,\n\n114\n00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.498\nthat says send it on to 192.168.1.1.\n\n115\n00:06:55.498 --> 00:07:00.133\nOkay, so we always wanna put that in there\nif we're expecting to route out to another\n\n116\n00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:02.877\nnetwork besides the VLANs\nthat are on the switch,\n\n117\n00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:03.760\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n118\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.590\n&gt;&gt; So that's also\n\n119\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.813\na part of the configuration.\n\n120\n00:07:05.813 --> 00:07:10.670\nSo we're gonna see that when we get\ninto what are configuration is.\n\n121\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.032\nSo now that we are ready,\nwe gonna take NYCORE1, and\n\n122\n00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:18.690\nI've already turned off the router\non the stick configuration here.\n\n123\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.270\nOkay, so to verify that, let me bring up.\n\n124\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.120\nNow let's see,\nwhere is that other device here?\n\n125\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.490\nWhere is that practice device?\n\n126\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.181\nLet me see where it is.\n\n127\n00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.390\nThere it is, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.150\nSo here is that machine that\nwe're actually on here.\n\n129\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.210\nSo let's do acls here, and\nI'm gonna ping 192.168.17.10,\n\n130\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.468\nwhich should be the end\nline access switch.\n\n131\n00:07:42.468 --> 00:07:45.510\nIt's the one that is directly\nconnected to you right now.\n\n132\n00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.640\nBut it is on VLAN 17, okay.\n\n133\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.330\nSo I've turned off that and I simply\nwent up, of course, to the router.\n\n134\n00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.290\nAnd actually, did I go the router or\ndid I go to the switch here?\n\n135\n00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.530\nI went up to the router.\n\n136\n00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.880\nI can't remember which one I did.\n\n137\n00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.035\nI just didn't shut down on that interface.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n138\n00:08:02.035 --> 00:08:03.763\n&gt;&gt; So it's not accepting any traffic.\n\n139\n00:08:03.763 --> 00:08:06.921\nSo that way you know it's not on\nthe router on the stick doing any of\n\n140\n00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.573\nthe interVLAN routing that\nwe're about to do, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:13.193\nSo this device is now showing you\nthat it's not happening that way.\n\n142\n00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:18.120\nSo now on NYCORE1, let's go ahead and\nstart creating then,\n\n143\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.311\nour virtual interfaces that we need to,\nall right?\n\n144\n00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:31.060\nSo the first one is gonna\nbe interface vlan 16, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.050\nAll right,\nyou can pick whatever number you want to.\n\n146\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.878\nFor me, logically, it just makes sense,\nso it's the same thing,\n\n147\n00:08:38.878 --> 00:08:42.366\nokay, ip address 192.168.16.1.\n\n148\n00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:49.444\nAnd these will essentially become,\nThe default\n\n149\n00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:53.520\ngateway for that particular VLAN.\n\n150\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.446\nAnd interface vlan 17, and\nnotice I really don't have to do a lot,\n\n151\n00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:04.695\nI'm just configuring the virtual\ninterface itself, and\n\n152\n00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:09.305\nan IP address on that virtual interface,\nand do a no shutdown.\n\n153\n00:09:14.177 --> 00:09:17.410\nAnd vlan oops, I don't need vlan 10.\n\n154\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.565\nI need interface, do a no,\n\n155\n00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:25.542\ninterface vlan 10, and\n\n156\n00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:30.242\nthen interface vlan 18, and\n\n157\n00:09:30.242 --> 00:09:36.587\nip address 192.168.18.1,\n\n158\n00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:41.658\nAnd a no shutdown.\n\n159\n00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:49.540\nAll right, so believe it or not,\nthat's kind of the major configuration.\n\n160\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.030\nNow that didn't take too long, right?\n\n161\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.820\nWe didn't have to do any\nfancy word encapsulation.\n\n162\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.066\nWe don't have to do all that stuff.\n\n163\n00:09:55.066 --> 00:09:59.002\nThe switch is already able to see that\nwe're using that switched virtual\n\n164\n00:09:59.002 --> 00:10:01.790\ninterface, which is the interface vlans.\n\n165\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.510\nThey're not real,\nthey're virtual interfaces.\n\n166\n00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.600\nI can put an IP address on them,\nI've now turned them on.\n\n167\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.585\nNow when I do something like that,\nright, I told you that there's one\n\n168\n00:10:12.585 --> 00:10:17.064\ncommand that we also have to do\nto make sure that this also done,\n\n169\n00:10:17.064 --> 00:10:20.044\nwhich is going to be from here ip routing.\n\n170\n00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:24.972\nOkay, ip routing will again turn on\nthe routing component inside of this layer\n\n171\n00:10:24.972 --> 00:10:26.610\n3 switch for us.\n\n172\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:33.392\nNow I can type in do show,\nip interface brief,\n\n173\n00:10:33.392 --> 00:10:39.168\nand this is us just verifying that\nwe did all the proper configuration.\n\n174\n00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:42.910\nAnd so here, look at that.\n\n175\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.660\nI messed up at some point here, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.410\nSo that's where you can see it's like,\nmy gosh, he skipped vlan 17.\n\n177\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.600\nYou have the wrong numbers here.\n\n178\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.150\nSo that means that I need to go back and\n\n179\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.730\nI need to add that change in\nthere to essentially help us out.\n\n180\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.027\nBecause it if not,\nit's not gonna work at all.\n\n181\n00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:08.252\nSo now,\nIet me get back into interface vlan 16,\n\n182\n00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:13.069\nand simply type in a new address,\n\n183\n00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:18.931\n16.1, so that should override it.\n\n184\n00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:23.373\nAnd then interface vlan 17, and\n\n185\n00:11:23.373 --> 00:11:29.352\nthen IP address 192.168.17.1.\n\n186\n00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:35.626\nTwo and no shutdown,\n\n187\n00:11:35.626 --> 00:11:40.845\ndo show ip interface brief.\n\n188\n00:11:44.356 --> 00:11:48.044\nAnd in a moment here, let's verify\nthat I have all the proper VLANs, and\n\n189\n00:11:48.044 --> 00:11:49.990\nnotice that they're all up.\n\n190\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.290\nCuz I've actually turned them up,\n\n191\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.360\nto make sure that they were actually\nworking the way that we want to.\n\n192\n00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.901\nWonderful, okay, so\nas long as I've done that, and\n\n193\n00:11:57.901 --> 00:12:02.790\nI also need to verify that I have\nIP routing turned on, too, okay?\n\n194\n00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.810\nSo this one, though,\ndoesn't show up as easily.\n\n195\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.102\nSo I'm gonna do a show,\n\n196\n00:12:09.102 --> 00:12:14.040\ndo show running-config,\n\n197\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.844\nhere do show running-config.\n\n198\n00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:25.100\nAnd now you can go and you can see it.\n\n199\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.010\nI knew it was right here near the top.\n\n200\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.100\nYou have to make sure\nthat that is in there.\n\n201\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.193\nIf it's not, it's not going to work.\n\n202\n00:12:31.193 --> 00:12:36.168\nAll right, so now that we've got\neverything turned on the way we want to,\n\n203\n00:12:36.168 --> 00:12:37.942\nlet's go to NYACCESS1.\n\n204\n00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:42.320\nAnd let's begin our pinging\nto verify connectivity here.\n\n205\n00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.605\nSo on NYACCESS1,\nI am going to ping 192.168.16.10.\n\n206\n00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:50.771\nThat should be that PC that we have.\n\n207\n00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.424\nWe're actually pinging from this switch,\nand\n\n208\n00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:56.550\nwe'll see here in a moment\nif it accepts it.\n\n209\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.718\nI have to get out of this, of course.\n\n210\n00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:04.957\nNow I can ping 192.168.16.10.\n\n211\n00:13:04.957 --> 00:13:09.948\nSo notice that actually successfully\nverified what we wanted it to be able\n\n212\n00:13:09.948 --> 00:13:11.326\nto do.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n213\n00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:11.965\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n214\n00:13:11.965 --> 00:13:17.607\nthen let's take a look at our\nrouting table on NYCORE1 again,\n\n215\n00:13:17.607 --> 00:13:21.768\nto verify that we can get\naccess to all of them.\n\n216\n00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:22.511\nLet me get out of that there.\n\n217\n00:13:25.233 --> 00:13:26.745\nDo show ip route.\n\n218\n00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:36.161\nSo I wanna verify that I have\na network for 16, which I do, and\n\n219\n00:13:36.161 --> 00:13:39.690\n17, which is perfectly fine, and 18.\n\n220\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.241\nSo the great thing is we can verify that\nwe can see, well, all of those routes\n\n221\n00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:46.564\nare where they need to be.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n222\n00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:47.712\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's go ahead and\n\n223\n00:13:47.712 --> 00:13:50.009\ndo some other things here\nto check on our status and\n\n224\n00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:52.930\nbe able to troubleshoot\na couple of things, right?\n\n225\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.910\nIt is not a routing table,\nwe know it's not gonna be there.\n\n226\n00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.360\nIf you saw what I saw when I\ndid the show IP interface brief\n\n227\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.920\nwhere the vlan didn't exist\nis not gonna work for us.\n\n228\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.730\nMake sure that those are configured.\n\n229\n00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.250\nIf you didn't do a no shutdown\nafter creating the VLAN interfaces,\n\n230\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.980\nit's not going to work for\nyou either, okay?\n\n231\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.560\nIf you're missing the IP routing command,\nit's not gonna work for you.\n\n232\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.440\nSo you can see that there's a lot\nof little tiny things that can just\n\n233\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.570\neasily break everything\nthat you've already set up.\n\n234\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.860\nAnd it's just fat fingering it, like I did\nhere, where the typos are getting you, or\n\n235\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.660\nif it's just because you\nforgot to implement something,\n\n236\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.300\nit's pretty hefty here, okay.\n\n237\n00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:41.065\nSo let's go to a show interface status,\nat this point.\n\n238\n00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:49.443\nThe other thing that the interface\nstatus helps us to show,\n\n239\n00:14:49.443 --> 00:14:52.586\nright, is such as fast Ethernet 0/1.\n\n240\n00:14:52.586 --> 00:14:56.491\nNotice it also has\nthe correct Vlan number.\n\n241\n00:14:56.491 --> 00:14:59.971\nSo if you are expecting, hopefully,\n\n242\n00:14:59.971 --> 00:15:05.316\nFa0/1 to be in Vlan 16,\nwell, you're good, okay?\n\n243\n00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:07.697\nBut it is supposed to be Vlan 17.\n\n244\n00:15:07.697 --> 00:15:10.531\nWell, then that means that you\nneed to actually need to check on\n\n245\n00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:11.976\nthe configuration of whether or\n\n246\n00:15:11.976 --> 00:15:15.080\nnot this interface was assigned\nto the right Vlan, okay?\n\n247\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.273\nSo those are actually gonna be key for\nyou.\n\n248\n00:15:17.273 --> 00:15:18.456\nSo NYACCESS1,\n\n249\n00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:23.700\nthis the one I believe is actually\nconnected to that PC that we see, oops.\n\n250\n00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:30.238\nOkay, and so all the rest of them\nare actually assigned to Vlan 1,\n\n251\n00:15:30.238 --> 00:15:31.640\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n252\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.236\nAnd then we have that trunk port down\nhere at the very end, too, okay?\n\n253\n00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:40.516\nAll right, the other thing, of course,\n\n254\n00:15:40.516 --> 00:15:45.600\nthen is let's do it from here as well,\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n255\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.832\nSee if it allows us to do this.\n\n256\n00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.984\nAnd when we start seeing this right here,\nwe can of course see also,\n\n257\n00:15:53.984 --> 00:15:58.773\nokay that the VLANs that we have,\nokay, are actually configured the way\n\n258\n00:15:58.773 --> 00:16:03.119\nthat we thought that they were to\nbe configured, is what we want.\n\n259\n00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:04.716\nSo that's actually good.\n\n260\n00:16:04.716 --> 00:16:11.667\nAnd then one more show interfaces trunk.\n\n261\n00:16:14.337 --> 00:16:18.719\nVerifying that only those interfaces\nthat you want on that trunk is\n\n262\n00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:21.170\nactually allowed to do so.\n\n263\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.481\nThough all that's actually possible\nwhen you start doing this.\n\n264\n00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:26.176\nNow take a look at this from each device,\nright, and\n\n265\n00:16:26.176 --> 00:16:30.220\nverify that those are the configurations\nyou're expecting to see.\n\n266\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.108\nIf there's something out of order and\nit's not working, I would check there.\n\n267\n00:16:34.108 --> 00:16:37.190\nFor me, it's usually a typo error, okay?\n\n268\n00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.852\nSome way, somehow I just misconfigured\nby typing in an 18 instead of a 16,\n\n269\n00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:45.320\neven though I think they're\nidentically the same.\n\n270\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.580\nSo check out your typo errors, not\nshutting down the port when they should be\n\n271\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.210\nup, okay, so forgetting to\nissue the no shutdown command.\n\n272\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.640\nThose are fairly simple things,\n\n273\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.918\nbut it is something that can stop\nthe entire process from working.\n\n274\n00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:03.150\nSo now, Zach,\nthrough both of the part one and\n\n275\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.020\npart two, we've seen the router\non a stick configuration.\n\n276\n00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.180\nWe've now seen the interVLAN routing\nusing a layer 3 switch as well.\n\n277\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.100\nAnd that really is gonna be\nthe configuration that you'll probably see\n\n278\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.370\nmore often in a production environment.\n\n279\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.750\nSo Zach, that's a good place for\nus to end our lesson here on the idea of\n\n280\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.380\nusing interVLAN routing to help us as\nwe actually start adding in more VLANs.\n\n281\n00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:24.970\n&gt;&gt; Great job,\n\n282\n00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.380\nRonnie, and configure interVLAN routing\nparts one and two, see them both.\n\n283\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.010\nAnd before we move on, I'm gonna ask\nRonnie if he has any last words.\n\n284\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, just again,\n\n285\n00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.600\na great reminder at this point, right?\n\n286\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.472\nYou gotta practice, that's pretty much it.\n&gt;&gt; Practice, practice, practice.\n\n287\n00:17:39.472 --> 00:17:40.200\n&gt;&gt; At this point,\n\n288\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.840\nthere are enough labs that you and\nI have walked through together.\n\n289\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.830\nIt should be a part of your common,\neveryday activity to do them, and\n\n290\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.600\nto understand what it\nis that you're doing.\n\n291\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.847\nAnd to work with them to the point where\nthey become almost rote for you to do so.\n\n292\n00:17:55.847 --> 00:17:59.111\nAnd you don't have to worry about\nwhat the next step is gonna be,\n\n293\n00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.810\nyou simply just know.\n\n294\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.350\nNow, speed is important.\n\n295\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.410\nI don't know how else to tell you that.\n\n296\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.200\nYou've got to get faster at doing this.\n\n297\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.240\nStart typing it slow, but try and\ntype in as quickly as you can,\n\n298\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.860\neven if you get errors in\ndoing it in terms of typos.\n\n299\n00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.790\nIt just makes you type it in again.\n\n300\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.580\nSo try it, just continue to move faster,\nmake sure your mind understands what it is\n\n301\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.040\nyou're typing, and\nthen verify, verify, verify.\n\n302\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.470\nKnow those show commands.\n\n303\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.590\nDo not always depend on show\nrunning-config do show you.\n\n304\n00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.545\nMake sure you take a look at all of those\ndifferent show commands that we've been\n\n305\n00:18:35.545 --> 00:18:38.096\nusing throughout the entirety\nof the course here.\n\n306\n00:18:38.096 --> 00:18:40.995\nBecause those are also gonna be for\nthe exam as well.\n\n307\n00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.419\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ronnie, great advice.\n\n308\n00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:44.390\nCisco CCENT is a marvelous series.\n\n309\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.681\nRonnie's worked very hard\nputting that together for you.\n\n310\n00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:47.990\nMake sure you see every episode.\n\n311\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.860\nAnd when you're in that course library,\n\n312\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.550\ncheck out the other thousands of videos\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n313\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.724\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n314\n00:18:56.724 --> 00:18:58.525\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n315\n00:18:58.525 --> 00:18:59.396\nThanks for watching.\n\n316\n00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:00.900\nI'm Zach

The guys show how to create a static route and show how the destination side has to be configured with a static route back or using a default route. They also show the routing table to verify that static routes are in the routing lookup table.  Lastly, the team configures a floating static route to recover from a routing failure.",

00:00:13.371\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:16.660\nchoosing ITPro TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.480\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n6\n00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.590\nThis episode is\nConfigure Static Routing IPv4, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.990\nthe person bring us the information\nwe need is the one,\n\n8\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.021\nthe only, Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:30.145\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, good to see you again.\n\n10\n00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:30.703\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:34.080\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue forward in our journey together\n\n12\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.160\nin learning more about CCENT,\ngetting prepared for\n\n13\n00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.470\nthat exam, but also in understanding,\nof course, the fundamentals of routing.\n\n14\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.680\nSo we're diving back into static routing.\n\n15\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.720\nWe already did a comparison of dynamic\nrouting protocols versus static routing\n\n16\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.220\nprotocols to show an example of each, but\n\n17\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.690\nwe wanted to do this\na little bit more in depth.\n\n18\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.299\nSo we're gonna show you, of course,\nthe idea of configuring with IPv4.\n\n19\n00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.367\nAnd then we're also gonna end\nup showing you, at some point,\n\n20\n00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:02.158\nprobably another episode, were going\nto show you configuring with IPV6.\n\n21\n00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:03.907\nAnd that what you'll get both of them and\n\n22\n00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:07.460\nyou'll actually understand that\nstatic routing will work with both.\n\n23\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.920\nSo that is what we're going\nto end up doing here, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.360\nSo in our example we've been using\npractice labs throughout the entire series\n\n25\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.010\nso far but on this one I've decided\nto kind of change up a little bit\n\n26\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.510\nto help us out because somewhere\nin the background, right?\n\n27\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.812\nThe way that practice lab, they've got a\npreconfig lab and it does everything that\n\n28\n00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:31.575\nwe want it to do but it just didn't do\neverything I wanted it to do, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:34.123\nSo that means that there\nwere some things coming in\n\n30\n00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:38.067\nunusual ways that I didn't take the time\nto try and go, let's explain this,\n\n31\n00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:41.000\nI wanted you to see the direct\nprocess in routing.\n\n32\n00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.670\nSo I went a different way and\nI brought up my\n\n33\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.870\nown lab here as we get started.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n34\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.440\n&gt;&gt; So let me show you the diagram that\n\n35\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.720\nwe'll be using and I named them the same\nthing do that you can try this.\n\n36\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.970\nSo the basic configuration is the same\nas what you'll see in practice labs.\n\n37\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.100\nSo if you go and find the configure\nthe static versus dynamic\n\n38\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.270\nrouting protocols lab it's kind of the\nsame stuff as you're seeing right here.\n\n39\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.219\nBut they've got a lot more other things\nthat are turned on because they're\n\n40\n00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.048\nalso doing the routing\nprotocols in the background.\n\n41\n00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.568\nBut for us, we're just gonna deal\nwith this diagram right here.\n\n42\n00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:20.139\nWe have NYEDGE1, NYEDGE2 as well\nas NYWAN which we've been dealing\n\n43\n00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.500\nwith throughout the entire series as well,\nokay?\n\n44\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.477\nSo what I've done is I've actually also\ncreated three different networks for us.\n\n45\n00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:33.459\nThe 10.0.12 network over\nhere on the left hand side,\n\n46\n00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.286\n172.16.13 over here on\nthe right hand side, and\n\n47\n00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:42.510\n192.168.23 over here,\ndown here at the bottom going across.\n\n48\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.923\nAs well as one more, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:46.425\nJust off to the right hand side of NYEDGE,\n\n50\n00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:50.216\nI've created a loop back address\ntrying to give us an example of\n\n51\n00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:53.890\na network that we want to build or\nreach from other networks.\n\n52\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.707\nSo, for example, I wanna be able to\nget access to this 200 network but\n\n53\n00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:00.410\nwhat if I'm actually right over here,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.350\nSuch as this interface right here,\n10.0.12.2, what if I'm here,\n\n55\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.190\ncan I actually create a route\nthat also gets me over here,\n\n56\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.240\ntoo, and gets me access to the networks\nthat I'm not directly connected to, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.390\nSo that is what we're gonna\nset up using static routing.\n\n58\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.370\nAnd we wanna point out\na few different things,\n\n59\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.100\nof course, in the routing table\nto also help us out, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.510\nSo that means we have to configure\nIP addresses on the interfaces,\n\n61\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.470\nwe've got to configure them correctly.\n\n62\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.460\nWe also are using static\ninterfaces this time.\n\n63\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.320\nNow on the static interfaces here, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.330\nFor us is really not any real big\ndifference, you do have to add in one more\n\n65\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.280\ncommand and actually don't even have to,\nby default it does it's own capsulation.\n\n66\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.800\nSo you don't have to worry about this,\nokay?\n\n67\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.550\nSo all we have to do is add an IP address,\nmake sure the interfaces are turned on,\n\n68\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.770\nand they'll basically work the same way,\nokay?\n\n69\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.010\nSo I've gone ahead and\nI've configured the IP addresses.\n\n70\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.030\nNow I do want you to pay attention.\n\n71\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.580\nNormally when you see this in\nterms of diagrams not only for\n\n72\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.640\nthe exam, but mainly for the exam, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.560\nWhenever you see this kind of\nlightning bolt shape here,\n\n74\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.900\nthat indicates a serial connection, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.170\nIn that serial connection,\nusually it is a point to point connection,\n\n76\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.190\nand what that really means for you and me,\n\n77\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.550\nright, is that there is only two available\nIP addresses allowed on that network.\n\n78\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.554\nAnd that's why you see the /30, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:27.554 --> 00:04:32.461\nThe /30 means the first 32 bits\nout of the entire 32-bit address\n\n80\n00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:37.527\nis gonna be your network ID, and that\nnow leaves us with 2 bits that you and\n\n81\n00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.850\nI can use for the actual host\nbits that we have available.\n\n82\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.420\nSo we only have really two addresses that\nwe can use, and that's gonna be the very\n\n83\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.990\nfirst address in the network, and\nthen the next one that's available.\n\n84\n00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.676\nWe can't use the other two\nthere cuz if you take two bits,\n\n85\n00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:55.195\nwell that gives you four\npossible combinations here.\n\n86\n00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:58.230\nSo you can't use the network ID,\nyou can't use the broadcast ID, so\n\n87\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.980\nthat leaves us those two\nright here in the middle.\n\n88\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.060\nSo every single one I picked .1 and\n.2 just to keep it simple for\n\n89\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.020\nwhat we want to do, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.420\nSo once we've got all of that set up,\n\n91\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.400\nwhich we already got that set up,\nwe wanna verify connectivity first, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.820\nI wanna make sure that all\nof these devices can see\n\n93\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.110\nthe devices that they are directly\nconnected to, is what we want, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.684\nSo let's start off with NYWAN1 here and\nthis will help us out, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:31.777\nSo in my configuration here, let me\nsee if I can get back out here, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:31.777 --> 00:05:34.770\nSo now I'm in the privileged exec mode,\n\n97\n00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.060\nlet me zoom in just a little bit and\nthat will get us started here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.688\nSo on NYWAN1, let me begin by pinging, and\n\n99\n00:05:43.688 --> 00:05:48.591\nI wanna ping NYEDGE1,\nwhich is gonna be 192.168,\n\n100\n00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:54.320\nactually I'm lying to you,\nthat's gonna be 10.0.12.1.\n\n101\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.477\nAnd I am actually able to get access to\nthat particular one, okay, so that's fine.\n\n102\n00:06:00.477 --> 00:06:05.511\nNow I also want to ping NYEDGE2,\nokay, which is over here,\n\n103\n00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:10.650\nwhich is this .2, so 192.168.23.2.\n\n104\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.791\nSo now if I ping, ping 192.168.23.2.\n\n105\n00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:19.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:21.373\n&gt;&gt; I can actually pin that.\n\n107\n00:06:21.373 --> 00:06:26.213\nWell, there is also of course another\nconfiguration which this other two\n\n108\n00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:28.650\ninterfaces over here, right?\n\n109\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.540\nOn the other side of NYEDGE2 and\n\n110\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.140\non the other side of NYEDGE1 I\nhave these interfaces as well.\n\n111\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.772\nLets try and pin those guys as well, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:38.772 --> 00:06:44.473\nSo ping 172.16.13.1.\n\n113\n00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:51.440\nThis is off of NYEDGE1 and now I'm not\nable to get access over there, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.840\nSo you're seeing where all\nthe pings are dropping.\n\n115\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.060\nAnd this dropping is again telling\nme that I'm not connected.\n\n116\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.020\nBut we know something about routers,\nright?\n\n117\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.160\nThe fact is, if I try and ping and it says\nlook, that's actually gonna be an address,\n\n118\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.636\nI don't know where that is, let me\nlook it up in my routing table then.\n\n119\n00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.178\nShow ip route.\n\n120\n00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:15.496\nWell, you can see according to the legend,\n\n121\n00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:19.100\nwe have of course the directly\nconnected networks right?\n\n122\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:27.100\nSo on NYWAN1 we're directly connected to\nthis 10.12 network, okay, that /30, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.430\nNow, that is a network destination for\nus or what we call a network route.\n\n124\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.790\nAnd it lets me know that I'm directly\nconnected and I can get to it,\n\n125\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:43.070\nleaving serial as 0/1 off of NYWAN1,\nokay, so I can do that.\n\n126\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.025\nWe also have in the table the letter\nL which we'll only see with\n\n127\n00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:50.893\nthe iOS version 15 or later here.\n\n128\n00:07:50.893 --> 00:07:55.823\nSo anything like that, but\nnotice that this one has another one, but\n\n129\n00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:59.996\nyou can see that there's\nactually gonna be well A /32.\n\n130\n00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:03.196\n/32 says,\nthis is what we call a host route,\n\n131\n00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:06.084\nis what this is actually called here okay?\n\n132\n00:08:06.084 --> 00:08:11.186\nSo this host route allows me to also be\nable to look this up instead of having to\n\n133\n00:08:11.186 --> 00:08:16.610\ngo through the variables subnetting\nhere and then figure out where it goes.\n\n134\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.110\nIt says, I've already installed\nthat into the table, so\n\n135\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.220\nif you directly wanna get there,\nyou don't have to look any farther.\n\n136\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.820\nIt goes ahead and puts it in.\n\n137\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.060\nBut if you're running iOS 12,\n\n138\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.680\nyou won't see that l inside\nof your routing table, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.330\nSo in this sense, right,\nI do not have access to\n\n140\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.820\nthat 172.16.13.0 network,\nbut I want access to it.\n\n141\n00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.190\nAlso want access to this 200\nnetwork over here as well.\n\n142\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.040\nSo let's go ahead and\nchange this up to help us out, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.200\nSo the way that we do that, right?\n\n144\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.170\nIf I want to get another route\nin to the routing table.\n\n145\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.236\nI need to start with static routes, so\n\n146\n00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:56.831\nlet's go into our global\nconfiguration mode.\n\n147\n00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:02.523\nAnd inside of the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n148\n00:09:02.523 --> 00:09:08.110\nnow I can begin typing in IP route and\nthen 172.16.13.0,\n\n149\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.827\nand then I need that 30 bit subnet mask,\nwhich is gonna be\n\n150\n00:09:12.827 --> 00:09:19.290\n255.255.255.252, now I need\nto tell it the next top.\n\n151\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.760\nSo from NY1 here I have two possibilities,\n\n152\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.850\nI can enter both of them in if I want to,\nokay?\n\n153\n00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.270\nSo I can actually type in and\n\n154\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.240\nsay go directly to NYEDGE2 and\nthat will get me over here.\n\n155\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:39.760\nOr, I can say, let's go from here to\nNYEDGE1 and then go over here, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.360\nSo those are my two possibilities.\n\n157\n00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.820\nBoth of them are actually\njust a single hop, right?\n\n158\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.890\nSo one from here and then you're there,\nand then one from here.\n\n159\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.000\nWell, if I enter this in, it's gonna\nbe equally load balanced across them\n\n160\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.890\nbecause it's only two hops away,\nokay, so that's what we're gonna see.\n\n161\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.460\nSo I'm just gonna choose one for\nright now, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.660\nJust to help us out, okay?\n\n163\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.110\nSo when I do this here, I'm just gonna\nchoose the one that goes to NYEDGE1.\n\n164\n00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.430\nSo my next hop is gonna be 10.0.12.1,\nokay?\n\n165\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.930\nIt's what's going to be.\n\n166\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.940\nSo let's go back over here to NYLAN1 here,\n\n167\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.710\nlet me see if I can zoom out here for\na moment.\n\n168\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:25.147\nAnd then let's go back down here and\nzoom back in, so we can see it.\n\n169\n00:10:25.147 --> 00:10:30.772\nSo there's gonna be 10.0.12.1 And now,\n\n170\n00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:38.005\nif I type in a do show IP route, And\nI scroll over to the left hand side,\n\n171\n00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:42.440\nI can now see my static route here,\nto be able to get access.\n\n172\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.790\nNow, remember what's inside of\nthese brackets here, right?\n\n173\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.160\nThe first number is my\nadministrative distance.\n\n174\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.180\nThe second one here is the metric\nthat it's giving me, okay, so\n\n175\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.620\nall static routes has\nadministrative distance of 1 which\n\n176\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.760\nmeans you have manually configured it and\nthat will always stay there.\n\n177\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.240\nSo even if we use dynamic\nrouting protocols at this point\n\n178\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.939\nto get to 172.16.13 network,\n\n179\n00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:12.780\nokay, is not going to actually get\nthis out of the rounding table, okay?\n\n180\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.130\nSo that's what we'll end up seeing as\nin that's not gonna end up happening.\n\n181\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.890\nSo now, that's actually fine, okay.\n\n182\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.120\nSo I should now be able to\nping the other side, right?\n\n183\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.130\nSo let's check this out here.\n\n184\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.550\nWhat I need to type in,\nlet me get back up here.\n\n185\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:35.772\nDo, I don't even have to do that,\nping, 172.16.13.1, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:36.706\nSo now, I can do that,\n\n187\n00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:39.700\nnow you're probably wondering\nlike what the heck is that about?\n\n188\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.390\nThat's because it only went to that one\nrouter and then it actually found it in\n\n189\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.820\nthis routing table, and\nit's able to come directly back.\n\n190\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:51.860\nLet's try to ping all the way to\nthe other side here 13.2, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.555\nNow look at this, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:57.220\n13.2 it didn't actually get to.\n\n193\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.814\nI was just able to ping 13.1,\nbut I wasn't able to ping 13.2.\n\n194\n00:12:02.814 --> 00:12:05.840\nWell, let's show you what happened, right?\n\n195\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.520\nSo if I scroll or zoom out just a bit.\n\n196\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.176\nWe started here, we sent out a ping,\nit went across to NYEDGE1,\n\n197\n00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:18.918\nit said right here on this router I\ncan reply because it looks it up on\n\n198\n00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:21.734\nthis routing table over here, right?\n\n199\n00:12:21.734 --> 00:12:25.775\nOkay, the routing table says,\nyes, I know where 10.0.12 is and\n\n200\n00:12:25.775 --> 00:12:27.576\nit sends it back, makes sense?\n\n201\n00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:28.830\nAll right.\n\n202\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.840\nNow, let's verify if that's true or not.\n\n203\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.448\nIf I go NYEDGE 1 over here and\n\n204\n00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:42.080\nnow I type in a show IP route.\n\n205\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.440\nThere it is, the ten network is\ndirectly connected, okay, so\n\n206\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.540\nwe can see and also you see here's the IP\naddress of the interface that it left.\n\n207\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.070\nSo it says, yes, I can get it back there.\n\n208\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.040\nIf I go to NYEDGE 2 though,\nokay, NYEDGE 2.\n\n209\n00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:04.550\nAnd let's check out its routing table.\n\n210\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:11.150\nNotice now right because 172,16.13.2,\n\n211\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:17.770\nit is right here but the network that I\nwas trying to reply back in my echo reply\n\n212\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.610\nwas 10.0.12 and look at this\nrouting table right here, Zach.\n\n213\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.970\nOkay, there is no 10 network listed\nat all in that routing table,\n\n214\n00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.610\nokay, so that's what we talk about\nin terms of having it at both ways,\n\n215\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.340\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n216\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.430\n&gt;&gt; If we have a route that comes back,\n\n217\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.240\nthere's two things that I can do here,\nZack, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.130\nOne initially is this,\nI could just come to NYEDGE2 and\n\n219\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.160\njust type in the IP route again,\nwith the 10 network and subnet mask.\n\n220\n00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.680\nAnd then back over to the NYEDGE1, okay?\n\n221\n00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.020\nThat interface.\n\n222\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:59.610\nBut notice that, Zach, there is this the\ngateway of last resort is not set, okay?\n\n223\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.950\nThe gateway of last resort works like\nthe default gateway on my machine that\n\n224\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.750\nsays if I wanna go out to the Internet,\nI'm not just gonna search out here.\n\n225\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.460\nI'm gonna send it to this one device\nwhich is on the edge of my network, and\n\n226\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.340\nthat's gonna route it for me.\n\n227\n00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.600\nSo here, on NYEDGE2 what I can say is,\n\n228\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.490\nif look up something in the routing table\non NYEDGE2, and is not listed here.\n\n229\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.980\nAt this point, because, again,\n\n230\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.870\nwe're at last results is not set,\nit just drops the packet.\n\n231\n00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.650\nThat exactly what happened.\n\n232\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.760\nBut if I set that, okay?\n\n233\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.940\nIf I now set it,\nI can actually tell it, well,\n\n234\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.970\nif it doesn't match here send\nit to this device instead, okay?\n\n235\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.880\nSo let's go ahead an set\na default route instead\n\n236\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.930\nhere, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n237\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.050\n&gt;&gt; So now, this is a catch all exactly,\n\n238\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.840\nif its not in the routing table,\n\n239\n00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.810\nsend it on to this router,\nis what we're essentially saying.\n\n240\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:51.360\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n241\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.290\n&gt;&gt; Let's go into our global configuration\n\n242\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.180\non NYEDGE2.\n\n243\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.990\nAnd once we're here,\nnow I can do an IP route and\n\n244\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.950\nthe way the default route\nlooks is strange, okay?\n\n245\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.320\nThe network actually is all zeros, and\n\n246\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.270\nthis is the same as a catch all network,\nokay?\n\n247\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.210\nSo it's the same as a wildcard,\nif you wanna call it that.\n\n248\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.380\nSays anything else that's\nnot here send it here.\n\n249\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.860\nThe other thing is we're not being\nspecific about the network as well,\n\n250\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.660\nokay, so we're saying any\nsubnet mask will also work.\n\n251\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.670\nSo any IP address,\n\n252\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.180\nany subnet mask that's not listed in the\nrouting table, where do I want to send it?\n\n253\n00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.776\nI want to send it back up to the NYEDGE1,\n\n254\n00:15:38.776 --> 00:15:44.872\non this network which was 172.16.13.1.\n\n255\n00:15:44.872 --> 00:15:49.280\nOkay, now when I type\nin a do show IP route,\n\n256\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.904\nyou can now see that the gateway\nof last resort has been set here.\n\n257\n00:15:55.904 --> 00:16:00.175\nOkay, which is here and it says,\nto network, any other place.\n\n258\n00:16:00.175 --> 00:16:01.624\nThen we're out, right?\n\n259\n00:16:01.624 --> 00:16:09.015\nSo let's go ahead and verify that this has\nactually got connectivity, 172.16.13.1.\n\n260\n00:16:09.015 --> 00:16:11.220\nSo I know I can't reach that.\n\n261\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.160\nSo now what should happen, right,\n\n262\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.257\nis if I issue a ping from NYWAN1\nagain where we failed before,\n\n263\n00:16:19.257 --> 00:16:22.983\nit not only has the ability\nto go to NYEDGE1,\n\n264\n00:16:22.983 --> 00:16:27.807\nwhich says I can find it in my\nrouting table back over here.\n\n265\n00:16:27.807 --> 00:16:31.685\nBut now when it heads to router 2 and\nit says it's time for me to reply,\n\n266\n00:16:31.685 --> 00:16:36.010\nlet me look it up in the routing table, it\ndoesn't find it in the routing table but\n\n267\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.060\nit does find that last entry that you and\nI did here.\n\n268\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.680\nSo let's see if we can actually make\nthat now work and now look at it, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.960\nSo the same thing by using that\ndefault route we now have actually\n\n270\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.900\nfixed that idea of using the static\nIP address to help us out.\n\n271\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.971\nSo a static routing is\nvery valuable in terms\n\n272\n00:16:55.971 --> 00:17:00.795\nof what we need it to do as long as\nthe network doesn't change, okay?\n\n273\n00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:05.709\nSo what kinda change could happen to\na network that would cause issues?\n\n274\n00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:11.090\nWell, let's go ahead and take a look\nat this idea just briefly, okay?\n\n275\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:16.120\nSo I haven't configured anything\nacross this bottom route yet, okay.\n\n276\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.840\nLet's say for an example, NYEDGE1,\nlet's say something happens to it.\n\n277\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.958\nI don't know what, okay.\n\n278\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.430\nBut let's say something\nhappens to this interface.\n\n279\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.231\nSomebody unplugs it, whatever it might be,\nit doesn't really matter, okay.\n\n280\n00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:34.654\nSo now, I need to switch over to NYEDGE1,\nand now once I'm in NYEDGE1,\n\n281\n00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:39.291\nI go into my global configuration mode and\nthen interface, and\n\n282\n00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:45.089\nI'm just gonna choose one of them,\nI don't know which one I'm gonna choose.\n\n283\n00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:49.890\nLet's just do serial S1/0.\n\n284\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.734\nAnd we'll mimic, let's say\na breakdown in the link somewhere,\n\n285\n00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:57.650\nby issuing a shutdown command, okay.\n\n286\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.130\nSo now that I've issued\na shutdown command,\n\n287\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.620\nlogically that means if I\nissue that same ping again,\n\n288\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.510\nmeaning NYWAN1, it's gonna go here and\nit's not gonna be able to respond.\n\n289\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.287\nSo even this interface shouldn't respond,\nif that one doesn't respond because it's\n\n290\n00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:19.790\nbeen shut down, it means I can't get\nany replies going over here either.\n\n291\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:25.050\nSo this guy can't answer, this one can't\nanswer either, it doesn't really matter.\n\n292\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.580\nSo in that sense, that's where\nstatic routing breaks down, right?\n\n293\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:35.420\nI can't configure the static routing to\nessentially overcome that breakdown, okay?\n\n294\n00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.810\nBut if you and\nI were running a dynamic routing protocol,\n\n295\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.780\nwhich we'll see a little bit later on,\nit could just recalculate and\n\n296\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.130\ngo look,\nI know about a route over here and\n\n297\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:50.520\nso this guy can actually go instead, let\nme send it along this path instead, okay?\n\n298\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.030\nNow, there is another thing that you can\ndo, okay, that can also help us out,\n\n299\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.260\nespecially with something like this.\n\n300\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.710\nLet's say that NYWAN1 to NYEDGE1, and\n\n301\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.530\nthen over here to NYEDGE2,\nthat is our preferred route to go,\n\n302\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.920\nto be able to get access\nto what we want to, okay?\n\n303\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.830\nThat's perfectly fine, we like that, okay?\n\n304\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.980\nLet's say that that's because\nit's a private network, nice and\n\n305\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.930\nsecure, we want to use that one.\n\n306\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.730\nEven though this might look like\nit's a shorter hop to get over there\n\n307\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.900\nto that point, we don't want to use\nthis one unless we need to, okay.\n\n308\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.170\nSo let's make it actually easier.\n\n309\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.280\nWe'll use this 200 network over\nhere on the side to help us out.\n\n310\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.000\nSo let's start off with NYWAN1 here and\n\n311\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.099\nlet's go ahead and\nset up a route all the way over to NYWAN1.\n\n312\n00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:44.312\nAll right, the NYEDGE2 and\nthat network 200.\n\n313\n00:19:44.312 --> 00:19:46.483\nSo let me go into\nthe global configuration.\n\n314\n00:19:49.944 --> 00:19:51.108\nOops.\n\n315\n00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:55.792\nSorry, my mouth and my hands\nstarted typing the same words, and\n\n316\n00:19:55.792 --> 00:20:01.368\nthey're not supposed to be,\nit's supposed to be config terminal, okay.\n\n317\n00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:05.933\nSo once I get to your configured terminal,\nokay,\n\n318\n00:20:05.933 --> 00:20:12.480\nlet's set up another route,\nip route 200.200.200.0.\n\n319\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.410\nAnd then this is a 24-bit subnet mask,\nI know because I set it up.\n\n320\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.470\nAnd I'm gonna tell I want it\nto deliver the same pathway\n\n321\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.460\nthat we normally would go.\n\n322\n00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.040\nLet's verify that that works.\n\n323\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.913\nI'm gonna issue a no shutdown.\n\n324\n00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:33.584\nAnd let's bring that link back up,\n\n325\n00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:36.679\nnow let's verify that this\nguy will actually work.\n\n326\n00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:41.256\nDo ping 200.200.200.2 here, okay.\n\n327\n00:20:41.256 --> 00:20:43.866\nNow this one is showing something\na little bit more unusual,\n\n328\n00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:46.170\nit's saying undeliverable at this point.\n\n329\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.070\nSo that means that there's something else\nalong the way that's not working, right.\n\n330\n00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.083\nSo l send it that way,\nso what am l missing?\n\n331\n00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:55.611\nWell, what l'm missing is NYEDGE1.\n\n332\n00:20:55.611 --> 00:21:01.554\nNYEDGE1, which l did not account for,\ndo show ip route,\n\n333\n00:21:01.554 --> 00:21:07.395\nnotice it doesn't have any\nroute to the 200 network.\n\n334\n00:21:07.395 --> 00:21:11.811\nSo along the path, if l wanna this with\nstatic routing, and that's what you see as\n\n335\n00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:16.439\nadministratively it takes some time here\nif you don't get it configured correctly.\n\n336\n00:21:16.439 --> 00:21:23.762\nSo here we do ip route 200.200.200.2,\n\n337\n00:21:23.762 --> 00:21:27.667\n24-bit subnet mask, and\n\n338\n00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:35.816\nthen we're gonna forward\nthis on to 16.13.2 here.\n\n339\n00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:41.340\nNow inconsistent address, that was me,\nI did a fat finger typo here.\n\n340\n00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.953\nIt's saying hey, I don't know what that\nmask is, let's try that one instead.\n\n341\n00:21:46.953 --> 00:21:50.736\nYou wanna know something,\nit's me on both instances here,\n\n342\n00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:53.271\nit's only going to the 200 network.\n\n343\n00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:58.566\nThat's just my fat fingering,\nyeah I tell you, there we go finally.\n\n344\n00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:03.420\nIf it wasn't for me not being able to\nactually remember, it only needs a network\n\n345\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.180\nID, not the actual 32-bit mask here,\nthen we are now ready to go.\n\n346\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:14.987\nSo do show ip route.\n\n347\n00:22:14.987 --> 00:22:19.482\nAnd now, I have this and\nlet's verify that I can ping from here.\n\n348\n00:22:19.482 --> 00:22:24.500\nDo ping 200.200.200.2, okay?\n\n349\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.385\nSo, Zach, do you see why static routing,\neven though it works,\n\n350\n00:22:27.385 --> 00:22:29.377\nany of those routers along the path,\nright,\n\n351\n00:22:29.377 --> 00:22:32.368\nif it loses that connection we have\nto go in and manually follow it and\n\n352\n00:22:32.368 --> 00:22:36.372\nreconfigure it to make it all work.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n353\n00:22:36.372 --> 00:22:38.937\n&gt;&gt; So now, let's verify once again from\n\n354\n00:22:38.937 --> 00:22:43.785\nhere because we probably haven't\nactually seen that one before here.\n\n355\n00:22:43.785 --> 00:22:47.030\nSo now let's see, there we go,\nokay, so there it is.\n\n356\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.680\nIt's now successful, we now know\nthat we can get that route, okay.\n\n357\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.140\nBut what we wanna do is we wanna set\nup something else over here, okay.\n\n358\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.915\nWhat I want is even with static routing,\nokay, is to make sure of something.\n\n359\n00:22:59.915 --> 00:23:03.840\nThat if for one reason or another,\nthis path right here breaks down,\n\n360\n00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.149\nI want another route to be entered here.\n\n361\n00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:08.391\nNow, and we're not talking about\na dynamic routing protocol,\n\n362\n00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:09.802\nwe're not getting there yet.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n363\n00:23:09.802 --> 00:23:11.042\n&gt;&gt; It can work with dynamic\n\n364\n00:23:11.042 --> 00:23:12.469\nrouting protocol as well.\n\n365\n00:23:12.469 --> 00:23:14.133\nBut what we wanna do,\n\n366\n00:23:14.133 --> 00:23:19.217\nis we wanna setup another static\nroute that will enter the table if\n\n367\n00:23:19.217 --> 00:23:22.826\nthat first route is no longer available.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n368\n00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:23.374\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n369\n00:23:23.374 --> 00:23:26.860\nthat is technically called\na floating static route.\n\n370\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.830\nIt stays, we've configured the route, but\nwe don't have it enter into the routing\n\n371\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:36.675\ntable until the other route\nis not available, okay?\n\n372\n00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:41.195\nSo that is what we also want to go ahead\nand configure at this point too, okay?\n\n373\n00:23:41.195 --> 00:23:45.535\nSo this is where, once again,\nyou have to do this on both sides as well,\n\n374\n00:23:45.535 --> 00:23:49.885\nto make sure that this ends up working\nout for us as we do that, okay?\n\n375\n00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:55.977\nSo, let's go and enter this in\non the one side of this point,\n\n376\n00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:59.565\nwhich will also do this too, okay.\n\n377\n00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:03.893\nNow for us,\nthat floating static route is essentially\n\n378\n00:24:03.893 --> 00:24:07.853\ngonna be between NYWAN1,\nAnd NYEDGE2, okay?\n\n379\n00:24:07.853 --> 00:24:13.940\nSo these are the two sides that we'll\nhave to configure for that static route.\n\n380\n00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.770\nNow we're also got to change\nthis up like that default\n\n381\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.270\ngateway will also enter that\nin to make sure that also\n\n382\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.420\ngets in here only if something else\nbreaks at that point too, okay?\n\n383\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.204\nSo normally is actually\ndone with static routes, so\n\n384\n00:24:29.204 --> 00:24:33.140\nI may have to remove that default gateway\nroute for this to end up working.\n\n385\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.390\nBut let's see what happens here.\n\n386\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:41.696\nSo, on NYWAN1, IP route, okay?\n\n387\n00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:48.706\nAnd then 200.200.200.0 this\ntime is the network [LAUGH].\n\n388\n00:24:48.706 --> 00:24:55.219\nAnd now I'm gonna tell it 192.168.23.2.\n\n389\n00:24:55.219 --> 00:24:59.950\nNow, I'm gonna do a question\nmark to help us out as well.\n\n390\n00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.270\nRight here is what we're looking for,\n\n391\n00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:08.060\nwhich is the distance metric for\nthis route, okay?\n\n392\n00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.790\nWhat we are actually trying to do right,\napparently we know something, now,\n\n393\n00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.630\nright now it has a distance of zero, okay?\n\n394\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.520\nCuz we saw where it's directed connected\nor WAN or something like that, okay?\n\n395\n00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:24.090\nSo I want to set this a higher number\nto actually be able to get in there.\n\n396\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:28.730\nSo if that one disappears,\nthat static disappears, use this one.\n\n397\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.930\nBut if I go ahead and just turn it on\nright now like this, it's gonna equal and\n\n398\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.250\nit's gonna put both routes in there, okay?\n\n399\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.700\nAnd that is what I don't want, I only\nwant one route showing up for right now.\n\n400\n00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.090\nSo, I'm just gonna set this one up, right?\n\n401\n00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:47.710\nLet's just do, I'm trying to think,\nwe'll do 5 just as an example, okay?\n\n402\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.350\nSo that should be higher than the static\nrouter that's already in there.\n\n403\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:58.170\nDo show ip route, okay?\n\n404\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.696\nSo notice that it didn't add\nin another route end so far.\n\n405\n00:26:05.696 --> 00:26:11.512\nAnd instead of looking for 192.168.23.2,\n\n406\n00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:16.730\nit's still showing only one static route,\nokay?\n\n407\n00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.570\nSo that's fine,\nthat's what we want to be able to do.\n\n408\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.400\nNow, let's see what happens now, okay?\n\n409\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.223\nIf I shut down that same interface\nthat we were doing a little\n\n410\n00:26:28.223 --> 00:26:30.770\nbit earlier here, okay?\n\n411\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:35.540\nSo we are simulating\na failure of the upper route.\n\n412\n00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:40.930\nSo I've just turned off this interface,\nso now when we want to issue that ping,\n\n413\n00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.750\nit might issue it and go hey,\nthat is actually in the routing table.\n\n414\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.311\nBut now, when it does that lookup,\nlet's see what happens here.\n\n415\n00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:55.590\nGo back to NYWAN1, and\nnow let's try it again.\n\n416\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.509\nPing 200.200.200.2\n\n417\n00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:06.480\nAnds now it's actually not working at all,\nokay?\n\n418\n00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.214\nSo that's fine because even if\nwe were able to, so we'll know,\n\n419\n00:27:10.214 --> 00:27:14.985\nif the routing table changes here, we'll\nknow that it's set up completely, but\n\n420\n00:27:14.985 --> 00:27:18.400\nit's not,\ncuz we haven't done anything yet.\n\n421\n00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:25.415\nDo show ip route, no sorry,\nshow ip route, so used to doing that.\n\n422\n00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.409\nNow, let's take a look, and notice,\nit's not actually there yet,\n\n423\n00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:33.868\nbecause i t is starting to find something,\n\n424\n00:27:33.868 --> 00:27:38.310\nbut we haven't set up the other side so\nit can actually respond as well.\n\n425\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.740\nSo it could be that I haven't set\nup that number high enough yet, so\n\n426\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.640\nit's still showing a 1 and\na 0 listed in here statically.\n\n427\n00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.137\nSo I need to make sure that I get that\none changed the way that we want to as\n\n428\n00:27:51.137 --> 00:27:52.060\nwell, okay?\n\n429\n00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.690\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll switch over routers and do that.\n\n430\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.110\nAll right, so\nlet's go over to NYEDGE2 then, okay?\n\n431\n00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.460\nSo on NYEDGE2,\nlet's take a look at show IP\n\n432\n00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.460\nroute, and let's take a look of\nwhat we're seeing here too, okay?\n\n433\n00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.100\nSo now l still don't have anything the get\nway of last result is still set to\n\n434\n00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.920\nthis particular address up here,\nthat's fine for right now, okay?\n\n435\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.080\nSo, we know that this is probably the\nreason is not responding back to things.\n\n436\n00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.060\nBecause even though if the floating\nstatic route got over here,\n\n437\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.310\nknows there's nothing else right here,\nright?\n\n438\n00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.720\nIn that ten network, okay?\n\n439\n00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.940\nThat's going across.\n\n440\n00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.200\nSo let's go back to NYWAN1 here, and\n\n441\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.510\nlet's go ahead and run,\nI went ahead and set this up here.\n\n442\n00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.640\nI ran that show ip route again, and\nnow you can see the static route\n\n443\n00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.760\ndid end up changing, and now that's\nwithout me configuring anything.\n\n444\n00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.999\nSo when we showed you before, it was\nthe exact same route that we had before so\n\n445\n00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:57.920\nit showed everything, and\nyou can see where it's actually changed.\n\n446\n00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:05.930\nSo let's try it again and make sure that's\nnot a fluke here, but there it goes, okay?\n\n447\n00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.110\nIt is now able to.\n\n448\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.160\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nwhy is it able to respond back this.\n\n449\n00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:17.259\nBut remember that NYWAN1\nhas directly connected\n\n450\n00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:23.510\ninterface to 192.168.23.1, okay?\n\n451\n00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.225\nAnd over on NYEDGE2, notice that well,\n\n452\n00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:34.560\nthis one it can actually\nsee the other side as well.\n\n453\n00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.130\nSo, even though 200 is off of this router,\nit didn't have to go in the gate\n\n454\n00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.580\nway of last result because it's\nactually replying back to where?\n\n455\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.820\nIt's replying back to well,\nthat interface instead.\n\n456\n00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.820\nSo this way we can continue\nto have traffic get\n\n457\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:57.080\nall the way over to NYEDGE2,\neven if this link fails.\n\n458\n00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.450\nSo what happens if the link\ncomes back up here, okay?\n\n459\n00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:05.154\nSo watch what happens,\nwe'll get some Syslog messages here, and\n\n460\n00:30:05.154 --> 00:30:09.142\nlet me issue a no shutdown And\n\n461\n00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:13.975\nthen we can go back to NYWAN1 here, and\nwe'll see that there it goes, okay?\n\n462\n00:30:13.975 --> 00:30:18.075\nIt changed to the up here,\nlet me hit the Enter a few times so\n\n463\n00:30:18.075 --> 00:30:19.585\nthat we can see that, okay?\n\n464\n00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:23.375\nSo now, show IP route here.\n\n465\n00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:31.610\nAnd now notice that the static\nroute changed right back.\n\n466\n00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.950\nAnd it went right back into the table, it\nkicked the floating static route back out.\n\n467\n00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.580\nSo any time there's a failure with\nthat other route, it can do that.\n\n468\n00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.120\nWe can also do the same thing if we\nwere running dynamic routing protocols\n\n469\n00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.040\nand we said look,\n\n470\n00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.310\nI don't want this route to come in unless\nthe dynamic routing protocol fails.\n\n471\n00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.020\nWe would just set it to a number higher\nthan whatever the administrative distance\n\n472\n00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.660\nis for our routing protocol.\n\n473\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.587\nSo, if we're running RIP it's 120,\nwe can set it up to 200 if we want to,\n\n474\n00:30:58.587 --> 00:31:01.949\nit's just usually a bit extreme,\nor 201 whatever you wanna do.\n\n475\n00:31:01.949 --> 00:31:05.759\nBut that way we make sure that all of the\nrouting protocols are out of the table,\n\n476\n00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:08.110\nand then this one can take over, okay?\n\n477\n00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.100\nSo it does give us that advantage here,\nokay?\n\n478\n00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.630\nSo, hopefully,\nyou're actually able to see now, right?\n\n479\n00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.702\nAll of the different things that\nyou need to be able to point out.\n\n480\n00:31:17.702 --> 00:31:20.802\nBe able to recognize from routing\ntable what that default route is.\n\n481\n00:31:20.802 --> 00:31:25.558\nBe able to identify a network route here,\nwhich we showed you as well as a subnet\n\n482\n00:31:25.558 --> 00:31:28.750\nmask, a host route with\nthe 32-bit subnet mask.\n\n483\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.820\nAnd now at last here we've even shown\nyou what a floating static route\n\n484\n00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.540\ncan actually do for\nus and how it's set up.\n\n485\n00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.430\nSo, it actually does give you quite a bit\nto think about, even though static routes\n\n486\n00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:44.170\nare easy, there's a lot of ways\nthat they are dynamic in a sense.\n\n487\n00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.140\nBut do remember that,\n\n488\n00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.710\nif you any network changes, that means\nyou have to change it along the path.\n\n489\n00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.160\nAnd if there's any type of\nissue that normally happens\n\n490\n00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.510\nIs remember to configuring on one end and\nnot configuring it on the other end.\n\n491\n00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.936\nBut overall though, that should get us set\nup at least a good start in knowing and\n\n492\n00:32:00.936 --> 00:32:05.033\nunderstanding more about static routing.\n&gt;&gt; Configure static routing IPv4,\n\n493\n00:32:05.033 --> 00:32:06.984\ngreat episode, Ronnie did a great job.\n\n494\n00:32:06.984 --> 00:32:09.850\nRonnie, anything else you\nwant to say before we move\n\n495\n00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.710\non?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n496\n00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.990\nonce again it's all about practice, right?\n\n497\n00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.740\nSo you don't have to set up one like\nwhat I just did with three routers\n\n498\n00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.120\ninside of your practice lab.\n\n499\n00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.910\nYou can actually just use\nthe link between two routers and\n\n500\n00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:25.520\nset up a static route in between those,\nand make sure that it works as well, okay?\n\n501\n00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.700\nNow, a bit hard to do the floating\nstatic route with two routers, but\n\n502\n00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.550\noverall though,\nyou understand the concept.\n\n503\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.925\nAnd that probably won't get\nyou in terms of the exam,\n\n504\n00:32:34.925 --> 00:32:38.400\non trying to configure\na floating static route.\n\n505\n00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.190\nBut it's something that's a scenario\nthat might help you out of what happens\n\n506\n00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.200\nif you need another route and you're only\nusing static routing to get in there.\n\n507\n00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.700\nBut you need to make sure it\ntakes place very quickly,\n\n508\n00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.140\ninstead of you having to\nmanually come along and fix it.\n\n509\n00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.880\nA floating static route may be\nyour best friend at that point.\n\n510\n00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.800\n&gt;&gt; Great job Ronnie, and\n\n511\n00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.750\nthere's gonna be so\nmuch more in the Cisco CSense Series.\n\n512\n00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.860\nMake sure you watch every episode,\nit's good for you, and\n\n513\n00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.270\nit'll help you in the long run too.\n\n514\n00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.330\nAnd while you're in the course library\nthere's thousands of other videos there,\n\n515\n00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.930\nthey're designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go for it.\n\n516\n00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.880\nUntill I'm ready you know about it for\nITPROTV, ITPROTV is bingeworthy.\n\n517\n00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.160\nThanks for

00:00:08.027\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.027 --> 00:00:12.860\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.610\nchoosing ITPro TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.290\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.533\nWe're going to configure static\nrouting IPV6 now, how about that?\n\n8\n00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.860\nAnd Ronnie Wong is here to\nhelp us with all that stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.130\nNow, Ronny, good to see you again.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.610\nhaving me back as we continue on to\ntake a look more about static routing.\n\n11\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.380\nAnd this time we're jumping into IPV6.\n\n12\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.589\nMost of the time when you start hearing\nabout it, just learning about IPV6,\n\n13\n00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.762\nit can be a little bit daunting\nbecause everything looks so\n\n14\n00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.502\ndifferent than what we're\nused to seeing IPv4.\n\n15\n00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:52.028\nBut at the same time, the great thing\nabout it is, if anything's a difference\n\n16\n00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:57.400\ninside of IPv6, it's just the format\nof the IP version six address.\n\n17\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.880\nThe only addition that's really different\nis that you tend to have to add in,\n\n18\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.710\ninstead of IP address,\nit's IPV six address..\n\n19\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.950\nAnd so when you're doing a show\nip interface brief command,\n\n20\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.090\nyou're actually just typing\nin show ipv6 interface brief.\n\n21\n00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.170\nBut the IP address is about the only thing\nthat really changes in terms of the way\n\n22\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.180\nthat we configure things,\nwhen we do something like this, right?\n\n23\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.284\nSo what we have to actually be\nable to do is remember that.\n\n24\n00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:28.620\nNow, there are other components\nthat we need to also remember too.\n\n25\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.228\nSo let's take a look at our lab\ndiagram right here too, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:32.228 --> 00:01:36.000\nSo inside of our practice labs, which is\nwhat we're trying to follow to help make\n\n27\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.460\nsure that everybody has access to labs.\n\n28\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.490\nThere is one element that they didn't\ninclude in which was static routing\n\n29\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980\nfor IPv6.\n\n30\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.670\nAnd it's officially caught\nout on the exam and\n\n31\n00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.060\nthat's why we're also covering it here.\n\n32\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.470\nSo the lab set up, again,\nit had well, nothing set up for\n\n33\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.630\nIPv6 at all, so I'm still using\na lab that I set up to mimic what\n\n34\n00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.970\nwe normally see inside of the practice\nlabs in the environment that I wanted but\n\n35\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.140\nI just eliminated all of\nthe other things here.\n\n36\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.370\nSo we're working with three\ndifferent routers and\n\n37\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.100\nhere is what we are going\nto be configuring, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.440\nSo I've got an IPv6\npublic network over here,\n\n39\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.590\nI have one over here, and\nI have one down here.\n\n40\n00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.098\nAnd the only difference between them,\nright, is I just put a one, two and\n\n41\n00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:24.190\na three just to make it easy.\n\n42\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.450\nJust to make it as easy as\npossible here when we do this and\n\n43\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.370\nthen of course interfaces\nwere also configured.\n\n44\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.320\nSo I've configured just about\nevery interface here except for\n\n45\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.230\nNYEDGE2 because I started thinking\nabout something as we began the show.\n\n46\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.240\nAnd as I was re-configuring the lab for\nthis show is I said, sometimes\n\n47\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.470\nwe forget that there has to be something\nthat's entered in right at the beginning.\n\n48\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.368\nSo let's start off.\n\n49\n00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:51.050\nSo we're gonna add in two IPv6 addresses\nalong with our configuration here and then\n\n50\n00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.670\nwe'll just do a simple routing, a static\nroute to make sure we understand this.\n\n51\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480\nSo we're not really getting that much in\ndepth into it and there's a reason why.\n\n52\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.700\nIt's that in IPv6 you really don't need to\ndo a lot of static routing at all, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.550\nMost of the time,\n\n54\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.116\nby this point, you're probably only\nreally using dynamic routing protocols.\n\n55\n00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:12.170\nBut it is caught out, so\nwe are going to make sure\n\n56\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.520\nthat we configure this idea of\nthese routes as well, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.100\nSo we already configured the IP\naddresses on NYEDGE1, and on NYWAN1.\n\n58\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.861\nSo if I scroll over here,\nyou can actually see where\n\n59\n00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:30.867\nI was able to run a ping\nof an IPv6 address.\n\n60\n00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:32.278\nNo, actually not that one.\n\n61\n00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.290\nThat one's actually not the one\nthat I was able to run.\n\n62\n00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.810\nYeah, that's the one I was able to run,\n\n63\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.810\nand there's a reason why\nI can't do the other one,\n\n64\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.880\nbecause it's not actually in the routing\ntable for IPv6 on this NYWAN.\n\n65\n00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.430\nSo we're gonna have to get that over there\nbut let's go to NYEDGE1 is what we want to\n\n66\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.390\ndo, and let's go ahead and begin\nconfiguring here for IPv6 static routing.\n\n67\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.130\nRemember that when you want\nto do routing for IPv6,\n\n68\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.770\neven though you can enter in IP addresses,\nit’s not gonna be enabled by default.\n\n69\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.755\nIP version 4 routing is enabled,\nbut to enable IPv6 routing,\n\n70\n00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:14.381\nyou have to type in IPv6, and let me\nzoom in so that we can see that a little\n\n71\n00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:19.579\nbit better, unicast,\nwhich I can’t spell, -routing, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.260\nAnd that enables IPv6\nrouting on this router.\n\n73\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.060\nI've already done that over\non the NYWAN1 and NYEDGE1.\n\n74\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.370\nSo here, we're doing it for\nthis interface right here, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.160\nSo, once we have that set up and\nready to go, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.100\nThen we're gonna set up these\nother IP addresses on it.\n\n77\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.229\nI'm gonna start off with s1/0 too.\n\n78\n00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.824\nSo if i go ahead and\ntype in interface s/1/0, okay,\n\n79\n00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:55.942\nor serial 1/0,\nthen I can do ipv6 address, and\n\n80\n00:04:55.942 --> 00:05:02.550\nlet's do a question mark just\nin case we've forgotten this.\n\n81\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.490\nRemember that what we need to do is\nenter in the prefix that we want,\n\n82\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.520\nalong with, we want the host portion,\nyou can enter that in as well.\n\n83\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.400\nBut, for us, we're gonna just enter in a\nsimple address to help us out here, okay?\n\n84\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.092\nSo I'm gonna do 2000, or 2001: 0 : A,\n\n85\n00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:24.999\nand this one is gonna be : 2 here, : :,\n\n86\n00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:31.367\nthis gets me through the rest of\nthe address until the last bit of it,\n\n87\n00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:35.535\nwhich I believe I'm gonna make a 1, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:39.260\nThen just about everybody uses /64, so\n\n89\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.850\nit's gonna take that, and\nthen I'm gonna issue a no shutdown.\n\n90\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.720\nOkay, now we wanna configure the other\ninterface, which is gonna be interface\n\n91\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.980\ns or serial, let me spell it out this\ntime, 1/1, if I'm telling you wrong.\n\n92\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.596\nSo there it is, 1/1, and\n\n93\n00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:08.180\nthis is gonna have a 3 in it,\nthe ipv6 address.\n\n94\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.767\nDid I spell address right?\n\n95\n00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:16.250\nAddress [LAUGH] 2001: 0: A: 3.\n\n96\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.919\nAnd then this one also I think is a 1,\nif I remember, no, 2.\n\n97\n00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.710\nSo that's why having a diagram is nice.\n\n98\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.910\nWriting it down on paper\ninstead of me flipping back and\n\n99\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.970\nforth is probably nicer here but\nthis will also end up working as well.\n\n100\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.130\nNo shutdown, okay?\n\n101\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.050\nSo let's verify that these\nthings are working of course.\n\n102\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.200\nSo we're gonna ping.\n\n103\n00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:46.990\nAnd I'm just going to copy\nthis portion of the address.\n\n104\n00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:50.960\nAnd then let's see to the other side here.\n\n105\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.428\nAnd notice it actually did ping NYWAN1,\n\n106\n00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:55.465\nwhich is what I wanted it to.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n107\n00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:57.175\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm gonna use that again but\n\n108\n00:06:57.175 --> 00:07:00.160\njust change the numbers\naround a little bit.\n\n109\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.170\nMake that a 2, and\nmake that one a 2, and there we go.\n\n110\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.760\nNow I have successful verification\nthat I have connectivity on\n\n111\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.090\nNYEDGE2 pinging NYEDGE1\nas well as NYWAN1 so\n\n112\n00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.080\nI know I have good connectivity there.\n\n113\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.260\nSo, let's setup a static route.\n\n114\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.720\nSo the only thing that I haven't done,\nright?\n\n115\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.220\nSo let's do a show\n\n116\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.630\nipv6 route, okay?\n\n117\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.520\nNotice the routing table looks\n\n118\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.340\ndifferent here, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n119\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.928\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n120\n00:07:37.928 --> 00:07:43.077\non the routing table looking different,\nwhat I'm actually looking for, right?\n\n121\n00:07:43.077 --> 00:07:48.810\nIs actually the one where after\nthe a there's a 1 address and\n\n122\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:55.107\nnotice that I do not have anything\nin my table that has a 1 address,\n\n123\n00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:59.830\nright, so everything is A :2,\nand then A :3,\n\n124\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.890\nwhich is perfectly fine But\nI want to get to The network\n\n125\n00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:11.104\nthat is over here on the left-hand\nside of NYWAN1 and NYEDGE1.\n\n126\n00:08:11.104 --> 00:08:13.022\nSo this is the network I want to get to.\n\n127\n00:08:13.022 --> 00:08:17.170\nSo if I'm over here on NYEDGE2,\nI have two choices.\n\n128\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:22.720\nEither I'm gonna go up to NYEDGE1 and\nget there, or over to NYWAN1 and\n\n129\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.860\nget over there, so either way is\npossible in terms of static routing.\n\n130\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.580\nSo let's go ahead and configure this.\n\n131\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:36.355\nWithin the global configuration mode,\n\n132\n00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:39.078\nnow I need IPv6.\n\n133\n00:08:39.078 --> 00:08:41.984\nLet's see if it actually get us that,\nokay.\n\n134\n00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:46.522\nIPv6 route is what we're looking for,\nso remember that,\n\n135\n00:08:46.522 --> 00:08:48.530\nIPv6 route.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n136\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.086\nAnd then now it's saying hey,\nwhat's the address here?\n\n137\n00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:56.275\n2001 0:a:1, oops, and\n\n138\n00:08:56.275 --> 00:08:59.714\nthen I'm gonna do a :: and\n\n139\n00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:05.370\nI'm gonna tell it the network portion.\n\n140\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.200\nNotice I didn't add\nanything after the double\n\n141\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.020\ncolons.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n142\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm saying I wanna get to\n\n143\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.890\nthis network itself.\n\n144\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.160\nNow it's asking me,\nwhere do I want to send this?\n\n145\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.400\nSo what is gonna be the next top,\na is actually what we're looking for.\n\n146\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:27.068\nSo on this one here, which is going\nto be right here at the end, so\n\n147\n00:09:27.068 --> 00:09:32.323\nthis is going to be 2001 : a : 3 here and\n\n148\n00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:37.596\nnow I have to make sure it's 0.1 or :1.\n\n149\n00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:46.840\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at the routing table.\n\n150\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.639\nDo show IPv6 route.\n\n151\n00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:57.093\nOkay, now notice I have a route, and\n\n152\n00:09:57.093 --> 00:10:02.696\nthis is the one now that\nhas that 1 after the a,\n\n153\n00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:06.900\nso I have a : 1 a : 2 : a : 3.\n\n154\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.320\nThat's what I really wanted to have\n\n155\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.420\nhappen.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n156\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.553\n&gt;&gt; So now I should be able to get over\n\n157\n00:10:11.553 --> 00:10:12.982\nthere, or should I?\n\n158\n00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:18.780\nThat's the key.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n159\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.250\n&gt;&gt; So let's see here, so now if I ping,\n\n160\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.582\n2001 0 A : 1 :: 1.\n\n161\n00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:31.810\nOkay, notice I am able to do so, okay?\n\n162\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.570\nNow, remember you're probably saying,\n\n163\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.260\nwell, we didn't actually configure\nanything over on the other side.\n\n164\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.230\nBut remember it left what?\n\n165\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.341\nThis interface right here on NYEDGE2,\n\n166\n00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:48.220\nwhich means it was part of this network,\nright, a : 3, okay?\n\n167\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:53.150\nSo it went to NYWAN1, well guess what,\nNYWAN1 also has what, an interface in this\n\n168\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:11:00.340\nnetwork as well, and it could also look up\nthe address, and also get over here too.\n\n169\n00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.180\nSo that's why,\n\n170\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.060\nand then from here it knows how to\nactually get it back over here to answer.\n\n171\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.780\nSo that's why we didn't to set up\nthe other side if we didn't need to.\n\n172\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.350\nBut if we were to actually\ndo the same thing, okay,\n\n173\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.169\nsuch as creating an IPv6\nroute over on the other side,\n\n174\n00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:20.510\nwe would have to do the exact same\nthing we did in IP version 4.\n\n175\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.329\nThat would mean along the path here, we'd\nhad to make sure that we had a route and\n\n176\n00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:25.690\na route statement.\n\n177\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.320\nBut the only real difference is though,\nokay, cuz we're not spending a ton of time\n\n178\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.470\nbecause we don't normally\ndo a lot of IPV6 routing.\n\n179\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.790\nBut just to show you it\nworked the exact same\n\n180\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.960\nwith the exception of a little\nbit of syntax, right?\n\n181\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.060\nIPV6 is kind of the key here,\nonce we get something like that,\n\n182\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.950\nright, then it actually does\nend up working that way.\n\n183\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.310\nSo let's go ahead and\nset up what we talked about.\n\n184\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.928\nSo over on NYEDGE1, let's go ahead and\n\n185\n00:11:48.928 --> 00:11:53.403\ncreate a loop back to help us out here,\nand see what we can see, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:59.039\nSo over on NYEDGE1 let's do\nan interface loop back to zero,\n\n187\n00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:03.128\nand this time I'll do an IPv6 address, and\n\n188\n00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:06.773\nwe'll call this one 2001 0 a, and\n\n189\n00:12:06.773 --> 00:12:12.895\nthis time we'll actually do another\na here, just as an example.\n\n190\n00:12:12.895 --> 00:12:17.980\n::, at this point, and\n\n191\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.140\nwe'll make this one A1, again, and\n\n192\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.810\ndo a 64.\n\n193\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.530\nI forgot the word address.\n\n194\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.450\nI mean, who would've done that?\n\n195\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.405\nI'm the only one that would've done that,\nwouldn't I?\n\n196\n00:12:31.405 --> 00:12:32.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.590\n&gt;&gt; That's just what happens.\n\n198\n00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:42.460\nSo now that address is there,\nno shut down, okay?\n\n199\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:48.130\nSo with the no shut down, right,\nnow we have a loop back off of NYEDGE1,\n\n200\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.440\nand we want to be able to get\nthere from NYEDGE2, okay.\n\n201\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.800\nSo, in this sense,\n\n202\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.710\nif we wanted to do that, we would do the\nexact same thing here, along that pathway.\n\n203\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.520\nNow, I like working a little bit\nbackward to help us out here.\n\n204\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.635\nSo NYEDGE1, let me start here with NYWAN1.\n\n205\n00:13:09.858 --> 00:13:16.210\nShow IPv6 route, and\nverify that we have the connection here.\n\n206\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.206\nThe only connection that I don't have\nright here, right, is the A2, which is\n\n207\n00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:22.400\nfine we're not gonna worry about that one\nbecause, we all ready know how to do that.\n\n208\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.894\nBut let's go ahead and\nget to our other network here.\n\n209\n00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:34.059\nSo let me go into our\nglobal configuration mode,\n\n210\n00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:38.442\nthen from here IPv6 route\n\n211\n00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:43.819\n2001 0 a a ::/64, and\n\n212\n00:13:43.819 --> 00:13:48.797\nI'm gonna tell it to go up to,\n\n213\n00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:52.000\nwell, NYEDGE1.\n\n214\n00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.018\nOops, 0 a : and that was a 1 ::,\n\n215\n00:13:58.018 --> 00:14:04.053\nand let me verify, that's a .2.\n\n216\n00:14:09.332 --> 00:14:13.294\nAll right, so\nlet's see what we can do here.\n\n217\n00:14:16.115 --> 00:14:22.782\nPing 2001, 0:a,\n\n218\n00:14:22.782 --> 00:14:26.509\nlet's make sure that I can\nget up to the other interface\n\n219\n00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:30.520\nover here before I ping\nall the way out there.\n\n220\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.328\nNow I can hit the up arrow,\nand now I can do the a a.\n\n221\n00:14:34.328 --> 00:14:37.710\nAnd what do we configure a a with here?\n\n222\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.920\nWhich was actually a 1,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n223\n00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.328\nAnd I can figure that loop back as being,\nI can't remember, was it a 1 or 2?\n\n224\n00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:46.270\nIt was 1.\n\n225\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.120\nYeah, I got to remember,\nI never remember stuff that easily.\n\n226\n00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.740\nOkay, so notice I was now able to\nget to that point, which is fine,\n\n227\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.690\ncuz that means I've set up that router.\n\n228\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:03.990\nSo now, what I can do is I can do to\nNYEDGE2, which is not directly connected.\n\n229\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.510\nI can get in it over to this router, and\n\n230\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.670\nthis router can actually get\nit the rest of the way, okay.\n\n231\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.760\nSo, we'll see how it ends up working for\nus.\n\n232\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.152\nSo now, let's do the config terminal\n\n233\n00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:22.871\nto get in global configuration,\n\n234\n00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:28.939\nIPv6 route 2001: 0 a a ::/64,\n\n235\n00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:37.380\nand I know I'm supposed to\nactually go to the next top here.\n\n236\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.602\nGonna be a3 and then this was a,\nI always forget .1, or\n\n237\n00:15:44.602 --> 00:15:49.492\n:1, I'm gonna always forget that,\nno matter what.\n\n238\n00:15:53.077 --> 00:16:00.430\nDo show IPv6 route.\n\n239\n00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.698\nOkay, so let's see if I can verify.\n\n240\n00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:07.424\nSo I now have a static route right here,\nokay,\n\n241\n00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:10.780\nthat allows us to do that very same thing.\n\n242\n00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:14.790\nPing.\n\n243\n00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:20.944\nOops, 2001.\n\n244\n00:16:20.944 --> 00:16:24.150\nSo let's see if we're missing anything is\nwhat we're actually trying to do here.\n\n245\n00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:32.242\nA, and then 1.\n\n246\n00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:36.130\nLooks like we're actually\nhaving some issues, okay?\n\n247\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.770\nSo what in the world would\nthat issue actually be about,\n\n248\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.085\nunless I just typed it in wrong?\n\n249\n00:16:40.085 --> 00:16:44.750\nNow let's verify here,\nmake sure that I did the right thing.\n\n250\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.830\nA, A, there we go.\n\n251\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.288\nAnd it actually looks like, look at that.\n\n252\n00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:52.570\nWait, I did the wrong one there.\n\n253\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.710\nLet me go back to NYEDGE, okay?\n\n254\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.740\nSo it is not successful at this point.\n\n255\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.830\nSo if it's not successful,\n\n256\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.520\nwhat can I do to help me to figure out\nwhere something actually went wrong, okay?\n\n257\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.480\nWell, it's at this point we can kind\nof work backwards if we need to.\n\n258\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.380\nIf I start off, lets do it this way,\nokay, actually we can do it from here.\n\n259\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.610\nWhat if I issued a trace route?\n\n260\n00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:21.997\n2001:0a:a::1 and\n\n261\n00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:27.615\nlet's see what happens.\n\n262\n00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:34.674\nNotice that it actually does look like\nthat it got to a certain point and\n\n263\n00:17:34.674 --> 00:17:36.560\nthen it just kind of quit for us.\n\n264\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.470\nBut where it looks like it went to,\nthough, is it actually hit this router.\n\n265\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.270\nSo at this particular router,\n\n266\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.450\ngoing that direction, that is where we\nwould have to begin to troubleshoot and\n\n267\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.050\nfigure out why it's actually\nkind of breaking where it did.\n\n268\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.140\nSo it did hit this router so\n\n269\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.930\nwhatever the next hop was, which is\ngonna be up here at NYEDGE1, okay?\n\n270\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.144\nSo now we'll actually get to see and\ntroubleshoot from there.\n\n271\n00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:06.610\nSo here, I may have to do like\na Ctrl+C if it lets me out.\n\n272\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.566\nNow if it doesn't let you out you\ncan always do a Shift+Ctrl and\n\n273\n00:18:10.566 --> 00:18:12.364\nthe number 6 a lot of times.\n\n274\n00:18:12.364 --> 00:18:15.870\nAnd that normally helps break you\nout of some of this and wait.\n\n275\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.808\nSometimes you just have to wait for\nit to do what it does here, okay?\n\n276\n00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:25.290\nSo we're just gonna let it\ndo its thing right now and\n\n277\n00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.900\nwe'll hopefully end up\ntimeout after a while if not.\n\n278\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.201\nBut let's check out NYEDGE1 here,\n\n279\n00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:36.282\ndo show ipv6 route.\n\n280\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.290\nOkay, so let's take a look and\nsee what we're missing, okay?\n\n281\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.830\nI told it to go out of a:3, but\nlook at what I'm missing here.\n\n282\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.210\nI am actually not seeing what,\nan a:3, okay,\n\n283\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.600\nat all, so\nthis one is actually showing me that hey,\n\n284\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.210\nI don't have a path to go back and\nthat's why we're also getting that too.\n\n285\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:11.200\nSo on NYEDGE1 then, I should now be\nable to configure IPv6 route, okay?\n\n286\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.590\nNow were gonna have two choices, right,\n\n287\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.280\neither a default gateway, okay,\nor a gateway of last resort.\n\n288\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.090\nOr the idea of actually setting it up\nthe way that we are going to do it,\n\n289\n00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.070\nwhich is right here.\n\n290\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.092\nLet's give it just a direct\npath back instead.\n\n291\n00:19:28.594 --> 00:19:35.180\nThat's gonna be a3Network/64.\n\n292\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.463\nAnd this time I need to\nsend from there to NYWAN1.\n\n293\n00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:43.027\nWhich is gonna be\n\n294\n00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:47.612\n2000a:1:: I\n\n295\n00:19:47.612 --> 00:19:51.947\ngotta remember 2.\n\n296\n00:19:51.947 --> 00:19:54.306\nI never remember those addresses here.\n\n297\n00:19:59.368 --> 00:20:01.440\nSo apparently I set up\nthe wrong IP address.\n\n298\n00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.900\nHow's that, let's do a1.\n\n299\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.240\nThere we go.\n\n300\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.780\nSo I just had those numbers\nbackward apparently.\n\n301\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.690\nThat's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.250\nI was like, why is that working?\n\n303\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.280\n2 and 2, that doesn't work here.\n\n304\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.340\nSo now we've got another address.\n\n305\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.670\nLet's see if the other side has\nnow finished its thing, okay?\n\n306\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.037\nSo, look at that.\n\n307\n00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:26.005\nIt actually did end up finding it after,\nprobably when we set up that route\n\n308\n00:20:26.005 --> 00:20:29.400\neverything actually finally went through.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n309\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here and\n\n310\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.840\nsee what we can do now, all right?\n\n311\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.010\nNow, there we go okay?\n\n312\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.760\nSo it was some time in that,\nright, when it was determining it,\n\n313\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.550\nwhen we set up the proper\nrouting in between but\n\n314\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.180\nonce again it shows you the limitations\nof static routing, okay?\n\n315\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:52.070\nSo even though you might think of IPv6\nas scary cuz it changes everything,\n\n316\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.780\nit really doesn't.\n\n317\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.999\nIt's the same logic that\nwe were using with IPv4.\n\n318\n00:20:56.999 --> 00:21:01.100\nThe numbering looks a little bit\ndifferent, it is a little bit stranger to\n\n319\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.720\nhave to deal with but\nit's still the same functionality.\n\n320\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.104\nIt still helps us to do what\nwe need to as well, and\n\n321\n00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:11.198\njust making sure those configurations that\nwe correct are gonna be a big part of it.\n\n322\n00:21:11.198 --> 00:21:14.774\nBut realize that that's pretty\nmuch all what we end up dealing\n\n323\n00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.500\nwith in static routing\nthe majority of times.\n\n324\n00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.924\nSo get used to also typing in IPv6, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n325\n00:21:21.924 --> 00:21:23.490\n&gt;&gt; And doing that as well.\n\n326\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:30.090\nSo show ipv6 interface\nbrief is another one, okay?\n\n327\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.820\nIf you need to see the configuration\nof the interfaces on that.\n\n328\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:40.537\nRemember that it also creates its own link\nlocal address on that interface as well.\n\n329\n00:21:40.537 --> 00:21:47.729\nAnd then if you need to verify your IPv6\nroutes don't forget show ipv6 route and\n\n330\n00:21:47.729 --> 00:21:52.190\nthat will also bring up\nthe routing table for you.\n\n331\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.975\nIt's not as lengthy as what\nwe expect to see IPv4 but\n\n332\n00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:58.890\nit is actually doing the same job.\n\n333\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.071\nSo overall, Zach,\nthat's actually a good place,\n\n334\n00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:07.060\nwe've kinda of done just about everything\nthat we need to understand at this point\n\n335\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.168\nin using static routing in IPv6.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] static routing IPv6,\n\n336\n00:22:11.168 --> 00:22:12.608\ngreat episode, right?\n\n337\n00:22:12.608 --> 00:22:13.560\nDid a wonderful job.\n\n338\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.704\nAnd before we move along,\n\n339\n00:22:14.704 --> 00:22:17.680\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well once again practice\n\n340\n00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.890\nis the key, right?\n\n341\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.880\nSo at this point you need to\nbegin practicing if you haven't.\n\n342\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.554\n&gt;&gt; Practice, practice.\n\n343\n00:22:23.554 --> 00:22:26.110\n&gt;&gt; And it needs to be daily as well.\n\n344\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.850\nDon't forget,\nspeed is important at this point, right?\n\n345\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.370\nYou don't need to be going backwards and\nslowing down.\n\n346\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.010\nI know that that sounds strange, but\n\n347\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.400\nas you make mistakes,\nyou need to configure the work quicker.\n\n348\n00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.524\nAnd even if you have to do abbreviations,\nby now, though,\n\n349\n00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:47.397\nhopefully you've already memorized\nthe most basic commands fully, and\n\n350\n00:22:47.397 --> 00:22:51.098\nnow you can start using those\nabbreviations to help you to get faster.\n\n351\n00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:55.920\nBut don't just use abbreviations and not\nknow what the full command actually means.\n\n352\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.374\nSo continue to work as quickly as you can\nand understand it's functionality as well,\n\n353\n00:23:01.374 --> 00:23:05.780\nbut speed is a key as well as of\ncourse accuracy is tantamount.\n\n354\n00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.770\nBut if you don't have both of them,\nyou will not get through the exam.\n\n355\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.270\nSo make sure both, that you're practicing,\nbuild that muscle memory, and\n\n356\n00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.110\nit's gonna help you get through the exam.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, Ronnie.\n\n357\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.363\nCisco CCENT's a wonderful series.\n\n358\n00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:21.060\nMake sure you watch every episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n359\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.780\nAnd you'll be in the course library, too.\n\n360\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.090\nThere's thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n361\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.400\nhelp you go further.\n\n362\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.456\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n363\n00:23:29.456 --> 00:23:31.910\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n364\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.030\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n365\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.982\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n366\n00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:43.054\n[MUSIC]\n\n367\n00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:46.015\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.878\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.232\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:16.730\nwatching ITPro.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.510\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.480\nThis particular episode is we're gonna\nconfigure RIP version two for IPv4.\n\n8\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.256\nWow, that sounds cool.\n\n9\n00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:31.520\nAnd the person doing that for\nus is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.910\nRonnie, great to have you here, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.860\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non here in our journey through CCENT.\n\n12\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.930\nNow we are jumping in to\ndynamic routing protocols.\n\n13\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.440\nIf you've been watching it in the order\nin which we've been presenting it,\n\n14\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.670\nin terms of what you see on the website.\n\n15\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.920\nWe've gone through static routing,\nwhich is what we need do.\n\n16\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.190\nWe showed you how to configure it, and\n\n17\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.970\nwe've done a little bit\nmore configuration.\n\n18\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.251\nWe even showed you a basic\nidea of configuring RIP,\n\n19\n00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:00.553\nas well dynamic routing protocol.\n\n20\n00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:04.645\nBut now we're gonna jump in and we're\ngonna talk about some of the details that\n\n21\n00:01:04.645 --> 00:01:08.480\nyou need to know about RIP as you get\nready for the CCENT exam as well.\n\n22\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.404\nSo RIP was actually one of the dynamic\nrouting protocols that they got rid of in\n\n23\n00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.692\na previous iteration of this exam.\n\n24\n00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:19.913\nBut they've brought it back because it's\ngood protocol to begin to learn about\n\n25\n00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.840\ndynamic routing protocols.\n\n26\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.840\nAnd it's a good one to see how the routers\nactually do function and how they work.\n\n27\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.779\nWithout having really having to bring\nup a lot of extra stuff right here\n\n28\n00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.200\nat the entry level of\nworking with Cisco equipment.\n\n29\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.890\nSo that is what we're going to\nbe taking a look at, of course,\n\n30\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.950\nis really the idea of what it\ntakes to run RIP version 2.\n\n31\n00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.030\nAnd some of the different things that\nare a little bit quirky about it\n\n32\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.050\nthat you need to know about as well.\n\n33\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.195\nNow before we get started in there,\n\n34\n00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:51.774\nwe wanna make sure that we round out\nsome fundamental knowledge as well about\n\n35\n00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:54.867\nthe idea of dynamic routing protocols too,\nokay?\n\n36\n00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:58.498\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat my diagram here on the computer,\n\n37\n00:01:58.498 --> 00:02:01.580\nand this will help us out\nat the beginning, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.800\nSo I've got a lab topology here, I've\ngot five routers that are set up just so\n\n39\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.410\nthat we can see this.\n\n40\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.043\nBut when it comes down to\ndynamic of writing protocols,\n\n41\n00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:13.470\nremember that in static you and\nI have to configure all of it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.969\nBut in the idea of dynamic\nrouting protocols,\n\n43\n00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.270\nthe term dynamic means it adjusts for\nus and it actually does it automatically.\n\n44\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.730\n&gt;&gt; More flexible.\n\n45\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah more flexible, and\n\n46\n00:02:23.257 --> 00:02:26.220\nactually the idea of having it learn for\nus.\n\n47\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.963\nSo I don't have to tell it about every\nroute that I might want to be able\n\n48\n00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:30.553\nto get to.\n\n49\n00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:35.550\nIt can learn and it can pass that other\ninformation on to other routers as well.\n\n50\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.170\nNow when it comes down to dynamic routing\nprotocols, there's generically two types.\n\n51\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.590\nThere's what we call distance vector and\nthen there's also link state.\n\n52\n00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.925\nNow depending on who you talk to,\nyou may hear three types, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:51.702\nSo you may hear distance vector and\nthen you hear the term hybrid sometimes,\n\n54\n00:02:51.702 --> 00:02:53.541\nthen you hear the term Link-State.\n\n55\n00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.577\nBut when it comes down to it,\nCisco itself,\n\n56\n00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.901\nwhich developed the one\nthat people call hybrid.\n\n57\n00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.886\nThey like the terminology, but they admit\nthat it's really not a super hybrid as\n\n58\n00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:08.130\nmuch as it is in what's called an Advanced\nDistance Vector protocol as well, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.300\nSo when we start talking about this,\nlet's differentiate those to help us out.\n\n60\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.140\nIn distance vector protocol,\nlet's explain that term just for\n\n61\n00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.150\na moment to help us out, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.570\nSo when we break apart the term\ndistance vector, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.512\nWhat you get a sense of is this routing\nprotocol itself is based on an algorithm.\n\n64\n00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:32.127\nAnd an algorithm is just a simple series\nof ways that it calculates whatever it\n\n65\n00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:33.160\nwants to.\n\n66\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.490\nIt doesn't matter for you and I what\nthe mathematics actually is in doing it,\n\n67\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.460\nbut there's technical terms for it.\n\n68\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.135\nBut overall though at this point,\ndistance vector.\n\n69\n00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:46.839\nDistance means that it is about\nthe number of hops from the source,\n\n70\n00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.640\nfrom where you are, to the destination.\n\n71\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.560\nSo that's the idea of distance,\nthat's what it's gonna count.\n\n72\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.108\nThe other thing it is also\nabout is the term vector.\n\n73\n00:03:57.108 --> 00:04:03.280\nVector is giving us a direction to go in\nto arrive at the destination network.\n\n74\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.410\nSo in dynamic routing protocols,\nif it's a distance vector protocol,\n\n75\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.950\nthat means it bases itself off\nof the number of routers or\n\n76\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.200\nhops that you have to go through to\nget to its ultimate destination, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.560\nSo that's what it's talking about there,\nokay?\n\n78\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.840\nSo when you start taking a look at it\nhere, there's really four different ones.\n\n79\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.560\nAnd one of them I've put in here just for\nthe sake of completeness,\n\n80\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.400\nbut I will talk about these\ntwo in particular cuz\n\n81\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.010\nwe're actually spending\nour time in RIP version 2.\n\n82\n00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.690\nBut let's just describe them briefly\nhere and make sure that we understand.\n\n83\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.850\nIn terms of distance vector, let's start\nat the beginning here, which is IGRP.\n\n84\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.500\nSo Cisco developed their own distance\nvector protocol at the very beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.540\nAnd it worked, but it didn't work\nvery well is what it came down to.\n\n86\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.110\nSo then in the industry standard\nsources and other places.\n\n87\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.530\nThey came up with, well, RIP here,\nwhich is Routing Information Protocol.\n\n88\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.610\nAnd this worked a little bit better,\n\n89\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.870\nbecause of the way that it did its metric\nit actually did work a little bit better.\n\n90\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.996\nThe first version of RIP was developed\naround the idea of classful routing, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:17.309\nSo when you take a look at\nthat idea of RIP version 1,\n\n92\n00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.880\nthis is for classful routing.\n\n93\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.020\nNow remember what that actually means.\n\n94\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.440\nIf we go back into our\nnetworking fundamental.\n\n95\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.147\nClassful routing really only looked\nat the first octet to decide how it\n\n96\n00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:31.830\nwould route information.\n\n97\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.140\nSo it was based on\nthe idea of those classes,\n\n98\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.780\nclass A, class B, and class C addresses.\n\n99\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.739\nThat is as far as it went.\n\n100\n00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:42.650\nIt didn't care about\nthe subnet mask at all.\n\n101\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.590\nIt just said look, we're only\nlooking at the first octet there.\n\n102\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.970\nAnd based on the binary\nthat it knows about.\n\n103\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.160\nClass A for example,\nit begins all of them,\n\n104\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.530\nif you turn those addresses into binary,\nit begins with a 0.\n\n105\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.740\nClass B begins with a 10 in binary and\nthen class C is a 110.\n\n106\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.600\nSo that's all it cared about, and\nRIP version 1 was actually out there and\n\n107\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.960\nit actually did work in that sense.\n\n108\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.240\nBut if you tried to do\nany type of subnetting,\n\n109\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.367\nwhere you start changing the subnet masks,\nit didn't care.\n\n110\n00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:15.810\nIt didn't even look for it, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.553\nSo when subnetting got popular then,\nwell RIP version 2 came along and\n\n112\n00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:23.888\ngave us the idea here of\nalso being able to do this.\n\n113\n00:06:23.888 --> 00:06:27.857\nBut it actually did what we called\nauto-summarization as well,\n\n114\n00:06:27.857 --> 00:06:30.463\nand then it also did classless too, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:34.962\nSo it could support it, but\nit wasn't normally on by default, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:38.960\nSo RIP version 2 allowed\nus now to play around and\n\n117\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.690\ntake into account the subnet mask as well.\n\n118\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.660\nSo it could summarize up to the class.\n\n119\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.060\nSo even if you took a classful\naddress like 192.168.1,\n\n120\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.944\nand you used instead of the 24-bit subnet\nmask and used a 26-bit subnet mask.\n\n121\n00:06:56.944 --> 00:06:59.690\nYou'd be able to take all of\nthose smaller networks and\n\n122\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.255\nsummarize them up to the classful\nnetwork that it needed to be.\n\n123\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:04.315\nSo it did that, but\n\n124\n00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:08.370\nit did it automatically as well,\nso that way it would work too.\n\n125\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.892\nNow because Cisco wanted to actually,\nof course, have their own protocols,\n\n126\n00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:15.231\nthey were running their own equipment.\n\n127\n00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.860\nIt did support RIP,\nit did support IGRP here.\n\n128\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.110\nBut today you might not even see on\nCisco equipment IGRP being supported.\n\n129\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.770\nBut they did actually end up\nwith a better protocol, and\n\n130\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.510\na very sophisticated protocol,\nthat they called EIGRP.\n\n131\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.530\nWhich is\nEnhanced Interior Gateway Protocol,\n\n132\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.840\nthe original is Interior Gateway Protocol\nis what that one is.\n\n133\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.730\nAnd this is called\nan advanced distance vector.\n\n134\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.370\nSo instead of just relying\non hop count here,\n\n135\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.200\nEIGRP did actually a couple\nof different things.\n\n136\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.639\nWhich it actually added in the idea\nhere of basing the very beginning of\n\n137\n00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.907\nthe routing table off of hop count.\n\n138\n00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.855\nBut then it added in what\nwe call bandwidth and\n\n139\n00:07:56.855 --> 00:08:01.442\ndelay to help us out to form a better\npicture of the network too, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:06.898\nSo those are kind of the distance vector\ntypes of protocols as well, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:06.898 --> 00:08:09.234\nNow, the other general category for\n\n142\n00:08:09.234 --> 00:08:13.314\nwhat we're talking about here\nis what we call link statements.\n\n143\n00:08:13.314 --> 00:08:17.060\nNow I do need to mention something\nthat I didn't think about here, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.130\nAll of these that are listed under here\nare actually under a general category\n\n145\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.290\ncalled IGP, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.860\nWhich is interior,\nif I can spell interior.\n\n147\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.694\nInterior gateway protocols.\n\n148\n00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:34.770\nOkay?\n\n149\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.936\nIGPs and what does that actually mean?\n\n150\n00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:42.382\nThat means that these are the types\nof routing protocols that you and\n\n151\n00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:47.297\nI will end up actually using within\nour own administrative domain, okay,\n\n152\n00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:50.980\nis what that actually means or\nadministrative system.\n\n153\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.510\nSo in other words, if I'm responsible for\n\n154\n00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.910\nthat entire network in choosing\nthe protocol that I'm going to run,\n\n155\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.610\nthen it's probably going to be\none of these that's listed here.\n\n156\n00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.200\nBut distance vector, it did work.\n\n157\n00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.970\nBut usually it works better for\nsmaller networks too, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.550\nSo you could do that.\n\n159\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.629\nBut EIGRP though,\n\n160\n00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:14.021\nit actually works very well with large\nnetworks if you want to as well, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:17.540\nBut even though it actually isn't\nan advance distance vector,\n\n162\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.049\nthat's how Cisco also lists it as well,\nwhich is distance vector as well, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:22.049 --> 00:09:23.940\nSo might see the term hybrid.\n\n164\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.800\nAnd telling you this for\nthe sake of the exam.\n\n165\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.840\nIf you see something like, for\n\n166\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.400\nexample like, which of the following\nis a distance vector protocol?\n\n167\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.990\nAnd they list these all together and they\ndon't give you a hybrid or they don't give\n\n168\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:40.850\nyou advance distance vector, I would list\nEIGRP as a distance vector protocol, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.770\nBut if they do give you something\nmore specific such as they tell,\n\n170\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.750\nyou is it an advance distance vector?\n\n171\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.940\nWell choose that one instead, or this\nhybrid, choose that one as well, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.116\nAlright so, there's also what we\ncall link-state protocols, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:57.570\nThere's two link-state protocols.\n\n174\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.230\nOne of them we don't tend to\nsee implemented very often.\n\n175\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.824\nIn the 90s, 80s or so when you did,\nwhich is called ISIS intermediate\n\n176\n00:10:05.824 --> 00:10:09.470\nsystem to intermediate system\nis what that one stood for.\n\n177\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.830\nThis is Cisco proprietary, and\nthis particular routing protocol did not\n\n178\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.410\nactually say look,\nit's about hop count here, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.290\nWhat it actually says is kind of weird.\n\n180\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.615\nLink-state.\n\n181\n00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:23.040\nSo let's break that down\na little more too, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.200\nSo the idea of link-state is,\nlet's take router one for example, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.577\nRouter one said look,\n\n184\n00:10:28.577 --> 00:10:33.795\nwe're gonna base this routing protocol off\nof whatever algorithms that we also use,\n\n185\n00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:37.502\nbut it also actually takes\nthe idea here of link-state too.\n\n186\n00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:43.009\nAnd that means each interface can report\nwhat is directly connected to it and\n\n187\n00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:46.632\nwhether or\nnot that's actually a good path to go.\n\n188\n00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:50.577\nSo essentially these link-state protocols,\nokay,\n\n189\n00:10:50.577 --> 00:10:55.888\nas an easy analogy for me to use and\nactually, Zach may be younger than me so\n\n190\n00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:58.960\nlet's do that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I doubt that very seriously.\n\n191\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.410\n&gt;&gt; All right so Zach,\n\n192\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.090\nlet's just kinda play here for a moment.\n\n193\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.190\nThe very fact is link-state protocols,\nthey work like a road atlas.\n\n194\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.097\nNow there might be people actually,\nyou know watching us, they're like,\n\n195\n00:11:11.097 --> 00:11:12.631\nwhat the heck is a road atlas?\n\n196\n00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:16.119\nThere used to be an actual book of maps,\nright, that you could buy, and\n\n197\n00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:18.372\nthen you'd have to follow them.\n&gt;&gt; Great big ones too.\n\n198\n00:11:18.372 --> 00:11:19.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great big one, and for\n\n199\n00:11:19.797 --> 00:11:22.077\nme, I'd buy one for\nthe entire United States,\n\n200\n00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:22.790\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n201\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.095\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you think about it,\n\n202\n00:11:24.095 --> 00:11:26.140\nlink-state works the same way.\n\n203\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.060\nWhat it tries to do within that autonomous\nsystem, all of the routers that\n\n204\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.430\nyou're responsible, regardless of how many\nthere are, five, 50, whatever it might be,\n\n205\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:43.520\nit says, I need a map of every section\nof the entire autonomous system.\n\n206\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.115\nThen it puts it together into\nthat atlas is what it does.\n\n207\n00:11:47.115 --> 00:11:47.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n208\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.070\nFrom there, it takes a look, when Zach\nsays, hey, we're here in Florida.\n\n209\n00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.034\nWe want to go to New York for\nexample, right?\n\n210\n00:11:57.034 --> 00:12:00.587\nSo regardless of where you are in\nthe world, let's say that's what we did.\n\n211\n00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:05.101\nWhat Zach does is he sends you all\na copy of that link-state, and then you\n\n212\n00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:10.059\nactually determine your best path to get\nto New York City from wherever you are,\n\n213\n00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:13.870\nand Zach does the same thing,\nand I do the same thing.\n\n214\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.930\nWe might find out something.\n\n215\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.750\nYou might have another path\nthat gets you there faster.\n\n216\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.639\nI might have a path that\ngets me there faster.\n\n217\n00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.100\nZach has his own path.\n\n218\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.180\nBut using the same exact\npath is not gonna work.\n\n219\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.718\nSo link-state helps us to build\nessentially that entire atlas and\n\n220\n00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:34.159\nthen to choose from that which ones are\nthe best ones that are available, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.795\nSo that's what this one does.\n\n222\n00:12:35.795 --> 00:12:39.155\nNow when you compare that\nidea with EIGRP here,\n\n223\n00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:44.531\nEIGRP kind of does something similar\nin that it builds this initial topology\n\n224\n00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:50.360\nusing the idea of distance vector, but\nthen it also says look, let's do this.\n\n225\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.430\nLet me not only keep the idea of this,\nbut let me go ahead and\n\n226\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.700\nsay this is the best route, but\nlet me also keep the second best route,\n\n227\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.280\njust in case the first best route\nturns out to not be good anymore.\n\n228\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.520\nI don't wanna recalculate.\n\n229\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.440\nI don't wanna rerun the algorithm.\n\n230\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.790\nI'll just choose the next one\nthat's available there, and\n\n231\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.450\nit makes it very fast as well, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.440\nThe neat thing about all of these is that\nthey are very sophisticated protocols\n\n233\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.710\nhere, okay, when you actually see them.\n\n234\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.830\nBut those are dynamic routing protocols.\n\n235\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.740\nFor you and me, at least in today,\nand what we'll be learning on CCEP,\n\n236\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.700\nwe're gonna be spending time\nhere in RIP version two\n\n237\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.620\nis what we're gonna be spending time in.\n\n238\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.465\nAnd that's what we want to\nunderstand as well, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:35.149\nBecause this is actually very typical\nof us understanding how the routing\n\n240\n00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:36.282\ntable is built and\n\n241\n00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:41.380\nalso seeing some of the different\nthings that we might not think about.\n\n242\n00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.042\nSo, let's kind of take a look\nhere just as an example, right?\n\n243\n00:13:45.042 --> 00:13:47.669\nSo if you and I were to choose\na distance vector protocol,\n\n244\n00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:50.790\nit doesn't matter which one\nthat we choose at this point.\n\n245\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.630\nEIGRP is kind of the one\nthat's left out here.\n\n246\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.120\nWe'll just say RIP and EIGRP here, okay?\n\n247\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.866\nIf you choose any of that, now Zach,\nif we're over here on router one, and\n\n248\n00:14:01.866 --> 00:14:05.950\nwe wanna go to Network A over\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n249\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.850\nwhat RIP does is it says it's\nonly a matter of hop count, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:15.485\nAnd that means, how many routers does it\ntake to get from router one to Network A?\n\n251\n00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:18.490\nOver there on the left-hand side of router\none if you want to be technical about it,\n\n252\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.840\nbut it's pretty much router one.\n\n253\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.970\nSo if I do something like that, what it\nsays is, look, the lower number of hops,\n\n254\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.905\nin other words, the less number of hops,\nthe better the route is.\n\n255\n00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:30.508\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n256\n00:14:30.508 --> 00:14:33.147\n&gt;&gt; So at this point, we have two possible\n\n257\n00:14:33.147 --> 00:14:38.710\npaths, down this path over here or\nup here and going around this way.\n\n258\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.370\nIn a distance vector protocol,\nwhen it counts, it leaves here, so\n\n259\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.840\nthe top one would be one, and then two,\nand then I'm on Network A, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.407\nSo that would be two.\n\n261\n00:14:50.407 --> 00:14:56.775\nIf we go across the bottom one as it\ndoes this, we actually leave router one,\n\n262\n00:14:56.775 --> 00:15:01.440\none, two, and\nthree before I get to Network A.\n\n263\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.718\nIf we're running RIP on router one,\n\n264\n00:15:03.718 --> 00:15:07.980\nit says the lowest number of hops in\nbetween, you know when we see it,\n\n265\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.756\neven though there is multiple paths that\nare available to get me to Network A,\n\n266\n00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:16.673\nit would chose the one with the less\nnumber of hops to get there.\n\n267\n00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:21.329\nNow, what it doesn't take into account,\nwhat RIP doesn't take into account is\n\n268\n00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:25.080\nnotice the link speeds that\nwe see in between them.\n\n269\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.511\nSo the bottom path, even though there\nare more hops in between me and\n\n270\n00:15:30.511 --> 00:15:35.583\nNetwork A, it is a faster connection,\nokay, as well, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:40.290\nEach time about almost four times faster\nevery single hop along the way it\n\n272\n00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.940\nis better.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n273\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.240\n&gt;&gt; But RIP doesn't care.\n\n274\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.280\nRIP says nope,\nthere's only two hops this way, so\n\n275\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.420\nall the traffic coming into router\none trying to go to Network A,\n\n276\n00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.095\nit will always take the path from router\none, to two, to five to get there.\n\n277\n00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:56.008\nMm-hm,mm-hm.\n\n278\n00:15:56.008 --> 00:15:59.517\nIt doesn't care anything about\nthe fact that this is better for us.\n\n279\n00:15:59.517 --> 00:16:04.814\nOkay, now, [COUGH] once you actually\nkinda realize that and decide that.\n\n280\n00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:07.901\nWell, then you kinda\nrealize that that's fine,\n\n281\n00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:10.700\nas long as you know that\nthat is in existence.\n\n282\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.430\nSo if you go, no, that's the way\nI want it to go, that's fine.\n\n283\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.120\nYou can do something like that.\n\n284\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.340\nBut if you didn't know that, you would\nabsolutely choose to actually take\n\n285\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.400\nthis way that gets you where\nyou want to go instead.\n\n286\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.340\nLink state, though, it can take\na combination of different things.\n\n287\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.290\nBut let's just take the idea here of OSPF,\nfor example, as well, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.970\nOSPF actually says, look, let's take\ninto consideration here bandwidth.\n\n289\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.830\nAnd it begins with a reference bandwidth,\nand\n\n290\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.752\nit assigns a number to\nit based off of MAC.\n\n291\n00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:44.800\nWe're gonna get into that in\nthe CCNA routing and switching, but\n\n292\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.420\nat this point, let's just say that each\none of these is now assigned a number of,\n\n293\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.440\nlet's say like 19, for example, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.800\nWell, then when you actually do that,\n\n295\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.570\nlet's say that 256 is actually assigned\na number of something like 56, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.060\nWell, now what you do is let's say\nthat on this way going around,\n\n297\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.230\nlike with OSPF, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.610\nIf I go from router one to router two\nto router five, each one is 56 here, so\n\n299\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:12.850\nthat would be 112 to get over to\nNetwork A, just as an example.\n\n300\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:18.045\nBut down here at the bottom, each one's\n19, so that's 38 plus 19, which is gonna\n\n301\n00:17:18.045 --> 00:17:20.400\nbe something with a 7 at the end there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.530\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, okay.\n\n303\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.021\nSo there you go, so 19, 19, that's 38.\n\n304\n00:17:25.021 --> 00:17:29.740\n38 plus 19 is 57,\nsomewhere around there, I don't know.\n\n305\n00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.110\nBut it's a lower number.\n\n306\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.730\nSo with OSPF, right,\nthat is where we actually end up getting,\n\n307\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.560\nokay, a faster path to go through, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.910\nSo we'll get into OSPF as well, and\n\n309\n00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.480\nwe'll get into EIGRP in the CCNA\nrouting and switching show, but for\n\n310\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.630\nwhat we're going to do right now, we're\nactually gonna go into RIP itself, too.\n\n311\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.760\nNow, I'm talking a lot because there's\na lot of kind of fundamental details I've\n\n312\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.714\ngot to get to, and then we'll show you how\nthis works in our lab when we get to it.\n\n313\n00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:04.510\nSo there may end up being a part 2 to\nthis particular episode as well, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.530\nNow, how does it begin?\n\n315\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.570\nWell, let me set it up this way instead,\nokay?\n\n316\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.910\nSo right here,\n\n317\n00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.970\nhere's what I want you to understand\nalso about the way that RIP works.\n\n318\n00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.510\nWhen RIP works, it actually\ncalls it routing by rumor, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.730\nThat's how this one actually\nends up working here, okay?\n\n320\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.090\nSo let's just use router 1,\nrouter 2 for right now, and\n\n321\n00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.510\nthen we'll get to router 3 here in\na moment that's behind my head, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:33.500\nBut when it begins here with router 1 and\nwe turn RIP on,\n\n323\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.310\nit will automatically learn about the\nnetworks that it is directly connected to.\n\n324\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.352\nSo what it puts into its routing\ntable right away, right,\n\n325\n00:18:41.352 --> 00:18:42.727\nis the network over here.\n\n326\n00:18:42.727 --> 00:18:47.744\nThat's off of g0/0, 192.168.16.1.\n\n327\n00:18:47.744 --> 00:18:51.501\nIt enters it in because it is\ndirectly connected as well and\n\n328\n00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:53.503\ndoesn't have to go anywhere.\n\n329\n00:18:53.503 --> 00:18:57.140\nIts metric is gonna be a 0, and\nit actually says it's off this interface,\n\n330\n00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.660\nwhich is the one here to the left.\n\n331\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.060\nNotice the second one that it knows about.\n\n332\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.840\nIt's the same way.\n\n333\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.921\nIt says, hey, that 12 network, right?\n\n334\n00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:09.057\n192.168.12.1, or the 12 network,\n\n335\n00:19:09.057 --> 00:19:14.610\nis off of the one to the right over here,\nwhich is g0/1, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.130\nNow when that is actually true,\nit enters that in.\n\n337\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.460\nNow the problem that we have is simple.\n\n338\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.446\nNow we have to get the information about\nother networks that it needs to get to.\n\n339\n00:19:26.446 --> 00:19:28.407\nNow how does that actually end up working,\n\n340\n00:19:28.407 --> 00:19:31.120\nthat's what we want to also figure out,\ntoo.\n\n341\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.447\nSo we want to actually be able to learn\nabout the route over here between\n\n342\n00:19:36.447 --> 00:19:41.614\nrouter 2 and router 3,\nwhich is the 172.23.16.23.\n\n343\n00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:44.579\nAnd also the 200.200.200 network,\n\n344\n00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:48.320\nI wanna learn about that\ninformation as well, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.900\nSo if I have RIP turned on, this is what\nwill also begin to happen, too, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.030\nSo now we have to go over to router 3,\n\n347\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.530\ncuz you kinda get the idea\nrouter 2 is the same thing.\n\n348\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.190\nIt knows about the networks that\nit's directly connected to, and so\n\n349\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.081\ndoes router 3.\n\n350\n00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:08.290\nWell, let's start here with router\n3 to kind of help us along, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.350\nSo, when we start doing this,\nover here on router 3,\n\n352\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.300\nwe kind of have to take a look at\nthe network behind my head here, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.130\nI just put X's to give us space\nto be a place holder, right?\n\n354\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.920\nSo router 3 knows about\nthese two networks.\n\n355\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.600\nWell, what begins to happen here, right,\nbetween these routers is once we turn on\n\n356\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.960\nRIP, they being to communicate with\neach other about what they know about.\n\n357\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.620\nSo let's say router 3 says, hey,\nI've got these networks, and\n\n358\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.460\nnow it actually hears\nan update from router 2.\n\n359\n00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.748\nRouter 2 says, hey, I have\ninformation that I can share as well.\n\n360\n00:20:43.748 --> 00:20:47.281\nSo router 3 and\nrouter 2 begin to update, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:47.281 --> 00:20:50.121\nSo when it does that, notice down here,\n\n362\n00:20:50.121 --> 00:20:53.560\nfull routing table\nupdates every 30 seconds.\n\n363\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.034\nSo now router 2 sends a copy\nover to router 3, okay,\n\n364\n00:20:57.034 --> 00:21:01.020\nof its entire routing table,\nand this is how it begins.\n\n365\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:08.321\nSo, from router 2 it\nlearns about 172.16.23.0.\n\n366\n00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:16.222\n172.16.23.0/24, if I can\nactually type it out there, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:16.222 --> 00:21:19.430\nNow, once we take a look at that,\n\n368\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:24.110\nright, it is now saying, all right,\nhow did I get that, okay?\n\n369\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:29.040\nWith that routing table now being\nreported, router 3 here says,\n\n370\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.370\nhey, I am one hop away from router 2.\n\n371\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:39.000\nSo its metric, then,\nit'll actually be a 1, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.870\nSo there it is, router 1 got its update\nfrom router 2, which is one hop away.\n\n373\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.870\nHere's the one hop, and\nit updated its table.\n\n374\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.020\nNow the other side, though,\nit'd do the same thing, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:58.880\nSo it will again go 192.168.12.0 as well.\n\n376\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.010\nAnd the same process here, it learned\nit from router 2's update, oops.\n\n377\n00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.650\nSo it will also be one hop away as well,\nokay?\n\n378\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.820\nNow on or about the same time,\ndepending on it.\n\n379\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.729\nNow I can't do it simultaneously here,\nwhich is the problem, right?\n\n380\n00:22:16.729 --> 00:22:20.575\nSo router 2 and router 3 could\nhave updated simultaneously here,\n\n381\n00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:23.630\nokay, is what could have happened.\n\n382\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.480\nNow, but let's just take it in order here.\n\n383\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.290\nLet's just say that they're\na little bit off, right?\n\n384\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.830\nSo router 2 got its update just\na little bit later from router 3.\n\n385\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.925\nSo now router 2 wants to know\nabout the 200 network over there.\n\n386\n00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:44.877\nSo it can actually do 200.200.200 here,\n\n387\n00:22:44.877 --> 00:22:47.003\n.0/24.\n\n388\n00:22:47.003 --> 00:22:49.730\nLet me see if I can extend\nthat out to make that fit.\n\n389\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.670\nAnd this time it is actually one hop away,\nbut\n\n390\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:00.650\nit learned it from out of that interface,\nwhich is over here on the right-hand side.\n\n391\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.330\nOoh, I need to stretch that one\nout a little bit more [COUGH].\n\n392\n00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.460\nSo it'll learn this one.\n\n393\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.390\nNow, router 2 says, look,\nI'm still missing something.\n\n394\n00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.730\nSo now it could have been that router\n1 and router 2 started doing what?\n\n395\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.836\nStarted receiving updates as well.\n\n396\n00:23:16.836 --> 00:23:20.720\nSo let's say that router 1 by this\ntime had also sent its update.\n\n397\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.711\nIt compares, and it knows,\nand router 2 says, well,\n\n398\n00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:28.184\nI'm missing the route that I'm not\nconnected to, which 192.168.16.\n\n399\n00:23:30.738 --> 00:23:36.870\n192.168.16.0/24.\n\n400\n00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.370\nAnd that is one hop away.\n\n401\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.780\nAnd now we have that routing\ntable that's filled up.\n\n402\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:48.830\nRouter 2 now sends its routing table over,\nand it matches,\n\n403\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.470\nand it compares, and it sees that it has\ntwo routes that are the same, right?\n\n404\n00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.140\nThe 12 and the 16,\nthey're already in here.\n\n405\n00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.915\nWhen it compares and it goes,\nall right, so I need the 172, oops.\n\n406\n00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:04.671\n172.16.\n\n407\n00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:11.250\n23.0/24, and this metric,\nit learned it from Router 2 here.\n\n408\n00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:15.970\nMake sure I'm doing that right, yep.\n\n409\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.960\nIt learned it from Router 2,\nwhich is one hop away, and\n\n410\n00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.780\nit learned it off of that interface too.\n\n411\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:28.195\nNow, we have one more though,\nwhich is this 200.200.200.0 network.\n\n412\n00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:35.437\nSo Router 1 learns about that as well,\nsays 200.200.200.0/24,\n\n413\n00:24:35.437 --> 00:24:39.520\nthat's what I heard from\nRouter 2 that it did.\n\n414\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.790\nNow here's where it gets interesting,\nright?\n\n415\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:47.330\nThe metric though is not a one hop\nbecause it learned it from Router 2.\n\n416\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.810\nBut look at what Router 2 said to it.\n\n417\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:55.612\nIt said that, I am one hop away, so\nthe routing update in Router 1 says,\n\n418\n00:24:55.612 --> 00:24:58.860\nwell it says it's one hop away, right?\n\n419\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:03.248\nThe update that I got from Router 2, and\n\n420\n00:25:03.248 --> 00:25:08.280\nI am one hop away from Router 2,\nso I must be two\n\n421\n00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:14.762\nhops away from the 200.200.200.0 network.\n\n422\n00:25:14.762 --> 00:25:18.910\nSo now you see where\nthe routing table gets updated.\n\n423\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.030\nAnd when it does this, and\neverything is actually fine and stable and\n\n424\n00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.730\neverything is up to date, right?\n\n425\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.620\nEvery 30 seconds it will exchange\nthis at some point in time, right?\n\n426\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.780\nEach one of them, they don't have to\nalways be synchronized up in that way.\n\n427\n00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.710\nBut as they start learning about it,\nthis is what will end up happening.\n\n428\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:40.448\nNow when every single router in\nyour administrative system, now,\n\n429\n00:25:40.448 --> 00:25:45.267\nyour AS, your administrative system here,\nwhen they are all having\n\n430\n00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:50.023\nthe same identical routing table,\nyou are what we call converged.\n\n431\n00:25:50.023 --> 00:25:52.438\nOr you're in that state of convergence.\n\n432\n00:25:52.438 --> 00:25:57.820\nWhich means that the entirety of those\nrouting tables are essentially matching.\n\n433\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.940\nI can get to every other\nnetwork that I need to get to\n\n434\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.900\nusing the information that I'm giving it.\n\n435\n00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.640\nIf something changes, the nice thing\nabout dynamic routing protocol,\n\n436\n00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.160\nZach, is that it will also\nchange along with it too.\n\n437\n00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.610\nBut with distance vector protocols though,\n\n438\n00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:19.190\nyou have to be careful because there are\nthings that can actually kind of get you.\n\n439\n00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.310\nWhich essentially are routing loops and\nother things like\n\n440\n00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:26.820\ndiscontiguous networks that we need\nto also address as well, okay?\n\n441\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.360\nSo we'll be addressing some\nof that too as we come back.\n\n442\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.670\nBut just kind of get at least into\nyour mind at this point, right?\n\n443\n00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:37.710\nYou now understand a little bit more\nabout dynamic rounding protocols, and\n\n444\n00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.660\nwhat they do for us.\n\n445\n00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.700\nAnd you're now seeing that\nbeginning with that lease rip here,\n\n446\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.410\nhow the round tables\nare beginning to populate.\n\n447\n00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.950\nSo now that we've got some light on it,\nwe still are ready to talk\n\n448\n00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.700\nabout it a little bit more, and\nthen we've gotta jump into our lab so\n\n449\n00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.340\nthat we can show you how some of this\nstuff actually ends up working here.\n\n450\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.370\nBut Zach, at this point,\nthis is a good place for us to stop.\n\n451\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.030\nAs I look over,\nI see that I'm running out of time here.\n\n452\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.170\nSo we'll pick up with just a little bit\nmore lecture, I hate to call it that.\n\n453\n00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.250\nBut that's exactly what it is, we'll\ndiscuss a little bit more in terms of\n\n454\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.960\nunderstanding this, and then we'll jump\ninto our lab to show us the configuration\n\n455\n00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.690\nthat we need to see here.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for\n\n456\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.432\neverything, Ronnie,\nyou're doing a great job.\n\n457\n00:27:19.432 --> 00:27:24.120\nConfigure RIPv2 for\nIPv4 part two is coming up, and\n\n458\n00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.350\nthank you for watching part one.\n\n459\n00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.510\nAnything else you'd like\nto say before we move on?\n\n460\n00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.296\nWell, just remember, at this point\nunderstanding that topic,just the idea\n\n461\n00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:35.341\nbetween what a routing\nprotocol actually is, and\n\n462\n00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:38.169\nat least what we're setting up right now,\nand\n\n463\n00:27:38.169 --> 00:27:43.049\njust that basic idea of how that routing\ntable fills up is going to be important.\n\n464\n00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:46.660\nBecause we'll see it again,\nespecially when we get ready for the exam.\n\n465\n00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.810\nTo just realize the steps that\nwe took to explain this to and\n\n466\n00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.110\nwe still got a couple more\ntopics that we need to cover,\n\n467\n00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.710\nthen we'll jump right into our lab.\n&gt;&gt; Can't wait until we do.\n\n468\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.200\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of Cisco CCent Ronnie's put\n\n469\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.080\ntogether for you.\n\n470\n00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.890\nYou'll be glad you did and while you're in\nthat course library there's thousands of\n\n471\n00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.530\nother videos too by the way.\n\n472\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.510\nAnd they're there to help you go further.\n\n473\n00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.540\nTell everybody you know about IT ProTV,\nIT ProTV is binge worthy.\n\n474\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.270\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n475\n00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.116\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n476\n00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:15.364\nwe're gonna see you again real soon.\n\n477\n00:28:15.364 --> 00:28:22.199\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:28:22.199 --> 00:28:25.416\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.837\nwatching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again.\n\n4\n00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:16.890\nThanks for watching ITPro.TV\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.000\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco C set.\n\n6\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.030\nWe're gonna configure RIP version 2 for\nIPv4.\n\n7\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.120\nThis is part two so\nmake sure you pay attention.\n\n8\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.680\nAnd the person to bring us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n9\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.580\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.280\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.190\nhaving me back on the show\nas we continue on.\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.110\nAnd taking a look at the idea of\nthe dynamic routing protocol that we're\n\n13\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.290\ntalking about, which is gonna be RIP,\nand specifically RIP version two.\n\n14\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.100\nIn our previous episode\nwe were talking about,\n\n15\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.161\nof course,\nhow the routing table was built.\n\n16\n00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:51.340\nAnd of course just some generic concepts\nthat helped us to differentiate\n\n17\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.270\nwhat RIP was, whether it was routing or\nthe idea here of a distance\n\n18\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.440\nvector protocol verses link state\nprotocol, we kinda defined that briefly.\n\n19\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.019\nOkay, let's go back to our diagram,\nwe'll jump right in here.\n\n20\n00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.412\nBecause there's a couple of mistakes that\nI made that I just realized right in\n\n21\n00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:07.345\nbetween as we were cutting from-\n&gt;&gt; This is live\n\n22\n00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:08.300\n[CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n23\n00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.880\nThis is what ends up happening.\n\n24\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.582\nSo, we're gonna have to take a look just\nright behind my head over here on router 3\n\n25\n00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:15.030\nas I begin to build this.\n\n26\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.440\nI didn't realized that I had typed\nin two different networks here.\n\n27\n00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.980\nSo, previously I had actually\ntyped in 172.16.23 twice.\n\n28\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.670\nUp here is what I did and\nI also left off the 16 network.\n\n29\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.730\nBut I've corrected that now and\nI'll try and make sure I put that into\n\n30\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.370\nthe show notes for episode one,\nthat I did mistype that overall.\n\n31\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.360\nBut here,\nyou're seeing the 12 network, right.\n\n32\n00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.630\nRemember that's one hop away.\n\n33\n00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.670\nSo I corrected this entry.\n\n34\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.360\nAnd in the second one,\nwhich I left off completely,\n\n35\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.170\nI don't know why I did so, but I did.\n\n36\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.920\nI added that in there and now that's\nover on the left hand side of router 1.\n\n37\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.750\nSo remember that that's actually gonna be\nwhere router 2 reported that as being one\n\n38\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.010\nhop away.\n\n39\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.600\nRouter 3 says I'm one\nhop away from router 2.\n\n40\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.890\nSo if I do that one hop and\n\n41\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.120\none hop here, that actually\ngives us that metric of 2, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.080\nSo we're just leave this up just for\na brief second when we did that, right?\n\n43\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.730\nAnd this will help you, okay, cuz if\nyou're looking at it from last episode and\n\n44\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.160\nyou're like, hey, that wasn't right.\n\n45\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.660\nYou're correct, it wasn't.\n\n46\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.520\nBut this will get it right for us here.\n\n47\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.110\nSo here is what we have, right.\n\n48\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.010\nIs that this particular network is\nnow what we call converged at this\n\n49\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.030\npoint, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.130\nSo even as they continue to exchange\nrouting table updates every 30 seconds,\n\n51\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.080\nif nothing else changes here, they're just\ngonna compare and it's gonna say, okay,\n\n52\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.520\nthere's no other updates.\n\n53\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.120\nBut if you start adding in networks,\n\n54\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.860\nthe great thing is it will start\nto add those in there, too.\n\n55\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.545\nSo if I added in another network\nto the right of router 3, or\n\n56\n00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.700\nto the right of router 1.\n\n57\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.160\nIt would go ahead and\nstart doing that idea, and filling in,\n\n58\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.320\nbecause they're exchanging the routing\ntables every 30 seconds here, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.970\nSo there is a problem,\nthough, that can happen, and\n\n60\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.810\nlet me show you what we're talking about.\n\n61\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.930\nDistance vector protocols,\nbecause they're routing by rumor, and\n\n62\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.165\nI kind of just told you\nwhat the rumor was, right?\n\n63\n00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:16.410\nFrom that I said router 3 said, I learned\nabout this route from router 2, and\n\n64\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.490\nso it's actually taking its information\nas being genuine and 100% true.\n\n65\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.800\nAnd then it's calculating its own\nhop to that particular router, and\n\n66\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.840\nit's adding that in.\n\n67\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.370\nThat's where we ended up\ngetting that 2 from, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.360\nSo that's why that happened.\n\n69\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.620\nBut let's go ahead and do something else\nhere that can cause a problem, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.270\nLet's get into this idea of\nrouting loops as well, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.530\nSo now we got the same\nexact thing going on.\n\n72\n00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.620\nBut this time, though, let's do something\nthat's a little bit weird, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.290\nSo here, we'll do it this way.\n\n74\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.710\nLet's say that what I do is\nthat there is a break for\n\n75\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.690\none reason or\nanother of the link that's right.\n\n76\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.550\nActually, let's not do it that way.\n\n77\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.370\nLet's do,\nlet me do it somewhere else instead.\n\n78\n00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.750\nLet me see if I can move that figure and\nlet's say it's broken over here.\n\n79\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.530\nIs this actually make\na little bit better here.\n\n80\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.060\nSo let's say that the link, right, for\n\n81\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.840\nsome reason gigabit ethernet 0/1 is down.\n\n82\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.150\nWe can't get to that network,\nwhatever it might be, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.180\nWell, what ends up happening to\n\n84\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.000\nsome of those different routing\nprotocols that ends up going on, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.830\nSo, this can actually cause some\ndifferent problems that can happen, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.740\nSo, now remember the updates\nthat are happening, right?\n\n87\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.410\nRouter 1 is getting an update\nfrom router 2 at this point.\n\n88\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.320\nAnd they're exchanging, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.350\nBetween router 2 and router 3,\nthey're also getting updates too.\n\n90\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.010\nOkay, so now when router 3\nreports to router 2, okay,\n\n91\n00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.400\nif that is the update that's going on at\nthat particular time, that second that's\n\n92\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.550\ngoing on, well, what happens to that\n200.200.200 network in its routing table?\n\n93\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.360\nWell, it says it's gone, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.080\nSo in theory, the update now is saying,\n\n95\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.970\nlook, the best route that I had before\nhere, okay, it said all I have to do\n\n96\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.740\nis send it over to router 3 out\nof this interface, and it's fine.\n\n97\n00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.870\nThere's the 200 network there.\n\n98\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.300\nSo it will actually have to wait\nthrough a series of timers to say,\n\n99\n00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.720\nlet's just see if it comes back up, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.710\nWhat if it doesn't come\nback up immediately, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.460\nWhat if it takes its sweet\ntime in coming back up?\n\n102\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.990\nWell, in theory, then,\nthis route could disappear.\n\n103\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.630\nOkay, so now router 2 has\nan incomplete routing table.\n\n104\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.590\nIt doesn't know how to get to router 200.\n\n105\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.954\nBut in the middle of that,\nas that route now times out of router 2,\n\n106\n00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.290\nRemember that router 2 and\nrouter 1 also do what?\n\n107\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.990\nThey also update, too.\n\n108\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.990\nSo let's say that before, router 2 sent\nthis out with an incomplete route.\n\n109\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.830\nIn other words, before it actually took\nthis out and sent it over to router 1,\n\n110\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.900\nwhich would make this disappear, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.760\nWell, let's say it actually\njust disappeared here,\n\n112\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.390\nso there's no easy way for\nme to make that disappear quickly.\n\n113\n00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.850\nSo let me do it another way, here, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.360\nSo we'll just kind of pretend that\nthat is not here for right now, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.625\nSo we'll just do it that way\ncuz that's just kind of easier,\n\n116\n00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:30.725\nif I try to erase the whole thing\nit's not gonna get it, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:32.785\nSo let's say that that's gone.\n\n118\n00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:35.435\nSo now router 2 and router 1,\nlet's say that router 1,\n\n119\n00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:39.985\nbefore router 2 sends out this update,\nrouter 1 says, let me send out my update.\n\n120\n00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:42.373\nI'm gonna send you my full routing table.\n\n121\n00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:46.780\nWell, look over here,\nZach, router 1 says what?\n\n122\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.365\nThe 200.200.200.0 network,\nit's still viable,\n\n123\n00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:56.270\nit's still alive, it's still good, okay.\n\n124\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.630\nThat's what it says.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n125\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.960\n&gt;&gt; So what will happen with\n\n126\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.850\nrouter 2 if it receives that update\nbefore it's sending out its update?\n\n127\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.190\nWell, it will update its route for\nthis 200 network.\n\n128\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.780\nSo what has to happen now, as it gets\nthe routing update from router one,\n\n129\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.750\nit will say, hey, you're\n\n130\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.940\nreporting to me that a route for\n200.200.200.0 is good with two hops.\n\n131\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.700\nWe'll, I'm one hop away from you.\n\n132\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.680\nSo you must know of a better route\nsince the other site is not reporting.\n\n133\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.390\nSo its metric will change, and\nthe interface will also now change too.\n\n134\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.890\nOkay, so router 3 now, or\nrouter 2 now updates, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.670\nSounds good, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n136\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.550\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Well,\n\n137\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.340\nthe only problem is, notice that router 3,\nthough, is still down.\n\n138\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.422\nBecause what router 2's gonna do with any\ntraffic coming in for the 200 network,\n\n139\n00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:55.648\nright, it's gonna send\nit over to router 1.\n\n140\n00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.415\nRouter 1's gonna say, well,\n\n141\n00:07:57.415 --> 00:08:01.152\nI'm two hops away from 200 network\ngoing out of this interface.\n\n142\n00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:05.496\nIt's gonna send it one hop\nto router 2 to router 3.\n\n143\n00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:08.840\nAnd router 3 is gonna drop it, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.310\nSo, in that sense, it's still going\nback across router 2 again, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.530\nNow, what that actually is is what\nwe call a routing loop, okay,\n\n146\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.402\nthat is beginning to happen, right?\n\n147\n00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:23.047\nRouter 2 says, I'm sending it to you,\nover here to router 1,\n\n148\n00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:27.240\nlet me see if I can draw an arrow\nhere of some sort, if I can.\n\n149\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:27.863\nI'll try it again.\n\n150\n00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:34.813\nSo it says, a packet destined for 2\n\n151\n00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:41.190\nRight, it sends it over to router 1 here.\n\n152\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.824\nWell then, router 1.\n\n153\n00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:49.720\nSends it over here.\n\n154\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.300\nI don't know why it wouldn't do that.\n\n155\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.968\nOf course, it wouldn't do it that way.\n\n156\n00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:59.176\nAnd then Once again over\nthere to router 3, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:03.850\nWell, notice that is a routing\nloop that begins to happen.\n\n158\n00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.532\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was gonna say,\n\n159\n00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:05.270\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n160\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.170\nthe problem is this loop can continue for\na little while.\n\n161\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.400\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n162\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.056\nLet's just use this with\nthe routing updates.\n\n163\n00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:16.160\nRemember I said that router 1 essentially\nupdates it before router 2 was able to\n\n164\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.538\nreport that it was gone?\n\n165\n00:09:17.538 --> 00:09:26.510\nOkay, well now, router 2 now sends\nout its update to router 1, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.170\nWell, now look what happens.\n\n167\n00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.780\nRouter 1's route for 200 network\nright here, it's different, right?\n\n168\n00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.870\nIt is not exactly the same here, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.900\nSo now what ends up happening is that it\nsays, hey, you're telling me that there's\n\n170\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:49.380\na new route to the 200.200.200 network\nwith 3, and I'm one hop away from you.\n\n171\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.362\nSo, 3 plus 1, that's 4.\n\n172\n00:09:54.362 --> 00:09:58.650\nAnd I heard it from you, so\nlet me also send that out.\n\n173\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.410\nAnd it will again send it out this way.\n\n174\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.970\nNow router 3 jumps back in,\nand it's still not updating.\n\n175\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.540\nNow what happens?\n\n176\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.810\nRouter 3 gets what?\n\n177\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.583\nA new update from router 1 again,\nand router 1 is saying, look, hey,\n\n178\n00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:16.680\nI've got new route to 200 network,\nI'm reporting four.\n\n179\n00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.600\nRouter 2 says, I'm one hop away from you.\n\n180\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.370\nSo that must be 5, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:31.610\nSo then router 2 updates back to router 1\nagain, and it goes, hey, that's a change.\n\n182\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.855\nAnd it again says, you're saying the new\nroute is 5, and I'm one hop away from you.\n\n183\n00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:37.627\nThat means 6.\n\n184\n00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:40.257\nIt will continue to\nincrement like this and\n\n185\n00:10:40.257 --> 00:10:43.540\nthe metric will continue to grow, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.490\nBut there are loop prevention things out\nthere, technologies if you wanna call them\n\n187\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.050\nthat, that help us to stop something\nlike this from happening, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.110\nSo in this sense, right,\nwe'll not stick with the idea of 5, 6,\n\n189\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.450\nbut you see it continue to rise,\nokay, so what happens there?\n\n190\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.870\nTo help us to stop that is that you'll\nsee two different technologies, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.270\nThere is what we call poison reverse and\nsplit horizon, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.850\nActually, technically,\n\n193\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.280\nthe first one's actually what we call\na time to live is what it's called, right?\n\n194\n00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.750\nThere's gonna be\na particular time to live.\n\n195\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.574\nAfter a while with the idea of RIP here,\nright, after so\n\n196\n00:11:20.574 --> 00:11:23.412\nmany different hops it just says,\nI'm dropping this.\n\n197\n00:11:23.412 --> 00:11:26.260\nIt says, I'm just looping around,\nthere's no way.\n\n198\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.240\nSo when it doesn't reach\nit after a period of time,\n\n199\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.240\nwhatever that might be,\ntraditionally it's been 15 hops.\n\n200\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.560\nIt says, once I hit number 15,\nI'm dropping it, I'm done.\n\n201\n00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.315\nSo I won't go to 16,\nthat's just what it will be, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:40.350\nWell, poison reverse essentially\nworks in the same way.\n\n203\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.150\nIt's saying, look, what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna actually say\n\n204\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.870\nhere's the number that\nyou're gonna drop out, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.908\nSo that's the idea of poison reverse,\nwe don't worry about that one too much.\n\n206\n00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:52.180\nSplit horizon, though, if you remember.\n\n207\n00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:59.471\nThe idea of us ending up sending it at\nsome point, right, when we had two hops\n\n208\n00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:03.842\naway, okay, when we had the routing over\nhere on router 1 is two hops away, and\n\n209\n00:12:03.842 --> 00:12:07.665\nit sent data from router 2 to\nrouter 1 to get over there?\n\n210\n00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:10.245\nWell, we don't want that to happen,\neither.\n\n211\n00:12:10.245 --> 00:12:13.768\nSo what ends up happening is that we run\nsomething that we call split horizon.\n\n212\n00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:16.005\nI don't know why I put horizons here.\n\n213\n00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:23.358\nSplit horizon, that says if I got the data\nfrom this interface right over here.\n\n214\n00:12:23.358 --> 00:12:26.516\nIn other words,\nif it sent it out this interface,\n\n215\n00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:31.120\nthis interface right here says,\nI'm not gonna receive that same data.\n\n216\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.230\nSo it prevents it from looping the data.\n\n217\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.260\nSo that way any update that\nactually ends up happening,\n\n218\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.740\nokay, if it's getting that same\nupdate coming in that same interface,\n\n219\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.100\nit says no, okay, or\ndata that comes back in.\n\n220\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.697\nThis is also part of that technology\nthat's not based on the routing protocol,\n\n221\n00:12:49.697 --> 00:12:50.831\nit's not based on that.\n\n222\n00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:53.520\nIt actually is based on the router itself.\n\n223\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.470\nThis is also why we cannot do the inter\nVLAN routing that we had just\n\n224\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.880\ncompleted in our series, if you've watched\nit in the order there, why we can't send\n\n225\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.940\ndata into that interface and expect it\nto come back out that same interface.\n\n226\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.800\nIt is because of split horizon,\nit does not allow that.\n\n227\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.420\nSo we divide that into sub-interfaces.\n\n228\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.660\nThat tricks the router into believing\nthat it's going out a different physical\n\n229\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.000\ninterface, or different interface,\nI should say, not a physical interface.\n\n230\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.270\nBut a different interface, as well, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.710\nSo that is part of the issue\nthat we end up seeing here\n\n232\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.640\nwhen you start seeing something like this.\n\n233\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.940\nSo we have to worry about the idea of\nrouting loops that can happen, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.885\nSo in that sense,\n\n235\n00:13:32.885 --> 00:13:36.710\nwe've gotta pay attention as we\ndo something like this, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.920\nSo, at this point we're just\nabout ready to go ahead and\n\n237\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.830\nswitch on over to our lab\nsetting at this point.\n\n238\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.208\nSo let's go ahead and do that now.\n\n239\n00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:50.540\nAll right, so let's switch on over here.\n\n240\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.640\nNow, I'm gonna be using the lab that\nPracticeLabs.com has set up for\n\n241\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.638\nus called Configure and\nVerify RIPv2 and IPv4.\n\n242\n00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:04.680\nSo we're gonna be using this specifically\nin the lab, if I can click on it here.\n\n243\n00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.350\nAnd, well, I'm trying to, but\nthere it goes, it's scrolling.\n\n244\n00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.890\nWe're really gonna be using two routers,\nthe NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2,\n\n245\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.410\nto accomplish this.\n\n246\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.170\nBut that is the lab that we'll\nbe doing together here, okay,\n\n247\n00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.720\nis the one that we'll be focusing on.\n\n248\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.070\nSo let me go ahead and start here.\n\n249\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.960\nSo they've pre-configured\nsome of this stuff for us, so\n\n250\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.740\nwe didn't have to jump right in to\ndo a lot right at the beginning.\n\n251\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.280\nLet me zoom in just a little bit more so\nthat we can see that as well.\n\n252\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.120\nSo right at the beginning\nwe're gonna configure, or\n\n253\n00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.450\nactually, we're going to turn\non a loop back interface.\n\n254\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.680\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you what we're talking about here.\n\n255\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.879\nSo let's get into our privilege exempt\nmode, show ip interface brief, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.000\nSo right now you see that\nthere's loopback0 here, and\n\n257\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.690\nyou see where it says it's\nadministratively down.\n\n258\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.050\nThat is the interface that we're\ngonna be turning on right now to\n\n259\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.010\nget it in part of the routing table\nthat we want it to be in, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.760\nSo I'm going to get into our\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n261\n00:15:12.221 --> 00:15:17.081\nAnd then into interface loopback0.\n\n262\n00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:22.024\nRemember that this is a virtual interface,\nand this will essentially report that it's\n\n263\n00:15:22.024 --> 00:15:26.367\nanother interface that's turned on,\neven though there's no more physical\n\n264\n00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:31.020\ninterfaces for us to deal with or\nto have to connect to at this point, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.670\nSo now that I've got that set up,\n\n266\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.830\nit's not exactly the hardest\nthing in the world, but\n\n267\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.570\nthis adds another network that we can use\nto help us to verify and to test, okay?\n\n268\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.356\nNow we're ready to configure RIP, okay,\nso when we start configuring RIP.\n\n269\n00:15:44.356 --> 00:15:50.040\nLet me zoom in once again a little bit\nmore to help us out just one more time.\n\n270\n00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.687\nNeed to do an exit.\n\n271\n00:15:52.687 --> 00:15:55.980\nIt's an easy configuration, and\nit is relatively easy here.\n\n272\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.684\nWe type in the word router and\n\n273\n00:15:57.684 --> 00:16:00.672\nthen whatever the routing\nprotocol that we want.\n\n274\n00:16:00.672 --> 00:16:04.689\nSo I'm just typing in the word router,\nand you see that this particular router,\n\n275\n00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:06.800\nwell it supports a lot of different ones.\n\n276\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.860\nNow we didn't talk about some of these,\nlike BGP here and\n\n277\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.860\nISIS and stuff like that, we mentioned it.\n\n278\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.360\nIntermediate system to\nintermediate system, but\n\n279\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.770\nwe really didn't talk about them.\n\n280\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.590\nAnd today they've even added in mobile\nroutes and some other stuff here, but for\n\n281\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.670\nus we're strictly going to\ndo the idea of RIP here.\n\n282\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.630\nSo this router can actually handle quite\na bit of different routing protocols for\n\n283\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.180\nus, so we'll do router RIP.\n\n284\n00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:41.330\nNow for us to get into version two we type\nin version two is what we're gonna do.\n\n285\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:46.490\nNow remember that by default, router\nrip is a class for routing protocol,\n\n286\n00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.770\nand that means also by default,\nrip version two is set that way too.\n\n287\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.850\nWe're going to turn this off\na little bit later, so my default,\n\n288\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.870\nwhen I do this it's like, automatic.\n\n289\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:00.270\nAs soon as I do it, I normally also do a\nno auto-summary but because we wanna make\n\n290\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:05.050\na point here, we're gonna leave that\noff for right now, that is what I do.\n\n291\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.826\nSo here, what do we have to do?\n\n292\n00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:10.605\nIt's just like what we saw in our diagram.\n\n293\n00:17:10.605 --> 00:17:14.391\nSo what I need to do with NYEDGE1\nis that I need to configure,\n\n294\n00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:18.238\nwell the routes that are actually\noff of this network.\n\n295\n00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:21.100\nNow if you're not sure,\n\n296\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.005\nwhat I always do is I do\nshow Ip interface and\n\n297\n00:17:26.005 --> 00:17:31.610\nbrief here and\nthis will help us out for a moment.\n\n298\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.420\nSo this allows me to be able\nto configure what I need to.\n\n299\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.400\nSo at the very beginning there's actually\ntwo networks that I need to configure.\n\n300\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.304\nAnd essentially they'll end up being\na third at some point here which\n\n301\n00:17:44.304 --> 00:17:46.848\nwe'll add in a little bit later on.\n\n302\n00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:48.194\nSo we're going to do network.\n\n303\n00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:53.445\nIf I can spell network,\n\n304\n00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:58.110\nnetwork 172.18 0.0.\n\n305\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:04.070\nRemember that the 172 network, for\nus is part of that class B network.\n\n306\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.010\nYou can try and put in whatever you want\nto, but because we've already turned it\n\n307\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.040\noff, we're just entering in just\nthe network statements here.\n\n308\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.571\nSo we're doing network, and\nthen we have a 192.168 16.0.\n\n309\n00:18:17.571 --> 00:18:20.700\nAnd we're running that 192.168,\nthat's a Class C network.\n\n310\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.750\nSo that's why I have the first\nthree octets also filled out.\n\n311\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.059\nAnd then we're gonna add in another one\neven though right now it doesn't look like\n\n312\n00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:29.439\nit exists in our lab here.\n\n313\n00:18:29.439 --> 00:18:34.562\nSo we're gonna do 172.14.0.0 as well.\n\n314\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.260\nOkay, that's about it.\n\n315\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.700\nNow how do I know that rip is actually\nworking right now in its background and\n\n316\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.080\nwhat it's doing here?\n\n317\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.245\nIf I go back out here,\nI can type in a show Ip.\n\n318\n00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:52.240\nProtocols just to verify that it is\n\n319\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.670\nworking.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.480\n&gt;&gt; So there it is,\n\n321\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.410\nrouting protocol is rip.\n\n322\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.980\nSo you see it's actually on now, and then\nat the same you are now starting to see\n\n323\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.089\nthere are a couple of\ninterfaces that are going on.\n\n324\n00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:06.330\nAnd it's routing from these networks,\neven though one network right not\n\n325\n00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.512\ndoes not exist,\nat least on an interface that we have.\n\n326\n00:19:10.512 --> 00:19:14.670\nSo that's fine for what we want,\nto report right now.\n\n327\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.600\nNow, the other side is what\nwe need to configure, so\n\n328\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.740\nI am going to NYEDGE1, and\nessentially do the same thing.\n\n329\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.820\nSo on NYEDGE2, I should say, so\n\n330\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:33.430\nover on NYEDGE2, let's get access in,\nprivilege exempt mode.\n\n331\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:38.425\nAnd then, once we're here,\nwe're going to our global\n\n332\n00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:44.180\nconfiguration model as well and\nthen router rip and Version 2.\n\n333\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:49.948\nYou see that the configuration of making\nrep work isn't really complicated.\n\n334\n00:19:49.948 --> 00:19:50.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n335\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.400\n&gt;&gt; The explaining of how the routes went,\n\n336\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.845\nthat was much more complicated\nthan what I am doing right here.\n\n337\n00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:58.420\nIt's me just knowing what networks\nare actually available to\n\n338\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.710\ndo whatever I want to do.\n\n339\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.678\nSo here, we do network, and\n\n340\n00:20:04.678 --> 00:20:12.231\non NYEDGE2 we're gonna do 172.14.0.0 and\n\n341\n00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:18.318\nthen network 192.168.16.0,\n\n342\n00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:22.373\nAs well.\n\n343\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.391\nAnd now let's see if this\nis actually working so far.\n\n344\n00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:27.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n345\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.140\nSo let's think about this.\n\n346\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.532\nI put in the network that was common\nin between, actually two of them.\n\n347\n00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:39.085\nThe 192.168.16.0 is actually common\nbetween NYEDGE1 and NYEDGE2.\n\n348\n00:20:39.085 --> 00:20:42.452\nAnd the 172 14.0.0, that's also common.\n\n349\n00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:48.279\nThe one that is not that I\nconfigured on NYEDGE1 is the 172.18.\n\n350\n00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:52.930\nSo that's not configured on NYEDGE2 here,\nbut can we get access to it?\n\n351\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:59.040\nWell let's see,\nif I type in a show okay Ip route and\n\n352\n00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.200\nwe'll use the pipe sign here to help\nus to filter this out a little better.\n\n353\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.130\nAnd now let's get rid of the legend\nthat normally appears before the routing\n\n354\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.990\ntable here and then type in Gateway.\n\n355\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.630\nNow after the B or after the word begin,\nit actually is case sensitive.\n\n356\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.170\nSo whenever it appears,\nI'll show you what I'm talking about here.\n\n357\n00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.670\nAnd we'll see what happens.\n\n358\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.670\nSo notice that the term\nright here is Gateway.\n\n359\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.150\nAnd see how this is actually capitalized?\n\n360\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.090\nYou want to use some of those shortcuts.\n\n361\n00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.770\nThey are case sensitive when you\ndo the filtering at the end there.\n\n362\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.730\nAnd just realize that they're\nspace sensitive and everything.\n\n363\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.860\nSo, just be aware, okay.\n\n364\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.660\nNow, what I'm looking for.\n\n365\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.480\nEl, look.\n\n366\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.530\nIs the letter r which means\nthat learn it from reap and\n\n367\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.680\nZach, you can see right here that\nI learned about the other route\n\n368\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.330\nthat we typed in on the other side.\n\n369\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n370\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.840\n&gt;&gt; That it is there and\n\n371\n00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.840\nthat it actually did learn about it.\n\n372\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.780\n172.18 is there, I didn't type that one\nin on NYEDGE2 so that's actually pretty\n\n373\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.510\ngood for what we wanted to make sure that\nwe accomplished here as we did this, okay?\n\n374\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:06.030\nSo this works out for us in what happens\nSo why did this work the way that it did?\n\n375\n00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.220\nIt's because the routing table is being\nexchanged every 30 seconds or so.\n\n376\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:10.900\nOkay.\n\n377\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.150\nSo now, let's see.\n\n378\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.990\nLet me, and so\nsometimes you do have to wait for\n\n379\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.360\nthis stuff to kind of work, so\nit's not the fastest thing in the world.\n\n380\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.030\nSee if I can go back to NY edge one here.\n\n381\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:28.510\nFor a moment and let's kind of focus\non a couple of things to, okay.\n\n382\n00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.090\nSo back here on the routing protocols,\nright.\n\n383\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.440\nAnd we'll start taking a look.\n\n384\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.250\nHere's some of the description\nthat it's doing, right,\n\n385\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.050\nabout the idea of the timers,\nwhich we'll get to.\n\n386\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:46.520\nBut if we do that routing table again,\nshow Ip route here.\n\n387\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.460\nThis time I didn't filter it out so\nthat we can see this.\n\n388\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.450\nNotice that there is\nthis timer right here.\n\n389\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.150\nSo for RIP on the other side it's\nlearning about the 14 network,\n\n390\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.300\neven though we typed it in here and\nit's not really directly connected,\n\n391\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.130\nit actually does say\nthat it learned about it.\n\n392\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.300\nAnd it's been alive for\nabout six seconds now.\n\n393\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.210\nOkay, so that's where the route is.\n\n394\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.000\nNow if we do the same thing,\nshow Ip route again,\n\n395\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.320\nnow notice the timer here is\nactually starting to go down.\n\n396\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.390\nSo I may lying to you, it's actually\ncounting down, not counting up.\n\n397\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.420\nSo it's actually doing it.\n\n398\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.970\nLet's do it one more time, show Ip route.\n\n399\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.930\nThis is where having access to the real\nrouter helps cuz all I have to do\n\n400\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.820\nis hit the up arrow,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n401\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.020\nAnd it starts.\n\n402\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.520\nSo now, you can see the timer started over\n\n403\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.690\nat 30 seconds,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n404\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.570\n&gt;&gt; And it's counting down from 19 all\n\n405\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.490\nthe way down to 0, just to see if\nit's actually getting updated.\n\n406\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.580\nSo, here is just an example\nin what you're seeing.\n\n407\n00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.489\nSo those timers are live,\nthey are actually configuring,\n\n408\n00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:50.761\nthey're working in that timing\nfashion in the way that we said so.\n\n409\n00:23:50.761 --> 00:23:53.971\nSo if it doesn't happen in that\n30 seconds, in other words,\n\n410\n00:23:53.971 --> 00:23:57.544\nif there's a change here, it will\nnotice it and then it will hold it for\n\n411\n00:23:57.544 --> 00:23:59.463\na brief period of time.\n\n412\n00:23:59.463 --> 00:24:02.665\nI wanna talk about how we can configure\nthat, and make it work for us.\n\n413\n00:24:02.665 --> 00:24:08.496\nNow, we're about close on the end of\nour time for this episode, as well.\n\n414\n00:24:08.496 --> 00:24:12.281\nBut there is one more concept that\nwe want to get in here, okay?\n\n415\n00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:16.485\nBefore we end this episode, and\nthen have to move on to a part three for\n\n416\n00:24:16.485 --> 00:24:18.090\nwhat we have here, okay?\n\n417\n00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.201\nThere is something that we\ncall Passive Interfaces, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:27.115\nSo let me see if I can go back\nto our diagram here just for\n\n419\n00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:29.751\na second to help us out.\n\n420\n00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:33.118\nAll right, so\nlet me take this away just briefly.\n\n421\n00:24:35.626 --> 00:24:37.832\nHere for a moment, okay?\n\n422\n00:24:37.832 --> 00:24:40.525\nNow, let's do something like this, okay?\n\n423\n00:24:40.525 --> 00:24:43.369\nWhat could end up happening here, right?\n\n424\n00:24:43.369 --> 00:24:48.730\nIs that out of every interface\non Router 3 at this point, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.621\nIt is when we turn on RIP, right?\n\n426\n00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:54.850\nIt's actually gonna update out of both\nsides, it's gonna receive updates on both\n\n427\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.119\nsides, right?\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n428\n00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.139\n&gt;&gt; So well, Router 2 proves that.\n\n429\n00:24:58.139 --> 00:24:59.715\nThe way that we just showed you,\nit proves it, right?\n\n430\n00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:04.219\nIt's getting updates from, you can see\nhere from G01, which is Router 3, and\n\n431\n00:25:04.219 --> 00:25:07.369\nthe other G0 here is actually again,\nRouter 1, okay?\n\n432\n00:25:07.369 --> 00:25:08.414\nSo it's getting those updates.\n\n433\n00:25:08.414 --> 00:25:10.991\nIt's doing what it actually\nneeds to do here, right?\n\n434\n00:25:10.991 --> 00:25:14.241\nNow, a lot of times when I start seeing\nthis, I start seeing some errors here.\n\n435\n00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:17.747\nSo on these that are directly learned, the\ninterface probably won't be there, you'll\n\n436\n00:25:17.747 --> 00:25:20.944\njust see a letter C instead, but I'm not\ngoing to worry about that for right now.\n\n437\n00:25:20.944 --> 00:25:24.006\nBut when you actually start\nseeing something like this,\n\n438\n00:25:24.006 --> 00:25:27.400\nit really does help to understand\nthat that is a lot of traffic.\n\n439\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.919\nEvery 30 seconds it's sending\nits full routing tape.\n\n440\n00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:31.878\nNow, with four, it's not so big deal.\n\n441\n00:25:31.878 --> 00:25:35.494\nOnce you get to 25, 30 routes,\nyou start getting something like that,\n\n442\n00:25:35.494 --> 00:25:36.748\nit becomes a bigger deal.\n\n443\n00:25:36.748 --> 00:25:40.955\nBecause that's a lot of information that's\njust being exchanged Just to keep those\n\n444\n00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:44.165\nrouters update every 30 seconds,\nthe entire routing table.\n\n445\n00:25:44.165 --> 00:25:46.440\nSo it can build up very quickly.\n\n446\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.263\nBut what if you actually have something\nlike what we see here on the left\n\n447\n00:25:51.263 --> 00:25:54.138\nof Router 1, and the right of Router 3.\n\n448\n00:25:54.138 --> 00:25:58.248\nNow, what I mean by that is\nthere is not another router.\n\n449\n00:25:58.248 --> 00:26:03.083\nLet's say on the left of Router 1,\ndo I need to go ahead and\n\n450\n00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:07.723\nsend out a copy of the routing table to or\nthrough G01,\n\n451\n00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:11.901\nif there's not another\nrouter on the other side?\n\n452\n00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:14.003\nNo, because what is it updating?\n\n453\n00:26:14.003 --> 00:26:18.738\nIt's not, so that means that all I'm doing\nis I'm just generating extra traffic out\n\n454\n00:26:18.738 --> 00:26:21.460\nto a network that doesn't\nhave another router.\n\n455\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.539\nAnd it's just flooding that particular\nnetwork every 30 seconds with the routing\n\n456\n00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:29.159\ntable, even though there's nothing\nthere to receive it, to update, and\n\n457\n00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:30.956\nit's not getting any updates back.\n\n458\n00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:33.806\nSo what you can I can actually do instead,\n\n459\n00:26:33.806 --> 00:26:36.825\nis that we can take one\nof those interfaces.\n\n460\n00:26:36.825 --> 00:26:39.913\nIt can still participate in RIB But,\n\n461\n00:26:39.913 --> 00:26:44.001\nit doesn't have to send the updates out,\nokay?\n\n462\n00:26:44.001 --> 00:26:45.870\nOf that interface, okay?\n\n463\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.995\nIt doesn't have to,\n\n464\n00:26:46.995 --> 00:26:50.808\nit also doesn't have to listen to\nupdates out of that interface either.\n\n465\n00:26:50.808 --> 00:26:52.646\nBecause it makes no sense for\n\n466\n00:26:52.646 --> 00:26:58.246\nanything over here in this 192168.0\nnetwork to be sending an update, right?\n\n467\n00:26:58.246 --> 00:27:03.110\nThe only update that this router actually\nneed is from Router 2 on this side.\n\n468\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.616\nIt doesn't need anything over\non the left hand side and\n\n469\n00:27:05.616 --> 00:27:09.165\nthe same thing with Router 3, it doesn't\nneed anything over here instead.\n\n470\n00:27:09.165 --> 00:27:13.634\nSo now, what we can do is we can configure\nit as a passive interface which means you\n\n471\n00:27:13.634 --> 00:27:18.335\nare in rip, you're reported as being in\nrip but you're not gonna send updates out.\n\n472\n00:27:18.335 --> 00:27:21.398\nYou're not gonna receive\nupdates on it in that way okay?\n\n473\n00:27:21.398 --> 00:27:23.581\nBut you're still a part of rip.\n\n474\n00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:26.973\nSo here on NYEdgeWanda, okay?\n\n475\n00:27:26.973 --> 00:27:30.944\nWhen we start seeing this,\noops, let me close that.\n\n476\n00:27:30.944 --> 00:27:31.450\nI was like,\n\n477\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.487\nwhy is there a red bar on top of my lab.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:34.805\n&gt;&gt; That's never a good sign when\n\n479\n00:27:34.805 --> 00:27:35.495\nyour looking.\n\n480\n00:27:35.495 --> 00:27:37.341\nOkay, wait a minute.\n&gt;&gt; Danger, danger.\n\n481\n00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:39.826\n&gt;&gt; Danger, that is not a good sign.\n\n482\n00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:44.726\nSo we're gonna take NYEdge1, and we're\ngonna use that loop back address, is what\n\n483\n00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:49.851\nwe're gonna do, that loop back interface,\nto configure a passive interface, okay?\n\n484\n00:27:49.851 --> 00:27:53.067\nSo let me go into our global\nconfiguration terminal.\n\n485\n00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:56.961\nAnd then once I'm in here I'm\ngonna go into the router itself,\n\n486\n00:27:56.961 --> 00:27:58.290\nwhich is router RIP.\n\n487\n00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:02.351\nAnd you'll know that you're in the router\nconfiguration, check out the prompt,\n\n488\n00:28:02.351 --> 00:28:03.290\nconfig-router.\n\n489\n00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.066\nYou know you're inside of that.\n\n490\n00:28:05.066 --> 00:28:07.955\nThen you can go ahead and\n\n491\n00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:13.880\ntype in passive interface,\nand then loop back,\n\n492\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.803\nand we're gonna do 0 here, all right?\n\n493\n00:28:18.803 --> 00:28:24.629\nNow, I chose Router 1 because earlier,\nas I scroll back through here,\n\n494\n00:28:24.629 --> 00:28:28.558\nI had actually ran the show IP protocols,\nokay?\n\n495\n00:28:28.558 --> 00:28:31.403\nThere's a couple of sections down here,\nright?\n\n496\n00:28:31.403 --> 00:28:33.950\nNotice that there's routing for\nthese networks here.\n\n497\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.700\nYou're also seeing the routing\ninformation sources here too.\n\n498\n00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.618\nAnd the default\nadministrative distance for\n\n499\n00:28:40.618 --> 00:28:43.773\nRIP is 120, which is perfectly fine, okay?\n\n500\n00:28:43.773 --> 00:28:48.708\nNow, if I run this again, now that I've\nadded this passive interface in here\n\n501\n00:28:52.539 --> 00:28:55.244\nShow IP protocols.\n\n502\n00:28:58.332 --> 00:29:05.073\nNow, notice it added in another section\nwhich is right here, Passive Interfaces.\n\n503\n00:29:05.073 --> 00:29:09.588\nRemember Passive Interface doesn't\nmean that it's excluded from RIP.\n\n504\n00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:15.992\nNotice that RIP is still advertising\n172.18.0.0 is still advertising it.\n\n505\n00:29:15.992 --> 00:29:20.750\nBut it's not gonna advertise it through\nthe loop back interface because\n\n506\n00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.858\nthere is no router to accept it.\n\n507\n00:29:22.858 --> 00:29:27.870\nSo turning off some of the stuff that you\ndon't wanted to participate, especially\n\n508\n00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.462\non those devices that are essentially\nthat kind of singular point, right?\n\n509\n00:29:32.462 --> 00:29:36.292\nFor your network to get out,\nif you're participating in RIP,\n\n510\n00:29:36.292 --> 00:29:39.400\nagain participate in the once\nthat go to routers and\n\n511\n00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.667\nturn off the ideas sending the routing\ntable in network which doesn't\n\n512\n00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:48.175\nhave another router to actually update and\ndo all that stuff with as well.\n\n513\n00:29:48.175 --> 00:29:52.378\nThat will save you on bandwidth a lot\nof times, but at the same time, right?\n\n514\n00:29:52.378 --> 00:29:57.208\nYou're actually being very much\nthe idea of efficient with what you\n\n515\n00:29:57.208 --> 00:29:58.911\nhave available to you.\n\n516\n00:29:58.911 --> 00:30:02.861\nSo now we're only going to be sending\nout the other two interfaces that we're\n\n517\n00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:04.501\nconnected to in our network, or\n\n518\n00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:07.143\nthe singular interface\nthat we're connected to.\n\n519\n00:30:07.143 --> 00:30:09.628\nAnd then we're not sending\nit out the other one, okay?\n\n520\n00:30:09.628 --> 00:30:12.375\nSo Passive Interfaces\nthey are a part of it and\n\n521\n00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:15.423\ndon't forget it is called\nout on the exam as well.\n\n522\n00:30:15.423 --> 00:30:20.520\nSo remember that you're gonna configure\nthat inside of the router RIP, okay?\n\n523\n00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.876\nAnd then in their passive-interface.\n\n524\n00:30:22.876 --> 00:30:25.953\nAnd then in the interface itself and\nthat's what will do it.\n\n525\n00:30:25.953 --> 00:30:30.768\nYou can verify that you did\nconfigure it right here in this\n\n526\n00:30:30.768 --> 00:30:33.085\nshow IP protocols, okay?\n\n527\n00:30:33.085 --> 00:30:38.013\nSo that is a big part of what\nwe also end up doing too, okay?\n\n528\n00:30:38.013 --> 00:30:41.996\nSo now that we have that ready to go,\nokay?\n\n529\n00:30:41.996 --> 00:30:45.365\nThere are still a few concepts\nwe haven't gotten to yet.\n\n530\n00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:48.423\nSo we'll need a little bit of\nexplanation for that as well,\n\n531\n00:30:48.423 --> 00:30:51.419\nwhich is now we're gonna deal\nwith the idea of timers, and\n\n532\n00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:54.440\nwhy they are also important to and\nalso the rest of our lab.\n\n533\n00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.133\nSo, Zach, this is a good place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n534\n00:30:57.133 --> 00:30:59.119\n&gt;&gt; So here's a bunch of numbers, ready?\n\n535\n00:30:59.119 --> 00:31:02.292\nOkay, you've configured RIP version 2 for\nIPv4.\n\n536\n00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:04.668\nThis is part two,\nthere will be a part three.\n\n537\n00:31:04.668 --> 00:31:06.538\nMake sure you see all of those things.\n\n538\n00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:08.860\nAnd by the way, Ronnie, anything else\nyou'd like to say before we move on?\n\n539\n00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.868\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again, practice is key.\n\n540\n00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:14.502\nAnd at this point here,\nthis is a bunch of new concepts, right?\n\n541\n00:31:14.502 --> 00:31:16.701\nIf you haven't been working\nwith routing protocols,\n\n542\n00:31:16.701 --> 00:31:18.335\nthere's a lot of information to learn.\n\n543\n00:31:18.335 --> 00:31:21.832\nSo go through, make sure you\nunderstand the updating concept and\n\n544\n00:31:21.832 --> 00:31:23.365\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n545\n00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:27.211\nAnd then you actually see\nthe configuration is relatively simple,\n\n546\n00:31:27.211 --> 00:31:29.310\nthere's not really complex at all.\n\n547\n00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.010\nBecause doing it in background,\ncuz it runs an algorithm,\n\n548\n00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.359\nthat's another good thing about me\nnot having run static routes as well.\n\n549\n00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:39.217\nBut just remember, go through this lab,\nconfigure it to that point where\n\n550\n00:31:39.217 --> 00:31:43.386\nyou're working fast and quickly through\nit, is what you want to be able to do and\n\n551\n00:31:43.386 --> 00:31:46.580\nthat's what will help you also\nas you get ready for the exam.\n\n552\n00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.047\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n553\n00:31:48.047 --> 00:31:51.909\nAnd make sure you watch every\nsingle episode

00:00:10.720\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.916\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:16.991\nHello, and thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:20.729\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nwith this episode of Cisco CCent.\n\n7\n00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.394\nRight now, believe it or not,\n\n8\n00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:28.863\nwe're gonna configure RIP version 2 for\nIPv4, part three.\n\n9\n00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:31.420\n[LAUGH] That's a lot of numbers, and\n\n10\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.780\nthe person bringing us all the information\nwe need is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.130\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.580\nThank you for having me back on the show,\n\n13\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.970\nas we continue on in the lab that we\nkinda started just in the last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.820\nWe started talking about dynamic routing\nprotocols just a couple episodes ago, and\n\n15\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.750\nnow we're carrying through and\n\n16\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.500\nwe're setting up, of course,\nRIP version two in our CCent journey.\n\n17\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.980\nRemember that every day, you should be\npracticing how to begin configuring and\n\n18\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.890\nworking with your routers and switches.\n\n19\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.750\nAnd remember,\nif you don't have the physical ones,\n\n20\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.110\nyou do have access to practicelabs.com.\n\n21\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.640\nOur lab partner that provides\nyou access to real equipment, so\n\n22\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270\nyou're not using a simulator,\nyou're not using an emulator.\n\n23\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.440\nYou're using the real equipment, and\nthat does actually help you out, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.910\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n25\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.810\nwe are now continuing to kind of see\nsome of the stuff that we need to do.\n\n26\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.905\nSo, when we ended the previous episode,\nwe had just configured passive interfaces.\n\n27\n00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.740\nRight.\nAnd remember that idea means that normally\n\n28\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.170\nfor us, if we have an interface,\n\n29\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.060\nsomewhere that is not going to\nbe connected to another router.\n\n30\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.970\nLet's say it is facing our own land, and\n\n31\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.560\nwe don't have another router internally,\nthen I don't need to send routing updates.\n\n32\n00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.245\nI don't need to be receiving\nany routing updates.\n\n33\n00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.740\nTurning it as a passive interface,\nso don't go ahead and do that.\n\n34\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.270\nDon't send those updates out.\n\n35\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.700\nDon't participate in it.\n\n36\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.650\nSo we're not worried about it.\n\n37\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.230\nBut it will still work inside a Rip.\n\n38\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.790\nOkay?\n\n39\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.110\nSo we're not doing that.\n\n40\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.850\nNow, we need to talk about something\nwe've been floating around here.\n\n41\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.530\nI've pointed it out here a couple of times\ntrying to hold back the explanation,\n\n42\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.900\nbecause we also see some information,\n\n43\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.300\nspecifically right here under\nthe show IP protocols, right?\n\n44\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.110\nWhich is the idea of these timers\nthat we've been hinting around.\n\n45\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.820\nIn the routing updates that tend to happen\nfor what you and I are looking at okay?\n\n46\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.140\nRemember that every router really\ndoes send updates every 30 seconds,\n\n47\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.650\nand the great thing is you can see\nwhen a router is actually doing that.\n\n48\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.560\nSo let's run that command again.\n\n49\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.730\nOops, let me see if I can stay\nwith the proper router here, and\n\n50\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.060\nget access to it, so there we go.\n\n51\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.470\nI'll try to do that right here,\nand I'll zoom in.\n\n52\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.470\nSo let's do a show IP protocols for\na moment.\n\n53\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.560\nAnd now you can see that the next\none is due in 21 seconds.\n\n54\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.160\nOkay.\nSo when we start seeing that,\n\n55\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.860\nthe updates is actually being sent,\nif there's updates,\n\n56\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.913\nit's actually doing it every 30 seconds.\n\n57\n00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:09.016\nSo whatever this one is, ideally what\nshould happen is between this one and\n\n58\n00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:11.790\nNYEDGE1, It would be identical.\n\n59\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.020\nIn other words, when this one says 21\nseconds, EDGE2 would also say 21 seconds.\n\n60\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.440\nBut if you did that,\nthings would start to happen as well,\n\n61\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.580\nbecause you might have collisions,\nyou might have some different things\n\n62\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.340\nthat happen as they're sending and\nreceiving data.\n\n63\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.920\nBut you tend to actually have\neverything kinda slowed down,\n\n64\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.590\nwhen stuff like that does happen as well.\n\n65\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.690\nBut because they are a little bit\noff sync too, you can also have\n\n66\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.020\nissues like what we described,\nthat cause routing loops as well.\n\n67\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.850\nSo if we actually take a look,\n\n68\n00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.820\nright, let's make sure we\nunderstand these numbers, okay.\n\n69\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.240\nThe very first one, like we said here,\nis probably the key number.\n\n70\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.600\nEvery 30 seconds, okay, is when we\nsend out the entire routing table.\n\n71\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.830\nNot a partial update, but\nthe entire routing table.\n\n72\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.100\nBut now notice that it doesn't\nget rid of it immediately, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.530\nSo what we're also seeing is, after about\nthree minutes here, okay, after about\n\n74\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.430\nthree minutes, it is going to say look,\nif I don't hear a routing update, I'm not\n\n75\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.280\ngonna just dump it out of the table, but\nlet's say in three minutes time, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.470\nThen I'll consider it invalid.\n\n77\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.300\nHm.\nAnd invalid just means I'm not\n\n78\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.120\ngonna consider it as\nactually being a good route.\n\n79\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.840\nI'm just going to kind of say,\nsomething may be wrong with this, and\n\n80\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.670\nnot do anything.\n\n81\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.510\nOkay.\n\n82\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.780\nThen it has a hold down time of\nanother about three minutes as well.\n\n83\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.610\nHold down time is saying look, let me hold\non this, just in case it's just a glitch.\n\n84\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.343\nRouters are rebooting or something,\nand we don't wanna get rid of it, but\n\n85\n00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:42.074\nif I do that, we'll have to learn\nthe entire routing table over again, but\n\n86\n00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:44.640\nafter essentially six\nminutes here all together.\n\n87\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.840\nSo it could be upwards to what,\nalmost six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\n\n88\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.600\nmaybe almost 12 minutes, before\neverything actually gets back into place.\n\n89\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.170\nSo it's a very slow updating process.\n\n90\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.995\nIt's a very slow thing that can happen.\n\n91\n00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:00.530\nMm-hm.\n\n92\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.680\nIf we don't have things working\nthe way that we want to.\n\n93\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680\nAnd if one of those gets upset,\n\n94\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.020\nin terms of the timing of things,\nthat's when routing loops can happen.\n\n95\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.110\nSo when you set up for\n\n96\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.650\nthe idea here of your timers,\nusually the best practice is this.\n\n97\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.570\nYou can adjust these timers, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.450\nBut you should normally only adjust\nthem if you have a need to adjust them.\n\n99\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.970\nIn other words, if somebody can tell you,\nhere's a good reason to adjust them.\n\n100\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.300\nIt is taking too long for\na route to time out.\n\n101\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.380\nAdjust them, that's way too long.\n\n102\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.110\nI don't want that.\n\n103\n00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.340\nI want it to pick up immediately.\n\n104\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.090\nI want to do this.\n\n105\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.090\nJust take that time,\nmake sure she does what you want it to do.\n\n106\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.680\nThat's what has to happened.\n\n107\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.440\nNow if you do that,\nmake sure you also take a look and\n\n108\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.718\nverify for\nanything like loops that can happen.\n\n109\n00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:52.998\nIf that starts to happen,\nwhat it means is,\n\n110\n00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:55.790\nyou need to adjust them to be the same.\n\n111\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.680\nSo whatever is inside your administrative\ndomain, your autonomous system,\n\n112\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.620\nI said administrative system\nin an earlier segment here.\n\n113\n00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.530\nBut it's the autonomous, I don't know\nwhy I can't keep that word in my head\n\n114\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.350\nin your own autonomous\nsystem at that point.\n\n115\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.580\nIf you do something like that, well, just\nmake sure you set them all the same, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.100\nSo here, we're gonna show you\nhow to adjust those timers,\n\n117\n00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.020\nif I can actually keep\nthe router on my screen here.\n\n118\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.570\nI may show you that instead, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.440\nSo let's go ahead and set up some of\nthe adjustments on the timers here.\n\n120\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.870\nNow this is a little bit of\na strange configuration for\n\n121\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.510\nus to be playing with here.\n\n122\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.100\nSo let me show you what I mean by that.\n\n123\n00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.230\nNow we're gonna get into, of course,\nour global configuration mode.\n\n124\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.830\nAnd let's run our global configuration\nmode back into router rip.\n\n125\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.960\nAnd now I'm inside, of course,\nof the rip configuration, the router here.\n\n126\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.790\nOnce I do this, we're gonna actually\nset timers, and then, the term basic.\n\n127\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.990\nThere's no advanced system.\n\n128\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.520\nLet me see if I can show you that,\nI'll just set up timers.\n\n129\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.810\nAnd now notice it says, incomplete.\n\n130\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.680\nThat's the only option that we have.\n\n131\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.770\nSo it has to be timers basic, and now,\n\n132\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.510\nthis is where it begins to get\na little bit more unusual.\n\n133\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.170\nSo the first thing that it says is, what's\nyour interval for your updates in between.\n\n134\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.128\nWell if 30 seconds is too long, if you go\nwow, no, I need that update a lot quicker\n\n135\n00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:21.790\nthan that, let's set this for\nhalf of that, which is 15.\n\n136\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.120\nNow, I'm going to do\nanother question mark here,\n\n137\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.720\nbecause it doesn't tell\nyou what you should do.\n\n138\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.440\nRight?\nNo actually I don't need to do that.\n\n139\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.438\nI need to do the whole thing.\n\n140\n00:07:30.438 --> 00:07:33.320\nI forgot,\nthis thing doesn't allow me to add in.\n\n141\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.811\nIt just says timer, basic.\n\n142\n00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.780\nThis is gonna be annoying here,\nI can feel it.\n\n143\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.210\n15, and now notice that once we\ndo something like that as well,\n\n144\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.330\nit says that there's\nan incomplete command.\n\n145\n00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.630\nSo let's do timer.\n\n146\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.918\nSo this is why it's annoying.\n\n147\n00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:55.688\nTimer, basic, 15, and\nthen a question mark again,\n\n148\n00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:59.405\nand let's see, what are we looking for?\n\n149\n00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:00.949\nWell, I'm lying to you.\n\n150\n00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.155\nIt actually is saying,\nincomplete is what it's saying.\n\n151\n00:08:05.155 --> 00:08:08.231\nSo it's just going to make me\ntype them all in at one time.\n\n152\n00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:13.689\nSo timer basic, and\nthen I can do 15, oops.\n\n153\n00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:19.111\nThen I can do 90, which, I'm cutting\nthat idea of that invalid time in half.\n\n154\n00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:23.058\nAnd then that other 180 in half for\nthe whole downtime.\n\n155\n00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:28.052\nAnd then lastly, we're gonna cut the 240\nin half for that time that it waits\n\n156\n00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:32.605\nuntil it actually flushes it out\nthe table here, that's what we want.\n\n157\n00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:33.940\nAnd now it accepts the whole thing.\n\n158\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.900\nSo it didn't like the very fact that\nI only did piecemeal at a time.\n\n159\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.543\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It actually made me type in the whole\n\n160\n00:08:39.543 --> 00:08:40.066\nthing.\n\n161\n00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:41.529\nThat is what we end up seeing here.\n\n162\n00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:45.972\nBut yeah, you're not gonna know what\nthat is unless you walk through\n\n163\n00:08:45.972 --> 00:08:49.355\nthat procedure here of making\nsure that you do this.\n\n164\n00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:53.346\nAnd the great thing is this step\nis actually in your lab and\n\n165\n00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:56.938\nit corresponds directly\nto these numbers up here.\n\n166\n00:08:56.938 --> 00:09:03.060\n30 seconds we cut down to 15,\ninvalid after 90 seconds instead of 180.\n\n167\n00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.729\nHold down, we again change 180 to 90, and\n\n168\n00:09:06.729 --> 00:09:10.683\nthen the flush time here\nto 120 seconds as well.\n\n169\n00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:14.700\nSo that's what we just set up for\nthis particular router.\n\n170\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.804\nAll right, now, if we go to NYEDGE2,\n\n171\n00:09:17.804 --> 00:09:22.226\nwhich is the other router that\nwe are working with here,\n\n172\n00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:26.760\nlet's see if I can zoom back out and\nget a little bit more.\n\n173\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.188\nThere we go, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:34.155\nOn NYEDGE2, Make sure we can get in here.\n\n175\n00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:38.825\nWhat we want to see is, how does this\naffect the routing table over here?\n\n176\n00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:44.157\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that, show ip route.\n\n177\n00:09:44.157 --> 00:09:47.170\nAnd we're gonna specifically look for\nRIP routes here.\n\n178\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.904\nThen I'm going to pipe this in,\nand we're gonna do a begin, or b,\n\n179\n00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:55.044\nwe could do it for\nshort, and then Gateway.\n\n180\n00:09:57.401 --> 00:10:01.481\nAnd here you can see, and\nnotice the timer here, it says 7.\n\n181\n00:10:01.481 --> 00:10:04.755\nNow, if I actually had the ability to,\nlet me do it this way,\n\n182\n00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:06.628\ncuz this will make it faster here.\n\n183\n00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:11.942\nI'm gonna copy this,\nsee if I can paste it in here.\n\n184\n00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:16.807\nRun it again, and run it again, oops.\n\n185\n00:10:16.807 --> 00:10:20.603\nAnd you're now starting to\nsee what it's doing, right?\n\n186\n00:10:20.603 --> 00:10:23.773\nSo notice how quickly\nthe timer is actually going.\n\n187\n00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:25.271\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody seeing that?\n\n188\n00:10:25.271 --> 00:10:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n189\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.107\n&gt;&gt; I'm hoping that we can cat.\n\n190\n00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:31.860\nThere we go, we're getting close.\n\n191\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.196\nSo I wanted to get to this point where\nyou saw like 14, ideally 15, but 14.\n\n192\n00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:40.408\nAnd notice the next one, it went ahead and\nstarted the count again.\n\n193\n00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:43.175\nSo it was sending that every 15 seconds.\n\n194\n00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:45.950\nNow we're actually generating\nquite a bit of traffic.\n\n195\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.563\nSo we lose that.\n\n196\n00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:52.178\nThat's what can cause some other\nthings to happen here, too.\n\n197\n00:10:52.178 --> 00:10:55.580\nSo instead, our ideal here,\nbecause this, again,\n\n198\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.435\nmeans one side is updating much\nquicker than the other side,\n\n199\n00:10:59.435 --> 00:11:03.313\nwhich is what can also happen and\ncause routing loops, too.\n\n200\n00:11:03.313 --> 00:11:04.942\nSo let's change this one as well.\n\n201\n00:11:04.942 --> 00:11:07.032\nThat would give us another chance.\n\n202\n00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:13.183\nrouter rip, and then here, timers basic.\n\n203\n00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:19.392\nAnd we said 15 90 90, and then 120 here.\n\n204\n00:11:19.392 --> 00:11:22.388\nSo that's four different timers\nthat we saw under IP protocols.\n\n205\n00:11:22.388 --> 00:11:26.940\nThey're exactly in that same respective\norder as what we're seeing as well.\n\n206\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.991\nSo that will also help us to make\nsure that that happens, too.\n\n207\n00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.756\nAll right, so that's the idea.\n\n208\n00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:37.096\nMake sure that within your own autonomous\nsystem, if you're dealing with this and\n\n209\n00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.258\nyou're starting to see routing loops and\nstuff happen where\n\n210\n00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:44.164\none route is actually kind of in there,\nbut not in there at the same time, or\n\n211\n00:11:44.164 --> 00:11:48.628\none's staying around longer, get them back\nconfigured the way that you need to, and\n\n212\n00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:51.316\nthat will help out everything\nthat we need as well.\n\n213\n00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:54.798\nAll right, we need to talk about one other\nconcept here that we've gotta describe,\n\n214\n00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:57.005\ncuz it doesn't make sense\nfrom just looking at lab and\n\n215\n00:11:57.005 --> 00:11:58.350\nnot knowing what's happened.\n\n216\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n217\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:04.073\n&gt;&gt; Let me switch back over here,\nand then we'll get to this one.\n\n218\n00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:07.954\nRemember that by default,\nfrom what I described here,\n\n219\n00:12:07.954 --> 00:12:12.099\nRIP Version 2 is what we call\na classful routing protocol.\n\n220\n00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:12.923\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n221\n00:12:12.923 --> 00:12:16.272\n&gt;&gt; So RIP Version 2 just allows\nus to be able to use subnets.\n\n222\n00:12:16.272 --> 00:12:17.855\nIn other words,\nit added that component in there.\n\n223\n00:12:17.855 --> 00:12:20.769\nBut by default, it is still classful.\n\n224\n00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:23.652\nNow, the reason why\nthat's important is now,\n\n225\n00:12:23.652 --> 00:12:28.496\nZach, as we take a look at this network,\nthis is an entirely real possibility.\n\n226\n00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:32.474\nNotice to the left and to the right,\nto the left of Router 1,\n\n227\n00:12:32.474 --> 00:12:36.933\nto the right of Router 3,\nnotice that the networks are identical.\n\n228\n00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:40.712\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So 192.168.16.0 over here,\n\n229\n00:12:40.712 --> 00:12:44.672\n192.168.16 on the right of router 3.\n\n230\n00:12:44.672 --> 00:12:48.149\nThat's fine, because we're not\nactually on the same exact network and\n\n231\n00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:50.725\nwe can't have two networks\nthat are identical here.\n\n232\n00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:54.263\nBut at this particular point,\nthis is what starts to happen and\n\n233\n00:12:54.263 --> 00:12:56.413\nwhat we have to actually think about.\n\n234\n00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:59.518\nWhat happens if traffic\nenters into Router 2,\n\n235\n00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:03.409\nlike I have here at another\ninterface with the green arrow.\n\n236\n00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:04.264\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n237\n00:13:04.264 --> 00:13:08.571\nAnd it needs to go to 192.168.16.10.\n\n238\n00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:14.267\nThere's a possibility that that IP address\nexists over to the right of Router 3.\n\n239\n00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:18.319\nThere's a possibility that it exists\nover to the left of Router 1.\n\n240\n00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.817\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n241\n00:13:19.817 --> 00:13:21.697\n&gt;&gt; Well, what does that mean?\n\n242\n00:13:21.697 --> 00:13:26.389\nWhere does the traffic then go, Zach, if\nit actually has two possibilities to go?\n\n243\n00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.885\nThat's what we have to think about here.\n\n244\n00:13:28.885 --> 00:13:32.516\nSo in this instance, the routing table,\n\n245\n00:13:32.516 --> 00:13:38.340\nwhat it actually ends up seeing is\nsomething that looks like this.\n\n246\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.597\nSo now it goes into Router 2,\nthe frame and\n\n247\n00:13:42.597 --> 00:13:46.155\nthe packet here going to Router 2.\n\n248\n00:13:46.155 --> 00:13:46.689\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n249\n00:13:46.689 --> 00:13:50.625\n&gt;&gt; And it goes, hey, that's not to\neither one of these two addresses.\n\n250\n00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:55.400\nLet me take a look in the routing\ntable and see where I should send it.\n\n251\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.529\nSo when it actually takes a look here,\nthe first packet,\n\n252\n00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:04.274\nit may say, look,\nlet me send that out to gigabit 0/0/.\n\n253\n00:14:04.274 --> 00:14:07.775\nAnd then it'd get over to Router 1 and\nthen Router 1 will route it over here.\n\n254\n00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:08.565\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n255\n00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:09.830\n&gt;&gt; But what about the second packet?\n\n256\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.008\nIt is possible that the second\npacket end up arriving and\n\n257\n00:14:13.008 --> 00:14:14.905\nit ends up getting into this one.\n\n258\n00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:19.443\nBecause, well, they're both\nequal in terms of the metric, so\n\n259\n00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:23.825\nit could actually go to the other\ninterface and get over here.\n\n260\n00:14:23.825 --> 00:14:28.022\nWell, now essentially you have\nthis one stream of data, and\n\n261\n00:14:28.022 --> 00:14:31.824\nhalf is going one place,\nhalf is going to another one.\n\n262\n00:14:31.824 --> 00:14:32.567\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n263\n00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:38.078\n&gt;&gt; And this particular situation is\nwhat we call a discontiguous network.\n\n264\n00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:42.886\nDiscontiguous networks can't\nbe very easily helped when\n\n265\n00:14:42.886 --> 00:14:46.818\nyou're running a classful\nrouting protocol.\n\n266\n00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:50.429\nAnd the reason behind that is\nbecause it doesn't know what to do.\n\n267\n00:14:50.429 --> 00:14:55.676\nOn a Class C, it really only\nrecognizes the first three octets here.\n\n268\n00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:57.441\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And these are identical.\n\n269\n00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.321\nIt doesn't care that one's\nout of one interface and\n\n270\n00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:00.956\nthe other one's out of\nthe other interface.\n\n271\n00:15:00.956 --> 00:15:02.907\nIt just says they're identical,\nwhich means what?\n\n272\n00:15:02.907 --> 00:15:09.095\nIt should be able to go to either one,\nand it should route it to 192.168.16.10.\n\n273\n00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:13.446\nIf that machine exists over here and\nit possibly exists over here, as far as\n\n274\n00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:18.091\nthe IP addresses off of those networks,\nthat's perfectly fine with it, too.\n\n275\n00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:21.516\nSo what can we actually do here?\n\n276\n00:15:21.516 --> 00:15:25.768\nWell, this is where understanding and\nbeing able to also configure this to\n\n277\n00:15:25.768 --> 00:15:29.221\nmake it work a little bit better\nis going to help us out, too.\n\n278\n00:15:29.221 --> 00:15:32.884\nSo what we are going to do inside of our\nlab network is we're going to set up\n\n279\n00:15:32.884 --> 00:15:34.097\na situation like this.\n\n280\n00:15:34.097 --> 00:15:37.111\nBut we're going to do it off of one\nrouter, is what we're going to do.\n\n281\n00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:39.774\nSo over on NYEDGE1,\n\n282\n00:15:42.153 --> 00:15:47.488\nOn NYEDGE1 a little bit earlier,\nright at the beginning when we started\n\n283\n00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:52.911\ntaking a look at this in Part 2 of\nthe episode that we've been doing here,\n\n284\n00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.426\nwe set up a loopback address and\nwe turned it on.\n\n285\n00:15:56.426 --> 00:15:59.611\nThe 172.18 network.\n\n286\n00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:05.939\nOkay, so let's make sure that we can\nsee that show IP interface brief.\n\n287\n00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:12.044\nOops, I need to type again,\nshow ip interface brief.\n\n288\n00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:16.291\nNow, so there it is, right at the bottom.\n\n289\n00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:19.185\nWe're gonna create another\nloopback interface, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:20.430\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n291\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.123\nWhich, again to the router actually,\n\n292\n00:16:22.123 --> 00:16:25.778\nmeans two different networks is what we're\ngonna actually end up seeing it, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:32.410\nSo now, if I go ahead and do a configure\nterminal, and once I'm in here.\n\n294\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.594\nI can do interface loopback1,\n\n295\n00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:46.947\nip address 172.18.1.1 here.\n\n296\n00:16:46.947 --> 00:16:48.357\nIt's just an example.\n\n297\n00:16:53.892 --> 00:16:55.084\nI'll issue a no shutdown.\n\n298\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.823\nAnd lets see if that actually\ntook do show ip interface brief.\n\n299\n00:17:05.053 --> 00:17:06.450\nMake sure I can see that.\n\n300\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.274\nOkay, so now you see where both of\nthose addresses have been assigned.\n\n301\n00:17:10.274 --> 00:17:11.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n302\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.097\n&gt;&gt; They both have a 24-bit\nsubnet mask here.\n\n303\n00:17:14.097 --> 00:17:17.682\nSo when we see something like this,\nthat should actually work for us and\n\n304\n00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:18.896\ndo what we want it to do.\n\n305\n00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:22.402\nBut let's take a look\nat the routing table.\n\n306\n00:17:22.402 --> 00:17:24.281\nSo show ip route.\n\n307\n00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:29.107\nActually, we're gonna do\nthe running config first, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:29.107 --> 00:17:34.310\nshow running-configure here.\n\n309\n00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.496\nAnd then we're gonna do the piping again.\n\n310\n00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:37.305\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n311\n00:17:37.305 --> 00:17:43.810\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna tell it to\nbegin here with router rip.\n\n312\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.950\nRemember that that is case-sensitive.\n\n313\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.765\nSo if you try and spell it with capital R,\nit may not find it.\n\n314\n00:17:48.765 --> 00:17:56.270\nSo now notice it found router rip here and\nlook, Zach.\n\n315\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.970\nIt didn't actually add it in there, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.320\nSo it doesn't look like it's\nactually in there at all.\n\n317\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.428\nSo I don't see a 172.18.1.0, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:06.428 --> 00:18:09.610\nNow, you might go well, Ronnie,\nyou didn't add it in, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.911\nSo in this one, let's see what happens\nhere if I do something like that then.\n\n320\n00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:16.021\nOf course, why wouldn't it?\n\n321\n00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:18.983\nIt doesn't really wanna play with me,\ndoes it?\n\n322\n00:18:18.983 --> 00:18:24.028\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if I get into with this,\n\n323\n00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:28.610\nAnd I go to router rip.\n\n324\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:34.997\nAnd then I add in network 172.18.1.0,\n\n325\n00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:43.112\ndo show, running-config.\n\n326\n00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.278\nI misspelled running, of course.\n\n327\n00:18:54.278 --> 00:18:57.563\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It happens.\n\n328\n00:18:57.563 --> 00:18:59.132\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that happens to me quite often.\n\n329\n00:18:59.132 --> 00:19:06.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now look,\n\n330\n00:19:06.575 --> 00:19:10.582\neven after doing it that time, right,\nI added that into the routing protocol.\n\n331\n00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:11.209\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n332\n00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:15.620\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, it still didn't show up.\n\n333\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.790\n&gt;&gt; No, it didn't.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that is because why?\n\n334\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.840\nBy default, what did I say?\n\n335\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.868\nI said it's a classful routing protocol.\n\n336\n00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:27.723\n172.18 is a class B, which means it only\ntakes a look at the first two octets.\n\n337\n00:19:27.723 --> 00:19:31.263\n&gt;&gt; Octets, right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so really, only the idea of 172.\n\n338\n00:19:31.263 --> 00:19:33.308\nSo here, it actually only responds that.\n\n339\n00:19:33.308 --> 00:19:36.520\nSo it doesn't take a look\neven at the third one at all.\n\n340\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.705\nNot even close.\n\n341\n00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:41.030\nSo it just summarized them all in\nthis way, and that's what it does.\n\n342\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.640\nIt does auto summarization when you\nstart doing something like this.\n\n343\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.305\nSo once we have that, right, we do see\nthat it's in there as far as 172.18.\n\n344\n00:19:49.305 --> 00:19:53.011\nBut that doesn't help, it still says that\nit will allow it to go either way if we\n\n345\n00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:55.690\nchoose something like\nthis to be able to see.\n\n346\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:01.570\nSo instead, what we need to do is we need\nto change our router RIP configuration.\n\n347\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.350\nAnd I can see it right here under\nthe running-config, okay, for\n\n348\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.198\nright now is I am missing\na very important element.\n\n349\n00:20:09.198 --> 00:20:14.500\nBecause router RIP, or RIP itself,\ndoes automatic summarization.\n\n350\n00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.139\nIt took that smaller network, right, and\ncan added it in all the way up here and\n\n351\n00:20:19.139 --> 00:20:23.870\nsummarizes that class B, then the other\none that did the same thing here.\n\n352\n00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.560\nIt just says,\nwe're actually gonna report it as one.\n\n353\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.317\nBut the problem is it summarizes away\nit wanted to, which was along that\n\n354\n00:20:31.317 --> 00:20:36.485\nclassful boundary, okay, of those\nfirst 16 bits of the network address.\n\n355\n00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:39.810\nSo when we start seeing something\nlike that, I don't want that.\n\n356\n00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.074\nI want to be able to manually\nsummarize how I choose to.\n\n357\n00:20:43.074 --> 00:20:45.727\nSo I'm not gonna actually\ndo that right now, but\n\n358\n00:20:45.727 --> 00:20:49.430\nI need to take away its ability\nto automatically summarize, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.854\nSo that's what I need to do.\n\n360\n00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:57.120\nThat's just me thinking that I can\nactually work quickly with this,\n\n361\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.766\nand that's what happened there.\n\n362\n00:21:01.082 --> 00:21:04.708\nAll right, so the way that we do this,\nright, is a couple of things.\n\n363\n00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:09.979\nOkay, by default, auto is actually set,\nso that is what it's set up.\n\n364\n00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:16.933\nIt doesn't show it up in the configuration\nhere when it's on by default,\n\n365\n00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:22.215\nbut what I need to do is type\nin no auto-summary, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:25.354\nNow once I type in no auto-summary,\n\n367\n00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:30.980\nI am saying router RIP version 2,\ndo not summarize for me.\n\n368\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.428\nI'll do the summarization.\n\n369\n00:21:32.428 --> 00:21:35.335\nAnd if I do that,\nI'll manually enter it in myself.\n\n370\n00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:36.480\nSo that's what I'll do.\n\n371\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.585\nAnd believe it or not,\nthat's what you have to do, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:39.585 --> 00:21:42.834\nIf you let it summarize, it's always going\nto summarize by the way that it knows how,\n\n373\n00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:44.380\nwhich is by those classes.\n\n374\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.370\nAnd even though that can work for\nyou, it can also work against you,\n\n375\n00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.510\njust like it did here, by creating\nthose discontiguous networks, right?\n\n376\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.391\nSo now, let's see the same thing here.\n\n377\n00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:59.300\ndo show running-config.\n\n378\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.866\nAnd we'll do a shortcut here,\nan abbreviation for\n\n379\n00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:08.768\nbegin, and we'll do the same thing,\nrouter rip.\n\n380\n00:22:11.378 --> 00:22:14.294\nOops, let me see here.\n\n381\n00:22:14.294 --> 00:22:17.070\nWait, am I supposed to do that one?\n\n382\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.832\nNo, that's supposed to show ip route now.\n\n383\n00:22:18.832 --> 00:22:20.115\nSo that was my fault this time.\n\n384\n00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:22.769\nSo let's try it one more time here.\n\n385\n00:22:22.769 --> 00:22:25.845\nSo it's still summarizing,\nas far as the reporting goes, but\n\n386\n00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.360\nnow we have no auto-summary.\n\n387\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.385\nNow, it's supposed to show ip route.\n\n388\n00:22:30.385 --> 00:22:32.229\nDo show ip route.\n\n389\n00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:37.333\nAnd this time, we are going to do begin\n\n390\n00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:42.758\nGateway, Here.\n\n391\n00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:49.531\nAll right, so now when we take a look,\nyou'll see where both of\n\n392\n00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.960\nthem have now been reported\nseparately here too, okay?\n\n393\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.260\nNow once we get that,\nthat's perfectly fine, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.120\nBut I need to see what it\nlooks like on NYEDGE2.\n\n395\n00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.502\nSo here, they're directly connected.\n\n396\n00:23:02.502 --> 00:23:03.560\nSo they should show up.\n\n397\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.607\nBut what does it show up over\nhere on this side on NYEDGE2?\n\n398\n00:23:08.607 --> 00:23:12.314\nshow ip route,\n\n399\n00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:18.705\nbegin, Gateway.\n\n400\n00:23:22.433 --> 00:23:26.870\nNow notice that both of\nthem will actually show up.\n\n401\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.600\nIf I don't have that,\nonly the first one shows up, but\n\n402\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.390\nit shows up with two different interfaces.\n\n403\n00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.140\nNow, we didn't take a look\nat that right away.\n\n404\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.740\nBut overall though, you're actually seeing\nwhere it does seem a little bit confusing\n\n405\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.720\nwhen you take a look at it the way\nthat the LAN has it set up.\n\n406\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.590\nBut that's the term that they have.\n\n407\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.670\nBut now both of them\nare actually showing up,\n\n408\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.680\nwhich is what we want them to\nactually be doing as well, okay?\n\n409\n00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.271\nSo now we're taking care\nof discontiguous networks.\n\n410\n00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:58.105\nMy recommendation period, okay, and\nyou don't have to do it this way,\n\n411\n00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:02.007\nis that when you configure a RIP for\nanything and I mean it.\n\n412\n00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:06.460\nI always choose Rip version two,\nso router Rip version two.\n\n413\n00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.080\nAnd then I always type in no auto-summary,\nokay, automatically.\n\n414\n00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.380\nBecause I don't want Rip saying\nthat I'll summarize for you.\n\n415\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.080\nIf I want to summarize, then I will\nmanually create the summary and\n\n416\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.120\nenter it in there as well, okay?\n\n417\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.960\nSo that is something that\nI always just do because\n\n418\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.560\nthat's what you'll want to do as well,\nokay?\n\n419\n00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.630\nAll right, now there is a few minutes left\nwhich actually is just perfect enough time\n\n420\n00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.160\nto finish up what we need\nto in regards to Rip, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and do this.\n\n422\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.400\nNow let's go back over to NYEDGE1.\n\n423\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.360\nAnd remember that n,\nwhen we take a look at this routing table,\n\n424\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.690\nnotice it says,\na gateway of last resort here, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.540\nThat is not set.\n\n426\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.030\nThe gateway of last resort\nis not set up for us.\n\n427\n00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:58.332\nAnd now what we want to do is we wanna\nbegin setting up, of course, well,\n\n428\n00:24:58.332 --> 00:25:01.270\nthe idea here of that\ngateway of last resort or\n\n429\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.100\na default route is what we want here.\n\n430\n00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.810\nNow when we do so,\nthere's two ways we can do this.\n\n431\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.250\nWe can manually go in and\nwe can set it up statically,\n\n432\n00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.060\nwhich is what we'll have to do here.\n\n433\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.321\nBut I also wanna set it up for\nNYEDGE2, the other router.\n\n434\n00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:18.680\nSo I could go all the way over\nto NYEDGE2 and set it up again.\n\n435\n00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.169\nAnd then if I had another one that was\nout there, router three, router four,\n\n436\n00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:24.330\neach one I'd have to go in and\nset this thing up.\n\n437\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.040\nThe great thing is you and I know how\nto create a default route now, so\n\n438\n00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.350\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n439\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.153\nBut that's a lot of effort, and it's a lot\nof what we call administrative effort.\n\n440\n00:25:32.153 --> 00:25:34.880\nIf I have to do that for five,\nsix, seven, maybe ten routers,\n\n441\n00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.641\nthat's a lot of configuration, okay?\n\n442\n00:25:36.641 --> 00:25:37.404\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of time.\n\n443\n00:25:37.404 --> 00:25:42.650\n&gt;&gt; But we can get the default\nroute set up here and\n\n444\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:49.014\nthen have it essentially\nredistributed through Rip.\n\n445\n00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:56.270\nOkay, so let's verify on NYEDGE2\nagain just for a moment.\n\n446\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.620\nLet me see, okay?\n\n447\n00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.760\nJust wanna verify on NYEDGE2.\n\n448\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.240\nNotice that the gateway of last resort\nis also not set before us, okay?\n\n449\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:11.364\nSo now if I go back to NYEDGE1,\nWe can now zoom in.\n\n450\n00:26:11.364 --> 00:26:14.152\nAnd for us,\nwe're beginning to configure [INAUDIBLE].\n\n451\n00:26:14.152 --> 00:26:17.766\nI'm gonna set up a static\ndefault route here first.\n\n452\n00:26:17.766 --> 00:26:22.652\nSo I'm gonna do our configure terminal,\nand once I get in here,\n\n453\n00:26:22.652 --> 00:26:27.087\nwe're going to go into the interface\nat this point here and\n\n454\n00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:30.452\nwe're gonna turn on the interface, okay?\n\n455\n00:26:30.452 --> 00:26:37.532\nSo interface gigabits which\n\n456\n00:26:37.532 --> 00:26:44.612\nis gonna be gigabitethernet\n\n457\n00:26:44.612 --> 00:26:49.216\n0.1, oops.\n\n458\n00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:56.673\nInterface let's just do abbreviation\nhere to make it a little bit faster.\n\n459\n00:26:56.673 --> 00:27:02.349\nGive it a 0/1 ip address 172.15.0.1\n\n460\n00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:07.087\nwith a 24 bit subnet mask here, right?\n\n461\n00:27:07.087 --> 00:27:12.568\nNow we're gonna make sure\nit's on by a no shutdown.\n\n462\n00:27:12.568 --> 00:27:15.619\nAnd now on NYEDGE1,\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say,\n\n463\n00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:18.857\nhey, all of the routes that\nare not found in my routing table,\n\n464\n00:27:18.857 --> 00:27:22.530\nsend it out this interface\nthat I've just turned on.\n\n465\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.410\nSo let's do it.\n\n466\n00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.442\nNow I can do ip route and\n\n467\n00:27:26.442 --> 00:27:31.173\nwe did this during our static\nrouting configurations as well.\n\n468\n00:27:31.173 --> 00:27:34.509\nRemember that 0.0.0 and\nthese 8 zeros in a row?\n\n469\n00:27:34.509 --> 00:27:39.189\nThis is typical in how you actually\ncreate a default route as well.\n\n470\n00:27:39.189 --> 00:27:42.367\nThen 172.15.0.1.\n\n471\n00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:49.030\nIt's supposed to be 0.2, sorry.\n\n472\n00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.340\nSee that's what happens when I\ndon't look at the notes here.\n\n473\n00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.220\nI am lying to you.\n\n474\n00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.740\nThat should be the other router,\nthere we go.\n\n475\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.970\nOkay, so I can't do it to myself, okay?\n\n476\n00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:04.477\nSo now I'm setting up, it's gonna go to\nwhatever that next hop router actually is.\n\n477\n00:28:04.477 --> 00:28:06.396\nI don't even know what it is,\nso that's fine.\n\n478\n00:28:06.396 --> 00:28:10.828\nSo let's check it out, do show ip route.\n\n479\n00:28:14.378 --> 00:28:15.980\nAnd now let's take a look\nat the information.\n\n480\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.790\nAll right, now look and\nyou'll see a couple of changes.\n\n481\n00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.397\nThe first two are pretty much right here,\nokay?\n\n482\n00:28:23.397 --> 00:28:27.198\nSo notice gateway of last resort has\nnow been set for the default route.\n\n483\n00:28:27.198 --> 00:28:30.680\nAnd also notice an s and a asterisk, okay?\n\n484\n00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.080\nThe s asterisk means it's a candidate\nroute, but it's statically configured.\n\n485\n00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.820\nNow what is the candidate route about,\nokay?\n\n486\n00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.127\nIt is actually giving us this ability\nto take a look at it and say, hey,\n\n487\n00:28:42.127 --> 00:28:45.497\ndo we want to consider that\nas being the default route.\n\n488\n00:28:45.497 --> 00:28:47.994\nSo you can actually have\nanother one if you choose to,\n\n489\n00:28:47.994 --> 00:28:50.005\nut that's what that star is about, okay?\n\n490\n00:28:50.005 --> 00:28:55.570\nIs that is a possible candidate route for\nus to become that default route?\n\n491\n00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.190\nSo there it is.\n\n492\n00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:02.220\nNow that I've got this configured and\nready to go, okay, the problem that\n\n493\n00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:10.000\nI have is, well, Rip doesn't actually\nadvertise static routes for me, okay?\n\n494\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.140\nSo if I want this static route right here\n\n495\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.170\nto get sent into Rip, and\nthen to be distributed over to NYEDGE2,\n\n496\n00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:23.760\nI have to actually be able to\nredistribute this command, okay?\n\n497\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.860\nOr this particular interface here.\n\n498\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:31.260\nSo remember that this is called a default\ntype of route that we just did, right?\n\n499\n00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.216\nSo let's go into router rip here.\n\n500\n00:29:38.459 --> 00:29:43.515\nRouter rip and once I'm in here,\nokay, I want to go ahead and\n\n501\n00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:48.671\nwhat I want to do, right,\nis I want to actually say that this is\n\n502\n00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:53.847\ngonna be where default information\noriginates from, okay?\n\n503\n00:29:53.847 --> 00:29:59.126\nSo on this particular router, so\n\n504\n00:29:59.126 --> 00:30:04.217\nI type in default-information\n\n505\n00:30:04.217 --> 00:30:09.501\noriginate, right here, okay?\n\n506\n00:30:09.501 --> 00:30:10.323\nSo remember,\n\n507\n00:30:10.323 --> 00:30:15.140\nstatic routes they don't automatically\nget advertised by Rip itself.\n\n508\n00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.040\nThis is the configuration that says,\nany default information,\n\n509\n00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.565\nthat I have now set here, this is where\nit's gonna originate from into Rip.\n\n510\n00:30:23.565 --> 00:30:24.710\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n511\n00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's all we\nhave to do at that point, okay?\n\n512\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:33.600\nSo now that the routing tables, right,\nthey're exchanging the full routing table.\n\n513\n00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That includes now\n\n514\n00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.690\nthis default information\norginate which includes what?\n\n515\n00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:43.720\nWell, the default information, which for\nus is, well, right here, okay?\n\n516\n00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.440\nThat is default information for us.\n\n517\n00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.440\nSo if we go to NYEDGE2, I'm just gonna go\n\n518\n00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.670\ninto this mode here show ip route.\n\n519\n00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:00.880\nNow this may take a few seconds, so\nlet's see what happens here as we do so.\n\n520\n00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.290\nGood, it didn't actually take any\ntime at all, which is even better.\n\n521\n00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.970\nNow you can see where, Zach, you and\n\n522\n00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:15.450\nI did not configure this\n0.0.0 network at all, okay?\n\n523\n00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:20.110\nIt learned it from Rip and\nit also has the asterisk,\n\n524\n00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:26.050\nand then we take a look at the asterisk,\nit is a candidate default route.\n\n525\n00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:31.020\nSo it's saying, hey, I learned about this\ninformation because the other router\n\n526\n00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.430\nthat running it said this is where\nthe decode information originates from.\n\n527\n00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.320\nSo this is a possible\ncandidate default route.\n\n528\n00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.410\nAnd when I put that into route, notice\nwhat it also did which was set my gateway\n\n529\n00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:49.250\nand last resort at this point to go\nback to wherever it actually wanted to.\n\n530\n00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:54.300\nSo now it is actually part of\nthe Rip configuration to do so.\n\n531\n00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.720\nThis is what we call some\ntype of route redistribution.\n\n532\n00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This one just happens to be a default\n\n533\n00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.990\nroute redistribution.\n\n534\n00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:05.030\nFor those of you that wanna learn\nmore about route redistribution,\n\n535\n00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:09.210\nmake sure you continue to go\non to your CCNA routing and\n\n536\n00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.330\nswitching as well as the CCNP routing and\nswitching shows too.\n\n537\n00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.650\nAll that will give you more information on\nthe idea of actually redistributing other\n\n538\n00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.710\nrouting protocols as well as connecting\nroutes and different routes as well.\n\n539\n00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.930\nBut just remember that this is a part\nof what we're actually doing, okay?\n\n540\n00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.010\nSo everything is now set up.\n\n541\n00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:33.600\nYou've now seen kinda the basics of\nthe Rip version two configuration.\n\n542\n00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.720\nAnd we've gone through all those exam\nobjectives to make sure that we've covered\n\n543\n00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.610\nevery single one so\nthat we could actually show you all of it.\n\n544\n00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.385\nThe great thing is,\nit's built into your lab right here,\n\n545\n00:32:43.385 --> 00:32:45.430\nunder practice labs, our partner.\n\n546\n00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.370\nSo you'll be able to see how\nmuch you can configure each and\n\n547\n00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:52.300\nevery step of those exam objectives for\nyou as well, okay?\n\n548\n00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.650\nSo more practice is kinda\nthe key here at this point.\n\n549\n00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:59.770\nSo just keep on practicing and, Zach,\nthat will end our episode for us here.\n\n550\n00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.190\n&gt;&gt; Another fantastic job, Ronnie.\n\n551\n00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.170\nThank you so very much.\n\n552\n00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.500\nYou did such a great job.\n\n553\n00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.288\nConfigure Rip version two for\nipv4, this was part three,\n\n554\n00:33:07.288 --> 00:33:10.160\nmake sure you see part one and part two.\n\n555\n00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.320\nAnd before we leave and say bye bye,\nI think he wants to say something again.\n\n556\n00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so just kinda remember,\npractice, practice, practice is the key.\n\n557\n00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.570\nGetting the concepts down is very\nimportant in terms of the elements that we\n\n558\n00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.560\ntalked about.\n\n559\n00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.780\nBut practice is the only way for\nyou to see how it happens.\n\n560\n00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.040\nSo make sure you're in a router or\na switch every day from this point on and\n\n561\n00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.730\nthat you are trying to get faster\nat the configurations, okay?\n\n562\n00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.880\nSo that is the only way to build\nthe muscle memory that you'll need for\n\n563\n00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.820\nthe exam.\n\n564\n00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.440\nAnd that is a point I\ncannot emphasize any less.\n\n565\n00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.270\nYou have to actually be in\nit daily at this point.\n\n566\n00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:51.090\nAnd it has to become part of that,\nwhere it's a natural thing for\n\n567\n00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.710\nyou and it's not like, I can't believe\nI've got to get into the router.\n\n568\n00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.400\nYou've got to be excited about cuz\nthat's the way you're gonna learn more.\n\n569\n00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Great advice,\nthank you so much, Ronnie.\n\n570\n00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.700\nAnd make sure you see every\nsingle episode of Cisco CCENT.\n\n571\n00:34:03.700 -->

00:00:27.610\nAnd the person who's gonna do it for\nus, not me.\n\n11\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.310\nNo, no, no.\n\n12\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.740\nIt's gonna be Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.546\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Nice to be back here Zack as we\n\n14\n00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:34.487\ncontinue on.\n\n15\n00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:39.112\nAnd of course, getting ready for that\nCCENT exam and we're in our journey and\n\n16\n00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:41.320\nwe're heading into another topic or\n\n17\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.610\nanother domain where we're talking\nabout infrastructure services.\n\n18\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.700\nAnd that is really one of\nthe topics that we're covering.\n\n19\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.510\nWhich of course, is using what we\ncall DNS or domain name system.\n\n20\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.910\nOr depending on when you learn about it,\n\n21\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.948\nit may have actually kind of\ntransitioned into domain name service.\n\n22\n00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:00.970\nBoth of those still end up working so\n\n23\n00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.130\nyou may see both of them as you continue\non your preparations of different things.\n\n24\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.750\nBut overall though, let's make sure that\nwe understand what DNS actually is because\n\n25\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.080\nwe're gonna see that we rely upon it\nentirely today in our networking.\n\n26\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.010\nBut we're gonna rely on it\neven more into the future.\n\n27\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.698\nAnd the reason why is the transition over\nto IVP6, you're gonna find out something.\n\n28\n00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:30.380\nEven though you might remember\na few IP addresses like right now,\n\n29\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.625\nI know just about all of\nthe infrastructure devices right here at\n\n30\n00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.625\nITPro.TV by their IP addresses.\n\n31\n00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.135\nAnd the reason why is that with Nate and\n\n32\n00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:42.755\nmyself, we configured all\nof those devices manually.\n\n33\n00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:44.755\nSo I typed them in over and\nover again, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:47.895\nI know what those IP addresses\nare without having to think about them.\n\n35\n00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:52.655\nBut we've taken a look at IPV6, and\nthose addresses are not as easy for\n\n36\n00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:56.520\nme to memorize anymore\nbecause they're actually,\n\n37\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.190\nat least from my perspective,\na bit longer.\n\n38\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.300\nSo the reason why I'm actually emphasizing\nthat, is because what is easier for us to\n\n39\n00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.430\nmemorize is of course gonna be using names\nthat then can be resolved to IP address.\n\n40\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.070\nAnd they realize that in the earliest\ndays of internet as well and\n\n41\n00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.750\nthat's what end up happening too is\nthat people aren't gonna remember\n\n42\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.480\nevery single IP address\non the entire planet.\n\n43\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800\nBut they will remember what\nnames that are unique, and\n\n44\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.130\ngives you that ability to do so, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.825\nSo that's what we're talking about today,\nis we wanna understand that functionality.\n\n46\n00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:34.355\nYou wanna be able to describe at\nleast what that actually means and\n\n47\n00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.470\nthe way that it ends up working.\n\n48\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.720\nAnd then of course,\nwe're gonna configure this on a router\n\n49\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.350\nbecause it can be handled\non a router as well.\n\n50\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.440\nMost of the time, you may see that's not\ngonna be based on your router but here,\n\n51\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.570\nit's part of the exam objevtives, so we'll\nmake sure that we cover those as well.\n\n52\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.310\nSo let's start off by taking\na look at my screen here and\n\n53\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.010\nI've created a simple diagram to help us\nto understand this a little bit better.\n\n54\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.030\nSo remember that what we're\ntalking about here, right?\n\n55\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.350\nIs that we're gonna use what we call\nhere a protocol called DNS, okay,\n\n56\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.649\nDomain Name System.\n\n57\n00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.300\nAnd the overall goal is simple,\ntake a name that you're given, and\n\n58\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.590\nthen make sure that you known the IP\naddress that that name represents.\n\n59\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.300\nAnd that's important because that's\nthe way that computers communicate,\n\n60\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.980\nis by the IP addresses, so\n\n61\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.070\nthe very fact is the computer\ndoesn't need the idea of a name.\n\n62\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.610\nBut you and I as humans though,\nif we're gonna be communicating and\n\n63\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.510\nwe want to network traffic, to network\ndata across those different devices,\n\n64\n00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.870\nnames are probably gonna be easier for\nus to be able to do so.\n\n65\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.730\nSo I've actually created two examples\nof how this ends up working for us and\n\n66\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.090\nwe're gonna just describe the process and\nhow this ends up working.\n\n67\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.090\nAnd then we'll talk about how we set\nit up for either a router of course and\n\n68\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.720\nthen of course a DNS server briefly, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.560\nSo here's a couple of different\nways that it ends up working, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.440\nSo, let's not even take a look at\ntrying to get across to the Internet or\n\n71\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.630\nanything like that yet.\n\n72\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.780\nLet's just talk about within\nour own local area network or\n\n73\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.900\nmy own broadcast domain here.\n\n74\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.670\nSo on this side of the router,\ndown here as you see the lower and\n\n75\n00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.930\nthe left hand side here,\nI've got srv1.itpro.tv and\n\n76\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.490\nI've got this one I didn't label,\nbut let's just call this one PC1.\n\n77\n00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.190\nAnd then there's DNS1 right over here too,\nokay.\n\n78\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.040\nNow, if I do not have names that I can\nactually ping like this, Ping srv1.\n\n79\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.342\nWell, and I can't actually reach it,\nit's because I don't\n\n80\n00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:39.988\nhave any mechanism to link\nthat name to an IP address but\n\n81\n00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:45.149\nbuilt into your machines,\nyou do have that ability to do so.\n\n82\n00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:49.384\nSo they've implemented the protocol in\nthere and now you can take advantage of\n\n83\n00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:53.553\nthat so that way when you instead actually\nhave to try and find the IP address,\n\n84\n00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:57.915\nyou don't even have to know the IP address\nas long as you know the name because your\n\n85\n00:04:57.915 --> 00:04:59.040\ncomputer can do so.\n\n86\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.701\nSo let's understand this process of\nhow it resolves a host name to an IP\n\n87\n00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.230\naddress, okay.\n\n88\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.970\nSo let's say that right,\nokay, we ahead and\n\n89\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.010\nwe bring out our command prompt on our\nwindows machine just as an example.\n\n90\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.675\nAnd we issue out this ping srv1.\n\n91\n00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.670\nWell that's not pinging IP address, right?\n\n92\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.700\nThat's pinging a name.\n\n93\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.930\nAnd so\nnow the computer has to do one thing.\n\n94\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.910\nWhich is to look up with that name and\nthe IP address that's link to it or\n\n95\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.500\nmapped to that IP address,\neither way is fine.\n\n96\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.330\nBut this is the process that it does it,\nright?\n\n97\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.610\nSo when the computer starts to do this,\nit has to resolve as srv1 and\n\n98\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.980\nthere's two things that happen\non that local computer.\n\n99\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.580\nOne, it can actually end up looking for\na file inside of your own computer and\n\n100\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.960\nthat file is called the host file, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.650\nAnd that host file, all it's actually\ndesigned to do, right, is to make sure\n\n102\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.270\nthat we can actually list a bunch of well\nnames, and then the IP address next to it.\n\n103\n00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.120\nSo let me show you what I am talking\nright here, if I can get to that machine.\n\n104\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.550\nWell, we will come all the way over here,\nand this is inside of your practice labs,\n\n105\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.480\nand there's actually a machine there for\nus.\n\n106\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.540\nNow for me to be able to get access it,\n\n107\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.020\nI've gotta kind of do\na couple of things here.\n\n108\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.520\nI'm gonna use My Computer, and then we'll\nzoom in as we get the chance to here,\n\n109\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.995\nso that we can see it a little bit better.\n\n110\n00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So here it is.\n\n111\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.840\nI just clicked on My Computer,\nand now inside of My Computer,\n\n112\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.420\nI have all these folders.\n\n113\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.990\nI'm going to select Windows and\ndouble click on it.\n\n114\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.370\nAnd then inside of Windows here,\nI'm gonna scroll down, oops.\n\n115\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.146\nScroll too far, see if I can do\nthis without causing seizure here.\n\n116\n00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:51.051\nThere we go, a little bit easier for\nme to scroll down, and\n\n117\n00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:55.945\nI'm looking for a particular folder\nthat is called system 32, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:55.945 --> 00:06:59.310\nIt's right down here at\nthe bottom of the screen.\n\n119\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.980\nI'm going to go inside System32 and\nonce I'm inside System32, oops.\n\n120\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.230\nI scrolled down too far again, too fast.\n\n121\n00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:16.007\nSo here's what I'm looking for, is that\nthere is a folder called Drivers and\n\n122\n00:07:16.007 --> 00:07:21.340\ninside of Drivers, there's another\nfolder called etc, or etcetera, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.470\nSo however you pronounce it or\n\n124\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.990\nhowever you want to actually do it,\nthat's what we actually end up seeing.\n\n125\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.200\nAnd then inside of that notice that\nthere is a file up here called Host.\n\n126\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.092\nIf I right click on that file, and let's\nsee if I can actually open that file here.\n\n127\n00:07:37.092 --> 00:07:39.770\nI don't actually open it\nwith anything like that.\n\n128\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.840\nLet's see if I can open with here,\nand then let's just do Notepad.\n\n129\n00:07:45.222 --> 00:07:47.810\nAnd here's an example of\nwhat it actually looks up.\n\n130\n00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.407\nSo the beginning and\nthe procedural process to this, right,\n\n131\n00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:55.767\nis that your computer, when you decide\nyou're going to connect to another\n\n132\n00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:59.850\nmachine by name, it looks here first\nin this machine using Windows.\n\n133\n00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.816\nNow, all the other operating systems\nhave something very similar to this.\n\n134\n00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.854\nIt's actually the host file\nThat it looks up here.\n\n135\n00:08:05.854 --> 00:08:13.752\nSo notice the pound signs over\non the left hand side there.\n\n136\n00:08:13.752 --> 00:08:16.421\nI'm trying not to get, I minimized it.\n\n137\n00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:17.932\nThat makes it a little bit harder.\n\n138\n00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:21.151\nLet me bring that thing back up again,\ncuz I'm zoomed in, that's my fault.\n\n139\n00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:25.010\nI should have been a little\nbit more conscious of that.\n\n140\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.264\nAnd I'll bring it up again and\nthen we'll kind of see that, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:28.264 --> 00:08:32.056\nAll the ones with the pound signs\nover on the left hand side, well,\n\n142\n00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:33.420\nthat is commented out.\n\n143\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.967\nThat means it's not gonna\nmatter it's just there for\n\n144\n00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:37.956\nan example and to give us an explanation.\n\n145\n00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:40.839\nBut underneath that though, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.087\nWe have a couple of different\nones that are listed.\n\n147\n00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:48.005\nSo notice that they actually have,\nlike for example,\n\n148\n00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:51.370\nan IP address and\nthen a name for us, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.548\nSame thing, IP address and then a name.\n\n150\n00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:59.799\nSo when I wanted the ping\nsuch as the idea of SRV1,\n\n151\n00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:04.758\nif it found it here it would\nactually list the IP address and\n\n152\n00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:07.607\nthen of course, the name SRV1.\n\n153\n00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:12.459\nFrom there, my machine would have now\nbeen able to translate the SRV1 into\n\n154\n00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:15.924\nthe IP address and\nthen it would have went out there and\n\n155\n00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:19.255\nping on our network to give\nus that ability to do so.\n\n156\n00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:21.690\nBut what if it doesn't exist?\n\n157\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.750\nLike on this one,\n\n158\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.725\nit doesn't actually exist right\nthere in what we're looking at.\n\n159\n00:09:26.725 --> 00:09:30.477\nWell, if it doesn't exist,\nlet me go back to our screen over here and\n\n160\n00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:32.270\nzoom out for a moment.\n\n161\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.394\nThe next thing it looks for\nis what we call the DNS Server, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:39.680\nSo if it doesn't actually find it there,\nokay?\n\n163\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.909\nWell, then we actually\nhave to go somewhere else.\n\n164\n00:09:41.909 --> 00:09:45.520\nSo what happens is that,\non your machine then, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.658\nIt does a DNS Server lookup.\n\n166\n00:09:47.658 --> 00:09:50.430\nNow, even previous to the host table,\nright?\n\n167\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.501\nIt can look one other place,\nand I forgot to mention that.\n\n168\n00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:54.690\nLet me show you where else it can look,\nokay?\n\n169\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:00.605\nSo if I bring up now\nthe command prompt here, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:07.400\nI can type in, let's see,\n\n171\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.312\nipconfig displaydns.\n\n172\n00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:17.970\nAll right, now,\nthat's what we're looking for here, right?\n\n173\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.977\nAnd what we're seeing is what's\ncalled the DNS Resolver Cache and\n\n174\n00:10:20.977 --> 00:10:21.899\nthis is held in RAM.\n\n175\n00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.277\nWhen the computer reboots,\nthis will be cleared out.\n\n176\n00:10:24.277 --> 00:10:27.627\nBut if it doesn't find it here, that's\nwhen it goes to the host file and that's\n\n177\n00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.700\nkind of the step that I forgot to mention.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n178\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.802\n&gt;&gt; So it goes here but\n\n179\n00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:35.284\nonce it actually doesn't go and\nfind it here and then find the host file,\n\n180\n00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:40.130\nthen it will go out and it won't to\ntake a look in the server lookup here.\n\n181\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.165\nNow, how does it know\nwhere that DNS Server is?\n\n182\n00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:44.700\nThis one, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.256\nWell, the way that it knows where that\nis using this machine right here,\n\n184\n00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:51.076\nsee if I can do the same thing,\nlet me clear this out here.\n\n185\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.945\nIt is back up to the top so\nthat we can see it.\n\n186\n00:10:55.945 --> 00:11:00.168\nIf I do an ipconfig /all.\n\n187\n00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:04.618\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to be really slow now\nthat it kinda tricked me up just a little\n\n188\n00:11:04.618 --> 00:11:06.150\nbit there, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:13.900\nIf I do ipconfig /all I can begin to\ntake a look at some of the information,\n\n190\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.780\nwhich I am trying to find out right now,\nokay?\n\n191\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.192\nSo normally you actually see DNS\nservers listed, if they're right here.\n\n192\n00:11:24.192 --> 00:11:28.727\nBut this one doesn't look like it's\nactually listing any DNS server at all.\n\n193\n00:11:28.727 --> 00:11:32.578\nSo it can find it,\nif we were to do something like this.\n\n194\n00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:34.431\nSo we would have to configure to work and\n\n195\n00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:36.743\nI will show you that when\nwe get into lab setting.\n\n196\n00:11:36.743 --> 00:11:40.310\nI'm just using this to help us to\ndemonstrate what I am talking about, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.528\nSo it only as configured\non the Nic itself, so\n\n198\n00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:46.252\ninside of the network settings here.\n\n199\n00:11:46.252 --> 00:11:48.424\nThat's where we'd go and configure that.\n\n200\n00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:53.410\nNow, once it goes into that process,\nwhere it now\n\n201\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:58.537\nmakes a request here, or\na query on the DNS server.\n\n202\n00:11:58.537 --> 00:12:03.071\nIt will look in its own cache,\nand then it will look in its own\n\n203\n00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:07.539\ndatabase at that point,\nto find that matching for SRV1.\n\n204\n00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:12.390\nAnd the IP Address, and send that all\nthe way back to this one, PC1, down here.\n\n205\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.621\nAnd then, from that point, that ping will\nnow be allowed to connect through it,\n\n206\n00:12:16.621 --> 00:12:19.252\nactually drew a connection\nthat would help on it.\n\n207\n00:12:19.252 --> 00:12:23.750\nSo that's actually gonna be very difficult\nto connect without a line there.\n\n208\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.032\nSo if I actually drew\nthat connection there,\n\n209\n00:12:26.032 --> 00:12:28.201\nthen it would actually be able to connect.\n\n210\n00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:32.017\nAnd now we have that resolution of\nthat machine and we're ready to go.\n\n211\n00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:32.668\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n212\n00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:35.233\n&gt;&gt; So that process within the LAN is what\n\n213\n00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:38.240\nhappens every time you type in a name.\n\n214\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.520\nThe great thing is even through we showed\nyou an example where it doesn't actually\n\n215\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.758\nlook it up and it can't find it and\nthen it has to go and do that.\n\n216\n00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:48.907\nThat's the longest step and process and\nthat still takes milliseconds, right?\n\n217\n00:12:48.907 --> 00:12:49.683\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n218\n00:12:49.683 --> 00:12:51.547\n&gt;&gt; But if we already have it, so\n\n219\n00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:53.810\nthe second or third time, right?\n\n220\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.940\nWhen we ping SRV1, it's now going to\nbe in that cache, which is in RAM and\n\n221\n00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.830\nit doesn't have to go\nthrough the look up process.\n\n222\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.689\nIt can then go ahead and make that\nconnection because it's right there.\n\n223\n00:13:04.689 --> 00:13:09.180\nSo, once everything is built up it begins\nto work a bit more efficiently, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:15.583\nSo now let's say instead we choose to\ndo this a little bit differently, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:20.635\nWell now, let's say that we ping\nCisco.com or something like that.\n\n226\n00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:21.139\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:21.824\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n228\n00:13:21.824 --> 00:13:25.764\nif I ping Cisco.com as this example and\nwe look it up and\n\n229\n00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:31.432\nwe realize something is not in the\nresolver cache, it's not in the host file.\n\n230\n00:13:31.432 --> 00:13:35.480\nNow, it goes and looks it up in\nthe DNS server from my network.\n\n231\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.046\nWell, this server is responsible for\n\n232\n00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:41.180\nnulling about all of\nthe stuff inside of here.\n\n233\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.480\nBut, Cicso.com may reside somewhere\non the Internet, instead.\n\n234\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.059\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n235\n00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:50.460\nwell now how do we get\nthat resolution handled?\n\n236\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.523\nWell, when stuff like that happens, right?\n\n237\n00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:56.563\nOnce we go to the DNS server over here,\nwhen we can't find it in\n\n238\n00:13:56.563 --> 00:14:01.539\nthe resolver cache on my own machine,\nDNS lookup itself on the server here,\n\n239\n00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:04.840\nin the host table,\nexcuse me, it doesn't work.\n\n240\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.047\nAnd then we go to the DNS server, it will\nlook, and it will actually instead kind of\n\n241\n00:14:10.047 --> 00:14:15.187\nsay, hey, I don't have an entry like that,\nbut let me tell you of an IP address.\n\n242\n00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:19.700\nIn other words, another DNS server\nthat you can go on and ask.\n\n243\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.949\nAnd it will give an IP address that is\nsomewhere out on the Internet to do\n\n244\n00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:24.676\nso, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:24.676 --> 00:14:29.745\nNow, because of the names that we have,\nso let's just take this Cisco.com.\n\n246\n00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:35.904\nLet's say that there's a server\nout there called Web1.Cisco.com.\n\n247\n00:14:38.424 --> 00:14:42.468\nAs an example for what I'm talking about,\nmove that out of the way for\n\n248\n00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:43.620\nright now, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.983\nThis name is actually broken up\ninto a kind of hierarchical name.\n\n250\n00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:53.639\nAnd what I mean by that is that each\npart of this name helps us out in\n\n251\n00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:56.851\nresolving the name to an IP address, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:56.851 --> 00:15:00.520\nSo this is what is called an FQDN, okay?\n\n253\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.080\nAnd then FQDN stands for fully qualified-\n\n254\n00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:15.171\nFully Qualified Domain Name.\n\n255\n00:15:19.699 --> 00:15:23.549\nOkay, and\nwhat that actually means here, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:28.965\nWhen we actually type this\npingweb.cisco.com, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:28.965 --> 00:15:32.421\nI'll go ahead and do that,\npingweb1.cisco.com,\n\n258\n00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.208\njust as an example that\nwe can do right here.\n\n259\n00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:39.051\nWell, what now happens is when\nwe get to the Internet, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:44.044\nThere's a whole structure of DNS\nwhich I've tried to represent right\n\n261\n00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.002\nup there at the top, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:46.002 --> 00:15:46.580\nAnd oops,\n\n263\n00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.580\nlet's see if I can do this without\ngrabbing the entire sheet here, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.209\nSo, there's actually a structure of\nInternet servers that are just there for\n\n265\n00:15:56.209 --> 00:15:57.155\nDNS, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:57.155 --> 00:16:02.428\nAnd it works tremendously because it means\nI don't have to know what the IP address,\n\n267\n00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:05.844\nthe Cisco.com is, or\nto web server 1 on Cisco.com,\n\n268\n00:16:05.844 --> 00:16:07.869\nall I have to do is know the name.\n\n269\n00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:10.558\nIn this name lookup,\nthis is divided into, well,\n\n270\n00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:12.759\na couple of different parts here, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:15.275\nSo there are different pieces to this.\n\n272\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:24.609\nThe first component, To this, of course,\nis what we call the host name.\n\n273\n00:16:26.428 --> 00:16:28.950\nOkay, so that is the host name.\n\n274\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.130\nThat's actually the name of the machine\nthat we're trying to get to.\n\n275\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.520\nThen there is a second part of this,\n\n276\n00:16:37.873 --> 00:16:41.680\nWhich is gonna be, for us,\nwhat we call the domain.\n\n277\n00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.730\nSo hence fully qualified domain name.\n\n278\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.110\nAnd notice that each one of these sections\nis divided by this dot here, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.720\nSo you see a dot, so\nlet me see if I can zoom in so\n\n280\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.445\nthat we can see it, this dot, right?\n\n281\n00:16:56.445 --> 00:17:01.440\nweb.cisco.com, and then we have,\nwell, this third one here,\n\n282\n00:17:04.878 --> 00:17:06.786\nAs well, let me see if I can do that.\n\n283\n00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:14.957\nAnd this one right here, of course, is\nalso part of that DNS or that suffix here,\n\n284\n00:17:14.957 --> 00:17:19.950\nwhatever you want to call it here,\nthe .com, okay, the com here.\n\n285\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.912\nSo when you see something like that,\n\n286\n00:17:21.912 --> 00:17:23.940\nright, that means that it\nactually looks up something else.\n\n287\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.870\nAnd there's one more thing, which I\ndid not add in here that I need to.\n\n288\n00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:33.620\nNormally at the end of the name, there\nis also a trailing dot at the very end.\n\n289\n00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.770\nMost of the time when you and\nI look at it on our browser and\n\n290\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.170\neverything, it doesn't appear but\nit's actually right there.\n\n291\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.444\nAnd the reason why that's actually\nimportant is because of that trailing dot,\n\n292\n00:17:44.444 --> 00:17:48.523\nit resolves the name from the right hand\nside this name to the left hand side of\n\n293\n00:17:48.523 --> 00:17:49.193\nthis name.\n\n294\n00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:51.300\nNow, why is that important?\n\n295\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.690\nWell, just to give you again\na basic understanding.\n\n296\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.970\nWe're not getting super deep\ninto this in our show here, but\n\n297\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.900\nwhen it comes down to what we see It will\ntake a look name, those DNS servers.\n\n298\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.861\nAnd it will take a look at this entire\nfully qualified domain name and says,\n\n299\n00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:12.910\nI don't know anything about web1.cisco,\nokay, .com.\n\n300\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.410\nBut, I do know about about the dot.\n\n301\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.827\nAnd it will forward it to a server\nthat's actually named dot, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.970\nIt's called the root\nservers of the Internet,\n\n303\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.210\nthe DNS root servers of the Internet.\n\n304\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.900\nOnce it gets up to that root\nserver of the internet,\n\n305\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.610\nit will then take a look at the name again\nand then say hey, I don't know anything\n\n306\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:38.540\nabout web1.cisco here dot, but\nI do know of a com server.\n\n307\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.096\nAnd that's how it's divided up into what\nthey calling the top level domains there.\n\n308\n00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:48.490\nYou might see com, edu,\ngov, .mil, dot whatever.\n\n309\n00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.970\nAnd then even country\ncodes are up here as well.\n\n310\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:56.580\nBut for example like, itpro.tv,\nwell at the end of our particular\n\n311\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:02.880\nname there in that domain, well that's\nnot actually for us a commercial server.\n\n312\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.740\nBut what that actually is,\nis actually a country code for Tuvalu,\n\n313\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.319\nI think is what it's the country code for.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n314\n00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:09.890\n&gt;&gt; But because they're not really\n\n315\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.089\nusing it, they're willing to allow\ncompanies like us to go hey,\n\n316\n00:19:13.089 --> 00:19:17.380\nwe want to actually register our domain\nin that one, and you can do that as well.\n\n317\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.648\nSo for us, that's what it does, so it\nactually sends it on to that one server.\n\n318\n00:19:21.648 --> 00:19:24.990\nWell then that server for com,\nor all those servers for com.\n\n319\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.960\nCuz then it said, hey, I don't know about\nweb1, but I do have a listing here with\n\n320\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.640\nall of the other servers that\nare available, for a Cisco.\n\n321\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.850\nSo why don't you go and ask this guy,\nin this DNS server there.\n\n322\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:41.850\nAnd then inside of the Cisco server,\nokay, it will find the, well,\n\n323\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.790\nthe same thing that we just talked about.\n\n324\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.827\nA host name and an IP address, and then it\nwill return that all the way back down.\n\n325\n00:19:48.827 --> 00:19:51.906\nAnd eventually,\nit will get back to me very quickly, and\n\n326\n00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:55.720\nthen I will be able to issue that ping,\nand it will work, okay?\n\n327\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.160\nSo in those two instances, right,\n\n328\n00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.240\nthey're both really resolving that name\nto that IP address, and that's key.\n\n329\n00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.430\nMost of the time when you and\nI are dealing with it,\n\n330\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.940\nright, we're not dealing with\nchanging the internet DNS servers.\n\n331\n00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.970\nWe're dealing with, and\nwe're supposed to be managing,\n\n332\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.290\nour own DNS servers within our\nown administrative domain.\n\n333\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.130\nNow, Cisco, itself, right?\n\n334\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.710\nIt will allow you to use host\nnames instead of IP addresses.\n\n335\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.176\nJust about everything else that we've\ndone so far up in this point in time,\n\n336\n00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:27.783\nwe've used IP addresses, okay?\n\n337\n00:20:27.783 --> 00:20:30.560\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\n338\n00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.800\nOne, you've got to get used\nto typing IP addresses in\n\n339\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.440\nCisco LAN very quickly if you're going for\ncertification exams.\n\n340\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.650\nSo we don't issue out short cuts very\noften, I'm just saying well just let's\n\n341\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.250\ngo ahead and build this and then you don't\nworry about typing an IP address anymore.\n\n342\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.600\nWe want you to type in IP addresses,\nwe don't want that to ever go away,\n\n343\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.380\nbecause that's gonna be a part of it.\n\n344\n00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.850\nBut at the same time,\nthere's sometimes of course in production,\n\n345\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.680\nwhere it's gonna be easier if you set up\njust a little bit, and it makes it work.\n\n346\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.530\nSo let's talk about the basic\noperation again, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.890\nAnd then this will help\nus out a little bit more.\n\n348\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.150\nLet me see if I can scoot that\nup just a little bit here, okay?\n\n349\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.710\nThere's two basic ways that you and\n\n350\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:17.060\nI essentially can use DNS as\na service inside of our nodes, okay?\n\n351\n00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.560\nThe first one is what we talked\nabout even with the PC itself,\n\n352\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.300\nthere's what we call a host table.\n\n353\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.170\nYou can go to a router and\nyou can set up a host table.\n\n354\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.830\nJust in the same way that\na PC has that host file,\n\n355\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.890\nwell we can setup the host table\non a router to help us out.\n\n356\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.370\nNow, whenever we do that,\nwe're building a table\n\n357\n00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.990\nthat allows us to do the very same\nthing that I just talked about, okay?\n\n358\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.510\nBut the key here,\nif you're gonna use a host table,\n\n359\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.391\nis that it only works for\nthat router only.\n\n360\n00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:52.272\nThe host file on the individual\nPC only works on that PC, so\n\n361\n00:21:52.272 --> 00:21:55.640\nthis is the equivalent of that host file.\n\n362\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.260\nYou also have to manually configure\neverything that you want in there.\n\n363\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.970\nAnd over here on the right hand\nside I set up the syntax for\n\n364\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:08.020\nus to take a look at as an example,\nso the top is the generic syntax.\n\n365\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.512\nYou go in to of course the global\nconfiguration mode, and\n\n366\n00:22:11.512 --> 00:22:16.337\nthen you do IP host and then whatever\nthe host name is, and then the IP address.\n\n367\n00:22:16.337 --> 00:22:19.800\nNow in between you add a TCP\nport number if you want to, so\n\n368\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.136\nthat that way you can change it for\nwhatever you want.\n\n369\n00:22:23.136 --> 00:22:26.150\nBut usually,\ngenerically it's setup for port 23,\n\n370\n00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.384\nwhich is Telnet is what it's set up for.\n\n371\n00:22:28.384 --> 00:22:30.700\nBut overall though,\nthat's all you have to do.\n\n372\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.520\nAnd now it allow you to\nping SRV1 if you wanted to\n\n373\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.340\nfrom the host table right\nhere from the router\n\n374\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.000\nwithout having to even worry about\nwhat the IP address ever is, okay?\n\n375\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.710\nBut do remember that if you\nconfigure the host table by itself,\n\n376\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.814\nit's only gonna work for that one.\n\n377\n00:22:47.814 --> 00:22:50.839\nTraditionally inside of networks though,\n\n378\n00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:54.760\nyou can configure what\nwe call a DNS server.\n\n379\n00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.020\nNow most of the time\nin the realm of Cisco,\n\n380\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.400\nwe don't intend to actually bring up\nfull DNS servers on routers, okay?\n\n381\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.370\nSo usually, you depend on\nsome other server technology.\n\n382\n00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:06.950\nSo if you go, for\n\n383\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.100\nexample, the one that I'm most familiar\nwith is gonna be Microsoft Windows.\n\n384\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.950\nWell, if you can bring up\na Windows Server 2016,\n\n385\n00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.620\nyou can tell it, hey,\nI want to implement a DNS server.\n\n386\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.360\nAnd it will add those components in there,\nso that you can build a DNS server.\n\n387\n00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.940\nAnd now it can handle the name resolution\nIn the process like I described for\n\n388\n00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.910\nyou, okay?\n\n389\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.980\nSo you can build all that, and\nthat can actually be brought up.\n\n390\n00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.570\nWell, what is the difference here\nbetween well this DNS server idea and\n\n391\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.760\nthe host table?\n\n392\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.710\nWell, this DNS server can\nserve my entire network, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.039\nIt can actually be the centralized point\nthat if it's not on the host file,\n\n394\n00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.908\nto go ahead and look all that up.\n\n395\n00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:48.769\nWell on the host table itself,\nif you only do this, this guy\n\n396\n00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:52.849\nwill only resolve however many names\nyou've manually configured in there, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:57.626\nNow notice though, Zach,\nI also have added in a router up here,\n\n398\n00:23:57.626 --> 00:24:01.480\nand put also a DNS server\ninside of that too.\n\n399\n00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.265\nNow, what does that really mean?\n\n400\n00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:05.791\nWell this is what it really means.\n\n401\n00:24:05.791 --> 00:24:10.691\nWith the Cisco IOS, anything later than\n12.3 Cisco IOS that you're running on\n\n402\n00:24:10.691 --> 00:24:13.512\nwhatever model sever\nthat you're running on.\n\n403\n00:24:13.512 --> 00:24:18.330\nIn theory, in all practicality,\nyou can turn\n\n404\n00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.090\nthis into a fully functional DNS server,\nokay?\n\n405\n00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.610\nSo it will work that way But just when\nI say that, let me tell you something.\n\n406\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.680\nIt is not dynamically done.\n\n407\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.510\nWhat I mean by that is even\nthough it's a DNS server,\n\n408\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.480\nyou still have to actually\ndo manual entries into it.\n\n409\n00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.790\nSo it's not as dynamic.\n\n410\n00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.690\nIt doesn't function dynamically in\nthe way that servers are expected to,\n\n411\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.530\nin other words, automatically, right?\n\n412\n00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.200\nSo when you do something like that,\n\n413\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.810\nyou still have to do a lot of\nconfiguration to get it up and running.\n\n414\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.970\nNow, the difference also, of course, is\nthat it begins to build different records.\n\n415\n00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:59.930\nAnd you actually have to do this manually,\nif you're running this on the router.\n\n416\n00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.310\nInside of your DNS server,\nfor example, for\n\n417\n00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:06.220\nWindows, some of these records will\nstart appearing automatically.\n\n418\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.310\nOr when you bring them up, for\nexample, a mail exchange record.\n\n419\n00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.040\nIf you bring up, for example,\na Microsoft Exchange Server,\n\n420\n00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.217\nyou'll start adding in MX records\ninto your particular DNS server.\n\n421\n00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:21.480\nIt will ask you,\ndo you want to do this as well?\n\n422\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.450\nThen you can configure a host name or\n\n423\n00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.050\naliases if you want to as\nwell as reverse lookup.\n\n424\n00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.400\nSo let's say you have the IP address but\n\n425\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.060\nyou need to resolve the name,\nyou can add that in there as well, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.260\nThese are the most common records.\n\n427\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.470\nUsually within a single domain name,\n\n428\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.240\nthere's what we call the start of\nauthority which says, I am authoritative.\n\n429\n00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.160\nI'm the one you go to for\n\n430\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.090\nthe final answer here that's\ngonna be the correct answer here.\n\n431\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.110\nAnd then, of course, everybody that\nregisters and uses DNS, they're gonna\n\n432\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.990\nactually either have an A record, or\ntoday, an IP version 4, a quad A record.\n\n433\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.555\nThat list again,\nhost name to an IP address too.\n\n434\n00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:01.790\nBut all that is possible when\nyou get all that set up.\n\n435\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.840\nAnd then inside of the DNS server,\nit will start responding for\n\n436\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.190\nyou, is what we'll end up seeing.\n\n437\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.971\nSo it does help you to get the set up.\n\n438\n00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:14.677\nBut I wanted to talk about this cuz\nit's kind of a strange thing that\n\n439\n00:26:14.677 --> 00:26:18.596\nwe're doing here inside the labs\nat practicelabs.com here, okay?\n\n440\n00:26:18.596 --> 00:26:24.510\nThey have a setting up this full\nDNS server on a router, okay?\n\n441\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.500\nI don't wanna call it a word of warning,\nbut I did put this.\n\n442\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.248\nIf you turn this on on a router,\nokay, it's fairly simple to turn on,\n\n443\n00:26:33.248 --> 00:26:39.680\nyou can cause high CPU utilization\ndepending on the platform of your router.\n\n444\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.496\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\n\n445\n00:26:40.496 --> 00:26:45.120\nI'm hearing a cautious tone when you're\ntalking about running DNS on a router.\n\n446\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.990\nWhy is that?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n447\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.910\nthat's actually a good question here.\n\n448\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.191\nAnd I did do that on purpose cuz I wanted\nto remind myself that I needed to come\n\n449\n00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:53.611\nback cuz I kinda skipped there.\n\n450\n00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:57.130\nBut let's take a look at the diagram\nagain and this will help us out.\n\n451\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.320\nSo I did tell you that after 12.3,\n\n452\n00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.910\nyou can actually run a full\nDNS server on the router.\n\n453\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.757\nBut notice here I actually put here,\n\n454\n00:27:06.757 --> 00:27:11.096\nI should've actually put\nthe subject as well, it can cause,\n\n455\n00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:16.031\nthough, high CPU utilization\ndepending on the router's platform.\n\n456\n00:27:16.031 --> 00:27:18.320\nNow why the heck do you care?\n\n457\n00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.760\nWell, if you continue to\nrun the CPU at super high\n\n458\n00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.495\nutilization all the time,\nit can cause damage to the router, okay?\n\n459\n00:27:27.495 --> 00:27:32.300\nSo there's not a lot cuz I was\ntrying to see if anybody actually\n\n460\n00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.630\nran something like this on purpose.\n\n461\n00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.730\nI cannot find it as\ncommon as the way that,\n\n462\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.630\nI hate to say that our labs seems to go,\nyeah, this is how you do it all the time.\n\n463\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.176\nIt's not,\nit's not very common at all, okay?\n\n464\n00:27:45.176 --> 00:27:48.862\nSo you've gotta be careful\nout because your router,\n\n465\n00:27:48.862 --> 00:27:54.480\nif the perimeter device\nright between you and\n\n466\n00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.040\ngoing out to the Internet, remember that\nmeans all your traffic is doing that.\n\n467\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.070\nAnd that's a huge point, right?\n\n468\n00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.786\nAnd you don't want super high utilization\njust because you're running DNS.\n\n469\n00:28:04.786 --> 00:28:08.322\nAnd DNS, if every device inside\nof your network is using it and\n\n470\n00:28:08.322 --> 00:28:10.091\nresolving names all the time,\n\n471\n00:28:10.091 --> 00:28:15.060\nit shoots it up insanely here to the point\nwhere you can cause some breakdown.\n\n472\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.690\nSo you want to be careful and cognizant\nof the very fact that even though\n\n473\n00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:24.640\nit's possible, it doesn't mean it's\nyour best decision to choose to do that.\n\n474\n00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.330\nI mention that because our lab setup,\nlike I said here, really does tell us,\n\n475\n00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.510\nhey, we're gonna run it this way, okay?\n\n476\n00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.230\nSo they have it set up for that.\n\n477\n00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:39.303\nAnd it is possible, but it's not usually\nthe most common way that we would do it.\n\n478\n00:28:39.303 --> 00:28:42.926\nThe most common way is for us to set\nup our own DNS server and just have\n\n479\n00:28:42.926 --> 00:28:47.160\nthe router point to that and say it's\ngonna use the lookup to do that instead.\n\n480\n00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.270\nSo I do want to be cautious about\nthat as we actually get into our\n\n481\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.320\nlab setting here, okay?\n\n482\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.540\nSo Zach, now that we have just basic\nunderstanding, we wanna now see how we\n\n483\n00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.750\ncan configure this on a router, and do a\nlittle bit of troubleshooting as well and\n\n484\n00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.740\nconfirming that it is working\nthe way that we need it to, okay?\n\n485\n00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.650\nSo that is what we're gonna do next.\n\n486\n00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.570\nBut Zach, at this episode,\nat least for this episode, excuse me,\n\n487\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.240\nI should say,\nwe are ready to close this one out and\n\n488\n00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.810\nthen move on into our lab setting.\n&gt;&gt; Describe and\n\n489\n00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.550\nconfigure DNS on a router\npart two is on the way.\n\n490\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.854\nWe’ve seen part one, and\n\n491\n00:29:23.854 --> 00:29:27.300\nwatch it again because there was\na lot of valuable information here.\n\n492\n00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.119\nAnd Ronnie, before we go on,\nanything else you'd like to say?\n\n493\n00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:31.348\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, right now,\n\n494\n00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:34.950\nremember that these are,\nonce again, foundational things.\n\n495\n00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:40.010\nSo if you've gotten through this episode,\nand hopefully you have an understanding,\n\n496\n00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.300\nbut what we want you to\ntake some time as well.\n\n497\n00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.047\nMake sure that you\nunderstand this process.\n\n498\n00:29:44.047 --> 00:29:46.670\nThere's not a ton that\nyou have to understand.\n\n499\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.350\nBut at the same time,\nthis is gonna be more cognizant and\n\n500\n00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.526\nsomething that you have\nto keep on the radar.\n\n501\n00:29:51.526 --> 00:29:54.020\nBecause you're gonna be\ndepending on it more and more.\n\n502\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.360\nSo slow down, make sure you\nunderstand the concepts here too.\n\n503\n00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.590\nAnd don't forget practice every\nday on entering in router and\n\n504\n00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.860\nswtich configurations.\n&gt;&gt; Practice, practice, practice.\n\n505\n00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:03.630\nAnd also,\n\n506\n00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.500\nmake sure you watch every episode of Cisco\nCCENT that Ronnie's put together for you.\n\n507\n00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.760\nHe's put a lot of work into it, he's\ndone a great job, and it will help you.\n\n508\n00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.750\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\nwon't you?\n\n509\n00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.390\nAnd there's thousands\nof other videos there.\n\n510\n00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.325\nAnd they're designed to do one thing,\ntake you further.\n\n511\n00:30:17.325 --> 00:30:19.822\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n512\n00:30:19.822 --> 00:30:21.386\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n513\n00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.295\nThanks

going\nto learn stuff everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.813\nMy name is Zach Memos, and I'm your\nhost as we continue on with Cisco CCENT,\n\n7\n00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:26.940\nDescribe and\nConfigure DNS on a Router, Part Two.\n\n8\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.188\nSo let's find out what this is all about,\nRonnie Wong can help us out, Ronnie,\n\n9\n00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:31.566\ngood to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.988\nhaving me on the show as we continue\non taking a look more at some DNS\n\n11\n00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:37.600\nconfigurations that we have to deal with.\n\n12\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.946\nNow, of course,\nas we started talking about this, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:45.698\nNow we're not configuring a DNS server\nlike a Windows server DNS server,\n\n14\n00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:49.720\nwe're going to configure\na router to work as DNS for us.\n\n15\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.059\nBut remember that when we do this,\nthat the way that the interpretation was,\n\n16\n00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.945\nat least from the lab designers.\n\n17\n00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:00.689\nIs the very fact that they wanted\nus to configure a full service DNS\n\n18\n00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.900\nserver on that router.\n\n19\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.140\nAnd I just have to kind of warn you again,\nand\n\n20\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.148\nwe'll see if we can take a look at this.\n\n21\n00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:10.486\nBecause I've got to remember,\nI think it's show processes CPU,\n\n22\n00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.640\nto see if we can take a look at\nwhat ends up happening here.\n\n23\n00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.826\nBut we're going to be using, of course,\npractice labs to help us out, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:20.977\nSo the lab that we're doing\nis going to be configure and\n\n25\n00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:26.380\nverify DHCP and DNS as an introduction\nhere is what we're seeing.\n\n26\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.485\nSo this is what we'll actually\nbe taking a look at as well, so\n\n27\n00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:34.916\nyou can make sure that you follow\nalong with that as we go through.\n\n28\n00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:38.423\nWe're going to configure\nthat DNS server on NYEDGE1,\n\n29\n00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:41.410\nis where we're going to be configuring.\n\n30\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.782\nThis is one of those 2911 routers that\nwe have, that's connected, of course,\n\n31\n00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:46.961\nto the core switches.\n\n32\n00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.847\nAnd that's what we're going\nto be setting up, and\n\n33\n00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:52.700\nthen we'll be using our PC over here,\nokay?\n\n34\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.430\nOn the right hand side, to test out and\nverify that DNS is going to work.\n\n35\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.948\nWe've still got a little bit of\nconfiguration here that we'll have to do\n\n36\n00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:03.480\non this one too, but right now\neverything is set up for static IPs.\n\n37\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.579\nYou can see that DHCP is not enabled,\n\n38\n00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.795\nwhich we'll get into in a couple of\nepisodes from now or the next episode.\n\n39\n00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.856\nWe'll enable this and show you how\nthat works, but for right now,\n\n40\n00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:15.300\neverything has to be manually configured.\n\n41\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.626\nSo on NYEDGE1, let's go ahead and\nbegin our basic configuration here,\n\n42\n00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:25.310\nand let me zoom in a bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n43\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.671\nSo remember that in this\nbox here I get to type, but\n\n44\n00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:30.180\nI don't get to use some of the nice,\ncool features.\n\n45\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.975\nSuch as the up arrow to bring back\nthe history of what I've just typed in.\n\n46\n00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:36.221\nSo everything will be manually typed in,\n\n47\n00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.684\nwhich means you are going to get\nan eyeful, right, once again,\n\n48\n00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:42.494\nof my incredible typos.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:43.929\n&gt;&gt; In that path.\n\n50\n00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.047\nWe're just getting access\ninto privilege exec mode and\n\n51\n00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:50.290\nnow into the global\nconfiguration mode as well.\n\n52\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.172\nAnd once we're here, here's the setting\nthat we need to pay attention to, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:55.172 --> 00:03:00.870\nSo I'm going to do ip dns server, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.608\nNow when it accepts that command,\nthat is now turning on the full\n\n55\n00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:10.095\nDNS server capabilities that\nthis router can do and handle.\n\n56\n00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:15.150\nTraditionally, though,\nwe don't run DNS on a router itself.\n\n57\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.767\nBecause it is handling like all of\nthe traffic normally going in and\n\n58\n00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:20.327\nout of our network, right?\n\n59\n00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:23.613\nBetween us and the Internet\na lot of times, between us and\n\n60\n00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:29.010\nother networks that are out there, it's\nactually handling quite a bit of traffic.\n\n61\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.101\nSo can you do it?\n\n62\n00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.160\nYes, okay, theoretically, you can do it.\n\n63\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.141\nNow once we've turned the service on,\n\n64\n00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.732\nit doesn't mean that it's\nfully configured yet.\n\n65\n00:03:37.732 --> 00:03:41.761\nI now need to make this\nthe primary DNS server for\n\n66\n00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:44.800\nmy network if I'm going to do this.\n\n67\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.045\nSo the way that that works is IP DNS.\n\n68\n00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:50.098\nAnd then I'm going to\ndo a question mark so\n\n69\n00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:53.640\nthat we can see what other\noptions we have available, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.423\nSo the first one that we are going to do,\nokay, or the second command, right?\n\n71\n00:03:58.423 --> 00:04:02.078\nWe already enabled the DNS\nserver by doing, ip dns server,\n\n72\n00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:05.010\nwhich is the one that\nwe see right up here.\n\n73\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.984\nAnd now, we're going to configure\nthe primary DNS server for\n\n74\n00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:18.433\nour router here, ip dns primary,\nand now when I do this?\n\n75\n00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:22.420\nWell, what am I actually, what is\nthis going to be a primary for, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.305\nWell, this is actually going to be the,\nwhat we call the, why can't I remember it?\n\n77\n00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:32.830\nStartup authority, sheesh, the names of\nstuff that I can't remember here, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.295\nSo primary, this is going to be for\n\n79\n00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:43.387\npractice-labs.com, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:43.387 --> 00:04:49.030\nNow, we're going to create a record here\nby doing soa, for start of authority.\n\n81\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.224\nWhich means it's going to be\nresponsible for this entire zone here.\n\n82\n00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:56.380\nAnd then, we're going to tell it\nthe server to look it up to, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.155\nAnd I think this one they've actually\njust made up as a name here,\n\n84\n00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:08.678\nns1-practice-labs, here if I\nspelt practice right, .com, okay?\n\n85\n00:05:08.678 --> 00:05:13.342\nSo our start of authority is ns1,\nwhatever that may be here,\n\n86\n00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:17.480\nbut it is actually going to be for\nthis entire network.\n\n87\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.710\nAll right, so now,\nit says I have something else, I forgot,\n\n88\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.752\nI need another server up here,\nso that was my fault.\n\n89\n00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:28.480\nThere's one more that they\nalso added in here at the end.\n\n90\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.648\nWhich that's what I get for my notes\nnot looking down at the next line here.\n\n91\n00:05:33.648 --> 00:05:37.661\nThere's also another server out there, so\n\n92\n00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:43.532\nthe secondary server,\nwhich is mb1-practice-labs.com.\n\n93\n00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:47.365\nSo it requires two as we see it.\n\n94\n00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:50.821\nNow, this is something we haven't seen yet\nbefore, Zach, so this is a good place for\n\n95\n00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:52.075\nme to point this out.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n96\n00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:53.575\n&gt;&gt; Notice the prompt has\n\n97\n00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:58.081\nchanged just a little bit when we\nstarted to do this here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:58.081 --> 00:05:58.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n99\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.600\n&gt;&gt; Now you don't see it because of the way\n\n100\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.536\nthat this box down at the bottom, where\nit says type command for NYEDGE1 here.\n\n101\n00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:08.260\nYou don't see it, but if we were\ntyping directly into that router.\n\n102\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.266\nOnce it gets to the length that\nit can show on the screen,\n\n103\n00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:18.006\nwhat it does is it changes and adds in\nthis character right after the pound sign.\n\n104\n00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:18.847\nThe reason for\n\n105\n00:06:18.847 --> 00:06:24.030\nthat is it's telling you that the line is\ntoo long to be displayed on the screen.\n\n106\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.124\nSo it is passing\nthe beginning of the line,\n\n107\n00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:32.463\nessentially behind\nthe prompt that you see.\n\n108\n00:06:32.463 --> 00:06:35.301\nSo notice how it actually\nlooks like ce-labs, but\n\n109\n00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:37.220\nit really is all the way to the end.\n\n110\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.277\nAnd if I had access to that before I hit\nEnter, I could actually use my right and\n\n111\n00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:44.471\nleft arrows to scroll all the way\nback to the beginning line.\n\n112\n00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:47.533\nAnd then use the right arrow to\nscroll all the way over to the end of\n\n113\n00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:48.810\nthe line as well.\n\n114\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.598\nSo when you see something like that,\nokay, it's not because it's wrong, but\n\n115\n00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:57.043\nit's just because the line\nwas too long to be displayed.\n\n116\n00:06:57.043 --> 00:06:59.883\nSo that's something else that\nyou do end up seeing, so\n\n117\n00:06:59.883 --> 00:07:02.677\nit's something that we haven't seen yet\nin our lab.\n\n118\n00:07:02.677 --> 00:07:05.660\nSo I wanted to make sure that\nwe pointed that out, too, okay.\n\n119\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.102\nSo now that I've got that in there,\nwe now have created,\n\n120\n00:07:09.102 --> 00:07:13.565\nat least at the beginning here,\nthe configuration that we need, right?\n\n121\n00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:17.195\nWe've turned on the service,\nwe've now also said,\n\n122\n00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:21.520\nhere's where your primary\nDNS servers are going to be.\n\n123\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.293\nAnd at this point,\nyou think you're done, but you're not.\n\n124\n00:07:25.293 --> 00:07:28.519\nNow, because of the way that\nthis thing is set up, and\n\n125\n00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:32.240\nit's not set up to do a lot\nof dynamic entries for us.\n\n126\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.358\nWe also have to set up,\nessentially, the host table, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:35.358 --> 00:07:39.030\nWhich is what it looks up as\na primary database to help us.\n\n128\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.242\nSo the way that this works is,\nip host, and\n\n129\n00:07:43.242 --> 00:07:49.562\nthen we're going to actually just\nuse some generic terms here,\n\n130\n00:07:49.562 --> 00:07:54.144\nciscoserver 192.168.16.10.\n\n131\n00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:57.713\nNow in all reality right now, that 16.10,\n\n132\n00:07:57.713 --> 00:08:03.557\nthat is actually the IP to This machine\nthat we we're working with for testing.\n\n133\n00:08:03.557 --> 00:08:06.260\nBut I can set up any name I want to.\n\n134\n00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.020\nIf I ping that name, in theory,\nthis is the address it will go to, and\n\n135\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.020\nit will respond for that.\n\n136\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.530\nSo it can actually allow us to do that.\n\n137\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.550\nNow, normally, this is by far one of\nthe most important records that we have.\n\n138\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.600\nIt's usually the only one in the list of\ndatabases records that we've talked about,\n\n139\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.100\nright here, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.300\nSo in this type of list here,\n\n141\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.515\nit's the only one that matches\nup to a name to the IP address.\n\n142\n00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:35.834\nThe rest of them will tell you\nwhat the name of it is, right?\n\n143\n00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:41.302\nAnd even a CNAME is just an alias that\nlinks up to the A record as well, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:41.302 --> 00:08:44.437\nAnd NS,\nit actually tells you the name of that.\n\n145\n00:08:44.437 --> 00:08:48.072\nBut it all ends up looking up\nto this A record at some point.\n\n146\n00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:53.035\nOr if you're actually looking at IPv6,\nthey call it a quad A-record, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:57.901\nSo that is by far the most important\nrecord that we can actually set up,\n\n148\n00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.560\nis right there, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:07.899\nWe're gonna do one more\nname here as an example.\n\n150\n00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:13.347\nSo ip host, and\nthen ns1_practice-labs.com,\n\n151\n00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:16.577\n192.168.16.1.\n\n152\n00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:21.709\nOkay, now in this one, right,\n\n153\n00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:26.965\npracticens1practise-labs.com, okay?\n\n154\n00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:32.006\nThe 16.1 is actually to\nthis router itself, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:37.820\nSo this router,\nits IP address is 192.168.16.1.\n\n156\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.298\nSo right here, when we set up\nthe primary DNS, practice-labs.com, and\n\n157\n00:09:42.298 --> 00:09:46.710\nwe pointed the start of authority\nto being essentially itself, right?\n\n158\n00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.370\nDidn't need to do that,\nwhatever I did there.\n\n159\n00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.580\nSo it's pointing to itself, it's gonna\nlook up in it's own host table here, and\n\n160\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.070\nit's gonna say, all right,\nthat 16.1, which is me.\n\n161\n00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.460\nSo it has the ability to look in this\nhost table and answer record, or\n\n162\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.350\nanswer a query request,\nthat we have for us, okay?\n\n163\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.090\nSo when we do that, right,\nthen it's pretty much done.\n\n164\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.570\nNow, this is our DNS server, and it should\nwork like a DNS server for our network,\n\n165\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.580\nwhere I can now go to the other machine,\nthe practice lab's workstation\n\n166\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:25.110\nthat we have, and point it to this guy,\nand it should work as our DNS server.\n\n167\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.700\nNow, let me talk about, traditionally,\nthe way that we normally use DNS\n\n168\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.070\non our router instead, Zach, cuz that's\nactually probably a lot more common, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:43.500\nSo on a router, if we just had\nactually left off IP DNS server, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.250\nAnd as well as the IP DNS Primary,\nand the rest of that stuff,\n\n171\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:53.780\nwe could still enter in this, and\n\n172\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.220\nthis, and create the host table\nthat I was talking about.\n\n173\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:05.460\nThis will allow me from router or\nNYEDGE here, NYEDGE1, to be able\n\n174\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.145\nto do something like ping Cisco server,\nand it would look it up here, okay?\n\n175\n00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:14.150\nAnd I can ping ns1.practicelabs.com,\nand in theory,\n\n176\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.120\nit would actually look it up here,\nand do the same thing, okay?\n\n177\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.600\nSo I can actually do both of them.\n\n178\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.580\nBut when I do the IP DNS server,\nand then the primary,\n\n179\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.310\nI'm setting this up to be\nthe primary DNA server.\n\n180\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.490\nAnd once I do that, right,\nit will handle it on,\n\n181\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.750\nand it should be able to distribute that\nout, and other machines can use this, too.\n\n182\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.750\nNow, I don't know, because I haven't\nrun this one before on this lab here,\n\n183\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.880\nbut I wanna see if I can check out\nthe CPU utilization just briefly.\n\n184\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.213\nSo this is just me adding in a step that's\nnot gonna be in your practice lab steps\n\n185\n00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:48.010\nhere, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:53.607\nSo if I do a show processes cpu, okay?\n\n187\n00:11:53.607 --> 00:11:58.380\nSo I wanna see if this particular\nutilization is hot, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.370\nBut it's not so far.\n\n189\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.590\nSo I can see that right now,\nthis one looks like it's optimized for it,\n\n190\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.660\nwhich is good.\n\n191\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.250\nBut on older routers, you might have seen\nthis where the CPU utilization drove\n\n192\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.640\nit all the way up to 99 or\n100%, and it was constant.\n\n193\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.450\nAnd that's where things can begin\nto break, if you're having a very,\n\n194\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.130\nvery busy net.\n\n195\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.400\nThere we go, okay?\n\n196\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.770\nSo this is a little bit beyond\nwhat we're taking a look at,\n\n197\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.800\nbut I'm trying to see\nwhat the utilization is.\n\n198\n00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.440\nSo there's not a lot, which is great.\n\n199\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.100\nSo even though we're a minute's time,\nbut if you start to do this on an older\n\n200\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.480\nrouter, and you're starting to see,\nwell, like 100% constantly\n\n201\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.200\nacross the board here on some of this\nstuff, it's probably not a good idea.\n\n202\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.240\nEspecially if you see it across five\nseconds, five minutes, one minute here,\n\n203\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.184\nthat means your CPU is getting taxed.\n\n204\n00:12:45.184 --> 00:12:47.270\nReally, really difficult, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.660\nAnd it's having a hard time running.\n\n206\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.950\nSo I just need to be get through to\nthe end of this and see what we can do.\n\n207\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.203\nAnd you'll see that there's a lot of\ndifferent things going on on that\n\n208\n00:12:58.203 --> 00:12:59.220\nparticular.\n\n209\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.990\nBut it doesn't look like it's\nactually hurting at any.\n\n210\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.545\nSo that's pretty good when\nwe start seeing it, okay?\n\n211\n00:13:04.545 --> 00:13:07.380\nSo let me see, can I do a Ctrl+C here,\nand press Enter?\n\n212\n00:13:08.775 --> 00:13:12.260\n[INAUDIBLE] looks like I'm going to\nhave to just let it ride out all of\n\n213\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.410\nthe thousands of processes that\nit's actually doing it, okay?\n\n214\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.960\nSo it doesn't give me that ability to\nrun those shortcut commands that can\n\n215\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.250\nnormally save us here.\n\n216\n00:13:23.898 --> 00:13:24.735\nThere we go.\n\n217\n00:13:24.735 --> 00:13:25.705\nOkay, so finally, at the end.\n\n218\n00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:27.300\nBut it looks like it's handling it.\n\n219\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.780\nSo that's good sign for you and\nme in terms of this router.\n\n220\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.080\nSo on this one,\nit may handle it perfectly fine, and\n\n221\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.900\nthat's all that we have to do, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.520\nSo let's go ahead and now see what we\ncan set up here to help us out as well.\n\n223\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.430\nOkay, so I need to go over\nto that practice machine.\n\n224\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.960\nAnd it's here.\n\n225\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.510\nLet me zoom out just a tad bit here, so\n\n226\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.720\nthat we can change a couple of things,\nokay?\n\n227\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.095\nThe first thing I need to do is I need\nto add a DNS server to this machine.\n\n228\n00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.790\nAll right, so that is what I must do here.\n\n229\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.400\nSo I need to get access\nto actually the bar here.\n\n230\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.860\nSo let me do that.\n\n231\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.930\nLet me see if I can zoom out for a moment.\n\n232\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.000\nNow, I'm zooming down so\nI can get access to the Start button here,\n\n233\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.370\nis what I'm trying to do as well.\n\n234\n00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.975\nAnd actually,\nto the network configuration.\n\n235\n00:14:18.975 --> 00:14:21.660\nRight-click and go to Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n236\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.707\nAnd I'll zoom back here in just\na moment so that we can see it, okay?\n\n237\n00:14:25.707 --> 00:14:26.680\nSo fairly common.\n\n238\n00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.150\nI'm not gonna change the one\nthat says do not change.\n\n239\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.404\nThat's the bad thing, okay?\n\n240\n00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:33.720\nSo I'm gonna select the Lab Nic.\n\n241\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.590\nAnd inside of the Lab Nic status here,\nat least I'm gonna try.\n\n242\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.250\nI need to get in to Properties.\n\n243\n00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:46.161\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna select IP Protocol Version 4.\n\n244\n00:14:46.161 --> 00:14:48.600\nNot Install, I need Properties here.\n\n245\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.710\nIP Version 4 &gt; Properties.\n\n246\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.350\nI don't know what I was gonna install,\nbut I was gonna try it somehow.\n\n247\n00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.830\nAnd you'll see that right now,\neverything has actually set to static.\n\n248\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.450\nBut notice I don't have any\nDNS server set to static.\n\n249\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.720\nSo I'm gonna set this to\nthe DNS server that you and\n\n250\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.750\nI just configured, okay,\nwhich is gonna be that one.\n\n251\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.780\nNow, the other thing that I'm going\nto do is I'm going to configure\n\n252\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.540\nthe DNS suffix name here.\n\n253\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:21.270\nI'm gonna click on the Advanced tab,\nand then select the DNS tab here.\n\n254\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:27.830\nAnd now, under Append these suffixes,\nif I am right here, make sure I do that.\n\n255\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.290\nActually, only I have to do DNS suffix for\nthis connection, I believe, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:39.798\nAnd this gonna be practice-labs.com\n\n257\n00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:45.311\nAnd there's something else\nthat you can kind of see,\n\n258\n00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.500\nit's a little bit distorted\nnow that I'm zoomed in.\n\n259\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.710\nBut notice where it says\nRegister this DNS address in, or\n\n260\n00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.420\nRegister this connection's address in DNS.\n\n261\n00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.585\nSo this is saying, hey, go ahead and\nmake a DNS record for me, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:58.585 --> 00:16:00.391\nSo that's pretty darn cool.\n\n263\n00:16:00.391 --> 00:16:02.153\nTo be able to do that if you wanted to.\n\n264\n00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:06.039\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna click OK there, and\n\n265\n00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:08.730\nthe click OK again, click Close.\n\n266\n00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:16.574\nAnd now we are back out to our,\nso our setting there.\n\n267\n00:16:16.574 --> 00:16:21.600\nAll right, so now that we've got\nthe DNS server set up that way.\n\n268\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.030\nAnd we've now configured this to look for\nthat DNS server.\n\n269\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.590\nI should be able to go to\nthe command prompt here, and\n\n270\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.650\nlet's start issuing out a couple of\ndifferent things that we want to do.\n\n271\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.190\nSo how do we test out if this\nworking the way that we want to?\n\n272\n00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.480\nWell, there's a couple of commands that\nhelp us out, but at the beginning here,\n\n273\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:48.310\nI'm just gonna use a tool that's\ncalled nslookup, and press Enter.\n\n274\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.150\nNotice what it did right away now,\nnslookup, it returned to me and\n\n275\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.000\nsaid the default DNS server,\nlook at that, is the name that you and\n\n276\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.010\nI typed into the router\nas well the IP address.\n\n277\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.870\nSo I didn't actually have\nto type in ns1 at all.\n\n278\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.510\nIt was able to look it up,\nnslookup for name server look up, and\n\n279\n00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.100\nit found that particular record,\nwhich is fun.\n\n280\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.250\nNow, let's also see if we can find the\nother record that we put into the router,\n\n281\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.515\nif you remember, that one was ciscoserver.\n\n282\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.200\nSo when you start to see this.\n\n283\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.080\nNow this is a little bit more\nunusual here in this sense.\n\n284\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.420\nIt actually shows us something\nI wasn't expecting to see.\n\n285\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:39.475\nNow, the first two lines here that\nyou see where it says server,\n\n286\n00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:45.600\nns1.practice-labs.com, that is\nthe server it is supposed to look up.\n\n287\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.220\nAnd when you and I set up SOA for\nstart of authority,\n\n288\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.180\nthat meant that it returns\nan authoritative answer to you and me.\n\n289\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.740\nNow, the reason why I'm actually\nkind of puzzled by this is that\n\n290\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.540\nit actually says it got\na non-authoritative answer to this.\n\n291\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.545\nAnd when you get a non-authoritative\nanswer, from an authoritative server,\n\n292\n00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:14.525\nit's saying, I found it, but\nsomewhere else besides this got.\n\n293\n00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:18.241\nWhich it might be that it got cached,\nat some point,\n\n294\n00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:22.983\ninside of the DNS server,\nsomewhere else that it actually did it.\n\n295\n00:18:22.983 --> 00:18:26.710\nBut it's saying it didn't come from here,\nwhich is strange cuz we set it up.\n\n296\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.340\nSo, usually what you all should see is\njust answer here that says authoritative\n\n297\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.860\nanswer, and it will give you the answer\nthat you see right here as well.\n\n298\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.430\nSo, that's what you will also end up\nseeing a lot of times if you do that.\n\n299\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.240\nSo now if I try this,\nlet me exit out of that.\n\n300\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.010\nAnd now if I try and ping, let's say ns1.\n\n301\n00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:50.180\nSee what it does for us here.\n\n302\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.700\nNotice it responds back for us.\n\n303\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.810\nSo let me zoom out a little bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n304\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.170\nSo I didn't have to enter\nthe IP address at all.\n\n305\n00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:06.590\nIt clearly went ahead, and\nit was able to resolve the name.\n\n306\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:12.440\nIt actually not only took this, but\nit appended what practice-labs.com to it.\n\n307\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.170\nIt was able to go and\nfind the IP address from that, and\n\n308\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.260\nthen it actually replied back for us here.\n\n309\n00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.430\nSo that is something else that we can do.\n\n310\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.080\nNow let's go to the other side here.\n\n311\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.610\nLet me get back to NYEDGE1 here, and\nlet me zoom back in just briefly.\n\n312\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.916\nI know that's probably a little bit\nmore daunting at the zoom I was doing,\n\n313\n00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:39.793\nbut I can use my zoom right here on\nmy trusty computer to kind of help us\n\n314\n00:19:39.793 --> 00:19:41.868\nto zoom in a little bit more.\n\n315\n00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:50.310\nSo I should be able to ping ciscoserver,\njust like this.\n\n316\n00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.600\nAnd now notice it actually did go ahead,\n\n317\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.700\nit pinged ciscoserver, and\nknew how to look that up.\n\n318\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.100\nAnd it also ended up going\nto the right IP address and\n\n319\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.540\nreturning the answer back to us.\n\n320\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.440\nSo that's something else that\nwe can use to help us to verify\n\n321\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.220\nthat DNS is operational\nin using the server.\n\n322\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.320\nSo it actually does work, it's actually\nworking well for us right now.\n\n323\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.140\nNow, what are some of the other things\nthat I might check if I'm suspecting that\n\n324\n00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.420\nthere's something wrong?\n\n325\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.280\nWell, let me go ahead and type in\na couple of commands here on the router.\n\n326\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.280\nI wanna go into my show\nrunning-config here.\n\n327\n00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.940\nAnd as I scroll through this,\nI'm really starting to look for\n\n328\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.220\na few different things.\n\n329\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.950\nRight here is kind of a key part of it,\n\n330\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:45.650\nthe very fact that I'm seeing the host\ntable listed is a good thing.\n\n331\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.970\nWe wanna make sure that we\nalso have that setup as well.\n\n332\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:54.000\nNow the other thing that should actually\nhelp us here, which is kinda surprising,\n\n333\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.880\nand this is off by default right now,\nwhich is no ip domain lookup.\n\n334\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.230\nNow this one, normally is on by default,\nis what this one actually is.\n\n335\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.131\nSo and I will show you what that one\nactually means when I get out of this for\n\n336\n00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.210\na moment here.\n\n337\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.640\nSo we'll do that here.\n\n338\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.660\nMe hitting the wrong button.\n\n339\n00:21:15.973 --> 00:21:17.960\nThinking that I'm hitting the right one.\n\n340\n00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.190\nSo there we go.\n\n341\n00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.740\nThat's actually kinda one of the primary\nones that we're looking for,\n\n342\n00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.520\nespecially with DNS.\n\n343\n00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.730\nBut now let's do this.\n\n344\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.610\nAll right, Zach,\nif I type in your name just like this,\n\n345\n00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.094\nlook at what it says\nhere Translating Zach.\n\n346\n00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:38.920\nWhat is it trying to do?\n\n347\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.760\nWell it's trying to use DNS,\nso by default,\n\n348\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.430\nthe router itself if trying to\nactually translate your name,\n\n349\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.938\nZach, into an IP address.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n350\n00:21:48.938 --> 00:21:52.077\nit's reaching out to the Internet to see\nif there actually is an address like\n\n351\n00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:54.635\nthat?\n&gt;&gt; No, remember it's actually reaching out\n\n352\n00:21:54.635 --> 00:21:58.220\nto itself first, and then it reaches\nout to A DNS server somewhere.\n\n353\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.530\nIt's trying, so\nwhat it's trying to do is do that.\n\n354\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.190\nNow, usually it takes a bit\nof time to do this, so\n\n355\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.270\nin between you might see where it actually\ndoes take a couple of minutes here\n\n356\n00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.860\nbefore you can actually let that go, and\nthat can be a waste of time as well.\n\n357\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.910\nBut looking at the info, oops I'm\nshocked that that didn't scroll me.\n\n358\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.990\nThat IP address or\nhost name is saying look I tried,\n\n359\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.380\neither this host name doesn't exist or\nthe IP address for it doesn't exist.\n\n360\n00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.589\nUnknown command or\n\n361\n00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:32.884\ncomputer name unable to find this because\nit's trying to actually use DNS to do so.\n\n362\n00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:37.757\nWell that command that I showed\nyou way up here in the list is\n\n363\n00:22:37.757 --> 00:22:42.944\nusually that happens when we have\nIP domain look up turned on.\n\n364\n00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:45.220\nBut this one says no lookup, and\n\n365\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.870\nwhat it did is it actually just\nkind of tried to resolve it.\n\n366\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.690\nAnd when it didn't do it,\nit just failed right away, which is fine..\n\n367\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.650\nNow I can do this,\nI can turn it back on, but if we do it\n\n368\n00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.590\nit might actually lock up the router\nhere for let's say 30 seconds to two,\n\n369\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.110\nthree minutes.\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n370\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Before it actually recieves it.\n\n371\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.770\nWell, because it's having to\ngo through all the process and\n\n372\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:04.720\nsteps.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n373\n00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.180\n&gt;&gt; It looks at its own cache, and\n\n374\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.970\nit looks in its own host table.\n\n375\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.590\nIt goes and asks the DNS server.\n\n376\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.510\nIt goes out and checks and it waits.\n\n377\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.370\nAnd so it takes a little bit of time for\nit to get through.\n\n378\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.740\nSo all that can actually\ntake a bit of time,\n\n379\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.460\nas we start doing something like that.\n\n380\n00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.490\nBut that's one of the ones that\nyou may also end up doing, too.\n\n381\n00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:29.000\nSo the other thing that we can also try\nand do, let me scroll back up here.\n\n382\n00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.920\nThis is after the show\nrunning config again.\n\n383\n00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.420\nThe other thing that we're\nmissing at this point\n\n384\n00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.020\nis something that we already set up\nwhen we set up the secure connection.\n\n385\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:45.100\nIt's a secure remote connection,\nwhich is an IP domain name on this server.\n\n386\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.330\nSo we can also do that as well,\n\n387\n00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.530\nwhere we set up where it says,\nip domain-name, and put that one in there.\n\n388\n00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.132\nUsually that's also something\nelse that you can do.\n\n389\n00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:58.613\nIf you wanted to not use the DNS server\nin the way that we wanted to, And\n\n390\n00:23:58.613 --> 00:24:04.210\nyou could also do an IP name-server and\npoint the name server to somewhere else.\n\n391\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.070\nSo if you had another DNS server working,\nyou can even use your router\n\n392\n00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.390\nthat if it receives a DNS to say,\ngo and look over here instead.\n\n393\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.980\nAll of that is possible, but\nat least for this point and\n\n394\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.300\nthe way that our lab is configured, that's\npretty much all that we're gonna see.\n\n395\n00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.780\nBut you did see that it successfully\ndid work on the router here.\n\n396\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.920\nWe showed you how it was\nactually configured.\n\n397\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.550\nAnd even though that's a possibility, it's\nprobably not gonna be a realistic venture\n\n398\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:36.530\nfor you in production network where\nthere's already existing DNS servers.\n\n399\n00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.760\nBut let's say if I was setting this up for\na small office or\n\n400\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.090\na branch office of some sort.\n\n401\n00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:46.310\nThis may be sufficient as long as\nthe platform on my router will support it\n\n402\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.510\nwithout spiking to 100% and\nburning up the router itself.\n\n403\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.415\nSo you are fine [LAUGH] until that point.\n\n404\n00:24:54.415 --> 00:24:58.092\nBut just kinda remember, you'll have to\ndo a little bit more research to find out\n\n405\n00:24:58.092 --> 00:24:59.948\nwhether your router actually can do it.\n\n406\n00:24:59.948 --> 00:25:03.198\nSo, it's not just every single\none that supports 12.3, but\n\n407\n00:25:03.198 --> 00:25:05.090\nit is platform dependent on whether or\n\n408\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:09.390\nnot that particular router will support\nit too, so you do need to be careful.\n\n409\n00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.430\nSo, Zach, that actually does\nend our demonstration here for\n\n410\n00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.750\nsetting up DNS server on a router.\n\n411\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.070\nBut, remember, as much as I'd love to\ntell you, yeah, you should do this all\n\n412\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:23.040\nthe time, normally the only reason for\nus to do anything like this is if\n\n413\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.670\nwe wanted to make sure that we could ping\nother devices by name from that router.\n\n414\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.320\nAnd that's just setting up the IP host and\nthen the name and the IP address.\n\n415\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.050\nAnd that gives you that ability on\nthat router and not for anything else.\n\n416\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.310\nAnd you do that for\nall the other routers, too.\n\n417\n00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.570\nThat way, you don't have to go,\nwhat was the IP address to router two?\n\n418\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.210\nI don't remember.\n\n419\n00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.450\nAll you have to do is type in ping\nrouter two, and then you're off and\n\n420\n00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.770\nready to go, okay?\n\n421\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.250\nSo, Zach,\nthat's actually our demonstration and\n\n422\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.530\nour idea here of understanding\nDNS configuration for\n\n423\n00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.890\na router.\n&gt;&gt; Describe and\n\n424\n00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.680\nconfigure DNS on a router Part Two.\n\n425\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.420\nMake sure you see Part One, and Ronnie\nhas something else he'd like to say.\n\n426\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, once again,\n\n427\n00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.240\ndon't forget practice is the key here.\n\n428\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:11.050\nThis one is, again, a little bit of\na shorter lab demonstration for us.\n\n429\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.010\nBut at the same time,\nit's still valuable information.\n\n430\n00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.840\nMake sure you do learn about it.\n\n431\n00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.862\nIf you're already comfortable\nwith the idea of DNS,\n\n432\n00:26:17.862 --> 00:26:22.000\nyou can kind of move on from here and\nnot worry too much.\n\n433\n00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.390\nBut at the same time this may be easy\npoints for you, so review the concepts and\n\n434\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.010\nmake sure you get them down.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice and Ronnie has done\n\n435\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.840\na great job with Cisco CCENT the entire\nseries, make sure you see every episode.\n\n436\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.310\nAnd you will be in the course library\nwhere there will be other videos that\n\n437\n00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.350\nare available for\nyou to help you go further.\n\n438\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.345\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n439\n00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:44.510\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n440\n00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.610\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n441\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.073\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n442\n00:26:49.073 --> 00:26:55.105\n[MUSIC]\n\n443\n00:26:55.105 --> 00:26:58.249\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia-\n\n3\n00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:07.042\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.333\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:12.170\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT ProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.528\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:17.280\nempowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.360\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n9\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.640\nWe're gonna configure DHCP on a router.\n\n10\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.215\nYes, we are, and\nRonnie Wong is the man to do it.\n\n11\n00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:28.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, good to see you again.\n\n12\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for helping us as we\ncontinue on our CCENT journey together.\n\n13\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.890\nWe are now, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.150\nin the realm of taking a look at\ninfrastructure services, as well.\n\n15\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.330\nWhich now means, of course, learning\nabout some of the different servers.\n\n16\n00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.770\nThat you would also find in networking.\n\n17\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.820\nAnd we're starting to see something that\nwe might not have guessed before where\n\n18\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.180\nCisco routers can actually do\na lot more than just routing, but\n\n19\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.640\nit doesn't necessarily mean their always\nthe best thing to do for other things.\n\n20\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.330\nWe saw in a previous episode.\n\n21\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.965\nWhere we could turn the Cisco router\nto configure it to become a DNS server,\n\n22\n00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:05.410\n[INAUDIBLE] say DHCP.\n\n23\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.117\nBut it can do that too, so that's why\nwe're talking about this, okay, so\n\n24\n00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:14.376\nwe can actually run DNS as a service\non a network, using the router,\n\n25\n00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:18.229\nwe can also then turn around and\nrun what we call DHCP, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.540\nDHCP stands for Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol server.\n\n27\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.460\nNow, when we think about that, right,\n\n28\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.970\nas we break that terminology\ndown a little bit here.\n\n29\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.510\nLet me go ahead and\ndo that right up here, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.100\nSo, on my screen I will talk\nabout it word by word here,\n\n31\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.690\nso that we get this down by now.\n\n32\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.995\nHost configuration protocol.\n\n33\n00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:47.520\nAll right, so much for\n\n34\n00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.770\nmy ability to kind of be\nconsistent at my typing here.\n\n35\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.154\nDHCP.\n&gt;&gt; I think you are good,\n\n36\n00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:54.787\njust to be honest with you [LAUGH].\n\n37\n00:01:54.787 --> 00:01:55.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:57.560\nDHCP, okay.\n\n39\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.846\nSo, when we start to break that down,\nokay,\n\n40\n00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.745\nlet's talk about this idea\nof dynamic at the beginning.\n\n41\n00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.549\nWell, for us, every host machine\nthat you and I are on, a device\n\n42\n00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.414\nthat's represented in our network usually\na host means an IP address as well, but\n\n43\n00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.640\nthe very fact is it's\na device on our network.\n\n44\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.325\nWell, when we talk about\na dynamic configuration for that.\n\n45\n00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:19.135\nWe're saying that you and\n\n46\n00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:24.905\nI don't have to mainly touch that\nmachine to get some configuration on it.\n\n47\n00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.575\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, it means it's dynamic,\n\n48\n00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:27.905\nwhich means it's automatic.\n\n49\n00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:33.015\nIt will take individual host and\nprovide a configuration for it.\n\n50\n00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:37.220\nNow, the key here, though, is what\ntype of configuration is it providing?\n\n51\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.540\nIs gonna provide what normally at\nleast for what we need, right?\n\n52\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.995\nA uniform configuration across\nmultiple devices that we need, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So, you and\n\n54\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.920\nI don't have to manage whether,\nor not it's done.\n\n55\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.440\nIt normally will do it as long as not\nonly do we have server to provide that,\n\n56\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.550\nbut we also have, of course,\nclients then ready to listen, and\n\n57\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.660\nready to do that as well, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.830\nSo, we're gonna talk about in a couple of\ndifferent instances here at the beginning,\n\n59\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.470\nso that we understand the nature of DHCP,\nokay?\n\n60\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.690\nSo, in DHCP, what normally ends\nup happening is this, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.970\nA computer,\nsuch as PC1@ITPro.TV when we first plug\n\n62\n00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.870\nthat in to a network cable, if we leave it\nat its default, if it's a Windows machine\n\n63\n00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.870\nit is actually going to send out\na message out onto the network.\n\n64\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.500\nAnd that initial message is simple,\nit's called a DHCP discover packet, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.670\nThat DHCP discover packet.\n\n66\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.415\nIt is broadcast out to the entire network.\n\n67\n00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.310\n&gt;&gt; Now, the DNS server doesn't care,\nso it's gonna drop that packet.\n\n69\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.850\nBut a DHCP server says,\nhey, I just heard that, and\n\n70\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.400\nsomebody is asking for,\nwell, DHCP information.\n\n71\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.700\nAnd normally, the information that it's\nreally asking for at the beginning.\n\n72\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.130\nIs an IP address, a subnet mask,\nand a default gateway.\n\n73\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.620\nIt can also ask for other things too,\nlike an DNS Server if we want to.\n\n74\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.450\nAnd we can even configure it for\n\n75\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.760\nadditional information that we can pass\nout to whoever is asking for it, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.550\nSo, when we do that,\nthe DHCP server, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.510\nIt will go ahead and figure that out,\nthat it's heard this message, and\n\n78\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.860\nit will send out what is\ncalled a DHCP Offer, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.410\nNow, that DHCP Offer essentially has the\nbasic information that I told you about,\n\n80\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.450\nand it communicates it back,\nbut it does it in a broadcast.\n\n81\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.430\nSo, everything at this point\nis a complete broadcast.\n\n82\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.460\nNow, once we have that broadcast,\nthis guy goes, I don't need that, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.760\nSo, it drops it.\n\n84\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.760\nBut PC1 says, hey, I need that offer,\nand it will take that information and\n\n85\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.800\nautomatically configure that\ninformation back to us, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.570\nNow, once it does that and it takes it,\n\n87\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.200\nit will send back as a broadcast again,\na DHCP request.\n\n88\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.660\nNow, it's kind of weird that a request\nwould come after an offer, but\n\n89\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.400\nthe idea of the request at this\npoint is to tell the DHCP server,\n\n90\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.030\nplease don't assign this\ninformation to anybody else.\n\n91\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.930\nSo, I have now a unique address that\nwill work in this network, so please,\n\n92\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.440\ndon't assign my IP address\nto anybody else, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.430\nNow, when all that's done, right?\n\n94\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.080\nDuring that offer, as well,\nit will normally have a time limit on it.\n\n95\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.860\nSo, by default, like with Windows servers,\n\n96\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.410\nDHCP servers,\nit's usually an eight day default, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.610\nSo, it's a, here's the information for\neight days, you can lease.\n\n98\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.090\nThis IP address, and\nthis information for eight days here.\n\n99\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.940\nAnd now the DHC, or the PC says,\nyes, let me go ahead and do that.\n\n100\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.458\nAnd it will make an entry in its own\ndatabase there, of those IP addresses.\n\n101\n00:05:56.458 --> 00:06:00.810\nAnd then, sends back a final\nacknowledgment that I've got you down, or\n\n102\n00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.490\nthat eight day lease.\n\n103\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.510\nPC one will now begin to accept it.\n\n104\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.690\nAnd work it and\ndo whatever else it needs to.\n\n105\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.310\nOkay?\n\n106\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.350\nNow, all that is actually set up\nwhen we start to do this right away.\n\n107\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.950\nOkay?\n\n108\n00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.890\nSo, the key here is to understand\nthat the process is done.\n\n109\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.720\nThere's a neat little acronym\nthat's actually created here.\n\n110\n00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.450\nOkay?\n\n111\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.765\nTo remember the process of DHCP,\nyou just have to remember, DORA.\n\n112\n00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:28.870\nD-O-R-A.\n\n113\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.410\nOkay?\n\n114\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.890\nSo, that will help you to remember\nthat process that it doesn't.\n\n115\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.690\nAll of these at this point\nis done in a broadcast.\n\n116\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.489\nWhen you actually start\nseeing this information.\n\n117\n00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:43.570\nNow, initially, okay, when you start\ndoing this it works very well.\n\n118\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.810\nOkay, so that means all you and\nI have to do, if we were responsible for\n\n119\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.630\nsetting up 50 workstations, and\nwe had everything ready to go.\n\n120\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.720\nWe just plug it into the network,\nif my DHCP server's configured,\n\n121\n00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.690\nI don't have to walk around and\nassign IP addresses, Subnet mask, default\n\n122\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.290\ngateways to every individual machine, DNS\nServers, it will do it all for us, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.120\nSo, let's take a look at\nthat just briefly here.\n\n124\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.250\nAnd I'll go all the way\nover to our machine.\n\n125\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.830\nWhich is now not connected anymore.\n\n126\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.580\nLet me see if I can\nactually make it connect.\n\n127\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.190\nThere we go, so we are now connecting\nback to that machine for a moment.\n\n128\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.680\nLet me minimize this if I can.\n\n129\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.280\nAnd then, if I can I will zoom in here\nto help us out just a little bit.\n\n130\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.300\nApparently I have to actually zoom\nout again, so I can get to that menu,\n\n131\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.250\nthat taskbar down at the bottom.\n\n132\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.180\nSo, I'm gonna right click on the network\nadapter and go to open network and\n\n133\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.210\nsharing center.\n\n134\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.170\nI know that's a little bit small,\nbut I'm gonna zoom in now.\n\n135\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.110\nSo, that we can see it.\n\n136\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.124\nThen on the Lab_Nic, I'm not gonna\ntouch the one that says do not change.\n\n137\n00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:59.192\nThen I'm gonna select Properties here,\nand it's right here, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:02.510\nUnder Internet Protocol Version 4.\n\n139\n00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.553\nOn the Microsoft world.\n\n140\n00:08:04.553 --> 00:08:07.784\nEven though they don't call\nit DHCP on the client side,\n\n141\n00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:11.730\nthis machine is ready to accept\nthat type of connection.\n\n142\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.250\nThey call it obtaining an IP\naddress automatically.\n\n143\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.800\nSo if I set it this way and\n\n144\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.820\nI obtain an IP address automatically, and\nthen the second option will also appear.\n\n145\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.840\nSo I if do this notice all\nthe information disappears from here and\n\n146\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.590\nthen if I do this,\nit also disappears from here.\n\n147\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:36.260\nThat's because it is now ready to make\na DHCP discover message that's put\n\n148\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.780\nout into the wire to get an IP address to\ncome back and do what we need to do, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.190\nSo all that is possible.\n\n150\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.810\nSo this side is what initiates\nthat discover message and\n\n151\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.480\nenters the DHCP server,\nit is now responding and\n\n152\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.770\ndoing everything but I'd have to hit\nOK first, we're not gonna do that yet.\n\n153\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.090\nSo at this point,\nthat's what happens over here.\n\n154\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.940\nThe issue that you and\n\n155\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.440\nI have right now is that we don't\nhave a DHCP server set up, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.490\nSo when something like that ends up\nhappening then, this machine itself will\n\n157\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:16.010\nend up getting an IP address that begins\nwith 169.254.whatever.whatever, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.270\nAnd that is called an APIPA address.\n\n159\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.880\nNow if I click on that lab nick again,\n\n160\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.340\nselect Properties and Internet Protocol\nversion 4 and Properties again.\n\n161\n00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:34.320\nThere's something else that's strange,\nso I'm not saving the changes here.\n\n162\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.930\nBut notice as soon as I hit Obtain\nan IP Address Automatically,\n\n163\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.020\nan Alternate Configuration tab came up,\nokay?\n\n164\n00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.029\nAnd that Alternate Configuration tab,\nyou'll see if I can zoom\n\n165\n00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:51.642\nin here notice what it says,\nAutomatic private IP address.\n\n166\n00:09:51.642 --> 00:09:57.016\nA-P-I-P-A, APIPA, so\nthat's what it actually end up doing,\n\n167\n00:09:57.016 --> 00:10:02.204\nand that begins with 169.254\nwhich means that even though\n\n168\n00:10:02.204 --> 00:10:07.219\nthis client which is what this\nis cuz it's not a server itself.\n\n169\n00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:10.425\nIt is saying, I need an IP\naddress from a DHCP server and\n\n170\n00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:15.010\nthe information that comes along with it,\nwell, I'm not finding one.\n\n171\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.872\nSo it will automatically\nassign itself its own private\n\n172\n00:10:19.872 --> 00:10:24.530\nIP address in that range, 169.254, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.650\nAnd that's what it will\nallow you to be able to do.\n\n174\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.120\nNow even though technically that means all\nthe machines that don't get an answer from\n\n175\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.340\na DHCP server, they'll still be networked\ntogether inside of that network,\n\n176\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.080\nbut it's not useful for\nanything in today's world, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.095\nSo the only thing that we actually do with\nit is if we see that address beginning\n\n178\n00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:44.520\nwith 169.254,\n\n179\n00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.370\nthe APIPA address, it normally means we\nneed to check one of two things, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.160\nI need to check whether or\nnot my machine is configured or\n\n181\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.630\nwhat I needed to do which is,\nof course, to listen for DHCP or\n\n182\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.820\ntwo is there something\nwrong with the DHCP server?\n\n183\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.030\nAnd that's usually the two that\nwe have to be able to do, okay?\n\n184\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.000\nSo that's kind of the beginning point\nof what we're talking about in getting\n\n185\n00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.090\nset up here.\n\n186\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.070\nSo now that you understand that there\nis something that needs to be set up on\n\n187\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.190\nboth ends.\n\n188\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:17.220\nOne side has to be willing to be\nturned on and start the DHTP process.\n\n189\n00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.610\nThe other side has to be answering\nthe DHTP process that started as well.\n\n190\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.170\nSo that is what we are actually\ngoing to take a look at as well.\n\n191\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.030\nNow, we're also gonna end up\ndoing something else too.\n\n192\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.060\nWe're gonna talk about another procedure\nthat's gonna work with that process but\n\n193\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.000\nwe're gonna do it a little\nbit differently as well.\n\n194\n00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.390\nOkay, so we'll see that.\n\n195\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.160\nNow, right now,\n\n196\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.990\nthe only thing that we've done is that\nwe're starting to notice something, right?\n\n197\n00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.710\nIs that this looks like,\nbecause all using broadcast,\n\n198\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:52.350\nthat means it's limited at this point\nto only one side of this router, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.260\nIn other words,\nthat is our broadcast domain.\n\n200\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.210\nAnd for us, DHCP being our broadcast means\nas long as we're on the same broadcast\n\n201\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.980\ndomain, DHCP will work fine, okay?\n\n202\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.090\nBut we'll actually see that we can help\nout even another instance of it at some\n\n203\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:14.530\npoint if we have another site that needs\nDHCP, and I have the only DHCP run, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:20.540\nBut the neat thing is in Cisco LAN,\nwe can't take our router and\n\n205\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.460\nconvert it to DHCP if we wanted to,\nto do that DHCP handling.\n\n206\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.400\nBut traditionally,\n\n207\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.830\nat least in most networks today, they'll\nprobably run their own DHCP server.\n\n208\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.890\nNow, not all the time,\nbut you will have this.\n\n209\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.170\nAnd the other factor is, especially in\ntoday's networks at least as a recording\n\n210\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:43.660\non this show, we're seeing that notion of\nDHCP handed off to even other devices.\n\n211\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.540\nSo for example,\n\n212\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:50.460\nright here at IT PRO TV our firewall is\nhandling our DHCP internally instead.\n\n213\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.520\nSo we have all that ready and\navailable to us.\n\n214\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.530\nAnd even in other networks I've worked on,\nwe actually used\n\n215\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:01.330\na big layer three switch to do the same\nthing and to handle DHCP as well.\n\n216\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.243\nSo CISCO devices can do DHCP and\nhelp us out if we go,\n\n217\n00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:09.437\nwe don't really wanna set up\nanother machine to do so.\n\n218\n00:13:09.437 --> 00:13:13.209\nThat works especially great inside\nof a branch office environment or\n\n219\n00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:17.764\nyou're not willing to put a lot of money\ninto additional infrastructure to run it,\n\n220\n00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:21.840\nyou can run it all from your Cisco\ndevices if you choose to, okay?\n\n221\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.626\nSo that's the notion of\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n222\n00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:26.254\nAll right, so now, Zach, it's ready for\n\n223\n00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:31.300\nus to begin to take a look at our lab\nsetting and what we want to be able to do.\n\n224\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.540\nSo the first thing that we're\ngoing to do is I'm gonna zoom in,\n\n225\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.150\nat least I think I am here, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:43.640\nI keep saying that,\nI'm going to zoom in to NYEDGE1,\n\n227\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.495\nso that we can begin configuration of\n\n228\n00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:53.580\na DHCP server on NYEDGE1.\n\n229\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.590\nTrying to get to the point where\nwe can see the most of it there.\n\n230\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.550\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n231\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.320\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nbegin from here.\n\n232\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.800\nSo let me tap Enter a couple of times,\n\n233\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.720\nmake sure we can get access in,\nthen get into privileged exec mode.\n\n234\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:14.610\nFrom there into our global configuration\nmode as well, so configure terminal.\n\n235\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.110\nAnd once I'm in here,\nthere's a few steps that has to be done.\n\n236\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.240\nNow, we're gonna follow our lab\nguide here and it's the same lab,\n\n237\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.350\nI should have pointed that out at\nthe beginning which I did not.\n\n238\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.776\nThis is the same lab that we were\njust using for the DHCP and DNS.\n\n239\n00:14:30.776 --> 00:14:34.170\nWe just finished the DNS labs in\na previous episode right before\n\n240\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.840\nthis one if you're watching in the order.\n\n241\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.850\nIt's the same lab I'm just carrying\non from what they're showing us here.\n\n242\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.520\nThat means that whoever designed this\nsaid hey, that's a short enough topic for\n\n243\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.990\nanybody to cover in one lab except for\nRonnie Wong.\n\n244\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.340\nSo apparently that means I'm the one\nthat's talking way too much at times here,\n\n245\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.440\nbut that's what we see, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.459\nSo here we go, let's see if I can zoom\nin just a little bit better here,\n\n247\n00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:58.655\nget us all lined up.\n\n248\n00:14:58.655 --> 00:15:04.855\n[INAUDIBLE] need to do that except\nthat it can get a little bit dizzy.\n\n249\n00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:07.038\nAll right, so when we started doing this,\n\n250\n00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:11.140\nwe're gonna use the order in which\nit's set up in the lab as well, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.727\nSo at the very beginning, they have us\nrunning, well how do we configure DHCP?\n\n252\n00:15:15.727 --> 00:15:22.550\nWell that's ip, dhcp and then from\nthis point, let's do a question mark.\n\n253\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.520\nCuz when we ran this one for DNS,\nwe actually did IP, DNS server.\n\n254\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.750\nLet's see if we're actually\njust that lucky again here.\n\n255\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.250\nAnd there is a lot of\nadditional things here.\n\n256\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.200\nNotice all the details by comparison\nto what we saw in DNS, right?\n\n257\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In DNS we had like four options, okay.\n\n258\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.850\nWell with IP DHCP, look at that, Zack.\n\n259\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:50.310\nThere is what, about 20 or so\ndifferent options that we have.\n\n260\n00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.950\nFrom the s's, I'm noticing I don't\nhave the word server anywhere, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.987\nSo that means that they're expecting us\nto configure a couple of different things\n\n262\n00:15:59.987 --> 00:16:04.596\nto bring up our DHCP server in which\nwe've got to understand and do, okay?\n\n263\n00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.755\nSo we'll try this again, IP.\n\n264\n00:16:07.755 --> 00:16:09.880\nDHCP.\n\n265\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.614\nAnd this time,\nwe're gonna begin with the word pool.\n\n266\n00:16:13.614 --> 00:16:18.450\nSo if you take a look, it doesn't really\ntell you much except it says hey,\n\n267\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:23.842\nyou're gonna configure a pool of DHCP\naddresses here, is what you're gonna do.\n\n268\n00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:26.190\nWell, at least that's what\nyou would think right?\n\n269\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.180\nIf you're not familiar with the syntax\nmake sure you're using the question marks\n\n270\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.630\nto help you out.\n\n271\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.610\nI know it's a little bit more\nannoying at this point as well, but\n\n272\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.500\nactually they don't have a name here,\nso let's try this again.\n\n273\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.940\nSo, let's see if I can just\ntype in ip dhcp pool, and\n\n274\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.330\nit should tell me that it's\nincomplete at this point.\n\n275\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.972\nNotice it says incomplete,\nit's cuz I typed it in twice here.\n\n276\n00:16:48.972 --> 00:16:55.630\nIp dhcp pool, and then a question mark,\nthat's my fault, as well.\n\n277\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.555\nSo notice what it's asking me for\nwhich is a line.\n\n278\n00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.598\nRemember that when you see\nit all in capital letters,\n\n279\n00:17:01.598 --> 00:17:05.520\nit doesn't mean you type in the word\nL-I-N-E in capital letters,\n\n280\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.220\nit means give it a name,\nis what it's saying here, okay?\n\n281\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.450\nSo that's what it wants us to do.\n\n282\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:15.668\nSo, ip dhcp pool, and\n\n283\n00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:22.820\nwe'll call this one labpool.\n\n284\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.330\nThat doesn't look like it's spelled right,\nbut that is true, L-A-B-P-O-O-L, okay?\n\n285\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.251\nNow, notice that the command prompt here,\nokay?\n\n286\n00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:35.890\nThe prompt change.\n\n287\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.020\nThis time is DHCP config, right?\n\n288\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.480\nSo it changed right heer dhcp-config,\nand that's how you\n\n289\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.960\nknow that you are actually inside of that\nDHCP configuration that you need to be in.\n\n290\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.660\nNow, once we do that let's do a question\nmark one more time, so that we can see.\n\n291\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.420\nAnd it doesn't look like is\nactually getting smaller,\n\n292\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.750\nbut it looks like is growing.\n\n293\n00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.180\nLook at the number of things now,\nit looks like somewhere between 25 and\n\n294\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.290\n30, different commands that I can do.\n\n295\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.820\nThat sounds look, but\nnow I can do our server but\n\n296\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.320\nit says configure server ID option value.\n\n297\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.270\nLet's not worry about that for right now.\n\n298\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.860\nSo there's a lot of different things here,\nand as you go, do more and more,\n\n299\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.060\nyou'll learn about that.\n\n300\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.680\nBut right now,\n\n301\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.500\nwhat we want to configure is what\nis that pool, pool of IP addresses.\n\n302\n00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.780\nJust gonna begin with network, and then\nwe are gonna find a network number and\n\n303\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.530\na mask is what we're going to do, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.903\nSo from here, I am gonna do network\n\n305\n00:18:42.543 --> 00:18:47.628\nThen it can be 192.168.16.0, space and\n\n306\n00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:53.520\nthen a 24 bit subnet mask, 255.255.255.0.\n\n307\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.152\nAnd now I am saying here is\nthe pool of DHCP addresses,\n\n308\n00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:59.428\nthat I'm going to hand out from.\n\n309\n00:18:59.428 --> 00:19:04.996\nSo as the DHCP server responds\nto the DHCP discovery, right?\n\n310\n00:19:04.996 --> 00:19:06.004\nIt is actually sayin that.\n\n311\n00:19:06.004 --> 00:19:08.980\nNow, we're starting to see\nsomething else here too.\n\n312\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.280\nSo, it's telling me there's\nalready a ping conflict\n\n313\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.160\nwith another device that's going on.\n\n314\n00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.902\nSo DHCP server, that DHCPd it is saying\nthere's another DHCP server on this\n\n315\n00:19:19.902 --> 00:19:23.100\nnetwork which is strange,\nbut there we go, okay?\n\n316\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.331\nWe're getting one from I think\n16.2 is actually NY Edge too, so\n\n317\n00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:30.610\nthat's fine, and\nthen three is core or something.\n\n318\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.022\nSo, we'll find out what that's all about,\nbut we're not worried about for\n\n319\n00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:34.977\nit right now, okay?\n\n320\n00:19:34.977 --> 00:19:39.020\nAnd we'll kind of deal with that\na little bit later on here, okay?\n\n321\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.719\nSo I'd love to tell you that I did a lot\nof configuration, that's what's happening.\n\n322\n00:19:41.719 --> 00:19:45.123\nBut this is the set up inside\nof the lab at this point, so\n\n323\n00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:50.170\nwe're just going to ignore the error\nat this point, or the conflict so far.\n\n324\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.337\nAll right now, even though I'm gonna\nbe setting up from this network to\n\n325\n00:19:54.337 --> 00:19:56.709\nhand out all of these addresses, okay?\n\n326\n00:19:56.709 --> 00:20:01.109\nWhat we don't want to do is to actually\nend up overwriting someone's address or\n\n327\n00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:04.630\nhanding out an address\nthat's already in existence.\n\n328\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:10.160\nSo, within a network, you normally\nassign some addresses statically.\n\n329\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.330\nSo for example, your DNS server, okay?\n\n330\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:20.370\nOr maybe your ActiveDirectory domain\ncontroller, or maybe your DHCP server.\n\n331\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.640\nOther servers that are on\ntheir web servers,\n\n332\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.850\nyou'll only do not want that\nmanaged that dynamically.\n\n333\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.930\nThe reason why is that if the DHCP\nserver goes down, comes back up,\n\n334\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.700\nit could hand you a different address and\nthat could mess up everything, okay?\n\n335\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.210\nSo, usually there are some addresses in\nthat pool, that you're not gonna want,\n\n336\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.770\nhanded out, okay?\n\n337\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.420\nSo the way that we deal with that\nis we also set up an exclusion pool\n\n338\n00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.980\nis what we do, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:51.140\nSo the way that we do that is you can't\ndo it from within the dhtp config, so\n\n340\n00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.760\nI typed in exit at some point here.\n\n341\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.660\nThen you can do an Ip\ndhtp excluded address,\n\n342\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:06.521\nand now I can exclude\na portion of those addresses.\n\n343\n00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:10.577\nSo I can do 192.168.16.1, and\n\n344\n00:21:10.577 --> 00:21:15.405\nthen I do a space, and\nthen I tell it the upper limit.\n\n345\n00:21:15.405 --> 00:21:22.976\n198.168.16., I'm gonna do, let's do 15\nhere, that's what the lab says, okay?\n\n346\n00:21:22.976 --> 00:21:24.920\nSo we can also do that as well.\n\n347\n00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.780\nNow, if I do this range, that's perfectly\nfine, it will accept the range, but\n\n348\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.390\nif I wanna exclude a specific address,\nokay?\n\n349\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.090\nI can just do ip dhtp excluded address,\n\n350\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.750\nand just type in one single IP\naddress if I wanted to, as well.\n\n351\n00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.160\nSo that way if it doesn't fit\nwithin the range that I chose, and\n\n352\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.570\nI want to do another one,\nI can do that as well.\n\n353\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.430\nSo we can actually make that exclusion\nas we have it ready to go, okay?\n\n354\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.920\nNow, not only do we have something like\nthat, that we can end up doing here right?\n\n355\n00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.949\nIf I wanted to once again\nadd in a little bit\n\n356\n00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:03.125\nmore configuration into the DHTP Server,\n\n357\n00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:08.887\nthen I have to go back to ip dhcp pool,\nLabpool.\n\n358\n00:22:08.887 --> 00:22:11.409\nAnd now I'm back in that configuration,\n\n359\n00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:15.530\nnow I can add in some additional\nstuff that I wanted to do.\n\n360\n00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:20.121\nSo for example, what if I not only wanted\nto hand out IP addresses from this\n\n361\n00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:23.392\nnetwork, but\nI also wanted to hand out a DNS server?\n\n362\n00:22:23.392 --> 00:22:29.140\nI can type in, dns-server 192.168.16.10,\n\n363\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.851\njust for an example, okay?\n\n364\n00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.621\nSo then I can have that handed out.\n\n365\n00:22:33.621 --> 00:22:37.688\nEvery time that somebody actually\nrequested, it hands out not only the IP\n\n366\n00:22:37.688 --> 00:22:41.507\naddress, and the subnet mask, but\nit also of course hands out this.\n\n367\n00:22:41.507 --> 00:22:46.364\nUsually the other one that we also end up\ndoing here even though this one does have\n\n368\n00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.310\nit okay, is default router.\n\n369\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.295\nAnd that is going to be of course our\ndefault gateway which is going to be\n\n370\n00:22:52.295 --> 00:22:56.487\n192.168.16.1, is what we're gonna see.\n\n371\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.687\nAnd we can even add in a domain name,\ndomain-name,\n\n372\n00:23:02.687 --> 00:23:08.020\npractice-labs.com to add in that.\n\n373\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.810\nSo now, there's a bunch of additional\ninformation we're handing out with DHCP,\n\n374\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.390\nalong with this IP address and\nsubnet mask.\n\n375\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:20.382\nWe're not handing out a default gateway,\nwe're handing out a DNS server,\n\n376\n00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:24.527\nwe're handing out a domain name\nthat goes along with this too.\n\n377\n00:23:24.527 --> 00:23:28.609\nNow there's one more option I'm gonna add\nin that's not explicitly addressed in our\n\n378\n00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:29.241\nlab, okay?\n\n379\n00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:29.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n380\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.855\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is going to be a little bit more,\n\n381\n00:23:32.855 --> 00:23:36.950\nits an added part of what our\nexam objectives call out.\n\n382\n00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.290\nThere are some other services that\nyour network may require, and\n\n383\n00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:48.560\nwe can you use DHCP to essentially\npoint those devices too.\n\n384\n00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.110\nSo that they don't have to be configured\nwith that information very quickly, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.600\nSo that way they can automatically be\nadded only when those devices are.\n\n386\n00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.510\nNow you're talking about,\n[INAUDIBLE] running what?\n\n387\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.910\nWhat the heck are you talking about?\n\n388\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.748\nLet me give you an example here, okay?\n\n389\n00:24:02.748 --> 00:24:07.718\nAs you actually start setting\nup different network devices.\n\n390\n00:24:07.718 --> 00:24:12.069\nThere's a couple of different ones that\nyou may run across in a production network\n\n391\n00:24:12.069 --> 00:24:16.730\nthat may kind of work automatically, and\nyou're not sure how it works, right?\n\n392\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.430\nFor example, a Cisco IP phone, okay.\n\n393\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.110\nCisco IP phone, I don’t care whatever\nnetwork jack is in my network\n\n394\n00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:29.480\nI can plug it in and I can get\ninformation when it gets from DHCP.\n\n395\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.590\nNow, some of that information\nthat we get is actually\n\n396\n00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:37.140\nadditional to what we just set up, and\nthey're what we call options, okay?\n\n397\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.270\nOptions are actually other\nthings that DHCP can hand out\n\n398\n00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.150\nthat we didn't explicitly add in there.\n\n399\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.330\nSo now, we're adding in\nsomething like an option, and\n\n400\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.250\nthen when those options\nare assigned a number to them.\n\n401\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.760\nAnd then, we normally assign an IP\naddress to that option to tell it,\n\n402\n00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.730\nhere's where you get the information.\n\n403\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.530\nSo at the beginning, if I get\na Cisco phone coming in in the box,\n\n404\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.310\nI plug it up and I make sure it powers on?\n\n405\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.780\nWell, it will get an IP address and\n\n406\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.600\nthe information,\nit'll also get that option number.\n\n407\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.460\nWhen it gets that option, also assigned\nby doing what we're about to do here,\n\n408\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.870\nthen we'll know exactly what server to\ngo to get the proper configuration for\n\n409\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.060\nthat IP phone that it needs.\n\n410\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.716\nAnd it might be that it needs\nto run its own software.\n\n411\n00:25:25.716 --> 00:25:29.410\nAs it reboots, it might need to check\nif there's an update to that software.\n\n412\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.980\nIt can do all of that, okay,\nwithout you and I ever having to try and\n\n413\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.440\ngo, okay, I plugged in,\nnow I manually have to do updates.\n\n414\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.620\nI can do all that,\nall that can be handled right here.\n\n415\n00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.300\nThe other thing that you may find out,\nespecially in a mixed environment,\n\n416\n00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.090\nwhere you not only have regular desktops\nbut you may be working with what we call\n\n417\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:51.350\nthin clients as well,\nthat also need updates to happen.\n\n418\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.193\nWell, you can point that to\nsomething like a TFTP server too.\n\n419\n00:25:55.193 --> 00:25:58.385\nAnd then, that can also,\nwhen it reboots, it goes and checks and\n\n420\n00:25:58.385 --> 00:26:01.870\nverifies if there's an update to its\nfirmware or whatever it might be,\n\n421\n00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.804\nto pull that information down as well.\n\n422\n00:26:03.804 --> 00:26:06.520\nAnd any other configuration\nthat we need too.\n\n423\n00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.650\nSo usually that's something else\nthat we can do without having to\n\n424\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.140\nmanually go around and do that.\n\n425\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.840\nSo this is what we are gonna add in here.\n\n426\n00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.590\nSo let's go back to our screen.\n\n427\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.600\nAnd this will help us out, okay?\n\n428\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.571\nSo here, it's fairly simple.\n\n429\n00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:22.035\nWe just type in the word option, and\nwe're only gonna do one, which is 150.\n\n430\n00:26:22.035 --> 00:26:26.540\nNow, you might be wondering why 150,\ncuz that's specific to Cisco phones, okay?\n\n431\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.847\nIt's proprietary to Cisco phones,\nit will work for us, and\n\n432\n00:26:30.847 --> 00:26:34.737\nI'm just gonna add in 192.168.16.10.\n\n433\n00:26:34.737 --> 00:26:41.050\nSo usually that's gonna be for\na TFTP Server.\n\n434\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.780\nIt says it doesn't like that.\n\n435\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.510\nWell, let's try it one more time.\n\n436\n00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:49.520\nOption 150, and let's use the question\nmark to see what else it actually wants.\n\n437\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.703\nAn incomplete command here, I need an IP.\n\n438\n00:26:53.703 --> 00:27:00.490\nAll right, So option, let's try one\nmore time, I forgot the IP for this.\n\n439\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.980\nOption 150 IP,\n\n440\n00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.344\nlet me we verify, yep.\n\n441\n00:27:08.344 --> 00:27:12.860\nOption, and then,\nI need to know the address, IP.\n\n442\n00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.730\nAnd then, we'll try it one more time.\n\n443\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.433\n168.16, I'll just do .10 here.\n\n444\n00:27:17.433 --> 00:27:18.370\nThere we go.\n\n445\n00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.340\nSo that configures that option too.\n\n446\n00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.750\nSo that way, whenever you plug in a Cisco\nphone, and there's a TFTP server or\n\n447\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.880\nsomething like that,\nit doesn't matter which one.\n\n448\n00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.920\nThen, it knows to go to this TFTP to\nfind the information it needs to.\n\n449\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.180\nSo that said,\nthat's the idea that you also have, okay?\n\n450\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.070\nNow, there are other common\nones that you may chose,\n\n451\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.560\nlike 67 is for Boot P as well as DHTP.\n\n452\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.440\nThat really helps when we set up what we\ncall a DHTP relay which we're getting to,\n\n453\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.160\nbut we might not get to it before\nthe end of this show so far.\n\n454\n00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.960\nBut we are here, at least at this point.\n\n455\n00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.820\nSo we're gonna go on then.\n\n456\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.140\nThe other thing that we can also manually\nset is what we call a lease, okay?\n\n457\n00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.555\nNow, when we start seeing a lease,\n\n458\n00:28:04.555 --> 00:28:10.205\nnotice that I can tell it to lease that\ninformation between 0 and 365 days here.\n\n459\n00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:12.310\nI can tell it to infinite.\n\n460\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.160\nInfinite means it's never gonna\nlet go of that information.\n\n461\n00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.210\nWell, that's all up to you.\n\n462\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.790\nAs long as your network isn't\nchanging too much, then that's fine.\n\n463\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.020\nBut if you know that you're\nadding more and more devices,\n\n464\n00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.170\nlet's say on a monthly basis,\nthen that may not be the way to go, okay?\n\n465\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.510\nFor you, it may actually be.\n\n466\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.810\nLet me go ahead and\nlimit this to a certain time.\n\n467\n00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.340\nSo usually the default, like I said,\nis something like lease, and\n\n468\n00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.310\nthen eight days if you want to,\nso we'll just do eight instead.\n\n469\n00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:43.550\nSo that way that information will be valid\nfor eight days when you start doing this.\n\n470\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.940\nAll right, now let's see,\nanything else we need?\n\n471\n00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.650\nNope, from that point, we are now ready\nfor everything, okay, that we need.\n\n472\n00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.490\nNow, once this is done, okay?\n\n473\n00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.290\nAnd we've actually got all of these setup,\nokay?\n\n474\n00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.520\nNow, we have that answer, right?\n\n475\n00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.550\nBeginning with the DHTP offer,\n\n476\n00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:05.744\nall of these information we just configure\nwill be handed out as request comes in.\n\n477\n00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:08.510\nAll right, so we are gonna setup a client.\n\n478\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.630\nWe're not gonna use the PC.\n\n479\n00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:17.505\nWe're gonna use NY WAN one as a client,\nis what we're going to do.\n\n480\n00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:20.150\nI'm trying to check the time here, okay?\n\n481\n00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.627\nSo now, we're actually gonna use this,\nand we're gonna set this up as a router.\n\n482\n00:29:24.627 --> 00:29:28.854\nI'm gonna set up a router attached\nto use DHCP for its interface.\n\n483\n00:29:28.854 --> 00:29:32.285\nSo it should actually contact and\nget that information, and\n\n484\n00:29:32.285 --> 00:29:35.320\nthat should be assign\non this interface too.\n\n485\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.250\nNow Zach, the problem that I\nhave is I realizes I looked over\n\n486\n00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.180\nthat we're running out of\ntime very quickly here.\n\n487\n00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.120\nSo let's do this,\nlet's configure this for a part four.\n\n488\n00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.570\nI know it's kind of weird.\n\n489\n00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.170\nPart four?\n\n490\n00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:46.670\n&gt;&gt; Part two.\n\n491\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.490\n&gt;&gt; Part two.\n\n492\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.630\nLet's configure this for a part two.\n\n493\n00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.450\nSee my mind is [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Too much into the future.\n\n494\n00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.300\n&gt;&gt; Tell me about it, yeah.\n\n495\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.180\n&gt;&gt; Too much into the future there.\n\n496\n00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.470\n&gt;&gt; So let's do that, let's save this.\n\n497\n00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.720\nAnd then, we'll go ahead and\n\n498\n00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.660\nwe'll also set up the DHCP\nrelay in the very end here.\n\n499\n00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.360\n&gt;&gt; That's wonderful.\n\n500\n00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.210\nWell, configure DHCP on a router,\npart two, is coming your way.\n\n501\n00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.650\nThis has been part one.\n\n502\n00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.850\nExcellent episode, as usual,\nRonnie, very nice.\n\n503\n00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.280\nAnd anything else you'd like to say?\n\n504\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember, continue to do\nyour practice, cuz that's gonna be key and\n\n505\n00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.400\nessential for you.\n\n506\n00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.740\nAnd these particular concepts at this\npoint, they're gonna be necessary for you.\n\n507\n00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:24.160\nBut you'll probably not see\nthem set up on a Cisco device,\n\n508\n00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.550\nsuch as a switch or router.\n\n509\n00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.540\nUnless it's probably\na branch office environment,\n\n510\n00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.660\nwhich is not gonna change too often.\n\n511\n00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.370\nBut overall, though,\n\n512\n00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.850\nwe've still got a little bit of setup to\ngo so stay tuned for the next episode.\n\n513\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n514\n00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.640\nAnd Ronnie is terrific at\nturning over every stone,\n\n515\n00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.180\nmaking sure you get all\nthe information you need.\n\n516\n00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.450\nWatch everything in the Cisco C-Cent\nseries, every episode.\n\n517\n00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.900\nYou'll be so glad that you did.\n\n518\n00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.130\nAnd you'll be in the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos and\n\n519\n00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.390\nthey're there to help you go further so\ncheck those out too.\n\n520\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.760\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n521\n00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.400\nITPro.TV is binge-worthy.\n\n522\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.140\nThanks for watching.\n\n523\n00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:55.950\nI'm Zach

[LAUGH] Thank you,\n\n10\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.290\nZach, for helping me out, and\nreminding me that we're only in a part\n\n11\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.881\ntwo and not a part three or four here.\n&gt;&gt; I know just part\n\n12\n00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:34.627\ntwo.\n&gt;&gt; I know yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:37.791\nIt's amazing all of a sudden the lines\nstart blurring after you do so\n\n14\n00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:38.820\nmany of these.\n\n15\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.630\nBut yes, we are picking up in the middle\nof a lab as we're configuring DHCP\n\n16\n00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.690\non a router.\n\n17\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.900\nWe've just done a lot of configuration,\nright?\n\n18\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.940\nWhere we set up a pool,\nwe also set up excluded addresses.\n\n19\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.220\nWe set up different things that we\nnormally also want hand out such as\n\n20\n00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.960\na default gateway, a DNS server, set\nup a lease period of time, you name it.\n\n21\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.890\nWe've got it all set up,\nand even an option for\n\n22\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.720\nsomething like Cisco\nphones to plug into and\n\n23\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.890\nget their configurations as they need to.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n24\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.750\n&gt;&gt; Now, it means we also need to set up\n\n25\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.550\nfor, well the other side of this,\n\n26\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.200\nwhich of course would be all\nthose IP addresses from clients.\n\n27\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.880\nNow, traditionally, for us, it's easy.\n\n28\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.000\nWe take a regular desktop.\n\n29\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.510\nWe make sure that the options are set to\nobtain an IP address automatically, and\n\n30\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.070\nwe wait for\n\n31\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.940\nthat door process to end up happening.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n32\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.540\nright.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n33\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.130\nwe're gonna do something a little bit\ndifferently here, and the very fact that\n\n34\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.300\nwe're gonna setup a router to get\nan IP address configuration on\n\n35\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.980\nthis interface is what we're going to do.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n36\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.810\n&gt;&gt; Instead of aesthetically\n\n37\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.350\nassigning IP addresses,\nwe're just gonna configure this so\n\n38\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.734\nit can actually talk to\na DHCP server to do so.\n\n39\n00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:46.530\nSo that's where we are and let's take a\nlook at how we are going to do this, okay.\n\n40\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.810\nNow, so let's go ahead and\nmake sure that we can get into NYWAN1,\n\n41\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.690\nso I'm gonna start typing it and\n\n42\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.810\nget into privileged exec mode.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Once up there,\n\n44\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.179\nwrite into our global configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n45\n00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.778\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n46\n00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:03.974\nwe are now ready to configure for the\ninterface that we want which is gonna be\n\n47\n00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:08.586\ngigabit Ethernet 0/0, we wanna make sure\nthat that can get an IP address on it.\n\n48\n00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:13.521\nSo it's gonna be interface\n\n49\n00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:19.100\ngigabit Ethernet 0/0.\n\n50\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.040\nAnd this time round that we would\nnormally type in IP address, and\n\n51\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.630\nthen, let's do a question\nmark at this point.\n\n52\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.460\nNotice that we have two or\nthree options, right?\n\n53\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.260\nIt actually is three options,\nI should say two or three.\n\n54\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.990\nNormally, we would type in the IP\naddress which is ABCD here, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.120\nSecond option of course is DHCP.\n\n56\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.780\nAnd then, third option it says IP address\nauto configured from a local DHCP pool.\n\n57\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.260\nI don't have local DHCP pool setup, but\n\n58\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.290\nwhat I do have is DHCP setup\nover on ny edge 1, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.820\nSo instead, that is the option that\nwe are gonna use IP address DHCP,\n\n60\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.590\nand that should, and once we actually\nget it configured here ready to go.\n\n61\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.130\nNow, I still have to remember\nthat on all routers, right.\n\n62\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.590\nThat by default,\n\n63\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.430\nthe interfaces are shut down when you\nget it right out of the boxes well.\n\n64\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.270\nSo we're gonna issue\na no-shutdown at this point.\n\n65\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.380\nVerify that we are getting\nsome information.\n\n66\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.880\nAnd there it is, Zack,\nI can see the message right here.\n\n67\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.427\nIt tells me that DHCP with the syslog\nmessage of 6 address assigned.\n\n68\n00:03:32.427 --> 00:03:35.174\nAnd that this particular\ninterface got assigned\n\n69\n00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:36.300\n16.16 here.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n70\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.244\n&gt;&gt; And it even actually already saw a host\n\n71\n00:03:39.244 --> 00:03:43.124\nname as well, so that's pretty darn good.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n72\n00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:46.022\n&gt;&gt; So now, we actually do have the IP\n\n73\n00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:49.070\naddress assigned on here.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n74\n00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.775\n&gt;&gt; Let's check that out,\n\n75\n00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:55.025\ndo show IP interface brief.\n\n76\n00:03:57.443 --> 00:03:58.720\nAnd there it is.\n\n77\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.355\nAnd you will see that in\nthis show command here.\n\n78\n00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.760\n&gt;&gt; You'll not only have the IP address but\n\n80\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.560\nnow the method normally for us is a static\nwhen we've actually been assigning them,\n\n81\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.702\nright now, it says DHCP.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:13.900\n&gt;&gt; So it is actually showing that DHCP\n\n83\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.070\nserver just assign this address\nthe way we wanted to as well.\n\n84\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.070\nNow, let's check out one other thing and\n\n85\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.030\nverify that the address has\nbeen assigned from NYEDGE1.\n\n86\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.300\nIf I click back on NYEDGE1,\nlet me zoom back in so\n\n87\n00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.030\nthat we can see it a little\nbit better there, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.070\nThen, let's get into our shell mode\nhere or for privileged enabled,\n\n89\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.726\nwhich I'm not gonna be able to say,\nshow ip dhcp binded.\n\n90\n00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:53.490\nNow, the binding is essentially\na demonstration here\n\n91\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.370\nof what addresses have been handed out,\nokay?\n\n92\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.870\nSo if I press that,\n\n93\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.430\nI can now see that it actually did hand\nout two addresses at this point, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.780\nOne, actually, it actually expires.\n\n95\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.860\nIs that today's address?\n\n96\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.150\nNo, that's tomorrow's date,\nat least of the recording of this\n\n97\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.020\nshow, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.790\n&gt;&gt; But you can now see at least from what\n\n99\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.790\nI actually did, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.700\nAnd here it is, it's that IP address.\n\n101\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.600\nAnd notice it's mapped to this as\nwell okay which is a client side ID.\n\n102\n00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.990\nNormally, you would think that it\nactually ends up being the MAC address,\n\n103\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.380\nand the MAC address is somewhere in here.\n\n104\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.450\nBut there's also some additional added\nbits in here too from what it looks like.\n\n105\n00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.860\nAnd then, of course,\nyou have the least duration time, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.480\nSo this is when that lease is going\nto expire and it was dynamically or\n\n107\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.290\nautomatically configured.\n\n108\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.600\nSo DHCP binding is actually working and\n\n109\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.550\nseeing that as well.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n110\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.900\n&gt;&gt; So let's verify one more here.\n\n111\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.450\nAnd this time we're gonna\nchange our lab machine, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.980\nSo here inside of our lab machine, we know\nthat this one's been statically assigned\n\n113\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.980\nat this point, and now,\nwe go back down to properties, and then\n\n114\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.630\ninternet protocol version four, and I'll\njust zoom in at this point to help us out.\n\n115\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.007\nSo now that we have this, I can select\nobtain an IP address automatically,\n\n116\n00:06:19.007 --> 00:06:22.470\nobtain a DNS server address automatically.\n\n117\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.515\nAnd click OK.\nThen,\n\n118\n00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:27.050\nI also have to close this one out too.\n\n119\n00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:30.570\nAnd we'll close one more.\n\n120\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.370\nNotice how I dropped its connection for\n\n121\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.320\nright now?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n122\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.190\n&gt;&gt; And now, it picked it back up.\n\n123\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.320\nNow what does that mean?\n\n124\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.230\nIf I click on the details here,\nYou can now see instead of 192.168.16.10,\n\n125\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.075\nit did pick up the new address\nNotice the Lease Time expiration,\n\n126\n00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:53.810\nagain eight days from\nthis date of recording.\n\n127\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.730\nAnd it shows when it obtained it,\nwhich is today.\n\n128\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.520\nThen, it also picked up the default\ngateway, which we assigned to it.\n\n129\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.790\nIt also picked up the DNS Server,\nwhich we assigned, now,\n\n130\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.450\nit's no longer in existence.\n\n131\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.660\nSo it is getting all the proper\ninformation that we need, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.850\nSo DHCP is functioning fine.\n\n133\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.500\nNow, on this one, on the DHCP,\n\n134\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.700\nunlike the DNS server,\nI have set this one up on a network.\n\n135\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.500\nAnd it does work very well, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.070\nIt really does in networking quite well\nfor smaller networks, especially if\n\n137\n00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.470\nyou don't wanna bring up another server,\njust to have another server brought up.\n\n138\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.916\nSo it does handle this very well, and\nI've never had any problems with it,\n\n139\n00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:34.614\nactually kind of not\ndoing what it needed to.\n\n140\n00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:39.726\nSo I've used this one quite often because\nit really isn't too much that it has,\n\n141\n00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:44.244\nonce it assigns it out, unless your\nnetwork is constantly changing.\n\n142\n00:07:44.244 --> 00:07:47.740\nWell then, assigning an eight day\nlease is probably gonna be it.\n\n143\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.450\nBut in other instances, right, as you\ngo into the management of these things.\n\n144\n00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.910\nIf you have wireless devices that\nare constantly coming in and\n\n145\n00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.830\noff of your network, you wanna change\nthose to a lease time that's short, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.700\nBecause if not, that means that\nsomebody that's just visiting for\n\n147\n00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.230\nthe day end up getting\nan address at least for 8 days.\n\n148\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.793\nAnd this machine will go, I'm not\nhanding out that address for eight days.\n\n149\n00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:13.352\nI'm not gonna check until 50%\nof its least duration in 4 days.\n\n150\n00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:17.579\nThen, it's gonna wait the additional\n4 until it verifies that, you know,\n\n151\n00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:19.070\nthat it's expired.\n\n152\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.410\nSo in that sense, right, when you start\ndoing something like this, you do have to\n\n153\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.640\nkinda be mindful of different\ndevices that are also connecting.\n\n154\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.480\nSo if you do have visitors, you may\ninstead consider creating a different VLAN\n\n155\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.410\nand a different network essentially for\nguests that come on to your network, and\n\n156\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.760\nthen assign those under DHCP list pool\nas being something different too, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.680\nThat also tells us something\nwhich is quite neat.\n\n158\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.050\nYou can actually create multiple DHCP\nservers on your router and it can do that.\n\n159\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.020\nIt will actually hand out ones for\nwireless, and then hand out the other ones\n\n160\n00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.085\nfor which you want to but\nall out is actually possible, okay.\n\n161\n00:08:57.085 --> 00:09:01.700\nWe're not doing that so much in this\nshow but it is possible for us, okay.\n\n162\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.650\nAll right, now Zach,\nthere is another issues here that we need\n\n163\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.180\nto deal with as well.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n164\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.840\n&gt;&gt; So now, let's go ahead and\n\n165\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.140\nsee that too.\n\n166\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.482\nNow, we go back all the way over\nto our configuration over here.\n\n167\n00:09:12.482 --> 00:09:13.152\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n168\n00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.424\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes though,\n\n169\n00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:18.272\nlet's say that this branch right here,\neast.itpro.tv.\n\n170\n00:09:18.272 --> 00:09:19.460\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n171\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:19.960\n&gt;&gt; This is, let's\n\n172\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.090\nsay this is a branch office for\nus somewhere out there on the world but\n\n173\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.020\nthe infrastructure really resides right\nhere in our home, our headquarters,\n\n174\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.108\nwhatever you wanna call, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:32.000\nSo our DHCP server all that\nstuff is over here and\n\n176\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.480\neverything else is over here.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n177\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.580\n&gt;&gt; So we have all that available.\n\n178\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.590\nWell, let's say we didn't set\nup any of that over here.\n\n179\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.360\nI still need IP addresses\nin that network as well.\n\n180\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.450\nSo what do I need to do, well,\nwhat happens at that point is you, and\n\n181\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.770\nI will set up what it call a DHCP relay.\n\n182\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.438\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n183\n00:09:50.438 --> 00:09:53.150\n&gt;&gt; Now, a DHCP relay, it kind a works\n\n184\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.860\na little bit differently and\nthis is what we have to remember as well.\n\n185\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.540\nFrom this side, from the branch office,\n\n186\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.550\nokay going to that router interface\nover here when you have it right?\n\n187\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.340\nThat is all gonna be done doing\nbroadcast on this side, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.390\nBut once it hits the router\nwith that broadcast,\n\n189\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.460\nthe router's gonna stop broadcast.\n\n190\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.160\nSo we can't do that discover\nall the way through\n\n191\n00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.770\nto the DHCP server that I\nmight have setup over here.\n\n192\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.770\nI can have it on the router that's fine,\nbut it doesn't have it over here.\n\n193\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:34.280\nSo if I want that ability to do so, I need\nessentially for this DHCP Discover and\n\n194\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:40.020\neverything else to be relayed\nfrom that router's interface\n\n195\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.240\nall the way over to the DHCP server.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n196\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.130\n&gt;&gt; That's what I need it to do.\n\n197\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.210\n&gt;&gt; Now, when we do that,\n\n198\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.550\nwe set up what we call,\nof course, a relay, a DHCP relay.\n\n199\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:57.370\nAnd that is always gonna be on the\ninterface that faces that network, okay.\n\n200\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.353\nThe other network, not the one that\nthe DHCP server resides on but\n\n201\n00:11:01.353 --> 00:11:05.349\non the one that is facing,\nthe one that's requesting it, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:05.349 --> 00:11:07.273\nRemember, this side's\ngonna be all broadcast.\n\n203\n00:11:07.273 --> 00:11:11.848\nWell, when it comes through,\nthe rest of this process as it replies,\n\n204\n00:11:11.848 --> 00:11:18.170\nas it gets everything coming through here,\nall of this now is unicast traffic back.\n\n205\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.930\nSo it actually replies and\n\n206\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.600\ngets to everything else on\nthis side in a unicast format,\n\n207\n00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.690\nwhereas on this side it still goes out\nessentially as broadcast at that point.\n\n208\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.740\nSo we set up a single interface\nthat essentially does that and\n\n209\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.010\nthat is what we call the idea here of\nthat DHCP relay, okay, is what we have.\n\n210\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.412\nAll right so we're gonna set this\none up on our routers as well, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:41.412 --> 00:11:44.309\nSo we're going to go to NYEDGE2, and\n\n212\n00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:48.120\nI'll zoom in so\nwe can see it a little better here.\n\n213\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:55.758\nAnd we're gonna set this one up as our\nway of actually doing a relay help, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:55.758 --> 00:12:00.560\nSo an NYEDGE2 we selected interface\ngigabytes 0/0 that should be the one\n\n215\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.060\nthat's facing the network that's needed\nin DHCP Not the one that has DHCP on it,\n\n216\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.640\nbut on this one,\n\n217\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.960\nwe don't have the verification\nof how everything else is going.\n\n218\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.020\nSo, let me see if I can get to this one,\nall right.\n\n219\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.480\nSo, one term in here.\n\n220\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.550\nNow, I go to my global configuration,\nwhoops!\n\n221\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.900\nIt looks like I hit the Caps Lock\nthere.Configure terminal, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.108\nNow, that I've got configure terminal,\nI need interface.\n\n223\n00:12:28.108 --> 00:12:32.430\nGigabit Ethernet 0/0,\n\n224\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.630\njust trying to make sure I\nspelled Ethernet correctly.\n\n225\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.395\nAnd now, I also need an IP address, so\n\n226\n00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:46.596\nwhatever the IP address might be,\n172.16.23.1.\n\n227\n00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:53.309\nAnd I'll set that one up so\n\n228\n00:12:53.309 --> 00:12:57.440\nnow I can respond from that particular\npoint if we need it to as well.\n\n229\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.350\nOr whatever the address is,\nit doesn't really matter for us,\n\n230\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.020\nyou know that we want.\n\n231\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.140\nThen, on this same interface,\n\n232\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:11.510\nI need IP Helper\n\n233\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.450\naddress and then this is where\nI tell it where the location,\n\n234\n00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.820\nthe IP address of my DHCP server, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.410\nNow once I do that right, so\n\n236\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:33.580\nI would have now another maybe that other\nDHCP server on the one that we set up.\n\n237\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.480\nI would create another poll, and say hey\nthis is what's gonna respond to the other\n\n238\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.040\nside, and then,\ngive it the addresses that needs to.\n\n239\n00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.980\nThe great thing is when we talk\nabout those options right,\n\n240\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.550\nthis is where options are very important.\n\n241\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.730\nOkay.\nThe reason why is that I don't want to\n\n242\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:54.690\nhave to put a TFTP server or\nanything else over in that branch office.\n\n243\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.335\nI want to keep that all\nwithin my own home network.\n\n244\n00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:57.960\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n245\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.910\n&gt;&gt; So if I do anything on that pool that\n\n246\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.020\nit's responding to is I want to\nmake sure that those particular\n\n247\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.050\noptions are set up for\nthat pool going across the rely agent\n\n248\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.470\nis what I want to do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n249\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.400\n&gt;&gt; That way, if now we send Cisco IP\n\n250\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.010\nphone to the branch office.\n\n251\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.570\nWhen they plug it in,\nthey are gonna get DHCP but\n\n252\n00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.510\nthey're also going to get that\nhelper through that helper address.\n\n253\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.260\nAnd that helper address is going to\nprovide them with the option to connect\n\n254\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.720\nand get the latest firmware.\n\n255\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.580\nGet the latest information\nthat they need to bring\n\n256\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.940\ndown, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n257\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.820\n&gt;&gt; So once all of that is done, well,\n\n258\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.710\nthat's pretty much it\nthat we have to set up.\n\n259\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.820\nSo from this point,\n\n260\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.000\nwe don't actually have another network\nthat's actually set up this way.\n\n261\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.600\nBut that is pretty much the key.\n\n262\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.050\nAnd what you wanna remember, of course,\nis the syntax right there, okay,\n\n263\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.480\nif you're a DHCP relight IP\nhelper address is the key here.\n\n264\n00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.140\nMake sure that IP address points\nback to your DHCP server.\n\n265\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.940\nOnce that's setup, you're now ready to go.\n\n266\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.630\nOkay?\n\n267\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.650\nNow, there is a couple of other things\nthat you can also end up using for\n\n268\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.410\ntrouble shooting too.\n\n269\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.280\nSo remember that we actually\ndid in our first part here.\n\n270\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.230\nWhereas we started,\nwe started the DHCP server, and\n\n271\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.870\nwe saw some DHCP conflicts, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n272\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:13.724\n&gt;&gt; We saw DHCPD, so\n\n273\n00:15:13.724 --> 00:15:15.860\nthat there's some conflicts that go on.\n\n274\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.783\nWell, if you get messages like that,\nyou can type in show ip\n\n275\n00:15:21.783 --> 00:15:27.813\ndhcp conflict, Okay?\n\n276\n00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:29.340\nAnd this will go ahead and\n\n277\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.084\ntell you what is actually happening if\nthere's any type of conflict, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:34.084 --> 00:15:40.571\nIt says, hey, there was a conflict\nbetween IP address 2.2 and .3.\n\n279\n00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:43.782\nAnd the way that I detected\nit was using ping here.\n\n280\n00:15:43.782 --> 00:15:49.801\nSo at some point something like\nthat actually did end up happening,\n\n281\n00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:53.707\nalso if you wanna verify\nthat your address or\n\n282\n00:15:53.707 --> 00:15:57.718\nyour DHCP pool on\nthe router is also working,\n\n283\n00:15:57.718 --> 00:16:01.834\ntype in that do show\nIP DHCP binding again, and\n\n284\n00:16:01.834 --> 00:16:07.350\nverify that you are actually\ngetting those addresses.\n\n285\n00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.488\nAnd here's the one that you and\nI had actually setup on that router.\n\n286\n00:16:12.488 --> 00:16:16.115\nSo it's 16.16,\nif I remember right that's ny wan 1,\n\n287\n00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:20.594\nand then 16.17 there at the end\nright down here, that's actually for\n\n288\n00:16:20.594 --> 00:16:24.095\nthat PC that we setup when we\nturned everything on as well.\n\n289\n00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:28.560\nNow, if you ever need this chance,\nso let's take the 16 19216816.4.\n\n290\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.268\nLet's say that I wanted to\nclear that one out here.\n\n291\n00:16:33.268 --> 00:16:39.991\nI can type in clear, oops,\nI need to go into my privilege mode here.\n\n292\n00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:44.697\nSo then, I can type in clear,\n\n293\n00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:50.694\nIP DHTP binding 19216816.4.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n294\n00:16:50.694 --> 00:16:53.010\n&gt;&gt; And that essentially will drop\n\n295\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.530\nthe lease for that.\n\n296\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.650\nThen, I do a show ip dhcp binding.\n\n297\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.870\nAnd now we should see that\nthat address is now gone\n\n298\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.990\nFrom that binding table, or\nthat database that we saw instead.\n\n299\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.780\nSo if you ever need to clear it out and\ntell it to start all over, so\n\n300\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.520\nlet's say that for example you realize\n\n301\n00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.150\nI'm running out of IP addresses because\nwe've allowed for these eight day leases.\n\n302\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.150\nYou need to gather some bak.\n\n303\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.910\nWhen you may, go ahead and\nstart kicking off some of that.\n\n304\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.310\nAnd you can do that very quickly by\ndoing this, releasing that binding.\n\n305\n00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.560\nAnd that way,\nthat address can be reuse again if\n\n306\n00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.680\nyou need to.\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n307\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.870\n&gt;&gt; But all of that is actually\n\n308\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.790\npossible for you.\n\n309\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.700\nSo take a look, make sure you look at\nthis show commands that we'd show you in\n\n310\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.711\nthis episode as well as\nin the DNS episode too.\n\n311\n00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:46.642\nAll these specially for the infrastructure\nservices are going to be helpful and\n\n312\n00:17:46.642 --> 00:17:50.515\nyou're gonna need them because a lot of\nwhat you do specially with the services\n\n313\n00:17:50.515 --> 00:17:54.153\nnot so much to set them up on the routers\neven though we showed that they're\n\n314\n00:17:54.153 --> 00:17:57.441\npossible but\nit's to troubleshoot them because normally\n\n315\n00:17:57.441 --> 00:18:00.050\ndeal with them They've\nalready been set up.\n\n316\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.050\nSo make sure you take a look\nat the verification and\n\n317\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:07.390\nuse these show commands to show you\nwhether or not it's actually working or\n\n318\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.000\nnot.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n319\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.440\nso configure DHCP on a router part two,\nthat concludes it.\n\n320\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.780\nAnd make sure you see part one, important.\n\n321\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.810\nRonnie, before we move on, anything else?\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\n\n322\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.400\nonce again there's no way to over-size\n\n323\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.340\nthe fact that you need to be doing\nthis on a daily basis at this point.\n\n324\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.840\nAnd you need to be getting faster, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.720\nSo do not get frustrated at the very\nfact that you can't type quicker.\n\n326\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.980\nYou need to just continue\nto try to type quicker.\n\n327\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.740\nI know that sounds silly.\n\n328\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.360\nBut you are facing an exam that's\ngonna require you to build speed.\n\n329\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.040\nSo make sure you can do that.\n\n330\n00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.272\nIf you have not been\npracticing subnetting,\n\n331\n00:18:44.272 --> 00:18:48.394\nI haven't been mentioning it recently as\nfar as series of shows we've been doing.\n\n332\n00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:52.023\nMake sure you are also practicing\nsubnetting on a daily basis too.\n\n333\n00:18:52.023 --> 00:18:55.103\nWhen you've gotten into this point, and\nyou haven't been, now is that time you\n\n334\n00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:58.520\nstart cramming for that if you are trying\nto get ready for that that exams as well.\n\n335\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.710\nThat's a huge topic on the exam.\n\n336\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.080\nThat's something you don't wanna be\ncaught behind the eight ball on as well.\n\n337\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.210\nBut at that point, though, you're\nactually getting pretty close to being\n\n338\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.750\nable to see the whole picture of what it's\nlike to actually be able to do and manage\n\n339\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.210\nan entire network here on router switches,\nand then, now even an additional services.\n\n340\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.320\nSo there's a lot of information\nwe presented so far, and\n\n341\n00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.180\nwe still got a bit to go.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice.\n\n342\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.530\nAnd you're right,\nyou represented a lot of information and\n\n343\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.630\nit's available in the CISCO C set series,\nmake sure you see every single episode.\n\n344\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.830\nGood stuff, good for you, and you'll be\nin the course library whether's there be\n\n345\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.010\na thousand of other videos\nthat are also good for you.\n\n346\n00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.364\nSo check those out as well.\n\n347\n00:19:35.364 --> 00:19:36.923\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n348\n00:19:36.923 --> 00:19:38.730\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n349\n00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.323\nThanks for watching.\n\n350\n00:19:39.323 --> 00:19:40.719\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n351\n00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:42.051\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n352\n00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:50.070\n[MUSIC]\n\n353\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.579\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.490\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.176\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:11.702\nwatching ITProTV, helping you learn\n\n6\n00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:17.470\nwherever you go, I'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.710\nAs we continue on with Cisco CCENT,\nwe're gonna configure and\n\n8\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.830\nverify NTP in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.250\nAnd who's gonna show us how to do that?\n\n10\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.730\nWell, he's right here, Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.360\nRonnie good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you Zach for\n\n12\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.090\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue together with our CCENT journey\n\n13\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.010\n&gt;&gt; We are, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.230\ntaking a look at the topic\nof infrastructure services\n\n15\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.100\nthat we're dealing with.\n\n16\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.940\nAnd today we're gonna be configuring and\nverifying, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500\nthe nature and use of NTP,\nwhich is the network time protocol.\n\n18\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.840\nAnd this particular element of what\nwe're doing is very important.\n\n19\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.230\nAnd it becomes even more important as\nwe start adding in multiple devices\n\n20\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.790\ninto our network.\n\n21\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.650\nThe reason why,\nespecially on Cisco devices,\n\n22\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.780\nis that when you start to make\nthem work together, right?\n\n23\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.680\nAs you put them into their particular\ninfrastructure, and you set them up,\n\n24\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.530\nand connect them together, it could\nbe that even from the factory, right?\n\n25\n00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.630\nThe time was set a little bit differently.\n\n26\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.420\nNow, when I talk about\na little bit differently,\n\n27\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.690\nZach, it may not even be a whole second,\nokay.\n\n28\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.990\nIt may even just be off, let's say,\n\n29\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.498\na thousandths of a second, okay, maybe\ntwo or three thousandths of a second.\n\n30\n00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:32.580\nSome of them may be off by even\na hundredth of a second, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.970\nAnd it doesn't sound like much,\nbut as time continues to go on,\n\n32\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.240\nin their productivity as they're\nworking and they're functioning.\n\n33\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.030\nThat time can continue to actually start\nto build up, and that is what we call time\n\n34\n00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.210\nslippage or something like that,\nit begins to build up.\n\n35\n00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.590\nAnd the nature and\nthe problem with something like that,\n\n36\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.750\nis when it comes down to\nauditing of some sort.\n\n37\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.320\nAnd actually trying to put a timestamp\non something that may have occurred.\n\n38\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.157\nWell, now that those\ndifferences are there,\n\n39\n00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:06.794\nthere's no way to align those\ndevices back together in that\n\n40\n00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:12.150\nway that we need to that will help us to\nget everything back together very easily.\n\n41\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.760\nSo by themselves,\nif left to their own devices,\n\n42\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.690\nwhatever their time slippage is\nas they continue to function,\n\n43\n00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.360\nit'll probably begin to happen more,\nand more, and more over time.\n\n44\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.750\nSo that is a problem,\n\n45\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.640\nespecially because the very fact is\nin today's networks, we wanna keep\n\n46\n00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.110\na consistent time with those devices.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n47\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.980\nthat we're not actually off when we go and\ntry and pull records.\n\n48\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.510\nWhich one's accurate then, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.652\nIs it the one that's off\nby a hundredth of a second?\n\n50\n00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:41.070\nIs it one that's off by a thousandth\nof a second, but compared to what?\n\n51\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.680\nOkay, that's what we need to know about,\nyou know?\n\n52\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.210\nNormally, as long as they're all\nconsistent, we don't really care that much\n\n53\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.380\nin terms of the hundredth or\nthe thousandths of a second.\n\n54\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.100\nBut it does begin to add up,\nlike I said, over time and\n\n55\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.940\nthat's where the problem comes in.\n\n56\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.140\nSo it is actually a very important\npart of our networking of what we do\n\n57\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.630\nto ensure that we have proper time\nsynchronization between these.\n\n58\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.200\nSo it is key for what we talked about,\nreally the idea of logging here and\n\n59\n00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.640\nmessage comparisons.\n\n60\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.540\nIf we actually pull up one syslog message\nthat shows that there's an error.\n\n61\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.420\nIf I pull up another one on\nanother machine, and it shows but\n\n62\n00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.750\nit's actually off by say like an hour.\n\n63\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.240\nWell, is it actually\nreferring to the same event?\n\n64\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.400\nIt's possible,\nin my extreme case, probably not.\n\n65\n00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.760\nBut let's just kind of go with it, right.\n\n66\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.950\nIs it actually referring\nto the same event, or\n\n67\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.080\nis it referring to two different events?\n\n68\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.020\nWell you and I would never really know if\nit's actually referring to either one.\n\n69\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.210\nSo in that sense, that's when we\nactually start to have to try and\n\n70\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.800\nfigure out what we can do.\n\n71\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.660\nSo the overall goal of course then,\nis making sure that we are consistent with\n\n72\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.590\nour time across all of our Cisco devices.\n&gt;&gt; So this might be a little bit\n\n73\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.300\nrhetorical but you can time sync\nall your Cisco devices, right?\n\n74\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.710\nAnd that's what we're\ngoing into right now.\n\n75\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.320\n&gt;&gt; That is true,\n\n76\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.510\nand that's what our goal is.\n\n77\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.663\nRight, is to make sure that\nwe understand first of all,\n\n78\n00:04:00.663 --> 00:04:03.700\nhow these clocks work just a little bit,\nokay?\n\n79\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.215\nAnd then we wanna show you how\nyou configure them to actually\n\n80\n00:04:07.215 --> 00:04:08.630\nwork together as well.\n\n81\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.192\nSo, in our set up for us creating\nwhat we call of course, not creating,\n\n82\n00:04:13.192 --> 00:04:18.770\nbuilding up to the fact that we're gonna\nbe issuing NTP network time protocol.\n\n83\n00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.924\nActually makes us less responsible for\nit and\n\n84\n00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:23.142\nallows machines to\nbecome more responsible.\n\n85\n00:04:23.142 --> 00:04:25.626\nAnd the reason why is that, you and I,\n\n86\n00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:30.060\nwe might be able to adjust it\nto some point where it's close.\n\n87\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.173\nBut NTP, the network time protocol, can\nadjust it to where it's actually off just\n\n88\n00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.720\nwithin, like I said\na milliseconds a lot of times.\n\n89\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.360\nAnd so that might be a better option for\nus depending on what we're doing.\n\n90\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.330\nSo that is where we\nwant to start off here.\n\n91\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.430\nSo let's take a look here,\nabout what we're going to do as well.\n\n92\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.194\nNow, I'm gonna use this router and\n\n93\n00:04:52.194 --> 00:04:57.264\nthe lab that we're on inside of\npractice-labs.com right now is\n\n94\n00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:02.541\nthe one that says configuring and\nverifying NTP operation as well.\n\n95\n00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:07.390\nNow, in this lab, they don't have us doing\nthis part that I'm about to show you.\n\n96\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.281\nOfficially in the lab setting itself,\nNY WAN is turned off and this is a default\n\n97\n00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:17.044\nconfiguration, there is nothing\nconfigured on this router at all, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:19.907\nSo this one is just like you\npulled it right out of the box,\n\n99\n00:05:19.907 --> 00:05:21.340\nand everything is up.\n\n100\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.413\nBut I wanted to show us some of the basic\nthings that we have to understand as we\n\n101\n00:05:25.413 --> 00:05:28.868\nstart syncing up the time and\ngetting everything ready, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:28.868 --> 00:05:31.988\nSo I do wanna tell you something,\nthat there is a manual way for\n\n103\n00:05:31.988 --> 00:05:34.510\nus to begin at least some synchronization.\n\n104\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.644\nOkay, but at the same time as you\nstart adding in more and more devices,\n\n105\n00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:38.697\nwhen you do that right?\n\n106\n00:05:38.697 --> 00:05:42.644\nYou're gonna actually start seeing that\ntime skew, that time slippage that we're\n\n107\n00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:46.360\ntalking about that becomes a little\nbit harder to actually do here.\n\n108\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.840\nSo let's go ahead and at least show\nyou some of these different commands.\n\n109\n00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.020\nNow when we start to pull\nup a Cisco router and\n\n110\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.290\nwant to see what the clock is like here.\n\n111\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.490\nLet me go ahead and\nget access into the privilege exec mode,\n\n112\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.180\nlet me type in show clock here.\n\n113\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.310\nAnd right now let me zoom in so\n\n114\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.430\nthat we can see that a little\nbit better there okay.\n\n115\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.090\nYou can see that it is actually set\nin couple of different parts of\n\n116\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.760\nwhat we're seeing as the output, right?\n\n117\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.133\nNow notice that after\nthe show clock command,\n\n118\n00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:28.810\nI get an asterisk, and\nthen I get 17:26:41.939, right.\n\n119\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.480\nThat's a tenth of a second right there,\nthat's a hundredth.\n\n120\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.450\nThis is thousandths of a second so\nit at least goes out to the thousandths of\n\n121\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.760\na second when I asked\nit to show the clock.\n\n122\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.721\nWhat are the chances, Zach, if I manually\nconfigure another one to try and\n\n123\n00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:43.715\nsync up this?\n\n124\n00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:48.290\nThat I'm gonna be able to, now,\nas time has actually even elapsed, right?\n\n125\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.580\nThat I can set it all the way\nup to a thousandth of a second.\n\n126\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.651\nProbably, not exactly great.\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n\n127\n00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:54.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not exactly great, right?\n\n128\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.890\nBut just to show you, right?\n\n129\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.400\nSo you're seeing that, we're gonna come\nback to this asterisk here in a moment.\n\n130\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.770\nBut the other part is UTC, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.430\nNow, UTC, essentially, actually,\nI shouldn't say essentially,\n\n132\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.020\ntechnically right, it is actually what\nis called coordinated universal time.\n\n133\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.108\nOkay, now you might think,\n\n134\n00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:18.950\nwell shouldn't that be cut then,\ncoordinated universal time.\n\n135\n00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.870\nWell a couple of things happened here,\nthat we ended up with UTC which is not\n\n136\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.000\ngonna make much sense Zach, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n137\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.600\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n138\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.970\nlet me explain this, you've probably\nseen UTC everywhere in networking,\n\n139\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.820\nit's just all over the place, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.770\nBut the reason why we ended up with UTC\nis that the English, the British, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:42.508\nThey came up with the true name of it\ncalled, Coordinated Universal Time, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:45.901\nNow on and\nabout same general time period, and\n\n143\n00:07:45.901 --> 00:07:49.124\nthis happens more often\nthen we realize it.\n\n144\n00:07:49.124 --> 00:07:56.180\nAnother nation also came up with\na way to designate this idea.\n\n145\n00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.970\nBut independently.\n\n146\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.102\nSo they weren't working on it but\nthey designated independently and\n\n147\n00:08:00.102 --> 00:08:01.470\nit was France, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.530\nAnd France said,\n\n149\n00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.120\nhowever the French say stuff like\nthis cuz I don't know exactly how.\n\n150\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.500\nBut their acronym turned out to to be TUC,\nso\n\n151\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:16.160\nI'm assuming something like time universal\ncoordinate, whatever it might be, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.950\nSo they came up with that.\n\n153\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.900\nWell, because of the very fact that they\ncould not actually agree to who actually\n\n154\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:30.870\nshould own or should claim provenance to\nwhat this coordinated universal time is.\n\n155\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.170\nThey compromised and\nsaid, we'll just do this.\n\n156\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.790\nIt won't be either one of us.\n\n157\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.560\nSo they actually decided on UTC.\n\n158\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.430\nSo instead of CUT or TUC, they said,\n\n159\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.840\nlet's just turn this whole thing around.\n&gt;&gt; So UTC.\n\n160\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.870\n&gt;&gt; UTC and\n\n161\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.170\nthere's not really an acronym for it.\n\n162\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.290\nWe all think that it actually stands for\nuniversal time coordinate.\n\n163\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what I was gonna say.\n\n164\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.120\n&gt;&gt; But technically it's not.\n\n165\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.747\nIt's actually just the compromise\nbetween those two organizations.\n\n166\n00:08:55.747 --> 00:08:56.966\nSo more trivial facts for\n\n167\n00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:59.649\npeople to not really care about.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n168\n00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:00.690\ncool.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n169\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.630\nsomething that actually stuck\nin my mind as well, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.230\nAnd then of course you\nhave the day of the week.\n\n171\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:11.060\nAnd the month, the day and the four\ndigit year for what we see it, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.400\nNow, let's go back to this asterisk\nright here at the beginning,\n\n173\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.260\nbecause that's actually more\nimportant than we think, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.360\nThe asterisk is actually\nnot saying that it is\n\n175\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.480\nexactly what the universal, this UTC is.\n\n176\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.800\nOkay?\nIt's not really saying that saying, but\n\n177\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.430\nRonnie, it says UTC right there.\n\n178\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.450\nWhat it's actually saying\nwith this asterisk though,\n\n179\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.291\nis that,\nit is saying that I am guessing and\n\n180\n00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:44.755\nI alone am saying that this\nis 172641939 UTC time.\n\n181\n00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:46.740\nSo that means that it hasn't\nconfirmed it with anybody.\n\n182\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.020\nIt hasn't actually done that.\n\n183\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.320\nIt is saying that according to what\nI know right now from the factory,\n\n184\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.110\nthat this is what it should be.\n\n185\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.410\nUniversal coordinated time, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.200\nAnd it should be this.\n\n187\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.270\nSo that's what we have when we\nstart seeing something like that.\n\n188\n00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.060\nSo it's not authoritative and\nit cannot be guaranteed that this is\n\n189\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.997\naccurate at this point whenever\nyou see that asterisk, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.400\nSo just because you see\nthat it shows you a clock,\n\n191\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.940\nit doesn't mean that it's accurate.\n\n192\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.570\nSo what is this about?\n\n193\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:20.080\nA router has two particular pieces of time\nthat it actually coordinates off of, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.250\nOne is a hardware clock inside of it.\n\n195\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.420\nSometimes as you read the information\nthat you find on the internet about this,\n\n196\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:35.850\nyou actually end up learning that, you\nread the term Calendar, instead of Clock.\n\n197\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.850\nSo, it just depends on\nthe age of the device itself.\n\n198\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.250\nThe viewers might be referring to\nthe Calendar Technically what they're\n\n199\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.130\nreferring is the hardware clock that\nwas built in at the Cisco factory\n\n200\n00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.660\nwhen they designed it, okay,\nand that keeps a track of time.\n\n201\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.060\nNow why is that important?\n\n202\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.620\nBecause with that time itself and\nthe way that keeps track of it,\n\n203\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.510\nthere's a battery backup which\nmeans that even between reboots,\n\n204\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.840\nit keeps the time and actually does that.\n\n205\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.960\nAnd the great thing is, we've seen this\nhappen, even in our own computers.\n\n206\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.990\nWhen we shut down the computer, let's\nsay we shut down a computer for a week.\n\n207\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.020\nToday that would be unheard of, of course.\n\n208\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.570\nBut when I first started,\nshutting down a computer for\n\n209\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.860\na week was not exactly unheard of.\n\n210\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.119\nNow not in a business setting but at home,\nwe used to shut down the computer and\n\n211\n00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:17.936\njust turned it on when we needed it, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:17.936 --> 00:11:19.649\nAnd then it would come back up and\nthe right time would be there and\n\n213\n00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:20.230\nwe'd be like, wow.\n\n214\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.070\nThat was pretty cool.\n\n215\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.320\nIt was off, Power off, and\nit still is able to keep time.\n\n216\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.490\nAnd that's because there's a small\nbattery that keeps that particular\n\n217\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.020\nclock element active.\n\n218\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.030\nAnd so that's what goes on.\n\n219\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:37.780\nBut there's also a software clock\nthat's in there too, okay and that\n\n220\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:43.780\nidea of the software clock is also helpful\nbecause it actually does allow us then to\n\n221\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:49.030\ncommunicate with somebody else to be able\nto get a more accurate time if we need to.\n\n222\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.640\nSo those are the two elements that\nare on the router by itself and\n\n223\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.820\nwhen we first see it.\n\n224\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.390\nNow, just when we think\nthat that's enough,\n\n225\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.980\nthere's actually another command\nthat we can type in here, show clock\n\n226\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.440\ndetails or detail, excuse me,\ngotta get that one right.\n\n227\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.430\nAnd now you can also see\nsomething else as well.\n\n228\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.155\nNotice what this actually\nreports to us now, Zach.\n\n229\n00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:12.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.040\n&gt;&gt; So since I've been talking,\n\n231\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.878\nat least from three minutes ago-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n232\n00:12:15.878 --> 00:12:19.090\nright.\n&gt;&gt; It shows you what the time source\n\n233\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.320\nactually is, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.310\nAnd you can see where the way it actually\nreported was hardware, and then instead of\n\n235\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.390\nclock it said, like I told you-\n&gt;&gt; Calendar.\n\n236\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Calendar instead.\n\n237\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.650\nSo this is saying hey,\nwhen you actually typed in show clock,\n\n238\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.370\nI gave you this approximation\nof UTC time and what it did.\n\n239\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.340\nAnd where did I get that?\n\n240\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.420\nWell, I got it from the hardware clock.\n\n241\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.780\nIn other words, the one that is\nkept in the hardware at that point.\n\n242\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.050\nAnd notice, once again,\nit's still in that asterisk because\n\n243\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.000\nthat hardware clock is just giving you\nan approximation of what it believes.\n\n244\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.570\nIt doesn't know who to check\nwith to verify its own accuracy.\n\n245\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:01.110\nSo, it doesn't say, it's authoritative,\nit just says this is the best that I have\n\n246\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.320\nthat the hardware clock is telling me and\nthat's what we're also seeing there, too.\n\n247\n00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.640\nSo, it reveals our time\nsource when we do that.\n\n248\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.530\nNow, you and I can change this but\nbefore we change it, okay, if we wanted to\n\n249\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.870\nstart doing some type of coordination\nmanually and that's actually what I'm\n\n250\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.690\nsetting up here too, if we wanted to start\ndoing something manually in this way,\n\n251\n00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.780\nwhere we want to coordinate with another\ndevice, well, we can easily do so, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.720\nBut at the same time,\nyou do have to realize something here.\n\n253\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.050\nMost of us,\nespecially let's say right here,\n\n254\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.920\nI'm very time centered in terms of\nthis timezone that I'm in, right?\n\n255\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.460\nWhich is, for us now, the Eastern Daylight\nTime as of the recording that we're doing.\n\n256\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.370\nSo, when I normally configure something\nlike this, I may go ahead and\n\n257\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.310\nactually type in,\nlet me make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n258\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.470\nOkay, which is clock set.\n\n259\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.730\nAnd I'll do a question mark here.\n\n260\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.640\nAnd notice that it's giving me the format\nthat I should also type in as well, so\n\n261\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.070\nI type in clock set.\n\n262\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.130\nAnd now it says, hey, what's the hour,\nminute and seconds here that I get to?\n\n263\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.330\nWell, Zach,\nthat's only this portion of it, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.340\nWell, what about these out here?\n\n265\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.240\nThat's not actually giving me anything\ntowards the tenth, the hundredth and\n\n266\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.830\nthe thousandths of a second for\nme to try and coordinate anything to, so\n\n267\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.860\nthat's as close as I can get,\nessentially up to the second.\n\n268\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.540\nWhich doesn't sound like too bad.\n\n269\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.640\nBut it, also again, depends on how\naccurate your logging messages need to be.\n\n270\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.740\nSo I can actually do something like\nthis and show you that as well, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.010\nSo the reason why I'm actually showing\nyou this is because as we set this up,\n\n272\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.420\nthere's a best practice in\nterms of what Cisco says.\n\n273\n00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.216\nWe don't want to set it to our local time,\nso right now, right UTC,\n\n274\n00:14:49.216 --> 00:14:53.890\nwe generally think of it as actually being\nwhere the GMT, the Greenwich Mean Time\n\n275\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.340\nactually goes into but technically,\nit's not exactly the same.\n\n276\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.050\nSo what they recommend is that\nwhen you set up the clock,\n\n277\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.230\njust like what we're typing here, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.960\nSo this is as close and\nwe're gonna get that close as well.\n\n279\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.230\nLet me do a show clock again,\njust to make sure, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.840\nShow clock and this is one of\nthose unusual commands right now,\n\n281\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.550\nthat if we actually do set up the clock,\n\n282\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.870\nnotice that I don't have to go into\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n283\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.180\nI can do clock set and then I can do 17,\n\n284\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.390\nwhich is that time, 35 and then 48.\n\n285\n00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.670\nAnd let's do 49,\nprobably 50 by now cuz I keep talking.\n\n286\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.380\nOkay?\n\n287\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.350\nSo, now let me do that.\n\n288\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.960\nNow, it's actually saying hey,\nRonnie, you're close but\n\n289\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.550\nyou haven't set up everything yet.\n\n290\n00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.510\nSo, show clock.\n\n291\n00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.080\nLet me repeat that again.\n\n292\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.410\nI'm gonna be way far off now but\nthat's fine.\n\n293\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.768\nAnd paste that,\nI tried to do it down here.\n\n294\n00:15:48.768 --> 00:15:51.824\nPaste in the right place here,\nlet's go ahead and do another one, so\n\n295\n00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:52.570\nthat we can see.\n\n296\n00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.757\nNow it's actually saying,\nyou need also day, month and year.\n\n297\n00:15:55.757 --> 00:15:57.702\nSo it actually does give us that too.\n\n298\n00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:02.700\nSo today it's supposed to be the 19th,\nand then the month is gonna be March, and\n\n299\n00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.351\nthen probably the year, 2018,\nthat's what they're talking about.\n\n300\n00:16:07.351 --> 00:16:11.460\nSo it would actually be that\nentire thing again, let me not.\n\n301\n00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:19.719\nAnd we'll just kind of estimate this now\nand let's say this is now 36 at this\n\n302\n00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:22.998\npoint because I just keep talking.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:25.401\n&gt;&gt; It's all right we're not actually doing\n\n304\n00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.640\nmuch of that.\n\n305\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:33.021\nSo what did I say, day was 19,\nand then month was March,\n\n306\n00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:36.937\noops, March, and then 2018.\n\n307\n00:16:36.937 --> 00:16:40.802\nAll right, so\nnotice that it actually did take that for\n\n308\n00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:44.140\nwhat we actually wanted to be able to do.\n\n309\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.140\nSo when we set it though, we actually do\nneed to pay attention here to do that.\n\n310\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.930\nAnd now look,\nit actually gives me an update, okay?\n\n311\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.150\nSo it says system clock has been updated,\nbut notice that I left it in here, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.890\nInstead, which is at UTC, and\nthat's what Cisco calls best practice.\n\n313\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.970\nWhen you set the clock, don't set\nit to your own local time zone, but\n\n314\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.480\nset it up to UTC time.\n\n315\n00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.270\nAnd when you do something like that,\nthen you can adjust it by\n\n316\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.430\nadding in the time zone.\n&gt;&gt; And that might answer my question.\n\n317\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.330\nI was saying, well why wouldn't\nit be 13 because it's after 1.\n\n318\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:22.113\nWhy wouldn't it be 13, the 17 is the UTC.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so that's the best practice.\n\n319\n00:17:22.113 --> 00:17:25.640\nNow a lot of us don't follow the idea\nof the best practice, right?\n\n320\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.280\nWhat we do is, we just put it for\nour own time zone And then when it comes,\n\n321\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.046\nlike we readjust it and then we see\nthat it adjusted the clock earlier, and\n\n322\n00:17:33.046 --> 00:17:34.531\nthen we go back and we fix it.\n\n323\n00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:39.151\nBut the best practice is this, at least\nfrom what Cisco documentation says,\n\n324\n00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:40.325\nset it to UTC time.\n\n325\n00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:44.912\nWhich I'm not gonna be able to say,\nand then adjust for\n\n326\n00:17:44.912 --> 00:17:48.423\nthe time zone after that instead, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:48.423 --> 00:17:51.738\nSo just realize that that is a part\nof what can happen as well, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:59.640\nSo let's do this again, show clock detail,\nand now notice the difference, right?\n\n329\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.930\nAt the very beginning when I\nactually did the same command, okay.\n\n330\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.080\nIt told me that the time source was what?\n\n331\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.860\nA hardware calendar, and\n\n332\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.542\nnow that I have manually set it,\nyou can now see, there it is.\n\n333\n00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:17.510\nI was gonna say the time source is\nnow a user configured, as well.\n\n334\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.270\nZach, do you notice\nanything else in comparison\n\n335\n00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.109\nto what we saw earlier with this?\n\n336\n00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:29.735\nBy chance.\n&gt;&gt; It's the complete time and\n\n337\n00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:31.703\ndate stamp.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n338\n00:18:31.703 --> 00:18:34.459\nnotice that there is actually something\nmissing at the beginning of [CROSSTALK].\n\n339\n00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:35.240\n&gt;&gt; The asterisk?\n\n340\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:35.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the asterisk.\n\n341\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.840\n&gt;&gt; The asterisk is gone, yeah.\n\n342\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.200\n&gt;&gt; So what does this mean?\n\n343\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.660\nWell, this now means,\nit's got something authoritative.\n\n344\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.770\nNow that the asterisk is gone, it is now\nsaying somebody else configured it and\n\n345\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.640\nhanded it to me,\nthey must know what they're talking about.\n\n346\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.890\nSo now it considers this authoritative,\nokay, is what ends up happening.\n\n347\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.520\nSo you can actually see where\nsomething like this can be done and\n\n348\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.880\nit shows you what ends up happening here.\n\n349\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.790\nNow, we're gonna be turning this thing\noff cuz I messed it up royally cuz\n\n350\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.530\nI don't exactly know what\nthe time actually is here.\n\n351\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.220\nBut just kind of realize that\nyou will see that, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.570\nSo, it is authoritative.\n\n353\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.760\nIf I type in show calendar now, as well,\n\n354\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.170\nnotice once again,\nthe asterisk is gone because now what?\n\n355\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.860\nA user has configured it, and\n\n356\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.720\nit actually believes that\neverything is good from that point.\n\n357\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:30.670\nNow, if we can also type in another\none in here, clock update-calendar.\n\n358\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.417\nCalendar, not calenar, calendar.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:36.270\n&gt;&gt; God, I can't spell, okay.\n\n360\n00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.630\nSo this particular command itself,\n\n361\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:46.300\nwhat it allows us to do is to sync up\nthe clock, and to update the calendar.\n\n362\n00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.050\nNow what does that mean?\n\n363\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.660\nThat means the clock, the software\nclock that I just configured, and\n\n364\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.720\nthe hardware clock will\nnow also be in sync.\n\n365\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.620\nSo before, it could be where I\nactually configured one, but\n\n366\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.645\nI didn't actually get\nthe other one synced up.\n\n367\n00:19:59.645 --> 00:20:02.769\nSo if you want to actually\nsync both of these up here,\n\n368\n00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.474\nyou can also do that as well.\n\n369\n00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:09.131\nNow if you go, look I don't want\nit to automatically do this,\n\n370\n00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:14.148\nI wanna manually set it,\nyou can actually type in if you choose to,\n\n371\n00:20:14.148 --> 00:20:16.490\nokay, which is set calendar.\n\n372\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.691\nNow I don't recommend that\nyou do this here, but\n\n373\n00:20:19.691 --> 00:20:22.620\nI mean that, maybe this one you can.\n\n374\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.080\nWell I'm lying to you then.\n\n375\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.450\nNo, there it goes, okay so no, this one\ndoes not give you that ability to do so,\n\n376\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.610\nso that was just me\nremembering the wrong one.\n\n377\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.442\nSo in some of the routers that you have,\nsome of the older routers, and\n\n378\n00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:33.786\nyou wanted to manually synch it,\n\n379\n00:20:33.786 --> 00:20:36.345\nyou could actually type in set\ncalendar and you could synch it.\n\n380\n00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:40.307\nBut this one apparently,\nthis 2911 does not want you to do that, so\n\n381\n00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.670\nyou will not be able to do so, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.162\nAll right, so once you get that setup and\n\n383\n00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:50.289\nit's now UTC time for\nour configuration here.\n\n384\n00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:56.149\nWhat we want to do then is now adjust for\nthat time offset for our time zone, so\n\n385\n00:20:56.149 --> 00:21:02.240\nthis is where we must go in to our\nglobal configuration terminal, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.433\nSo inside our global\nconfiguration terminal,\n\n387\n00:21:04.433 --> 00:21:07.501\nnotice that everything else we've\ndone it hasn't been that way,\n\n388\n00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:11.475\nit's only been in the privilege exec mode,\nwithout the config in the prompt, okay?\n\n389\n00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:16.515\nSo now though when we want to set up\nthe clock and the synchronization.\n\n390\n00:21:16.515 --> 00:21:20.418\nOr not the, yeah,\nthe UTC time, we do clock and\n\n391\n00:21:20.418 --> 00:21:26.150\nthen we do a question mark here so\nthen we can see a little bit more.\n\n392\n00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.605\nWhat we're going to set up for\nfirst is time zone, so\n\n393\n00:21:29.605 --> 00:21:36.060\nclock timezone.\n\n394\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.590\nOops, spell zone right,\nhows that, lets do that.\n\n395\n00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.910\nOkay, now it's asking me for\nwhat the word actually is.\n\n396\n00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.820\nNow, what you wanna do is you\nwanna o know those abbreviations.\n\n397\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.950\nNow, it used to give you a list of them,\nbut now it's just saying,\n\n398\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.980\nwhich one is it here.\n\n399\n00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:57.510\nSo, for us, clock timezone, and\nwe'll just do EDT for right now.\n\n400\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:03.915\nActually let's not do that,\nlet's do -5 hours for the standard time.\n\n401\n00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:07.829\nOops, you know,\nI have to remember this, timezone -5.\n\n402\n00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:12.400\nLet me do another question mark so\nI know what the configuration is.\n\n403\n00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.585\nIt gave me a name instead,\nsorry that's my fault.\n\n404\n00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:21.620\n[LAUGH] It's asking for a name of what\nI wanna call this, that is just me.\n\n405\n00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.618\nLet me get rid of that command and\nthen do it right.\n\n406\n00:22:23.618 --> 00:22:27.940\nClock timezone, and\n\n407\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:33.300\nwe'll call this EDT, and\nnow I can do that offset.\n\n408\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.630\nAnd this is gonna be,\nlet's say -5 at this point.\n\n409\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.367\nLet's just do eastern, yeah, and then.\n\n410\n00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:43.382\nCuz we're gonna offset it\nagain in a moment here.\n\n411\n00:22:43.382 --> 00:22:45.190\nAnd now it's telling me,\nhey what about the minutes?\n\n412\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.480\nThat's fine,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n413\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.185\nSo here you can now see where\nit's actually been updated here.\n\n414\n00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:54.335\nTo, let me see, let me zoom out, so\n\n415\n00:22:54.335 --> 00:22:59.694\nit took 5 hours off of the 17 and\nit changed it back to 12.\n\n416\n00:22:59.694 --> 00:23:02.390\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhy did I do that?\n\n417\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.860\nWhy didn't I just type in the minus four\nsince it's eastern daylight time instead.\n\n418\n00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:12.760\nBecause there's another one that you\ncan also add in which is clock and\n\n419\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.010\nlet's do a question mark again here.\n\n420\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.653\nNotice that there is this option,\nsummertime okay,\n\n421\n00:23:19.653 --> 00:23:24.240\nconfigure summertime\ndaylight savings time.\n\n422\n00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.670\nSo I could have manually set it but if I\nwanted to use this command which I did\n\n423\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:35.950\nbecause I wanted to show it to you okay,\nclock summer-time EDT.\n\n424\n00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.265\nCalling upon what I just set up here,\nas well.\n\n425\n00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:43.786\nOr I did EST, sorry, EST,\nand then from this point,\n\n426\n00:23:43.786 --> 00:23:47.820\nI need to make sure I type\nin the word recurring.\n\n427\n00:23:51.002 --> 00:23:54.997\nAnd that tells it that it's gonna\nrecur automatically every year, okay.\n\n428\n00:23:54.997 --> 00:23:59.422\nSo now, when we set it up\nWe can now take a look and\n\n429\n00:23:59.422 --> 00:24:02.634\nnoticed that it adjusted it from,\n\n430\n00:24:02.634 --> 00:24:06.020\nwhat we had set it on EST here.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n431\n00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.428\n&gt;&gt; And now it actually added in that one\n\n432\n00:24:08.428 --> 00:24:11.205\nhour again or EDT, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Military time.\n\n433\n00:24:11.205 --> 00:24:12.600\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so it actually gave us that\n\n434\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.580\nability to do so, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.110\nSo getting all that stuff set up,\nright, is a manual configuration of\n\n436\n00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:23.330\nwhat we need to be able to do if we\nwanted to do this manually, okay?\n\n437\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.498\nLet's do one more here.\n\n438\n00:24:24.498 --> 00:24:29.232\nShow clock detail.\n\n439\n00:24:32.457 --> 00:24:36.645\nAnd now you can actually see here,\nwhen we start to take a look, right?\n\n440\n00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:41.390\nAt the time source, once again,\nis user configured.\n\n441\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.805\nNotice that there's no asterisk which\nmeans it considers it authoritative.\n\n442\n00:24:44.805 --> 00:24:45.383\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n443\n00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:48.277\n&gt;&gt; It actually even tells us when\n\n444\n00:24:48.277 --> 00:24:54.080\nthe actual summer time,\nthe daylight savings time began.\n\n445\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.830\nAnd then it even says, when it ends\nto add that hour back in, okay?\n\n446\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.550\nSo it's actually pretty good in thinking\nand taking a look at all of the way\n\n447\n00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.410\nthat we can configure this to make it\nwork the way that we need to, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.640\nSo this is essentially\na manual configuration and\n\n449\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.740\nwhat does this mean, Zach?\n\n450\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.240\nAnd you're probably saying,\nwell what's the big deal?\n\n451\n00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.410\nThe big deal is, if I have 5 routers, if\nI have 10 routers, if I have 15 routers,\n\n452\n00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.510\nthis is a lot of configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n453\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.480\nit would be.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n454\n00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.950\nit is a ton of configuration to do.\n\n455\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.640\nSo instead there's a better way for\nus to do this, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.540\nSo I showed you all that,\nbecause there is some material in there\n\n457\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.910\nthat you'll need to understand for\nthe exam.\n\n458\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.700\nAnd getting that set up,\nbut at the same time,\n\n459\n00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.560\nI wanna show you that there's a lot of\nsetup just in setting up the time and\n\n460\n00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.200\na lot of understanding\nthat you have to have too.\n\n461\n00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.680\nSo what we're gonna do though, and\n\n462\n00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.570\nwhat officially is called\nout on the exam itself,\n\n463\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:54.130\nis on configuring network time protocol,\nthat not only allows me to take a router.\n\n464\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.220\nAnd get it configured from\nsomebody else running NTP, but\n\n465\n00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.010\nalso then set up my own time server\n\n466\n00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:04.830\nthat will allow the configuration of other\ndevices to be configured by me as well.\n\n467\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.290\nAnd that way I don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n468\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.330\nSo once we get all that set up,\nwe'll understand this idea a lot better.\n\n469\n00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.200\nAnd then all of our devices will be\nsynced up and authoritative too.\n\n470\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.210\nSo Zach, we definitely need to do that and\n\n471\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.490\nwe need to jump into it and I noticed\nthat we're running out of time here.\n\n472\n00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.810\nSo this would be great for another part,\ninstead of me trying to cram it all in,\n\n473\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:28.130\nlast two or three minutes of this episode.\n&gt;&gt; Configure and verify NTP,\n\n474\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.420\nwonderful episode and they're will be\na part two, make sure you see them both.\n\n475\n00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.505\nBefore we move on though,\n\n476\n00:26:32.505 --> 00:26:34.360\nRonnie do you have any last words?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n477\n00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.140\nthis is one of the harder elements to\nunderstand in the graph, because you saw\n\n478\n00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.000\nhow many parts there is to it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n479\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.250\n&gt;&gt; And it's not that you have to\n\n480\n00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.980\nunderstand and\nmaster it all right now, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.830\nBut you do need to at least understand\nthat there's a manual way to do this and\n\n482\n00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:48.440\nyou saw that.\n\n483\n00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.890\nYou saw that process and\nthe way that it is and\n\n484\n00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.710\nI showed you some of those elements.\n\n485\n00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.850\nBut we're about to show you the official\nway that most people would actually do\n\n486\n00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.200\nthis when they have more than one router\nto have to contend with and deal with.\n\n487\n00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.360\nAnd that's what you want to get into.\n\n488\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.012\nSo take a look and\nwe'll have these lab steps for\n\n489\n00:27:05.012 --> 00:27:09.717\nyou in part of the notes as well, but just\nmake sure that you begin again, practice,\n\n490\n00:27:09.717 --> 00:27:13.192\npractice, practice at this point,\nyou should be waking up.\n\n491\n00:27:13.192 --> 00:27:18.070\nAnd you should be waking up and going,\nI want to practice my Cisco commands.\n\n492\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.270\nI want to practice typing this stuff in.\n\n493\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.490\nI wanna understand these concepts\nbetter and better and better.\n\n494\n00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.330\nAnd you've actually got to have that kind\nof drive that gets you there every morning\n\n495\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.500\nwhen you do so.\n\n496\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.640\nBecause right now we're getting\nclose to end of this series and\n\n497\n00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.840\nthat means you're almost ready then and\nalso for the exam that means\n\n498\n00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.150\nyou need to drive harder in that practice.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, Ronnie, thanks very much.\n\n499\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.140\nCisco CCENT, it's a wonderful series\nmake sure you watch every episode.\n\n500\n00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.520\nYou'll be glad you did and\nyou'll be in the course library.\n\n501\n00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.920\nThere's thousands of other videos there\nand they're designed to do one thing,\n\n502\n00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.310\nhelp you go further.\n\n503\n00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.000\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n504\n00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.230\nITProTV is binge worthy,\nthanks for watching.\n\n505\n00:27:56.230 -->

00:00:10.342\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:13.399\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.026\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:20.020\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\nthis episode, Cysco C set.\n\n7\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.100\nWe're gonna configure and verify NTP part\ntwo, part two, make sure you see part one.\n\n8\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.206\nAnd the person that's bringing all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n9\n00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:29.340\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.008\nRonnie good to see you again sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach thank you again for\n\n11\n00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.246\nhaving me on the show as we\ncontinue on in our part two\n\n12\n00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:34.881\nhere on NTP.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n13\n00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.845\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time people are probably\n\n14\n00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:38.220\ngoing, are you joking,\n\n15\n00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.983\nit was just setting up a clock.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:41.188\n&gt;&gt; What does it really matter\n\n17\n00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:42.780\nthat there's more than one part.\n\n18\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.462\nAnd, well, its because we showed\nyou in the first part here, right.\n\n19\n00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.838\nHow to manually configure that clock so\n\n20\n00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:51.582\nthat we could get it at least\nsynced up between the hardware and\n\n21\n00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:53.500\nthe software clock.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n22\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.727\n&gt;&gt; But, that's how you'd have to do that,\n\n23\n00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:55.473\nif you wanted to, okay.\n\n24\n00:00:55.473 --> 00:01:00.550\nBut it doesn't mean that they\nfunction together with other devices.\n\n25\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.896\nBut those particular concepts\nthat we showed you about, and\n\n26\n00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:07.315\nconfigurations that we showed\nyou are key elements, right.\n\n27\n00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:09.900\nIf you need to do this on your own.\n\n28\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.361\nSo make sure that you look at them and\n\n29\n00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.474\nunderstand that there is\na manual configuration.\n\n30\n00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:18.569\nBut the problem that we have is one that\nI kept describing thru-out that part 1\n\n31\n00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:24.420\nseries is that the manual configuration by\nsomeone like me or you as well as a human.\n\n32\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.042\nWell, we can't account very easily for\nthe idea of time drift or\n\n33\n00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:31.193\ntechnically clock drift of.\n\n34\n00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:35.066\nI always wanting to say something else,\nI call it time slippage but\n\n35\n00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.670\nI think the technical term is clock drift,\nall right.\n\n36\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.980\nAnd that's the idea, right?\n\n37\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.665\nIf I go to one router and\nI configure it, and\n\n38\n00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:47.488\nI set up everything like I did in Part 1\nwhere all of the set that way I want to.\n\n39\n00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:50.968\nBy the time I switch on over to\nanother router and then try and\n\n40\n00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:55.296\ncompare that and try and configure out\nit again has already drifted time.\n\n41\n00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:59.667\nAnd if I set the exact same time again I'm\nprobably off by seconds, at least for me,\n\n42\n00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.970\nif not minutes the way that I talk and\nI configure things.\n\n43\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.544\nBut overall though that's\nwhat you want to avoid.\n\n44\n00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:07.908\nSo with humans just doing it,\n\n45\n00:02:07.908 --> 00:02:13.550\nwe'll probably get be off in terms\nof time settings that we do.\n\n46\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.460\nJust because of the human nature that we\nare in moving from one device to another.\n\n47\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.733\nForgetting one element, not remembering\nthat we set this, not doing that,\n\n48\n00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:24.060\nhaving to go back and change it.\n\n49\n00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.889\nTrying to configure it,\nit can cause some errors, okay,\n\n50\n00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.333\nafter a while,\nespecially if you need accuracy.\n\n51\n00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.063\nSo what we want to talk about\nthen is how we do we deal\n\n52\n00:02:32.063 --> 00:02:36.270\nwith this idea of some of these\nmicro-details, like we showed you.\n\n53\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.955\nAnd when you type in Show Clock, right,\n\n54\n00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.347\nit shows probably out to the ten\nthousandths of a second.\n\n55\n00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:44.040\nYou and I can't configure\nthat exactly very easily.\n\n56\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.829\nAnd even then,\n\n57\n00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.396\neven if we could, that means that there's\nstill a 10,000 seconds that may be off.\n\n58\n00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:55.170\nWhich can add up over time and after\na while it can add up into seconds too.\n\n59\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.059\nSo just kinda realize that\nall of that is possible.\n\n60\n00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:02.144\nSo what we want is a system,\nokay, or something that allows\n\n61\n00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:07.950\nus to have essentially the idea\nof a regular time update, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.911\nIn other words it actually is regular or\nrepeatable in what it does,\n\n63\n00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:13.307\nin terms of the update.\n\n64\n00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:18.250\nIt's not like me, did I configure that\none, or did I not configure that one?\n\n65\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.680\nDid it work?\nDid it not work?\n\n66\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.675\nWhat happened here?\n\n67\n00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:21.880\nWhat went on, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.605\nSo I want something that is regular.\n\n69\n00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:27.385\nI also want the idea of something that\nis periodic, okay, as well, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:29.948\nNow repeatable, and\nconsistent, the regularity is,\n\n71\n00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:31.592\nof course the idea of consistency.\n\n72\n00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:34.370\nThe idea of being periodic is repeatable.\n\n73\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.083\nAnd then the ability to\nsynchronize between those devices,\n\n74\n00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:42.610\nwithout me having to interact too\nmuch with the devices, as well, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.350\nAnd the way that we do that is\nthrough what we call NTP, or\n\n76\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.980\nNetwork Time Protocol, okay.\n\n77\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.235\nNTP allows us to handle\nthe synchronization.\n\n78\n00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:55.014\nAnd actually,\neven better than just the idea of\n\n79\n00:03:55.014 --> 00:03:58.760\nsynchronizing between just\ndevices in the network.\n\n80\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.985\nIt can allow us to also handle the time\nsynchronizations across networks that\n\n81\n00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:04.419\ndon't account for time.\n\n82\n00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.830\nAnd you might be saying,\nwell what networks would that be?\n\n83\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.780\nThat'd be essentially the entire Internet.\n\n84\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.976\nThe Internet doesn't care about\nthe way that your log messages appear,\n\n85\n00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:16.960\nif they're accurate or not, but you do.\n\n86\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.154\nAnd when we actually\nwant to sync up something\n\n87\n00:04:20.154 --> 00:04:24.364\nwith another device outside\nof our own networks, as well.\n\n88\n00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.192\nIt can cause some drift as well,\n\n89\n00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:30.530\nbecause those are particular\ndifferent networks that we go across.\n\n90\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.886\nSo, in that sense, right, if it goes from\none that worked us really fast to another\n\n91\n00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:38.333\nnetwork that's fairly slow to\nanother network that's, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:41.760\nAnd fast again, and then back to you,\nif that happens, right?\n\n93\n00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.124\nWhat that means that your time reporting\nthrough those networks, it can change,\n\n94\n00:04:46.124 --> 00:04:48.034\nit can be variable, it can do that.\n\n95\n00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:52.826\nSo what if you are synchronizing to clock\nout there on the Internet somewhere for\n\n96\n00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:55.560\nyour router even for your own desktop.\n\n97\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.137\nWell, how does it know to keep it\nconsistent and how does it do that?\n\n98\n00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:01.230\nAnd that's usually because\nof the way that NTP works.\n\n99\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.157\nIt can synchronize even though\nthe networks are variable,\n\n100\n00:05:04.157 --> 00:05:05.747\nin the way that they relay time.\n\n101\n00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:10.270\nSo if you're running a Windows machine,\nokay, as a Windows desktop.\n\n102\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.934\nYou've seen the ability, if your network\nallows you to synchronize your own machine\n\n103\n00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.886\nto a time clock out on the Internet.\n\n104\n00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:21.704\nOkay, you've seen that, and\nactually usually it says time.Windows.com.\n\n105\n00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:23.464\nA kindment, a kindment,\n\n106\n00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:28.730\na common [LAUGH] time synchronization\nclock that's out on the Internet.\n\n107\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.780\nWell, that's not directly\nconnected to your network,\n\n108\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.982\nit's somewhere on this planet.\n\n109\n00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.544\nI don't know exactly where\nit's on this planet but\n\n110\n00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:38.012\nit has to go across multiple hops\nbefore it gets to you and comes back.\n\n111\n00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:41.370\nSo that's something that you've\ngot to be able to account for.\n\n112\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.616\nAnd that's something that NTP accounts for\nus,\n\n113\n00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:45.822\nso that we don't have to worry about it,\nokay?\n\n114\n00:05:45.822 --> 00:05:47.254\nSo how does it do it, and\n\n115\n00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:51.830\nwhy do we actually tend to get our time\nsynchronization from the Internet.\n\n116\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.935\nAnd why is that actually better\nthan Ronnie just kind of guessing.\n\n117\n00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:58.871\nAnd going that's what I heard on the radio\ntoday it was closed that time, okay.\n\n118\n00:05:58.871 --> 00:05:59.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n119\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.945\n&gt;&gt; Well, the reason why is,\n\n120\n00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:05.241\nlet's go ahead and take a look at my\nscreen and this should help us out, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.618\nSo out on the internet, okay,\nand actually out on the world and\n\n122\n00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.310\nin the governments and the worlds, okay.\n\n123\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.634\nThere's what we call of\n\n124\n00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:14.954\ncourse NTP stratums that can help us out.\n\n125\n00:06:14.954 --> 00:06:16.293\n&gt;&gt; Stratums?\n&gt;&gt; Stratums.\n\n126\n00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n127\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, each one of course a stratosphere\n\n128\n00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:20.393\nof some sort if you want\nto call it that way.\n\n129\n00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:21.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n130\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.635\n&gt;&gt; A layer of things.\n\n131\n00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:27.738\nNow for us, we as networks and\ndevices will never sync up\n\n132\n00:06:27.738 --> 00:06:34.560\nto kind of the ultimate stratum,\nitself, which is stratum zero.\n\n133\n00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.814\nStratum zeros are actually the atomic\ntime clocks that exist, and\n\n134\n00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.734\nusually held in government\nfacilities somewhere, okay.\n\n135\n00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:45.171\nYou and I are never gonna actually have\nour machine essentially sync up exactly to\n\n136\n00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.894\nthat particular time clock.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n137\n00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:49.250\n&gt;&gt; And so, can you?\n\n138\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.252\nWell, it depends, it really does depend.\n\n139\n00:06:51.252 --> 00:06:56.164\nSo in the United States you do have a link\nthat says, here it is actually synced\n\n140\n00:06:56.164 --> 00:06:59.660\nto the atomic time clock of\nthe US Navy and what it does.\n\n141\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.465\nWhich you can do, but it doesn't work that\nway through NTP, NTP uses stratum share.\n\n142\n00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:08.314\nThe other things of course that\nare also in this synchronization\n\n143\n00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:11.960\nlayer is the GPS satellites that\nare out there on the planet.\n\n144\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.562\nWell, what does this actually\nmean as stratum zero?\n\n145\n00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:17.801\nThat means between all these devices and\n\n146\n00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:22.380\nstratum zero there is very little,\nif any delays at all.\n\n147\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.468\nIn other words, all of those\nclocks on every GPS satellite and\n\n148\n00:07:26.468 --> 00:07:28.285\non the atomic time clocks.\n\n149\n00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:33.404\nIf there's any sort of time\ndrift at all it is negligible,\n\n150\n00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:37.920\nit doesn't affect anything that we do.\n\n151\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.076\nSo that is something that happens.\n\n152\n00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:41.349\nNow what happens,\n\n153\n00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:46.540\nof course then is that around the world\nwith NTP there's also other stratum.\n\n154\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.546\nThere's actually stratums one through 16,\nokay.\n\n155\n00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:55.315\nNow, I set this up in this way to\nallow us to realize something, okay.\n\n156\n00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:59.290\nEvery stratum essentially\ndepends on the stratum above it.\n\n157\n00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.040\nSo stratum 1-16 is probably\nactually on equal layers\n\n158\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.580\nall the way connecting to Stratum 0,\nbut they can actually do this.\n\n159\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.340\nSo, stratum 2 is actually dependent\non stratum 1 as well, and so\n\n160\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.740\nforth and so on okay, as you do this.\n\n161\n00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.120\nSo in stratum 2, though, okay,\nusually stratum 1 is actually saying what?\n\n162\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.721\nWe're synced up to Stratum 0, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:29.110\nAnd then all the rest of these in stratums\n2-16, they have their own time servers.\n\n164\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.090\nThey first, of course,\ninitially sync up to stratum 1,\n\n165\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.430\nbut after that though,\nthey also sync up to each other.\n\n166\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.700\nOkay, and their primary device\nis that there's one of those.\n\n167\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.790\nAnd each one of those stratum at least or\n\n168\n00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.590\nwhatever layer that's actually within\neach one, that does sync up to stratum 1.\n\n169\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.240\nBut the rest of these really they do\nprovide synchronization among each other.\n\n170\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.780\nSo that these time servers\nas they sync to each other,\n\n171\n00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.240\nnormally these are the ones\nthat we on our own networks,\n\n172\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.870\nwe would actually run a link to sync\nup to stratum 2 through 16, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.980\nSo can you sync up to stratum 1?\n\n174\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.760\nYes, technically you can.\n\n175\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.179\nBut a lot of times if you just\nlet NTP do what it wants to do,\n\n176\n00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:14.049\nyou can actually sync up to any\nof these through 2 through 16.\n\n177\n00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:18.626\nIn theory, 16 should be, of course,\nmore removed from stratum 1, but\n\n178\n00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:21.930\nat the same time,\nyou just don't know, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.781\nSo a lot of times, depending on what\ntypes of devices you're connecting to,\n\n180\n00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:31.499\nyou may find out that certain NTP clocks\nthat are out there on the Internet.\n\n181\n00:09:31.499 --> 00:09:34.012\nThey're actually at certain\ndifferent stratums and\n\n182\n00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:37.079\nusually the one that's closer to\nyou is probably the better one,\n\n183\n00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:40.810\nnot reaching out to the one that's\non another continent than you.\n\n184\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.460\nBut the one that's closest to\nyou is actually the better one.\n\n185\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.403\nSo if the ones that are closest to you\nonly are, let's say stratum three or\n\n186\n00:09:48.403 --> 00:09:51.294\nfour, that may actually be what you want.\n\n187\n00:09:51.294 --> 00:09:54.750\nThe one that's halfway across the world so\nlike from us, here in Florida and\n\n188\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.020\nthe United States.\n\n189\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.756\nIf there was a stratum server in\nAntarctica, that was stratum 2, I may go,\n\n190\n00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:04.678\nI don't think I want to go all\nthe way to Antarctica to get my time\n\n191\n00:10:04.678 --> 00:10:05.942\nsynchronization.\n\n192\n00:10:05.942 --> 00:10:06.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you?\n\n193\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.700\nYes, but overall that probably\nthe one that's closest to you is\n\n194\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.960\nprobably a little bit more\naccurate in that sense.\n\n195\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.730\nSo these stratums are actually\npart of the entire system and\n\n196\n00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.980\nthat's what we normally would do, is that\nwe would sync up one device in our network\n\n197\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.060\nwith one of these stratums up here.\n&gt;&gt; So can you set your router so that they\n\n198\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.360\nautomatically sync to the stratum?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can, okay, so\n\n199\n00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.500\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n200\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.704\nWe're going to at least show\nyou how this done, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:30.704 --> 00:10:31.536\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n202\n00:10:31.536 --> 00:10:33.759\n&gt;&gt; But we're not going to actually do\n\n203\n00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:36.680\nexcept for\none at this point to show you that.\n\n204\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.375\nSo what we're gonna do is, we're gonna\nset up what we call a NTP server.\n\n205\n00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:45.910\nAn NTP server for us allows other\ndevices to sync to itself or is time\n\n206\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.640\nsynchronization and normally, at least for\nyou and me, I drew this dotted line here.\n\n207\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.690\nThis is really all we're\n\n208\n00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.150\ncaring about right now.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n209\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.155\n&gt;&gt; Are these devices inside of our network\n\n210\n00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.540\nsynced up?\n\n211\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.640\nNot so much whether or\nnot they're synced up to the time servers.\n\n212\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.510\nNow, don't get me wrong having\nthe accurate time is pretty darn cool.\n\n213\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.760\nBut in terms of legality,\nin terms of us getting good logs and\n\n214\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.010\neverything, we just want to\nmake sure that our network.\n\n215\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.620\nAnd what we're responsible for\nin our own autonomous system,\n\n216\n00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.130\nis sync the way that we want to, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, perfect.\n\n217\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.425\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're doing.\n\n218\n00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:19.920\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do this.\n\n219\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.200\nWe're gonna set up this server mode first.\n\n220\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.660\nSo if I go back here to our practice labs,\nin the same lab that I was just in for\n\n221\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.112\npart one, configure and\nverifying NTP operations, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:31.112 --> 00:11:35.340\nWe are gonna use NYEDGE1 and we're gonna\nshow you some of the same commands that we\n\n223\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.720\njust ran inside the part one\nof this episode as well, okay?\n\n224\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.820\nNow, lemme make sure\nthat we get access here.\n\n225\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.390\nSo let's take a look at the clock here.\n\n226\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.410\nSo I'm just gonna type in\nshow clock at this point.\n\n227\n00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.659\nAnd once again we get\nthe verification here,\n\n228\n00:11:55.659 --> 00:11:59.860\nthe hey look it's now\na different hour it's 18:05.\n\n229\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:05.630\nAccording to UTCs time what we're actually\nseeing it which is perfectly fine, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.900\nNow, let's go ahead and\nconfigure something else.\n\n231\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.397\nSo I'm gonna get into\nprivilege exec mode and\n\n232\n00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:16.540\nthen into my global configuration\nmode as well, all right.\n\n233\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:22.298\nSo within the global configuration\nmode here, our labs right now,\n\n234\n00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:27.550\nwhere they're actually residing,\nthey are actually on some\n\n235\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:33.123\nDallas farm somewhere else which\nis actually in England, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:33.123 --> 00:12:37.122\nOur particular data center that\nwe're connected to and practice on,\n\n237\n00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:37.627\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n238\n00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:38.851\n&gt;&gt; Where our partners are.\n\n239\n00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:40.846\nThey're actually over\nin England somewhere.\n\n240\n00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:44.740\nOkay, so we're gonna send this up the way\nthat lab has it set up which is to\n\n241\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.740\nhave it itself synchronized to a clock.\n\n242\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.580\nAnd we're gonna set up the time zone.\n\n243\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.452\nOkay, now we are not gonna worry\nabout setting up the time rate,\n\n244\n00:12:57.452 --> 00:13:00.189\ncuz we already have a time\nthat it is set up to.\n\n245\n00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:05.026\nBut we are gonna set up a clock\ntime zone and then we're gonna do\n\n246\n00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:11.140\nGreenwich Mean Time and then 0,\nis what we're going to do here, okay?\n\n247\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.331\nSo that is actually just setting it\nup saying look we're not off setting\n\n248\n00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:15.520\nanything.\n\n249\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.790\nSo we're just gonna line it up to\nthat particular time, all right?\n\n250\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.030\nSo that shouldn't change the clock at\nall when you hit enter a couple of times\n\n251\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.030\nthere, and you'll see where it\nactually does match up GMT to UTC, and\n\n252\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.103\nthat's perfectly fine.\n&gt;&gt; Then from this point,\n\n253\n00:13:31.103 --> 00:13:35.734\nthey also follow the daylight savings\ntime, so we'll do summer time.\n\n254\n00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:42.250\nAnd this time,\nI don't know what to call it.\n\n255\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.627\nI'll just call it summer-time or\nI don't know what they call it,\n\n256\n00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:51.672\nor just call it GMT again or\nGMT 2, I don't know.\n\n257\n00:13:51.672 --> 00:13:53.133\nI'm gonna just do GMT.\n\n258\n00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:56.950\nI'm trying to think of what they call it,\ncuz ours is Eastern Daylight Time.\n\n259\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.088\nI don't know if there's a Greenwich\ndaylight time or not, there may be, but\n\n260\n00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:01.597\nI don't know if that's true or not.\n\n261\n00:14:01.597 --> 00:14:07.110\nAnd then we'll do recurring and let's\nhit the question mark here too, okay?\n\n262\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.990\nNow, this is something that we didn't\ndo when I was showing it a little bit\n\n263\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.650\nearlier here.\n\n264\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.320\nI did a question mark, because notice\n\n265\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.890\nthat they actually do show that there is\nsomething else that may also happen too.\n\n266\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.420\nWhen does it begin recurring, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.350\nNow we just set up recurring, we told it\nto pick when it naturally does it, but\n\n268\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.750\nif I'm want to set it up,\nnotice I can actually tell it when.\n\n269\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.040\nThe first week of the month or\nthe last week of the month and\n\n270\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.560\nin our configuration,\nthe way that they have this set up.\n\n271\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.213\nIs that they have it recurring\nat the last week of the month.\n\n272\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:49.375\nSo we're gonna type in\nrecurring last here and\n\n273\n00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:53.040\nthis says incomplete command.\n\n274\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.230\nAll right, so let's try it again.\n\n275\n00:14:57.545 --> 00:14:58.530\nSo what else did I miss?\n\n276\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:04.428\nLast, let's see, last day.\n\n277\n00:15:04.428 --> 00:15:07.740\nIt says weekday to start, well, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.620\nWell, there we go.\n\n279\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:17.519\nLast, let's do Monday [LAUGH]\nmake that there's nothing else there.\n\n280\n00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.170\nNo, there's actually even more, Month.\n\n281\n00:15:21.628 --> 00:15:24.631\nSo let's do this, cuz I don't\nwanna actually continue to try and\n\n282\n00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:25.870\ntype that out.\n\n283\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.950\nSo whatever they actually had set up,\napparently I did not copy correctly,\n\n284\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.980\nlet's just do that.\n\n285\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.340\nSo notice it actually accepts it.\n\n286\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.600\nYou can get very detailed\nin what it does here,\n\n287\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.870\nwe're not gonna worry about doing that.\n\n288\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.450\nSo I have it where it actually\ncontinues to go out here,\n\n289\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.001\nbut we're not gonna do that, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n290\n00:15:40.001 --> 00:15:40.636\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n291\n00:15:40.636 --> 00:15:44.446\nso now once we have that right,\nwe're now just kinda saying all right,\n\n292\n00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:46.790\nhere's what the clock is set to.\n\n293\n00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.280\nNow, I want this to become\nthe NTP server for my network.\n\n294\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.689\nSo it's easy,\nntp master is what we want and\n\n295\n00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:57.830\nthen I'm gonna type in a question mark.\n\n296\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.374\nAnd notice here, we can now set up\nwhat stratum number we want this to\n\n297\n00:16:02.374 --> 00:16:05.429\nessentially become for what we want, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:07.700\nWhat stratum to actually end up using.\n\n299\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.260\nSo it enables the device to function\nas the NTP server, and now NTP\n\n300\n00:16:15.586 --> 00:16:19.640\nntp master, and then we'll just do a 1 for\nright now, which is fine.\n\n301\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.160\nSo notice, it takes it and\ndoesn't really seem to complain.\n\n302\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.330\nNow, the other one that we're also going\nto do here is that we can limit the number\n\n303\n00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:33.600\nof devices that sync up to me,\nor to NYEDGE1, as the master.\n\n304\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:40.620\nAnd the way that we also do this\none is we do ntp max-association.\n\n305\n00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:46.330\nAnd let me do a question mark.\n\n306\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:52.520\nNotice it actually shows me how many\ndevices are possible to sync up to, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.690\nSo it goes from zero all the way\nto about 4 billion, 4.3 billion,\n\n308\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.170\nsomewhere around there, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.850\nSo it is very possible that you\ncould actually end up doing that.\n\n310\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.393\nYeah, I was trying to make sure,\nactually it's more than one.\n\n311\n00:17:05.393 --> 00:17:09.180\nThere's one Now that is four, okay.\n\n312\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.359\nI just wanted to make sure I was right.\n\n313\n00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.015\nYeah, about about 4 billion possible\n\n314\n00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:12.760\ndevices.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.690\n&gt;&gt; So let's make sure that's a little bit\n\n316\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.763\nless here.\n\n317\n00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:19.489\nntp max-associations.\n\n318\n00:17:19.489 --> 00:17:22.690\nAnd we'll just set it for 10, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.716\nSo this actually tells us that only\nten other devices that are running ntp\n\n320\n00:17:26.716 --> 00:17:30.380\nare allowed to sync up to\nthis device right now.\n\n321\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.230\nNow, you might be wondering why\nthe heck would you limit this?\n\n322\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.621\nWell, you want to limit this especially\non routers because you don't want every\n\n323\n00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:42.223\nsingle device syncing up to your router,\nlike every work station, every desktop.\n\n324\n00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:44.000\nCan you?\nYes, okay?\n\n325\n00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.590\nBut in then the end, right,\nthat taxes that router a little bit more.\n\n326\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.770\nSo it's better if you only allow for\nother routers to sync up to this, too.\n\n327\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.640\nAnd this way,\nyou'll actually have that as well.\n\n328\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.890\nSo up to a maximum of ten NTP\nclients wind up using this.\n\n329\n00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.050\nNow, before we're done here,\n\n330\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.730\nokay, we also have one more thing\nthat we have to think about as well.\n\n331\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.175\nWe wanna actually designate which\ninterface you're gonna allow that\n\n332\n00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:10.517\nsynchronization to happen, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:10.517 --> 00:18:13.470\nFrom those clients into\nthe master as well.\n\n334\n00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:22.420\nSo it's here that we want\nInterface Actually, on line two.\n\n335\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.850\nIt's NTP, I'm reading the wrong line.\n\n336\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.697\nNTP source.\n\n337\n00:18:26.697 --> 00:18:32.049\nAnd then,\nit's gonna be gigabit Ethernet 0/0.\n\n338\n00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:36.060\nOkay?\n\n339\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.590\nNow, the nice thing about this, right?\n\n340\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.270\nIf I set it up this way, okay, I don't\nhave to set up an IP address on it.\n\n341\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:48.491\nWhat it will actually do, essentially\nby setting up NTP source gigabit\n\n342\n00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:54.059\nEthernet 0/0, is that it will take\nthe IP address that set on 0/0, and\n\n343\n00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:59.905\nthat will now become the IP address for\nall the NTP clients to connect to, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:02.780\nBecause it's actually referring\nto the interface itself.\n\n345\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.800\nSo it will also do that as well.\n\n346\n00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.970\nAll right, now, let's verify this and\nsee, show ntp status, at this point.\n\n347\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:17.260\nAnd now, you actually see there's\na lot of information here, too, okay?\n\n348\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.020\nSo configured from the console,\n\n349\n00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.830\nNTP status clock is synchronized\nin stratum one, okay?\n\n350\n00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.080\nNotice it says reference is still local,\nwhich is fine.\n\n351\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.930\nIt tells us the nominal frequency and\nthe actual frequency.\n\n352\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:37.650\nThe precision of the clock, the clock\noffset in milliseconds right now.\n\n353\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.150\nNothing, well,\nit's cuz it's itself, right?\n\n354\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.860\nThe root delay has nothing.\n\n355\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:47.168\nRoot dispersion, okay,\nis a 0.39 milliseconds.\n\n356\n00:19:47.168 --> 00:19:51.360\nPeer dispersion is 0.23 milliseconds.\n\n357\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.520\nLuke filter drift.\n\n358\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.159\nRight now, is there's no drift,\n\n359\n00:19:55.159 --> 00:19:58.000\nwhich is nice because there's\nno drift from the master.\n\n360\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.720\nThe reason why is because it is\nthe master, so it doesn't make any sense.\n\n361\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.200\nAnd then, the system pull interval is 16.\n\n362\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.502\nLast update ago was 12 seconds.\n\n363\n00:20:06.502 --> 00:20:07.350\nAll right, so\n\n364\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.470\na lot of information as we start to see\nwhat we are actually showing you, right?\n\n365\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.860\nBut that's not its only configuration.\n\n366\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.173\nThere's no good of this being\nan NTP master if there isn't\n\n367\n00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:19.855\na client to follow it.\n\n368\n00:20:19.855 --> 00:20:22.160\nIn other words,\na client to sync up to this.\n\n369\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.920\nSo that is our next configuration that\nwe also want to take a look at as well.\n\n370\n00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.170\nWe're going to use over on\nthe left-hand side NYCORE1.\n\n371\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.900\nI'm going to select NYCORE1.\n\n372\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.800\nAnd then,\nmake sure I can get access into it.\n\n373\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.050\nAnd now,\ntype in show clock just as an example.\n\n374\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:46.360\nNow, when we start to take a look at this,\nthis is absolutely different here, too.\n\n375\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.620\nNotice the date on this one that\nshows you, hey, something is wrong.\n\n376\n00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:56.370\nZach, can you see something wrong with\nthe print, the clock on this machine here?\n\n377\n00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.284\nIt is showing as March 1st, 1993.\n\n378\n00:20:59.284 --> 00:21:02.915\nThat should be a problem.\n&gt;&gt; Well, our data's a little off is all.\n\n379\n00:21:02.915 --> 00:21:04.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah a little off here, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:04.635\n&gt;&gt; A little wrong on the date.\n\n381\n00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:05.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little off.\n\n382\n00:21:05.165 --> 00:21:07.455\nAnd it's also showing\nabout 1:00 in the morning,\n\n383\n00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:08.745\nUTC time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n384\n00:21:08.745 --> 00:21:11.715\n&gt;&gt; So this clock is wrong obviously.\n\n385\n00:21:11.715 --> 00:21:15.035\nAnd that's what we want, cuz we want to\nsee if it actually does synchronize up\n\n386\n00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:17.165\nwhen we get everything here, okay?\n\n387\n00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:18.745\nSo noticing that is key.\n\n388\n00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:23.060\nAll right, once we are here,\nlet's go back in, and now,\n\n389\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.930\nwe're ready to configure this for\nan NTP client.\n\n390\n00:21:27.706 --> 00:21:30.358\nSo when we do this idea of the NTP client,\n\n391\n00:21:30.358 --> 00:21:34.740\nthis is where the language gets\na little bit muddled here, right?\n\n392\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.420\nCuz it gets a little bit\nbackward in this set.\n\n393\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.910\nSo this is where on the client,\nyou have to set up ntp server,\n\n394\n00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.940\nand then point it to\nthe correct IP address.\n\n395\n00:21:49.903 --> 00:21:53.093\nAnd now, as we pointed it\nto the correct IP address,\n\n396\n00:21:53.093 --> 00:21:56.470\nwe've also enabled NTP at the same time.\n\n397\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:01.360\nNow, if I show clock here, let's see.\n\n398\n00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.170\nAnd look at that, Zach.\n\n399\n00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:08.480\nSo right before, right,\nwe had done the NYCORE1.\n\n400\n00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.242\nWe did the show clock, and\nit was showing as 1993,\n\n401\n00:22:11.242 --> 00:22:12.320\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n402\n00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now that I've just run that same\n\n403\n00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.675\nexact command, It is now\n\n404\n00:22:19.675 --> 00:22:24.110\nactually happening, and it has a-\n&gt;&gt; But it has an asterisk, so\n\n405\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.780\nwhat is that telling us, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that right now, is telling\n\n406\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.740\nus that it is not it's own time server.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n407\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.180\n&gt;&gt; It's saying that, hey, I got this\n\n408\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.390\nauthoritatively from somewhere else.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n409\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.320\n&gt;&gt; So somebody else is giving me this\n\n410\n00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.905\nparticular information.\n&gt;&gt; That's what the asterisk means?\n\n411\n00:22:37.905 --> 00:22:39.187\nSo yeah, add this one, right,\n\n412\n00:22:39.187 --> 00:22:40.970\nbecause it can't be authoritative.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n413\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.177\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm saying I'm not\n\n414\n00:22:42.177 --> 00:22:43.620\nthe authority of my own time.\n\n415\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.400\nI'm getting it from someone else.\n\n416\n00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.390\nAnd so, it's going to do that as well.\n\n417\n00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:55.660\nSo now,\nif I type in show NTP associations,\n\n418\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.246\nwe can now see where it did connect to.\n\n419\n00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:06.260\nWell, the NTP server, and\nthe other one actually does\n\n420\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.880\neven tell us even this address, it is\nnow considered a system peer as well.\n\n421\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.220\nThe reference clock based off of it is\nactually the local clock, which is fine.\n\n422\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.940\nBut then, you start seeing there's the\nstratum, when it actually happened here,\n\n423\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.750\nhow often it's being polled, the reach.\n\n424\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:30.560\nThe delay right now is about 1.2 seconds,\nand offset, and the dispersion time.\n\n425\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.180\nYou name it, there's a lot of\ntechnical details back here for us.\n\n426\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.592\nBut our key in understanding whether or\nnot it's happened,\n\n427\n00:23:37.592 --> 00:23:40.330\nof course, right,\nis that when we ran that show clock,\n\n428\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.670\ndid we get the information that\nwe are expecting to see, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.710\nAnd if we did, that's good, and\nthen we can do the other one.\n\n430\n00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:53.010\nAll right, so now,\nlets do the show clock detail.\n\n431\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.420\nNow notice, this is different now, okay?\n\n432\n00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.175\nSo, when we took a look at the details,\nnotice that now,\n\n433\n00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:08.330\nit is actually going to say, look,\nit did find it now being authoritative.\n\n434\n00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.287\n&gt;&gt; Right [CROSSTALK].\n\n435\n00:24:09.287 --> 00:24:12.350\n&gt;&gt; Because the time source is NTP.\n\n436\n00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.540\nSo, I was, yeah.\n\n437\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:19.080\nSo, in this sense here, even though at\nthe beginning, it got it, the information.\n\n438\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.090\nIt still wasn't sure yet but\nnow when we ran it again,\n\n439\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.350\nafter just a few seconds later,\nit actually was able to match up and\n\n440\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.870\ngo nope, we believe that this is now\nthe authoritative time that we're getting,\n\n441\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.810\nand that we now have\nthe time source as NTP.\n\n442\n00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.210\nSo show clock detail will\nactually show us whether or\n\n443\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:40.340\nnot we're actually really using NTP or\nnot, along with all the information here.\n\n444\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.110\nSo these show commands\nare very valuable to us.\n\n445\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:48.150\nSo Zach, this allows us now to,\nonce we've had that master set up,\n\n446\n00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.970\nwe now can go to all the other\nrouters that we want to use, that\n\n447\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:00.390\nserver is being the master time clock,\nit really comes down to one command, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:04.450\nWhich is NTP server and\nthe IP address of that server.\n\n449\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:09.110\nOnce that's done, then those machines\nwill begin to establish that association,\n\n450\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.870\nthat synchronization and\nit will work and we can verify that.\n\n451\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.100\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I was gonna ask you.\n\n452\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.840\nAre we setting all the routers\nall at once at one time, or\n\n453\n00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.290\njust one router at a time?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n454\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.810\nright now we can only set one\nrouter at a time with this.\n\n455\n00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.310\nSo we still need to go ahead and\ndo that, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.880\nBut besides that though,\nI don't have to go in and\n\n457\n00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.670\nreset every single clock anymore.\n\n458\n00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.950\nI don't have to worry about\nchanging the timezone.\n\n459\n00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.410\nI don't have to worry about\nany of that other stuff here.\n\n460\n00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.560\nNow, I just point it to the one that we\ndid set up, and the one we did tell was\n\n461\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.480\nthe master, and once that's done,\nthen it is ready to go, okay?\n\n462\n00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.660\nSo that for us, actually does set up,\nand configure, verify NTP for us.\n\n463\n00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.840\nAnd you know,\n\n464\n00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.490\nyou'll be able to do that on your own now.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n465\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:52.880\nConfigure and verify NTP part two,\nmake sure you see part one.\n\n466\n00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.530\nRonnie, I know you want to say\nsomething else before we move on.\n\n467\n00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is again conceptually\n\n468\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:02.450\na little bit harder to remember, and it's\nbecause of just a couple of things here.\n\n469\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.624\nLet me see if I can zoom back, I have one\nmore that I wanted to show you too, okay?\n\n470\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.610\nThe hard thing is to remember here.\n\n471\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.040\nAnd I made this slide and then I\nremembered it right when we finished here.\n\n472\n00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.960\nThe NTP client is the one that has\nto command, which is weird, right?\n\n473\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.330\nNTP server on it.\n\n474\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.560\nIt doesn't seem like it, right,\n\n475\n00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.610\nbecause the NTP server is where we'd\nthink that we'd type in NTP server.\n\n476\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.690\nBut this is the one where\nwe type in ntp master.\n\n477\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.210\nThat's usually if anything, that is\nconfusing for people in a troubleshooting\n\n478\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.640\nissue, is that they don't remember\nwhich particular command goes where.\n\n479\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.630\nBut just remember the server,\nit only has ntp master on it.\n\n480\n00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:45.070\nAnd then every other client\nhas the word ntp server on it.\n\n481\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.730\nStrange but true.\n\n482\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.610\nIt's a little bit, at least in my mind,\nmentally kind of switched up.\n\n483\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.300\nBecause I can see why people\nwould get this confused.\n\n484\n00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.620\nBut that is the way that it is.\n\n485\n00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.620\nSo make sure you remember that\nas you go through it, okay?\n\n486\n00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.140\nNow the last thing that I also wanna say.\n\n487\n00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.310\nCan you set up the NTP master as a client?\n\n488\n00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.000\nYes.\n\n489\n00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.650\nYou can actually get this server to become\na client of one of these stratum devices\n\n490\n00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.150\nup here and have that all set up.\n\n491\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.590\nAnd then once you do that,\nthen it can also pass it out too.\n\n492\n00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.840\nBut we did it a little bit differently,\nwhere we set up the NTP master and\n\n493\n00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.670\nwe told it hey,\nyou're gonna report as stratum one,\n\n494\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.190\nwhich is fine, and\nit can also go out and do that as well.\n\n495\n00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:26.330\nBut that's for more advanced set\nthan what we're doing here today.\n\n496\n00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.930\nBut just remember these commands and\nwhere they'll also go,\n\n497\n00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.440\nand that will help you\nin the troubleshooting.\n\n498\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.625\nAnd don't forget, practice everyday in\nwhatever configurations you can do,\n\n499\n00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:37.205\nthat's gonna be very helpful\nto you as you get to the exam.\n\n500\n00:27:37.205 --> 00:27:38.505\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Ronnie, well done.\n\n501\n00:27:38.505 --> 00:27:43.155\nCisco's CCENT is a fabulous series,\nmake sure you watch every episode.\n\n502\n00:27:43.155 --> 00:27:45.025\nRonnie's worked very\nhard to put together for\n\n503\n00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:48.615\nyou all the information you're gonna\nneed that will help you go further.\n\n504\n00:27:48.615 -->

00:00:08.263\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:12.010\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.561\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.527\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:19.527 --> 00:00:24.346\nIn this particular episode, we're\ngonna configure standard access lists.\n\n8\n00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:25.690\nWhat is that all about?\n\n9\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.024\nWell, Ronnie Wong is here to tell us.\n\n10\n00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:28.470\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.061\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:32.613\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non our CCENT journey together, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:37.110\nWe are now at that part where we're taking\na look at really one of the next to last,\n\n14\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.700\nthe penultimate topic, which,\nof course, is infrastructure services.\n\n15\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.539\nAnd now we're getting to that\npoint of where we're talking\n\n16\n00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.427\nabout standard access control lists.\n\n17\n00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:48.340\nNow it's exactly like it sounds.\n\n18\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.321\nWhen we talk about this, an access\ncontrol list talks about, of course,\n\n19\n00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.841\nthen the idea of controlling access,\nright?\n\n20\n00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:59.375\nSo there's a part, and when you actually\njust think about the title of what we're\n\n21\n00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.317\ntalking about here, right,\nis that we're going to either restrict or\n\n22\n00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:06.420\nwe're going to deny\naccess into our network.\n\n23\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.320\nSo that's where we're actually starting\noff when we think about this, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.690\nSo in the idea of what we're talking\nabout, in a network, by itself,\n\n25\n00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.490\nwe've gotta realize that our network's\ngonna continue to grow and change.\n\n26\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.890\nAnd that means we need to control\naccess to certain parts of our network.\n\n27\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.607\nAn access control list is one of the\nprimary tools that we're going to use to\n\n28\n00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:26.264\nhelp us out.\n\n29\n00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:30.446\nSo let's take a look at my diagram here,\nand this will help us to at least\n\n30\n00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:34.210\nget a visualization of something\nthat we need to understand.\n\n31\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.729\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I don't wanna say it's the most\n\n32\n00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.262\ntypical example of a secured network, but\nit's a good example of a secured network.\n\n33\n00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:44.059\nAnd this diagram helps us out,\n\n34\n00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:47.931\nbecause we're gonna see a couple\nof things in this diagram here too\n\n35\n00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:52.580\nthat you may also encounter in the future\nas you get ready for the exam.\n\n36\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.040\nPay attention to, of course,\nthe symbols that are actually used, right?\n\n37\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.242\nSo notice the symbol on the router, and\nthis one is the symbol for firewall.\n\n38\n00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:03.557\nI tried to make it a different color\nthan what the actual outline would be so\n\n39\n00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:07.120\nthat we could see it a little bit better,\nand even the switch.\n\n40\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.740\nAll those are components that make up\nthe infrastructure of our network.\n\n41\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.700\nAnd when we start to take a look\nat the idea of the infrastructure,\n\n42\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.670\nof the network and we're security minded\nabout it, this actually does provide,\n\n43\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.270\nwell, some different layers of security.\n\n44\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.730\nThe idea of having a single entry\npoint as far as from the Internet,\n\n45\n00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.550\ninto our network,\nwe may have a perimeter type of router\n\n46\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.020\nthat we can also just limit\naccess if we choose to.\n\n47\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.590\nSo we're not troubleshooting\nmany different connections.\n\n48\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.380\nWe're actually just troubleshooting one\nconnection going out and coming in.\n\n49\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.049\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In our firewall, well, this allows us\n\n50\n00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.718\nseparation from with inside of our network\nas well by using a hardware device.\n\n51\n00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:52.080\nAnd like the firewall says, it really\ndoes initially, at least, by default.\n\n52\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.800\nIt prevents all access that wants\nto get inside of our network\n\n53\n00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.520\nto not actually be allowed.\n\n54\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.980\nAnd then you and I open up what\nwe want to allow to come in.\n\n55\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.877\nSo in this firewall here,\n\n56\n00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:08.374\nyou're gonna hear terms like\nthe idea of untrusted network.\n\n57\n00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:11.971\nAnd you're gonna hear terms like trusted\nnetwork, and that's what a firewall does.\n\n58\n00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:17.215\nIt actually helps us to define boundaries\nnot in terms of a perimeter boundaries so\n\n59\n00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:20.570\nmuch, between the Internet and my network.\n\n60\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.920\nBut security boundaries, such as what\nis considered untrusted versus trusted.\n\n61\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.480\nSo, for example,\nfrom the perimeter router and\n\n62\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.642\nthe Internet all the way to this interface\nright here on the firewall itself.\n\n63\n00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:37.880\nWell, that is gonna be considered,\nlet's say, our untrusted side.\n\n64\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.478\nSo we don't have much control over here.\n\n65\n00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:42.727\nWe have some,\nbecause we have this perimeter firewall,\n\n66\n00:03:42.727 --> 00:03:44.970\nbut we don't have a lot of that.\n\n67\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.285\nBut then at this firewall,\nwe can actually automatically,\n\n68\n00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:53.310\nby just plugging in this device,\nthe untrusted port that we're configuring,\n\n69\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.940\nwe can go ahead and say, look,\nall data that's coming in by default,\n\n70\n00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.100\nokay, in other words, originating from\noutside, it's gonna be blocked here.\n\n71\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.430\nThen, from that point, on the firewall,\nand the way that we can do it,\n\n72\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.650\nwe can route it either to\nan internal trusted network.\n\n73\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.460\nOr we may even route it\nout to other places,\n\n74\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.840\nlike a DMZ, which stands for\ndemilitarized zone.\n\n75\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.982\nAnd this allows us to be able to put out\ninto the world things like web search,\n\n76\n00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:23.440\nwhere everybody on the Internet\ncan get access to it.\n\n77\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.100\nAnd also,\n\n78\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.030\neven internally we can get access to\nour own web servers if we need to.\n\n79\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.244\nBut even if this is compromised,\nour internal network is not.\n\n80\n00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:33.530\nThe same thing with email.\n\n81\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.020\nWe may also put our email servers\nout here in this DMZ as well.\n\n82\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.512\nBecause what we want to do is we\nwant people that are traveling for\n\n83\n00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:45.404\nour company or working remotely for\nour company to get access to email.\n\n84\n00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:50.334\nBut we don't want them having to go all\nthe way through internally where they're\n\n85\n00:04:50.334 --> 00:04:53.780\ngonna be exposed inside,\nand then get access in.\n\n86\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.156\nWe may put that in here, too.\n\n87\n00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:55.818\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n88\n00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:59.527\n&gt;&gt; So a firewall can help us to route,\nonce again, either to a DMZ, or\n\n89\n00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:03.100\nmaybe even inside of the internal network,\nitself.\n\n90\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.309\nFrom there, we have an internal router.\n\n91\n00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.403\nAn internal router can actually be\nused in a couple of different ways.\n\n92\n00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:11.641\nHere I've got it to set\nto two different VLANs.\n\n93\n00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:15.678\nAnd we're actually using this router on a\nstick configuration just as an example in\n\n94\n00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:20.880\nour diagram, right, where it actually\nseparates out between VLAN10 and VLAN20.\n\n95\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.810\nRemember that they won't be able to\ncommunicate with each other, and\n\n96\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.970\nVLANs are perfectly fine with that.\n\n97\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.010\nBut now we're adding in another\ndevice that helps us, again,\n\n98\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.910\nto set control in between\nthose boundaries as well.\n\n99\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.790\nSo all of those are different\nparts of configurations.\n\n100\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.271\nAnd when we start talking about the idea\nof implementing access control lists,\n\n101\n00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:42.700\nwell, we can do it on different devices.\n\n102\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.210\nYou'll see them on firewalls,\nyou'll see them on routers,\n\n103\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.620\nyou'll even see them in switches, too,\nokay, when you start configuring them.\n\n104\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.460\nBecause it depends on where your\nneed actually is going to be\n\n105\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.780\nwhen we start talking about\nthe idea of access control.\n\n106\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.840\nSo that is what we are starting off\nwith when we start doing that, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.585\nSo not only do we have it as far as basic\nsecurity, like what we had talked about\n\n108\n00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:11.914\nhere, right, which is controlling access,\neither denying the data from coming in or\n\n109\n00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:15.350\nwe can permit data as well but\nwe want to restrict it.\n\n110\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.512\nAnd we can do so in many different ways.\n\n111\n00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:20.897\nAccess control, this is kinda\nthe initial tool that you and\n\n112\n00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:23.275\nI have to worry about when we do so, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:28.420\nThe primary one that the C-C-E-N-T,\nor the CCENT exam is gonna focus\n\n114\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.270\nin on is gonna be what we call\nStandard Access Control Lists, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.000\nAnd then standard access control lists,\nit's a little bit different than there's\n\n116\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.731\nactually gotta be if there's a standard\none, there's gotta be another one, not so\n\n117\n00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.960\nstandard one, but\nthey don't say that, right?\n\n118\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.550\nThey call it an extended\naccess control list, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.660\nSo we'll talk about\nthe differences between those and\n\n120\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.420\nwe'll show you those too inside of\nour lab as we get to it, too, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.434\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n122\n00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:57.810\nAnd then we'll also talk about what we\ncall named access control lists and\n\n123\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.998\nshow you the difference\nin the configuration.\n\n124\n00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:03.513\nBut it begins with us actually just\nunderstanding that as we start off\n\n125\n00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:04.790\nhere, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.930\nSo when we start off, okay,\nhere's our basic topology that you and\n\n127\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.130\nI are gonna be working\nwith up here at the top.\n\n128\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.270\nWe have a single router,\nwhich is gonna be NYEDGE1.\n\n129\n00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.420\nWe have a lab machine, okay,\nwhich is gonna be 192.168.16.10.\n\n130\n00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.176\nAnd you and I are gonna be able to\ngain access into a practicelab.com\n\n131\n00:07:26.176 --> 00:07:29.190\nweb server out there somewhere.\n\n132\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.420\nWell, when I wanna configure\nan access control list here,\n\n133\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.460\nokay, in terms of a standard one, well,\nlet's first talk about this idea of what\n\n134\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.930\nstandard actually means when we start\nto do something like this, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.030\nA standard access control\nlist is only concerned\n\n136\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.280\nwith the source IP that's going out, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.769\nIt doesn't care anything about\nwhat the destination is.\n\n138\n00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:55.915\nWhat we're saying is,\nI'm filtering based on the source,\n\n139\n00:07:55.915 --> 00:08:00.791\non who is connecting to that router and\nwhat it is that I'm looking for So\n\n140\n00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:06.930\nin that sense, it actually allows me to\nrestrict who is sending the traffic, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.920\nAnd I can either say I want this\nparticular traffic to be allowed, or\n\n142\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.030\nI don't want this traffic to be allowed.\n\n143\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.370\nAnd I can actually configure\nthe router to do that as well.\n\n144\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.900\nSo that's a big part of what we\ncan actually be able to do here.\n\n145\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.950\nThe other part of what an access\ncontrol list can also be used for\n\n146\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.540\nis that it has to at least begin\n\n147\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.310\nwith identifying that traffic when\nit gets into the router as well.\n\n148\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.070\nSo we can create an access control\nlist that then later on we can use for\n\n149\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.980\nother additional services.\n\n150\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.020\nThe primary one that I'm thinking\nabout running now in my mind\n\n151\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.750\nis one that's called\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n152\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.445\nSo that we can use that and instead of\nhaving typed in that entire address,\n\n153\n00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:52.960\nI'm essentially creating that and just\ngonna refer to the access list as an alias\n\n154\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.798\nwhen we configure\nNetwork Access Control as well.\n\n155\n00:08:55.798 --> 00:08:59.850\nSo I type out the configuration\nin two generic ways for us, so\n\n156\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.280\nthat we could see this.\n\n157\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.440\nOf course,\nwhen we configure access control list,\n\n158\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.760\nthere's gonna be a couple things\nthat we'll have to do, and\n\n159\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.140\nwe're gonna do this of course in the same\nway that our lab is set up to help us out.\n\n160\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.850\nBut just so that we can see this and\nthat you'll have them in your notes,\n\n161\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.690\ncuz you will have a copy of these too,\ndon't forget,\n\n162\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.610\nyou'll start off in\nthe Global Configuration mode.\n\n163\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.530\nAnd it's easy to create\nan access control list, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.980\nA standard access control list,\naccess-list here, and\n\n165\n00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.592\nthen you have a number.\n\n166\n00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:32.070\nThe number's gonna be between 1 and\n99, okay, 1 and 99.\n\n167\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:37.442\nAnd then you actually have another one\nthat's actually out there, which we'll\n\n168\n00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:43.382\ntalk about a little bit later, that\nactually begins at 1,300 through 1,399.\n\n169\n00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:46.070\nAnd that's because they\nkinda realized something.\n\n170\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.590\nThey said, look,\nthere's gonna come a point here\n\n171\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.100\nwhen you're gonna need more\nthan 100 access control lists.\n\n172\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.945\nAnd you're probably like, are you joking?\n\n173\n00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:54.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n174\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.890\nthey probably thought that\nat the very beginning but\n\n175\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.630\nthen they realized something\nwhen they limited that.\n\n176\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.870\nWell, then it actually did\nget bigger than they thought.\n\n177\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.710\nAnd you might be wondering, so\nwhy did they go 1 through 99?\n\n178\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.351\nWell, beginning with 200 or\nso, yeah, I'm trying to think.\n\n179\n00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:13.487\nYeah, beginning with 200, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.485\nThen all the way up to 1,300 or 1,299,\n\n181\n00:10:17.485 --> 00:10:23.936\nat that point there were different\nprotocols that were used to transmit data.\n\n182\n00:10:23.936 --> 00:10:28.990\nThe IPSX PX, NSA, AppleTalk,\nall these other protocols.\n\n183\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.171\nThey all got divided their particular\nslice of those numbers, so\n\n184\n00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:37.213\nthat they could have about 100\naccess controllers as well.\n\n185\n00:10:37.213 --> 00:10:41.180\nWell, with TCP/IP, we got configure\nright here between 1 and 99.\n\n186\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.820\nSo that's what we're using today.\n\n187\n00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.610\nSo that's what we're actually seeing here.\n\n188\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.870\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, do you pick this number or\nis it chosen for you?\n\n189\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, you actually get to pick\nwhatever number that you want to.\n\n190\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.190\nThe hard part is remembering to\nremember what that number is.\n\n191\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because that's the identifier for\n\n192\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.290\nthis access control list, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.520\nSo here, I just picked number\none as an example here.\n\n194\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.278\nSo you pick a number between 1 and 99.\n\n195\n00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:08.066\nAnd that automatically tells the router\nthe only thing I'm looking at is\n\n196\n00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:10.110\nthe source IP address, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.690\nSo then, the next thing that you have to\ndo is you need to actually either permit\n\n198\n00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.848\nor deny the traffic.\n\n199\n00:11:15.848 --> 00:11:18.772\nSo is it something you're\nallowing to go through or\n\n200\n00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:22.041\nare you denying that source\nfrom going through, right?\n\n201\n00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:25.200\nBut that's the next syntax that you have.\n\n202\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.110\nAnd then of course your source IP address.\n\n203\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.450\nNow the source IP address can be a single\ncomputer if we want it to, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:37.220\nUsually it has one IP address, right,\nor it could be an entire network, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.590\nSo you can actually do either one.\n\n206\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.550\nNow the hard part for you and me,\nthis is something we haven't come to yet,\n\n207\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.980\nwhich we'll need to discuss briefly,\nis what we call a wildcard mask.\n\n208\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.789\nNow we've talked about what\na subnet mask is, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:52.789 --> 00:11:57.446\nA subnet mask helps us to separate\nout which part is the network ID,\n\n210\n00:11:57.446 --> 00:12:00.023\nokay, and which part is the node ID,\n\n211\n00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:05.200\nwhich part individually identifies\nthat computer within that network.\n\n212\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.550\nSo that subnet mask helps us to do that.\n\n213\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.260\nA wildcard mask is all\nabout matching bits, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.964\nSo it's all about that idea.\n\n215\n00:12:14.964 --> 00:12:19.802\nAnd what that means instead of\nusing ones to help us to identify\n\n216\n00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:24.734\nwhat bits end up matching,\nwhat we do is we instead use zeroes to\n\n217\n00:12:24.734 --> 00:12:29.040\ntell us what bits end up matching instead,\nokay?\n\n218\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.025\nSo we essentially, a lot of people you'll\nhear it called an inverse subnet mask.\n\n219\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.790\nYou'll see it written that\nway a lot of times, but\n\n220\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.440\nit doesn't have to follow\nthe same rules as a subnet mask.\n\n221\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.140\nFor example, a subnet mask normally,\nthere'd have to be that continuous\n\n222\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.350\nstring of ones from the left-hand side,\nthe most significant bit,\n\n223\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.640\ntoward the right-hand side,\nthe least significant bit.\n\n224\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.091\nAnd wherever that last bit\nis on the right-hand side,\n\n225\n00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:56.916\nthat's gonna be your network portion.\n\n226\n00:12:56.916 --> 00:12:59.877\nSo out of 32 bits,\nif you choose 24 of them for\n\n227\n00:12:59.877 --> 00:13:04.286\nyour network ID in terms of subnet mask,\nthat means the first 24 bits or\n\n228\n00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:07.162\nthe first 3 octets\nare gonna be your network.\n\n229\n00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:10.800\nIn a wildcard mask,\nyou don't have to do that at all.\n\n230\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.650\nYou just have to choose which ones\nare gonna represent zeros and\n\n231\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.033\nwhich ones are gonna represent\nones if you chose to.\n\n232\n00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:20.930\nNow that's a little bit more confusing as\nwe get into CCNA routing and switching.\n\n233\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.630\nWe'll see where we would choose to use\na wildcard mask instead, especially when\n\n234\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.670\nwe're doing this, to help us to filter out\ndifferent things and to help us to make\n\n235\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.190\nsure that we understand that it's\nnot the same as inverse subnet mask.\n\n236\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.482\nSo even if you read it some place on the\nInternet, and it's like, they just call it\n\n237\n00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:39.372\ninverse subnet mask, that's because\nit's how it's commonly used.\n\n238\n00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:41.280\nBut we'll show you in CCNA routing and\n\n239\n00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.500\nswitching that you don't have\nto follow the same rules.\n\n240\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.060\nSo we'll actually show\nyou an example here too.\n\n241\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.135\nSo notice I actually did that.\n\n242\n00:13:48.135 --> 00:13:52.130\nI showed you the example\nright here underneath it.\n\n243\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.392\nSo here I've chosen access-list\n1 deny 192.168.16.10.\n\n244\n00:13:56.392 --> 00:14:02.176\nAnd now you can see what the wildcard\nmask ends up looking like,\n\n245\n00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:05.360\nokay, which is 0.0.0.\n\n246\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:12.370\nAnd that means the first three octets have\nto match, so 192.168.16 has to match.\n\n247\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.220\nBut notice on this one, this 255 here,\n\n248\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:20.030\nwhat you would actually convert 16 here\ninto the ones that you would need to,\n\n249\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.170\nand then you would actually\nbe able to do that.\n\n250\n00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.900\nBut I just chose to say essentially\nthis is exactly how it shows up, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.610\nSo that's fine for what we want to,\nor the ten here, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.379\nNow you can also write this a different\nway if you wanted to make sure\n\n253\n00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:34.774\nit was only that one host, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:38.723\nYou wanna make sure there is only that\none host and not the entire subnet,\n\n255\n00:14:38.723 --> 00:14:41.030\nwhich is what I've done right here.\n\n256\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:46.001\nIs that you could do access\nlist here 1 deny and\n\n257\n00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:50.844\nhost as an alias for\na 32 bit wildcard mask,\n\n258\n00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:57.988\na 0.0.0.0 saying that, sure,\neverything matches here.\n\n259\n00:14:57.988 --> 00:15:01.510\n192.168.16.10 match all 32 bits instead.\n\n260\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.508\nSo you can do it either\nway as you do that.\n\n261\n00:15:04.508 --> 00:15:09.339\nThe only other thing you have to add\nin at the end here, is access-list 1,\n\n262\n00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:10.755\nand then permit any.\n\n263\n00:15:10.755 --> 00:15:18.088\nAny is also another way to be an alias for\nany other address.\n\n264\n00:15:18.088 --> 00:15:22.838\nThe reason why we need that is\nthat without this permit any,\n\n265\n00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:27.400\nthere's automatically\nan implicit deny statement that\n\n266\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.280\nsays deny any instead at the end\nof this access list one.\n\n267\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.420\nSo you and I don't see it,\nbut it's default-ly there.\n\n268\n00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.884\nSo that means that if it doesn't match\nthe first entry that I put in there,\n\n269\n00:15:39.884 --> 00:15:42.911\nthen the last entry that\nit will match is deny any.\n\n270\n00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:45.270\nAnd that means it will\ndeny everything else too.\n\n271\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.928\nThe second part of an access\nlist of course is to make\n\n272\n00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:51.747\nsure that you put it on to an interface.\n\n273\n00:15:51.747 --> 00:15:54.956\nSo you have to choose\nthe proper interface and\n\n274\n00:15:54.956 --> 00:15:58.340\nthen you have to decide\nIP access-group here.\n\n275\n00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.878\nYou put the number, and\nI don't know why I chose 10 but\n\n276\n00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:02.724\nlet me do this a little bit differently.\n\n277\n00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:05.111\nLet me do a 1, access-group 1, and\n\n278\n00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:10.310\nthen you choose whether it's actually\ninbound or outbound as well, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.540\nSo those are some of the choices that\nwe'll have to end up making here, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.570\nNow when we start taking a look at that,\nright, there's a lot of choices that\n\n281\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.140\nwe have to make, and that's why\nwe're gonna walk you through this.\n\n282\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.050\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Because it is a bit confusing.\n\n283\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.500\nBut essentially there's two steps to this,\nright?\n\n284\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.079\nThe access list we have to configure, but\nonce it's configured, it just sits there.\n\n285\n00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:33.950\nThe second part of it is to\napply it to an interface.\n\n286\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.740\nNow you'll actually see a syntax change.\n\n287\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.724\nSo before we create an access list, but\nwhen we want to apply it to an interface,\n\n288\n00:16:41.724 --> 00:16:50.960\nthe syntax changes instead ip access-group\nand then we refer to the list number.\n\n289\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.900\nNotice that this is access list 1,\nwe're saying ip access, and\n\n290\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.820\nthen we're saying, group together what?\n\n291\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.621\nThe interface and\nthis 1 in the list here, and\n\n292\n00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:05.725\nthen we're actually\nchoosing inbound instead.\n\n293\n00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:10.305\nWe're saying as it comes into this\ninterface, we're going to go ahead and\n\n294\n00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:12.260\nblock it at that point.\n\n295\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.839\nSo outbound means that when it\nleaves the interface instead, and\n\n296\n00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.430\nyou may choose outbound sometimes.\n\n297\n00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.316\nBut I don't know at this point what\nis actually a good instance that in\n\n298\n00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:27.957\nwhat we're learning about that would\nactually show the idea of outbound, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:27.957 --> 00:17:30.430\nOkay, so let's just make\nsure that we understand and\n\n300\n00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.915\nwe'll kind of explain this again\nonce we get into the configuration.\n\n301\n00:17:33.915 --> 00:17:36.965\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\ndo that right now as\n\n302\n00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:41.020\nwe get started here to make sure\nwe understand what's happening.\n\n303\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.949\nSo I'm gonna switch on over to my lab\nif I can actually find it, there we go.\n\n304\n00:17:44.949 --> 00:17:48.900\nAnd let me change this up for a moment so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n305\n00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.720\nSo we'll start here with NYEDGE1 and\nI will zoom in to help us out.\n\n306\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.750\nLet me close out a few tabs and\nthat way we'll be able to do this,\n\n307\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.500\nthere we go, okay.\n\n308\n00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.271\nSo now that I'm actually right here,\nwe're ready to get started,\n\n309\n00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.669\nwhere we are going to essentially\ncreate a numbered access list,\n\n310\n00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:15.360\nit's gonna be a standard access list for\nus.\n\n311\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.390\nSo let's go ahead and\njust do this for right now, okay?\n\n312\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:25.000\nSo we'll get into our global\nconfiguration mode And\n\n313\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.961\nonce I'm in the global configuration mode\nhere, this is where we're gonna spend just\n\n314\n00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:32.234\na little bit of time and taking a look\nat what we're typing here, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:36.491\nSo we are going to permit\nthe entire network,\n\n316\n00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:45.130\n192.168.16 network is what we're\nactually going to be permitting here.\n\n317\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.340\nSo the way that I would do that\nis I type in access-list and\n\n318\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.115\nwe'll just use the number 1 right now.\n\n319\n00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.300\n&gt;&gt; And then from that point, let's go\nahead and so some question marks so\n\n321\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.810\nthat we can take a look.\n\n322\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:02.110\nNotice I have the ability to permit or\ndeny or even add in a comment.\n\n323\n00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.271\nNow in a production network we're adding\nin comments is really good because if not,\n\n324\n00:19:05.271 --> 00:19:06.918\nyou're gonna see all\nthese access lists and\n\n325\n00:19:06.918 --> 00:19:08.536\nyou're not gonna know what they're for.\n\n326\n00:19:08.536 --> 00:19:11.445\nSo adding in a remark is\nactually a good thing but for\n\n327\n00:19:11.445 --> 00:19:15.480\nright now we're just gonna\ndo access-list 1 permit.\n\n328\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.856\nSo now I have to type it in again,\naccess-list 1 permit.\n\n329\n00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:21.630\nAll right, so\n\n330\n00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.535\nnow notice that I have to actually be\nable to put after this permit here.\n\n331\n00:19:25.535 --> 00:19:27.754\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Either to the host name or\n\n332\n00:19:27.754 --> 00:19:33.330\nthe IP address, and it even gives\nme of course the aliases, right?\n\n333\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.830\nAny means, any single source.\n\n334\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.074\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then of course\n\n335\n00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.940\nhost is actually a single\nIP address as well.\n\n336\n00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:46.929\nSo instead what we are going to do\nof course is access-list 1 permit.\n\n337\n00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:51.511\nAnd this time we're going to type\nin the entire network address,\n\n338\n00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:55.024\nwhich is going to be 192.168.16.0.\n\n339\n00:19:55.024 --> 00:19:57.617\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And this time I wanna make sure that I\n\n340\n00:19:57.617 --> 00:20:01.950\nmatch the 192, which is going to be 0 168,\nwhich is gonna be a 0.\n\n341\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:07.240\nAnd then .16, and now I don't care\nwhat's actually in the last octet,\n\n342\n00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.410\nwhich means the entire network.\n\n343\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:14.880\nNow there's one more time I'm going\nto press the question mark here and\n\n344\n00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.675\nshow you that there's also\na log that you can see, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So on NY edge,\n\n346\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.840\nnotice it actually gives\nme this logging here.\n\n347\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.480\nNow the reason why logging is\nimportant is if I am doing let's say,\n\n348\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.340\ninitially especially testing here, okay?\n\n349\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.920\nI want to log at the beginning whether or\nnot this access list is effective.\n\n350\n00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.642\nIf it's effective, there'll be matches\nthat will show up when we actually do\n\n351\n00:20:39.642 --> 00:20:41.590\nrun a show access list command.\n\n352\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.100\nAnd then I want to make\nsure that it's logged.\n\n353\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.880\nYou do have to be careful because if\nyou do this and you select log here,\n\n354\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.580\nit will send it to the place where it\nnormally sends it, which is the buffer.\n\n355\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.750\nWhich is a small area\nmemory on that device, and\n\n356\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.960\nthat buffer of course can get filled up.\n\n357\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.280\nAnd that means the earliest logs of\ncourse will end up disappearing, and\n\n358\n00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.770\nthen whatever the logs that\nare there aren't there.\n\n359\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:09.890\nSo usually for us it's not so much that we\nmind about the earliest stuff being gone.\n\n360\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.220\nBut the problem that we have is if we're\ntrying to save it for historical data,\n\n361\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.670\nthere's no real use for it, but\nthis way you can at least tell.\n\n362\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.490\nNow you may see on certain other devices,\nas you do this,\n\n363\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.445\nyou may see also an issue here for\nsmart log.\n\n364\n00:21:24.445 --> 00:21:28.995\nIf you're using smart log it's because\nthere's another technology that you're\n\n365\n00:21:28.995 --> 00:21:32.840\nalso running on your network as well,\ncalled Cisco NetFlow.\n\n366\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.634\nSo if you're running NetFlow that actually\nis a condition in which you instead choose\n\n367\n00:21:36.634 --> 00:21:39.260\nto send that to a smart log instead.\n\n368\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.732\nBut on mine, on NYEDGE1 here,\nit only allows me to do that one.\n\n369\n00:21:43.732 --> 00:21:46.410\nLet me me copy this thing over here.\n\n370\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.120\nAnd we're not gonna worry about logging,\nam I?\n\n371\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.025\nNope, at this point,\nwe're not gonna worry about logging, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:53.025 --> 00:21:57.865\nSo once we have that set up at this\npoint here, let's go ahead and\n\n373\n00:21:57.865 --> 00:22:03.455\ntype in a do show access-list here.\n\n374\n00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:06.725\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nshow you something, okay?\n\n375\n00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:10.490\nHere is a verification that you've\nset up the access control list.\n\n376\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.880\nNotice now, under Standard IP access list,\nthere's the 1.\n\n377\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.100\nAnd we've just configured this one, and\nit begins by giving us an entry number.\n\n378\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.820\nSo you have an access control lesson, ACL.\n\n379\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.300\nAnd then each one of these that you\nsee that also has a number besides it,\n\n380\n00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.310\nthat's called an ACE, or\nan access control entry.\n\n381\n00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.581\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's not that it's so much that,\n\n382\n00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:37.280\ntechnically that's\nthe correct way to do it.\n\n383\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.127\nAnd you probably won't get something\nlike that on the exam like,\"what's\n\n384\n00:22:40.127 --> 00:22:41.337\nthe difference between these?\n\n385\n00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:45.680\nBut remember that the greater,\nthe more encapsulating unit, right?\n\n386\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.350\nIs that you and I just set up this\naccess control right here, okay?\n\n387\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.990\nAnd then it begins with this, and\n\n388\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:56.046\nso each access control list, there can\nbe multiple entries that we have, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:56.046 --> 00:22:57.990\nAnd here it's saying\nwhat we're gonna do is,\n\n390\n00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.430\nwe're gonna take the one\nthat you just typed in.\n\n391\n00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:04.370\nWe're gonna assign a number of 10\nto this entry to permit this,and\n\n392\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.340\nhere is the wildcard bits.\n\n393\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.300\nAnd you may be wondering why 10,\nwhy not actually assign it as 1?\n\n394\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.704\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well 1 is the lowest number\n\n395\n00:23:11.704 --> 00:23:12.930\nthat we can have.\n\n396\n00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.170\nBut Zach, what if I actually\ninstead said I look at this now.\n\n397\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.630\nI don't need to change this access control\nlist because it's there, but I need to\n\n398\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.260\nadd something else in here and I believe\nit should go right before this one.\n\n399\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.670\nWell now I have the ability then,\nto go back in and change this.\n\n400\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.507\nAnd I can do that by adding in a 9 or\nan 8 or 7, 6 all the way down to a 1, so\n\n401\n00:23:34.507 --> 00:23:36.396\nthat gives me that ability.\n\n402\n00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:39.239\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And if we don't specify what that entry\n\n403\n00:23:39.239 --> 00:23:42.699\nnumber is,\nthe next one will be a 20 and then 30.\n\n404\n00:23:42.699 --> 00:23:45.180\nAnd then that way we can\nput things in between,\n\n405\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.116\nas we realize we gotta insert\nit somewhere in between.\n\n406\n00:23:48.116 --> 00:23:51.947\nSo it actually puts spaces in there for\nus or holding places.\n\n407\n00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:54.862\nThat we can now add in\nsome entries in between.\n\n408\n00:23:54.862 --> 00:23:58.905\nSo that's what you end up seeing in\nterms of that number as well, all right?\n\n409\n00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:00.170\nBut we're gonna leave this one alone.\n\n410\n00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.210\nAnd you can also see where\nthat access control list or\n\n411\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.380\nanother one that's out there, okay?\n\n412\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.870\nOne that they've named instead,\nStandard IP list, called NAT.\n\n413\n00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.710\nNotice this is no longer a number.\n\n414\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.590\nThis is what's called\na named access control list.\n\n415\n00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.520\nAnd this one has about the same\nthing that what we did.\n\n416\n00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.440\nAnd this is the way that they identify\nthe traffic that will end up running\n\n417\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.218\nthrough network address translation to get\ntranslated out to the Internet as well.\n\n418\n00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:31.090\nSo here is an example, and\nthey've already to set this up for you.\n\n419\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.384\nThat's why you're seeing that entry\nright in there for right now, okay?\n\n420\n00:24:34.384 --> 00:24:36.340\nAll right, so\nlet's create another one here.\n\n421\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.610\nAnd this time,\nwe're gonna do a deny as well, okay?\n\n422\n00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.312\nBut we're gonna create\nan access control list 10.\n\n423\n00:24:43.312 --> 00:24:50.480\nSo it's gonna be access-list 10,\nand this time we're gonna deny.\n\n424\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.570\nNow I'm only gonna deny one address,\nwhich is gonna be 192.168.16.10.\n\n425\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.607\nSo I have two ways where I can do that.\n\n426\n00:24:57.607 --> 00:25:02.405\nIf I want the entire thing,\nI can do 192.168.16.10 and\n\n427\n00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:07.080\nthen for the entirety of the address,\nit would be right here.\n\n428\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.230\nNotice all four are 0s,\nsaying match every single bit.\n\n429\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But the equivalent of that,\n\n430\n00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.930\nif I do not want to type it out and\n\n431\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:20.270\nprobably the more standard practices of\nthis is instead gonna be using an alias.\n\n432\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:25.146\nJust say, hey, I wanna deny this host,\n192.168.16.10, and\n\n433\n00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:27.475\nwhy would I choose to do that, Zach?\n\n434\n00:25:27.475 --> 00:25:31.502\nThe reason why I would choose to do it,\nis if I can't remember, the 0s,\n\n435\n00:25:31.502 --> 00:25:35.180\ndo I need to do the first three 0s and\nthen 255, or whatever?\n\n436\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.720\nIf I know that it's only\nsupposed to be one IP address,\n\n437\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.520\nI do host instead right here as an alias.\n\n438\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.190\nAnd that automatically sets\nthe wildcard bits to all 32 bits\n\n439\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.530\nas being the wildcard bit itself, okay?\n\n440\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.660\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we'll go ahead and\n\n441\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.775\nadd that one in there, and then let's\ntake a look at the access list now.\n\n442\n00:25:54.775 --> 00:26:00.660\nShow access-lists.\n\n443\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.390\nAnd now you can see where there's two\ndifferent access lists listed, okay,\n\n444\n00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.320\nthat we have just configured.\n\n445\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.770\nNotice that one is,\n\n446\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.700\nof course, access list one,\nwhich we permitted the entire ten network.\n\n447\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:23.830\nBut notice this one right here were we\nhave now denied one IP address instead.\n\n448\n00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.990\nSo when you start taking a look\nat this access control list and\n\n449\n00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.760\nyou start seeing it, now we have to\ntalk about the processing order.\n\n450\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:36.480\nSo as traffic now is coming to the router,\nthe way that these are processed,\n\n451\n00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.325\nbecause they're not exactly\nin line with each other.\n\n452\n00:26:39.325 --> 00:26:41.510\nOne's not an entry of the other one here,\nright?\n\n453\n00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.180\nWe have access list 1,\nwe have access list 10.\n\n454\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.260\nWell, which one gets processed first,\nokay?\n\n455\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.880\nAnd that's kinda the key here.\n\n456\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.560\nThe key in what gets processed first is\nthe way that it appears in this list.\n\n457\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.580\nSo in this list as well,\nokay, as you see it,\n\n458\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.700\naccess list 1 will get processed first.\n\n459\n00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.030\nSo now anything coming in with\n192.168 16.16, 16.17, 16.18,\n\n460\n00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:09.130\nthat will get processed first,\nand will hit this\n\n461\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:14.990\naccess control list, and be permitted to\ngo through, or leave, or whatever, okay?\n\n462\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.587\nThen, if it actually happens to,\nlet's say it doesn't match 10.\n\n463\n00:27:18.587 --> 00:27:21.292\nLet's say it's actually from 16.10.\n\n464\n00:27:21.292 --> 00:27:25.851\nWell, now as it hits the router, it we'll\ntake a look at this, and it'll go, hey,\n\n465\n00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:29.060\nit matches this, so\nthere's a problem already.\n\n466\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.760\nIt will automatically process it as this,\nokay?\n\n467\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.590\nWell, if that happens,\n\n468\n00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:40.439\nit will never hit the second item because\nit only processes what it has to match.\n\n469\n00:27:40.439 --> 00:27:45.784\nWell, 192.168.16.10,\nit is essentially at this point\n\n470\n00:27:45.784 --> 00:27:52.530\na subset of what this entirety that we've\nactually put here, the entire network.\n\n471\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.460\nSo if it matches this,\nit doesn't ever process the second one.\n\n472\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.620\nSo at some point, what would be better\nis if this came before this, okay?\n\n473\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.950\nSo how do we actually ensure that?\n\n474\n00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.520\nThe best practice in training\naccess control list as we do this.\n\n475\n00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.070\nEven within a single access control list\nand the entries that we put in there\n\n476\n00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.060\nis that the most specific items\nthat we can actually list here.\n\n477\n00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:23.370\nSuch as denying a single IP address\nversus a range of IP addresses,\n\n478\n00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.540\nwhat we would do is we'd put\nthe one that actually says,\n\n479\n00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.820\nlet me deny the most specific one,\nwhich is gonna be the host instead.\n\n480\n00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.690\nSo deny that one first and\nthen allow the other one.\n\n481\n00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.405\nSo this, in this order, list number 10\nshould actually appear before list number\n\n482\n00:28:37.405 --> 00:28:40.620\n1, and that's the way that it\nwould actually be processed here.\n\n483\n00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.609\nSo there is a bit of different things\nthat can actually happen when you do\n\n484\n00:28:44.609 --> 00:28:46.682\nsomething like this as well, okay?\n\n485\n00:28:46.682 --> 00:28:51.482\nNow the other thing that we also have to\nbe able to do here is remember what I\n\n486\n00:28:51.482 --> 00:28:56.044\nsaid, that at the end of each of these,\neven though we don't see it,\n\n487\n00:28:56.044 --> 00:28:59.608\nthere is what's called\nan implicit deny statement.\n\n488\n00:28:59.608 --> 00:29:06.333\nSo even though this says 10 and it permits\n192.168.16.0, at the very end of this,\n\n489\n00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:11.581\nwhenever we finish whatever other things\nthat we add in in terms of entries,\n\n490\n00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:17.670\nright, after this, you'll actually\nsee that there's gonna be deny all.\n\n491\n00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:21.150\nSo if you understand that, that's fine,\n\n492\n00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.310\nas long as there's a permit statement\nin there somewhere, it will work.\n\n493\n00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:29.750\nBut if you create an access control\nlist and you forget that, right?\n\n494\n00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.110\nAnd you're saying, hey,\nI have permitted everything or\n\n495\n00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.110\nI permitted what thought I should've\npermitted, well, that's fine.\n\n496\n00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.107\nThat should get through.\n\n497\n00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:39.457\nBut you're wondering why everything\nelse is not getting through,\n\n498\n00:29:39.457 --> 00:29:42.347\nit's because you forgot that\nthere's an implicit deny.\n\n499\n00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:46.151\nBut let me go back to this\ndiagram here for a moment, and\n\n500\n00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.400\nlet's take a look at something\nright here too, okay?\n\n501\n00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.660\nSo let me unhide this for\na moment and do this, okay?\n\n502\n00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:01.320\nSo for example, right now in what we've\njust done, if we take a look at access\n\n503\n00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.050\nlist 10, let's say that we've denied this,\nwhich is exactly what we did here.\n\n504\n00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.770\nBut remember that at the end of that,\nthere's actually a deny any statement.\n\n505\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.670\nEven though we don't see it,\nit's right here.\n\n506\n00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.670\nSo if we do something like this, okay?\n\n507\n00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:21.640\nSo, Zach, even though I'm only,\naccording to what I typed in,\n\n508\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.370\nI'm denying only 192.196.8.16.10,\nif something else goes into the router\n\n509\n00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:31.110\nthat's 16.16 or 17, or 18, or 19, it then\ndoesn't match this first statement but\n\n510\n00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.730\neventually it will match\nthe second statement.\n\n511\n00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.930\nAnd if it does that,\nthat means it blocks everything.\n\n512\n00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:36.710\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n513\n00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.610\n&gt;&gt; It blocks everything, and that's\nsomething we have to be careful about.\n\n514\n00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.130\nThere has to be at least\none permit statement for\n\n515\n00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.310\nthat to actually end up working for us.\n\n516\n00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.480\nNow let's take a look at\nthis other side here, okay?\n\n517\n00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.890\nIf I truly only want to block\na single address here, okay?\n\n518\n00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.521\nSo taking the same thing here,\nthis is what we would also have to do.\n\n519\n00:30:58.521 --> 00:31:03.055\nSo not only do we have the same deny\nstatement that we had over on the other\n\n520\n00:31:03.055 --> 00:31:07.820\nside, but I would explicitly need\nan allow statement here, okay?\n\n521\n00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:12.791\nSo I would add in a second statement\nthat allows me to do this,\n\n522\n00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:16.311\nwhere it says access-list 1 permit any.\n\n523\n00:31:16.311 --> 00:31:20.415\nAnd that means as long as\nit matches 16.10, deny it.\n\n524\n00:31:20.415 --> 00:31:25.545\nBut if 16.16, 16.17,\n16.18, it comes through,\n\n525\n00:31:25.545 --> 00:31:29.710\nit won't match entry 10,\nit'll match entry 20.\n\n526\n00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.240\nSo it will be allowed to go through.\n\n527\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.320\nIf it doesn't match any of that,\ndeny, okay?\n\n528\n00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.850\nSo it is this process and\n\n529\n00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.160\nthis order of process that we\nalso have to worry about too.\n\n530\n00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.060\nSo that is at least the beginning of\nsome of the things that we have to\n\n531\n00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.520\nkind of understand as we get set up for\nthis.\n\n532\n00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.610\nNow Zach, we're by no means done.\n\n533\n00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.612\nBut at least for this episode,\nwe're running out of time.\n\n534\n00:31:50.612 --> 00:31:53.324\nSo we probably need to come back and\nwhen we do,\n\n535\n00:31:53.324 --> 00:31:57.863\nwe'll also talk about this idea of\napplying the access list onto the router.\n\n536\n00:31:57.863 --> 00:32:02.074\nAnd I’ll also talk about directionality,\nas well as in the inbound and\n\n537\n00:32:02.074 --> 00:32:03.010\noutbound too.\n\n538\n00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.360\nSo there’s a lot more configuration to go,\nbut I’m just out of time for this episode.\n\n539\n00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.240\n&gt;&gt; Wait for the part the two of\nconfigure standard access lists.\n\n540\n00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.423\nYou've seen part one.\n\n541\n00:32:10.423 --> 00:32:13.802\nAnd before we move on, I know, Ronnie,\nI know you wanna say something else.\n\n542\n00:32:13.802 --> 00:32:14.930\nI can tell.\n\n543\n00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember,\n\n544\n00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.280\nI'm not gonna tell you that this is the\neasiest concept to get right away, okay?\n\n545\n00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.510\nEspecially if this is\nthe first time you've seen it.\n\n546\n00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.450\nMake sure you go back and\nyou practice the steps and you understand.\n\n547\n00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.899\nGo line by line like I did here,\nand explain,\n\n548\n00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:31.321\nand make sure it makes sense to\nyou as you go through and do this.\n\n549\n00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:33.890\nThere's a lot of rules dealing\nwith access control lists.\n\n550\n00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.895\nAnd at the end of the series,\nwell, hopefully, if I remember,\n\n551\n00:32:36.895 --> 00:32:40.756\nwe'll review some of those rules as well\nthat will help you to get this settled in.\n\n552\n00:32:40.756 --> 00:32:42.468\nBut we still got a lot of configuration.\n\n553\n00:32:42.468 --> 00:32:44.390\nYou gotta remember that\nwe're only halfway through.\n\n554\n00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.730\nBecause we've configured an access list,\nwe just haven't applied it anywhere.\n\n555\n00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.115\nAnd that's the second part of\ngetting access control lists down.\n\n556\n00:32:51.115 --> 00:32:52.540\nBut we'll do that in our next episode.\n\n557\n00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, great advice, great show and\nmake sure you see everything.\n\n558\n00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.040\nAll the episodes inside the Cisco CCent\nseries that Ronnie's put together for you.\n\n559\n00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.490\nYou will be very glad you did.\n\n560\n00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.161\nAnd by the way,\n\n561\n00:33:03.161 --> 00:33:06.429\nit'll be in the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos.\n\n562\n00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:08.258\nAnd they are there to help you go further.\n\n563\n00:33:08.258 --> 00:33:09.654\nSo check those out too.\n\n564\n00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:11.699\nTell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n565\n00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:13.800\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n566\n00:33:13.800

00:00:08.139\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.964\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.911\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:25.290\nThis is gonna be part two of\nConfigure Standard Access Lists.\n\n8\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.327\nAnd once again, Ronnie Wong has said, I'm\ngonna drop by and help you out with that.\n\n9\n00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:30.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here he is, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.590\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.370\nAs we continue on in our\nCCENT journey once again,\n\n13\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.070\nremember that we were\nin the middle of a lab.\n\n14\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.440\nWe are configuring, of course,\na standard access control list.\n\n15\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.517\nNow we're not only gonna be doing that,\n\n16\n00:00:43.517 --> 00:00:47.184\nwe're also gonna end up configuring\nan extended access control list,\n\n17\n00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:50.993\nas well as even a named one so that you\ncan see and compare the differences.\n\n18\n00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:54.458\nBut according to Cisco's CCENT and\ntheir own exam objectives,\n\n19\n00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.448\nthat they're only really focusing in\non standard access control lists.\n\n20\n00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:03.450\nBut like everything else, those exam\nobjectives are subject to change.\n\n21\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.507\nAnd I can pretty much tell you that you're\nprobably gonna see a mix of all three\n\n22\n00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:08.080\non there.\n\n23\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.038\nSo even though they say they're really\nonly focusing on standard access\n\n24\n00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.702\ncontrol lists, some of the details\nthat you'll be asked about,\n\n25\n00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.090\nthat's probably what you'll end up seeing.\n\n26\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.715\nBut the ability to distinguish this\nfrom an extended one versus a named one\n\n27\n00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:22.512\nis also gonna be key for you.\n\n28\n00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:25.580\nBut we'll make sure that you can actually\nsee the difference between those two.\n\n29\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.935\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n&gt;&gt; So in our first episode in this little\n\n30\n00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:33.560\nminiseries that we've taken on here, we\nahead in and we configured access control\n\n31\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.210\nlists on a router, and\nwe also talked about some of the details.\n\n32\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.230\nSo let's go back here, and\nwe'll take a look again.\n\n33\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.490\nAnd let me zoom in so that we can\nsee it just a little bit better,\n\n34\n00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.280\nas well as we just trying\nto get down there.\n\n35\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.792\nSo we had just shown the access\ncontrol list itself, and\n\n36\n00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:57.367\nhere was our last configurations\nthat we manually typed in, right?\n\n37\n00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.880\nWe see two standard access control\nlist where we had configured them.\n\n38\n00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.744\nAnd we also, of course, talked about\nthis idea of the processing order that\n\n39\n00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:08.558\nyou have to be aware of and\nan implicit deny.\n\n40\n00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:13.388\nI would make sure that I go back in, along\nwith whatever other study materials that\n\n41\n00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:18.358\nyou're looking at, understand that idea,\nespecially with the implicit deny that\n\n42\n00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.523\nit's not gonna show up even\nwith show access-list.\n\n43\n00:02:21.523 --> 00:02:23.020\nYou're not gonna see it.\n\n44\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.390\nBut if you don't see an explicit entry,\nit means it's implicitly denied.\n\n45\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.680\nSo don't think that if you see\nan entry that just says permit\n\n46\n00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.840\nthat that that's all that there is.\n\n47\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.700\nIf everything else besides what's in that\npermit statement is still getting denied,\n\n48\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.570\nit means you have to add\nin at least one more\n\n49\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.590\nentry in there to ensure that other\nthings can also get through, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.170\nSo make sure you do that, and\nthat's where we've kind of left off.\n\n51\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.620\nNow the other part of,\nof course, getting to\n\n52\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.840\nan access control list to work is\napplying it to an interface, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.670\nSo creating the access control list\nreally does nothing except for,\n\n54\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.018\nsay, here's the logic that's in place.\n\n55\n00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:10.500\nNow we have to take that logic, and\nwe now have to apply it to a router, and\n\n56\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.380\nspecifically to an interface and\ngive direction to it as well.\n\n57\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.150\nSo at this particular point, as we do so,\nwe're gonna use that same diagram,\n\n58\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.260\nand I'll try to simplify it a little\nbit more here, to talk about this\n\n59\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.200\nidea of where the access list should\ngo when you start to do this.\n\n60\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.090\nSo if I wanted to control what\nit actually was doing, so\n\n61\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.720\nwe're gonna use access\nlist ten as our example.\n\n62\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.910\nAnd in access list ten,\n\n63\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.940\nI wanna make sure that I'm telling you\nright, we are denying one IP address.\n\n64\n00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.510\nSo that's the one IP address that\nwe're denying, which is fine, 16.10.\n\n65\n00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.000\nSo if we come over here,\nhere's 16.10, and I want to\n\n66\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.190\ndeny its ability to do one thing.\n\n67\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.105\nAccording to the directions in your\nlab guide, you're denying access to\n\n68\n00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:08.196\npractice-labs.com, www.practice-labs.com.\n\n69\n00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:13.130\nSo once we've created that\naccess list on this router,\n\n70\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.160\nI also am going to need to apply\nthis on an interface as well.\n\n71\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.710\nSo there's two different ways\nthat this can be done, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.197\nSo of course, we need to\nactually do inbound or outbound.\n\n73\n00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:28.890\nAnd let's talk about this idea of\nI change this to inbound, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.903\nIf you change an access list and\nthen you put it on an interface,\n\n75\n00:04:32.903 --> 00:04:36.109\nyou're going to select that interface,\nright?\n\n76\n00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:40.408\nYou're gonna go into your global config,\ndo an interface gigabit ethernet 0/0.\n\n77\n00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:49.560\nThen you can type in ip acess-group\nthe number of the access, which is 10.\n\n78\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.150\nAnd you're gonna say inbound.\n\n79\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.750\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n80\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.024\nWell, remember that access-group is how we\ngroup this list to the interface, okay?\n\n81\n00:05:00.024 --> 00:05:01.850\nSo that's what we're saying\nhere in that access-group.\n\n82\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.425\nWe're saying group that access\nlist 10 to this interface.\n\n83\n00:05:06.425 --> 00:05:11.378\nAnd we're monitoring for\nwhether it's inbound or outbound here.\n\n84\n00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:15.860\nSo we've put in the word in,\nlike I have right here, okay?\n\n85\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.050\nWhat does that really mean?\n\n86\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.130\nThat is about the traffic.\n\n87\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.980\nAnd what that means is\ncoming into the interface.\n\n88\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.366\nNow whenever we talk about\ndirectionality for a router's interface,\n\n89\n00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:32.530\nit's always from outside\ncoming into the router, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.430\nSo that is kind of where the terminology\nkinda gets a little bit strict.\n\n91\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.080\nSo in other words, for us,\nin this diagram, okay, when we do that and\n\n92\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.066\nwe apply access-group 10 in,\nwe're saying as it comes into\n\n93\n00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:51.640\ngigabit ethernet 0/0, okay,\n\n94\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.090\nas it does that, this is where\nthat access list 10 will apply.\n\n95\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.396\nSo in access list 10,\nif we go back here, okay,\n\n96\n00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:05.930\nwe'll see that that's\nexactly what happens.\n\n97\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.294\nIs that at that particular interface,\nthen, it should go ahead and\n\n98\n00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:16.202\nblock that from getting access in,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n99\n00:06:16.202 --> 00:06:21.864\nThat effectively right now does\ndo what we need it to do, okay?\n\n100\n00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:26.730\nThat will prevent it from\ngetting to practice-labs.com.\n\n101\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.832\nNow, there can be a problem though, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:28.832 --> 00:06:33.020\nSo Zach, let me kind of do little bit\nof an ad lib here just for a moment.\n\n103\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.876\nLet's say, though,\nthat there is a partner group for us.\n\n104\n00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:44.179\nWe'll call it ourpartner.com.\n\n105\n00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:47.584\nAnd let's say that for\nsome reason or the other,\n\n106\n00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:50.525\nthey're off of this interface instead.\n\n107\n00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:54.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n108\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:02.960\n&gt;&gt; So this interface, let's just do\nthis one, And let's change it here.\n\n109\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.370\nNow if I do that and we change that up,\n\n110\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.690\nif I have the access-group here for\n10 going inbound,\n\n111\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.910\nokay, and my specific requirement,\nokay, was essentially to block,\n\n112\n00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:25.588\nMe from getting there, right,\n\n113\n00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:32.290\nnow its only requirement was\nto protect me and there.\n\n114\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.998\nOf course, why would it actually allow me\nto choose both of them at the same time?\n\n115\n00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:40.480\nThat'd be silly, so\nthat was my only requirement here.\n\n116\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.770\nAnd apparently I even chose\ntwo different colors there.\n\n117\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.410\nI can see it now.\n\n118\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.090\nThat's amazing.\n\n119\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.610\nThat is really amazing.\n\n120\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.130\nAll right, let me group that together.\n\n121\n00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.470\nAll right, I'm gonna leave it,\ncuz now I'm done.\n\n122\n00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.060\nSo that's my only requirement.\n\n123\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.632\nIs there an issue if I go ahead and\nadd that to this interface?\n\n124\n00:08:00.632 --> 00:08:03.817\nWell, yeah.\nBecause that only blocks it there, but\n\n125\n00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.385\nif you think about it,\n\n126\n00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:11.420\nit also effectively blocks it from going\naway to our partner as well, right?\n\n127\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.730\nBecause I blocked it at this interface.\n\n128\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, you blocked it at the interface.\n\n129\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif I blocked it at that interface,\n\n130\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.460\nit's gonna block it from getting\neverywhere besides, what?\n\n131\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.890\nThe one place that I needed it,\n\n132\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.730\nwhich is the only requirement was\nto block it from practice-labs.com.\n\n133\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.070\nNow, so what do I do then?\n\n134\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.540\nHow do I do this?\n\n135\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.390\nWell, what I need to do then is to maybe\nfind something that is actually a little\n\n136\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.150\nbit more specific, and I can do this of\ncourse with the directionality as well.\n\n137\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.822\nSo instead, I might move and\n\n138\n00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:48.111\nconfigure g or gigabyte 0/1.\n\n139\n00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:54.980\nAnd I might say not going inbound because\ninbound will be from practicelabs.com.\n\n140\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.310\nBut instead just say, look, I want to\nblock it coming outbound instead, okay?\n\n141\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.150\nSo, if I block it out-bound,\nin this theory, in theory at least,\n\n142\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.390\nright, it would actually\ngo through the router.\n\n143\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:16.661\nAnd then at g0/1, it would also\nrun across the access-group 10,\n\n144\n00:09:16.661 --> 00:09:21.270\nit would match up to 192.168.16.10.\n\n145\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.040\nAnd it would actually be denied out.\n\n146\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.050\nSo in other words, it would block\nit from leaving the interface.\n\n147\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.524\nSo maybe that's a better syntax\nto actually use either going\n\n148\n00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:36.190\ninto the interface is inbound.\n\n149\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:41.420\nAnd then outbound or out at the end\nis leaving in the interface, okay?\n\n150\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.250\nSo I might chose instead to do that, okay?\n\n151\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.160\nAnd that would effectively block me\nfrom getting access to Practicelabs.com.\n\n152\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.590\nBut notice it would also allow me do what,\nto go through and\n\n153\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.550\nget access to ourpartner.com.\n\n154\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.863\nAnd that's exactly what I need,\nI need to able to get access here but\n\n155\n00:09:59.863 --> 00:10:01.560\nnot to here, okay?\n\n156\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.590\nSo I could actually choose either way, but\nthis is where it comes with experience and\n\n157\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.880\nwith practice.\n\n158\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.260\nIt's nothing that you learn immediately or\nright away until you practice it and\n\n159\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.740\nuntil you see it, of where would be\nthe most effective place to put it.\n\n160\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.000\nBut there is a, I don't know what to\ncall it, it's not even a rule of thumb.\n\n161\n00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.961\nThere is essentially Cisco best practices.\n\n162\n00:10:25.961 --> 00:10:28.886\nAnd that means they're not\nwritten down anywhere,\n\n163\n00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:33.820\nthere's no documentation that absolutely\nsays it has to be this way, okay?\n\n164\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.780\nBut in theory, the way that Cisco\nseems to provide it here, right?\n\n165\n00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.730\nIs that if we create\na standard access list,\n\n166\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.160\nnot an extended access list,\nbut a standard access list.\n\n167\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.426\nThe closest that we can put it\nto the destination network,okay?\n\n168\n00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:57.792\nIn other words, the closest that we can\nput that access list to the destination\n\n169\n00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:00.530\nnetwork that is the place that\nstandard access list should be.\n\n170\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.680\n&gt;&gt; Because it allows for\nthis type of connection to still go on\n\n171\n00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.090\nwhile blocking that specific connection\nbecause only based on the source.\n\n172\n00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.540\nSo that means that there is\na canvas to this as well as that.\n\n173\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.730\nIf I create an extended access control\nlist, which we haven't talked about,\n\n174\n00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.740\nbut we'll mention it right now.\n\n175\n00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.206\nExtended access control lists,\ntake into account those source and\n\n176\n00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:26.644\ndestination, as well as protocol.\n\n177\n00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:31.760\nWell that one, we wanna put it as\nclose to the source as possible.\n\n178\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.626\nBecause, at that point, we can filter\nout either the source address, or, and\n\n179\n00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:38.596\nthe destination, right then.\n\n180\n00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:42.130\nBefore it actually has to go\nthrough the router any further.\n\n181\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.300\nSo that's what you want to do there.\n\n182\n00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.770\nSo extend it as close to the source as\npossible but add the idea of standard\n\n183\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:55.970\nones, we want it as far away, or closer\nto the destination, as possible as well.\n\n184\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.840\nNow, there does come the statement\nthat I left up here because I didn't\n\n185\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.590\nwant to forget it.\n\n186\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:10.530\nYou can also only have one access/group\nstatement per interface, per direction.\n\n187\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.100\nNow, that's a confusing statement.\n\n188\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.692\nIt's always been confusing to me\nespecially as I've, you know when I was\n\n189\n00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:18.890\n[INAUDIBLE] I was like,\nwhat the heck does that actually mean?\n\n190\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.330\nWell that means at least\nat this point right,\n\n191\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.850\nlet's say that we've selected\ngigabit ethernet 0/1 okay?\n\n192\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.920\nIf I want to apply that access list\n10 to this interface using the out\n\n193\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.639\nstatement like I've just done here.\n\n194\n00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:38.321\nI cannot bring up an IP access\ndash group 12, or 22, or\n\n195\n00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:43.510\n32, and have all three of\nthem apply at the same time.\n\n196\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.630\nThey'll just replace one\nafter the other if I do that.\n\n197\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.260\nNow could I actually create an IP\naccess dash group 20 inbound?\n\n198\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.680\nIn other words,\ncoming in from practicelab.com, going in.\n\n199\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.950\nYes, I could do that.\n\n200\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:03.230\nBut I can only have one per\ndirection on that interface.\n\n201\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.380\nSo remember that if somebody says hey,\nyou need to actually add this one in here.\n\n202\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.790\nWell, if it's the same interface and\nthe same in direction out and\n\n203\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.796\nthat same interface in\nthat same direction.\n\n204\n00:13:14.796 --> 00:13:17.490\nYou're just going to replace one or\nthe other.\n\n205\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.270\nThey will not be added, they won't\nbe merged, they won't do that, okay?\n\n206\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.270\nBut that is kind of the key for\n\n207\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.550\nus as well is understand that they\nwill just overwrite one another.\n\n208\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.460\nAnd that, that will of course effectively\nknock out what you wanted to be able to\n\n209\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.370\ndo, okay?\n\n210\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.020\nSo that is what we're actually doing next.\n\n211\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.856\nSo there's a lot, yeah, just when you go,\nman, access lists sound pretty darn cool.\n\n212\n00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:41.920\nBecause we can restrict traffic,\nwe can filter it out, and we can deny it.\n\n213\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.534\nWe can do all of that stuff, but\n\n214\n00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:47.528\nlook at all the rules that you have to\nknow about to just get them done, okay?\n\n215\n00:13:47.528 --> 00:13:51.200\nSo it is a lot, a lot,\na lot of information.\n\n216\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.030\nAll right so\nlet's see it in practice too okay?\n\n217\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.907\nSo the great thing is we're just\ngonna pick on access list 10,\n\n218\n00:13:56.907 --> 00:13:59.430\nwhich is kinda the example\nthat we've been using here.\n\n219\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.220\nAnd let me make sure, there we go, okay?\n\n220\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.230\nMake sure that you all can see that,\nis kind of the key is what I want to do.\n\n221\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.180\nNow, that means I need to go\ninto our global configuration\n\n222\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.780\nmode to get access of\ncourse to the interface.\n\n223\n00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.120\nLet's try this again.\n\n224\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.430\nOops, okay, they kicked me out.\n\n225\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.022\nThat's what happened.\n\n226\n00:14:20.022 --> 00:14:27.477\nAll right so\nnow I can go into global configuration.\n\n227\n00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:32.159\nAnd inside of global configuration,\n\n228\n00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:36.860\ninterface gigabit ethernet 0/1.\n\n229\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:44.400\nAnd now it's ip access-group, okay?\n\n230\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.460\nRemember that syntax is not access-list,\nIt's down here in the black instead of\n\n231\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.060\nwhere it should normally be here,\nip access-group here, okay?\n\n232\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.045\nSo remember not access-list but\naccess-group.\n\n233\n00:14:58.045 --> 00:15:00.640\nAnd then we're gonna select outbound.\n\n234\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.590\nNow before I do that,\n\n235\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.860\nlet me see if there's any other\nsyntax that's there, okay?\n\n236\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.660\nSo ooh, I've forgotten that one.\n\n237\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.340\nSo IP access-group and\nthen we're gonna select 10.\n\n238\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.610\nI want to see if there's\nanything else that we have, okay?\n\n239\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.800\nSo there's only two options, that's\nwhat I wanted to make sure of there,\n\n240\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.336\nthat there were only two\noptions that were left.\n\n241\n00:15:18.336 --> 00:15:22.251\nSo now outbound, out okay?\n\n242\n00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:27.310\nSee IP access-group 10 out.\n\n243\n00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.490\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna actually go ahead and\n\n244\n00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.030\nput that on to that interface, okay?\n\n245\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.196\nSo in theory everything\nis setup correctly,\n\n246\n00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:39.388\nat least according to the diagram\nthat I showed you that everything\n\n247\n00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:41.505\nis actually working\nthe way that we want to.\n\n248\n00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:44.320\nAnd that should be it for what we know.\n\n249\n00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.750\nAll right so\nnow that we've gotten that one, and\n\n250\n00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.650\neverything is ready, I now need to verify\nthat something like this is working.\n\n251\n00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.432\nIf it's not working it means I have to\ntroubleshoot something a little bit\n\n252\n00:15:55.432 --> 00:15:57.877\nfurther, and\nthat may end up having to happen.\n\n253\n00:15:57.877 --> 00:16:03.466\nSo let me select This,\nwhich is gonna be our test machine, okay?\n\n254\n00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:06.447\nPLAB CSCO 01, go figure,\n\n255\n00:16:06.447 --> 00:16:12.890\nI don't know where the name came from,\nbut that's fine.\n\n256\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:17.290\nSo it's supposed to be, of course,\nPractice Labs whatever CSCO means,\n\n257\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:17.970\nthat's fine.\n\n258\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.612\n[COUGH] What I wanna do, of course,\n\n259\n00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:24.265\nis just see if I can connect\nto that web browser.\n\n260\n00:16:24.265 --> 00:16:30.492\nSo I just opened up the web browser, and\nfrom here, I should be able to do http.\n\n261\n00:16:30.492 --> 00:16:33.602\nIt just has me doing www.\n\n262\n00:16:33.602 --> 00:16:38.542\nWww.practicelabs.com, and press Enter.\n\n263\n00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:46.425\nAnd so now,\nwe're actually waiting to see whether or\n\n264\n00:16:46.425 --> 00:16:48.941\nnot it is actually working or not here.\n\n265\n00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.560\nSo we're just gonna give it a moment.\n\n266\n00:16:53.349 --> 00:16:55.820\nAnd it actually looks like it\ntook me out to the Internet.\n\n267\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.770\nWell, that's unusual,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n268\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.550\nsee if it actually gives me access\nto get to our practice labs here.\n\n269\n00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:08.320\nGive it a moment, and\nit says that the page can't be displayed.\n\n270\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.270\nBut it did get me out to the internet,\nwhich is kind of fine, and we're probably\n\n271\n00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:16.500\nwondering why and it might be,\nthere's a couple of other things going on.\n\n272\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.330\nBut it looks like it did\ntry to succeed as well.\n\n273\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.340\nAnd it says it's waiting for\npractice labs, which is fine.\n\n274\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.537\nSo that's a little bit more unusual,\nbut it is possible.\n\n275\n00:17:28.537 --> 00:17:32.083\nLet's go ahead, and now,\nlet's ping that thing too.\n\n276\n00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:35.730\nLet me change this up so that we can\nsee it a little bit more as well.\n\n277\n00:17:39.512 --> 00:17:42.510\nChange the text here so\nit's a color that we can see.\n\n278\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:52.142\nI'm gonna try and\nping www.practice-labs.com.\n\n279\n00:17:52.142 --> 00:17:53.670\nMake sure I'm typing it right.\n\n280\n00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:07.510\nAll right so now, this time it's\nactually not responding at all.\n\n281\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.810\nSo it looks like it is working, okay?\n\n282\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:15.473\nSo now, we have this lab which looks\nlike it is actually working here.\n\n283\n00:18:15.473 --> 00:18:17.418\nNow, let's check out\nthe other side of this.\n\n284\n00:18:17.418 --> 00:18:24.920\nSo if I go back to NYEDGE1, And\nlet's see what the results are and see.\n\n285\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.400\nMaybe if I was expecting it\nto work that's what I want.\n\n286\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.960\nIf I wasn't expecting it to work,\nthen I need to figure out why.\n\n287\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.196\nSo let's do an exit here, and then\nlet's type in, let's do an exit again.\n\n288\n00:18:36.196 --> 00:18:41.193\nShow, Make sure I'm\n\n289\n00:18:41.193 --> 00:18:45.907\ntyping in the right one, access-lists.\n\n290\n00:18:50.476 --> 00:18:53.150\nAnd now,\nwe can take a look at something here, and\n\n291\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.330\nI'm starting to see something, okay.\n\n292\n00:18:57.338 --> 00:19:01.400\nWhen I take a look at this versus,\noops, just these first two.\n\n293\n00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:05.730\nNotice that I don't see anything\nthat looks like it's changed.\n\n294\n00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:09.974\nVersus when I take a look\nat this last one here,\n\n295\n00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:13.830\nnotice it says nine matches got through,\nokay?\n\n296\n00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.290\nIf my access list was working at all,\nokay,\n\n297\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.600\nwhich it's not, I should actually\nsee at least this one right here.\n\n298\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.290\nOkay?\n\n299\n00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.450\nActually, I guess technically,\nthis one first.\n\n300\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.240\nOkay?\n\n301\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.310\nThis one should end up doing something\nexcept that this is not on the interface\n\n302\n00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.050\nso we don't have to worry about this one.\n\n303\n00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:41.340\nBut this one right here, I should have\nhad matches that were blocking it anyway.\n\n304\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:47.126\nOkay, but this is not blocking it out,\nand now, permit 16.0,\n\n305\n00:19:47.126 --> 00:19:52.690\nit says it did end up matching so\nit did get through this interface here so\n\n306\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:57.540\nI do have an issue that is going\non as I start seeing this.\n\n307\n00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.290\nNow, you might be wondering, why would\nit have actually succeeded in this?\n\n308\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.390\nBut I'm assuming that right now,\n\n309\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.550\nas far as what I can see here,\nthat idea, the practice-labs,\n\n310\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.960\nthat internal website they gave us to be\nable to gain access is not exactly up.\n\n311\n00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.410\nBut it is actually working\nbecause it did go out.\n\n312\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.630\nSo it should actually have\ngiven me a match at some point.\n\n313\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.040\nAt least, right here was denying it, okay?\n\n314\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.770\nSo we should have seen\nsome match right here\n\n315\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.630\nif it actually did end up getting denied,\nbut it didn't.\n\n316\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.320\nSo the only thing that's working\nright is that it's going through,\n\n317\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.610\nit's not hitting anything.\n\n318\n00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.790\nSo that means that the server\nside is not up and\n\n319\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.520\nrunning the way that it needs to be.\n\n320\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.380\nBut for us, though, it didn't actually\nend up getting denied out, okay?\n\n321\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.672\nAnd that is the problem\nthat we're talking about.\n\n322\n00:20:45.672 --> 00:20:46.817\nNow, there's a reason for that.\n\n323\n00:20:46.817 --> 00:20:53.540\nThe reason why this didn't get denied out\nis because once it hit that interface.\n\n324\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:59.670\nNotice that it did actually get turned\ninto whatever NAT said it was, okay?\n\n325\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.763\nSo for this particular interface here,\nlet's do a show ip\n\n326\n00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:09.370\ninterface brief.\n\n327\n00:21:12.436 --> 00:21:13.283\nAnd now look.\n\n328\n00:21:13.283 --> 00:21:17.568\n17214.0.1 is on that interface, okay?\n\n329\n00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:22.283\nIn network address translation,\nthat means it's gonna\n\n330\n00:21:22.283 --> 00:21:26.801\ntake whatever network that\nwe've assigned in that and\n\n331\n00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:30.449\nit's gonna change it into this IP address.\n\n332\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:40.224\nWell, as it left that interface it\nactually reported itself as 172.14.0.1,\n\n333\n00:21:40.224 --> 00:21:44.355\nand not as 192.168.16.10.\n\n334\n00:21:44.355 --> 00:21:48.190\nThat's because it went ahead and\ntranslated it.\n\n335\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.790\nSo that is why this did\nnot get matched here.\n\n336\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.730\nBut it did get matched right here.\n\n337\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.840\nSo there are other issues that you\nhave to consider when you do that.\n\n338\n00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.760\nSo in our instance here,\neven though the best practice is\n\n339\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.690\nthe closest that we can put to\nthe destination the better it is,\n\n340\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.820\nwhat we want to do then is we wanna move\nthis over to this interface instead.\n\n341\n00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.150\nSo if we instead change\nthat to this interface,\n\n342\n00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.160\nnow we should see where\nwe can block it out.\n\n343\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.060\nAnd it should match.\n\n344\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.390\nSo let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n345\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.040\nSo let me get rid of that configuration,\nlet me get back in here.\n\n346\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.860\nAnd I'll take a look at the time,\n\n347\n00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.420\nmake sure that I've still got\na moment here that I can do this.\n\n348\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.463\nAnd we'll get back into\nthe interface gigabit 0/1.\n\n349\n00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:51.081\nAnd then, no ip access-group 10 outbound.\n\n350\n00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:59.150\nSo I'm taking that off of that interface,\nthen I'm going to go to interface gig0/0,\n\n351\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:04.690\nthen we're gonna do ip access-group\n\n352\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:09.400\n10 inbound instead.\n\n353\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.730\nSo I've taken off one interface, I've now\nadded it on to the other interface here.\n\n354\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.990\nNow, let's try this again and\n\n355\n00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.890\nsee if we can get the confirmation\nthat we want here, too.\n\n356\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.740\nSo now, let's try and ping it again.\n\n357\n00:23:25.442 --> 00:23:29.060\nSo this is now going to out, and\nwe're getting the same result,\n\n358\n00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.770\nwhich is fine, okay?\n\n359\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.550\nSo I just want to make sure that\nwe're getting what we need to.\n\n360\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.020\nSo now, I'm getting denied here.\n\n361\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.050\nBut did the router pick it up as it deny.\n\n362\n00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.330\nIn other words, is the access list\nworking is what I want to prove here.\n\n363\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n364\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.230\n&gt;&gt; So now, let's see.\n\n365\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.849\nAnd we'll show you a difference here.\n\n366\n00:23:44.849 --> 00:23:47.450\nSo now, over on NYEDGE1.\n\n367\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.960\nLet me get out of here.\n\n368\n00:23:53.052 --> 00:23:56.480\nShow access dash list.\n\n369\n00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.790\nAnd now, take a look.\n\n370\n00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.930\nI know that my access list\nis now configured correctly\n\n371\n00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:08.630\nregardless of whether or\nnot the other web server,\n\n372\n00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.975\nthe www practice labs is up or not,\nI can see where this got denied,\n\n373\n00:24:13.975 --> 00:24:17.845\nso I know that the axis list is\nconfigured correctly here, okay?\n\n374\n00:24:17.845 --> 00:24:22.525\nSo this is a big part of what we have\nto at least be able to verify and do.\n\n375\n00:24:22.525 --> 00:24:26.695\nSo remember that at this point when\nwe start to see something like this,\n\n376\n00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:30.530\nit does at least show\nus that we can do this.\n\n377\n00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.770\nAnd a standard access control list is\nalways good for something like this.\n\n378\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:39.010\nA simple way to identify that traffic, and\nthen to restrict it whether we want to\n\n379\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.830\nallow it to come in or outbound as well\nand whether we want to deny or permit.\n\n380\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.340\nSo make sure you do take\na look at that too, all right?\n\n381\n00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.960\nSo Zach, we are done in terms of\n\n382\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.520\njust configuring a simple standard\nstandard access control list.\n\n383\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.240\nSo at this point, that's actually\na good place for us to stop and\n\n384\n00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.200\nthen we still need to configure some\nextended access control lists, as well.\n\n385\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.050\nWe'll pick that up in another episode,\nas well.\n\n386\n00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.790\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe will configure standard access lists.\n\n387\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.930\nPart three, and\nmake sure you see part one and two.\n\n388\n00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.810\nSee them all, very important,\nbefore we move on.\n\n389\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.690\nRonnie, anything else you'd like to say?\n\n390\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nlet's make sure that we understand, right?\n\n391\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:21.950\nThe very fact is beginning here,\nwith standard access control lists,\n\n392\n00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.450\nthey are going to actually be important\nfor us, so make sure you take the time to\n\n393\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.440\ngo back through and understand\nthe components that we were pointing out.\n\n394\n00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.880\nIt is very important that you do so.\n\n395\n00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.215\nAnd again, practice every day is\nkind of the key here as we do that.\n\n396\n00:25:38.215 --> 00:25:39.357\nSo just pay attention.\n\n397\n00:25:39.357 --> 00:25:40.645\nDo more practice.\n\n398\n00:25:40.645 --> 00:25:44.047\nMake sure you get these concept cuz\nthere's a lot more concepts than just\n\n399\n00:25:44.047 --> 00:25:48.175\nthree or four simple statements that we've\ndone, and they're not as intuitive as some\n\n400\n00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:51.290\nof the other ones that we've\ndone a little bit earlier.\n\n401\n00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.360\nSo slow down through here and make\nsure you understand this a bit better.\n\n402\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n403\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.700\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n404\n00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.720\nA great job.\n\n405\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.650\nAnd make sure you see every\nepisode of Cisco CCENT.\n\n406\n00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.800\nRonnie's put it all together for\nyou to help you out, and it will.\n\n407\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.090\nAnd you'll be in the course\nlibrary as well.\n\n408\n00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.330\nAnd there's all kinds of videos in\nthe course library that are there.\n\n409\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.980\nThey help you go further,\nso check those out too.\n\n410\n00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.990\n&gt;&gt; And\ntell everybody you know about IT Pro TV.\n\n411\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.930\nIT

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n4\n00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.300\nThank you for choosing ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.826\nEmpowering the world with engaging\nknowledge and my name is Zach Memos and\n\n6\n00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:21.603\nI'm your host as we\ncontinue on Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:25.840\nThis is Configured Standard Access Lists,\nPart 3.\n\n8\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.080\nThat's right, make sure you see\nall the parts, very important.\n\n9\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.730\nAnd the person bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n10\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.840\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.446\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, thank you again for\n\n12\n00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:38.494\nhaving me on the show as we continue on\nin our journey here through CCENT and\n\n13\n00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:41.711\nwe are taking a look at Configuring\nStandard Access Control Lists, Part 3.\n\n14\n00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:45.240\nAnd now you're probably wondering\nlike really, is there that much?\n\n15\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.850\nNot so much that as much as\nthe exam objectives call out,\n\n16\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.490\njust configuring standard\naccess control lists,\n\n17\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.360\nyou will end up probably seeing something\nabout the nature of extended access\n\n18\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.350\ncontrol lists as well as named\naccess control list too.\n\n19\n00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.900\nSo we're covering all that underneath the\numbrella of configuring standard access\n\n20\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.607\ncontrol lists and is what we're doing.\n\n21\n00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:08.215\nSo in this episode we are going to be,\nof course,\n\n22\n00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:13.060\nconfiguring this idea of extended\naccess control list instead.\n\n23\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.620\nSo let's take a look at my diagram and\nthis will hep us out a little bit more.\n\n24\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.760\nSo we're using the same lab topology.\n\n25\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.430\nWe're actually using the same lab that\nwe've been configuring of course,\n\n26\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550\nthe standard access control list but\n\n27\n00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.110\nremember the difference here when\nwe start to take a look right?\n\n28\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.020\nIn a standard access control list\nwe're only concerned about the source\n\n29\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.920\nIP address okay,\nthat's all we're concerned about, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.930\nIt doesn't take into account\nwhat type of traffic,\n\n31\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.260\nit doesn't care what type of traffic.\n\n32\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.110\nWe're only concerned about that,\nbut extended access control\n\n33\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.980\nlists are much more flexible in the very\nfact that what we can do is actually take\n\n34\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.950\ninto account source and destination IP\naddress, as well as the protocol and\n\n35\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.170\neven port number, depending on how\ndetailed you really want to get with what\n\n36\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.500\nwe're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n37\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.930\n&gt;&gt; But the great thing is,\n\n38\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.310\nthat's kinda one of the big differences.\n\n39\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.330\nThe other thing of course,\nis the numbering, too.\n\n40\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.693\nIn a standard access control list,\nremembering we have essentially\n\n41\n00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:17.581\n1 through 99, and then beginning with\nthe extended access control list,\n\n42\n00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:21.209\nit's 100 through 199,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n43\n00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.621\nI wanna make sure I'm telling you about,\nyes, no, yeah, it's 100 or\n\n44\n00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:27.708\n101 through 199,\nI don't know why I forget that number, but\n\n45\n00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:30.540\nit's something that you can look up and\nverify.\n\n46\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.731\nSo just remember that that's\nwhat you're normally seeing, so\n\n47\n00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:36.523\nthose are kind of the numbers\nthat we're dealing with.\n\n48\n00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:41.240\nSo anytime, actually a very good kind of\neasy exam kind of points that you might\n\n49\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.242\nget is, how do you know this is\nan extended access control list, or\n\n50\n00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:48.890\nhow do you know this is\na standard access control list?\n\n51\n00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.660\nWell you can just look at the numbers.\n\n52\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.200\nThat's probably actually a good point or\ntwo,\n\n53\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.380\nand it's actually real easy cuz\nyou only get so many questions.\n\n54\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.450\nSo imagine just getting a question right\njust because you knew the difference\n\n55\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.610\nbetween 1 in 99 and then 101 through 199,\n\n56\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.500\nthat would be cool if I\nactually just got .5.\n\n57\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.290\nAnd you can, you can get points\nlike that very easily on the exam.\n\n58\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.100\n&gt;&gt; That is cool.\n\n59\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.240\n&gt;&gt; So now when we start here, okay, we're\n\n60\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.150\ngonna set up this particular scenario, and\nthis is why it's actually so flexible.\n\n61\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.270\nSo, remember that I just said\nthat it really doesn't matter,\n\n62\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.750\nokay, that as we took a look at this\nsource, at the idea of the standard,\n\n63\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.160\nright, I wanted to block access\nto what practice labs dot com.\n\n64\n00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.930\nBut what if I didn't wanna\nblock access over here?\n\n65\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.550\nWell, I couldn't do that\nwith a standard access\n\n66\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.660\ncontroller.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n67\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Except by placement, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.850\nOnly by placement have I actually moved it\nfrom one interface to another, did I have\n\n69\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.400\nthat hope of doing so, but even in RSS\nthat didn't work as well as we wanted to.\n\n70\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.090\nBut with extended access control list,\nhere's what I can set up.\n\n71\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.131\nOnce again, we're going to our global\nconfiguration mode which is fine,\n\n72\n00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:01.824\naccess-list 110,\nI just chose this number here.\n\n73\n00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.886\nThen we're gonna permit and then,\n\n74\n00:04:04.886 --> 00:04:09.630\nI select the protocol first,\nso what am I permitting?\n\n75\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.570\nTCP is probably one of the more common\nones that you see, you can also do UDP but\n\n76\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.300\nyou wanna everything,\nit's usually gonna be IP,\n\n77\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.090\nIP is everything cuz it's TCPIP, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.260\nSo you can actually permit everything,\nbut here, we're just saying TCP and\n\n79\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.400\nnow the source address, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.832\nNotice as the host which is an alias for\nthis one IP,\n\n81\n00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:38.845\n192.168.16.10, the destination I have any,\nwhich is a match for\n\n82\n00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:43.809\nanything that it wants to go to\nas long as it equals to FTP.\n\n83\n00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.567\nSo this allows me to say, hey,\n\n84\n00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:49.897\nI want to actually make sure that if I\nconnect any place that I'm gonna do it,\n\n85\n00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:52.214\nas long as it's equal to FTP.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n86\n00:04:52.214 --> 00:04:54.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that one protocol.\n\n87\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.400\nNow FTP doesn't function only by itself.\n\n88\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.600\nFTP is one of these rare occasions where\nwhat we have as the port number is\n\n89\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.594\nactually there's two port numbers for\nFTP, 20 and 21, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:06.594 --> 00:05:09.907\nSo the second line is\nessentially the same thing, but\n\n91\n00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:13.370\nthis line allows us to\ntransfer the data instead.\n\n92\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.220\nThat's exactly the same but notice there\nis a different protocol, ftp-data.\n\n93\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.420\nNow you can actually enter in the port\nnumbers if you choose to, 20 and\n\n94\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.160\n21 here is technically what it is.\n\n95\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.900\nBut a lot of times if you take a look and\n\n96\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.820\nyou do the question mark,\nat the end list, it will list,\n\n97\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.320\nusually of course, the protocol and\nnot necessarily the port number.\n\n98\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.280\nSo you'll actually see that too.\n\n99\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.540\nOkay, now the other thing\nbehind this stuff,okay.\n\n100\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.620\nIs that if I go anywhere,\nI want to only connect on FTP, but\n\n101\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.120\nmy third line in this\nactually says deny ICMP.\n\n102\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.389\nOkay, which means prevent the Internet\ncontrol messaging protocol.\n\n103\n00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.171\nFor you and me, that's actually quit a bit\nof information, what we're actually trying\n\n104\n00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:04.651\nto do is just trying to deny ping, what\nwe're denying everything in ICNP instead.\n\n105\n00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:09.231\nSo notice this Zach in one\naccess control list I'm actually\n\n106\n00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.790\nnot only limiting or restricting, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.530\nThat one IP address permitting\nit to go out on FTP but\n\n108\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.990\nthen on that same access control\nlist I'm actually saying.\n\n109\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.920\nBut if you try and\nconnect, if 192.168.16.10,\n\n110\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.590\ntry to connect using ping or\nanything an ICNP, deny, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.245\nSo that is how specific it actually is.\n\n112\n00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:36.457\nNow, it even allows me to do it to a\nspecific host, so here in this third line,\n\n113\n00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:41.436\nnotice I'm actually saying,\nas long as 192.168.16.10 is\n\n114\n00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:46.430\ntrying to go to 172.15.0.10 using ping,\nokay, then deny.\n\n115\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.100\nBut what about every other thing?\n\n116\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.530\nWell, that is where\nthe fourth line comes in.\n\n117\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.170\nEven at the end of extended access control\nlists, there is that implicit Deny all.\n\n118\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.150\nOkay, essentially, for us here, deny any\nto any is what we're actually saying here,\n\n119\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.250\nand now you can see that here\non access-list 110 permit,\n\n120\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.160\nand I say ip which means\nevery other protocol\n\n121\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.710\nthat's actually represented from\nany place going to any place.\n\n122\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.060\nAnd that says hey,\nallow any other traffic to go through.\n\n123\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.040\nBut here's what I'm\nrestricting at this point.\n\n124\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.720\nIf I do not put this fourth statement in\nhere, that is automatically gonna say,\n\n125\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.910\ndeny everything else.\n\n126\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.000\nWhich, at this point,\nmeans only connect on FTP.\n\n127\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.700\nWe do the same thing,\nwe still have to apply it to an interface.\n\n128\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.000\nSo here we're doing the same thing,\nand this time we're gonna apply that\n\n129\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.770\nbest practice where we take an extended\naccess control list, and we apply it as\n\n130\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.340\nclose to the source as possible, where the\nbest practice with standard access control\n\n131\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.240\nlists is to apply it as close\nto the destination as possible.\n\n132\n00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.367\nBut remember, that doesn't always apply\njust like we showed you in our previous\n\n133\n00:07:57.367 --> 00:07:58.890\nconfiguration here, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.540\nSo this is what we'll be setting\nup in our lab as we do so,\n\n135\n00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.264\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n136\n00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:06.557\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go over NYEDGE1 here, and\n\n137\n00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:09.320\nwe are going to start right here again.\n\n138\n00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.590\nAnd the only thing that I've actually done\na little bit differently is I've removed\n\n139\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.750\nthe last access list from\nthat interface that we did\n\n140\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.510\nfrom the previous lab that we were doing.\n\n141\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.210\nOkay, so no IP access-group 10,\nI've removed it off the interface.\n\n142\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.190\nThe list is still there, so\nI'm not getting rid of the list.\n\n143\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.520\nI've just removed it off that interface,\nand\n\n144\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.110\nnow we're ready to configure this\nextended access control list.\n\n145\n00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.990\nSo let's go ahead and get access in.\n\n146\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.720\nAnd we'll get into, of course,\nthe global configuration mode.\n\n147\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.146\nUnless I'm in here,\n\n148\n00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:49.114\nnow we can begin configuring this\nextended access control list.\n\n149\n00:08:49.114 --> 00:08:54.060\nSo access-list, and\nwe'll do the same thing here.\n\n150\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.110\nLet's go ahead and do a question mark,\ncuz I didn't show you this and\n\n151\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.740\nthis is how you can see what\nthe number are and verify.\n\n152\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.599\nSo I was wrong when I said\na little bit earlier it was 101.\n\n153\n00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:04.380\nNotice it shows me right away.\n\n154\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.270\nOkay, 1 through 99 and 100 through 99,\n\n155\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.010\nit is either the extended or\nthe standard here.\n\n156\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.960\nSo I chose 110 just as a little bit\nof an offset here to help us out.\n\n157\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.850\n110, I know that that's right there inside\nof the extended access control list.\n\n158\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.710\nBut you could see some of the other\nones that have been set up there from\n\n159\n00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.330\nages past, right?\n\n160\n00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.290\nSo notice even DECnet is listed here.\n\n161\n00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.690\nAgain, the network that's actually no\nlonger something that we end up using.\n\n162\n00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.680\nAnd then there's even other\nranges that are out there, but\n\n163\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.390\nfor us,\nwe're really gonna stick right here, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.720\nNow, there is an extension list\nwhen they actually went beyond 100.\n\n165\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.710\nNotice that if you go up\nto 1300 through 1999 here,\n\n166\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.860\nthat is an expanded range for extended.\n\n167\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.421\nSo they added in an extra 699, too, and\n\n168\n00:09:52.421 --> 00:10:00.300\nthen 2000 through 2699 is\nthe extended range for extended ones.\n\n169\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.650\nI'm sure somebody out there is using it.\n\n170\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.420\nI'm not gonna use it, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.350\nSo I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n172\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.398\nAll right, so\nlet's do access-list 110, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:10.398 --> 00:10:14.595\nNow that I have access to\naccess-list 110 at this point,\n\n174\n00:10:14.595 --> 00:10:20.410\nI of course now need to decide whether\nI'm permitting or denying it, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.010\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n176\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.490\nJust got to spell access right.\n\n177\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.209\nHow is that?\n\n178\n00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:28.159\nAccess-list 110.\n\n179\n00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.520\nAnd we'll just hit this along the way.\n\n180\n00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.590\nNow, this is a good practice.\n\n181\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.500\nI know it seems long and extraneous as I'm\nexplaining it, but it's good practice for\n\n182\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.020\nyou to do this so\nthat you know what the options are.\n\n183\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.590\nAnd it doesn't hurt for you to go back and\n\n184\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.950\nthen try some of these other\noptions as you do this.\n\n185\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:47.365\nSo at this point,\nwe are going to permit access-list 110,\n\n186\n00:10:47.365 --> 00:10:51.290\nand we are going to permit at this point.\n\n187\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.670\nThen we actually have to\nchoose a protocol, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.410\nNow notice that there are a bunch of\ndifferent protocols that we can choose.\n\n189\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.060\nNow some of these are routing protocols\nwhich is not what we're interested in.\n\n190\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.800\nWe're interested in traffic primarily.\n\n191\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.600\nFor us, it's usually TCP or\nUDP or IP up here.\n\n192\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.330\nAnd in a moment,\nwe'll also configure ICMP as well.\n\n193\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.040\nSo that's another possibility.\n\n194\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.010\nBut those are normally the ones that we're\nactually going to be dealing with at\n\n195\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:22.980\nthis point.\n\n196\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:31.180\nSo we instead are gonna do access-list\npermit, copy that down here.\n\n197\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.395\nThis time we're gonna do TCP,\n\n198\n00:11:36.502 --> 00:11:40.298\nThen I'm going to choose host,\n192.168.16.10.\n\n199\n00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:42.660\nAll right, so\nnow what I need here, of course,\n\n200\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.982\nis gonna be the destination address,\nright?\n\n201\n00:11:44.982 --> 00:11:49.320\nSo I wanna actually allow it to go any\nplace, which is perfectly fine, so\n\n202\n00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.130\nI can use that alias instead,\nwhich is any.\n\n203\n00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.590\nNow of course, at the very end,\nI need this unusual word here.\n\n204\n00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.530\nLet me go ahead and do a question mark so\nthat we can see what happened, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.730\nSo after we actually\nselect the destination,\n\n206\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:08.750\nnotice I have an EQ match only\npackets on a given port number.\n\n207\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.374\nThat is what I'm\nspecifically trying to do.\n\n208\n00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:12.420\nI don't wanna allow all TCP.\n\n209\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.850\nI only really want to allow FTP\nwhich is a TCP protocol, right,\n\n210\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.820\nit's one of the subprotocols under there.\n\n211\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.327\nI want to be able to do that.\n\n212\n00:12:20.327 --> 00:12:23.182\nSo I'm gonna choose EQ right here instead.\n\n213\n00:12:23.182 --> 00:12:29.810\nLet me copy that and kinda paste that\nback in here and make that work.\n\n214\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.180\nThen this is where we get\na list of protocols, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.230\nSo notice now, if I go ahead and\nfill this all out,\n\n216\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.175\nyou can see where it doesn't seem to\nlist a bunch of port numbers over here.\n\n217\n00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:46.438\nAnd you can see, there's the one that\nwe're talking about, which is 21 and 22.\n\n218\n00:12:46.438 --> 00:12:47.221\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n219\n00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:47.813\n&gt;&gt; In theory,\n\n220\n00:12:47.813 --> 00:12:51.841\nI can actually use 21 inside of the\nparentheses there, which is a port number,\n\n221\n00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:55.425\nor I can use the way that it's\nlisted over here, which is fine.\n\n222\n00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:57.037\nCuz you can see where it says, yeah,\n\n223\n00:12:57.037 --> 00:13:00.219\nyou can just list the port number right\nup here at the top, or either one.\n\n224\n00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:04.068\nSo it just depends on, well, us,\nessentially is what it depends on,\n\n225\n00:13:04.068 --> 00:13:07.590\nwhether or\nnot we're actually gonna do either one.\n\n226\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.628\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo eq and then we'll do ftp.\n\n227\n00:13:11.628 --> 00:13:13.664\nIf I remember, that's the right one.\n\n228\n00:13:13.664 --> 00:13:19.030\nYep, ftp, and we are going to\nhit that Enter at that point.\n\n229\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.530\nAnd let's see, what did I do here?\n\n230\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.160\nIt actually says host,\ninvalid detection here.\n\n231\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.530\nSo there's that little dollar sign again,\n\n232\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.580\ntelling me that it's too long for it, and\nthat's why it started to wrap around.\n\n233\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:41.380\nLook, I ended up typing in something else,\nwhich looks like an access list someplace.\n\n234\n00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.799\nLet me try it again here.\n\n235\n00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:48.840\nLet me paste that in, eq and\nthen we'll do ftp one more time.\n\n236\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.150\nLet's see if it accepted it.\n\n237\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.880\nSo that time it accepted it.\n\n238\n00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.262\nNow we're also going to\npaste this in again.\n\n239\n00:13:56.262 --> 00:14:01.125\nAnd instead, we're gonna do ftp-data,\nwhich was the second port, right?\n\n240\n00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:04.403\nThe first 1ftp is port 21,\nthis is port 20.\n\n241\n00:14:04.403 --> 00:14:06.150\nThis is how our data is transferred.\n\n242\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.340\nSo ftp works a little bit weirdly, right?\n\n243\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.160\nWhen you request and say, I need to get\nthis, it actually says, okay, let me\n\n244\n00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.050\ntrigger the data to flow so it switches\nits port number and that's why we have to\n\n245\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.491\ndo both if we are going to do this, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I know you added FTP.\n\n246\n00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:24.740\nNow you're doing the FTP-data,\nso what's the difference?\n\n247\n00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.675\nWell, what are we doing?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so remember that FTP,\n\n248\n00:14:27.675 --> 00:14:28.256\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n249\n00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:29.417\n&gt;&gt; I explained a little bit earlier but\n\n250\n00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:31.625\nlet's make sure that we understand\ncuz this is a little bit tricky,\n\n251\n00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:32.380\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n252\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Normally we don't have to deny one port\n\n253\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.390\nnumber, or permit that one port\nbecause all protocols tend to work\n\n254\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:38.930\non that one port.\n\n255\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.720\nBut FTP is a little bit different.\n\n256\n00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.840\nIt actually works on two different ports.\n\n257\n00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.710\nSo what happens here is that as\nwe sent information to say, hey,\n\n258\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.250\nI need to transfer something with FTP.\n\n259\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.570\nWell, that's some type of control message,\nso that goes over on one protocol, and\n\n260\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:57.270\nthen that triggers the other side\nsaying it's ready to send data.\n\n261\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.370\nSo that's what happens here,\nit actually does work on both.\n\n262\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.500\nSo that's where we're at about data.\n\n263\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.180\nSo let's take a look at the screen again\nhere, and this will kind of help us out.\n\n264\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.810\nSo I just went in and\ncopied and pasted and\n\n265\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.830\nadded in the word data\nfrom the line above.\n\n266\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.890\nAnd now that I have that in there,\nthat I'm perfectly fine with that.\n\n267\n00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:18.654\nWe want to go ahead and\nalso add in access-list 110.\n\n268\n00:15:18.654 --> 00:15:22.520\nThis time we're gonna do a deny icmp.\n\n269\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.450\nNow ICMP is a little bit of a,\nit's an overkill because this is\n\n270\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.950\na relatively large protocol which\nincludes a lot of things including ping.\n\n271\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.060\nSo according to Lab Guide,\nas you read this, right,\n\n272\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.650\nthis thing, we wanna deny pings.\n\n273\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.102\nWell, this is one way to deny pings, but\n\n274\n00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:40.214\nit also denies everything\nelse that works on ICMP.\n\n275\n00:15:40.214 --> 00:15:44.340\nSo it's a bit of an overkill, but\nit can be done this way if you choose to.\n\n276\n00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.397\nSo we're just gonna follow along and\ndo the same thing here,\n\n277\n00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:53.564\nwhich is host 192.168.16.10, and\n\n278\n00:15:53.564 --> 00:15:58.042\nwe're also doing this to 172.15.0.10.\n\n279\n00:15:59.445 --> 00:16:03.070\nAll right, so now I have a combination.\n\n280\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.580\nThis is where that flexibility Of the\nextended access control list works for us.\n\n281\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.790\nIn one access control list, I have both\npermits and denies that I can add in here.\n\n282\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.010\nAnd that will help us out and\nwork the way that we want it to.\n\n283\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.866\nSo once I get that in, let's go ahead and\n\n284\n00:16:18.866 --> 00:16:24.328\nexit out of the global configuration mode,\nand do a show access-list here.\n\n285\n00:16:26.107 --> 00:16:30.209\nNow when we do that, let me make that\nactually a little bit more specific so\n\n286\n00:16:30.209 --> 00:16:33.319\nthat we're only concentrating\nin on the extended one,\n\n287\n00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:35.384\nshow access-list 110 instead.\n\n288\n00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:40.991\nAnd now you'll see that,\nas we take a look here,\n\n289\n00:16:40.991 --> 00:16:45.979\nit is showing me exactly what I was\nhoping to see, which is fine, okay.\n\n290\n00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:50.623\nNow, if you do end up having it where it's\nnot showing you everything that you want\n\n291\n00:16:50.623 --> 00:16:51.647\nto be able to see.\n\n292\n00:16:51.647 --> 00:16:55.200\nYou may have to remove or\nadd in something in between, and\n\n293\n00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.250\nthat's where that 10 and\nthat 20 actually come in.\n\n294\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.340\nNow I can go back in if I need to, and\n\n295\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.350\nadd in, let's say,\na 15 in the access control entry to do so.\n\n296\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.187\nAnd that will also allow me\nto put things in between.\n\n297\n00:17:09.187 --> 00:17:14.198\nNow in our NYEDGE1 here, it doesn't\ngive me the ability, even though\n\n298\n00:17:14.198 --> 00:17:19.812\nit says that it will, give me the ability\nto go between 1 and 9 and add stuff in.\n\n299\n00:17:19.812 --> 00:17:24.762\nBut it looks like this one actually has\na hard set limit where it actually allows\n\n300\n00:17:24.762 --> 00:17:30.730\nfor 11 through 19, but if you try and set\nsomething to 1 through 9, it doesn't work.\n\n301\n00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.080\nI don't know why,\nit just doesn't work here.\n\n302\n00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.430\nSo for us,\nif we wanna do something like that,\n\n303\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.970\nwe'd really have to kind of bump\nup this one to another number.\n\n304\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:44.630\nAnd then add something in between ten and\nwhatever number that we give.\n\n305\n00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.080\nSo, for one reason or another,\nthat's what has to happen.\n\n306\n00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.179\nAnd so, now that we can take\nthe note of every entry that we see,\n\n307\n00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:51.476\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n308\n00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:57.373\nOkay, that also means we are now ready\nto also apply this to an interface.\n\n309\n00:17:57.373 --> 00:18:01.941\nWe're going to apply this\nto gigabitethernet 0/0,\n\n310\n00:18:01.941 --> 00:18:04.964\nlet's go back to our global config.\n\n311\n00:18:04.964 --> 00:18:11.115\nAnd now as I'm inside of\nglobal configuration,\n\n312\n00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:15.922\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0.\n\n313\n00:18:15.922 --> 00:18:20.740\nI can now add in ip access-group\nis what I want, and\n\n314\n00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:27.000\nthen 110, and this time,\nit's gonna be inbound, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.620\nSo that way,\n\n316\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.350\nwe're actually stopping it as close to the\nsource as possible is what we want to do.\n\n317\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.707\nSo now that I've got that set up and\ninside of there, let's go ahead and\n\n318\n00:18:37.707 --> 00:18:38.716\ntest this one out.\n\n319\n00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.630\nAnd then we'll come back and confirm,\n\n320\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.650\ndid any of this actually make\na difference in what we wanna do?\n\n321\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.992\nSo over here on our lab machine\nthat we have access to,\n\n322\n00:18:47.992 --> 00:18:53.700\nlet's go ahead and try and\nping that practice lab environment again.\n\n323\n00:18:56.627 --> 00:19:02.957\nLet me clear this off here and\nget that back up at the top,\n\n324\n00:19:02.957 --> 00:19:07.579\nwe'll do www.practice-labs.com.\n\n325\n00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:12.660\nAnd we'll just give it a moment and\nsee if we can gain access in.\n\n326\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.710\nAll right, now in theory,\n\n327\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:21.940\nif that list works, this shouldn't be\nworking because ping Is part of ICMP,\n\n328\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.360\nwhich we denied, all right,\nso that should not work.\n\n329\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.180\nNow, once it times out here,\nthat's what I was waiting for.\n\n330\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.155\nWhat if I try on a different\nprotocol like FTP instead,\n\n331\n00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:42.730\nwww.practice-labs.com.\n\n332\n00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.330\nThen I press Enter,\nnow notice what it says,\n\n333\n00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.860\nZach, right here it says connected, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.860\nSo we now see that FTP worked,\nbut pings didn't.\n\n335\n00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.810\nSo I'm actually having a very good\nfeeling that this access control list\n\n336\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.480\ndid do what it's supposed to do.\n\n337\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.670\nAnd let's verify that this actually\ndid get configured properly here.\n\n338\n00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.141\nAnd let me see if we can type an exit,\nshow access,\n\n339\n00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:14.780\nactually, this is gonna be show\naccess ip access lists, I think.\n\n340\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.412\nMake sure I'm telling you right here,\nnope, just access-lists, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:19.412 --> 00:20:21.407\nShow access, sometimes I forget,\n\n342\n00:20:21.407 --> 00:20:24.860\nthere's a couple of different\nthings I always forget here.\n\n343\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:32.290\nAccess-lists, which spelling apparently\nis one of them, and there we go.\n\n344\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.058\nYou can now see very clearly, okay,\n\n345\n00:20:35.058 --> 00:20:40.341\nthat it did end up having three\nmatches here, which is what we wanted.\n\n346\n00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:44.301\nSo notice that that's for FTP,\nwe didn't get any data sent across, so\n\n347\n00:20:44.301 --> 00:20:46.130\nthat's not anything.\n\n348\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.870\nBut notice it did also trigger\nthe deny here in four matches,\n\n349\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.080\njust we sent those four pings, and\nthat actually sent it back to us.\n\n350\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.326\nSo that's what we also end\nup seeing as well, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:56.326 --> 00:21:00.236\nSo this access-lists is extended\naccess list, did work very well for\n\n352\n00:21:00.236 --> 00:21:02.101\nwhat we actually wanted it to do.\n\n353\n00:21:02.101 --> 00:21:07.349\nOkay, so in that, right, we now have\nthe idea of understanding the way that\n\n354\n00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:12.843\nthese standard access control lists work,\nwhere it only depends on source IP.\n\n355\n00:21:12.843 --> 00:21:17.532\nExtended, again, source and destination\nas well as the protocol is the key to\n\n356\n00:21:17.532 --> 00:21:19.958\nunderstanding this one as well, okay?\n\n357\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:23.915\nNow we still got a little bit more to go,\nbut Zach, I've gone way over time here.\n\n358\n00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:24.511\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:26.723\n&gt;&gt; We'll do a small part four,\n\n360\n00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:29.954\nas we'll do, and we'll finish this up.\n\n361\n00:21:29.954 --> 00:21:32.450\nBut overall, though,\nthat's kind of the meat of it.\n\n362\n00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.060\nBut we still need named access list, cuz\nthat's probably what you'll also see is\n\n363\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.700\nprevalent in a lot of\ncompanies today as well.\n\n364\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're doing a wonderful job,\n\n365\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.095\nRonnie, configure standard access\nlist part four coming your way.\n\n366\n00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:46.095\nMake sure you see every single part,\nand before we move on, Ronnie,\n\n367\n00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:48.280\nI think you'd like to say something.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n368\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.050\njust remember, practice is the key, make\nsure you go through this lab step by step.\n\n369\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.500\nAnd before you move on to the next\nthing that you're entering in,\n\n370\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.900\nmake sure you understand\nwhat it is you're typing in.\n\n371\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.397\nIt doesn't help if you're\njust typing it in,\n\n372\n00:22:00.397 --> 00:22:03.095\nyou've got to know what\neach statement is about.\n\n373\n00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:06.663\nBecause that's what's gonna help you in\nunderstanding both standard as well as\n\n374\n00:22:06.663 --> 00:22:08.683\nextended access lists.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, and\n\n375\n00:22:08.683 --> 00:22:13.520\nmake sure you see every episode of Cisco\nCCENT that Ronnie's put together for you.\n\n376\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.940\nIt's gonna help you big time,\nand you'll be glad you did.\n\n377\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.230\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\n\n378\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.130\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\nthat are there to help you go further.\n\n379\n00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.603\nCheck them out, and\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV,\n\n380\n00:22:25.603 --> 00:22:27.111\nITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n381\n00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:29.401\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n382\n00:22:29.401 --> 00:22:31.839\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n383\n00:22:31.839 --> 00:22:37.774\n[MUSIC]\n\n384\n00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:41.400\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.223\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:13.130\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.480\njoining us here at IT Pro TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.390\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco CSAT.\n\n7\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.205\nThis is configure standard access list,\npart four.\n\n8\n00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:25.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:26.140\n&gt;&gt; And the person\n\n10\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.405\nwho's gonna help us with that,\nis of course Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.930\nRonnie, great to have you here and\nthanks for doing this.\n\n12\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Zack for\n\n13\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.740\njoining me in this little\nepic mini marathon that we\n\n14\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.875\nare doing.\n&gt;&gt; It's epic.\n\n15\n00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:39.425\nThe idea of different access list, right?\n\n16\n00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:43.315\nI just got lazy in the naming\nconvention here, but it is about,\n\n17\n00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:45.215\nof course, access control list.\n\n18\n00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.675\nAnd officially on the exam, I know you've\nprobably heard me say it if you've been\n\n19\n00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:52.315\nwatching the series through over and\nover again, but they really do only\n\n20\n00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:57.175\nemphasize standard access control lists,\nat least on the exam objectives.\n\n21\n00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:02.790\nBut I can't tell you, that they only\nlimit themselves to showing you that.\n\n22\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.180\nSo instead we're showing\nyou the whole gamut.\n\n23\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.500\nNow, we're not explaining\neverything in the utmost detail.\n\n24\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.900\nWe're showing you bits and pieces of it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.381\nAnd we spend a little bit more time,\nof course, on the standard one and\n\n26\n00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:13.449\non the extended one.\n\n27\n00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:16.490\nHere we are now going into\nnamed access control lists.\n\n28\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.110\nNow, we're starting to see more and\n\n29\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.840\nmore popularity with the named\naccess control list.\n\n30\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.110\nAnd the reason why is that\nthere is a lot less redundancy\n\n31\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.480\nwhen working with the named\naccess controller list, but\n\n32\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.840\nalso we're not limited by numbers anymore,\nright.\n\n33\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.530\nSo, inside that number group, right,\nstandard access controller list,\n\n34\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.900\nwe have 1 through 99,\nokay essentially is what we have.\n\n35\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.830\nAnd then once you do that,\nthen you can jump up to 1300 through 1999,\n\n36\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.900\nso another 700 or 699 in it, okay.\n\n37\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.890\nAnd then with the extended\naccess controller list,\n\n38\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.380\nyou go from 100 through 199.\n\n39\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.560\nAnd then you jump up there from 2000,\nI think, to 2699.\n\n40\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.770\nSo they've actually kind of added\nin additional ones that they have\n\n41\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.040\nout there, okay.\n\n42\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.600\nSo on these,\nyou do still see a lot of them.\n\n43\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.030\nThat's because that was\ntheir limitation and\n\n44\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.520\nwhat they had to do in the earliest\ndays of the IOS and how they did this.\n\n45\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.510\nNow there's a problem with them though,\ntoo, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.050\nIn these types of numbered access control\nlists that we have, as you started\n\n47\n00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.840\nbuilding them for your routers and for\nyour networks, they got pretty long.\n\n48\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.880\nAnd there's also something else\nthat was problematic, as well.\n\n49\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.240\nIt wasn't easy to remove a single entry\nin those lists or to reconfigure them.\n\n50\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.970\nIt was a lot more difficult\nto reconfigure them.\n\n51\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.890\nA lot of times, if you had this, you had\nto actually show like every single one,\n\n52\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.940\nby doing a show access list,\ngetting every single one out of there, and\n\n53\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.690\nthen you could modify what you wanted, and\n\n54\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.350\nthen you'd have to paste the whole\nthing back into the router to do so.\n\n55\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.250\nSo if you ended up messing up something,\n\n56\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.670\nit actually did take you quite a while\nto find all of the information that was\n\n57\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.400\non that particular device.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n58\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.880\n&gt;&gt; And to find the right, you know,\n\n59\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.210\nentry that you had in there.\n\n60\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.195\nAnd the reason why that sheet was kinda,\nagain, hard at even stuff like this,\n\n61\n00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:07.340\nright, is because when you start doing\nthat, remember, we want the most specific\n\n62\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.910\naccess list to be all the way at the top\nof the list, going to the most generic\n\n63\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.330\nparts of the access control list,\nall the way at the bottom.\n\n64\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.280\nSo you have, let's just say,\nthe idea of 50 or 60.\n\n65\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.490\nIt adds up very quickly.\n\n66\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.426\nIf you have hundreds of lines it adds up.\n\n67\n00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:26.120\nAll of a sudden, you start adding in\nanother couple of hundred, it starts to\n\n68\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.040\nget mind numbing and your eyes start\nto cross when you try and figure out\n\n69\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.540\nwhich one of these is actually overruling\nwhat you actually thought was set up.\n\n70\n00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.300\nSo instead, what they did is they said,\nlook, let's get away from this idea of\n\n71\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.580\nthe numbering and lets go to the named\naccess control list as well.\n\n72\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.030\nSo the great thing about it is, instead of\nhaving to type in multiple entries like\n\n73\n00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.450\nwhat you saw us do in the extended, and\neven in the standard access control list,\n\n74\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.580\nwhere we did like access-list 110, and\nthen we created a permit statement.\n\n75\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.620\nWe did the same thing two or three times.\n\n76\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.520\nAnd just creating those three\ndifferent statements, well, here,\n\n77\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.660\nwe can create one named\naccess control list.\n\n78\n00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.530\nAnd then we can add in just specifically\nthe entries that we want to\n\n79\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.990\nunderneath that one.\n\n80\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.630\nAnd so you will see this,\nand again, like I said,\n\n81\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.070\nI'm not gonna tell you it's\nthe most popular thing.\n\n82\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.870\nLike everything else, whoever\nthe networking professional you're working\n\n83\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.410\nwith, they tend to stick\nwith what they know best.\n\n84\n00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.540\nAnd if you grew up with the numbered\naccess list, it's easier to remember to do\n\n85\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.080\nthat rather then to go, let's change this\nnamed access list than to do other things.\n\n86\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.710\nBut this is part of what you may end up\nseeing, so we want to make sure that you\n\n87\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.070\nat least have a cursory understanding of\nusing these named access control lists.\n\n88\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.400\nThe great thing is,\nif you've been watching these episodes,\n\n89\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.380\nright, you already have a basic\nunderstanding on the functionality, so\n\n90\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.980\nwe don't have to go\nthrough all that again.\n\n91\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.660\nWe just need to concentrate\nin on the configuration\n\n92\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.640\nof this idea of the named\naccess control list.\n\n93\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.010\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n94\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.650\nMy machine just about went to sleep here.\n\n95\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.600\nLet's get back in here.\n\n96\n00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.760\nI'm gonna use gonna use NYEdge1,\nto do this.\n\n97\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.540\nNow, there was something\nI actually forgot.\n\n98\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.170\nAt the very beginning of this\nentire mini-series here,\n\n99\n00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.940\nI didn't show you the name of the lab\nthat we're actually working on.\n\n100\n00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.140\nStrange, I normally do this.\n\n101\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.330\nBut, Configure and\nVerify Standard Access Control Lists.\n\n102\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.380\nThis also comes underneath that as well,\nand you'll see that.\n\n103\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.716\nIt's right here, it's configuring access\nlists to restrict remote entry and\n\n104\n00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:17.500\nnamed list here.\n\n105\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.740\nSo we've got a couple of them\nthat we're gonna try and\n\n106\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.200\ncover in this one episode as well.\n\n107\n00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.000\nI'm gonna use NYEDGE1 to get us started.\n\n108\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.070\nSo let's go ahead and get access in.\n\n109\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.480\nSo from the user mode here, I want to\nmake sure that I gain in to privilege\n\n110\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.172\nexempt mode, so enable, and then into\nour global configuration mode as well.\n\n111\n00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:43.950\nAll right, once inside of global\nconfiguration mode, when we want\n\n112\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.690\nto configure a named one, this is\nwhere the syntax change is different.\n\n113\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.380\nLet me zoom in a little bit more so\nthat we can see that.\n\n114\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.510\nSo everything else that we've been doing,\nright, in standard and\n\n115\n00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.000\nin the extent that we started\noff with access dash list.\n\n116\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.300\nWell, with named ones, you start off\nwith IP Access dash list instead, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.430\nSo now that I have that, then I decide\nwhich one it's going to be, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.385\nSo notice that really for us,\nit's really the first and\n\n119\n00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:18.640\nthe last entry that we're really\ntaking look at right now.\n\n120\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.850\nWe're deciding right here whether it's\ngonna be an extended access controller or\n\n121\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.030\nwhether it's actually going to be\na standard access control list that will\n\n122\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.980\nbe named.\n\n123\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.020\nFor us,\nwe are going to do an extended one.\n\n124\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.370\nSo extended,\nIP access dash list and extended.\n\n125\n00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.860\nThen from that point, I can give it\na name or I can even give it a number.\n\n126\n00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.130\nNotice that even though, they'd say look,\nwe really want you to name this,\n\n127\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.700\nwe'll allow you to use\nnumbers if you want to.\n\n128\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.110\nCuz they actually consider the idea\nof a number as a name anyways, so\n\n129\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.070\nit does give you that\nparticular range as well, okay.\n\n130\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.592\nSo 1 through 99 or\n2000 though 2699 as well, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:57.592 --> 00:07:02.490\nSo both of those are possible,\nwe are actually going\n\n132\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.040\nto create kind of the same list that\nwe just did with the extend one, but\n\n133\n00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.510\nthis time,\nusing the name to show you the comparison.\n\n134\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.210\nSo in the previous one, we allowed for FTP\nto come through, but we denied ICMP, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.910\nSo that's what we did.\n\n136\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.833\nSo this time, let me paste this so\nyou don't have to watch me\n\n137\n00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:21.230\ntype cuz that's terrible to watch me type.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.161\n&gt;&gt; And we'll actually do a permit here,\n\n139\n00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:25.540\ndash ftp, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.390\nSo let me press enter there.\n\n141\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.660\nAnd now notice, it brings us directly\ninto a mode we haven't yet seen,\n\n142\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.170\nwhich is Configure Extended\nNetwork Access Control List or\n\n143\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.988\nNACL, right, the configure this list here.\n\n144\n00:07:41.988 --> 00:07:46.214\nBut this prompt lets you know right away,\nthat you're actually in this, I'm saying\n\n145\n00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:50.627\nnumbered, there should be named access\ncontroller list, not numbered, NACL, okay.\n\n146\n00:07:50.627 --> 00:07:55.600\nSo that's me messing up on my speech here,\nall right.\n\n147\n00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.538\nOnce we have this, now we can just\nconfigure the entries that we want.\n\n148\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:03.224\nOkay, so let's start off here\nby saying we want to permit,\n\n149\n00:08:03.224 --> 00:08:07.159\nthen we're going to choose\nthe protocol like we did last time.\n\n150\n00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:11.760\nSo for us, usually it's tcp, or\nudp, or ip, ip is everything.\n\n151\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.409\nBut we're going to do tcp\nlike we did last time,\n\n152\n00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:20.072\nthen we're going to do host 192.168.16.10.\n\n153\n00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:24.850\nRemember that word host is an alias for,\nmatch every single bit here.\n\n154\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.685\nSo we're only doing this one,\nand we're going to do host\n\n155\n00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:34.637\n172.15.0.10, and this time equals, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:34.637 --> 00:08:36.995\nAnd then we're going to select ftp.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n157\n00:08:39.314 --> 00:08:41.380\n&gt;&gt; And press enter, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.689\nSo that accepts it, now take a look, Zach,\nlook at that, the dollar sign actually\n\n159\n00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:47.960\nappeared here once again.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it did.\n\n160\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.953\n&gt;&gt; And that dollar sign,\n\n161\n00:08:48.953 --> 00:08:51.885\nremember that if you,\nhopefully you'll remember this, right?\n\n162\n00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:55.641\nAs you see something like this happening,\nit's not that's it's doing,\n\n163\n00:08:55.641 --> 00:08:57.900\nadding in any additional symbols.\n\n164\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.809\nWhat it's telling you is that this line\nis too long to display on the screen, so\n\n165\n00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:04.427\nthat's what it's actually letting you do,\nokay?\n\n166\n00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:08.530\nSo it's saying, hey, this is way too long\nto display on this particular screen.\n\n167\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.851\nSo take a note of it,\nthat there's something else behind here.\n\n168\n00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:16.082\nOn a real router interface, all you'd have\nto do is click on that line if you have\n\n169\n00:09:16.082 --> 00:09:18.560\na mouse, or you, yeah, that's what you do.\n\n170\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.372\nAnd then you can use your left arrow,\n\n171\n00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:23.253\nand that will actually show\nyou the entire front end line.\n\n172\n00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:26.616\nYou go to your right arrow,\nit actually should scroll to the left and\n\n173\n00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:29.840\nactually show you the rest of\nthe line as you pull it in.\n\n174\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.060\nSo you have that ability to do so.\n\n175\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.180\nIn my interface that I have right here,\nwhere it says type commands.\n\n176\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.198\nThat's not officially a part of the\ninterface so they're actually doing that.\n\n177\n00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:41.759\nAll right,\nnow the other thing that I want here is,\n\n178\n00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:44.270\nwe're going to actually\nissue a deny statement.\n\n179\n00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.406\nSo we're going to leave out\nthe ftp data statement here,\n\n180\n00:09:49.406 --> 00:09:56.158\nwe're just going to do deny\nicmp then host 192.168.16.10.\n\n181\n00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:59.360\nAnd this one we're actually\ndenying it to go any place.\n\n182\n00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:06.803\nSo just in the same manner,\nwhere we were able to combine permits and\n\n183\n00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:08.440\ndenys in one statement.\n\n184\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.601\nNow notice that with three short lines,\nwe almost equivalently did the same\n\n185\n00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:16.250\nthing that we did with\nthe extended access controllers.\n\n186\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.190\nLet me get out of this, and let's type in,\n\n187\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.623\nshow ip access-lists here,\n\n188\n00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:30.134\nthen it's going to be the name,\npermit-ftp.\n\n189\n00:10:30.134 --> 00:10:34.881\nAnd now we can see the two entries\nthat we've created here with\n\n190\n00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.270\nour named access list, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.952\nSo once you start seeing that, and note\nthe numbers, again, in between, right?\n\n192\n00:10:41.952 --> 00:10:44.174\nWe have an additional number in between,\n\n193\n00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:48.880\nthat if we need to insert something in\nbetween, we have the ability to do so.\n\n194\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.309\nSo you remember what we're missing, right?\n\n195\n00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:54.809\nSo ftp works on two different ports,\nso I'd left off that second one to\n\n196\n00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:58.488\nshow you that you could add\nsomething in between, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:58.488 --> 00:11:03.090\nAnd so what I want to do is I want to\nadd in that ftp data, and when I do so,\n\n198\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.228\nI want to put it in between 10 and\n20, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:09.810\nSo I'm going to choose, of course,\nthe number 15 to help us out here.\n\n200\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.045\nSo the way that I do that is I\nget into the modification here,\n\n201\n00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:16.373\nso I need to go back into our\nglobal configuration terminal.\n\n202\n00:11:16.373 --> 00:11:19.308\nAnd once I'm in here,\n\n203\n00:11:19.308 --> 00:11:24.869\nthen I can go to ip access-list extended,\n\n204\n00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:31.252\nand this is going to be permit-ftp.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n205\n00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:34.112\n&gt;&gt; And now that I'm back inside of\n\n206\n00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:36.429\nthat permit-ftp list.\n\n207\n00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:41.741\nBecause here, I can add in 15 permit\n\n208\n00:11:41.741 --> 00:11:47.220\ntcp host 192.168.16.10\n\n209\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.201\nto host 172.15.0.10 as\n\n210\n00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:57.519\nwell equal to ftp-data, all right?\n\n211\n00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:01.828\nSo once again, the line is too long,\n\n212\n00:12:01.828 --> 00:12:08.505\nlet's get back out here and\ndo our show ip access-list.\n\n213\n00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:18.319\nPermit-ftp, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:22.655\nNow when I do so, the neat, I tried this\nbecause I wanted to see something that\n\n215\n00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:24.750\nwould end up happening here, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.322\nSomewhere along the line, I can't remember\nwhether it's actually a singular,\n\n217\n00:12:30.322 --> 00:12:32.322\nbecause I've typed them in both ways now.\n\n218\n00:12:32.322 --> 00:12:37.240\nSo before, I typed in,\nshow ip access-list.\n\n219\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n220\n00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.218\n&gt;&gt; No, I actually did type it in\n\n221\n00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:41.200\nthe same way, so it actually is plural.\n\n222\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.975\nI was, I don't know why, in my mind,\nit's either access-list or list, so\n\n223\n00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:48.072\nI wanted to try and see if I actually\nput a syntax error in there.\n\n224\n00:12:48.072 --> 00:12:50.980\nSo either way, but\nat this point here, right,\n\n225\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.214\nmake sure you realize that this is\nplural and not just access-list.\n\n226\n00:12:55.214 --> 00:12:58.743\nNow we don't think about it, and you I\nprobably would never think about it again,\n\n227\n00:12:58.743 --> 00:13:01.050\nexcept for\nthose that are ready for the exam.\n\n228\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.160\nThat's enough to get\nsomething wrong on the exam.\n\n229\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.006\nI know that it seems strange, but\nsyntax errors are, again, wrong, so\n\n230\n00:13:08.006 --> 00:13:10.450\nmake sure that you see that.\n\n231\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.760\nNow notice that as I added that in,\nit did insert in that 15 in between, which\n\n232\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.671\nis what we wanted to be able to do, okay?\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n233\n00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:21.193\nright.\n&gt;&gt; So now that's actually in the proper\n\n234\n00:13:21.193 --> 00:13:24.989\norder of things when we do this, okay,\njust like everything else, right?\n\n235\n00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:27.750\nEven though I have an access\nlist configured, at this point,\n\n236\n00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.410\nit's not doing anything.\n\n237\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.747\nSo I need to go ahead and\nadd this into an interface, too.\n\n238\n00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:35.090\nSo let's do a configure terminal, and\n\n239\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.290\nthen we're going to add\nthis into gigabitethernet.\n\n240\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:49.595\nIf I spelled ethernet right, ethernet 0/0,\n\n241\n00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:54.466\nand now I do, ip access-group, and\n\n242\n00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.938\nI simply type in the name.\n\n243\n00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:02.520\nPermit-ftp, and\nthen tell it the direction, inbound.\n\n244\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.468\nSo instead of actually typing in the list\nnumber, now notice it actually says to go\n\n245\n00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:10.999\nahead and type that in,\nwe're perfectly fine with that.\n\n246\n00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:16.250\nAnd now let's verify using, of course,\nour lab environment one more time here.\n\n247\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.563\nSo previously,\nfrom the previous configuration,\n\n248\n00:14:18.563 --> 00:14:19.882\nwhere we did the access list.\n\n249\n00:14:19.882 --> 00:14:23.501\nI went ahead and\nremoved that from gigabitethernet 0/0, and\n\n250\n00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:26.455\nnow we should only have this\none access list on here.\n\n251\n00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:29.197\nOkay, so from here, oops, let me see,\n\n252\n00:14:29.197 --> 00:14:32.853\nthat should have actually\ngotten out of that, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:35.770\nSo, from here, let's see,\nwhat are we going to do?\n\n254\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.410\nWe are going to ping once again,\nlet me try it here.\n\n255\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.803\nSo this time,it tells me I need to ping\nby key address instead of the name.\n\n256\n00:14:44.803 --> 00:14:48.515\nLet's try 172.15.0.10,\n\n257\n00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:53.640\nand we'll see if this\nactually does work for us.\n\n258\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.749\nWell, if we remember on the named\naccess list, we, again, denied what?\n\n259\n00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:59.835\nICMP, which ping is a part of here, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:02.766\nIf you want to know which\none actually is ping,\n\n261\n00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:06.060\nping is actually one called echo-reply.\n\n262\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.990\nSpecifically, that one protocol\nthat you do end up seeing, so\n\n263\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.306\nit actually didn't work,\nas far as you and I know, so that's fine.\n\n264\n00:15:14.306 --> 00:15:19.970\nLet me clear that out so that we can\nget access back up here to the top.\n\n265\n00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.778\nNow, we're going to do ftp again,\n172.15.0.10,\n\n266\n00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:27.454\nlet's see if we can get connected.\n\n267\n00:15:27.454 --> 00:15:30.300\nOnce again,\nnotice it now says it's connected here.\n\n268\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.655\nThis time, of course, using the IP address\ninstead of the name as well, all right?\n\n269\n00:15:34.655 --> 00:15:37.892\nSo everything looks like it's\nworking according to the same thing.\n\n270\n00:15:37.892 --> 00:15:40.490\nWe essentially just duplicated\nthe effort that we made\n\n271\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.299\nin the extended access control list.\n\n272\n00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:46.880\nAnd showed it right here in the named\naccess control list as well.\n\n273\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.487\nNow back over on NYEDGE1, okay,\nwhat can we do to verify,\n\n274\n00:15:51.487 --> 00:15:55.095\nonce again,\nif we have the lists that we want?\n\n275\n00:15:55.095 --> 00:16:01.070\nLet's do a show ip access-list\n\n276\n00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:05.282\nHere, permit-ftp.\n\n277\n00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:09.096\nAnd now notice we have the matches,\nlet me zoom that up there, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:12.957\nSo we have those matches that shows us\nthat the list is working the way that we\n\n279\n00:16:12.957 --> 00:16:13.459\nwant to.\n\n280\n00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:15.707\nBut if I am not sure about this, right,\n\n281\n00:16:15.707 --> 00:16:19.600\nhow do I know that that's not\nold data that's left behind?\n\n282\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:27.478\nI can always run a clear ip\naccess-list here counters.\n\n283\n00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:32.342\nSo essentially telling it to\n\n284\n00:16:32.342 --> 00:16:37.613\nremove those counters here and\n\n285\n00:16:37.613 --> 00:16:44.730\nthen show ip access-list permit-ftp.\n\n286\n00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.844\nLet me do this again here, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:46.844 --> 00:16:49.760\nNow notice that those\nnumbers have disappeared.\n\n288\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.995\nThen I can run my test again.\n\n289\n00:16:51.995 --> 00:16:56.040\nAnd if they match again, well, then you\ncan actually see what ends up happening.\n\n290\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.866\nBut that's something that you can do and\n\n291\n00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:01.640\nto verify that everything is actually\nrunning the way that you want to.\n\n292\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.620\nOne last thing that I wanna show you\nbefore we move on to our second part here,\n\n293\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:11.600\nwhich is what we also need to do, okay,\nis to do a show running-config here.\n\n294\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.750\nAnd let's take a look at the way that\nit shows up in the running config as\n\n295\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.440\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.390\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just using now the space bar to\n\n297\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.190\nhelp us get through.\n\n298\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:25.000\nAnd this is where you wanna verify that\nyou have this, first of all, of course,\n\n299\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.585\nright, the proper access list\non the proper interface and\n\n300\n00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:30.980\nit's in the right direction, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.070\nThat's key when you do this.\n\n302\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.320\nIf you don't, well, it's not gonna work.\n\n303\n00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.280\nThen, as we scroll down the page, here is\nalso what we're looking for too, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.270\nIt doesn't matter that there's\nthe other access list here.\n\n305\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.420\nNow don't get me wrong, if you start\nfilling it up, you start filling it up.\n\n306\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.200\nBut it doesn't matter that this tiny two\ndifferent access lists that I created,\n\n307\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.708\nit's not gonna hurt this router any.\n\n308\n00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:58.416\nBut what you're just trying to verify,\nis this the statement that you want?\n\n309\n00:17:58.416 --> 00:18:03.800\nAnd also remember the order of\nprocessing listed here too, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.286\nIf you end up seeing where something\nelse is getting denied and\n\n311\n00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:11.911\nyou don't expect it to be getting denied,\nremember to check for the idea that did I\n\n312\n00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:15.620\nactually meet the requirement or\ndid it actually meet that idea?\n\n313\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.470\nThe implicit deny statement that\nis at the end of all these lists.\n\n314\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.220\nNow how do you know if this\nis actually getting denied or\n\n315\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.370\nnot if it's implicit and it's in there?\n\n316\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.860\nYou can actually even type in another\none at the end that says, go ahead and\n\n317\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.320\ndo the access-list 110 deny\nany to any if you want to.\n\n318\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.660\nAnd then put the word log at the end.\n\n319\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.210\nAnd that way you can verify if\nit's actually denying something.\n\n320\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.350\nNow normally, if you actually\nturn on logging for anything,\n\n321\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.320\nthat's probably the one you wanna\nturn on logging for permanently.\n\n322\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.070\nAnd on the other ones,\n\n323\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.860\nyou may wanna turn off logging after\nyou actually test if it's working.\n\n324\n00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.760\nThe reason why you wanna do that now is\nyou wanna see who is trying to get access\n\n325\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.040\nto something else.\n\n326\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.310\nSo in that sense, it can do that.\n\n327\n00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.770\nSo be careful about just leaving\nthose logging on, right?\n\n328\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.210\nOr actually I think I'm\ntelling you backwards.\n\n329\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.323\nYou normally don't wanna actually\nsee all the deny any anys.\n\n330\n00:19:10.323 --> 00:19:13.431\nCuz that's usually the one that\nends up getting blocked the most,\n\n331\n00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:15.380\nif they're not actually doing it right.\n\n332\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.850\nAnd so don't do that,\nbecause that can fill up very quickly.\n\n333\n00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:24.700\nSo it's just me getting my words backwards\nis what ends up happening, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.162\nSo those are usually the two\nconfigurations that we want to\n\n335\n00:19:27.162 --> 00:19:27.720\nsee as well.\n\n336\n00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.500\nSo don't forget directionality and\nthe interface.\n\n337\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.364\nThat's key.\n\n338\n00:19:32.364 --> 00:19:35.001\nMaking sure that your\nlists as you do this and\n\n339\n00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:38.970\nthat they're in the proper order\nis also key as well, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.312\nSo check those out too and don't forget\nabout wildcard mask as well, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:43.312 --> 00:19:46.471\nAll right, so\nwe've got one more to show you here, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:51.054\nAnd that is because this is part of\na device configuration that you may end up\n\n343\n00:19:51.054 --> 00:19:55.810\nactually having to see here, which is\nto restrict the idea of remote access.\n\n344\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.200\nAnd we're gonna use NYEDGE2, to help us\nout, now that we've rurally configured\n\n345\n00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.210\nNYEDGE1 with a lot of different access\ncontrol lists that we can't do here.\n\n346\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.903\nSo over on NYEDGE1,\nif I can get access in here,\n\n347\n00:20:10.903 --> 00:20:15.620\nthat's the key, is what we want to do.\n\n348\n00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.447\nAll right, so let's go ahead and configure\nthis router here for remote access and\n\n349\n00:20:19.447 --> 00:20:23.345\nthen we'll set an access control list to\nlimit the access is what we'll do, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:26.846\nSo let's go into our\nprivilege exempt mode and\n\n351\n00:20:26.846 --> 00:20:32.070\nthen directly into our, well,\nglobal configuration mode, okay?\n\n352\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:38.392\nLet me see if I can zoom in just a little\nbit more to make that readable, or\n\n353\n00:20:38.392 --> 00:20:39.650\nlegible, here.\n\n354\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.982\nThere we go, that looks,\nwell, hopefully better, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:41.982 --> 00:20:44.998\nAll right, so\nnow that we can actually see that here,\n\n356\n00:20:44.998 --> 00:20:47.890\nI wanted to set up the virtual\naccess line, right?\n\n357\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.460\nSo people that will connect\nfrom across the network here.\n\n358\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:57.377\nSo I'm gonna do line vty 0 15\nis what we're going to do here.\n\n359\n00:20:57.377 --> 00:21:00.762\nNow the reason why is that this is\nactually a layer 3 switch is what we're\n\n360\n00:21:00.762 --> 00:21:01.780\nactually on.\n\n361\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.283\nEven though we've been using it as a\nrouter most of the time it handles most of\n\n362\n00:21:05.283 --> 00:21:08.046\nthose commands, so\nthat's why cuz there are 16 of them.\n\n363\n00:21:08.046 --> 00:21:11.610\nOn a standard router, remember\nthere's actually zero through five, or\n\n364\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.456\nfour is the one that we normally have.\n\n365\n00:21:13.456 --> 00:21:17.560\nThen we're gonna set a password to gain\naccess in, which is gonna be password.\n\n366\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.420\nIt's gonna be cisco is the password\nthat we're going to set on accessing.\n\n367\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.740\nAnd then, of course, we wanna tell them\nthat they're gonna be able to log in.\n\n368\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.000\nSo we've done this in a previous\nepisode where we set up initial device\n\n369\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.120\nconfiguration for remote access.\n\n370\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.380\nSo we're essentially doing the same thing.\n\n371\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.400\nThis time, though, we're also\ngoing to limit the access instead\n\n372\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.310\nby doing a named access control list.\n\n373\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.760\nSo we're gonna do ip access-lists and\nthen standard and\n\n374\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.260\nthis time we're gonna say\npermit-remote is what we're gonna do.\n\n375\n00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.470\nSo this will allow us to go ahead and\nset this up so it's a named access list.\n\n376\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.060\nAnd we're not doing an extended one.\n\n377\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.779\nSo once we do that,\npermit host 192.168.16.10.\n\n378\n00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:10.730\nAnd once I do that, that's perfectly fine.\n\n379\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.014\nI want to make sure that I wanna see who\nends up trying gain access to this when\n\n380\n00:22:15.014 --> 00:22:16.107\nthey shouldn't.\n\n381\n00:22:16.107 --> 00:22:19.810\nSo I'm gonna do a deny any.\n\n382\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.590\nThen at the end,\nI'm gonna tell her to log it.\n\n383\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.516\nSo that way I can know who's\ntrying gain access in.\n\n384\n00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:28.328\nAnd it should reject them if\nthey're not from this host as well.\n\n385\n00:22:28.328 --> 00:22:31.651\nOne we do that, we're perfectly fine here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n386\n00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:34.564\n&gt;&gt; All right, now that we've got that and\n\n387\n00:22:34.564 --> 00:22:38.359\nwe've set that all up here,\nnow let's go ahead and\n\n388\n00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:41.810\nalso assign this into the access lines.\n\n389\n00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:48.139\nSo that means I have to do or\nline vty 0 space 15.\n\n390\n00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:54.060\nAnd remember that, that actually brings me\nto that same prompt that we did before,\n\n391\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.870\nwhich is config-line.\n\n392\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.590\nSo now I'm actually inside\nof these virtual interfaces,\n\n393\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.820\nis what you're seeing there, okay?\n\n394\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:06.676\nSo within that virtual interface, then I\nhave to assign the access control list.\n\n395\n00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:11.260\nJust like I did with the physical\ninterface here, we have to do this.\n\n396\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.277\nNow this is a little bit\nmore unusual because,\n\n397\n00:23:14.277 --> 00:23:20.110\ninstead of access-group on a virtual line,\nit's access-class,\n\n398\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.680\nso that's a good distinction to\nmake sure that you understand.\n\n399\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.250\nSo on physical interfaces, access-group.\n\n400\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.720\nOn a virtual interface,\nlike what we're doing, is access-class.\n\n401\n00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:38.340\nThen we give it the name,\npermit remote in, all right?\n\n402\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.675\nSo if you put an access-group here,\nit shouldn't work.\n\n403\n00:23:40.675 --> 00:23:43.440\nAccess-class is the only one that\nshould work here at this point.\n\n404\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.690\nAll right, so now that we've got that\nconfigured, that's all that it took.\n\n405\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.470\nAll we did was we added an access\nlist essentially into those\n\n406\n00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.140\nremote access connections\nthat we might have.\n\n407\n00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.502\nIf I go back over now to our\nmachine over here where we\n\n408\n00:23:59.502 --> 00:24:04.178\nhave our test lab Let's see\nwhat we can gain access to.\n\n409\n00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:07.300\nAnd there is a utility on\nhere that is called Putty.\n\n410\n00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.240\nLet's see if I can bring that up for us.\n\n411\n00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.410\nAnd we'll zoom in so that w can see it.\n\n412\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.220\nOkay, so Putty is a nice little tool that\nhelps me to be able to do what I need to.\n\n413\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.640\nSo what I want to is I want\nto do a telnet connection.\n\n414\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.920\nI'm gonna slug the radio button for\n\n415\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.078\nTelnet.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n416\n00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:26.420\n&gt;&gt; Then, 192.168, Oops.\n\n417\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.075\nToo many numbers.\n\n418\n00:24:27.075 --> 00:24:28.460\n192.168.\n168, I think I\n\n419\n00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.410\nactually hit four numbers at one time.\n\n420\n00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.592\nThat's quite unusual.\n\n421\n00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:37.910\n16.2, that was weird.\n\n422\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.170\nI've never seen that happen before.\n\n423\n00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.240\nSo let's see if I can gain access in.\n\n424\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:44.740\nI click Open.\n\n425\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.403\nNow notice, it looks like,\nhey, look at that.\n\n426\n00:24:49.403 --> 00:24:51.375\nIt says 16.2.\n\n427\n00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:54.460\nWell, let's try our password of Cisco.\n\n428\n00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.580\nAnd look at that, I am in NYEDGE2.\n\n429\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.400\nI know it's difficult to see,\nlet me see if I can show you that.\n\n430\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.600\nSo I am actually able to get access in.\n\n431\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.130\nNow, when I took a look that,\n\n432\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.938\nand what we actually did is that we're\nsupposed to only get access by how?\n\n433\n00:25:09.938 --> 00:25:14.382\nBy only that one host, right?\n&gt;&gt; But on this one,\n\n434\n00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:19.458\nokay, which is fine because\nthis is actually the host,\n\n435\n00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:23.025\nI am on 192.168.16.10.\n\n436\n00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:27.669\nAnd now, I'm able to gain access\nto NYEDGE2 using Telnet, okay,\n\n437\n00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:30.820\nwhich is what we want to be able to do.\n\n438\n00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.710\nSo that does tend to work and\ndo what we want to do, too.\n\n439\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.440\nSo go back over, and\nnow let's see what we can do from here.\n\n440\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.260\nSo if I go here, let's take a look and\nverify that list.\n\n441\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.034\nGet back here.\n\n442\n00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.045\nShow access-list.\n\n443\n00:25:53.462 --> 00:25:58.152\nNow we can see the matches that said yes,\nit did go through here, and\n\n444\n00:25:58.152 --> 00:26:00.050\nit did match up.\n\n445\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.881\nNow, let's try it from a different\ndevice that is not 16.10,\n\n446\n00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:08.076\nbut is actually 16.1.\n\n447\n00:26:08.076 --> 00:26:13.920\nSo on NYEDGE1, This is from 16.1 here.\n\n448\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.880\nLet's see if I can gain access in.\n\n449\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:23.937\nNow I can do Telnet, 192.168.16.2.\n\n450\n00:26:23.937 --> 00:26:24.665\nAnd now let's see.\n\n451\n00:26:24.665 --> 00:26:27.220\nNotice it says it's trying telnet here,\nokay?\n\n452\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.380\nSo its trying.\n\n453\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:28.950\nIt's trying.\n\n454\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:29.555\nIt's trying.\n\n455\n00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:34.320\nIt doesn't look like anything's actually\nending up happening here, but it is trying\n\n456\n00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.880\nto connect, but it's not allowing for\nthat connection to go through.\n\n457\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.694\nSo let's verify one more time that it's\nthe access list that is preventing this.\n\n458\n00:26:42.694 --> 00:26:48.829\nSo if we now run show access-list,\nall right?\n\n459\n00:26:48.829 --> 00:26:50.460\nSo hopefully that's\nactually the right one.\n\n460\n00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.160\nIt is, okay, NYEDGE2.\n\n461\n00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.470\nJust wanna make sure.\n\n462\n00:26:59.142 --> 00:27:00.412\nPress Enter.\n\n463\n00:27:03.094 --> 00:27:04.680\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n464\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.220\nWe can see that there it is.\n\n465\n00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.280\nIt ended up denying that access now.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n466\n00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.680\nwe can actually use the access control\nlist on whether it's a virtual interface\n\n467\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.190\nor whether its a physical\ninterface as well.\n\n468\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.640\nBut all three of these access lists\nthat we've been talking about,\n\n469\n00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.360\nwhether it's a standard access list,\nwhether it's an extended access list, or\n\n470\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.340\na named access list,\nI know that the focus is supposed to be on\n\n471\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.610\nstandard access lists on the CCENT exam.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n472\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.610\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time,\n\n473\n00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:37.740\nI can not guarantee you that you won't see\nthe other ones, at least if nothing else,\n\n474\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.750\nin comparison to the standard\naccess control list.\n\n475\n00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.510\nBut overall though, if you notice,\nthey all work just about the same way.\n\n476\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:50.030\nSo there is a lot of overlap in terms of\nthe conceptual understanding of them.\n\n477\n00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.980\nBut do make sure that you also know\nthe difference between them as well.\n\n478\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.700\nAnd the very end here,\n\n479\n00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.000\nthe big difference that we showed\nyou is applying it to the interface.\n\n480\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.740\nOn a physical interface, access-group.\n\n481\n00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.910\nOn a virtual interface,\nwhat we just did, right,\n\n482\n00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:09.455\nwhere you're connecting in from Telnet or\nsomething else, it's access-class.\n\n483\n00:28:09.455 --> 00:28:12.990\nSo you gotta make sure that you\nknow the differences there, too.\n\n484\n00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.730\nSo Zach, that actually does end our\nlittle roundabout mini-series here\n\n485\n00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.240\non configuring standard\naccess control list.\n\n486\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.310\nShould have just called this\nconfiguring access control list, but\n\n487\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.070\nthis is the way it's actually listed\non the exam, so we'll leave it at that.\n\n488\n00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.520\nSo Zach, that is our official end to\nour little mini-series here that we've\n\n489\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.930\njust gone through here in four episodes.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job, Ronnie.\n\n490\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.670\nConfiguring standard access lists,\nparts one through four!\n\n491\n00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.900\nMake sure you see every\nsingle one of those.\n\n492\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.830\nVery important.\n\n493\n00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.490\nAnd, Ronnie,\nwould you like to add something?\n\n494\n00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:44.505\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\n\n495\n00:28:44.505 --> 00:28:45.824\npractice is key, right?\n\n496\n00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:50.189\nThis is one of the more complex examples\nthat we have in terms of the configuration\n\n497\n00:28:50.189 --> 00:28:53.720\nbecause it requires you to\nunderstand each piece of it.\n\n498\n00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.590\nYou don't understand each piece of it,\nthat's when you get it wrong, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.740\nSo make sure you do this lab slowly.\n\n500\n00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.490\nAnd then make sure you understand\nit before you move on.\n\n501\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.290\nSo I don't suggest that you move\non to the next concept until you\n\n502\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.790\nunderstand this one.\n\n503\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.010\nI know that that may delay you a little\nbit, but it is worth your time and\n\n504\n00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.630\nyour effort to do so.\n\n505\n00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.170\nGreat advice and a great series.\n\n506\n00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.680\nMakes sure you watch every\nsingle episode of Cisco CCENT,\n\n507\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.030\nyou're gonna be very happy that you did.\n\n508\n00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.930\nAnd by the way, you'll be in the course\nlibrary where there's thousands of other\n\n509\n00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.470\nvideos that are there\nto help you go further.\n\n510\n00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.619\nCheck those out, too.\n\n511\n00:29:24.619 --> 00:29:27.560\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n512\n00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.470\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n513\n00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.150\nThanks for

00:00:12.945\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.010\nchoosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.770\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n6\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.040\nThis particular episode,\nwe're going to configure NAT.\n\n7\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.880\nWhat's that?\n\n8\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.360\nWell, let's find out, shall we?\n\n9\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.750\nAnd Ronnie Wong is here to tell us.\n\n10\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for\n\n11\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.200\nletting me back on the show as we continue\non in our CCENT journey together.\n\n12\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.150\nWe are now at that point where\nwe're gonna be configuring NAT,\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.370\nwhich is Network Address Translation.\n\n14\n00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.220\nNow, this is the technology,\nwe spoke about this during our networking\n\n15\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.430\nfundamentals, where we talked about,\nthere's three basic technologies\n\n16\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.660\nthat really help slow down the depletion\nof IP version four addressing\n\n17\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.860\nfrom really just disappearing\nquicker than they needed it to.\n\n18\n00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.770\nAnd the reason why this is\nimportant is because without it\n\n19\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.928\ntoday in the way that networking works,\n\n20\n00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:07.890\nit actually will not allow you to connect\nout to network directly anymore, since we\n\n21\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.352\nuse a combination of what we call private\nIP addresses and public IP addresses.\n\n22\n00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:18.050\nSo NAT, Network Address Translation,\nis one of those three technologies that\n\n23\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.330\nreally did help us to slow down the actual\ndepletion of those IP version four.\n\n24\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.240\nThat, along with variable link subnet\nmasking, is also what we also did here,\n\n25\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.540\ntoo, and of course,\nthe use of private IP addresses.\n\n26\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.796\nSo along with the idea of network address\ntranslations that allow us to take,\n\n27\n00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:42.760\nwell at least practically,\ntake private IP addresses and\n\n28\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.890\ntranslate them into public IP addresses.\n\n29\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.640\nUsing the router to help us to do that,\nit actually allows us to again,\n\n30\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.374\nbe able to get access to\nthe internet today, is what it does.\n\n31\n00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:56.091\n&gt;&gt; So we wouldn't use NAT or IPv6?.\n\n32\n00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.397\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there is a NAT if you need it, but\n\n33\n00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:02.160\nmost of the time in IPv6,\nyou're not gonna need it any more.\n\n34\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.110\nSo today, what ends up happening\nis that if you choose to\n\n35\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.170\nI think you can still do it but\nit's probably not recommended.\n\n36\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.760\nSo there's probably a configuration for\nit but the way that we tend to work with\n\n37\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.740\naddresses especially in this\nenvironment and IP version six,\n\n38\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.000\nyou're probably not gonna need\nto ever visit that at all.\n\n39\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.680\nSo one of the ideas behind IPv6 is you can\ndrop NAT and it doesn't bother it all.\n\n40\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.970\nBut since we're still in IPv4 and\nwe're preparing for\n\n41\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.890\nour CCENT exam-\n&gt;&gt; Right on.\n\n42\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.600\n&gt;&gt; We wanna make sure that we understand,\n\n43\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.090\nof course, the concept of\nnetwork address translation.\n\n44\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.500\nAnd of course, the idea here of that\nthere's several different things that we\n\n45\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.230\nhave to get done and\nthe configuration of it.\n\n46\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.940\nSo let me start by explaining\nthe idea of what NAT does for\n\n47\n00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.810\nus, which is using three\ndifferent methods.\n\n48\n00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.650\nAnd it again, happened along in\nthe development of the technology,\n\n49\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.250\nis what happened.\n\n50\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.430\nSo when we start to talk about it, there's\nthree main differences that we can do.\n\n51\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.910\nOne is what we call a static\nNAT translation, and\n\n52\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.740\nthat is a direct one to one translation.\n\n53\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.910\nThat means if I have\na single private IP address,\n\n54\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.620\nI can translate it into a single\npublic IP address in practicality.\n\n55\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.820\nNow do I have to always use public and\nprivate?\n\n56\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.650\nNo, you can actually translate\nprivate to private or\n\n57\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.620\npublic to public if you choose to.\n\n58\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.670\nIt depends on what you need, but\n\n59\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.140\nthe most practical example is private\nIP address to public IP address.\n\n60\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.060\nSo static NAT is available.\n\n61\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.250\nSo hold off, we’ll talk about\nwhy we would choose to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.750\nThen, there is also what’s\ncalled dynamic NAT.\n\n63\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.667\nDynamic NAT allows me to take all of\nthe addresses inside of my network that\n\n64\n00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:43.947\nI have available.\n\n65\n00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:48.905\nSo let's say, for an example, I have a\nclass C local area network, and if I do so\n\n66\n00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:51.370\nI have 254 addresses.\n\n67\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.303\nBut from the ISP, let's say I only\ngot four public IP addresses or so.\n\n68\n00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.892\nIf I only got four public IP addresses,\n\n69\n00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:04.057\nI can't get a translation to\nevery single one of those 254.\n\n70\n00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:08.791\nBut what I can create is a pool of\nthose four public IP addresses, and\n\n71\n00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:14.920\nthen have up to four connections going\nout through that router at any one time.\n\n72\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.840\nIf a fifth one comes along though,\none of those four has to drop.\n\n73\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.570\nIf it doesn't,\nthen they aren't gonna get a connection.\n\n74\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.394\nBut normally, and the most prevalent\none that is used today is what we call,\n\n75\n00:04:26.394 --> 00:04:31.270\nit's called NAT overload,\nit is technically Cisco, the way that we\n\n76\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.760\ncall it, but you'll hear it more commonly\ncalled PAT or Port Address Translation.\n\n77\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.230\nWhen we start doing something\nlike Port Address Translation,\n\n78\n00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.050\nthis allows me to take all the addresses\nthat I need internally and it attaches\n\n79\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.500\na port number to them, and then I can\noverload a single public IP address.\n\n80\n00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.872\nSo if I have 254 nodes,\nthey can exit out of my router interface.\n\n81\n00:04:56.872 --> 00:05:02.390\nAnd to the Internet, It just appears as\none IP address, is what is ends up doing.\n\n82\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.296\nSo all of that is possible and\nin today's world, if I know that my local\n\n83\n00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:11.789\narea network is running a private\nIP address scheme of any sort,\n\n84\n00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.034\nwhether that's anything\nin the ten network,\n\n85\n00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:21.382\nanything in the 172.16 all the way\nthrough 17231, or 192168 network.\n\n86\n00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:25.347\nAny of those, if that's the way\nmy network prefix begins,\n\n87\n00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:30.104\nthen I know that somewhere before me,\nbefore I get out to the Internet,\n\n88\n00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:33.147\nthat I'm actually going to get translated.\n\n89\n00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:36.830\nI'm gonna have that Network Address\nTranslation ending up working.\n\n90\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.210\nSo usually at least at the CCENT level,\nat CCENT level,\n\n91\n00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.510\nif there's anything on the basic\nconfiguration side that stops end to end\n\n92\n00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.500\nconnection or connectivity for you and me,\nespecially we go out across the internet,\n\n93\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.470\nit's going to be because\nwe didn't configure NAT.\n\n94\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.420\nThe great thing is, more than likely you\nand I are probably not gonna have to\n\n95\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.400\nconfigure it but we do need to\nunderstand how it's configured.\n\n96\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.360\nWe need to understand the translation\nof it because most of the time,\n\n97\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.660\nthat's gonna be one of the primary things.\n\n98\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.283\nBut in a lab setting, if you tried\nto build this up and go, brother,\n\n99\n00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:14.559\nI know that this is how these routers\nare connected together, and I can do this.\n\n100\n00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:18.573\nBut if I try and reach another network\nthat I'm not directly connected to, well,\n\n101\n00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:19.911\nI'm gonna also need NAT and\n\n102\n00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.370\nrouting to also be implemented to\nmake sure that that ends up working.\n\n103\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.860\nSo for us on the Internet,\nit is impossible for\n\n104\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.230\nus to actually be able to put a private\nIP address out on the Internet.\n\n105\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.095\nIt's just impossible.\n\n106\n00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:37.797\nAnd if an ISP gets found out that they\nlet a private IP address on the Internet,\n\n107\n00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.270\nit's gonna be a bad day for them.\n\n108\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.840\nSo usually they tell us like, you know,\nuse whatever private IP addresses, but\n\n109\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.000\nmake sure you turn on NAT on your\nparticular perimeter router, and\n\n110\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.590\nlet that end up happening.\n\n111\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.980\nSo the great thing is today though,\n\n112\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.600\nwe've got a lab that we're gonna end up\nusing, and I've got a couple of diagrams\n\n113\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.580\nthat's gonna help support the concept\nof what we end up seeing here too.\n\n114\n00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.660\nNow depending on which NAT that we do,\nand we're gonna\n\n115\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.778\ndo a sample of all three of them,\nis what we're going to do here, Zack.\n\n116\n00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:13.440\nBut we're gonna start off with of course,\nstatic NAT.\n\n117\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.890\nAnd you're gonna see that NAT,\n\n118\n00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.050\njust like access control lists,\nthere's a couple of parts to them.\n\n119\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.040\nSo if you remember the idea\nof access control lists,\n\n120\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.480\nwe can configure the access control lists\nbut that doesn't make it do anything.\n\n121\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.760\nI then have to apply\nthat to an interface and\n\n122\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.080\nthen also I have to apply\ndirectionality to that.\n\n123\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.345\nBut once I apply it to an interface,\nthen that is what allows that particular\n\n124\n00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:42.620\naddress access control list to\nactually get applied and work.\n\n125\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.720\nIn Network Address Translation\nyou have to decide two things.\n\n126\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.020\nYou have to decide what the NAT is\ngoing to be and how to configure it.\n\n127\n00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.260\nSo that's first.\n\n128\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:57.094\nAnd then, you have to be able to\nstate which way the NAT is working.\n\n129\n00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.815\nSo let's take a look at the diagram,\nand this will help us out, and\n\n130\n00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.814\nthen we'll do the configuration.\n\n131\n00:08:02.814 --> 00:08:06.063\nSo up at the top of the screen\nI have Static NAT here.\n\n132\n00:08:06.063 --> 00:08:08.435\nAnd we're gonna be using\nsome of these addresses so\n\n133\n00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:10.156\nI tried to keep them fairly similar.\n\n134\n00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.862\nSo let's take, for an example,\n\n135\n00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:17.830\nwe're gonna actually have 192.168.16.10.\n\n136\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:23.380\nAnd I need to get to this,\n172.15.0.10 over here.\n\n137\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.930\nOr practice-labs.com,\nwww.practice-labs.com.\n\n138\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.770\nNow, when I do so, on one interface\nit's gonna be 192.168.16.1,\n\n139\n00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.630\nwhich is gonna be gigabyte 0/0.\n\n140\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.150\nAnd then of course, 172.14.\n\n141\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.240\nDo not be fooled by this address here.\n\n142\n00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.797\nYou may go, hey, wait a minute,\n\n143\n00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:48.316\nthat's a private IP address cuz I\nremember something in the 172 range.\n\n144\n00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:53.708\nBut this is not 172.16 going\nall the way through 172.31.\n\n145\n00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:59.640\nThis is 172.14, so technically this\nis going to be a public IP address.\n\n146\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.560\nNow we're using it as just an example\ninside of our lab here, but\n\n147\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.850\nthat's what you'll end up seeing.\n\n148\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.530\nSo the first thing that we want to do\nis that on the interface here, and\n\n149\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.705\nwe're configuring it right here\nat the beginning because that way\n\n150\n00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:17.210\nwe'll make sure that we have it for\nall of our configurations regardless\n\n151\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.100\nof whether we are doing a static,\ndynamic or Port Address Translation.\n\n152\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:27.210\nYou have to decide which side is gonna\nbe considered the end side address and\n\n153\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.140\nwhich side is also gonna be considered\nthe outside address as well.\n\n154\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.240\nNow when you take a look\nat something like that,\n\n155\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.600\nthat doesn't really sound like,\nokay, so what's the big deal?\n\n156\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.220\nI know what my internal address is.\n\n157\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.570\nI know what my external address is.\n\n158\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.400\nBut it is a big deal because when we end\nup showing the translations, like I have\n\n159\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.420\ndown here in the second group of this one\ncommand here, do show IP NAT translations.\n\n160\n00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.270\nI just kind of abbreviated a little bit.\n\n161\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:02.000\nNotice that the table that it shows up,\nthe terminology is terrible.\n\n162\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.990\nThere's an inside global address.\n\n163\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.720\nThere's an inside local address.\n\n164\n00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.710\nThere's an outside local address.\n\n165\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.750\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n166\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.550\nWhat's an outside,\nwhat are these terms about?\n\n167\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.560\nWell, that's why it's important that, at\nleast for the way that the router works,\n\n168\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.680\nthat what we're defining is\nwhat side is actually what.\n\n169\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:28.540\nSo here I'm saying that gigabit ethernet\n0/0, this is gonna be my IP NAT inside.\n\n170\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.300\nWe would just going to the interface\nitself and we configure that.\n\n171\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.340\nSo this is what I would do if I'm\nactually trying to configure this and\n\n172\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.790\nmake sure that I get it right.\n\n173\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.406\nEven on the exam, you're gonna\nbe given a dry erase marker and\n\n174\n00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.980\nprobably laminated sheet of paper.\n\n175\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.360\nI would just draw a simple router,\na circle, put you know, just a plus sign.\n\n176\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.820\nThat way you kinda\nremember it's the router.\n\n177\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.030\nThen draw a little line off one side and\n\n178\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.360\nlabel whatever the interface\nis that they're telling you.\n\n179\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.650\nThen the other side label\nwhatever interface it is.\n\n180\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.860\nThen make a decision, which side is\ninside and which side is outside?\n\n181\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.330\nSo that's what you want to\nmake sure that you get.\n\n182\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.730\nThen you put the network\non what's the inside.\n\n183\n00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.710\nSo usually that's gonna be a\nrepresentation of the local area network.\n\n184\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.220\nAnd then on the other side is gonna\nbe a representation of course,\n\n185\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.090\non what is outside.\n\n186\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.660\nSo now by taking a look\nat the term inside and\n\n187\n00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.160\noutside, now Zack, when you take a look\nat how we do the show IP NAT trans,\n\n188\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.040\nnotice that they're really\njust grouping it and\n\n189\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.170\nwhat they're doing is they're making\nthe dividing line right here.\n\n190\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.742\nSo the information is inside global and\ninside local.\n\n191\n00:11:30.742 --> 00:11:31.533\nNow what the heck, again, does that mean?\n\n192\n00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:38.190\nWell, what they are telling you on\nthe inside local address as you do this,\n\n193\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:45.280\nis they're saying, from the standpoint of\nthis router, taking a look at the inside.\n\n194\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:52.306\nI know something, the address\nthat I'm seeing is 192.168.16.10.\n\n195\n00:11:52.306 --> 00:11:56.140\nSo that's the address that I\nknow that I'm seeing here.\n\n196\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.747\nThen, when it takes this packet and\nis sending it towards it's destination, so\n\n197\n00:12:00.747 --> 00:12:03.469\nhere it is,\nhere's my packet of information.\n\n198\n00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:08.081\nI'm setting it towards\nthe destination which is 172.15.0.10.\n\n199\n00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.526\nWell, according to this side,\nthe inside here,\n\n200\n00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:16.640\nthis interface when it looks at it,\nit says where is it going?\n\n201\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.980\nWell, what it's gonna do is say hey,\nit needs to go out of that interface,\n\n202\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.720\nwhich is the global side of things,\nwhich is outside of network.\n\n203\n00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.860\nBut there it gets translated\ninto 172.14.0.1, and\n\n204\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.780\nthis is where it places\na port number on it too.\n\n205\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.030\nNow, the initial one it doesn't.\n\n206\n00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.870\nOn the initial one, it just says,\nhey look, here it is.\n\n207\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.010\nWe're just going to make sure that\nwe can do that connection there, and\n\n208\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.540\nthat's what it does.\n\n209\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.010\nWhen it gets translated,\nthen you get this list that says hey,\n\n210\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.330\nI know what the protocol is you're using.\n\n211\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.940\nAnd now, let me make sure that I can\n\n212\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.040\ndistinguish this from whatever\nthe next packet is gonna be.\n\n213\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.270\nAnd this one showed up as being a 9.\n\n214\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:04.250\nAnd then the outside local is now saying\nas it leaves the interface, here's\n\n215\n00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:09.040\nwhat I'm seeing as being the source,\nwhat's on the router interface itself.\n\n216\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.850\n172, it's destination, sorry,\nI'm telling you wrong.\n\n217\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.290\nThe destination, so\n\n218\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.500\nit's actually looking at the destination\nheader here that we're seeing.\n\n219\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.420\nSo notice the outside local is looking\nat the destination information now,\n\n220\n00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.950\nand that's what we're also seeing, too.\n\n221\n00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.200\nSo now it's gonna go out and\ncan return back in.\n\n222\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.180\nSo this particular\nterminology is terrible.\n\n223\n00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.360\nI know it's very difficult\nto understand and follow.\n\n224\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.390\nSo I hate having to use it,\nbut you're gonna see this.\n\n225\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.070\nBut that's what you'll end up seeing here.\n\n226\n00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.520\nSo it is a little bit unusual.\n\n227\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.420\nOn the outside global,\nonce it hits the other side and\n\n228\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.720\nit bounces back,\nit will get that return as well.\n\n229\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.390\nAnd then when it comes\nback in it says hey,\n\n230\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.660\nI'm looking at it from the outside global,\ncoming back in, and\n\n231\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.190\nthen it can translate it back and\nsend it back to where it needs to go.\n\n232\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.410\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee how we can get this setup so\n\n233\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.086\nthat we can do static NAT here.\n\n234\n00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:08.850\nSo we're gonna be using practice labs,\nand there is going to be\n\n235\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.930\ninside of that Internet connecting Cisco\ndevices version three here, configure and\n\n236\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.442\nverify NAT is the one\nthat we're gonna use.\n\n237\n00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:19.680\nYou gotta wait a few minutes for\nall the devices to essentially turn on.\n\n238\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.200\nThe only one I manually turned on was\nthe PLABSCO01 machine, but we're gonna be\n\n239\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.070\nusing NY1 if I can get access and do it,\nand it actually did let me get into it.\n\n240\n00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.640\nSo I'm happy without\n\n241\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.700\na lot of confusion today.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n242\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:42.500\nSo now let's go ahead and scroll, and I've\nzoomed in a little bit to help us out.\n\n243\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.080\nLet me see if I can get access in.\n\n244\n00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.530\nAnd let's go to our global configuration.\n\n245\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.621\nNow that I'm in global configuration,\n\n246\n00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:59.110\nI always do this,\ndo show IP interface brief.\n\n247\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.680\nSo I'm using an abbreviation\nto help us out.\n\n248\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.620\nSo there are the two interfaces\nthat I need to understand about.\n\n249\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.670\nHopefully from your own working\ninside of your network,\n\n250\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.400\nyou know which side is your inside,\nand which side is the outside.\n\n251\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.130\nThe one that faces out to the Internet,\nthat's gonna be ethernet 0/1.\n\n252\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.480\nThe one facing my own network from my\nown default gateway is gonna be 0/0.\n\n253\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.380\nSo it's from here I would\nget into this interface.\n\n254\n00:15:25.802 --> 00:15:31.113\nGigabitethernet 0/0,\nthen I can do an IP nat,\n\n255\n00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:37.150\nand let's do a question mark so\nthat we can see it.\n\n256\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.730\nNotice there's four different examples for\nus, or\n\n257\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.030\noptions that we have, that we can do here.\n\n258\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.240\nAnd what we're looking at,\nof course, is the idea of inside and\n\n259\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.740\noutside at this point.\n\n260\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.360\nWe're not gonna worry about the enable and\nthe allow static-host, that's for\n\n261\n00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.870\nsomething else for right now.\n\n262\n00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.370\nSo let's just take a look at inside and\noutside.\n\n263\n00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.830\nExactly like it says,\nwhich side is gonna represent the inside?\n\n264\n00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.490\nFor you and me,\nthat's gonna be our own private LAN.\n\n265\n00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.979\nSo we're gonna say, ip nat inside.\n\n266\n00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:07.464\nNow, is there any other\noption after inside?\n\n267\n00:16:07.464 --> 00:16:09.926\nWell, notice it didn't show\nme any other options, so\n\n268\n00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:11.434\nit accepted the command itself.\n\n269\n00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:14.922\nThat's all we really need on\nthis interface for right now,\n\n270\n00:16:14.922 --> 00:16:19.160\nbecause this one has already\nconfigured its own IP addresses.\n\n271\n00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.710\nIf you're doing this\non your own equipment,\n\n272\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.970\nmake sure you configure an IP\naddress on the interfaces, as well.\n\n273\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.275\nAnd make sure you actually\nissue a no shutdown at the end.\n\n274\n00:16:27.275 --> 00:16:31.233\nSo now let's go ahead and\nchange this interface up here,\n\n275\n00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:33.904\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/1.\n\n276\n00:16:33.904 --> 00:16:40.850\nAnd now ip nat outside, all right?\n\n277\n00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.810\nSo this is actually pretty good, too.\n\n278\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:50.020\nIf I can do an ip show running-config,\nif I could spell it correctly.\n\n279\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.220\nAnd I'm just gonna scroll down to\nthat point where we're seeing those\n\n280\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.640\ninterfaces here.\n\n281\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.302\nAnd this is one of the main\nverifications here, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:59.302 --> 00:17:04.620\nIf anything is missed Zach, usually at the\nvery beginning when you start seeing this.\n\n283\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.410\nThere's two things here.\n\n284\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:11.450\nOne, is that you're missing both of these,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.960\nSo in other words, you just forgot, okay?\n\n286\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.716\nSo in other words,\nyou look and go, I see it,\n\n287\n00:17:15.716 --> 00:17:18.559\nthere's no NAT enabled on\neach of the interfaces.\n\n288\n00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:21.910\nTwo, they're just flipped backwards, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.780\nSo those are, by far,\nthe most common mistakes as we do NAT.\n\n290\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.810\nAnd usually if you have\neverything else set up and\n\n291\n00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.450\nit's still not working,\nit's probably you flipped them, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.720\nSo you go, I've got NAT inside and\noutside on the interfaces.\n\n293\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.098\nI just can't remember which one.\n\n294\n00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.010\nCheck those two, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Get them reversed.\n\n295\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:39.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz\n\n296\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.910\nreversing them is\nactually very easy to do.\n\n297\n00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.920\nThat's why you wanna make sure that you\nkind of logically look at this as you're\n\n298\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.020\nsetting it up.\n\n299\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.910\nAnd on the exam, right,\nthis is one of the hard parts.\n\n300\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.200\nYou can't stop and do a show command\nbetween everything that you type in.\n\n301\n00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.500\nDon't get me wrong, I shouldn't say that,\nyou can, but you lose valuable time.\n\n302\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.960\nSo it's you practicing and getting that\nmuscle memory in there, and saying\n\n303\n00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.140\nas I look at these interfaces, let me go\nahead and do a show IP interface brief.\n\n304\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.810\nLet me verify and then mark it down,\nput it down on that dry erase marker.\n\n305\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.220\nSay inside and then outside and\n\n306\n00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.510\nthen as you type in the commands make\nsure you go okay, I got that one right.\n\n307\n00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.780\nSo believe it or not that's one of the\nbiggest troubleshooting things that we can\n\n308\n00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.940\ndo, is just verify that we have inside and\n\n309\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.290\noutside on the proper interfaces or\nthat we have them at all, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.578\nThat's actually a good one\nto actually think about.\n\n311\n00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:34.012\nSo, if one of them is configured but\nthe other one is missing,\n\n312\n00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:36.120\nit's still not going to work.\n\n313\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.870\nOkay?\n\n314\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.770\nSo, this is what we're going to do for\nright now.\n\n315\n00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.600\nAll right.\nAll right, once we got that set, okay,\n\n316\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.506\nthe great thing is we really don't have\na lot more to do in terms of static.\n\n317\n00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:52.003\nExcept for to configure the actual\nstatic entry for NAT here.\n\n318\n00:18:52.003 --> 00:18:53.690\nLet me get all the way to the end here.\n\n319\n00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.210\nWe'll get back out to the global\nconfiguration mode and\n\n320\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.900\nthen once we're there, I can now\nstart typing in the NAT translation.\n\n321\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.590\nSo it's ip nat, and now you'll see\nthat there's a lot of options, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.010\nSo let me press this so\nthat we can see it step by step here.\n\n323\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.298\nAfter ip nat, now notice that as\nshort as that command is right?\n\n324\n00:19:14.298 --> 00:19:19.050\nNat, look at all these stuff, stateful,\ncreate, inside, log, outside,\n\n325\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.104\npiggyback-support, pool, portmap,\nservice, sip, source, translation.\n\n326\n00:19:24.104 --> 00:19:29.210\nYou name it, there's so many different\nthings, okay, that are available there.\n\n327\n00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.400\nBut with a static entry,\nwe don't need everything.\n\n328\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.462\nI need ip nat and then inside right now.\n\n329\n00:19:38.462 --> 00:19:41.810\nCuz what I'm trying to do is I'm trying\nto configure a match here, okay.\n\n330\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.860\nSo I'm saying in NAT, I'm enabling IP NAT.\n\n331\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.000\nAnd now here's what the inside\nis gonna be represented by.\n\n332\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.620\nLet's do that.\n\n333\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.250\nInside is gonna be the source.\n\n334\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:01.930\nSo ip nat inside source.\n\n335\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:06.170\nAnd then from that point, let's do another\nquestion mark so that you can see it.\n\n336\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.950\nBecause I'm setting up static NAT.\n\n337\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.145\nWell take a look in my options here, Zach.\n\n338\n00:20:10.145 --> 00:20:12.739\nIf I'm gonna set up static NAT, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:19.880\nI would do ip nat inside source static.\n\n340\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.920\nNow what does static mean?\n\n341\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.840\nStatic means I'm gonna\ntype in the rest of this.\n\n342\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.536\nAnd I only want to translate at this point\nbecause it's a one-to-one translation\n\n343\n00:20:27.536 --> 00:20:28.287\nin a static net.\n\n344\n00:20:28.287 --> 00:20:33.591\nI want that lab machine 192.168.16.10,\n\n345\n00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:39.610\nand I want it to translate into\nanother address as well, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.483\nNow, before I do that, let me see,\n\n347\n00:20:41.483 --> 00:20:44.798\nlet me make sure I'm telling you\nyou the correct address here.\n\n348\n00:20:44.798 --> 00:20:50.524\nIt actually does say ten so\nin the lab guide that's what it says so\n\n349\n00:20:50.524 --> 00:20:54.245\nwe do 172.14.0.10, right?\n\n350\n00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.085\nSo there it is, I've now set\nthe NAT address translation to be\n\n351\n00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:06.139\n192.168.16.10 to 172.14.0.10.\n\n352\n00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:09.340\nNow here's where the caveat is, okay?\n\n353\n00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.390\nUsually for us, if our ISP has\nonly assigned up one IP address or\n\n354\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.050\ntwo IP addresses.\n\n355\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.120\nYou can't use somebody else's, because\nthis may actually be assigned to somebody\n\n356\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.920\nelse.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but just when I say that, right,\n\n357\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.530\nwe're not worried about it cuz\nwe're only inside on our own local\n\n358\n00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.720\ninternal network.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n359\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.970\n&gt;&gt; But at this point,\n\n360\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.080\nyou wouldn't do this in reality,\nas far as a public IP address and\n\n361\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.440\nusing it in production.\n\n362\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.200\nCuz, if I only got assigned one or two\naddresses, I'd be using somebody else's.\n\n363\n00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.180\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n364\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.440\nThey probably don't like that.\n\n365\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.971\nThey probably would actually\nlike you to not do that,\n\n366\n00:21:41.971 --> 00:21:43.544\nlet me put it that way.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:21:43.544 --> 00:21:45.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now,\n\n368\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.030\nonce we do this we are now\nready to verify, and\n\n369\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.720\nsee if it is actually working at all.\n\n370\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.640\nSo before I do that I need to do\na couple of other things, too, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:01.144\nSo at this point I need to shut down\nan interface over here on NYEDGE2.\n\n372\n00:22:01.144 --> 00:22:03.211\nLet me make sure I get here.\n\n373\n00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:04.740\nYep there we go.\n\n374\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.336\nAnd let me get inside of this.\n\n375\n00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:08.934\nCommand.\n\n376\n00:22:08.934 --> 00:22:11.540\nOops.\nThen press Enter a couple of times.\n\n377\n00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.150\nUsually that what has to happen first.\n\n378\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.090\nThe we'll go into our\nglobal configuration.\n\n379\n00:22:19.545 --> 00:22:22.540\nAnd from here I'm going\nto shut down gigabit.\n\n380\n00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:30.241\nEthernet 0/0.\n\n381\n00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:33.585\nOops, 90/0 how's that?\n\n382\n00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:38.037\nInterface g0/0.\n\n383\n00:22:38.037 --> 00:22:39.753\nMake it easier for me.\n\n384\n00:22:39.753 --> 00:22:42.150\nAnd we're gonna just shut\nthis one down for right now.\n\n385\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.310\nAll right, now there's a couple of\ndifferent addresses that are on there.\n\n386\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.541\nBut for right now, this is one of\nthe steps that they have us doing,\n\n387\n00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:54.680\nwhich is simply just shutting\ndown this interface that we want.\n\n388\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.520\nAnd now we can go to our lab machine,\nwhich is gonna be the PLAB here, SC01.\n\n389\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.940\nAnd inside that PLAB,\nI'm to open open up the command prompt.\n\n390\n00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.630\nAnd let's change that so\nthat we can see this a little bit easier.\n\n391\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.050\nChange it there, change the screen\ntext to a color we can see.\n\n392\n00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:22.380\nGrey on black, I don't know why that was\nchosen as a default, but whatever it is,\n\n393\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.650\nyou know who knows.\n\n394\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.310\nOkay.\n\n395\n00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.432\nSo from this point let's see what happens\n\n396\n00:23:28.432 --> 00:23:33.274\nhere when I ping 172.14.0.2, okay.\n\n397\n00:23:33.274 --> 00:23:36.956\nNow, it doesn't look like it's\nactually working here, okay.\n\n398\n00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:40.470\nBut notice it actually did drop\na single ping and then it picked up and\n\n399\n00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.830\nit started to work here.\n\n400\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.770\nSo, it looks like we are good.\n\n401\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:48.020\nSo how do I verify that NAT\ntranslations are happening?\n\n402\n00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.991\nIf I now scroll back over to the lab, and\n\n403\n00:23:52.991 --> 00:23:56.163\nthen I go into NYEDGE1.\n\n404\n00:23:56.163 --> 00:24:00.190\nI can now from the privileged exec mode,\n\n405\n00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:04.108\ntype in show ip nat translations here.\n\n406\n00:24:04.108 --> 00:24:04.938\nAnd there you go.\n\n407\n00:24:04.938 --> 00:24:08.946\nWhat you're looking for\nIs what we're seeing here, okay?\n\n408\n00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:12.300\nSo the first marker is\nwhat we call protocol.\n\n409\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.000\nAnd it's telling me that at\nthe very beginning it saw it, but\n\n410\n00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000\nit didn't recognize it\nas protocol right away.\n\n411\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.810\nIt started to do something.\n\n412\n00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:26.040\nBut then it said hey, here's a ping,\nwhich is ICMP, which is fine.\n\n413\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.130\nThen it started taking a look\nat the global inside and\n\n414\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.630\nthe inside local addresses.\n\n415\n00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.420\nSo you can see where it's actually\na little bit unusual, right?\n\n416\n00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.930\nIt went from PC lab,\nthat PC that we just pinged from.\n\n417\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:46.270\nThen it knew that it's\ndestination was 172140.10.\n\n418\n00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:46.930\nOkay.\n\n419\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.790\nFrom that point, it then went ahead and\nstarted dashing again.\n\n420\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.670\nMake the translation now\nusing of course ICMP.\n\n421\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:25:00.540\nWhere it says you're pinging\nfrom here to here as well.\n\n422\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.460\nBut when it leaves the router's interface,\nokay.\n\n423\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:12.743\nIt sees it instead as 172 14.0.2 instead,\nokay?\n\n424\n00:25:12.743 --> 00:25:16.720\nSo even though,\naccording to what we're seeing,\n\n425\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.150\nokay, it did translate it into ten.\n\n426\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:25.794\nBut when it comes back to the router\nfrom where that was, right, the 0.2.\n\n427\n00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:31.540\nIt came back from that 0.2, and now it can\ntranslate it all the way back here, okay?\n\n428\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.380\nSo it did translate exactly\nlike it said it would,\n\n429\n00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.800\nwhich is listed right here,\nand now we're seeing that.\n\n430\n00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:45.390\nThis is the verification command that you\nwant which is show ip nat translations.\n\n431\n00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.749\nIf you see that,\nthen you're actually ready to go.\n\n432\n00:25:47.749 --> 00:25:52.161\nNow, another one that you can do, it's not\ngonna be very good on static NAT here, but\n\n433\n00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:54.110\nlet's show it to you anyways.\n\n434\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.580\nShow ip nat stat,\nwhich is actually short for statistics.\n\n435\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.410\nSo once you have something like this,\nyou're taking a look again.\n\n436\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.690\nAnd this is actually a good one to\nhelp you to verify, NAT inside and\n\n437\n00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.030\noutside, as well.\n\n438\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:12.870\nYou can see right here,\ndid this actually get the right ones,\n\n439\n00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.550\non inside interfaces and\noutside interfaces?\n\n440\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.710\nOkay, since this is a single static entry,\nwhich is perfectly fine,\n\n441\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.630\nthat's what we have here, okay?\n\n442\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.850\nNotice the other thing that\nwe're looking for is hits, okay?\n\n443\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.260\nHits means NAT was actually\nhit seven times here, so\n\n444\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.560\nyes, I know it did end up working.\n\n445\n00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.810\nAnd right now it's already expired okay,\nnow what does that mean?\n\n446\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:41.330\nWell let's type in a show\nip nat translations again.\n\n447\n00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.850\nAnd now notice it's starting to weed out\nthe oldest ones that we see here and\n\n448\n00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.160\nleave it in, and\nsoon this will also be weeded out as well.\n\n449\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.340\nSo it doesn't stay in the address\ntranslation table forever and ever, okay?\n\n450\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.340\nSo a single entry, right, for what you and\nI are doing, okay, is usually gonna\n\n451\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.790\nlimit that one to one translation is what\nwe're gonna end up seeing here, okay?\n\n452\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.410\nSo that is just the beginning.\n\n453\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.610\nNow, let's talk about this for\na moment, too, Zach.\n\n454\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.170\nWhen the heck would I use\na static translation anymore?\n\n455\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.140\nWell, the reason why most\npeople don't use it, right?\n\n456\n00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.380\nIs because we have more than one device\nthat needs to get out to the Internet.\n\n457\n00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.785\nSo a static translation\nisn't really that good for\n\n458\n00:27:21.785 --> 00:27:25.760\nday-to-day use or people on workstations.\n\n459\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.820\nBut what it is good for\nis something like this.\n\n460\n00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.630\nWhat if I still wanted to keep my\nown web server internally, okay?\n\n461\n00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.840\nShouldn't do that, but let's say\nthat you want to keep it internally.\n\n462\n00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.510\nBut then you wanted to make sure that\nthe outside world didn't have to type in\n\n463\n00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:49.280\nan internal address from the Internet\nto get access to my web server.\n\n464\n00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.260\nI want to say here's what the IP address\nis that you type in to get here.\n\n465\n00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.980\nAnd so when the traffic actually\ndoes leave that web server, right?\n\n466\n00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.010\nIt actually reports it as being whatever\nIP address I gave it on that end.\n\n467\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:07.200\nSo this is where you would go to your ISP,\nor\n\n468\n00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.140\nyou know, the ICANN or\nwhoever's in control of your addresses.\n\n469\n00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.160\nYou tell them, I need two addresses, or\nI need four addresses or whatever it is.\n\n470\n00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.710\nAnd they'll sell them in blocks of four,\nand then eight, and then 16, 32 etc.\n\n471\n00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.946\nBut that way you can use your\nown public IP addresses, and\n\n472\n00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:25.786\nyou assign one of them then\nto one of your servers.\n\n473\n00:28:25.786 --> 00:28:28.300\nSame thing with an email server,\nyou want to.\n\n474\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.760\nEven if you kept them on the inside.\n\n475\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.680\nBut web servers are probably\nmore primarily where you\n\n476\n00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.590\nwould see something like\nthis as you're doing this.\n\n477\n00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.950\nAnd even for testing,\nit's actually really good.\n\n478\n00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.610\nThat way you can always verify\n\n479\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.890\nthat you made your configurations\non your own internal web server.\n\n480\n00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.570\nBut if you put it behind a router\nis it actually going to get there?\n\n481\n00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.630\nSo that way even in testing,\nsetting up static nat for\n\n482\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.070\nthat is always gonna be good as well.\n\n483\n00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.510\nSo it's a big part of what\nwe begin to do here, okay?\n\n484\n00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.610\nSo the key elements,\nlet's go back here just for\n\n485\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.340\na moment to make sure that we understand,\nright?\n\n486\n00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.730\nTwo parts to the configuration.\n\n487\n00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:09.440\nMake sure that we have nat inside and\noutside on the correct interfaces.\n\n488\n00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.015\nAnd then you want to make sure,\nof course, oops.\n\n489\n00:29:12.015 --> 00:29:13.707\nI don't know what I did here.\n\n490\n00:29:13.707 --> 00:29:15.340\nI don't need this next line.\n\n491\n00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.350\nThat is what I get for\n\n492\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.510\nnot paying attention to my own\ntyping as I am doing stuff.\n\n493\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.300\nI do not know why I did that, okay.\n\n494\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.984\nSo if you've been\nwatching the whole thing,\n\n495\n00:29:22.984 --> 00:29:25.080\nlike look he messed up he\ndidn't finish that line.\n\n496\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:31.280\nThat was just me not finishing anything\nhere, okay That is right, so IP nat.\n\n497\n00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.380\nSo the inside source here, right,\nis gonna be the static that I gave it.\n\n498\n00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.700\nThat entry right there, so\nthat's that term static.\n\n499\n00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.220\nAnd then what address do I\nwant to translate it to?\n\n500\n00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.660\nI probably should have translated\nthat into a 10, but I didn't do it.\n\n501\n00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.640\nSo that's what I get for trying to kind\nof copy this and do it differently.\n\n502\n00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.240\nOkay?\n\n503\n00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.640\nSo that's what you're\nalso seeing right here.\n\n504\n00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.050\nSo that does work for us, okay.\n\n505\n00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.000\nAnd this is probably the second\nmost popular way to use this.\n\n506\n00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.220\nSo now we need to begin to also\nconfigure what we call dynamic NAT.\n\n507\n00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.760\nDynamic NAT is the least used of\nthe ones that we have available to us.\n\n508\n00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.730\nBut it is still an important\npart of the configuration and\n\n509\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:17.030\nyou do need to be able to distinguish that\nconfiguration from what we just saw here.\n\n510\n00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:21.180\nBut Zach, it looks like that I've run\nout of time for this particular episode.\n\n511\n00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.055\nSo that means we need to go into\na part two on configuring NAT.\n\n512\n00:30:25.055 --> 00:30:25.855\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie,\n\n513\n00:30:25.855 --> 00:30:29.475\neverything was clear and\nthis has been Configuring NAT, Part One.\n\n514\n00:30:29.475 --> 00:30:33.725\nYou wanna see Configuring NAT, Part Two,\nDynamic NATs coming up, good stuff.\n\n515\n00:30:33.725 --> 00:30:38.235\nAnd make sure you watch everything\ninside the Sysco Z set series, but\n\n516\n00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:39.105\nbefore we move on.\n\n517\n00:30:39.105 --> 00:30:41.305\nRonnie, would you like\nto say something else?\n\n518\n00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:41.895\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\n\n519\n00:30:41.895 --> 00:30:44.825\nthis is one of those other\nadditional concepts that's a little\n\n520\n00:30:44.825 --> 00:30:47.030\nbit hard to understand at the beginning.\n\n521\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.830\nIf you dealt with networking at any\npoint you've probably heard people talk\n\n522\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.640\nabout the idea of NAT here.\n\n523\n00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.190\nBut just remember,\nyou're now learning how to configure it.\n\n524\n00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.950\nAnd more importantly, you're learning\nabout those configuration elements that\n\n525\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.100\nyou're going to have to troubleshoot.\n\n526\n00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.930\nSo we've shown you some\ngood information here, and\n\n527\n00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.630\nverifying those interfaces is key.\n\n528\n00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.150\nIf there is a configuration\nissue a lot of times.\n\n529\n00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:14.090\nBecause if you've practiced this enough,\nyou get the syntax down, but\n\n530\n00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.618\nstill putting it on the right\ninterfaces is pretty hard.\n\n531\n00:31:16.618 --> 00:31:21.100\nSo, I recommend the same thing that\nI did for Access control lists.\n\n532\n00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.410\nDo not move on from this concept\nuntil it makes sense to you.\n\n533\n00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:30.790\nDon't jump ahead, continue to work through\nthis concept until it makes 100% sense.\n\n534\n00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.310\nBecause if you continue to move on and\n\n535\n00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.450\nit doesn't, then it's going to kind of\nbite you later on, I guarantee you.\n\n536\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:41.030\nSo stay tuned, make sure you practice, and\nwe'll show you some more information here\n\n537\n00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.550\non that in the next episode.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice and a great series.\n\n538\n00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.490\nSysco Z said, see every episode,\nit will help you.\n\n539\n00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.720\nAnd you'll be in the course library\nwhere there's thousands of other videos.\n\n540\n00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.370\nThey're there to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n541\n00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.250\nSo check those out, too.\n\n542\n00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.950\nTell everybody you know about IT Pro TV,\nwould you?\n\n543\n00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.680\nIT Pro TV is

00:00:16.770\nEmpowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.470\nI'm your host, Zach Memos for\nthis episode of Cisco CCENT.\n\n8\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.250\nConfigure NAT part two.\n\n9\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.290\nAnd of course, we have Ronnie Wong back.\n\n10\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.975\nThere he is right there.\n\n11\n00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zack, thank you fo rhaving me back\non the show as we condtinue on once again,\n\n13\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.960\nlearning more, and of course,\ngetting ready for that CSEN exam.\n\n14\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.028\nAnd we are in the middle of a lab\nwhere we're configuring, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:40.127\nnat translations here.\n\n16\n00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.850\n&gt;&gt; So, we've just in the first part\nconfigured a static nat translation,\n\n18\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.660\nthat means a one to one translation.\n\n19\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.060\nWe also, of course, showed you not only\nthat, you know the configuration itself.\n\n20\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.720\nWe explained to you how\nthat works as well.\n\n21\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.040\nWe pointed out some of the dangers\nthat you have to actually think about.\n\n22\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.010\nWhen you troubleshoot this.\n\n23\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.220\nAnd you'll probably see that on the exam,\nso make sure you pay attention.\n\n24\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.200\nGo back to that first episode if you don't\nunderstand anything that we're talking\n\n25\n00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.360\nabout right here, cuz we're about to jump\na little bit deeper into this concept.\n\n26\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou've got to teased dynamic NAT.\n\n27\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.082\nAnd it sounds to me like dynamic NAT would\nbe something that would be used more.\n\n28\n00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:19.350\nYou said its not used as much.\n\n29\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYeah, Dynamic NAT is kind of a strange\n\n30\n00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.780\nthing, cuz what started to happen,\nin the early days, right?,\n\n31\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.270\nas NAT this implemantation came\non that they realized something.\n\n32\n00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.710\nThat if my company continues to grow,\nlet's say that even small companies\n\n33\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.010\nhere it was, once they figured out\nhow to deplete the IP version for\n\n34\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.100\naddresses less, the problem was if we\ndid static map, it meant that what?\n\n35\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.068\nEvery single person that had to be\nable to get access to the internet,\n\n36\n00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:54.764\nthen had to also have\na matching public IP address.\n\n37\n00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:58.120\nAnd that didn't seem like it\nactually helped very much.\n\n38\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.450\nSo, that's why you start seeing this\nlimitations things that have the public,\n\n39\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.450\nor the internet may need,\nsuch as web servers, an email server,\n\n40\n00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.390\nDNA servers stuff like that if\nyou choose to do something.\n\n41\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.772\nBut for us let's just take what the web\nserver, cuz is most common to us.\n\n42\n00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:19.340\nSo, what did I say well what if you\nonly have a few public IP addresses.\n\n43\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.370\nBut you still had that same Class C\nnetwork inside on your internal lan,\n\n44\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.810\nabout 254 addresses.\n\n45\n00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.170\nWell, what can you do if\nyou do something like this?\n\n46\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.900\nWell, what they say is that,\nwhat we can do is,\n\n47\n00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.350\nthat we can create a pool out of\nthat public IP address instead.\n\n48\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.616\nSo, let's say that now your ISP is\nactually giving you a pool of eight public\n\n49\n00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:45.562\nIP addresses, and when they've done\nthat you really don't get all.\n\n50\n00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:48.270\nHey, the reason why is you actually\nneed one for your network ID.\n\n51\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.710\nYou don't get to use that one.\n\n52\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.020\nYou also need one for your broadcast.\n\n53\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.290\nYou don't get to us that one.\n\n54\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.040\nSo, now you actually are left with six.\n\n55\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.150\nAnd then you go, all right, now that\nI've still got 254 I can allow for\n\n56\n00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.580\na few connections at a time, but\n\n57\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.060\nnot every single device to\nbe connected any one time.\n\n58\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.980\nAnd if I did static,\nit would mean I have to reconfigure my\n\n59\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.930\nrouter each time somebody new\nwould have to configure it.\n\n60\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.940\nBut dynamic just says,\nlook, let's do it this way.\n\n61\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.360\nI'll set up that pool of\nthree public IP addresses.\n\n62\n00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.360\nAnd then, when whoever actually needs\nit connects in, if it's not being used,\n\n63\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.500\nthey'll get to use that one, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.530\nAnd then, when it is being used and\n\n65\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.340\na fourth one comes along, well,\nthen they'll have to wait, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.915\nThey'll just have to wait until one of\nthose clears up, and then we're fine.\n\n67\n00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:39.400\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, that is something that can be done.\n\n68\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.440\nJust kind of realize, it is possible, but\n\n69\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.100\nit's not really used very often anymore,\nokay?\n\n70\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Ane the reason why is that even thought\n\n71\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.350\nthat started help us out, it also was\na cuz that meant everybody could not\n\n72\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.320\nactually get connected\nin at the same time.\n\n73\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.190\nAnd as more and\nmore companies started growing\n\n74\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.730\neverybody in networks actually\nneed access to the internet.\n\n75\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.970\nWell, that became more of a bottle\nneck by saying, all right,\n\n76\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.950\nI need more public IP addresses again,\nstarted depleting public IP address.\n\n77\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.840\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; And now, you started having issues.\n\n78\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.300\nSo, even though this worked, it probalby\nworked for a brief period of time, but\n\n79\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.240\nit wasn't anything that was\nsuppposed to be there forever.\n\n80\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.180\nAnd actually speaking of that, right?\n\n81\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.970\nRemember, I said that in back in\nnetworking again if you don't, go back and\n\n82\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.640\ncheck those shows out again.\n\n83\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.410\nThat, these particular temporary aspects,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.210\nOf trying to keep IP version four just\nin was really meant to be temporary.\n\n85\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.010\nSelect NAT address\ntranslation to NAT itself.\n\n86\n00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.172\nWas really only meant to be temporary\nuntil we switched over to IP version six.\n\n87\n00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:40.791\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n88\n00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:43.145\n&gt;&gt; It was never really\nmeant to be there forever.\n\n89\n00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n90\n00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.780\nit was supposed to be essentially\nan intermediary, or a stop gap.\n\n91\n00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.460\nAnd say, all right,\nwhile we're transitioning over,\n\n92\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.370\nlet's use this to help us out.\n\n93\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.510\nAnd then, once we get IPv6,\n\n94\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.870\nyou'll actually end up going to IPv6,\nand now you won't have to need map.\n\n95\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.820\nWell, people didn't understand that\nwhen IPV6 started getting popular.\n\n96\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.960\nSo, how do I do map with it?\n\n97\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.630\nWell, you had to remind everybody,\nyou don't have to do map anymore, but\n\n98\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.430\npeople still want it.\n\n99\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.020\nSo, there's probably a way.\n\n100\n00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.340\nI bet you there's a way\nto still translate.\n\n101\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.310\nProbably in address to some,\na private IPv6 to a public IPv6 address.\n\n102\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.830\nI'm sure somebody has come\nup with it at some point.\n\n103\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.390\nBut it's nothing that we really\nneed to worry about, or use.\n\n104\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.110\nSo, its goal is to get rid of NAT, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.287\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz NAT can cause issues, but for\n\n106\n00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:36.101\nus the pull is actually a called\na mini to mini translation, all right?\n\n107\n00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:41.439\nWe only have a few public IP addresses,\nbut I have a lot of internal\n\n108\n00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:47.710\nprivate IP addresses that I can only\nuse as many as I have at that point.\n\n109\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.860\nSo, we need to understand\nabout that configuration and\n\n110\n00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.000\nshow you also what it does.\n\n111\n00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.140\nSo, let's take a look at my screen\nhere and we'll go ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.530\ntalk about just the basic configuration.\n\n113\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.400\nThis one is a little bit more\ntechnically challenging.\n\n114\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.890\nAnd the reason why is that\nthere's a lot more words to it.\n\n115\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.780\nAnd this can get a little bit crazy here.\n\n116\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.300\nOkay?\n\n117\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.390\nSo, with static, right?\n\n118\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.080\nWhen we did it it was pretty much\njust two configurations, right?\n\n119\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.950\nWe have, of course,\nthe interface configurations,\n\n120\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.000\nwhich we've left on the routers,\nwhich is what we wanna do.\n\n121\n00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.820\nAnd then, we have this one line, ip nat\ninside source static, and that line, and\n\n122\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.140\nthen we're ready to go, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.970\nSo, that was good, but now with dynamic\nwe still have to verify, you know?\n\n124\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.328\nThat we have these correct, which we do.\n\n125\n00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:33.786\nBut then, when we get into this,\nthis one here, okay, that I did,\n\n126\n00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:36.990\nnotice it actually requires two events.\n\n127\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.630\nThe first one here is an access list.\n\n128\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.058\nThe standard access list, and the reason\nwhy is that we're not using the access\n\n129\n00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:48.104\nlist to fill a printing,\nnotice we're permitting something instead.\n\n130\n00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:53.019\nSo, I'm an actually saying in\nthis particular access list,\n\n131\n00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:58.420\npermit the 192.168.16 network\nis what I'm doing here.\n\n132\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.900\nNow, that actually is about\nidentification more than anything else, so\n\n133\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.120\nnow I'm just using it as an alias.\n\n134\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.640\nI'm using an access list\nhere to get this number 11.\n\n135\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.469\nSo, I don't have to type in this\nentirety again as I start to do this\n\n136\n00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.212\nthe pool that I need to.\n\n137\n00:07:17.212 --> 00:07:21.528\nSo, I'm gonna create an access list first,\n\n138\n00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:26.753\nonce I do that for\naccepting my internal ip addresses,\n\n139\n00:07:26.753 --> 00:07:33.360\nnow I need to configure the nat pool\nIP nat pool then you give it a name.\n\n140\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.070\nNow, I went ahead and\njust called the name of the router,\n\n141\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.535\ncuz I couldn't come up with anything\nfancy at this point in my head here.\n\n142\n00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:42.704\nSo, I cave it the name\nof theoruter itself, and\n\n143\n00:07:42.704 --> 00:07:47.790\nthen you put a range of IP addresses\nin here, the public IP addresses.\n\n144\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.468\nSo, I selected .1 through .3,\n\n145\n00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:54.587\njust as an example of four IP addresses,\nis what I did.\n\n146\n00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:59.205\nThe hard part of this comes in\nwhen you see this element, okay.\n\n147\n00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:02.913\nIf you hit a question mark after the 0.3.\n\n148\n00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:08.079\nYou're gonna see the term netmask there,\nand in my mind,\n\n149\n00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:13.254\nI automatically flip that\ninto some subnet mask, right.\n\n150\n00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:19.100\nWell you actually have to use that syntax,\nthat keyword right there, netmask.\n\n151\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.400\nI don't know why, but\nwe tend to miss that.\n\n152\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.785\nIf we just type in the 255.255.255 and\n\n153\n00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:29.064\nforget the word netmask,\nit's a wrong, syntactical error.\n\n154\n00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:32.391\nSo that means you'll get counted\nwrong on that on the exam.\n\n155\n00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.230\nSo make sure you use this\nword netmask right here.\n\n156\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.060\nI probably should have highlighted\nit like I did on another\n\n157\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.570\nslide when we get to this here.\n\n158\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.760\nNow, let me just go ahead and\n\n159\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.670\nchange that color to emphasize that\na little bit better to help us out.\n\n160\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.430\nYeah, there we go, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.790\nSo make sure you key in on that, cuz I\nknow and I've seen the configuration,\n\n162\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.620\nI've made the mistake myself.\n\n163\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.520\nWhen I hit that question mark, I go,\nyeah, it just wants a network mask, and\n\n164\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.070\nI forget to type in this word itself,\nand it doesn't work.\n\n165\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.160\nAnd I'm like, why didn't this work?\n\n166\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.890\nAnd then finally I go back and I examine\nit like I forgot something here and\n\n167\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.580\nthat's the word netmask.\n\n168\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.930\nSo now that we have an access control\nlist, which is a second line, we now have\n\n169\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.940\ncreated our pool that we call ny, or not\nny, but just EDGE1 for right now, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.520\nNow that I've got both of those,\nI need this fourth line right here, right?\n\n171\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.380\nWe added in the configure terminal\nto combine them both together, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.678\nSo to combine the access list and\nthe pool together,\n\n173\n00:09:31.678 --> 00:09:35.889\nis ip nat the inside source\nis gonna be my list 11.\n\n174\n00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:40.260\nWhich means refer back up to here to\nthis access list that we created.\n\n175\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:48.150\nAnd the outside, okay, is gonna be the\npool EDGE1, okay, is what it's gonna be.\n\n176\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.540\nSo that third line combines\nthem both together.\n\n177\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.857\nSo if you can remember that order,\nthat dynamic nat requires you to create\n\n178\n00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:59.980\nan access control list,\nit requires you to also build a pool, and\n\n179\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.670\nthen we need a statement that\ncombines them both together.\n\n180\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.770\nThat will help you out, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.550\nSo now, we're ready to see this in action.\n\n182\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.240\nBut don't forget, make sure you\nalso configure the interfaces too.\n\n183\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.590\nNow I left the interface configuration,\nbut I also needed to do one other thing as\n\n184\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.890\nwe get started right back here on NYEDGE1,\nokay.\n\n185\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.933\nNow, let's say that we were\nrunning static net and\n\n186\n00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:28.545\nnow we wanted to change and\ntry this dynamic nat here.\n\n187\n00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:32.580\nI can't leave the current\nconfiguration in there.\n\n188\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.800\nSo, let's go ahead and get rid of this\ncurrent configuration, as well, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.102\nSo, if I get into the global\nconfiguration mode,\n\n190\n00:10:43.102 --> 00:10:47.016\nand I wanna get rid of the static nat,\n\n191\n00:10:47.016 --> 00:10:52.064\nit's fairly simple,\nI just do a no ip nat here,\n\n192\n00:10:52.064 --> 00:10:57.893\nand then when I do this,\ninside source static, okay.\n\n193\n00:10:57.893 --> 00:11:01.427\nSo, inside source static,\n\n194\n00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:06.145\nand 192.168.16.10 and\n\n195\n00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:09.691\n172.14.0.10.\n\n196\n00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:13.904\nAnd that will get rid of\nthat static translation.\n\n197\n00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:16.683\nI know it sounds hard but\nif you're going to actually try and\n\n198\n00:11:16.683 --> 00:11:18.860\nrun both it's not gonna work, okay.\n\n199\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.860\nSo you want to get rid of that.\n\n200\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.558\nNow, the second thing that we have to do,\nand\n\n201\n00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:27.111\nyou can actually verify this in one way or\nthe other, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.983\nBut usually,\nthe other thing that you want to do here,\n\n203\n00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:33.180\nis you want to clear away\nthe nat translation table.\n\n204\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.668\nSo, let me type in something here and\nshow you.\n\n205\n00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:42.943\nClear ip nat translations, and\nyou wanna clear them all now.\n\n206\n00:11:42.943 --> 00:11:45.830\nNow, I'm gonna stop right here for\na moment,\n\n207\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.400\nbecause this is where it gets tricky.\n\n208\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.700\nLet me show you what I\"m talking about.\n\n209\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.880\nThat looks good, right?\n\n210\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.613\nI wanna clear out all my nat translations.\n\n211\n00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:54.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense.\n\n212\n00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:59.104\nInvalid input detected.\n\n213\n00:11:59.104 --> 00:11:59.995\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Zach,\n\n214\n00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:03.587\nbecause you might not exactly know\nwhat the invalid translation and\n\n215\n00:12:03.587 --> 00:12:08.005\nlet me hit the enter a couple of times\nhere, they're right above my head.\n\n216\n00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:11.800\nBelieve it or not,\nthe invalid part is right there.\n\n217\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.860\nThe letter S, that is the invalid part.\n\n218\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.518\n&gt;&gt; The letter S.\n\n219\n00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:19.630\n&gt;&gt; The letter S, it makes it invalid.\n\n220\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:25.130\nSo, the actual command that we need,\nwhich is clear ip nat\n\n221\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.430\ntranslation, and then an asterisk, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.780\nSo that's why, and notice it accepted and\ndidn't complain that time at all.\n\n223\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.618\nSo there is a difference between clear\nip nat translations with an s and\n\n224\n00:12:41.618 --> 00:12:44.987\nthe asterisk and\nthen clear ip nat translation.\n\n225\n00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Do not pluralize that.\n\n226\n00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that is important\nbecause I'm gonna tell you something.\n\n227\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.860\nIf you want to actually miss a question\njust because of a letter S, yee.\n\n228\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.262\nI mean, that's just missing points.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's just bad.\n\n229\n00:12:57.262 --> 00:12:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Just because of that one thing.\n\n230\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.800\nSo that's why it requires you\nto pay much more attention\n\n231\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.540\non these configuration when you do so.\n\n232\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.350\nThen, I can actually just do this.\n\n233\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.325\nWhich is,\nhere's why it becomes weird, right?\n\n234\n00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:13.392\nI wanna see that ip nat translation, so\n\n235\n00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:20.400\nI do show ip nat translations,\ngo figure, and now it says that.\n\n236\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.814\nSo notice,\nit really is not consistent, right?\n\n237\n00:13:23.814 --> 00:13:26.700\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So, one is clear ip nat translation,\n\n238\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.170\nand then an asterisk,\nthe asterisk is a wildcard.\n\n239\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.770\nBut then if you want to show it,\nyou actually pluralize it.\n\n240\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.420\n&gt;&gt; Then you pluralize it.\n\n241\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so then you pluralize it, okay.\n\n242\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.346\nAnd what you're looking for is this,\n\n243\n00:13:37.346 --> 00:13:40.590\nis that it's not showing the translation\nlIke we saw a little bit earlier.\n\n244\n00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n245\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.150\n&gt;&gt; So now that clears it all out here,\nI know, isn't that neat?\n\n246\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.470\nThat's confusing.\n\n247\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Pay attention, pay attention.\n\n248\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.210\n&gt;&gt; This is why you want to slow\ndown through here because it's real\n\n249\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.390\neasy just to get into that idea.\n\n250\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.760\nNow, there's a way you can cheat, and\nI say that, but it's simple, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.181\nIf you start typing this right here, clear\nip nat and you get to this point trans,\n\n252\n00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:07.943\nand then all you have to do\nis an asterisk, it will work.\n\n253\n00:14:07.943 --> 00:14:10.770\nThe reason why is because it\ndoes an auto fill for you.\n\n254\n00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.130\nIt says, there's no other command\nlike this so it will fill it in and\n\n255\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.880\nthen you can do that.\n\n256\n00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.130\nSo if you want to try\nthat abbreviation now.\n\n257\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.380\nIf it doesn't accept\nthe abbreviation on the exam,\n\n258\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.890\nit means you have to type it out.\n\n259\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.080\nThat's why we went ahead and\ntyped it out for you as well, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.455\nSo I could just start going, yeah,\njust do this and it always worked, and\n\n261\n00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:30.699\nthen you go do the exam and it's like,\nit's not taking that command.\n\n262\n00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:34.050\nIt's showing me invalid input detected.\n\n263\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.720\nAnd now you're in trouble cuz you don't\nknow what the actual command is, so\n\n264\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.240\nthat's why we wanna type it out.\n\n265\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.343\nSo make sure you pay attention, all right.\n\n266\n00:14:40.343 --> 00:14:42.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's verify that we are no longer\n\n267\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.700\ngetting nat translations.\n\n268\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.810\nGo back to the lab machine here for\na moment.\n\n269\n00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.790\nAnd on the lab machine,\nI'm gonna try and ping the 14.0.2 and\n\n270\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.740\nlet's give it a moment here and\nsee if we can still ping.\n\n271\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.320\nAnd this time it's probably\nnot gonna allow it to happen.\n\n272\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.270\nThe reason why it's not allowing it to\nhappen right now is because it's not\n\n273\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.050\ngiving me that translation,\nwhich means I can't route from that\n\n274\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.650\nprivate IP address to the public\nIP address very easily.\n\n275\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.730\nSo, on this one, we're not allowing that,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n276\n00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.420\nThat's what we expected here.\n\n277\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.480\nSo, let's go ahead and figure the dynamic\npull then, back on NY edge one, here.\n\n278\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.680\nThat's what we'll do.\n\n279\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.000\nLet me kind of zoom in, so\nthat we can see it here.\n\n280\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.270\nSo now, let's go back into our\nglobal configuration mode, and\n\n281\n00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.330\nonce we're in here,\nthis is where we start.\n\n282\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.770\nSo, we're gonna create\na couple of different ones.\n\n283\n00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.580\nSo, let's kind of use\nthe same syntax that said.\n\n284\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.231\nFirst thing that I wanna do is I'm\ngonna create a nat transition pull and\n\n285\n00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:48.922\nif you keep it in that\nsame order it will help.\n\n286\n00:15:48.922 --> 00:15:51.973\nYou don't have to do it in this order,\nbut let's do it this way.\n\n287\n00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:53.755\nSo, I need to create\nan access control list.\n\n288\n00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:59.894\nSo, access-list and\nthis time we'll use 100 permit Okay,\n\n289\n00:15:59.894 --> 00:16:05.236\nso now we're actually saying\nas far as the 100 here,\n\n290\n00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:08.775\nactually I don't even need 100.\n\n291\n00:16:08.775 --> 00:16:12.250\nLet's do, cuz I just need\na standard access list here.\n\n292\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.910\nBut they actually have us doing 100,\nso we'll use theirs.\n\n293\n00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:21.551\nPermit, ip\n\n294\n00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:28.705\n192.168.16.0.\n\n295\n00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:33.207\nAnd then we have to do\nthis wild card mask, and\n\n296\n00:16:33.207 --> 00:16:36.770\nthen 172.14.0.0 here.\n\n297\n00:16:38.972 --> 00:16:41.576\nAnd then 255.255.\n\n298\n00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:46.062\nNow, this is strange, because the one that\nI use is just a standard access control\n\n299\n00:16:46.062 --> 00:16:48.690\nlist in my simple diagram that I did.\n\n300\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.150\nHere, in the lab, they have us\nconfiguring one that's actually for\n\n301\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.040\nusing an extended access control list.\n\n302\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.060\nI don't know why, but\n\n303\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.580\nwe'll go with their example since this\nis the one that works for their lab.\n\n304\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.410\nAt least from what I understand\nthat's what will end up working,\n\n305\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.170\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n306\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.120\nSo now we've gone ahead and configured\nthat, now again, look, there's that dollar\n\n307\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.170\nsign again telling me it's too long to\ndisplay on the screen, which is fine.\n\n308\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.540\nNow, I need to create\nthe pool of addresses here.\n\n309\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.900\nSo if I go ahead and\nnow create an IP, oops, look at that,\n\n310\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.935\nit doesn't like my typing any more.\n\n311\n00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:23.777\n[LAUGH] I know.\n\n312\n00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:31.720\nSo here let's create the pool,\nip nat pool.\n\n313\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.550\nAnd now we're going to\ngive it a name here.\n\n314\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:40.095\nAnd the name that we're giving\nit is one they call mydynamic,\n\n315\n00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:43.463\nwhich i can't spell,\n\n316\n00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:48.611\ndynamicpool 172.14.0.20.\n\n317\n00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:51.310\nAnd then we'll give the upper\nrange of this, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.273\nSo 172.14.0.100.\n\n319\n00:17:55.273 --> 00:17:59.049\nNow we're never gonna use all that, but\nlet me go and do that question mark,\n\n320\n00:17:59.049 --> 00:18:03.600\nlike I was telling you a little bit\nearlier here, so that we can see, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.237\nSo, once we get to this point,\nwhen you see that, okay, don't let your\n\n322\n00:18:08.237 --> 00:18:13.045\nbrain do what my brain does, look it\njust says specify the network mask.\n\n323\n00:18:13.045 --> 00:18:15.620\nOkay, so if I start typing in what?\n\n324\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.460\nThe subnet mask, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.630\nYou have to actually\ntype in the word netmask.\n\n326\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.040\nAnd you have to do so, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.815\nAnd that is the key here.\n\n328\n00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:30.520\nLet me copy and paste that so you don't\nhave to watch me type too much again.\n\n329\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.815\nNetmask and\nthis one on the network mask is\n\n330\n00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:39.934\n255.255.255.0.\n\n331\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.510\nAll right, so is everything\nconfigured the way that we want to?\n\n332\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.490\nWell, let's take a look at a couple\nof the different ones here.\n\n333\n00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.530\nShow ip nat, and\nwe'll just use statistics.\n\n334\n00:18:54.005 --> 00:18:56.105\nAnd I would spell it correctly,\nbut I don't know how to, so\n\n335\n00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:57.615\nI'm just gonna use stat.\n\n336\n00:18:57.615 --> 00:18:59.885\nRight now,\nmy brain is not working on the spelling.\n\n337\n00:18:59.885 --> 00:19:02.135\nSo, let's see here.\n\n338\n00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:06.585\nSo, currently, I just want to verify\nthat I have the interfaces here, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:08.705\nAnd it is showing some hits,\neven though we haven't done anything.\n\n340\n00:19:08.705 --> 00:19:10.642\nThat's probably from previous,\nwhich is fine.\n\n341\n00:19:10.642 --> 00:19:12.650\nSo then clear out this counter.\n\n342\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.590\nBut that's how she looks good.\n\n343\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.490\nNow let's do a show\n\n344\n00:19:24.518 --> 00:19:26.600\nrunning-config.\n\n345\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.840\nOops, too many run.\n\n346\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.388\nShow running-config here.\n\n347\n00:19:31.388 --> 00:19:34.370\nLet me zoom out just a little bit so\nthat we can see it a little better.\n\n348\n00:19:37.764 --> 00:19:38.680\nTry and zoom out.\n\n349\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.370\nWhat's wrong with my zoom?\n\n350\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.240\nThere it goes, good gracious.\n\n351\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.200\nLike trying to drag, pull teeth here.\n\n352\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.570\nI'm trying to get down to where do I see\nthe nat configurations just for a moment.\n\n353\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.210\nAnd there we go, okay.\n\n354\n00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.730\nSo, this is where you would\nverify your access control list\n\n355\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.570\nas well as the pool that you set up.\n\n356\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.620\nMake sure you verify that\nthe syntax is correct, okay?\n\n357\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.009\nSo if that's all good and\neverything is actually ready,\n\n358\n00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:13.903\nnow we're ready to try and verify and\nsee if this is working here.\n\n359\n00:20:13.903 --> 00:20:17.660\nNow, let's go back to\nour machine over here.\n\n360\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.797\nAnd we'll clear this out as well.\n\n361\n00:20:22.797 --> 00:20:28.376\nOops, I can't spell clear, there we go.\n\n362\n00:20:28.376 --> 00:20:35.210\nPing 172.140.2, we'll use the same ping,\nand we'll give it a moment.\n\n363\n00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.980\nLet's see what happens.\n\n364\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.179\nRequest timed out.\n\n365\n00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:50.246\nIt looks like it's actually\ngoing to time out, here.\n\n366\n00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:53.100\nSo now, let's check it out here.\n\n367\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.304\nLet's see if we can find\nout what's going on.\n\n368\n00:20:57.304 --> 00:21:01.728\nShow ip nat translations, and\n\n369\n00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:08.580\nnow we see something is not working,\nright?\n\n370\n00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.470\nSo the very fact that we have\nsomething like this, and\n\n371\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.230\nnow it actually says look, you're\nnot getting any translation through.\n\n372\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:20.070\nNow I can do a show, ip nat stat again.\n\n373\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.670\nAnd let's see,\nare we getting any misses, okay?\n\n374\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.150\nAnd we're not getting any misses, so\n\n375\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:29.020\nsomewhere along the line I have not\nconfigured something correctly, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.850\nSo this is where we have to again\ntake a look at some of our different\n\n377\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.390\nconfigurations here to make sure that\nwe've done what we needed to, all right?\n\n378\n00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.940\nSo that's what has to happen.\n\n379\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.650\nSo, I'm gonna use this scroll and\nmake sure that I check out the information\n\n380\n00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.650\nthat everything is correct in\nthe way that it's displaying.\n\n381\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.258\nAnd let me use this, and\nwe'll do this again, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:51.258 --> 00:21:55.940\nSo in our show run, that is correct,\n\n383\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.029\nip nat inside, ip nat outside.\n\n384\n00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:04.551\nAnd then our access list,\nwe created access-list 100.\n\n385\n00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:09.620\nWe're permitting everything,\nwhich is ip from the 16 network\n\n386\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.700\ngoing through 172.14 network,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n387\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.390\nNow, ip nat pool 172.14, 172.14, and\n\n388\n00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:25.390\nthat's the range here.\n\n389\n00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.960\nSo, I am missing something here.\n\n390\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.660\nSo can you tell what I'm actually\nmissing just from this information?\n\n391\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.230\nOkay, that is the key,\n\n392\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.110\nnow you might be wondering like what\nthe heck are you pointing out here?\n\n393\n00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.360\nWell there is clearly something\nI'm missing, so let's do this.\n\n394\n00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.978\nLet me show you this.\n\n395\n00:22:43.978 --> 00:22:47.299\nRemember what I said has to exist, right?\n\n396\n00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.740\nWe create an access list.\n\n397\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n398\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.830\nwe make sure that it was\non each interface, right?\n\n399\n00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.900\nWe showed you that.\n\n400\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.690\nWe also created that pool, right?\n\n401\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:01.340\nDid I create this line right here?\n\n402\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.324\nIp nat inside source list,\nwhatever it was, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:06.324 --> 00:23:09.524\nWell if I scroll through\nthe running configuration,\n\n404\n00:23:09.524 --> 00:23:11.950\nI don't have anything like that at all.\n\n405\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.970\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Anywhere, okay.\n\n406\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.000\nSo that's what happened, okay.\n\n407\n00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.980\nSo, if you don't know that\nthat's what's missing,\n\n408\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.700\nwell that's what we have to do is we now\nhave to actually configure that to work.\n\n409\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.800\nSo now, let's check it out here.\n\n410\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.160\nSo now inside of global configuration,\n\n411\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.070\nip nat inside source.\n\n412\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.310\nOops, I forgot to scroll.\n\n413\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.650\nMy apologies there.\n\n414\n00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.646\nInside source lists here, I'm referring\n\n415\n00:23:44.646 --> 00:23:49.501\nto list 100, and then on the outside,\n\n416\n00:23:49.501 --> 00:23:56.037\nit's gonna be pool called mydynamicpool,\nall right?\n\n417\n00:23:56.037 --> 00:24:03.537\nSo now, as I exit out of here,\nI do a show running-config.\n\n418\n00:24:03.537 --> 00:24:07.483\nAnd now let's take\na look as I hit enter or\n\n419\n00:24:07.483 --> 00:24:12.610\ntab here a few times and\nget down towards the bottom.\n\n420\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.950\nNow look at it.\n\n421\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.695\nI now see everything, right?\n\n422\n00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:21.660\nSo remember the three elements,\naccess control list, I have my pool.\n\n423\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.590\nI now have what binds\nthe access control list and\n\n424\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.370\nthe pool together also\nwritten right here too.\n\n425\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.910\nSo at this point,\nlet's try it one more time.\n\n426\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.030\nAnd now see if we can get through.\n\n427\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.870\nOkay, now we can't get through this time.\n\n428\n00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.880\nWe may have to kind of try\nsomething else as well.\n\n429\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.730\nAnd now there you go, look at that Zach.\n\n430\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.350\n&gt;&gt; You made it ping.\n\n431\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.603\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I now get pings\ngoing through as well, okay.\n\n432\n00:24:47.603 --> 00:24:50.944\nSo here, oops.\n\n433\n00:24:55.216 --> 00:24:59.146\nShow ip nat translations, and\n\n434\n00:24:59.146 --> 00:25:05.350\nnow we're starting to get those addresses.\n\n435\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.460\nNow it's very difficult for\nus in our lab setting right here.\n\n436\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.532\n&gt;&gt; Here you said translations,\nright buddy?\n\n437\n00:25:09.532 --> 00:25:11.930\n&gt;&gt; Yep, here it said translations.\n\n438\n00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.340\nSo it's very difficult though for\n\n439\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.180\nour lab because we don't have\na lot of devices set up.\n\n440\n00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.550\nBut the next one that we would\nhave if we had multiple devices,\n\n441\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.510\nlet me show you what\nthe output of that should be.\n\n442\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.796\nSo I forgot that should\nshow that over here, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:24.796 --> 00:25:29.950\nBut if IP nat pull is actually done,\nI actually built up my own lab and\n\n444\n00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.370\nmy own environment instead.\n\n445\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.210\nAnd now you'll actually see a couple of\ndifferent things as I scroll through here.\n\n446\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.280\nNotice that you're seeing\ndifferent IP addresses.\n\n447\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.358\nSo there you're actually seeing\nwhere it translated 14.0.1,\n\n448\n00:25:44.358 --> 00:25:50.760\nand now notice on this one 0.2, and\nthen down here at the bottom, 0.3 as well.\n\n449\n00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.840\nNow you're also seeing some unusual\nthings once we get to this point\n\n450\n00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.110\nin the dynamic translation as well.\n\n451\n00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:02.800\nNotice these numbers with a colon after\nthem too, these numbers as well, okay?\n\n452\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.990\nSo they're actually kinda skipping\naround and you're starting to see stuff,\n\n453\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.970\nbut the reason why is that\nwhen we issue pings, right?\n\n454\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.350\nThey all are individual in their\nconnection going through, okay?\n\n455\n00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.870\nAnd if they're individual in\ntheir connection going through,\n\n456\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.880\nthey have to return that same way.\n\n457\n00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.110\nSo this is how they distinguish\neven between individual pings\n\n458\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.960\nwhich pings are coming back.\n\n459\n00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why\n\n460\n00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.922\nthose numbers are different\nin what we're seeing, okay?\n\n461\n00:26:27.922 --> 00:26:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, the great thing is though Zach,\n\n462\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.670\nis that we now have the idea\nof Dynamic NAT set up for us.\n\n463\n00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We even showed\n\n464\n00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.660\nyou a bit of troubleshooting I\nalso showed you what was missing.\n\n465\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that could be another type of\n\n466\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:40.910\nquestion that you might see.\n\n467\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.980\nLike, why isn't the translation working?\n\n468\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.570\nWell, especially with Dynamic, right?\n\n469\n00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.040\nThose three elements have to be involved,\nokay?\n\n470\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.520\nSo Zach, this is a great place for\nus to end this episode, but we still have,\n\n471\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.360\nof course,\nport address translation to go, so\n\n472\n00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.760\nwe need to do that in\na third episode instead.\n\n473\n00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, as usual, Ronnie.\n\n474\n00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.470\nConfigure nat, part one and\ntwo, and soon, part three.\n\n475\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.550\nMake sure you see that and see everything\ninside the Cisco CSense series.\n\n476\n00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.650\nYou’ll be very glad did.\n\n477\n00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.250\nIt’s going to help you too, by the way.\n\n478\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.680\nAnd you’ll be in the course library.\n\n479\n00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.600\nThere’s thousands of other videos\nthere designed to do one thing,\n\n480\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.610\nhelp you go further.\n\n481\n00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.190\nSo check those out as well.\n\n482\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.380\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n483\n00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.560\nYou know ITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n484\n00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.440\nThanks for watching.\n\n485\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.160\nI'm Zach

00:00:08.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:13.118\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:15.968\nwatching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:20.507\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Cisco CCENT,\n\n7\n00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:25.350\nthis is Configure NAT Part 3,\nbecause you demanded it.\n\n8\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.007\nAnd the person bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n9\n00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.344\nonly Ronnie Wong, Ronnie,\ngreat to see you again, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.337\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, once again,\n\n11\n00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:32.640\nthank you for having me on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.835\nAs we continue on, taking a little bit of\na deeper dive into configuring NAT here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:40.689\nBecause, well, there is a lot of\ninformation that you have to know not only\n\n14\n00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:42.474\nfor preparing for the CCENT exam.\n\n15\n00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:46.747\nBut also because if there is anything for\nyou to configure and have to troubleshoot.\n\n16\n00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:50.770\nAnd that is one of the easiest\nones to just forget something.\n\n17\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.182\nBecause there are more moving parts to it,\nmore configuration that you have to make.\n\n18\n00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:58.974\nBut the great thing is, since we've\nconfigured at least those interfaces that\n\n19\n00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:00.628\nwe've done in parts 1 and 2.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n20\n00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:01.642\n&gt;&gt; We haven't had to touch them,\n\n21\n00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:02.805\nwhich is good.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n22\n00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:03.638\n&gt;&gt; But remember,\n\n23\n00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:06.890\nmake sure you verify those\nwhen you get onto the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.452\nMake sure those are actually\ncorrectly verified, and\n\n25\n00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:12.077\nthen the different components\nthat we've done so far.\n\n26\n00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:15.790\nSo, Zach, we've already gone over,\nof course, static NAT translations.\n\n27\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.273\nWe've talked about, of course,\nusing dynamic NAT translations.\n\n28\n00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:22.857\nStatic being one to one, NAT being a many\nto many translation, or a many to few,\n\n29\n00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:24.650\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n30\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.528\nIt allows us to do that, but\n\n31\n00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:31.289\nthe problem that we have still is\nthe existence of the issue, right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.181\nIs that regardless of which\nof those two that we did,\n\n33\n00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:37.750\nif more people inside need to be\nable to connect to the Internet.\n\n34\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.740\nOr need to be able to\nhave a public IP address,\n\n35\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.673\nwe still need to request\nmore IP addresses.\n\n36\n00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:47.082\nSo in both dynamic NAT\nas well as static NAT,\n\n37\n00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:51.890\nthat would still have to happen,\nso the technology changed.\n\n38\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.515\nNAT itself, network address translation,\n\n39\n00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:57.629\nadded in what they called\nport address translation.\n\n40\n00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.101\nTechnically, NAT overload in the CISCO\ncommunity is what you also tend to hear,\n\n41\n00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.029\nand what does that actually mean?\n\n42\n00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:08.762\nWell, that means we can overload\na single IP address, but\n\n43\n00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:14.090\nwith more than one connection in\nboth the dynamic and the static.\n\n44\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.915\nIt really is a one-to-one translation.\n\n45\n00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:18.629\nSo even though with the dynamic,\nI might have three or four,\n\n46\n00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.970\nthat allows me three or four.\n\n47\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.832\nBut it's really still one private IP\naddress to any one of those three or\n\n48\n00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.193\nfour public IP addresses, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:29.598\nSo but it's just dynamically handling it,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:32.341\nSo it doesn't have to be\nthe same three at any one time.\n\n51\n00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:38.710\nBut when we move on to the idea of port\naddress translation, or NAT overload.\n\n52\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.669\nThis allows me to take that entire pool\nof class C addresses that I was talking\n\n53\n00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.623\nabout that's within my local area network.\n\n54\n00:02:46.623 --> 00:02:51.257\nAnd then I can run them through the router\nand when it gets translated out,\n\n55\n00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:55.490\nit can get translated into\na single public IP address.\n\n56\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.589\nNow technically,\nthe way that this ends up working\n\n57\n00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:05.332\nis that we can actually have,\ntheoretically,\n\n58\n00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:09.968\none through 65,535 port connections.\n\n59\n00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:14.956\nNow when I start saying that,\nthat means I can have up to 65,000\n\n60\n00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:20.800\nadditional IP addresses connecting in,\nwell, not exactly, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.816\nWhen you make a connection, let's take,\nfor example, to a web server, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:30.052\nThat means your IP address is getting\ntranslated, but when we're using ports,\n\n63\n00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:34.350\nit could use, let's say, 4 or\n5, or 20 of those ports.\n\n64\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.882\nSo when you start doing that, and\n\n65\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.353\nthen a single machine has multiple\napplications that are connecting out.\n\n66\n00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:44.267\nA single machine might actually\ntake up to 100, or maybe even,\n\n67\n00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:47.870\nlet's say, low end, 50, or 20 or so.\n\n68\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.838\nAll the way up to, let's say, 150, maybe\neven 200 ports, and now, all of a sudden,\n\n69\n00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:55.405\nyou start doing that with 254 connections.\n\n70\n00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:59.336\nAnd some of the computers,\nof course, depending on who you are,\n\n71\n00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:02.490\nyou might actually take\nup even more of those.\n\n72\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.400\nSo the realistic IP addresses\nin terms of numbers,\n\n73\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.438\nit starts going down very rapidly.\n\n74\n00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:12.061\nWhen you realize that your own single\ninternal IP address could take up hundreds\n\n75\n00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:14.496\nof those port numbers very quickly.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n76\n00:04:14.496 --> 00:04:15.434\n&gt;&gt; So all of a sudden,\n\n77\n00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:18.960\nit's not 65,000 additional addresses,\nif you think about it,\n\n78\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.070\nit's actually 65,000\ndifferent connections.\n\n79\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.861\nThat is what we are talking\nabout at any one time, and\n\n80\n00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:27.468\nyour machine is not just\nmaking one connection.\n\n81\n00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:31.500\nYou might be connected to a web server,\nyou might connected to an email server.\n\n82\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.731\nYou might be connected to a remote\nstorage, like Dropbox, or OneDrive, or\n\n83\n00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:36.667\nwhatever it is.\n\n84\n00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.083\nAll those could take multiple\nconnections to make and there it is,\n\n85\n00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:43.460\nyou're just sitting there on\nyour Internet connection.\n\n86\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.710\nAnd you're just using that\nsingle public IP address, and\n\n87\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.699\nso is Zach, so am I, we're all using it,\nbut it's not going to be 65,000 of them.\n\n88\n00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.020\nSo even though there are possibilities of\nthat, you're not going to see that, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.341\nSo when you start to do\nsomething like this,\n\n90\n00:04:58.341 --> 00:05:01.680\nwe're going to configure that\ninside of our lab environment.\n\n91\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.668\nBut let's take a look at my diagram so\n\n92\n00:05:03.668 --> 00:05:06.840\nthat we understand what\nthe elements are involved.\n\n93\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.731\nSo notice I've not really changed\nthe diagram too much at this point.\n\n94\n00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:13.678\nBut we still have to configure,\nof course, the interfaces and\n\n95\n00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:16.075\nwe need to verify and\nmake sure that those are good.\n\n96\n00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:19.290\nBut then when we go into this,\nthis is actually a bit easier.\n\n97\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.059\nI can just create a standard access\ncontrol list, just like I've done before.\n\n98\n00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:28.950\nI could even reuse the one that I did,\nif I already had one done earlier, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.786\nSo as long as I have that, I'm fine.\n\n100\n00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:37.630\nAnd now, I have to create something that\nactually allows me to attach the list.\n\n101\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.046\nInstead of actually attaching it\nto a single IP address as well,\n\n102\n00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:45.166\nor to a pool of anything.\n\n103\n00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:48.550\nWhat I tell it to do is\nattach it to an interface.\n\n104\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.146\nAnd when I tell it to\nattach it to an interface,\n\n105\n00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:54.484\nit's going to have an IP address\non that interface, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:54.484 --> 00:05:58.363\nBut the key word is right here\nthat you definitely do not want\n\n107\n00:05:58.363 --> 00:05:59.357\nto miss.\n&gt;&gt; The overload.\n\n108\n00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:02.270\n&gt;&gt; Which is the word, overload, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.684\nIf you are not getting translations,\n\n110\n00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:08.920\nwhere every device that is connecting\nto it is not working, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.830\nYou probably have forgotten the key word,\noverload.\n\n112\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.235\nSo this why you'll hear the term NAT\noverload and PAT or Port Address\n\n113\n00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:19.280\nTranslation used interchangeably, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.557\n&gt;&gt; And when you take a look once\n\n115\n00:06:20.557 --> 00:06:22.401\neverything is configured correctly.\n\n116\n00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:26.213\nYou'll notice that everything has\na port number assigned to it, and\n\n117\n00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:29.577\nyou'll see there's those port\nnumbers right here, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:29.577 --> 00:06:31.370\nSo that's actually a sign.\n\n119\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.842\nSo on my own internal lab that I\nactually built up, I used a TCP,\n\n120\n00:06:36.842 --> 00:06:43.262\nor actually I just did a connection\nwith Telnet, or something like that.\n\n121\n00:06:43.262 --> 00:06:47.454\nAnd when I did that, you can see where\nit actually went to a web server,\n\n122\n00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:49.814\nI'm lying to you, so I just used HTTP.\n\n123\n00:06:49.814 --> 00:06:54.300\nAnd you can see we're connected to port 80\nand then the port numbers that came back.\n\n124\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.136\nAll right, so that's what you're seeing,\n\n125\n00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:58.130\nare these different translations here,\nokay?\n\n126\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.113\nSo remember that we have\ndestination port numbers.\n\n127\n00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:03.217\nAnd that's how I could tell I was\nactually using a web server instead,\n\n128\n00:07:03.217 --> 00:07:04.837\nis that port 80 that we have.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n129\n00:07:04.837 --> 00:07:06.245\n&gt;&gt; And each one of these is\n\n130\n00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:09.150\nstill the same IP address connection.\n\n131\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.329\nBut now notice that if I\nhad more than one, again,\n\n132\n00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:14.615\nyou'd still see the inside local.\n\n133\n00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:18.039\nAnd then the inside global address\nwould still be that one, but\n\n134\n00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.160\nwith more port numbers would actually\nbe attached to that only one.\n\n135\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.604\nSo that's why we can overload a single\nIP address to be able to do this.\n\n136\n00:07:26.604 --> 00:07:27.975\nSo the great thing is,\n\n137\n00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:32.650\nthis configuration is not difficult\nby any comparison to what we have.\n\n138\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.687\nNow, before we start this lab.\n\n139\n00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:40.483\nI also went ahead and cleared out\nour dynamic port translation that we\n\n140\n00:07:40.483 --> 00:07:44.037\nwere doing just a little\nbit earlier in our part 2,\n\n141\n00:07:44.037 --> 00:07:44.879\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n142\n00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.705\n&gt;&gt; So I did a no ip\n\n143\n00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:48.960\nnat inside source list, and then the pool.\n\n144\n00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.355\nAnd it also asked me for a question and\nsaid, hey, dynamic mappings are in use,\n\n145\n00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.249\nare you sure you want\nto delete the entries?\n\n146\n00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:58.678\nAnd I answered yes And then I verified\nit by doing a show ip nat trans to\n\n147\n00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:02.429\nmake sure that I have no\ntranslations going on right now.\n\n148\n00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:07.867\nSo that I can do our next part here,\nin making sure that we do the dynamic,\n\n149\n00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:12.170\nor the port address translations instead.\n\n150\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.090\nSo this is by far the most common\nimplementation of what we're going to end\n\n151\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.180\nup having to see here, or\nconfigure, if we're asked to do so.\n\n152\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.860\nSo let's go ahead and do this, let's go\ninto our global configuration terminal.\n\n153\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.602\nAnd once we're here, we're gonna start\noff by creating an access-list, and\n\n154\n00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:34.242\nthis one, they also have us doing a, okay.\n\n155\n00:08:34.242 --> 00:08:37.026\nThey have us doing an extended\naccess list again,\n\n156\n00:08:37.026 --> 00:08:39.820\nso we'll do access-list here 101, permit.\n\n157\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.850\nIp, and then same thing, 192.168.16.0,\n\n158\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.640\nand then a 24 bit wild card mask, and\n\n159\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.430\nthen I'm gonna tell it\nto go to any address.\n\n160\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.020\nSo I'm not worried about\nlimiting it to one network,\n\n161\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.490\nI'm telling it to any address here.\n\n162\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.770\nSo we can actually use both, but\n\n163\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.480\nthis one they have us using of\ncourse any as our destination.\n\n164\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.360\nNow that I have that,\nI have that access list,\n\n165\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.270\nI am going to be combining it with\nthe interface that faces, essentially,\n\n166\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.240\nthe Internet, at least the virtual\nInternet for you and me.\n\n167\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.868\nSo all we have to do, once we get this,\n\n168\n00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:29.484\nis now I need ip nat inside, so\n\n169\n00:09:29.484 --> 00:09:33.992\nI'm defining the inside, source.\n\n170\n00:09:33.992 --> 00:09:39.342\nAnd this is gonna be list 101 to\n\n171\n00:09:39.342 --> 00:09:46.032\nthe interface gigabitethernet 0/1,\n\n172\n00:09:46.032 --> 00:09:51.200\nlet's do a question mark here.\n\n173\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.380\nAnd that is the keyword we\nare looking for, which is overload.\n\n174\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.310\nYou forget the overload,\nit is not going to work, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.240\nSo make sure you know that, okay, so\nget that configuration correct there.\n\n176\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:14.850\nAnd on this one, overload,\nnow we've got that in there.\n\n177\n00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.700\nNow we are ready to check out some of\nthe information again and verify and\n\n178\n00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.880\nsee whether or not things are working.\n\n179\n00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.080\nSo I haven't done anything, so I shouldn't\nsee too much in show ip nat translations.\n\n180\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.320\nOkay, so that's fine, and\nwe'll verify it here in a moment.\n\n181\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.404\nShould I actually see anything\nif I do a show ip nat stat.\n\n182\n00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:43.990\nThat's the ending that actually\nshows up at this point.\n\n183\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.345\nWell, I'm starting to see a little bit\nmore information that I haven't seen\n\n184\n00:10:48.345 --> 00:10:49.287\nbefore, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:49.287 --> 00:10:52.539\nI can still verify\nthe information that I need to,\n\n186\n00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:58.170\nthere were hits from the previous\nconfiguration that we did, which is fine.\n\n187\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.048\nBut now notice it actually does show me at\nleast the inside source list right now,\n\n188\n00:11:03.048 --> 00:11:04.708\nso that's actually good.\n\n189\n00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:08.724\nI haven't done anything, so\neverything looks good at this point.\n\n190\n00:11:08.724 --> 00:11:12.930\nThe other thing that I would check,\nof course,\n\n191\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.960\nis gonna be the running\nconfiguration here.\n\n192\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.271\nI just wanna verify that the information\nespecially on those interfaces is correct,\n\n193\n00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:25.015\nwhich I already verified through that one.\n\n194\n00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:31.980\nBut if I'm not exactly sure,\nThis is what we're looking for.\n\n195\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.650\nOnce again, is the inside and\nthe outside correct, or\n\n196\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.310\nis it switched backwards,\nthat is a big one, or is it missing?\n\n197\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.090\nThose are usually kind of\nthe big ones that get you.\n\n198\n00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:51.660\nI don't know why, but apparently, it just\ndoesn't like me trying to scroll quickly.\n\n199\n00:11:56.926 --> 00:12:01.569\nAnd so here we have, look at that,\nthe dynamic nat pool is still there,\n\n200\n00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:02.960\nwhich is fine, okay.\n\n201\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.980\nThe reason why this doesn't bother us,\nright,\n\n202\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.680\nis because it's not actually\nwhat linked up to anything else.\n\n203\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.328\nOkay, so right now,\nwe're missing that one that actually ties\n\n204\n00:12:14.328 --> 00:12:18.648\nthe dynamic pool to the access\nlist 100 that we created.\n\n205\n00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:20.795\nSo we're not worried about this,\nit's not actually doing anything,\n\n206\n00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:22.070\nit's just sitting there.\n\n207\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.980\nIdeally, we of course would remove that,\nbut for right now,\n\n208\n00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.770\nit's not gonna bother anything.\n\n209\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.184\nI'm looking at the one I just configured,\nand I, again,\n\n210\n00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:33.752\nwant to verify that I have\nthe keyword overload right there.\n\n211\n00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:37.520\nThat the access list that I\ncreated is fine, and it is.\n\n212\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.670\nSo I wanna verify,\neasy enough to just simply mistype in a 0,\n\n213\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.780\nespecially with those wild card masks if\nyou choose to do an extended access list.\n\n214\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.290\nSo just be aware, or\neven a standard access list,\n\n215\n00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.390\nmake sure that you pay attention.\n\n216\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:58.081\nRemember that a wild card\nmask looks similar to\n\n217\n00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:02.420\nthe inverse of a subnet\nmask a lot of times.\n\n218\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.550\nBut it may not always be that way as well,\n\n219\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.420\nso just kinda verify that\nyou have everything there.\n\n220\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.240\nAnd if all of that is working so far, and\n\n221\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.760\nall of that looks good,\nthen we can verify.\n\n222\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.260\nAnd then from that point, we'll have to do\nsome more troubleshooting if we need to.\n\n223\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.186\nSo let me see if I can\nconnect that device again.\n\n224\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.710\nAnd let's see,\nwho are we pinging this time?\n\n225\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.586\nMake sure, okay,\nit actually doesn't say ping.\n\n226\n00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:36.490\nIt says use the browser this time,\nlet's try and use this browser,\n\n227\n00:13:39.103 --> 00:13:44.067\nAnd on the browser, I'm going to\n\n228\n00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:49.180\nwww.practice-labs.com.\n\n229\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.085\nNow this is not really on the internet,\n\n230\n00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:55.153\nthis is actually their internal server\nthat's acting like it's on the Internet.\n\n231\n00:13:55.153 --> 00:13:58.945\nSo the great thing is, congratulations,\nyou're connected to the web server,\n\n232\n00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:02.770\nthat's great, and what it actually\nallows us to be able to do.\n\n233\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:08.338\nSo once I see something like that,\nlet's go back over to NYEDGE1,\n\n234\n00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:17.760\nshow ip nat translations, and here we go.\n\n235\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.700\nSo now you're actually seeing\nthe individual connections go out.\n\n236\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.580\nYou're seeing that each one of\nthose connections are being made.\n\n237\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.490\nIt is translating it directly too the 101,\nokay.\n\n238\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.470\nIt doesn't have to go to another one,\nit's actually able to feed all that and\n\n239\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.330\nhandle it dynamically for us.\n\n240\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.150\nEven when multiple inside\nlocal addresses are coming in.\n\n241\n00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.890\nIt will still all get translated to\nthat one single address as well.\n\n242\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.708\nSo that's what we're actually taking\na look at, and that is by far the most\n\n243\n00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:53.800\nconfigure that you end up using and\nthat you end up seeing too.\n\n244\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.290\nThere's one last thing they wanna show\nyou in terms of dealing with NAT as well.\n\n245\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.910\nLet's say you do a show ip nat trans,\nit doesn't work.\n\n246\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.180\nYou take a look at the statistics and\nit doesn't work.\n\n247\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.210\nWell, what do you start doing\nif all that doesn't work here?\n\n248\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.140\nWe've already used one of\nthem to make sure, right?\n\n249\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:22.240\nYou clear out, make sure here,\nip nat translation and an asterisk.\n\n250\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.370\nMaking sure that you clear those out and\nthen you run your test again.\n\n251\n00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.520\nVerifying that this is\nnot old information, but\n\n252\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.710\nthis is new information that comes\nthrough if we wanted to actually do that.\n\n253\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.790\nSo you'd come back over here and\ngo, is this cached or\n\n254\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.620\nis this something new, run it again.\n\n255\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.738\nAnd now,\nif I do the show ip nat translations,\n\n256\n00:15:42.738 --> 00:15:50.355\nnotice it actually brought it up and brand\nnew after clearing everything out, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:50.355 --> 00:15:54.223\nAnd you can also see the port\nnumbers are different.\n\n258\n00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:57.119\nSo you know that this is a newly\nestablished connection and\n\n259\n00:15:57.119 --> 00:16:00.560\nthat nat is actually working for\nwhat you want to do.\n\n260\n00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.930\nThe other thing you can do and\n\n261\n00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.150\nif you do this you only want\nto do it temporarily, okay?\n\n262\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.870\nIf you're not sure that's\nworking correctly or\n\n263\n00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:13.430\nyou can't get this done, what you can\ndo is do what's called a debug command.\n\n264\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:18.310\nNow we haven't worked much with debugs\nhere but it literally is the term debug.\n\n265\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.680\nDebug for what you and I actually\nend up seeing is all the background\n\n266\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.080\nlogging messages that they just\ndon't show up on the screen, but\n\n267\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.260\nwhen we type in debug we're saying go and\nshow me all those additional messages.\n\n268\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.510\nSome of them will mean something, some of\nthem will not mean anything to you and me.\n\n269\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.740\nBut this is something else\nwe can do here too, okay?\n\n270\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:48.160\nSo if I do a debug ip nat, let's do\na question mark here before we move on.\n\n271\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.130\nNotice that there is a ton of\ndifferent things that I can debug.\n\n272\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:57.010\nI can debug the access list if I choose\nto, it should show me what I want as well.\n\n273\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:03.690\nI can do a lot but what I'm looking for\nis probably one of these two, right?\n\n274\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.130\nThe errors and of course the word detail.\n\n275\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.490\nIf I suspect that there is an error,\nfinding what that event is is probably\n\n276\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.120\ngonna help me to do a little bit\nmore research and figure that out.\n\n277\n00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.760\nBut detailed is probably the one\nthat I want for this time.\n\n278\n00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.000\nIf I can actually control this\na little bit better, there we go.\n\n279\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.510\nSo now notice you're starting\nto see the translations here and\n\n280\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:32.460\nit's showing you everything that's\nhappened in that as it comes across.\n\n281\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.450\nTCP and\nyou're seeing the destination port number\n\n282\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.230\nchange into another port number as well.\n\n283\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.600\nSource address, destination address, and\n\n284\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.430\nthis is the return traffic coming back\nin is what you're seeing at this point.\n\n285\n00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.350\nSo you can of course see\na timestamp that's going across.\n\n286\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.950\nNetwork address translation\nthat's being used.\n\n287\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.461\nAnd Zach as I start to take\na look at something like this,\n\n288\n00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:59.247\nthat's a lot of information [CROSSTALK]\nwhere it's filled up the screen very\n\n289\n00:17:59.247 --> 00:18:02.261\nquickly by just turning on debug ip nat,\nokay?\n\n290\n00:18:02.261 --> 00:18:05.805\nSo normally what you do is\nafter you do your debugging,\n\n291\n00:18:05.805 --> 00:18:08.578\nyou find out some errors and information,\n\n292\n00:18:08.578 --> 00:18:13.860\nyou do a undebug which is the hard\nthing to actually remember, undebug.\n\n293\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.960\nAnd I just do an all,\nlike turn off all debugging.\n\n294\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.930\nYou can really end up\noverwhelming your router or\n\n295\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.570\nyour switch here if you actually\ndo like a debug all command.\n\n296\n00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.920\nNever do that on a production machine\nunless you're willing to accept\n\n297\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.780\nthe consequences,\nwhich may mean you having to quit.\n\n298\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.062\nOr going somewhere else, or being fired.\n\n299\n00:18:35.062 --> 00:18:38.753\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] So be careful,\nthis can really damage a switch, so\n\n300\n00:18:38.753 --> 00:18:42.786\nyou gotta be careful here, or a router,\nwhen you do something like this.\n\n301\n00:18:42.786 --> 00:18:44.212\nSo now that we see that, and\n\n302\n00:18:44.212 --> 00:18:47.080\nwe can understand that\nthere's a few things there.\n\n303\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.200\nWe've pointed out the most important\nelements in troubleshooting as well.\n\n304\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.600\nLike I said, the key on that, probably if\nanything is misconfigured, is forgetting\n\n305\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.480\nto put the inside outside on the right\ninterfaces or switching them around.\n\n306\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.680\nThat's usually a key element to it.\n\n307\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.840\nOr like we did with the dynamic pull,\nwhere I got two out of the three elements.\n\n308\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.180\nI didn't get all three of the elements or\nwith path.\n\n309\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.210\nWe're getting the word overload\nis actually key as well.\n\n310\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.900\nOkay, but in the static one if anything\nthat was probably the easiest to\n\n311\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.220\nactually remember because you're\nonly doing one IP address.\n\n312\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.272\nBut you're actually\ntaking a look at it and\n\n313\n00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:28.723\nyou're going to make that\ntranslation manually so\n\n314\n00:19:28.723 --> 00:19:32.324\nthat's probably the one that will kinda\nbe easier for you to work through.\n\n315\n00:19:32.324 --> 00:19:35.107\nTake a look at these commands\nthat will help show and\n\n316\n00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:39.183\nclear out the table for you, and you'll\nsee as they come back through if you\n\n317\n00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:42.614\nare actually getting the information\nit's gonna be working,\n\n318\n00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:46.240\nso nat is a very prevalent\ntechnology in today's networks.\n\n319\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.510\nAs we move to IP version six, you'll\nprobably see it disappear more and more.\n\n320\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.750\nBut at this point, Zach, we've configured\ndynamic, we've configured static,\n\n321\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.660\nwe've configured port address\ntranslation or net overload.\n\n322\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.160\nEverything is done at this point\nin terms of configuring nat but\n\n323\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.210\nit doesn't mean that there's all that\nthere is to this but at least for the CCNT\n\n324\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:10.240\nhere, that's enough to get you started and\nto get you prepared as we move on to\n\n325\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.220\nthe CCNA routing and switching exam two.\n&gt;&gt; Very well done, Ronnie.\n\n326\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.390\nAnd that's configure nats Part one,\ntwo, and three.\n\n327\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.220\nI may say that again.\n\n328\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.420\nConfigure nat part one,\ntwo, and three, not gnats.\n\n329\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.520\nForgive me for that.\n\n330\n00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.616\nBefore we move on,\nRonnie anything else you'd like to say?\n\n331\n00:20:24.616 --> 00:20:27.160\nWell once again, practice is the key.\n\n332\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.530\nSo because this topic is\na little bit more detailed and\n\n333\n00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.760\nall the configurations that we have\nto do cuz it is a lot of setup.\n\n334\n00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.290\nMake sure you do not move on from\nthis topic until you understand\n\n335\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.760\nthe elements of it that we've\ntalked about here, okay?\n\n336\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.360\nAnd the only way to do\nthat is by practicing,\n\n337\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.640\nby configuring, getting it wrong,\ntroubleshooting.\n\n338\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.960\nAnd then, reconfiguring it again, and\nthen going, this is where I messed up.\n\n339\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.460\nAnd once you get that down,\nit will be much easier for\n\n340\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.620\nyou learning from those\nmistakes is a valuable part\n\n341\n00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.660\nof what will help you out as\nyou get ready for the exam.\n\n342\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.010\nBut even if it takes you\na little bit extra time and\n\n343\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.270\nyou've already got everything planned out,\nmake sure you take the time to do this\n\n344\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.280\nalong with those axis control lists that\nwe talked about in previous episodes.\n\n345\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.000\nThese are two of the more unfamiliar\nconcepts that you'll run into.\n\n346\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.690\nAs well as the ones that have a much\nmore difficult configuration.\n\n347\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.260\nPay attention to them as well.\n\n348\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.910\nGreat advice Ronnie, and a great job\nwith Cisco CCENT, wonderful series.\n\n349\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.290\nWatch every episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n350\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.900\nAnd you'll be in the course library where\nthere's a whole bunch of other videos and\n\n351\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.150\nthey're there to help you go further,\ncheck those out too.\n\n352\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.940\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n353\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.420\nYou know IT Pro TV is binge worthy.\n\n354\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.690\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n355\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.194\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n356\n00:21:43.194 --> 00:21:49.303\n[MUSIC]\n\n357\n00:21:49.303 --> 00:21:52.403\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

San Fransisco\n\n3\n00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.622\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:13.942\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:16.430\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.690\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.479\nAs we continue on with Cisco CCENT.\n\n8\n00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:23.310\nWe're gonna be implementing device\nmonitoring in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.730\nAnd the one and only Ronnie Wong\nis here to do that for us.\n\n10\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.270\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach thank you for helping me\nas we continue on our journey here\n\n12\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.750\nthrough getting prepared for\nour CISCO CCENT exam.\n\n13\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.630\nWe're in our final topic where we are now\ntalking about infrastructure maintenance.\n\n14\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.560\nAnd we're gonna begin of course well\nwith taking a look at the idea of\n\n15\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.100\ndevice monitoring and\n\n16\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.330\nmaking sure that we can implement the\nthings that we can do in device monitor.\n\n17\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.720\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of monitoring these devices.\n\n18\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.670\nAre we really just talking about the,\n\n19\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.960\nlooking at what the command\nline looks like?\n\n20\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010\nWell not exactly because a lot of\ntimes it doesn't really show anything.\n\n21\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.040\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n22\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.430\nSo right here we're gonna take\na look at our practice lab just for\n\n23\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.605\na moment and\nmake sure I can get access in.\n\n24\n00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:14.260\nLet me zoom in,\nwell there is really not a lot to show.\n\n25\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.660\nSo if I leave this alone.\n\n26\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.060\nLong enough here.\n\n27\n00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.980\nBelieve it or\nnot it will just stay this way.\n\n28\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.690\nAnd there's not a lot that\nlooks like it's going on.\n\n29\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.770\nBut if this device is connected to\na network, there are things going on.\n\n30\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.160\nIf it's a router it's routing traffic.\n\n31\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.610\nBecause the switch is\nactually switching traffic.\n\n32\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.470\nBut we also see every once in a while\nmessages will of course pop forward.\n\n33\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.790\nSo let me see if I can do something here.\n\n34\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.200\nIf I go into configuration terminal.\n\n35\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.648\nWell now notice it's starting to actually\nsend some information back and forth.\n\n36\n00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:47.537\nAnd if I exit out of that, sometimes you\nalso get a message that pulls up, and\n\n37\n00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:48.045\nthere we go.\n\n38\n00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.290\nThat's what I was hoping to see, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.300\nSo I configured from the console,\nby the console.\n\n40\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.010\nWell these are the messages that\nwe're talking about here, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.608\nBecause they indicate what is\nactually happening on that device.\n\n42\n00:01:59.608 --> 00:02:01.584\nWhether it's a router or switch,\n\n43\n00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:04.659\nthis is the stuff that we're\nactually having to see.\n\n44\n00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.611\nAnd a lot of times this is actually good\ninformation that we need to review and\n\n45\n00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:10.820\nthat we might need to take a look at.\n\n46\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.370\n&gt;&gt; So this is real time, right?\n\n47\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.590\nWe're not looking at history or\ncan we look at history?\n\n48\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can and that's what\nwe're also talking about as well.\n\n49\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.010\nThe idea of doing real time analysis,\nin terms of what we're doing.\n\n50\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.030\nIt can be helpful but the problem is it's\nonly helpful for that moment in time.\n\n51\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.750\nSo as long as you catch\nit while it's happening,\n\n52\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.930\nit can save you some time when you're\ntrying to do troubleshooting, when you're\n\n53\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.620\ntrying to take a look here at the idea\nof maintenance and trying to do things.\n\n54\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.450\nBut the reality is,\n\n55\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.370\nwhat we wanna see is something that's\na little bit more over a historical time.\n\n56\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.660\nIn other words, after a period of time,\nafter a series of events is what we want.\n\n57\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.940\nBecause then we can spot trending.\n\n58\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.150\nWe can spot, a lot of times,\nhow long something has been happening or\n\n59\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.400\noccurring, and\nhow often something has been occurring.\n\n60\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.525\nBut if we only look at it in real time,\nit means we can't spot any of that.\n\n61\n00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:04.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n62\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.530\n&gt;&gt; So the messages that we're seeing\nright here, okay for example,\n\n63\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.320\nsuch as this message, Zach.\n\n64\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.330\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Is technically what we call a syslog\n\n65\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.010\nmessage.\n\n66\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; S-Y-S-L-O-G, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.090\nThose are the messages that\nwe are generally seeing.\n\n68\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.070\nNow by default on the Cisco devices,\n\n69\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.570\nit ends up getting reported\nin two places here, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.890\nOne is a historical buffer, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.750\nIn other words, there's a buffer which\nis just a small amount of RAM that is\n\n72\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.950\non the router or the switch.\n\n73\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.650\nIt says here's how much space I'm\nsetting aside for syslog messages.\n\n74\n00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.433\nWhen it does so it allows you then\nto pull up those messages and\n\n75\n00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:40.810\nto be able to see them as well.\n\n76\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.240\nBut the other place is what we're\nseeing right here on the screen.\n\n77\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.640\nSo, this is what is\ncalled a Console Access.\n\n78\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.975\nSo, notice where it says configured\nfrom console, by a console.\n\n79\n00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:56.400\nAnd that was just me entering\nin information from the console.\n\n80\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.420\nAnd the console is reporting it back out.\n\n81\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.260\nSo by default syslog messages end up\ngoing to the buffer on a device and\n\n82\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.010\nalso end up reporting out to the console.\n\n83\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.698\nNow when that buffer fills up one of\nthe earliest syslog messages, of course\n\n84\n00:04:12.698 --> 00:04:18.320\nyou empty that out to make room for the\nnew syslog messages that may be appearing.\n\n85\n00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.510\nSo these buffers,\nit really does just depend on each device,\n\n86\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.190\nhow big that they are, and how many lines\nof information that they can store.\n\n87\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.220\nNow sometimes when you actually do hear\nabout the idea of the buffer size,\n\n88\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.920\nI don't know if I can actually\nshow the buffer size here.\n\n89\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.740\nLet me see if I can actually do that.\n\n90\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.180\nI gotta remember if, because not every\nsingle machine actually does this.\n\n91\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.960\nLet me see if I can get that here, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.640\nAll right, so I was trying to look for,\nif there was actually just kind of\n\n93\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.430\nthe generic in terms of just a single\nbuffer size that I can find here.\n\n94\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.250\nBut I'm actually starting to see a little,\nI wonder these buffer pulls.\n\n95\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.670\nLet me see if I scroll\nup here a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.920\nThis might be part of what we see there.\n\n97\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.750\nA little bit of the free list 345 and\nfree which means in free memory.\n\n98\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.870\nAnd then I'm not seeing\nexactly what I was looking for\n\n99\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.380\nbut I was hoping to see something.\n\n100\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.910\nI don't know, normal buffers.\n\n101\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.050\nThere we go, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.103\nSo there is some information.\n\n103\n00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:25.314\nSo in terms of bytes of information,\nright now it says 1676 and\n\n104\n00:05:25.314 --> 00:05:28.500\nnotice that the total\nis about double that.\n\n105\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.990\nAnd that's actually part\nof the permanent buffer.\n\n106\n00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.170\nIf you take a look at that and\nround up, that's about four megs,\n\n107\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.190\nmaybe, in size or 4,000 kilobits.\n\n108\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.400\nWhatever it might be, I don't remember\nthe exact size that it's reported in.\n\n109\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.930\nSo if it was bytes,\nit would be about four kilobytes, right.\n\n110\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.321\n3000, yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.710\n3840 kilobytes, so as we see this.\n\n112\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.870\n&gt;&gt; Is there a maximum amount\nthat it would reach and\n\n113\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.413\nat that point it would just\nstart regenerating itself?\n\n114\n00:05:55.413 --> 00:05:58.660\n&gt;&gt; No, the neat thing is just\nas you asked, there you go.\n\n115\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.912\nSo right here.\n\n116\n00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:04.190\nYou're actually seeing that there is a\nmaximum number that we can reach here now.\n\n117\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.810\nWhat happens is that it doesn't\nregenerate but it freeze it up, right?\n\n118\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.613\nSo once it gets to that point, it will\ncontinue to free up older things that get\n\n119\n00:06:12.613 --> 00:06:13.280\n&gt;&gt; It will erase it.\n\n120\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then give you that space.\n\n121\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.510\nBut there you go.\n\n122\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.150\nAnd it doesn't sound like\na big amount of space, right?\n\n123\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.289\n4k is what we're talking,\n4000 kilobytes is the size, and\n\n124\n00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.159\nyou might be saying\nthat's not a lot of room.\n\n125\n00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.487\nThere's files that I generate that\nare larger than 4k just by generating them\n\n126\n00:06:32.487 --> 00:06:33.349\na lot of times.\n\n127\n00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.507\nSo 4k doesn't sound like a lot but\n\n128\n00:06:35.507 --> 00:06:40.900\nwhen you take a look at the information\nthat we're normally storing.\n\n129\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.200\nSo for instance, each one of these,\na line like this.\n\n130\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.000\nWell, that may not take up\nan entire kilobyte itself.\n\n131\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's not that it's but\n\n132\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.100\nso you can actually store a lot.\n\n133\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.690\nSo, for example,\nI think that if you were you to take like\n\n134\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.432\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica and turn it\ninto text which is all this is, right?\n\n135\n00:07:00.432 --> 00:07:03.147\nEssentially letters and\nnumbers and different characters.\n\n136\n00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:07.063\nAnd [INAUDIBLE] I think it's less than 10\nmegabytes if you would just take out all\n\n137\n00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:10.011\nthe pictures and everything and\njust store the text itself.\n\n138\n00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.081\nIt's something that's relatively small.\n\n139\n00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:19.230\nSo a 4 kilobyte buffer size doesn't\nsound huge but it's normally enough.\n\n140\n00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.116\nNow people always ask can you change the\nbuffer size, yes we're actually gonna be\n\n141\n00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:26.399\nchanging the buffer size for logging,\nto expand it out a little bit.\n\n142\n00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:31.650\nBut before you decide hey let's change\nthis and max it all up here, and do that.\n\n143\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.990\nRemember that any time you're taking away\nthe idea of actually increasing the buffer\n\n144\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.130\nsize somewhere.\n\n145\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.835\nYou're also gonna be taking away\nmemory from some other place too.\n\n146\n00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:41.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n147\n00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.230\nit will reduce maybe and then the amount\nof memory used for something else.\n\n148\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.964\nSo there is no magical way to continue to\nadd in something without taking away from\n\n149\n00:07:49.964 --> 00:07:51.019\nsome place else.\n\n150\n00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.833\nSo that's what we wanna make\nsure that we get across as well.\n\n151\n00:07:53.833 --> 00:07:55.883\nSo the buffer size is adjustable.\n\n152\n00:07:55.883 --> 00:07:58.209\nIt does allow us to do this, and\n\n153\n00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:03.318\nwe are saving it right now on this\nparticular N Y edge router, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:07.312\nSo, it's a good thing to actually have\nbecause we know that can be recorded out,\n\n155\n00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:08.810\nit can be doing this.\n\n156\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.360\nNow, the issue though, okay, as we start\ndoing it, we're only on this one, right?\n\n157\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.490\nOnly storing and that's perfectly fine but\nZach what happens now.\n\n158\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.254\nWhen I actually start to let's say,\nhave multiple routers on my network,\n\n159\n00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:28.610\nokay, well now, if I were to do this\nthat means I'd have to go round and\n\n160\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.530\ncheck every single one\nof these routers for\n\n161\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.850\ntheir buffer messages and\nstuff like that, that sounds like\n\n162\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.340\na management nightmare to me, right,\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a management\n\n163\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.090\nnightmare, yes.\n\n164\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.770\n&gt;&gt; Because why?\n\n165\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.950\nYou're having to go round to every\nsingle one of those routers and then now\n\n166\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.420\nyou're having to see what the messages\nare, you're having to pull up the console,\n\n167\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.160\nyou're having to do that, is it,\nare all the devices actually in some\n\n168\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.560\ntype of distress or something, you are\nhaving to find all that information out,\n\n169\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.800\nokay because we are storing them only\non their own individual buffers.\n\n170\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.520\nSo instead,\nwhat might be more practical idea is,\n\n171\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.356\ninstead of actually just using the buffer\nis to instead have all of our messages\n\n172\n00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:17.050\nreally set let's say down through here,\nso that when we do so,\n\n173\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.100\nit all ends up getting stored in a single\nlocation that we call syslog server.\n\n174\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.240\nAnd now, all of our devices can\nactually send it to a managed and\n\n175\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.330\na systematic way, as well and\na managed server.\n\n176\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.610\nThat can have the software,\nthat can keep track of all those.\n\n177\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.780\nThe other thing behind that, right,\n\n178\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:43.130\nis depending on the sophistication of your\nsyslog server, we can now filter it out.\n\n179\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.390\nWe can now filter it out by the router.\n\n180\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.080\nWe can filter it out by the time stamp.\n\n181\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.860\nWe can filter it out by\nthe type of messages.\n\n182\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.900\nSo it depends on the sophistication of the\nsyslog server that you're wanting to do.\n\n183\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.040\nSo, we can instead of\njust actually saying,\n\n184\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.550\njust send it over here into the buffer and\nthen we'll get whatever we can out of it.\n\n185\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.580\nWe can now store it.\n\n186\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.540\nAnd the nice thing is we can store\nit permanently if we need to\n\n187\n00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.660\non that Syslog server.\n\n188\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.135\n&gt;&gt; So your Syslog server can tell you what\nrouter the information came from as well.\n\n189\n00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:10.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nRight.\n\n190\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.590\nSo it can give us all that information\nas we start setting it up and\n\n191\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.720\nstart doing things.\n\n192\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.330\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n193\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.920\ndo that is what we're going to do.\n\n194\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.310\nAnd this is kind of recommended idea,\nanyways.\n\n195\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.050\nThe reason why we don't\nnecessarily want to just leave\n\n196\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.700\nsyslogs on the machine,\non the routers themselves, right?\n\n197\n00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.420\nIt's because they do fill up and\nthey'll end up, errors may pass by and\n\n198\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.430\ndifferent stuff.\n\n199\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.810\nStarting on syslog server,\n\n200\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.360\nif you have that ability to do so,\nthat is the way to go.\n\n201\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.280\nAnd that is the preferred method.\n\n202\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.410\nIt is scalable and it is fully functional.\n\n203\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.650\nAnd depending on how much\nmoney you're willing to spend,\n\n204\n00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.430\nit can give you a lot more features.\n\n205\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.780\nNow, we of course have not done that,\nwe've kind of gotten the,\n\n206\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.050\nI don't wanna say bottom of the barrel,\nthat's not exactly right.\n\n207\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.900\nBut we've gotten one that's actually\nbeen fairly functional but it doesn't\n\n208\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.980\nhave all the bells and whistles, right,\nthat we are gonna be sending it to.\n\n209\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.874\nSo on NY Edge 1 here, so we are actually\nbe using of course our practice labs here\n\n210\n00:11:08.874 --> 00:11:11.570\nand let me go and\nshow you the lab that we're doing,\n\n211\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.820\nwhich is gonna be configuring and\nverified device management.\n\n212\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.650\nAs you go through that particular link and\nyou see of\n\n213\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.280\ncourse the version 3.0 labs here,\nconfigure and verify device management.\n\n214\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.730\nThis is the labs that we are going\nto walk through just to show you.\n\n215\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.680\nThe configuration here of course\nis device monitoring which is\n\n216\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.040\ngonna be of course specifically\nthe idea of using syslogs too.\n\n217\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.600\nOkay.\n\n218\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.140\nSo once we point all of these\ndifferent devices that we had,\n\n219\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.970\nI'm only pointing this one cuz all of\nthe rest are pretty much the same.\n\n220\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.730\nIt now allows us to set it up.\n\n221\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.770\nSo, what we want to do then, is we're\nready to configure a couple of things.\n\n222\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.320\nSo I need turn on my Syslog server\nthat should just take just a moment\n\n223\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.860\nas I turn on the server that has\na software for this log server.\n\n224\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.270\nAnd we'll focus in on this router\nas we start to do this, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.710\nSo once this is up and running on\nthe router, then I want to get setup here.\n\n226\n00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.290\nMake sure I can get access in.\n\n227\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:11.510\nWe'll configure NY edge one first,\nso and then we'll wait for\n\n228\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.110\nthe syslog server to kind of boot up and\ndo what we need to do.\n\n229\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.670\nSo let's get into our global\nconfiguration mode here.\n\n230\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.360\nIt's like I can actually\nzoom just a tad bit more, so\n\n231\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.390\nthat we can see it a little bit better and\nwe'll get into our privilege mode and\n\n232\n00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.200\nthen into our global\nconfiguration mode as well.\n\n233\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.010\nAnd once we're in here,\n\n234\n00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.710\nthe neat thing is the command to\nactually do this Is insanely easy.\n\n235\n00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.390\nOkay.\n\n236\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.470\nSo we would think that we'd type\nin syslog or something like that.\n\n237\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.990\nYou don't even have to do that.\n\n238\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.660\nThe initial command at the very beginning\n\n239\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.140\nwas a command that was\njust called logging.\n\n240\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.400\nSo if I do a question mark after that,\nnotice\n\n241\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.670\nall the additional information and\noptions that we have available to us.\n\n242\n00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.930\nSo, I have logging and\nI can do all of these stuff here and\n\n243\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.180\nthere's the syslog server\nkind of popping up for us.\n\n244\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.660\nLet me see if I can move that off to\nanother window is what I want to do.\n\n245\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.590\nI'll move it over there.\n\n246\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.660\nAnd now, we'll be ready to go, okay?\n\n247\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:21.200\nSo as I continue to kind of take a look\nhere, okay, you can see that logging.\n\n248\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.690\nThere's a lot of useful information\nthat you can actually do.\n\n249\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.920\nAnd be able to set console parameters,\ndelimiters here, based on what you want.\n\n250\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.790\nHistory, if you want\nto actually show this.\n\n251\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.118\nIt lets you configure the history table.\n\n252\n00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:40.520\nYou can all even set a host syslog\nserver IP address and its parameters.\n\n253\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.570\nThat sounds exactly like what\nwe might need to do here.\n\n254\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.641\nAnd source-interface, you name it,\nyou can configure it however you want to.\n\n255\n00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:52.733\nBut for what we're doing in our lab,\nit's actually relatively simple in what\n\n256\n00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:58.847\nwe're going to do, which is we're gonna\npoint it to logging 192.168.16.10.\n\n257\n00:13:58.847 --> 00:14:04.097\nAnd that's gonna be the IP address of our,\noops,\n\n258\n00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:08.982\nif I can actually, logging twice.\n\n259\n00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:15.300\nLogging 192.168.16.10, let's try that.\n\n260\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.950\nI actually type it in correctly.\n\n261\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:21.620\nSo now NY edge 1 and you can see\nwhere it's beginning to do this,\n\n262\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.770\nit says logging host start stop,\nokay and so it's logging to this,\n\n263\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:32.570\nport 514 started command line initiated,\nso it's already generating some messages,\n\n264\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.730\nthe problem that I have is I haven't\nset up my sys log server yet, so\n\n265\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.270\nwe'll have to kind of do that again and\n\n266\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.110\nthen we'll hopefully be able\nto generate this Information.\n\n267\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.190\nSo, actually the easiest way,\nlet me do this for right now.\n\n268\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.510\nLet me do a no logging at this point.\n\n269\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.485\nAnd then we will set this back\nin here in a moment, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:50.890\nBut that's what we see.\n\n271\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:57.084\nSo we can now verify that it is wanting\nto send information to the IP address.\n\n272\n00:14:57.084 --> 00:15:00.630\nSo over here on PLLAB1 here.\n\n273\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.690\nLet me say, yes.\n\n274\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.260\nI guess we're gonna stay connected there.\n\n275\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.070\nI do have a syslog server on here.\n\n276\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.450\nAnd it's small and it's actually\nbeen around forever and a day, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.665\nThere is a small program that's free.\n\n278\n00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it does a lot, right?\n\n279\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.516\nIt's called TFTPD32.\n\n280\n00:15:21.516 --> 00:15:28.158\nIf I double-click on that for a moment,\nthat will bring me up to this and\n\n281\n00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:32.900\nthis guy, like I say, he's written this.\n\n282\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:38.050\nHe's even got a 64-bit version for\nthose that are running 64-bit as well,\n\n283\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:43.770\nso TFTP server and I already did type that\nin, so that means that one is ready to go.\n\n284\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.710\nYou do want to leave this running and\n\n285\n00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.980\njust make sure that you\nclick on Syslog Server tab.\n\n286\n00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.870\nHow's that?\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n287\n00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.008\n&gt;&gt; That would actually help\nout a little bit more.\n\n288\n00:15:53.008 --> 00:15:57.481\nSo once I do that and I verify\nthat I have the proper address For\n\n289\n00:15:57.481 --> 00:16:03.210\nthe server interface, which is my\ninterface and I want to set everything to.\n\n290\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.710\nThat is what we want,\nI just have to kind of leave it, and\n\n291\n00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.360\nthat's pretty much what I do here.\n\n292\n00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.070\nSo we're gonna leave that up and\nrunning so that we can verify, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.533\nNow, if I go back over to NYEDGE1, I\n\n294\n00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:23.722\ncan now do a logging 192.168.16.10.\n\n295\n00:16:27.572 --> 00:16:29.701\nMake sure I typed that incorrectly.\n\n296\n00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:32.373\n[COUGH] Every once in a while I'm\nnot exactly sure if I ask you to do\n\n297\n00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:33.540\nanything correctly here.\n\n298\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.495\nSo we'll do that, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.275\nSo as we start taking\na look at that idea of\n\n300\n00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:42.685\nsome messages that are coming across here,\nwe at least see one message,\n\n301\n00:16:42.685 --> 00:16:45.945\nright, the going across and\ndoing what we want to do here.\n\n302\n00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:52.990\nIf I scroll over, you can now see that\nit went ahead in this point here.\n\n303\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.290\nAnd it also gave us that message as well.\n\n304\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.540\nSo it is now starting to log it.\n\n305\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.460\nAnd that means even if\nthe router actually goes down or\n\n306\n00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.520\nsomething, we will now having\na historical record of this.\n\n307\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.510\nSo this is by far one of the most simple\nSyslog Server that there is out there.\n\n308\n00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.360\nThe newer and the more advancement,\nyou normally have to pay for\n\n309\n00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.990\nsometimes quite a bit of money, because\nof the filtering options that we have and\n\n310\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.750\nthat we talked about, okay?\n\n311\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.700\nSo, this is kind of just setting it up,\nand\n\n312\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.580\nyou notice that it's really not exactly\nthe hardest thing in the world.\n\n313\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.536\nBecause it's probably the simplest command\nthat we could actually ever run to make\n\n314\n00:17:29.536 --> 00:17:30.666\nsure that happens, but\n\n315\n00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:34.190\nthis is how you verify that\nsyslogging is working as well, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.640\nNow, the other thing that we can do, and\nthen we'll point out with some different\n\n317\n00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.450\nthings here while we're up and running,\nis I want to also change my buffer size.\n\n318\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.850\nSo if you happen to for one reason or\n\n319\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.360\nanother, look we need to\nchange the buffer size.\n\n320\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.480\nIt's perfectly fine if you're\nrunning a lot of debugging,\n\n321\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.100\nif you're running a lot of\ninformational messages here,\n\n322\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.750\ncuz you want to catch everything, then you\nmight want to increase the buffer size.\n\n323\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.190\nBut normally, we kind of leave this alone.\n\n324\n00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.930\nI just simply go ahead and\ntype in logging with just two G's,\n\n325\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.965\nnot the three, that would be insane.\n\n326\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.250\nAnd three Gs in a row I should say,\nlogging buffer.\n\n327\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.780\nNow, I would reset the sides, and\nyou just type in in bytes here.\n\n328\n00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.350\nAt least I think it is,\nlet's verify that just to make sure.\n\n329\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.730\nSo now you can see that there's\nactually logging buffer size, and\n\n330\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:30.810\nthis one will allow you from the minimum,\nokay, which should be in bytes, B-Y-T-E.\n\n331\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.231\nAll the way up to it looks like\n2 billion if we wanted to.\n\n332\n00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:38.320\nThat's 100,000, that's 100 million.\n\n333\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.660\nYeah, 2 billion, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.790\nSo I always have to count,\n\n335\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.970\ncuz I'm not as fast as everybody\nelse around here about counting.\n\n336\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.170\nSo I have to actually count those up for\nus, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.410\nSo when I take a look at\nthat logging buffer, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.630\nSo let's say, I wanna reset the size here.\n\n339\n00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.500\nLogging buffer, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:03.080\nOnce I get that up here,\nI can do let say 16384, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.160\nSo that's actually half of 32,768.\n\n342\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.840\nDon't ask me how I know that,\nbut I do know that, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.890\nSo is about 16 kilobytes instead.\n\n344\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.550\nSo I've quadrupled the size of the buffer.\n\n345\n00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.720\nBut remember that this again reduces\nwhatever it took from by its size,\n\n346\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.900\ntaking away that much too.\n\n347\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.460\nAll right, so Zac pretty much is about\nit in terms of the configuration that\n\n348\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.430\nwe have to do.\n\n349\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.530\nAnd this is not a very difficult, and\nmost of the time I wouldn't mess with\n\n350\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.210\nthe buffer size unless I was\ntold I need to change that.\n\n351\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.200\nBut we're not done yet,\n\n352\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.190\nbecause we need to talk about just\na couple of more things here.\n\n353\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.620\nLook at all this other stuff that\nyou see here such as alerts,\n\n354\n00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.170\ncritical here, and debugging.\n\n355\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:54.300\nNotice under here too, there's emergencies\nand errors, right, that you see.\n\n356\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:00.200\nAnd then, there's also informational,\nnotifications, and warnings, okay?\n\n357\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.150\nRight next, and even on this, yeah,\nwarnings, okay, which I didn't cover.\n\n358\n00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.720\nAnd over on the right-hand side,\nthey talked about severity, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.850\nThis is kind of the key also for\nus to understand too.\n\n360\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:19.080\nNotice that the severity of 0, okay, and\nits description here of what it says.\n\n361\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.470\nSystem is unusable, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.990\nKeep that in your mind.\n\n363\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.192\nIf we go ahead and take a look at\nthe severity level of seven, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:30.770\nNotice it says,\nthese are debugging messages.\n\n365\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.720\nSo the lower the severity level,\n\n366\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:40.840\nthe more critical it is to\nthe operation of this device, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.570\nSo what do I care?\n\n368\n00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.622\nWhy does that matter?\n\n369\n00:20:42.622 --> 00:20:45.320\nBecause the syslog messages that you and\n\n370\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.720\nI have been talking about, it normally\nincludes information just like this, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.550\nSo I've copied an example of\na syslog message right over here,\n\n372\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.760\nso that we can kind of break it\ndown just a little bit more.\n\n373\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.830\nSo over here on the very top,\n\n374\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.530\nI've broken down the way that\nnormally matches up here.\n\n375\n00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.600\nUsually when you see a syslog message,\nyou of course will see a timestamp, so\n\n376\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.830\nyou can see when I actually\ncreated this syslog message here.\n\n377\n00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.996\nYou can see a timestamp,\nwhich is always good.\n\n378\n00:21:16.996 --> 00:21:21.099\nRemember that we did an episode on\nthe idea of using NTP to sync up our\n\n379\n00:21:21.099 --> 00:21:21.918\ntimes here?\n\n380\n00:21:21.918 --> 00:21:22.576\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n381\n00:21:22.576 --> 00:21:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's why it's very important,\nbecause we don’t know if these messages\n\n382\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.915\nare wrong and inexact, it could have been\nyears ago for all that you and I know.\n\n383\n00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, time stamp's important.\n&gt;&gt; Or it could be brand new, so\n\n384\n00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.630\ntime stamp is very important.\n\n385\n00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:40.780\nThe facility, what that indicates is what\nhardware component are we talking about.\n\n386\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.720\nSo where did this occur?\n\n387\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.790\nWell, on this particular message,\nit occurred at the link.\n\n388\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.610\nIn other words,\nthat interface is where this occurred.\n\n389\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.190\nSo that percentage and that link,\nthat indicates the facility or\n\n390\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:57.340\nthe hardware component that\nit actually occurred on.\n\n391\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.850\nBut for you and me, this is what\nwe also want to pay attention to,\n\n392\n00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.230\nwhich is the one that I circled here.\n\n393\n00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:09.040\nAnd then, notice these severity levels,\njust like what we were pointing out, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.663\nSo these, do you need to know them?\n\n395\n00:22:12.663 --> 00:22:13.731\nYes, okay?\n\n396\n00:22:13.731 --> 00:22:17.100\nUnfortunately yes,\nyou do need to pay attention to them.\n\n397\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.980\nBut I don't wanna worry\nabout too much detail.\n\n398\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.890\nBut remember this, right?\n\n399\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.350\nThe severity level of these things.\n\n400\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.620\nThe lower the number,\nthe more severe it actually is.\n\n401\n00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.220\nSo it goes from here, Emergency,\nAlert, Critical, Error, Warning,\n\n402\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.620\nNotification, Information,\nand Debugging, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.331\nSo make sure you understand that.\n\n404\n00:22:39.331 --> 00:22:41.375\nNow for you and me though, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:41.375 --> 00:22:44.310\nAs we start to do that we will kind\nof talk about something else here.\n\n406\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.120\nBut just kind of remember that this is\nthe order that you want to remember.\n\n407\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.500\nSo from the top to the bottom,\nthe top one is gonna be the most severe.\n\n408\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You also have a pneumonic.\n\n409\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.170\nNow this idea of a pneumonic for\n\n410\n00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.190\nwhat we want to do is this is how\nwe describe what has happened.\n\n411\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.150\nSo an UPDOWN here tells me that\nsomething happened on that interface.\n\n412\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.970\nWhat I did,\nis I Issue to shutdown a no shutdown.\n\n413\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.310\nAnd when I did that,\nit actually had an UPDOWN signal.\n\n414\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.260\nAnd then the description here tells\nyou that something else happened.\n\n415\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.780\nNotice it says changed the state to down.\n\n416\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.050\nSo this is probably when I issued a\nshutdown, so I could grab this command and\n\n417\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.390\ndo this.\n\n418\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.380\nSo that's the way that we normally\ndescribe it as an UPDOWN, okay?\n\n419\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.650\nSo if you want to refer to it anyway,\nespecially\n\n420\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.530\nwhen somebody is asking you if you call in\nsupport and you go, hey, I have an UPDOWN.\n\n421\n00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.150\nWell, the timestamp is not gonna\nbe important to somebody on\n\n422\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.460\ntechnical support.\n\n423\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.240\nBut the idea of the UPDOWN is,\nand the idea of, hey,\n\n424\n00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.990\nI'm getting a severity level of 0,\nwell that might be a 2.\n\n425\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.582\nWhatever it might be, that's something\nthat you want to understand, okay?\n\n426\n00:23:45.582 --> 00:23:50.346\nBut usually it helps us to at least\nmanually debug now as we start seeing\n\n427\n00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.385\ninformation coming across.\n\n428\n00:23:52.385 --> 00:23:53.463\nAll right.\n\n429\n00:23:53.463 --> 00:23:54.820\nDo I need to memorize this?\n\n430\n00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.527\nYes, but in the severity, okay.\n\n431\n00:23:57.527 --> 00:23:59.966\nSo is there an easy way and\nthe funny thing is,\n\n432\n00:23:59.966 --> 00:24:02.460\nI'm into this idea of a mnemonic, right?\n\n433\n00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.323\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So here's what I learned from a world\n\n434\n00:24:05.323 --> 00:24:11.170\nfamous Cisco teacher, Todd Lammle and\nI was, okay, this is cool.\n\n435\n00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.590\nSo here this is the easiest way I know\nto memorize it cuz he was the one that\n\n436\n00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.468\ntold me about it, okay.\n\n437\n00:24:16.468 --> 00:24:20.480\nHe said there is the easiest way for\nyou to memorize syslogs and severity logs.\n\n438\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.120\nEvery Awesome Cisco Engineer Will\nNeed Information Daily, okay?.\n\n439\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.793\nSo notice E,\n\n440\n00:24:27.793 --> 00:24:36.950\nEvery Awesome Cisco Engineer Will\nNeed Information Daily, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.870\nSo if you can remember that pneumonic,\nhopefully that will give a leg up,\n\n442\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.690\nin remembering the severity levels here.\n\n443\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.340\nAnd just associate,\nI will write in severity level, and\n\n444\n00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.620\nwrite in not only these.\n\n445\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.710\nBut write these and copy it down,\n\n446\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.130\nmake sure you understand what\nyou are seeing it, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.405\nSo there's a lot of good information\nwhen you start to take a look at\n\n448\n00:24:56.405 --> 00:24:59.340\nwhat's actually happening\nas you start doing this.\n\n449\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Very well done sir.\n\n450\n00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.800\n&gt;&gt; So, this is important because I am,\nagain, I can't\n\n451\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.850\nguarantee you that you'll absolutely\nsee something like that on the exam.\n\n452\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:15.320\nBut I wouldn't put it past Cisco to say\nwe need to know if our professionals\n\n453\n00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.650\nare really able to take a look at\nthe data that they're given and\n\n454\n00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.460\ndetermine something like,\nis this device still functional or not?\n\n455\n00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.690\nWell, I know at least at this point,\nright, if it is probably a one or\n\n456\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:35.640\na zero, maybe a one is still okay,\nbut zero means it's not functioning.\n\n457\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.610\nNotice that even a one it says\nimmediate action is needed,\n\n458\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.020\nand that means something\nis about to go wrong.\n\n459\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.740\nCritical is saying, I am seeing all\nthe indications of imminent failure.\n\n460\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.500\nIf you don't do something about it,\nit's gonna become unusable, okay?\n\n461\n00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.030\nSo, just realize that you'll see that, but\n\n462\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.600\nmost of the time, when we\nare normally seeing, of course then,\n\n463\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.980\nespecially in the messages like what we\nare doing, notice this UPDOWN, right?\n\n464\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.200\nI shut down that port.\n\n465\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:05.430\nIt's only a severity level which is\na notification here of five means normal.\n\n466\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.320\nThat's significant, that's what we are\nnormally looking for is between five and\n\n467\n00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.030\nsix, right?\n\n468\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:16.710\nWhere it says normal, normal those\nare good five and six are good too.\n\n469\n00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.340\nSeven is always good as well,\n\n470\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.270\nbut it also may indicate you need to\nturn off debugging if you are done.\n\n471\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.680\nBecause debugging messages can overwhelm\na router if you're not careful.\n\n472\n00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.120\nBut once you get beyond that four warning,\n\n473\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:36.000\nhopefully the actual description here,\nthe adjective that they're using warning,\n\n474\n00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.400\nerror, critical,\nimmediate action is needed.\n\n475\n00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.030\nOkay, hopefully that tells\nyou something like yeah,\n\n476\n00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.012\nsomething else needs to\nbe done at this point.\n\n477\n00:26:44.012 --> 00:26:45.469\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you gotta take care of it.\n\n478\n00:26:45.469 --> 00:26:48.440\nYeah, at least that's what\nyou hope ends up, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.300\nSo the Cisco console, it doesn't tend\nto show us in red letters, okay?\n\n480\n00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.440\nAnd it doesn't have an alert,\nlike a beeping that continues to go off.\n\n481\n00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.180\nIt may go up in flames before it actually\ndoes any other beeping that too.\n\n482\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.960\nBut just realize that that's\nwhy we keep trackers.\n\n483\n00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.460\nSo, the more messages that we get, instead\nof sitting right here on the router and\n\n484\n00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:13.440\ntrying to console into it, we would be\nmonitoring our own syslog server, instead.\n\n485\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.830\nAnd this is where we would do that.\n\n486\n00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:19.000\nSo, of all the other routers and switches,\nthey will actually come in here, and\n\n487\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640\nthen if we had that\nability with this tool.\n\n488\n00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.820\nWe could even see multiple logging\nmessages indicating from whom,\n\n489\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.940\nwhich will actually be like\n16.2.3.4 whatever might be.\n\n490\n00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.448\nAnd we could even see the time and\ndate stamps.\n\n491\n00:27:33.448 --> 00:27:36.690\nAnd those are matching up and\ncorrect, are not you-name-it.\n\n492\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.950\nAnd then of course take a look at the\nlogging messages themselves, whether or\n\n493\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.190\nnot they are working\nthe way that they need to.\n\n494\n00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.155\nSo that or at least what we wanna\ndemonstrate in terms of just monitoring,\n\n495\n00:27:46.155 --> 00:27:51.110\nremember that the command is really\nsimple, logging, and then the IP address\n\n496\n00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:57.210\nor even the word host and the IP address\nof where we're sending information to.\n\n497\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.950\nAnd then on the other end we just need to\nverify that we have a syslog server which\n\n498\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:08.100\nis indicated at least by this tab, not so\nmuch the TFTP 32 which is part of it,\n\n499\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.240\nbut is a basic syslog server here and\nthese can be very sophisticated too, okay?\n\n500\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.230\nSo Zack,\nthat's actually a demonstrating for\n\n501\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.080\nus in terms of the monitoring\nthat we're doing.\n\n502\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.810\nBut there's still a few other types of\ninfrastructure maintenance things that we\n\n503\n00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.440\nhave to but that'll be for\ndifferent episodes.\n\n504\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.300\n&gt;&gt; Well done, sir.\n\n505\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.750\nImplement device monitoring,\ngreat episode as usual, Ronnie.\n\n506\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.640\nAnd before we move on to anything else.\n\n507\n00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.590\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again we're starting to see\nwhere we're winding down a few things.\n\n508\n00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.250\nThe commands are no longer as\ntechnically challenging anymore.\n\n509\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.690\nBut they are essential and\n\n510\n00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.010\nthey are actually gonna be things that\nyou're gonna need to be able to do.\n\n511\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.540\nBecause now we're talking about\ntrying to maintain these devices,\n\n512\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.600\nthe only way you and I can do that is\nby having good, solid information, and\n\n513\n00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.785\nmaking sure that we're getting all that\nstuff set up the way that we want to.\n\n514\n00:28:53.785 --> 00:28:58.700\nSo, look over this,\nthis shouldn't be at this\n\n515\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.460\npoint a topic that scares you,\nyou should see where, my gosh,\n\n516\n00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.380\nit really is just that simple,\none keyboard and an IP address?\n\n517\n00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.050\nYes and then the other side,\njust turn on the TFTP server and\n\n518\n00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.470\nyes, that's pretty much about it.\n\n519\n00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.830\nAnd it will start working as long as\nthey're on the same network, you're fine.\n\n520\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.811\n&gt;&gt; And you will be working fine as long\nas you watch every single episode of\n\n521\n00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:22.628\nCisco CCENT.\n\n522\n00:29:22.628 --> 00:29:24.764\nGreat series Ronnie has put together for\nyou.\n\n523\n00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:28.218\nAnd you'll be in the course library where\nthere's thousands of other videos and\n\n524\n00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:29.760\nright there to help you go further.\n\n525\n00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.848\nSo check those out too.\n\n526\n00:29:30.848 --> 00:29:32.857\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n527\n00:29:32.857 --> 00:29:34.679\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n528\n00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:36.259\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n529\n00:29:36.259 --> 00:29:37.047\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n530\n00:29:37.047 --> 00:29:38.499\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n531\n00:29:38.499 --> 00:29:45.640\n[MUSIC]\n\n532\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.473\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.608\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:10.690\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.860\nchoosing ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.863\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Cisco's CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:22.870\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna configure device management.\n\n8\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.931\nThat's what we're going to do, I mean it!\n\n9\n00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.799\nAnd Ronnie Wong is going\nto show you how to do it.\n\n10\n00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:28.805\nHe's gonna show you.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Zach, for\n\n11\n00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.446\nhelping us out as we continue\non in our journey together.\n\n12\n00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.882\nAnd in getting ready for that CCENT exam,\n\n13\n00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:38.430\nwe are in our final topic once again\nof infrastructure maintenance now.\n\n14\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.754\nSo we're now talking about\nsome of the concepts.\n\n15\n00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:42.690\nAnd some of them we've\nalready reviewed before.\n\n16\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.256\nAnd this is just a final type of very\nshort review that we're doing to\n\n17\n00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:47.580\ngo over these concepts.\n\n18\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.578\nNow that you've already heard it one time,\n\n19\n00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:53.370\nwe're now just making sure that we\nunderstand the basic configuration.\n\n20\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.297\nNow, Zach,\nduring this entire series, okay?\n\n21\n00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:57.850\nYeah, you were with me for\na good part of it.\n\n22\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.810\nBut also another host was with me as well.\n\n23\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.326\nDaniel was with me, too.\n\n24\n00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:05.590\nSo you didn't get to see some of it and\nyou got to see some of it as well.\n\n25\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.525\nBut there's been one thing that I've\nbeen consistent at throughout the entire\n\n26\n00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:09.060\nseries here.\n\n27\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710\nWhich is that I have not saved any\nconfiguration that I've done, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.903\nNow, the very fact is,\n\n29\n00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:18.808\nI mentioned this at one of the other\nepisodes when Daniel was hosting with me.\n\n30\n00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:22.220\nI was like you should save and\nsave often, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.619\nThe reason why is if you lose power,\nright, during a configuration,\n\n32\n00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.644\nall those changes that you made are gone.\n\n33\n00:01:27.644 --> 00:01:31.523\nSo if you're in the middle of\na configuration, excuse me,\n\n34\n00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:34.790\nthat is really technically challenging for\nyou.\n\n35\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.230\nAnd you don't save as you're going along,\nit can bite you, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.283\nNow, it doesn't always bite you,\nbut it can bite you and\n\n37\n00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:44.640\nit can cause some heartache.\n\n38\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.225\nEspecially if there's a lot\nof configuration that happens\n\n39\n00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:47.480\n&gt;&gt; You need to backup your backups.\n\n40\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.037\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\n\n41\n00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:50.550\nthat's what we're talking about today,\n\n42\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.776\nis the idea of backing up\nthe information that we have.\n\n43\n00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:58.675\nSo we're going of course demonstrate\nthis idea of making sure that you and\n\n44\n00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:03.460\nI know how to backup our, well,\nrouter or switch configurations.\n\n45\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.950\nThe great thing is, regardless of\nwhich one that we're on, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.660\nThe backup to these configurations are,\nwell, identical, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.782\nSo using the same tools, regardless of\nwhether we're on the router or switch,\n\n48\n00:02:14.782 --> 00:02:15.466\nwe can do so.\n\n49\n00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.232\nAnd we can make sure that we\nrun these different backups and\n\n50\n00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:20.670\nmake sure that they all work\nthe way that we want to.\n\n51\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.865\nAnd so that's another part of it,\nand of course,\n\n52\n00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:28.380\nis the other aspect of it which\nis a restoration as well, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.885\nSo that's what we wanna set up so\nyou can take a look at this.\n\n54\n00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.872\nAll right, so\nlet's get back to our router here and\n\n55\n00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:37.665\nthis will help us out as we begin, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:41.125\nSo in this series I have been\nreally bad at doing this.\n\n57\n00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.137\nAnd the reason why as I knew that\nI wasn't gonna save these changes.\n\n58\n00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:46.230\nAnd it's more important for\nyou to go through and\n\n59\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.845\nunderstand the changes as I was\ndescribing them and I didn't save them.\n\n60\n00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:51.572\nBut you should, okay?\n\n61\n00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:55.462\nNow, let's go ahead and\nremind ourselves here.\n\n62\n00:02:55.462 --> 00:02:58.614\nLet me get into the privileged\nexec mode and what's on there.\n\n63\n00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:01.909\nSee if I can zoom in\njust a little bit more.\n\n64\n00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.732\nSo once I'm in here, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:07.589\nAnd let's remember what we have to\ndo to just save our configuration.\n\n66\n00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:12.720\nRemember that when we are taking a look at\nwhat's happening right now on our screen.\n\n67\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.217\nThis is the configuration that we use\nthat's called the running config.\n\n68\n00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:20.540\nSo if I type in show,\n\n69\n00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:27.422\nrunning-config like this.\n\n70\n00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:29.789\nRemember that the entire\ncurrent configuration, and\n\n71\n00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:33.080\nthat's what you want to make sure\nthat you understand here, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.103\nIt's called the running-config.\n\n73\n00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:37.903\nHere is what you'll end up seeing,\nat least at the beginning,\n\n74\n00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:38.463\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n75\n00:03:38.463 --> 00:03:39.886\n&gt;&gt; Cuz notice it says,\n\n76\n00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.990\nCurrent configuration : 1426 bytes.\n\n77\n00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.920\nAnd then it goes through of\ncourse the platform itself,\n\n78\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.089\nwhich I can't control, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:54.098\nIt goes through, let me hit the spacebar\nhere, and list any configuration,\n\n80\n00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:55.401\nif I've got any on here.\n\n81\n00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:59.190\nThat's where you'll actually\nhave these configurations, okay?\n\n82\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.693\nSo there's a few, there's not a lot\nbecause we haven't really done much with\n\n83\n00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:04.350\nthis, but that's the way it stays.\n\n84\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.460\nNow there is something that is different,\nokay, which can be different.\n\n85\n00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.749\nBut let me go and make a change so\n\n86\n00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.038\nthat I know that we've made\na difference here, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:14.799\nSo let's say that what I do,\nat this point,\n\n88\n00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.745\nis that I add in something additional,\nokay?\n\n89\n00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.355\nSo let's do it this way.\n\n90\n00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:23.976\nWe'll do an enable secret here,\nand we'll just do cisco12.\n\n91\n00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:29.871\nActually we'll just do cisco cuz\nthey warn us on the practice labs.\n\n92\n00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:33.169\nI wanna follow their best\npractices in this term.\n\n93\n00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.910\nNow if you put a password on it,\nmake sure it's at least a cisco.\n\n94\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.280\nDon't try and do anything fancy.\n\n95\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.650\nSo we'll just do something like this,\nokay?\n\n96\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.692\nWhich is enable cisco secret, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:49.661\nNow, when I do something like that and\n\n98\n00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:54.650\nI type in here show running-config.\n\n99\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.820\nWell now if I scroll\nback at the beginning.\n\n100\n00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.320\nIf you remember the first time that we\ndid this, it was 1426 bytes, right?\n\n101\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.026\nAs I scroll all the way back up here\nto the top, let me see if I can,\n\n102\n00:05:07.026 --> 00:05:08.420\nyep, 1426 bytes.\n\n103\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:15.490\nAnd now currently, what the running\nconfig is showing as is 1473, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.540\nWhen the router reboots though, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.980\nThis is not where it goes automatically,\nokay?\n\n106\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.610\nIt can, but it doesn't necessarily\nhave to come here automatically, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.830\nIt actually looks for a file that we call\nstartup-config is what it looks for.\n\n108\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.016\nSo when we go through the router reboot,\nand\n\n109\n00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:40.040\nthat means the post power on, self test.\n\n110\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.190\nFrom that point it looks for\nthe bootstrap program.\n\n111\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.024\nThat says hey, here's where you\nfind the operating system and\n\n112\n00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:49.060\nit points to the flash normally.\n\n113\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.060\nAnd then the operating system gets\nloaded into RAM at that point.\n\n114\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.259\nWhen the operating system gets\nsuccessfully loaded in RAM,\n\n115\n00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.950\nit now goes and looks in something\ncalled NVRAM, non-volatile RAM.\n\n116\n00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.351\nWhich pulls in the startup-config and\n\n117\n00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:08.610\nplaces that on top of\nthe operating system.\n\n118\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.967\nAnd that is what we normally see when\nwe start up the router or the switch.\n\n119\n00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:17.580\nAnd we're given the promptness as\npress Enter to continue, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.986\nSo if you have everything saved and\nconfigured there,\n\n121\n00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:24.255\nwell then you should also\nhave all of these changes.\n\n122\n00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:27.010\nBut let me show you\nsomething else as well.\n\n123\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.705\nSo let me do this.\n\n124\n00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:32.529\nLet me type in show startup-config.\n\n125\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.028\nNow notice this,\nthis actually shows me something here.\n\n126\n00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:42.050\nIf I have never saved anything before,\nokay?\n\n127\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.660\nIt lets me know something as well.\n\n128\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.945\nRonnie, you have not saved\nanything before, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:50.573\nSo startup-config is not present.\n\n130\n00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:55.240\nSo when we do that right then I know that\nthis machine is just going to be blank.\n\n131\n00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.396\nIf I reboot this machine, it's not gonna\nhave the IP addresses on the interfaces.\n\n132\n00:06:59.396 --> 00:07:03.974\nIt's not gonna show the enable secret\nthat I did unless I go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:03.974 --> 00:07:06.410\nI save that configuration.\n\n134\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.880\nSo now if I type in here copy\n\n135\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.862\nrunning-config startup,\n\n136\n00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:22.796\n[LAUGH] Why can't I spell startup?\n\n137\n00:07:22.796 --> 00:07:25.208\nstartup-config.\n\n138\n00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:32.050\nAnd press Enter, it now actually says hey,\nare you sure this is what you want?\n\n139\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.910\nThe word there, startup-config,\nis technically the one that you want.\n\n140\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.217\nDo not change this, because if\nyou change it to startup1-config,\n\n141\n00:07:40.217 --> 00:07:42.160\nit's not gonna recognize it.\n\n142\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.810\nIt says here is the name of\nthe file that I'm looking for.\n\n143\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.000\nSo that if I boot up, here's the current\nconfiguration that we'll have.\n\n144\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.751\nSo now I'm building the configuration,\nand that's fine.\n\n145\n00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:52.870\nThat means it's saving it.\n\n146\n00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.499\nAnd now you'll get, of course,\na response that says OK.\n\n147\n00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:00.284\nSo at this point,\nlet's change something again here.\n\n148\n00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:05.736\nLet's do We'll get into global config.\n\n149\n00:08:08.337 --> 00:08:14.416\nAnd now let's go ahead and\n\n150\n00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:18.841\ndo a line vty 0 4.\n\n151\n00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:22.108\nOnce we do something like that,\nI can now do like, login.\n\n152\n00:08:25.953 --> 00:08:29.190\nAnd then password, and we do cisco again.\n\n153\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.050\nSo I'm now added in just\na little bit more here.\n\n154\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:37.251\nSo this changes the running config do\n\n155\n00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:42.339\nshow, running-config.\n\n156\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.450\nAnd you can see where we have now\ncontinued to build a little bit more.\n\n157\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.061\nIt is now 1489 bytes here, but\n\n158\n00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:57.833\nif I now show the startup-config,\n\n159\n00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.230\nYou'll now see where.\n\n160\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.708\nLet me see if I can find it,\nstartup-config here.\n\n161\n00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:14.520\nLet me do it so\nthat you can actually see it.\n\n162\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.260\nI keep saying that.\n\n163\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.540\nLet me do it so\nthat you can actually read it.\n\n164\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.316\nLet's put it that way, cuz that's\na little bit harder to read for you.\n\n165\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.525\nThat's what I was hoping to do,\nat least I think it is.\n\n166\n00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:34.390\nOkay, notice the difference when\nwe ask for the startup-config.\n\n167\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.600\nSo I want you to see the comparison here,\nand the recognition, of these two lines.\n\n168\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.870\nSays using 1473, well, that's different\nfrom the 1489 that we just showed.\n\n169\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.660\nBut out of the this amount of RAM here,\nwhich is about 26 gigs,\n\n170\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.980\nor not gigs, megabytes of RAM,\nthat's fine.\n\n171\n00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.570\nBut if I scroll all the way back up,\n\n172\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.480\nremember when I did\nthe show running-config?\n\n173\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.813\nWhen I did the show running-config,\nlet me go,\n\n174\n00:10:00.813 --> 00:10:04.242\nlooks like I got to go\na little bit further up here.\n\n175\n00:10:04.242 --> 00:10:12.480\nWhen I did the show running-config,\nNotice the way that it's reported.\n\n176\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.199\nThis one just says\nthe current configuration.\n\n177\n00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:20.680\nSo I want us to focus\nin on that difference.\n\n178\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.316\nCurrent configuration for\nyou and me even if I don't see,\n\n179\n00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:30.800\nAnything like that at the very\ntop edge of the screen.\n\n180\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.960\nAnd I'm looking and\nI need to distinguish whether or\n\n181\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.670\nnot this is the startup-config or\nthe running-config.\n\n182\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.650\nI need to be able to look at this and\ngo, this is what the running-config,\n\n183\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.870\nthe current configuration is\nequal to the running-config\n\n184\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:55.070\ncompared to what we saw here at\nthe bottom which is the difference.\n\n185\n00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.433\nOne shows you that this is\nwhat is now written in NVRAM.\n\n186\n00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:04.680\nThere's a limited amount of NVRAM,\nand it is actually using this much.\n\n187\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.830\nNot a limited amount,\nthere's a limited amount of RAM, and\n\n188\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.130\nit's saying that right now it\nis also using that much of it.\n\n189\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.500\nSo not NVRAM.\n\n190\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.690\nI'm starting to do some other\nthings that I shouldn't.\n\n191\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.530\nSo that's what you're also seeing there.\n\n192\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.540\nSo that's important, and\nas long as that particular file is there,\n\n193\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.620\nwe're good because we'll boot up and it\nwill have all of our configuration on it.\n\n194\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.620\nBut there are times, though,\nwhere something can go wrong.\n\n195\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.830\nWhatever it might be, it can go wrong.\n\n196\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.482\nYou reboot the router and\nit's just not working.\n\n197\n00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:39.950\nThe startup-config has\ncorrupted whatever it might be.\n\n198\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.570\nIt is possible.\n\n199\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.120\nSo the best thing to do, of course,\n\n200\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.840\nis to actually be able to back this up\nin a couple of different locations.\n\n201\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:57.470\nSo depending on who does this, some older\nCisco engineers will tell you, say look,\n\n202\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.730\njust back it up to the flash,\nthe CompactFlash card.\n\n203\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.350\nThat itself is essentially the hard drive,\nand you can do that.\n\n204\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.960\nOkay, you can actually take the\nrunning-config or the startup-config and\n\n205\n00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.092\nmake a back up copy on\nthe flash drive itself.\n\n206\n00:12:13.092 --> 00:12:17.102\nAnd that makes copy of it in flash, and\n\n207\n00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:19.210\nthat is not going to corrupt,\nusually it doesn't.\n\n208\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.490\nOr the better way to do it instead is\nto move it off the device completely,\n\n209\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.990\nwhich is using another server to do so.\n\n210\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.165\nSo we can actually backup the config\nright here at the startup-config, or\n\n211\n00:12:33.165 --> 00:12:35.580\nthe running-config if we choose to,\n\n212\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.450\nto another device which would be safer\nin case the device catches on fire.\n\n213\n00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.980\nIf it catches on fire, and\nI backed up only to the flash,\n\n214\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.540\nwell the flash card's gonna melt cuz\nit's actually got a plastic casing-\n\n215\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.630\n&gt;&gt; That's right there, yeah.\n\n216\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.957\n&gt;&gt; And then you're kinda toast.\n\n217\n00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:53.322\nBut if I backed it up\nto a server somewhere,\n\n218\n00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:57.010\nit can keep a track of\nthat somewhere else.\n\n219\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.220\nAnd then when I reboot and\nI want it to actually do what I need to,\n\n220\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.520\nI can connect back to that server and\nthen tell it to pull it back.\n\n221\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.970\nThe simplest one, and the one that\nwe've used most historically, and\n\n222\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:13.530\nthe one that they're gonna get you on\non the exam, is using a Tftp server,\n\n223\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.120\nwhich, really by default,\nhandles UDP traffic for us.\n\n224\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.460\nThat means it doesn't do any checks or\nanything.\n\n225\n00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.850\nIt is just designed for\n\n226\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.520\nyou to transfer files from one\nplace over to another place, here.\n\n227\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.520\nSo let's verify at this point here\nthat our server is up and running.\n\n228\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:39.092\nTftp32D, right, Tftpd, excuse me, 32,\nit is also gonna be our tool of choice.\n\n229\n00:13:39.092 --> 00:13:44.170\nInstead of the sys log server,\nwe're gonna be running the Tftp server.\n\n230\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.370\nThe great thing is, once we configure it,\nit's already on, which is great cuz\n\n231\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.930\nit means that all this stuff,\nif we want to use it, is up and available.\n\n232\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.440\nRight now we're gonna\nuse this Tftp server.\n\n233\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.166\nIt's gonna become the storage\nrepository for my startup-config and\n\n234\n00:13:58.166 --> 00:14:00.070\nmy running-config if I choose to.\n\n235\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.400\nAll right, so once I get that down and\n\n236\n00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.640\nready to go, I am now ready to\nmake a transfer by using Tftp.\n\n237\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.430\nSo the way that we do this,\nonce we get it up and\n\n238\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.330\nrunning here, and we've copied now\nsomething into startup-config.\n\n239\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.800\nWe are now ready to go.\n\n240\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.145\nAll I have to do is actually\ntype in copy at this point,\n\n241\n00:14:24.157 --> 00:14:31.453\nrunning-config tftp.\n\n242\n00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.805\nSo that is essential.\n\n243\n00:14:33.805 --> 00:14:34.840\nSo what am I saying?\n\n244\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.810\nI'm saying copy the entire\nrunning-config here to the tftp.\n\n245\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:46.200\nNow I can type in a lot more here,\nspecify what the server IP address is.\n\n246\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.540\nBut if I can't remember the syntax,\nI'm gonna leave it exactly like this.\n\n247\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.810\nAnd then when I press Enter it's gonna\nsay, hey, what is the IP address?\n\n248\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.759\nThat's gonna be 192.168.16.10.\n\n249\n00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:02.730\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for\nthe destination file name.\n\n250\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.530\nNow notice that the file\nname has changed here.\n\n251\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.050\nIs nyedge1-confg, so\n\n252\n00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:16.270\nit's actually dropped the i\nbetween the f and the g there.\n\n253\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.310\nSo we'll leave it as that,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n254\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.760\nAnd it didn't take long.\n\n255\n00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.480\nNotice it actually has\ntwo exclamation points.\n\n256\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.720\nAnd if we remember,\nthat's exactly what we told it.\n\n257\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.823\nIs running-config was 1489 bytes.\n\n258\n00:15:28.823 --> 00:15:30.370\nIt copied it over.\n\n259\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.930\nLet's verify that that is true.\n\n260\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.470\nAnd in a moment here, or at least.\n\n261\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.220\nWait, I forgot.\n\n262\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.350\nDid I?\nLet me browse.\n\n263\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:44.763\nI was gonna say, maybe I didn't because,\nno that is the right directory.\n\n264\n00:15:44.763 --> 00:15:46.382\nLet me see if I can see\nother directory here.\n\n265\n00:15:46.382 --> 00:15:47.600\nThere it is, okay.\n\n266\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.170\nSo there's the one I just copied.\n\n267\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:54.550\nI was like, where did it go, so here it\nis, nyedge1, and this is the date here.\n\n268\n00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:59.954\nAgain, it's the French date, the 22,\nthe month, and then the year here.\n\n269\n00:15:59.954 --> 00:16:02.771\nSo this is what we see\nis that it copied it.\n\n270\n00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:04.832\nThere's a 1489.\n\n271\n00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:05.773\nAnd we are ready to go.\n\n272\n00:16:05.773 --> 00:16:07.088\nI was looking for it right here.\n\n273\n00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:11.058\nI was like, it copied it but\nit actually did it when it was copying and\n\n274\n00:16:11.058 --> 00:16:12.120\nit stored there.\n\n275\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.150\nNow, can I do the same thing\nwith the startup config?\n\n276\n00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.750\nWell, of course, okay.\n\n277\n00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:22.250\nSo if I do the same thing,\ncopy startup-config tftp.\n\n278\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.142\nNow it's gonna ask me the same thing,\n192.168.16.10.\n\n279\n00:16:29.142 --> 00:16:31.482\nAnd it's gonna say, hey,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n280\n00:16:31.482 --> 00:16:36.981\nThis time I'm gonna change it up here and\n\n281\n00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:41.834\nthen type in nyedge01 here just as\n\n282\n00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:46.687\nan example to do, nyedgestartup,\n\n283\n00:16:46.687 --> 00:16:51.090\nlet's just do that, -confg.\n\n284\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.229\nNow, notice it copied it, 1473 bytes.\n\n285\n00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:56.869\nQuickly, it would have actually\nregistered a log here, but\n\n286\n00:16:56.869 --> 00:16:58.770\nthen I select show directory.\n\n287\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.000\nAnd now you can see where it did\ncopy it right through there, okay.\n\n288\n00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.310\nSo we can actually back all that up,\nand that is a good thing for us.\n\n289\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:12.100\nNow what if we then go ahead and\nwe reboot the EDGE router?\n\n290\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.480\nWe're not gonna do this right now,\n\n291\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.575\nokay, because it could take a long\ntime before it comes back up.\n\n292\n00:17:16.575 --> 00:17:20.365\nBut what if we actually wanted instead,\nwhen we go, look,\n\n293\n00:17:20.365 --> 00:17:25.990\nthat's not the proper configuration\nthat is on this device right now, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.930\nWell we can do it this way too.\n\n295\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.750\nSo I'm going to do something a little\nbit different to help us out here.\n\n296\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:39.871\nI can copy the the startup-config\nto the running-config.\n\n297\n00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:45.930\nWait, I did the wrong name.\n\n298\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:46.806\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n299\n00:17:46.806 --> 00:17:50.005\n[LAUGH] I was gonna say,\nwhen did that actually accept that?\n\n300\n00:17:50.005 --> 00:17:55.300\nCopy startup-config to running-config,\n\n301\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.488\nthat should be a little bit better.\n\n302\n00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:06.095\nNow it's gonna go ahead and do that,\n\n303\n00:18:06.095 --> 00:18:13.340\ndo show running-config,\nshow running-config.\n\n304\n00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.980\nI always use the word do,\nI'm usually in some other mode here.\n\n305\n00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.500\nSo it merged it together\nwhen I chose to do that.\n\n306\n00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.910\nSo it will do something like that as well.\n\n307\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.200\nIt will merge those together.\n\n308\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.155\nIf there's any differences\nit will add that in.\n\n309\n00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:28.690\nBut if I were to do something\nlike that and I said, hey,\n\n310\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:33.090\nI didn't know what happened, and I saw\nchanges in here that I didn't recognize,\n\n311\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.350\nso there were no real changes that I did.\n\n312\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.468\nBut if I did something like that, and\nI'm like, my gosh, I screwed up, okay.\n\n313\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.570\nThat's when you'd have to go back in,\nand now you could go ahead and\n\n314\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:44.905\ndo one of two things, right.\n\n315\n00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:48.960\nYou could delete the entire\nstartup-config, which you can do, and\n\n316\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.270\nthen you can copy back up.\n\n317\n00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.760\nBut we're not gonna delete it for\nright now,\n\n318\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.580\ncuz we don't want to\nmess anything up here.\n\n319\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.533\nBut what I can do is I can say,\n\n320\n00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:05.970\ncopy tftp to running-config, instead.\n\n321\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.148\nWhen I do so, getting the same thing but\n\n322\n00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:11.080\nthis time we're doing it\nin the other direction.\n\n323\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.281\nAnd now it's asking me for the source\nname, and that one's nyedge1-confg,\n\n324\n00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:16.670\nif I remember correctly.\n\n325\n00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:23.800\nAnd that's saying, hey, are you sure\nyou want to make this the destination?\n\n326\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.300\nThere it goes, and there it is.\n\n327\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.670\nIt went ahead and loaded it right in.\n\n328\n00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:32.610\nYou can also see where it was\nable to take advantage of that.\n\n329\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.490\nAnd now, as long as we've got it connected\nin, the hard part, and remember this,\n\n330\n00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:37.490\nis you reboot your router and\n\n331\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.830\nit's not showing up, you don't have\nenough to connect over the network.\n\n332\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.930\nSo you'll probably have to at\nleast configure one interface\n\n333\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.030\nto get this done the way that you want to,\nokay,\n\n334\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.870\nto put the proper IP address on the\nnetwork that has the TFTP server, okay.\n\n335\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.340\nSo that kind of is the idea of the backup\nthat we wanted to be able to see.\n\n336\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.225\nWe can store it someplace else and\nthen pull it together.\n\n337\n00:19:58.225 --> 00:20:01.945\nAll right, now Zach, we're almost\ndone with the idea of maintenance but\n\n338\n00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:04.610\nwe have to do just a couple\nof other things here.\n\n339\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.805\nI'm trying to make sure that I'm zooming\nout here too cuz it looks like I am zoomed\n\n340\n00:20:08.805 --> 00:20:10.668\nin to the max is what's happening.\n\n341\n00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:18.170\nIt says 100% but\ndarn it if I'm not completely, come on.\n\n342\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.990\nWhy is it that, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n343\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.202\nSo apparently we are going to\nbe zoomed in period, okay.\n\n344\n00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:29.310\nAll right, so Zach, let's see if I\ncan do this without causing some\n\n345\n00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.200\nlet's take a look at this, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n346\n00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.375\ndid you do that?\n&gt;&gt; I have done something like that.\n\n347\n00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:34.057\n&gt;&gt; Is that what you did?\n\n348\n00:20:34.057 --> 00:20:35.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I wanted to bring this up.\n\n349\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:41.090\nThis is from Commons Wikipedia\nhere on studio wiring and stuff.\n\n350\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.740\nSo it is possible, now-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.890\n&gt;&gt; This is the idea of wiring, okay.\n\n352\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.880\nNow if I needed to know, so just as\nan example here cuz I don't think I,\n\n353\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.370\nlet's just say I'll take the one\nthat's actually way off here,\n\n354\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:53.960\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n355\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.650\n&gt;&gt; So, Zack, this\n\n356\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.230\ncable, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n357\n00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Tell me what device do you think that\n\n358\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.700\nthat cable is plugged in\nto through that mess?\n\n359\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.300\n&gt;&gt; It's plugged into the router, Ronnie.\n\n360\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.110\n&gt;&gt; It's plugged in some\n\n361\n00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.790\nplace, right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.080\n&gt;&gt; That's the only thing that you and\n\n363\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.860\nI can do, let's just take\nthat as let's do that, okay.\n\n364\n00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.950\nSo if I were to try and do that,\nit's almost an impossibility,\n\n365\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.570\nright.\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n366\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.600\n&gt;&gt; This would take, it can be done, okay,\n\n367\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.370\nwith a lot of patience, a lot of time.\n\n368\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.520\nYou could end up tracing this thing out,\nokay, but\n\n369\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.630\nin all reality this is terrible.\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty bad.\n\n370\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.640\n&gt;&gt; It is really bad.\n\n371\n00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.838\nSo even though they think they've\nlabeled it, and you can see,\n\n372\n00:21:26.838 --> 00:21:28.360\nlook at all those labels, right.\n\n373\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.268\nSo even the labeling at\nthis point has failed.\n\n374\n00:21:31.268 --> 00:21:34.550\nOkay, so\n[LAUGH] just kind of imagine this, right.\n\n375\n00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.910\nIt's absolutely 100% failed at this point,\nokay.\n\n376\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.420\n&gt;&gt; Looks like a bowl of spaghetti you\n\n377\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.020\ndon't wanna eat.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's exactly true,\n\n378\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.720\nyou don't want to eat any of this, but-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n379\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.740\n&gt;&gt; Overall though, the reason why I wanted\n\n380\n00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.700\nto point this out is, what if we\nstill need to figure out, well what\n\n381\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.680\nthe heck is that plugged into, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n382\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.110\n&gt;&gt; Well I could just go ahead and\n\n383\n00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.110\nunplug every other device out\nhere until I clear up my mess.\n\n384\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.050\nWhat do you think, Zach?\n\n385\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.850\nYou think that would be good for\nthe rest of the network?\n\n386\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.100\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that would be good for\n\n387\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.390\nthe rest of the network at all.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\n\n388\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.770\nthe very fact that I would\nunplug everything else\n\n389\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.460\nmight lead to other issues.\n&gt;&gt; It would be\n\n390\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.060\nbad.\n&gt;&gt; It would\n\n391\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.690\nbe bad.\n&gt;&gt; It'd be bad.\n\n392\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.640\nOkay, so what can we do?\n\n393\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.070\nWhat is it that we can actually do to\nhelp us discover where devices are and\n\n394\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.670\nwhat they're connected to?\n\n395\n00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.910\nWell the great thing is we've already\ntalked about this concept earlier in our\n\n396\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.000\nseries here.\n\n397\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.820\nSo now we're just gonna\nreview the concepts of using\n\n398\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.540\nwhat we call some layer two\ninformation to help us out.\n\n399\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.040\nThat's really annoying to me,\nwhy I can't zoom back out.\n\n400\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.380\nBut we'll kind of work with\nit as we have it here and\n\n401\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.010\nwhat will end up happening, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.650\nSo as we start here, let's get back on\nNYEDGE1, we're now going to make sure that\n\n403\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:46.250\nwe can configure what we need to, which is\ngonna be what we call CDP and LLDP, okay.\n\n404\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:51.740\nNow with the CDP and LLDP, okay,\nit allows us to be able to,\n\n405\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:57.010\nwell just find out what machines\nare actually plugged in to what.\n\n406\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:01.090\nAnd that is what we want to do if\nI can get access to, there it is.\n\n407\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.600\nI was trying to get access to NYCORE1,\n\n408\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.860\nI was like,\nit's not letting me click on that icon.\n\n409\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.440\nSo let me see if I can just\nscroll down and get access to it.\n\n410\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.320\nSo we're gonna start right\n\n411\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.055\nhere at NYCORE1.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n412\n00:23:11.055 --> 00:23:12.730\n&gt;&gt; Is what we're gonna do to\n\n413\n00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.420\nfigure out what we want.\n\n414\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.750\nSo, oops, do an enable and\nnow if I do this,\n\n415\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.720\nright, CDP stands for Cisco Discovery\nProtocol, which is the protocol that is\n\n416\n00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.650\nnormally enabled by default\non a Cisco switch, okay.\n\n417\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.560\nAnd the reason why this is good is\nbecause it will communicate with\n\n418\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.530\nother Cisco devices that\nare also running CDP.\n\n419\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.145\nAnd if all those devices\nare actually running CDP,\n\n420\n00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:41.200\nthey'ill exchange a lot\nof good information.\n\n421\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.780\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n422\n00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.050\nCDP, show cdp neighbors.\n\n423\n00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.795\nShow cdp neighbors.\n\n424\n00:23:52.795 --> 00:23:54.320\nGo figure.\n\n425\n00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:59.936\nAll right, And\nnow that I've got it above my head here,\n\n426\n00:23:59.936 --> 00:24:02.335\nthis should help us a little bit more.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n427\n00:24:02.335 --> 00:24:05.195\n&gt;&gt; Now you can see where the other devices\n\n428\n00:24:05.195 --> 00:24:07.973\nthat have CDP enabled and turned on.\n\n429\n00:24:07.973 --> 00:24:10.186\nLook at all the information\nI get access to.\n\n430\n00:24:10.186 --> 00:24:13.110\nOkay, I have their device ID name.\n\n431\n00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:17.120\nAnd that comes when we set a host\nname on each of the devices.\n\n432\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:24.770\nSo I'm connected to NYACCESS1, NYEDGE1,\nNYCORE2, NYCORE2 on two interfaces.\n\n433\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:29.610\nI can see on my router here, or\nactually on core, is actually a switcher.\n\n434\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:35.386\nOn this switch,\nI'm connecting NYACCESS1 on 1/0/22, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:38.370\nAnd it also has a hold timer as well,\nokay?\n\n436\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.090\nThat says, hey, this information\nis valid for this long, and\n\n437\n00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.590\nI can even see that this\nswitch is a switch.\n\n438\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.489\nAnd also the I here means it can run\n\n439\n00:24:49.489 --> 00:24:55.010\nan interior gateway management protocol.\n\n440\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.050\nJust wanna make sure I'm\ntelling you right as I can see.\n\n441\n00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.920\nAlso, I can see the hardware platform.\n\n442\n00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:07.260\nThis is a Cisco 2960, and on the other\nend of this device then, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:14.752\nIt is connecting to\nNYACCESS1 to this port.\n\n444\n00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:16.960\nI was trying to make sure I said that one,\nokay?\n\n445\n00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.970\nThose connecting over to\nthat port on NYACCESS1.\n\n446\n00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.254\nThat's a lot of good information.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n447\n00:25:21.254 --> 00:25:23.988\n&gt;&gt; Cuz now, if I have a router here,\n\n448\n00:25:23.988 --> 00:25:25.100\nright.\n\n449\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.030\nSo let's say that I did CDP on this guy.\n\n450\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:33.770\nI know it's not Cisco but bear with me\nin my showing us something here right.\n\n451\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.440\nAnd I knew where that Cisco 2960 was.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n452\n00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.995\n&gt;&gt; That had that name NYACCESS1, and\n\n453\n00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:43.656\nthen I would go and look for\nthat device in here, and\n\n454\n00:25:43.656 --> 00:25:46.222\nthen figure out by going all right.\n\n455\n00:25:46.222 --> 00:25:50.594\nSo over on fast ethernet 24,\nthat's what I'm connected to, and\n\n456\n00:25:50.594 --> 00:25:54.360\nI could actually identify\nthat very easily, okay?\n\n457\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.990\nSo being able to do something like this\n\n458\n00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.294\ndoes help out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n459\n00:25:57.294 --> 00:25:59.322\n&gt;&gt; Now we can even see some more entry\n\n460\n00:25:59.322 --> 00:26:01.030\ninformation here.\n\n461\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:08.311\nIf I do a show cdp entry, and\nthen let's just do NYEDGE1.\n\n462\n00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:13.490\nPress Enter.\n\n463\n00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.430\nIf I choose to do this,\n\n464\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.760\nnotice the more detailed entry\nthat I have available to me.\n\n465\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.170\nNow all this works on layer two,\nonce again, we've reviewed this before.\n\n466\n00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.170\nAnd you're now actually seeing where it's\neven giving me some other information.\n\n467\n00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.940\nSo it's even reporting layer three\ninformation, which is kind of neat.\n\n468\n00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.780\nYou don't normally expect that.\n\n469\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.790\nBut there we go.\n\n470\n00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:38.190\nSo you're getting a lot of different\ninformation on our connection NYEDGE1.\n\n471\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:44.610\nAnd there's the whole time even the Cisco\niOS software that this device is running.\n\n472\n00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.960\nAnd management you name it,\nthere's a lot of information for us.\n\n473\n00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.880\nLet's check out one more here.\n\n474\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.104\nShow cdp traffic.\n\n475\n00:26:55.131 --> 00:26:59.057\nWith the show cdp traffic here,\nwe're seeing that there's actually two\n\n476\n00:26:59.057 --> 00:27:02.940\ndifferent versions of CDP,\nI can clearly see I'm running version two.\n\n477\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.680\nThe way that I know that is because\nI'm getting inputs and outputs on it.\n\n478\n00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.270\nNotice that the version\none advertisements zero.\n\n479\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.670\nSo that's probably not\nthe one that I'm running.\n\n480\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.190\nBut you can also see\nthat's what's happened.\n\n481\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.791\nSo if you're actually running CDP and\nyou're not getting any traffic coming in,\n\n482\n00:27:19.791 --> 00:27:21.402\nI would check the other end.\n\n483\n00:27:21.402 --> 00:27:26.370\nSo like NYACCESS1 or NYEDGE1 and\ngo, hey, I probably need to\n\n484\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.890\nenable CDP on that particular\nrouter if I choose to do so, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.220\nSo that's what you can\nalso end up doing as well.\n\n486\n00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.490\nNow, you can set the different timer\ndifferently, okay if you choose to.\n\n487\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.540\nEvery once in a while,\n\n488\n00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.810\nthis is communicating just about every\nminute as what we're normally seeing it.\n\n489\n00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.330\nSo if I wanted to, I could configure.\n\n490\n00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:58.030\nGet into the global configuration mode,\nthe cdp timers.\n\n491\n00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.570\nAnd let's take a look at that for\na moment.\n\n492\n00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.580\nNotice that this one actually does\nit in terms of second tier and\n\n493\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.510\nthe rate in which they're sent.\n\n494\n00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.050\nSo at this particular rate in which\ncdp packets are sent, I think\n\n495\n00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:16.500\nthe default is 300 seconds which is five\nminutes, if I remember correctly, okay?\n\n496\n00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.640\nSo if you wanted to do this,\n\n497\n00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.170\nyou could reset this as a time\nto make it happen more often.\n\n498\n00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:27.083\nSo here in our lab,\nthey have us doing cdp timer 70.\n\n499\n00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:31.441\nRemember that this is in terms of seconds,\nso about every minute and\n\n500\n00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:36.115\nten seconds, we can change the hold\ntime for how long before it drops it.\n\n501\n00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.660\nAnd they're doing 120,\n\n502\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.960\nhere, instead of whatever we\nhad actually had it set up for.\n\n503\n00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.910\nSo this actually helps us out.\n\n504\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.470\nNow what's the hold time about?\n\n505\n00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.690\nIf the other side drops off,\njust reboot it or something, right.\n\n506\n00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.780\nIt says hey, I'm still connected to it and\nthis is gonna be valid for a 120 seconds.\n\n507\n00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.210\nWhat is it expecting is that\na reboot could have happened.\n\n508\n00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.910\nSo I still wanna make that connection,\nI still want this to be valid and\n\n509\n00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.750\ntrue just in case that\ndevice comes up faster.\n\n510\n00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.550\nI don't want it to drop the information\nand then have to rediscover.\n\n511\n00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.010\nI'll just leave this here for\nthis point in time and\n\n512\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.598\nso if the timer drops off, right?\n\n513\n00:29:14.598 --> 00:29:19.013\nSo it's gonna send it every 70 seconds but\nit's gonna hold on to it.\n\n514\n00:29:19.013 --> 00:29:23.508\nSo for 120 seconds at this point,\nif I don't hear something,\n\n515\n00:29:23.508 --> 00:29:28.102\nthen I'll drop it and\nwe'll have to rediscover the information.\n\n516\n00:29:28.102 --> 00:29:32.320\nAll right, so fairly valuable\ninformation as you start seeing that.\n\n517\n00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:40.210\nAnd then of course globally here, show\njust cdp is always a good command as well.\n\n518\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.230\nAnd this way you verify that\nyour changes have been made\n\n519\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.790\nthe way that you think that\nthey should be made here.\n\n520\n00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.042\nAnd you want these to match on both ends,\nis what you wanna make sure that you do.\n\n521\n00:29:50.042 --> 00:29:54.380\nAll right, so that's good, as long as you\nhave every device that's actually CDP.\n\n522\n00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.150\nOkay, so once you get that,\nyou're perfectly fine.\n\n523\n00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.710\nThere's also LLDP, which is the link\nlayer discovery protocol, and\n\n524\n00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.840\nwe did go over that again,\nin an earlier episode as well.\n\n525\n00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.560\nSo that, again, will actually\nrun just about the same thing.\n\n526\n00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.830\nWe're only gonna do a couple of them.\n\n527\n00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.380\nBecause we are running\nright out of time here.\n\n528\n00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.610\nBut let me just get two more in here,\nokay.\n\n529\n00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.400\nSo make sure that you remember\nthat if you wanted to\n\n530\n00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.950\nconfigure either one of these, right?\n\n531\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:28.570\nOnce you get in global configuration mode,\nyou might wanna enable cdp, it's cdp run.\n\n532\n00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:35.250\nBut if I wanna disable it, it's actually\nno cdp run, and that will disable cdp.\n\n533\n00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.070\nSo what about LLDP, which is\nthe link layer discovery protocol?\n\n534\n00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.560\nLLDP, to enable it is run as well.\n\n535\n00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.050\nAnd then you turn that on, and\nonce you start turning that on,\n\n536\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.620\nthen you have to turn it\non on the other devices.\n\n537\n00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.450\nSo why would I choose LLDP?\n\n538\n00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.650\nBecause I'm running on,\nwell, various platforms.\n\n539\n00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:57.290\nAnd I have Juniper Routers and\nother routers that are actually\n\n540\n00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.130\nout there that run LLDP,\nHP switches stuff like that.\n\n541\n00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:06.560\nWell, LLDP is probably the one that you'll\nactually end up picking up if you do that.\n\n542\n00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.430\nBut all the commands\nare relatively the same.\n\n543\n00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.930\nYou change LLDP timer by LLDP timer,\nsetting the time for\n\n544\n00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.100\nthem, doing what you want to as well.\n\n545\n00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.390\nAnd then, of course, you can show that.\n\n546\n00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:24.500\nLet's do a, just one more show command,\nshow lldp here.\n\n547\n00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.260\nWe'll take a look and\nnow you'll see here's the global status.\n\n548\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.801\nIt is active and lldp kinda cuts\neverything in half, notice advertisements.\n\n549\n00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:39.780\nSo every 30 seconds, but its hold time\nis about 120 seconds as well, okay?\n\n550\n00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.540\nSo there's a lot of\ninformation right here.\n\n551\n00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.990\nBut just make sure you review this concept\nagain, because we did go over it a little\n\n552\n00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.010\nbit earlier in our series here, but\nthis is a final review for this.\n\n553\n00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.620\nAll right Zach, so\n\n554\n00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.440\nthat's the basics of the device\nmanagement that we're talking about here.\n\n555\n00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.590\nAnd that should be enough\ninformation to get you started and\n\n556\n00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.590\nto keep you busy for a little bit of time.\n&gt;&gt; Configure device management,\n\n557\n00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.280\nanother wonderful episode filled with\na plethora of information you could use.\n\n558\n00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.270\nRonnie, before we move on,\n\n559\n00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.739\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well, reviewing is key,\n\n560\n00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:09.484\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n561\n00:32:09.484 --> 00:32:11.609\n&gt;&gt; So on these topics that you feel\n\n562\n00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:15.960\nconfident with, do not spend\nanymore time on than you need to.\n\n563\n00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.700\nNow what I don't mean is skip over it,\nright?\n\n564\n00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.610\nI mean review it, make sure you go,\nI know this topic, okay?\n\n565\n00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.182\nSpend more time at this point, if you're\ngoing through in the series in the order\n\n566\n00:32:26.182 --> 00:32:27.872\nthat it's appearing on the website.\n\n567\n00:32:27.872 --> 00:32:29.733\nIf you're doing that, okay,\n\n568\n00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:34.110\nmake sure you spend more time on\nthe topics you're confused by.\n\n569\n00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.080\nAnd study those and\nmake sure you run those configurations and\n\n570\n00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.730\nthat you're practicing of course,\nworking with the routers and\n\n571\n00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.470\nswitches on a daily basis.\n&gt;&gt; Great advice Ronnie, and\n\n572\n00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.210\nit's a great series, Cisco CCENT.\n\n573\n00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.690\nMake sure you watch every episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n574\n00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.680\nAnd you'll be in the course library\nwhere there's thousands of other

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:07.853\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:12.390\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n5\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.360\nthank you for watching ITProTV\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.120\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of Cisco CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.150\nWe're gonna be implementing\ninitial device hardening.\n\n8\n00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.900\nYes, we are.\n\n9\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.715\nAnd the person doing that for\nus is Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:26.730\nRonnie, good to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.543\nThank you so much.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Zach, for\n\n12\n00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:31.759\njoining me once again as we\ncontinue on in our CCENT journey.\n\n13\n00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.535\nRemember that we are now in our fifth\ntopic overall when you are preparing for\n\n14\n00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.630\nthe CCENT.\n\n15\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.290\nWe're taking a look at\nthe infrastructure in maintenance and\n\n16\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.900\ntoday we get to talk\nabout device hardening.\n\n17\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.230\nNow the great thing is,\n\n18\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.770\nas we began in the networking\nfundamentals we did cover this topic.\n\n19\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.040\nBut we covered it in brief portions of it.\n\n20\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.198\nWe've talked about some of\nthem probably more in depth.\n\n21\n00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:56.600\nBut we wanna do a little bit of review,\n\n22\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.100\nbecause this is where the rubber\nstarts hitting the road.\n\n23\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.580\nFor you taking the skills that\nyou've learned during this show and\n\n24\n00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.990\nthen applying it into real life.\n\n25\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380\nSo that is what we're also doing as well,\nand we need to talk about this idea of\n\n26\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.523\ndevice hardening.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n27\n00:01:11.523 --> 00:01:13.059\n&gt;&gt; One of the issues that you're hearing\n\n28\n00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:15.075\nabout today,\nwhether you're reading about it or\n\n29\n00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.713\nusually when you're reading about it.\n\n30\n00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:20.959\nOf course on the Internet, on blogs and\ndifferent tech sites that's out there,\n\n31\n00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.714\nis that the devices that\npeople are buying, right?\n\n32\n00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:26.675\nIs that they buy it,\nput it right out of the box and\n\n33\n00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.180\nthey just put it into production.\n\n34\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.270\nBut they don't reconfigure it.\n\n35\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.620\nThey don't do anything.\n\n36\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.770\nAnd that means that the device, whatever\nvulnerabilities happened at the factory,\n\n37\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.130\nit also gets carried into your\nproduction network as well.\n\n38\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.317\nAnd Cisco usually, it does a good\njob on the majority of this and\n\n39\n00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:48.068\nit's because policies have changed\nover time and it's done this way.\n\n40\n00:01:48.068 --> 00:01:52.228\nBut to give you an example of\na device in which it's designed for\n\n41\n00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:54.908\ntrue productivity right out of the box.\n\n42\n00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.421\nAnd I mentioned this over and\n\n43\n00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:59.321\nover again during the entire\nshow is that when you go and\n\n44\n00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:04.020\nbuy a Cisco Switch right out of the box,\nall you have to do is plug power into it.\n\n45\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.428\nAll of the ports are on by default,\nonce everything settles down.\n\n46\n00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:11.549\nSo you don't have to implement a password,\nyou don't have to configure anything.\n\n47\n00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.742\nA switch will work just as\na switch right out of the box\n\n48\n00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:17.500\nwith no configuration at all.\n\n49\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.810\nSo does that sound like bad?\n\n50\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.940\nNo, you're saying, hey,\nthat's great for productivity, but\n\n51\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.200\nit is bad, because if you now\nhave one of those switches,\n\n52\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.680\nwhich there are a lot of ports on,\nyou have a lot of empty ports.\n\n53\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.220\nIt also means that there is a chance then,\nthat somebody\n\n54\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.930\nelse could come along that's a little\nbit more malicious as an attacker and\n\n55\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.030\nthey could plugin to\nany one of those ports.\n\n56\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.650\nAnd they would be on and they would\nactually get access into your network.\n\n57\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.570\nSo just by you not having some type of\nsecurity implemented on devices like that,\n\n58\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.230\nyou may want to consider and\nyou may want to take a look at, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.050\nThe other part, though, is like routers.\n\n60\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.590\nRouters implement a little bit more\nsecurity, in the very fact that when you\n\n61\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.310\nfirst turn them on,\nyou have to do some basic configuration.\n\n62\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.660\nSo if you don't know what that\nconfiguration, that's gonna stop you.\n\n63\n00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960\nAnd I'm not telling you that's\na true security measure, but\n\n64\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.660\nit's a security measure just by default.\n\n65\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.412\nBut if you don't how to configure it,\nyou'll not gonna be able to use it.\n\n66\n00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:15.231\nBut secondly, the other part is,\neven if you configure it, the force,\n\n67\n00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:18.470\nthe physical force on\nrouters are normally off.\n\n68\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.030\nIn other words,\nthey're shutdown by default.\n\n69\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.670\nAnd then you have to turn them on by\nissuing a no shutdown command to be able\n\n70\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.475\nto have traffic flow through them.\n\n71\n00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:29.500\nWell today, we're not only\ntalking about things like that,\n\n72\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.535\nwhich we've covered before\nthroughout this entire series.\n\n73\n00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:36.959\nBut we also wanna make sure that\nwe review some of the additional\n\n74\n00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.547\nthings that we can do, as of course,\n\n75\n00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:44.481\na Cisco professional to well properly\nsecure devices as well, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:47.492\nSo today, instead of just using the labs,\n\n77\n00:03:47.492 --> 00:03:53.362\nbecause there is no official practice labs\nenvironment for us to do this on, okay?\n\n78\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:57.485\nWhat we actually are gonna do is were\ndoing to use a real router, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:01.000\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\nI'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n80\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.665\nSo I am consoled into a real\nrouter at this point and\n\n81\n00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:07.928\nif you were watching this show at the very\nbeginning, I showed you this router.\n\n82\n00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:10.285\nIt's a Cisco 3845 router.\n\n83\n00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:14.258\nI've kinda cleared off the config,\nso that we can start clean and\n\n84\n00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:15.724\nfresh with this one.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n85\n00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:17.257\n&gt;&gt; As we start off here.\n\n86\n00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.988\nBut if I were to put that into\na network and get it ready to go,\n\n87\n00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:26.081\nwhat are some of the things that I'd want\nto configure just for basic hardening?\n\n88\n00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.650\nNow, we're not doing\nsuper advanced hardening.\n\n89\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.540\nWhen you start talking about that,\nyou're going and you're turning off\n\n90\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.600\ndifferent protocols that you may not use\nand you may do all that other stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.160\nAnd that's something\nyou may wanna consider,\n\n92\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.230\nand there's plenty of\nCisco guides out there.\n\n93\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.260\nBut in this one, we're just doing the\nbasic ones that are really called out for\n\n94\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.779\nthe exam.\n&gt;&gt; Right, the initial hardening.\n\n95\n00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:44.953\n&gt;&gt; Initial hardening,\n\n96\n00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:45.768\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n97\n00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:46.317\n&gt;&gt; So Zach,\n\n98\n00:04:46.317 --> 00:04:48.931\nlet's talk about this\nidea of getting access\n\n99\n00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.800\ninto the router itself.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n100\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.540\n&gt;&gt; So right now,\n\n101\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.740\nthere's nothing actually on this router.\n\n102\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.190\nSo normally when you first start it up,\nokay and\n\n103\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.650\nit finishes its boot up process,\nyou end up seeing one of two things.\n\n104\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.640\nUsually it'll ask you, do you wanna\ngo ahead and configure this, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.874\nAnd it'll give you a chance\nto walk through a menu.\n\n106\n00:05:04.874 --> 00:05:07.564\nSo if you do that you just\nanswers the questions and\n\n107\n00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:10.770\nthen you'll have a pretty\nconfigured router ready to go and\n\n108\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.120\nready to be put into basic use,\nbut not anything else, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.163\nAnd they even do a little bit\ninitial device hardening for you.\n\n110\n00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:21.849\nBut I choose the word no instead and when\nI did that it dropped me right out here at\n\n111\n00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.470\nthe prompt that says router at this\npoint and that's all that we want, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.270\nWe wanted to actually be right here.\n\n113\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.640\nSo there's no real configuration.\n\n114\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.860\nNotice the host name\nis just called Router.\n\n115\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.560\nEverything else is actually right here.\n\n116\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.760\nSo let's go ahead and start some\nconfiguration that we might wanna add in.\n\n117\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.960\nBecause if I try to get access in from\nthe user mode here, I need to type in,\n\n118\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.840\noops, if I can type it in here, enable.\n\n119\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.430\nWell, notice that it didn't require\nanything of me to do that, right?\n\n120\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.876\nI just type in enable the command that\ngets me into the privileged user mode or\n\n121\n00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:56.037\nthe privileged exec mode.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n122\n00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:57.829\n&gt;&gt; And that means I was able to change\n\n123\n00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:02.062\nwhat I can see and what I can do into this\nprivileged mode without any commands.\n\n124\n00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:08.297\nSo what we might wanna do is\nimplement basic authentication, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:08.297 --> 00:06:13.116\nNow, in the most basic authentication\nthat there is, is just asking for\n\n126\n00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:16.640\na password when we start to\ntake a look at that idea.\n\n127\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.497\nNow, when we start doing that, right?\n\n128\n00:06:18.497 --> 00:06:20.090\nBasical authentication is saying,\n\n129\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.260\ndo you know what the password is\nto gain access in to this device?\n\n130\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.750\nSo we can set something like that up,\nso let me show you how to do that.\n\n131\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.200\nSo this is just a reminder.\n\n132\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.890\nSo the password that I want is a password\nthat when you type in this word,\n\n133\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.110\nenable to bring you into\nthe privilege exec mode,\n\n134\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.280\nit's gonna require a password instead,\nokay?\n\n135\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.080\nSo the way that we do that\nis we type in enable and\n\n136\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.940\nthen a very simple password and\nwe're just gonna use Cisco as an example.\n\n137\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.690\nAnd there we go.\n\n138\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.988\nSo now I have a password set for me.\n\n139\n00:06:48.988 --> 00:06:54.183\nAnd what I wanna do here\nis I wanna go ahead and\n\n140\n00:06:54.183 --> 00:06:59.670\ndo a copy running-config startup-config.\n\n141\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.403\nIf I spelled everything right, I'm okay.\n\n142\n00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:03.680\nAnd then we'll press Enter.\n\n143\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.590\nSo I just saved my initial configuration\nhere, the only thing that Ashley\n\n144\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.980\ndid here was implement some\ntype of basic authentication.\n\n145\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.220\nSo if I exit out of this and it kicks\nme out now to the user mode again.\n\n146\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.940\nNow when I come back here,\nI'm back to the user mode.\n\n147\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.050\nI type in enable, well,\nnow notice it asks me for a password.\n\n148\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.680\nSo then I just type in my password and\nwe're just gonna use Cisco here.\n\n149\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.800\nAnd there we go.\n\n150\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.940\nSo that's basic, basic,\nbasic authentication.\n\n151\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.190\nNow, the problem with that though is, what\nthat means that if I tell Zach one time,\n\n152\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.330\nZach here's the password to\nget access into this router.\n\n153\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.073\nWell, Zack may not even know, but he goes\naround he starts talking about, hey,\n\n154\n00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:50.337\nI know what the password is to\nthe router that Ronnie's configuring.\n\n155\n00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:54.496\nWell, Zach may have an unintentionally\nI hope, not intentionally,\n\n156\n00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:57.210\npassed that password to somebody else.\n\n157\n00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.574\nAnd I can just say Zach was the only\none that knew the password.\n\n158\n00:08:00.574 --> 00:08:03.436\nWell Zach can say,\nI knew what the password was but\n\n159\n00:08:03.436 --> 00:08:05.080\nI didn't touch the router.\n\n160\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.401\nAnd Zach may honestly have\nnever touched that router, but\n\n161\n00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.926\nsomebody is still gaining access in, why?\n\n162\n00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:15.676\nBecause Zach or myself we just happened to\nshare the password and that gets in, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:18.560\nSo that's a problem that\nwe might end up having.\n\n164\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.340\nSo how can we stop that?\n\n165\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.581\nWell, what we want to do is we want\nto implement what we call local\n\n166\n00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:25.850\nauthentication.\n\n167\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.794\nNow, this is just on that one word, right?\n\n168\n00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:32.469\nEnable and\nyou saw me where I said enable and\n\n169\n00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.603\nthen password, and\nthen we could do that, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:35.603 --> 00:08:41.616\nBut what if I wanted this to actually be\nwhere it required a username and password?\n\n171\n00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:44.712\nSo, that username and\npassword believe it or not,\n\n172\n00:08:44.712 --> 00:08:47.313\nis considered advanced authentication.\n\n173\n00:08:47.313 --> 00:08:49.253\nIt doesn't sound advanced today.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n174\n00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:50.719\n&gt;&gt; But when they first implemented it,\n\n175\n00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:53.450\nit was actually advanced\nauthentication at that point.\n\n176\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.940\nSo, and technically in the Cisco realm,\nthey called it\n\n177\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.920\nthe New Model Authentication,\nis what they ended up calling it.\n\n178\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.540\nSo now, let's say that what\nwe want to do is we wanna\n\n179\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.990\nactually do a new model password instead,\nokay?\n\n180\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.370\nSo the way that we do that is\nnow back on the router itself.\n\n181\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.255\nI want to create just a simple\nusername and password database.\n\n182\n00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:20.160\nThat's the easiest way to describe it,\nit's just a simple username and\n\n183\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.217\npassword database here.\n\n184\n00:09:21.217 --> 00:09:26.320\nSo if I do this, I just type in username,\nand I'll just do Ronnie for right now.\n\n185\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.870\nAnd then with the password, we're just\ngonna stick to Cisco cuz it makes it easy.\n\n186\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.860\nNow, you in real production,\nyou shouldn't do that,\n\n187\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.940\nshouldn't use a simple password,\nshould be using something more complex,\n\n188\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.010\nbut that is the example,\nwe'll just do this.\n\n189\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.150\nI can do that.\n\n190\n00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.800\nI can also go to username,\nand then we'll do Zach.\n\n191\n00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.890\nAnd then whatever password\nthat I want to set for Zach,\n\n192\n00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.060\nI'm just gonna do the same thing here.\n\n193\n00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.660\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n194\n00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.462\nNow that I have that,\nwell what do we want to do?\n\n195\n00:09:53.462 --> 00:09:57.520\nWe wanna make sure that these are the only\ntwo that are actual able to get back in\n\n196\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.150\nas we do something like this as well,\nokay?\n\n197\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.770\nSo now when we start to take a look at\ndoing something like this, well now\n\n198\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.500\nit becomes a little bit more challenging,\nat least it should when we do this.\n\n199\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.587\nSo, let me make sure that I\ndo this right as well, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:14.587 --> 00:10:15.517\nSo for you and me,\n\n201\n00:10:15.517 --> 00:10:19.191\nthere is two ways that we normally\naccess something like this, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:20.376\nSo on the router,\n\n203\n00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:25.354\nnotice that the way that am connecting\nright here is cancel zero., Okay.\n\n204\n00:10:25.354 --> 00:10:28.438\nSo that is my connection\nto what we're seeing here.\n\n205\n00:10:28.438 --> 00:10:34.627\nSo if I get access into line con0, okay?\n\n206\n00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:41.509\nLine Con space 0, there we go.\n\n207\n00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:42.786\nIt's like why is that?\n\n208\n00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:44.528\nIf for one reason or\nanother it doesn't like that.\n\n209\n00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:47.740\nBut there is only one console line,\nwhich is line console 0.\n\n210\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.591\nThen what I can do instead is\nactually type in login local.\n\n211\n00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:57.672\nSo I'm telling it don't just use\na password that's been set like\n\n212\n00:10:57.672 --> 00:11:00.563\nthe enable password, but\nuse the username and\n\n213\n00:11:00.563 --> 00:11:05.031\npassword database that I just created\nwith the two lines above, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:08.940\nSo now, let me go ahead and\nexit out of this again.\n\n215\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.350\nAnd now we're back at the user privilege\nmode, and look at what happens right away.\n\n216\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:19.050\nNow it's asking me for a User Access\nVerification, which means the username.\n\n217\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.630\nSo Zach, I'll type in Zach and\nI type in the password for\n\n218\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.820\nZach, now he's able to get in.\n\n219\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.180\nNow, this doesn't bypass anything.\n\n220\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.420\nIf I do enable, notice I still need what?\n\n221\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.410\nMy enable password to\nbe able to get in too.\n\n222\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.378\nSo we've set it up in two\ndifferent levels here, right?\n\n223\n00:11:35.378 --> 00:11:38.159\nWhere we're saying hey,\nthis is how secure we can get.\n\n224\n00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:42.683\nSo by doing something just that simple,\nwhat we can do is this, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:42.683 --> 00:11:44.330\nIs actually have that setup.\n\n226\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.080\nSo it's a really neat little system.\n\n227\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.490\nLater on as you go towards\nyour CCNA routing and\n\n228\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.740\nswitching as your CCNA security,\nyou'll see how to move that username and\n\n229\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.640\npassword database off to\na different system, to be able\n\n230\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.440\nto handle the authentication from another\ndevice which makes it even more secure.\n\n231\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.545\nBut at this point, this is what we wanna\nmake sure that we understand and know.\n\n232\n00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:06.196\nSo basic here, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:06.196 --> 00:12:08.220\nAll right, so\nlet me go ahead and do a copy.\n\n234\n00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:16.413\nRunning-config startup-config.\n\n235\n00:12:16.413 --> 00:12:20.274\nAnd make sure I save my\nchanges here as we move on.\n\n236\n00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:25.652\nAll right, so now that I've got these\nchanges saved, let's go ahead and\n\n237\n00:12:25.652 --> 00:12:31.750\ndo a show running-config, And lets take\na look at what we've changed so far.\n\n238\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.370\nSo there's a lot of different\npieces to this as well.\n\n239\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.660\nAnd you can see right here,\nlook at this Zack.\n\n240\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.741\nAnd when I look at\nthe running configuration,\n\n241\n00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:43.986\nI can see what the password is right away,\nokay?\n\n242\n00:12:43.986 --> 00:12:48.144\nIf I scroll down a little bit more,\nnotice it says no new model yet\n\n243\n00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:53.110\nbecause we're not actually using\nanything else, but look at this, Zach.\n\n244\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.450\nI can also see not only the username, but\nthe password's listed here too, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.896\nSo, we're actually able\nto see all of that, and\n\n246\n00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:01.992\nthat's actually pretty bad at this point.\n\n247\n00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:04.905\nSo, how do we make this\nsomething that is secret?\n\n248\n00:13:04.905 --> 00:13:06.281\nIs what we're actually\ntalking about at this point.\n\n249\n00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:07.177\n&gt;&gt; Or invisible.\n\n250\n00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:08.882\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, we can't make it invisible,\n\n251\n00:13:08.882 --> 00:13:10.552\nbut we can actually hide it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n252\n00:13:10.552 --> 00:13:12.692\n&gt;&gt; We can obscure it in a way is what we\n\n253\n00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:13.691\ncan do, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:15.287\nNow, there's a couple\nthings I want to obscure.\n\n255\n00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:21.210\nOne, I want to change\nthe enable password here, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.280\nSo, enable password,\nI can hide that password, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.110\nBut there's a better way to do that.\n\n258\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.140\nNow let's get into our global config.\n\n259\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.061\nInside the global configuration,\n\n260\n00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:37.040\nthe way that we can hide the enable\npassword better, is to type in enable.\n\n261\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.567\nAnd let me do a question\nmark here just for a moment.\n\n262\n00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:44.199\nInstead of using the word password,\nwe're gonna use the word secret.\n\n263\n00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:48.975\nAnd now, notice it says the signs,\nthe privilege levels secret instead.\n\n264\n00:13:48.975 --> 00:13:50.255\nNow notice the one above it?\n\n265\n00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:53.960\nIt says signs privilege level password.\n\n266\n00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.631\nIt's really doing the same thing.\n\n267\n00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:59.690\nBut instead, what we're doing now is\nwe're securing the password here.\n\n268\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:06.660\nSo, I can type in enable secret, and\nwe'll just use Cisco as an example again.\n\n269\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.930\nAnd now notice it says hey, are you\nsure you want to use the same password?\n\n270\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.302\nI'm sure at this point, but know you\nshouldn't use the same exact password, so\n\n271\n00:14:14.302 --> 00:14:16.764\nthat's want you to be able to do here,\nokay?\n\n272\n00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:18.705\nThis is not recommended,\n\n273\n00:14:18.705 --> 00:14:23.124\nif you want to reenter the enable\nsecret command to do that.\n\n274\n00:14:23.124 --> 00:14:26.620\nThat's perfectly fine for\nright now, we our good with us.\n\n275\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.796\nNow, let's do this.\n\n276\n00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:33.047\nDo show run, and now and now let's\ntake a look at the enable password,\n\n277\n00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:38.042\nand what we're focusing on in of\ncourse Is right down here, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:38.835\nSo now, Zach,\n\n279\n00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:42.445\nlook at the difference between\nthe two passwords that you see, okay?\n\n280\n00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:45.209\nWell, notice that here's\nour enabled password,\n\n281\n00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:47.373\nthe one that's in clear text.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n282\n00:14:47.373 --> 00:14:49.527\n&gt;&gt; Notice this one though, that's not\n\n283\n00:14:49.527 --> 00:14:52.747\nexactly in clearer text anymore, okay?.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n284\n00:14:52.747 --> 00:14:54.508\n&gt;&gt; So that's a little bit more jumbled\n\n285\n00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:55.290\nup, right?\n\n286\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.940\nAnd that's because it took that\nsecret that we call Cisco,\n\n287\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.770\nand it ran it through\nanother hatching algorithm.\n\n288\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.410\nNow, not only did it do that,\nit also salted this value.\n\n289\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.770\nNow, that doesn't mean much to you and me\nif we don't understand what that term is.\n\n290\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.163\nBut the idea of salting is it added in\nsome additional characters to make it even\n\n291\n00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:16.638\nmore difficult to crack.\n\n292\n00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:22.110\nSo notice that there's this $ here, and\nthis $ here, and another $ right here.\n\n293\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.826\nWell, those are markers\nabout that additional stuff\n\n294\n00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:28.292\nthat it decided to add there.\n&gt;&gt; So going secret's like an encryption of\n\n295\n00:15:28.292 --> 00:15:29.500\nsorts?\n&gt;&gt; It is an encryption, okay?\n\n296\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.268\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n297\n00:15:30.268 --> 00:15:31.582\n&gt;&gt; So this is actually a stronger\n\n298\n00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:33.770\nencryption, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, the problem though Zach\n\n300\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.710\nis that is that even my running\nconfig right here, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.250\nYou're still able if you walk by and\n\n302\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.810\nI was doing this, you could still do\nwhat we call shoulder surfing, right?\n\n303\n00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.412\nYou could still see that my username,\npasswords,\n\n304\n00:15:45.412 --> 00:15:48.932\nas well as the enabled password\nthey're still in clear text, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:48.932 --> 00:15:49.995\nWhich means you can read them.\n\n306\n00:15:49.995 --> 00:15:55.125\nSo how do I clear that up, how do I\naddress that issue here as I go through?\n\n307\n00:15:55.125 --> 00:16:01.412\nThe easiest way to do this is\nto instead issue this command,\n\n308\n00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:05.950\nwhich is service password-encryption.\n\n309\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.916\nAnd now, if I do the same thing, do show\nrun, using the abbreviated form here,\n\n310\n00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:13.790\nnow take a look at the difference, Zach.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n312\n00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.540\nSo now, you can see that it\ndid end up changing that, and\n\n313\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.170\nthere is now this one, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.080\nNow, you can tell just\nby the very length of it\n\n315\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.210\nthat this would be easier to crack than\nthe one that's above it here, okay?\n\n316\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.140\nThe great thing about most of\nthe CISCO devices today is that\n\n317\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.550\nif you have both of these configured,\nit's gonna choose the more secure one for\n\n318\n00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.780\nyou to enter in, okay,\nis what it's going to do.\n\n319\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.320\nSo it may, it says hey, look,\nwe'll override this one, and\n\n320\n00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.130\nwe'll make sure that you enter this\none in instead, is what you can do.\n\n321\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.390\nAnd now, take a look.\n\n322\n00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.118\nHere it is again.\n\n323\n00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:54.880\nNow notice, Zach, you and\nI, when I entered this in,\n\n324\n00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.590\nright, the password that you and\nI entered in was what, Cisco, okay?\n\n325\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.770\nFor your account and for mine, right?\n\n326\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.230\nBut notice the number, Zach.\n\n327\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.577\nWhat do you notice about those numbers?\n\n328\n00:17:07.577 --> 00:17:09.555\nThey are different, right?\n&gt;&gt; They are different.\n\n329\n00:17:09.555 --> 00:17:11.854\n&gt;&gt; So it's the same password.\n\n330\n00:17:11.854 --> 00:17:16.035\nSo we use the same encryption,\nthat service password as encryption.\n\n331\n00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:17.825\nWell, what the heck is this about?\n\n332\n00:17:17.825 --> 00:17:20.895\nHow do we end up with\ndifferent numbers and letters?\n\n333\n00:17:20.895 --> 00:17:23.505\nAnd this is what makes it\na little bit trickier.\n\n334\n00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:25.730\nBut it is not tricky enough.\n\n335\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.810\nA password like this, right,\nas long as you actually have this number,\n\n336\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:36.200\nright here, okay, it can actually\nregenerate that password for you as well.\n\n337\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.650\nSo it doesn't take long because they\nknow what the hashing algorithm is.\n\n338\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.680\nAnd you see that number 7 right there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n339\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.740\n&gt;&gt; That is called that level seven\n\n340\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.780\npassword encryption which is\nvery easy to run through.\n\n341\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:51.520\nAnd if I compare that to here on\nenable secret, notice this is a 5.\n\n342\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.860\nWell, a level five password encryption,\nwhich is short for MD5 hash,\n\n343\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.820\nis much stronger than the level seven one,\nis what you'll actually see.\n\n344\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.880\nSo that one prevents somebody from\nlooking over the shoulder and\n\n345\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.980\nguessing what the password may be.\n\n346\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:13.620\nBut a 5, though, you cannot be sure, okay,\neven trying to run that through today.\n\n347\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.930\nIt's still difficult to do so.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n\n348\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.070\n&gt;&gt; So it makes it harder for\n\n349\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.560\nsomeone to be able to break.\n\n350\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.350\nSo you can see why this is actually\nimplementing something a little bit\n\n351\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.480\nmore secure than just saying,\nhey, it's fine.\n\n352\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.490\nIt's enough for us to do this.\n\n353\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.510\nSo now, I'm going to do copy run.\n\n354\n00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.980\nAgain, saving our information here, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:38.890\nSo that is some of the just basic things\nthat we can do to begin hardening\n\n356\n00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.550\nalong with, of course,\nverifying a couple of other things.\n\n357\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.350\nNow, the great thing is,\nregardless whether we're on a router or\n\n358\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.060\na switch, these commands will work, okay?\n\n359\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.130\nSo it doesn't mean that there's\na different command for\n\n360\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.200\na router or a switch.\n\n361\n00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.220\nThe basic hardening stuff that we're\ndoing really allows us to be able to do\n\n362\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.340\nthis very easily, okay?\n\n363\n00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.290\nSo what are some of the other things that\nwe can do, or that we need to do here?\n\n364\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:05.220\nWe need to essentially control\nthe access to the device itself.\n\n365\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.020\nSo a rule of thumb in terms of hacking,\nright?\n\n366\n00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.330\nOr what you call an idiom in hacking.\n\n367\n00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.440\nIf the hacker can touch your device,\n\n368\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.950\nthe device is no longer yours,\nit's the hackers, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.120\nIn other words, they're saying that\nthey have enough technical know how,\n\n370\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.980\nenough savvy behind their skills,\n\n371\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.230\nthat if they can put their hands on it,\nthey probably can bypass the security.\n\n372\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.500\nSo one of the things that we want to do,\nokay, is to limit the access.\n\n373\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.700\nWell, what are some of\nthe things we can do?\n\n374\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.480\nWell, we can lock doors\nwhere our routers are,\n\n375\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.190\nwhere our switches are, and\nnot allow public access directly to them.\n\n376\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.190\nThe other things, of course,\nthat we can do, in other words,\n\n377\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.020\nnot only physical barriers,\nbut we can even put up,\n\n378\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.020\nagain, configuration barriers\nthat they can access as well.\n\n379\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.690\nSo what we can do is we can also\nlimit the access in a couple of ways.\n\n380\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.440\nSo what we're gonna do is make\nsure that we can set this up and\n\n381\n00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.400\nhave this ready to go, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.370\nSo how do we do this?\n\n383\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.490\nWell, I want to make sure that, let's say,\nfor example, on a switch, and I don't have\n\n384\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.270\na switch right here with me, but we'll\nget into one in another episode here.\n\n385\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:16.730\nBut on a switch, I can limit the access\nto that switch by configuring\n\n386\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:22.610\nan IP address and then establishing\nsecured access to that IP address as well.\n\n387\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.510\nSo when we do an interface VLAN1,\n\n388\n00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.705\nlet me show you what I'm\ntalking about instead here.\n\n389\n00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:30.780\nBut if I were on a switch here, and this\nis not switch, so let me change it just so\n\n390\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.780\nthat we can kinda mimic that it is.\n\n391\n00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.380\nI'm gonna change hostname here for\na moment,\n\n392\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.490\nand we'll just call this\none Switch instead.\n\n393\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.600\nSo if this were a real switch,\n\n394\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.660\nI could instead type in interface vlan 1,\nlike that.\n\n395\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.510\nAnd then, I could type in the IP\naddress that I want to represent for\n\n396\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.590\nthis switch in trying to gain access in.\n\n397\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:58.540\nSo on this one, we'll just do\n192.168.16.20, just as an example.\n\n398\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.845\nAll right, so once we do that,\nremember that on switch,\n\n399\n00:21:04.845 --> 00:21:07.639\neven though all the ports\nare up physically, okay, and\n\n400\n00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:11.190\nwhen you get it right out of the box,\nvirtual ports are not.\n\n401\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.090\nSo you'd have to issue a no\nshutdown at that point.\n\n402\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.960\nAnd then, you'd be ready to go.\n\n403\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.020\nAnd that way, if you wanted to\ncontrol access to this device,\n\n404\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.470\nall you'd have to do is go this IP address\ninstead, and then you would actually be\n\n405\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.300\nthe one to control access to it yourself,\nif you needed to.\n\n406\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.080\nSo that establishes what we\ncall a source address for\n\n407\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.170\nyou to gain access and implement\nsecurity on the device if you want to.\n\n408\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.050\nThe other thing that we would want to do,\n\n409\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.840\nof course, is secure remote\naccess to the devices too, okay?\n\n410\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.110\nSo by doing something like this as well,\nwe would instead implement,\n\n411\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.690\nright, not only the ability to\nconnect to this device, but\n\n412\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:55.130\nto make it a secure connection,\nsuch as using SSH.\n\n413\n00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.470\nNow, you're probably saying,\nwell, go ahead and do that.\n\n414\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.260\nWell, we're gonna do that, but\nwe're gonna do that in another show,\n\n415\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.530\ncuz that's what we have set up for\nwhat we're gonna have in another show.\n\n416\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.620\nBut that's the other\nthing that we would do,\n\n417\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.740\nis that we would not use\nunsecured connections to do so.\n\n418\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.477\nSo no telnet anymore, but just using SSH,\n\n419\n00:22:12.477 --> 00:22:17.812\nmaking sure that if you're doing that that\nyou're going to do that as well, okay?\n\n420\n00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:22.140\nAll right, one last thing here,\nmaybe two things, let me make sure.\n\n421\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.250\nActually, yeah,\na couple of last things here.\n\n422\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.780\nAnd then, we'll do a few things\nas we go on through, okay?\n\n423\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.060\nSo the next thing that we're\ntalking about right now,\n\n424\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.860\nis we also want to configure a banner.\n\n425\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.260\nNow, what the heck is a banner about?\n\n426\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.950\nWell, let me go ahead and get out.\n\n427\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.920\nLet's do a copy, copy run start here,\n\n428\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.010\nwhich is an abbreviation for copy running\ndash config space start up dash config.\n\n429\n00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.142\nSo once I get to this point here,\nand let me change that,\n\n430\n00:22:52.142 --> 00:22:56.620\nwe'll leave it at switch right now, so\nthat's actually kind of funny, okay?\n\n431\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.278\nSo normally, when you get here, okay,\nas you log in either from the console but\n\n432\n00:23:02.278 --> 00:23:06.838\nusually from a Telnet session or\na SSH section coming in, well,\n\n433\n00:23:06.838 --> 00:23:12.520\nyou wanna make sure that people that\nare connecting in are given a message.\n\n434\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.470\nAnd the reason why is that you want to\nensure that there is some legality to\n\n435\n00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:20.350\nthis, that if they make\nan unauthorized connection,\n\n436\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.320\nthat it tells them right away that\nthey were not welcomed to be here.\n\n437\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.500\nSo these particular banner messages\nthat we can create allow someone,\n\n438\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.870\nif they accidentally connect,\nthat it tells them they shouldn't connect.\n\n439\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.460\nWe can even have it actually something\nthat's actually different if we wanted to,\n\n440\n00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.610\nwhich is we can create, also,\n\n441\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.300\na different banner instead of just\na message that pops up for them.\n\n442\n00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.820\nWe can create a different\ntype of banner where,\n\n443\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.630\nif Zach logs in, it gives a message like,\nyou need to configure this.\n\n444\n00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.706\nSo that way, he actually has a message\nfrom whoever actually is administrating it\n\n445\n00:23:50.706 --> 00:23:51.695\nif he wanted to, as well.\n\n446\n00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:54.810\nBut there's a couple of different types\nof banners that we can create, and\n\n447\n00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.550\nthat's what we need to do, okay?\n\n448\n00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.537\nSo I'm gonna log in as myself now.\n\n449\n00:24:05.018 --> 00:24:05.981\nAnd then gain access.\n\n450\n00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:07.331\nAnd let me go back to the router here.\n\n451\n00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.800\nOops, I gotta get into\nglobal configuration mode.\n\n452\n00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.107\nI always forget that.\n\n453\n00:24:13.107 --> 00:24:15.875\nhostname R1.\n\n454\n00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:18.979\nLet's just do something like\nthat just very easily, okay?\n\n455\n00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:23.007\nAll right, so when we talk about\ncreating this type of banner,\n\n456\n00:24:23.007 --> 00:24:27.910\nwe're specifically caught out on\nthe exam to create a login banner.\n\n457\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:34.026\nNow a login banner normally shows up\nright before the authentication prompt.\n\n458\n00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:36.743\nFor you and me, that is right here, okay?\n\n459\n00:24:36.743 --> 00:24:39.400\nSo right before that\nauthentication prompt.\n\n460\n00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.350\nThere's another banner that we can\n\n461\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:49.720\nimplement called an MOTD,\nor a Message of the Day.\n\n462\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.710\nWhich shows to everybody, okay?\n\n463\n00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.260\nRegardless of whether or\nnot they're at a login or not.\n\n464\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.630\nWhen it comes up as a connect in it says,\nhere is a message that you should read.\n\n465\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.670\nEssentially both of those at this point,\nright?\n\n466\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.100\nUsually on the log-in banners,\nit may be informational, instructional for\n\n467\n00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.110\nsomeone like Zach that I'm working with.\n\n468\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.934\nOr in Mesh, it'd be just a warning, okay?\n\n469\n00:25:10.934 --> 00:25:13.121\nSo either one can actually be that way.\n\n470\n00:25:13.121 --> 00:25:17.932\nSo we are going to configure this to help\nus out on just creating just creating\n\n471\n00:25:17.932 --> 00:25:19.680\njust a login banner first.\n\n472\n00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.717\nSo when we do something like this, let's\nget into our global configuration mode,\n\n473\n00:25:23.717 --> 00:25:24.417\nwhich I am in.\n\n474\n00:25:24.417 --> 00:25:26.740\nThen it's fairly simple,\nI type in the word banner.\n\n475\n00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.210\nAnd now I did a question mark so\nthat you can see a couple of things, okay?\n\n476\n00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.740\nThe one that we're gonna do is right here,\nset login banner.\n\n477\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.680\nNotice that there's a few of them.\n\n478\n00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.798\nThe Message of the Day, this is the one\nthat will displayed to everyone regardless\n\n479\n00:25:40.798 --> 00:25:44.400\nof whether or not there's a login\nthat's presented them, to or not.\n\n480\n00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.490\nSo you'll see if you can\nfigure both of them,\n\n481\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.120\nthe Message of the Day will\nproceed the log inbound.\n\n482\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.944\nThere's also the ability to do what we\ncall an exact process banner as well,\n\n483\n00:25:55.944 --> 00:25:56.495\nokay.\n\n484\n00:25:56.495 --> 00:25:59.240\nAnd this also is another one that\nis out there and available to you.\n\n485\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.120\nDisplayed right before the user\nsees the exec privilege mode.\n\n486\n00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.250\nSo when you actually\nfinally do authenticate,\n\n487\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.400\nyou actually get another banner if you\nactually wanna configure all of that.\n\n488\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.620\nAnd then there's even an incoming banner\nthat says, incoming terminal line banner.\n\n489\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.000\nNow if you choose something like this,\n\n490\n00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.550\nthis is gonna be if you enable something\nlike what's called reverse telnet.\n\n491\n00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.150\nWe're not getting into that, so we're not\ngonna worry about it for right now, okay.\n\n492\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.480\nBut for us, usually it's the two,\nit's the MOTD and the login banner.\n\n493\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.090\nSo we'll just see.\n\n494\n00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.413\nI actually have us doing both.\n\n495\n00:26:32.413 --> 00:26:33.629\nSo we'll go and configure both.\n\n496\n00:26:33.629 --> 00:26:36.035\nBut let's do one at a time here.\n\n497\n00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:39.589\nAll right, so let's say that we wanna set\na message for people that try to log in.\n\n498\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.190\nSo the way that we do that is once we\nget here, we start typing in banner, and\n\n499\n00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.600\nthen login.\n\n500\n00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.820\nAnd now I'm gonna hit the question mark so\nthat you can see something, okay?\n\n501\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.570\nNow, notice that after banner login,\nit says LINE, all in capital letters here.\n\n502\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.570\nAnd this is where it gets tricky if\nyou haven't done this before, okay?\n\n503\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.798\nBanner text and notice the way that\nthey're trying to show an example.\n\n504\n00:27:02.798 --> 00:27:08.200\nIf they used the letter C,\nthen you type that in right here, okay?\n\n505\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.508\nRight where I had the question mark.\n\n506\n00:27:10.508 --> 00:27:14.578\nThen you type in whatever you want to and\nat the end of the message,\n\n507\n00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:16.990\nyou type in the letter C again.\n\n508\n00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.190\nThe problem with the letter C is simple.\n\n509\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.050\nYou might use the letter\nC inside of your message.\n\n510\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.530\nWhich means if you do that,\nif you use a C, somewhere along the line,\n\n511\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.970\nit's gonna say you ended the message,\nokay?\n\n512\n00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:29.850\nSo don't do that.\n\n513\n00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.770\nUsually, the one that I like to\nuse is Shift, no, not Shift.\n\n514\n00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.050\nYeah, yeah, Shift and the number 6.\n\n515\n00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.980\nI keep looking down like,\nthat's not right, no, but it is.\n\n516\n00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.750\nShift and number 6,\nwhich is the little caret mark.\n\n517\n00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.610\nThat's the one that I like to use,\nwhen I do something like this cuz\n\n518\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.400\nI don't know when I would ever use that\ninside of a message, but you can, okay.\n\n519\n00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.210\nSo let's show you the idea.\n\n520\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.210\nSo banner login.\n\n521\n00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:01.640\nAnd now I'm going to do the Shift and\nthe caret symbol.\n\n522\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.590\nI'm gonna press Enter and now look.\n\n523\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.220\nNow enter the text message that we want.\n\n524\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.335\nSo it's right here I want to actually\n\n525\n00:28:11.335 --> 00:28:15.297\nsay authorized users only.\n\n526\n00:28:15.297 --> 00:28:20.970\nAll right, so if I am done with that,\nand I say it's the end of the message,\n\n527\n00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.470\nI can do a Shift and\nthe number 6 again, and press Enter.\n\n528\n00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.820\nAnd you're saying that's it,\nis that all that there is?\n\n529\n00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.070\nYep, sure.\n\n530\n00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.120\nLet's get back out here,\nand let's exit of this.\n\n531\n00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.340\nSo I'm all the way back out to the user\nmode, and now notice, look at that.\n\n532\n00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.190\nThere's the banner.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n533\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.740\n&gt;&gt; It's actually right there, so\n\n534\n00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.470\nevery time it brings this up,\nthat's what puts in place here.\n\n535\n00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.070\nSo you might be wondering like, why are\nyou actually stating something like this?\n\n536\n00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.970\nBecause what's happened in the past Zach,\nat some point, right?\n\n537\n00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.160\nIs that people have actually seen these\nmessages, like the Message of the Day.\n\n538\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.785\nNormally it says,\nwelcome to the ITProTV network.\n\n539\n00:28:58.785 --> 00:29:00.670\nSo once you actually issue\nthat kind of welcome,\n\n540\n00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.160\nit's like you putting a welcome mat out.\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n541\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.790\n&gt;&gt; And hackers go,\n\n542\n00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.360\nwell you welcomed me to\ncome into this network.\n\n543\n00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.110\nSo he didn't say, how I could come in.\n\n544\n00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.048\nBut that's what you don't want to do.\n\n545\n00:29:12.048 --> 00:29:16.210\nSo you wanna make sure that these messages\nare usually very direct and to the point,\n\n546\n00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.805\nthat if you're not supposed to be here,\nyou're not supposed to be here.\n\n547\n00:29:19.805 --> 00:29:24.270\nSo it's not something that you'll\nactually end up seeing but\n\n548\n00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.820\npeople will actually look at you and go,\ndid you have all the warnings in place?\n\n549\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.540\nYes we had all the warnings in place,\nright.\n\n550\n00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.198\nAnd now let me get back in here.\n\n551\n00:29:32.198 --> 00:29:33.742\nAnd let's do another one here.\n\n552\n00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:42.920\nAnd so let's do the Message\nof the Day banner, MOTD.\n\n553\n00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.900\nAnd once again I'm going to do\nthe Shift and the number 6 here,\n\n554\n00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.970\ncuz I know I'm not gonna use that\ninside of that message here.\n\n555\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.425\nSo now what I want to do is I want to\nactually put in something a little bit\n\n556\n00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:55.136\nmore direct.\n\n557\n00:29:55.136 --> 00:30:03.490\nUnauthorized access is strictly-\n&gt;&gt; Prohibited.\n\n558\n00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.873\n&gt;&gt; Yep, prohibited.\n\n559\n00:30:05.873 --> 00:30:09.370\nIf I could spell prohibit, pro-hib-it.\n\n560\n00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.020\nYeah.\n\n561\n00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.986\nAnd then a Shift and the number 6 here,\n\n562\n00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:17.587\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, into the caret.\n\n563\n00:30:17.587 --> 00:30:19.435\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n564\n00:30:19.435 --> 00:30:21.570\nget back out here.\n\n565\n00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.830\nAnd now as we see this, you can see now,\n\n566\n00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.420\nnotice that right above the login banner,\n\n567\n00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.800\nthere's the Message of the Day as well,\nunauthorized access zone.\n\n568\n00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.440\nNow, believe it or not, once you actually\ncreate this right, you can actually create\n\n569\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.940\nit where it's fancy and\nhave a border around and everything else.\n\n570\n00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.620\nThere are people that create these\nmagnificent-looking ones that are amazing.\n\n571\n00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.940\nThey really are.\n\n572\n00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.830\nBut this banner though, you can even have\nit where it actually has little numbers\n\n573\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:55.440\nlike I could actually make a banner and\nmessage that says Zach, press 1.\n\n574\n00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.270\nAnd it will actually bring him\nto his login just for him,\n\n575\n00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.840\nand then he'll gain access\nto whatever level I want to.\n\n576\n00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.600\nAnd I can have something for like two\nto exit out of this, to do all of that.\n\n577\n00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.130\nSo I can create a whole menu if I\n\n578\n00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.110\nwanted to.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n579\n00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.500\n&gt;&gt; Using this banner message if I chose\n\n580\n00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.730\nto do something like this.\n\n581\n00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.430\nSo it is very possible that we\ncan actually create that, and\n\n582\n00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.080\nget that all done as well, okay?\n\n583\n00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.120\nAll right, Zach, there's still a few\nmore things for us to configure,\n\n584\n00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.590\nbut we're a little bit more than\nhalfway through, not too much more.\n\n585\n00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.820\nSo this looks like a good place for\nus to stop and\n\n586\n00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.280\nthen continue on into part two\non basic device hardening.\n\n587\n00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.420\nImplementing initial device hardening\npart two is coming your way.\n\n588\n00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.810\nYou can't stop it.\n\n589\n00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.680\nIt's gonna happen.\n\n590\n00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.480\nMake sure you see parts one and two.\n\n591\n00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.680\nAnd Ronnie, before we move on,\n\n592\n00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.550\nanything else you'd like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well, these are fairly simple,\n\n593\n00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:44.810\nright, but at the same time, they're very\nimportant, and do not overlook them.\n\n594\n00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.922\nThe banner,\nI'd make sure that I pay attention to.\n\n595\n00:31:47.922 --> 00:31:51.305\nBut all of the other things that we've\nalready done this before inside of\n\n596\n00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:52.290\nour series.\n\n597\n00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.710\nSo it's a simple review at this point.\n\n598\n00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.471\nBut it's something that you\nshould be able to review and go,\n\n599\n00:31:57.471 --> 00:32:00.628\nthis will not cause me any issues\nwhen I am getting ready for the exam.\n\n600\n00:32:00.628 --> 00:32:02.995\nThe only new concept\nthat we've put in here so\n\n601\n00:32:02.995 --> 00:32:05.700\nfar is really the banner message itself.\n\n602\n00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.840\nSo make sure you focus in on that\nparticular part of what we're actually\n\n603\n00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.660\ndoing and practice that a couple of\ntimes before you go into the exam.\n\n604\n00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Great advice.\n\n605\n00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.760\nCisco CCENT's also a great series.\n\n606\n00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.880\nSo make sure you

00:00:11.839\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.957\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:16.385\nempowering the world\nwith engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:20.984\nI'm your host Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Cisco's CCENT Implement\n\n7\n00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:23.252\ninitial device hardening part two.\n\n8\n00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:24.737\nI knew you wanted to see that.\n\n9\n00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:26.263\nWe both did in fact.\n\n10\n00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:28.940\nAnd what I mean by both,\nis myself and Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.459\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.085\n&gt;&gt; I'd love to see that too.\n\n13\n00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.312\nI'm glad that we're here\nto do that together Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:33.872\nAll right,\n\n15\n00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:37.402\nthank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue on our CCENT journey.\n\n16\n00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:41.073\nWe are in a part two on taking a look at,\nof course, initial device hardening.\n\n17\n00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.201\nAnd we're moving on.\n\n18\n00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:46.893\nWe are now taking a look at some of the\nother types of device configurations that\n\n19\n00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:49.523\nwe should consider as\nwe are now going to be,\n\n20\n00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:53.523\nwell, working with switches and\nrouters directly a lot of times.\n\n21\n00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:56.047\nAt the CCENT level, there is going to be,\n\n22\n00:00:56.047 --> 00:01:00.824\nwhen you actually work as a professional,\nyou may be switching out hardware.\n\n23\n00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:02.438\nThat's probably the big one right?\n\n24\n00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:06.478\nAs routers get older and all of a sudden\nyou get a shipment of either replaced\n\n25\n00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:11.033\nrouters, which is probably the issue, is\nthat you'll get routers that come in that\n\n26\n00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.005\nneed to be reconfigured but\nneed to be secured as well.\n\n27\n00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.058\nSo some of the tips that we just showed\nyou are really gonna be helpful.\n\n28\n00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:20.446\nAnd you'll have to follow what ever the\nprotocol is that your company says needs\n\n29\n00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.633\nto be on all those devices but\nthat's how you do it.\n\n30\n00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:25.161\nThat's what essentially we're\ntalking about right now.\n\n31\n00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.565\nSo the next thing that we want to do,\nokay, is that we want to continue on by\n\n32\n00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:34.472\nalso talking about something normally is\nenabled in the lab setting very often but\n\n33\n00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:37.130\nnot so much on real hardware and\nequipment.\n\n34\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.806\nAlthough let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine here.\n\n35\n00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:40.497\nOkay?\nSo,\n\n36\n00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:44.020\nI decided to bring up our\nown router this time.\n\n37\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.494\nThe reason why is that there\nis no official lab for\n\n38\n00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:53.407\nthis particular domain\nobjective inside of inside of\n\n39\n00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:58.334\nthe practice labs,\nthere's no official lab for it.\n\n40\n00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:03.987\nSo I'm essentially building my own lab\nhere at this point as we are doing this.\n\n41\n00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:08.998\nSo one of the things that we wanna do\nis enable logging synchronous here.\n\n42\n00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:11.012\nOkay, I know that doesn't sound-\n&gt;&gt; Logging synchronous.\n\n43\n00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:12.283\n&gt;&gt; Yes, logging synchronous here.\n\n44\n00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:14.670\nWe want to enable logging synchronous.\n\n45\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.093\nActually, technically,\nsynchronous logging is what it's called.\n\n46\n00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:20.680\nNow, the reason why I said logging\nsynchronous is because the command that\n\n47\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.765\nyou actually type in to do so.\n\n48\n00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:24.542\n&gt;&gt; But let me show you what\nI'm talking about here, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:28.298\nSo Ronnie and then Cisco.\n\n50\n00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:30.346\nAnd had to do this again.\n\n51\n00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:33.334\nLet see I'm gonna get tired at typing\nin passwords but it will work.\n\n52\n00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:37.401\nNow, I need to get the screen\nflowing with information.\n\n53\n00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:37.974\nOkay, so\n\n54\n00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:42.277\nsome of the things that I can do is I\ncan actually issue a debug command and\n\n55\n00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:46.970\nthe whole goal behind this is to actually\njust get some information flowing.\n\n56\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.203\nNow what I want to do,\n\n57\n00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:52.331\nI'm trying to make sure I find one\nthat's not gonna lock the router up.\n\n58\n00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:55.870\nYou can have so\nmuch data that comes across the screen and\n\n59\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.590\nthe console that it can\nlock the router up.\n\n60\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.376\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n&gt;&gt; So you see that there's so\n\n61\n00:03:00.376 --> 00:03:01.755\nmany different things.\n\n62\n00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:05.500\nAnd the very first command\nthat there is is debug all,\n\n63\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.570\nwhich means send all of\nthis different information.\n\n64\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.346\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n65\n00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:14.136\n&gt;&gt; From A all the way through V\nis what we actually saw, right?\n\n66\n00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:16.690\nSo when you see that word, second one.\n\n67\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.210\nWhen you see, I'm gonna do actually all.\n\n68\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.170\nThis is alphabetical order.\n\n69\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.630\nSo it actually sends\neverything beginning with AAA.\n\n70\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.690\nAll the way down through all this stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.130\nWhatever's enabled, whatever's on, right?\n\n72\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.254\nIt will start sending information\nacross the screen, but\n\n73\n00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.294\nI don't want to do that\nI want to do IP here.\n\n74\n00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:41.935\nAnd from this point here I think that's,\nI don't know if that’s all I can, IP.\n\n75\n00:03:44.784 --> 00:03:47.975\nThat should be enough.\n\n76\n00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:50.210\nYeah, I'm just trying to see if\nthere's anything else there.\n\n77\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.275\nLet's do IP packets.\n\n78\n00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:52.421\nThat'll work.\n\n79\n00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.673\nThere's nothing, packet, all right.\n\n80\n00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.990\nSo if there was actually\ninformation on here and\n\n81\n00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.750\nthings started coming across here.\n\n82\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.271\nWell, let's see, maybe, of course,\nthere's nothing coming across.\n\n83\n00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:04.918\nWhy wouldn't it?\n\n84\n00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:06.640\nIt's cuz I'm not connected\nto any other device.\n\n85\n00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.450\nI just thought about that.\n\n86\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.730\nThat's probably not a great.\n\n87\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.680\nAn example, so let me do an un all and\nthen debug all.\n\n88\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.940\nWe'll just do a debug all very quickly.\n\n89\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.890\nNow, so notice this may\nimpact network performance.\n\n90\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.610\nNever say yes to this, but\n\n91\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.750\nnotice how all the screen is\nactually popping up there, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.003\nNow, what I want to show you,\n\n93\n00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.875\ncuz I'm going to turn this off very\nquickly in a second here, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:36.889\nIf I try and type in a command like this,\ncan you see it?\n\n95\n00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:37.757\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n96\n00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:43.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so what you have to\nbe able to do, write this on all and\n\n97\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.923\nthat's where it actually and\nall of a sudden,\n\n98\n00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:50.159\nwe are in trouble because turn all\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n99\n00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.297\nthis is actually really a problem at this\npoint, is what we're actually seeing.\n\n100\n00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:58.614\nSo you're seeing where it is now\nalmost impossible to do this.\n\n101\n00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:04.176\nAnd that's what's happened, right,\n\n102\n00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:08.321\nis that this router is now actually\nsending all this information and I cannot\n\n103\n00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:12.228\neven stop enough to be able to see What\nis going on and what is happening.\n\n104\n00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.122\n&gt;&gt; There's no way to\nforce stop that Ronnie?\n\n105\n00:05:14.122 --> 00:05:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right now I can try.\n\n106\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.602\nWe can try and do the Shift+Ctrl+6.\n\n107\n00:05:20.602 --> 00:05:22.612\nOkay, we can try and do a Ctrl+C.\n\n108\n00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:24.143\nNothing is happening, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:29.732\nSo that's why you don't ever want\nto do this idea of debug all.\n\n110\n00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:35.880\n&gt;&gt; So usually at this point you do undebug\nall and see if you can get in there.\n\n111\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.010\nBut notice I'm not able to get in there.\n\n112\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.760\nSo now, what I have to do\nis I need to go ahead and\n\n113\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.450\nstop this router somehow if not,\nit's just gonna continue on okay?\n\n114\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.690\nSo the problem that I have is,\neven if I actually do that right?\n\n115\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.350\nAnd this command is actually\nrunning in the background.\n\n116\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.250\nIf I had saved it I'm in trouble\ncuz it's gonna stay up and\n\n117\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.250\nit's gonna continue to do this.\n\n118\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.220\nSo that is what we're actually gonna do\nright now, is we're gonna reboot this\n\n119\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.310\nrouter to try and help us to make sure\nthat we can recover from this right now.\n\n120\n00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.910\nAll right, so I had to actually go back\nin and literally turn that router off.\n\n121\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.830\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And reboot it and\n\n122\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.640\nmake sure that everything is back up.\n\n123\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.060\nSo here we go, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.005\nSo as we come back, there it is,\nit's asking for a username, Ronnie, and\n\n125\n00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:20.742\nthen Cisco as a password.\n\n126\n00:06:20.742 --> 00:06:24.350\nAnd now for me to gain access in.\n\n127\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.667\nAnd we can see it, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:30.581\nSo if I now go ahead and issue an undebug\nall, now after I debug like that,\n\n129\n00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:33.250\njust in case it starts coming through.\n\n130\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.290\nIt would have come through immediately.\n\n131\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.190\nI would have been overwhelmed,\nalready, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.680\nSo what I want to do is I wanna make sure\n\n133\n00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.690\nthat I do not have that happen again,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.480\nSo I want to make sure that I always\nhave access to this right here.\n\n135\n00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.920\nAnd the way that we do that is\na couple of things here, okay?\n\n136\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.624\nFirst thing I need to do is I need to go\ninto well where I can configure that.\n\n137\n00:06:52.624 --> 00:06:55.397\nSo inside of the global\nconfiguration here, okay,\n\n138\n00:06:55.397 --> 00:06:59.190\nwhat I'm seeing is what's\ngetting displayed on the screen.\n\n139\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.489\nSo I want to go to line console zero,\n\n140\n00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:08.208\noops, line con 0 here.\n\n141\n00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:12.663\nThen it's right here,\nI can do logging sync, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:14.740\nSo finally-\n&gt;&gt; There's the logging synchronous.\n\n143\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is.\n\n144\n00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.040\nSo we can do that.\n\n145\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.370\nAnd we don't actually have to\nenter in this limit size or\n\n146\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.860\nanything else like that.\n\n147\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.400\nSo now what that should do, and\n\n148\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.080\nI'm not gonna turn it on again just in\ncase I can't get back access to it.\n\n149\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.100\nBut this is what allows, now,\nas messages start scrolling across,\n\n150\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.780\nnotice what happened immediately\nafter I got that first message here.\n\n151\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.939\nIt still went ahead and\nput that underneath the message.\n\n152\n00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:43.420\nSo now as I continue to do stuff here,\nall right, and I scroll back down.\n\n153\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.250\nNotice how that line is always there and\navailable.\n\n154\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.250\nSo just as soon as another message\ncame in, it went ahead, and\n\n155\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.450\nit repainted this line for us,\nokay, is what we ended up seeing.\n\n156\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.100\nSo logging synchronous helps\nus to do something like that.\n\n157\n00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.660\nBut do remember that it has\nbeen enabled on the console.\n\n158\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.120\nYou can also do this on\nthe VT wire lines as well but\n\n159\n00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.960\nnormally this is where it's also done too,\nokay?\n\n160\n00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.130\nNow if you wanna see this messages popup\nlike they're doing like right here okay,\n\n161\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.260\nall the time.\n\n162\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.720\nAs you do this, you can also let me make,\nis it right here?\n\n163\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.940\nLet me tell you ,okay it is.\n\n164\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.700\nThere is also what is called a terminal.\n\n165\n00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.720\nMonitor command, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.450\nAnd this is where you'll see\nthat it's usually on by default.\n\n167\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.050\nConsoles are ready monitors, and that\nmeans everything that's gonna get sent\n\n168\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.610\nout as a message is also gonna\ndisplay in the console port as well.\n\n169\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.023\nSo using the combination of those\ntwo is what we're doing here, right?\n\n170\n00:08:37.023 --> 00:08:39.433\nSo that's a part of the management and\n\n171\n00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:43.738\npart of what we're talking about\ntrying to do as we go through this.\n\n172\n00:08:43.738 --> 00:08:48.527\nNow, the other thing that can happen\nafter awhile on these console ports,\n\n173\n00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:52.190\nand you saw that a couple of times,\nat times there.\n\n174\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.030\nIf I leave it alone long enough,\nokay, it is going to time out,\n\n175\n00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.560\nis what's gonna happen.\n\n176\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.507\nBut we're not gonna leave it\nhere long enough to do so.\n\n177\n00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:10.010\nLet's do a show running-config here for\na moment.\n\n178\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.920\nSo, normally,\nthat is a security measure, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.250\nIs that what we want to do, is that we\ndon't want somebody to just console in and\n\n180\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.540\nI just stay connected all\nthe time on this particular port.\n\n181\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.430\nSo we can also set a time\nlimit on this port\n\n182\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.870\nto tell it when it's actually\ngonna log out if we need it to.\n\n183\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.970\nSo we can say 15 minutes if we want to.\n\n184\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.570\nWe can say 30 minutes.\n\n185\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.450\nAnd that way if someone hasn't\ntouched a switch in 30 minutes,\n\n186\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.790\nit automatically kicks them back out,\nasking them for a user name and\n\n187\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.380\npassword, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.790\nSo let see what this one is\nactually set up by default here.\n\n189\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:51.145\nIf I go back into\nthe global configuration,\n\n190\n00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:55.495\nline consoles 0 and then timeout.\n\n191\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:04.482\nUsually it's timeout,\nsorry, it's exec timeout.\n\n192\n00:10:04.482 --> 00:10:09.900\nExec-Timeout and now it's gonna say\nwhat are the minutes I can time out in.\n\n193\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.760\nIf you set it to 0, that means\nessentially disable the timeout, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.310\nSo if that's you need to do, and\n\n195\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.340\nin most lab settings that's\nwhat it's set to is timeout 0.\n\n196\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.760\nSo that way you don't always have to enter\nin your username again, not username,\n\n197\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.380\nyeah you don't actually have to get\nkicked out and enter your username and\n\n198\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.990\nyour password back in there.\n\n199\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.120\nSo if you set it that way\nthat's what it will do.\n\n200\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.590\nIn a production network you may see\nit's limited to, let's say 15 minutes or\n\n201\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.080\n5 minutes,\n10 minutes somewhere around there.\n\n202\n00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.693\nBut you can choose anything\nbetween there and 35,791 minutes.\n\n203\n00:10:42.693 --> 00:10:44.285\nI don't know how long, but I should.\n\n204\n00:10:44.285 --> 00:10:45.910\nBut that's a long time.\n\n205\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.754\nAs you go through there\nto be able to do so.\n\n206\n00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:50.947\nSo you have that choice to do that,\nas well.\n\n207\n00:10:50.947 --> 00:10:51.830\nAll right?\n\n208\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.380\nSo those are also helpful things\nthat we do as we start taking a look\n\n209\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.630\nat the idea of managing our devices,\nas well.\n\n210\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.900\nOkay?\n\n211\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.416\nLet's see,\nanother one here is setting the host name.\n\n212\n00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:05.016\nThis is one of the most\nimportant elements.\n\n213\n00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:07.032\nI know people don't think about it, but\n\n214\n00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:11.062\nremember that this affects things like CDP\nand LLDP to be able to report the name of\n\n215\n00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:14.410\nthe devices using those layer\ntwo discovery protocols.\n\n216\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.750\nIt's going to be important.\n\n217\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.020\nIt's also important that we don't leave it\nat default things like switch and router.\n\n218\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.390\nBecause when we create things like our\nSSH certificate, our crypto certificate,\n\n219\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.190\nso that people can connect securely,\nit is also a combination.\n\n220\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.850\nWhere it uses, essentially,\nthe username and\n\n221\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.530\nthe domain name to generate part\nof that encryption as well.\n\n222\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.540\nSo that's why you always\nwant to configure,\n\n223\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.670\non every device as you come to it\nthe actual host name that you want.\n\n224\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:47.210\nSo I'm gonna go back to Router 1 for\nright now and do that.\n\n225\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:52.050\nSo once I get Router 1 on there, okay,\nat that point, well, now we can talk\n\n226\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.214\nabout this idea of actually creating\nsomething like the crytocertificate too.\n\n227\n00:11:57.214 --> 00:12:05.110\nNow, before I do that I need\nto implement a domain name,\n\n228\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:11.496\nip domain-name, and I can do, itpro.tv.\n\n229\n00:12:11.496 --> 00:12:16.406\nLike that.\nNow if I do a crypto key\n\n230\n00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:20.850\ngenerate, oops.\n\n231\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.320\nI forgot the length of the key.\n\n232\n00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.046\nWe'll just do 1024 RSA.\n\n233\n00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.550\nYeah, I forgot a lot of stuff.\n\n234\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.610\nCrypto key generate RSA,\nnow it's asking me for the modulus key.\n\n235\n00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:38.400\nNotice how it took the name, and\nit actually took the host name and\n\n236\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.740\nthe domain name and\nmade it part of the key, is what it did.\n\n237\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.974\nSo at this point It will now\ngenerate that key and so\n\n238\n00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:50.517\nthe lapse time was about one second here,\nand it now also enabled it for\n\n239\n00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:53.675\nsecured connection if we choose to do so,\nokay?\n\n240\n00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:57.015\nRemember that SSH 1.99?\n\n241\n00:12:57.015 --> 00:13:00.029\nIt is not the same as SSH 2.0.\n\n242\n00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.512\n2.0 is the one that you want to use.\n\n243\n00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:05.150\n1.99 means that it would do version 1 and\n2.\n\n244\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.290\nVersion 1 is already corrupted,\nso it's not good.\n\n245\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.080\nSo if you want to actually\nenable version 2,\n\n246\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.570\nthat's what you do is\nyou do IPSSH version 2.\n\n247\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.760\nAnd that will ensure at some\npoint we'll get a message\n\n248\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.915\nprobably in a little bit of time here that\nit will go ahead and enable version 2.\n\n249\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.420\nSo that's a part of all of some of the,\nyou know the different things that you\n\n250\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.980\nwant to consider when you\nstart to do those too.\n\n251\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.023\nThe last thing that I really call out is\nthat as you start to harden the device,\n\n252\n00:13:39.023 --> 00:13:43.293\nverify that you're running\nthe right protocols on your router,\n\n253\n00:13:43.293 --> 00:13:46.342\nespecially, okay, as you start doing this.\n\n254\n00:13:46.342 --> 00:13:49.259\nSo if I want to do that\nI do show IP protocols.\n\n255\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.910\nAnd now you can see that here\nis the routing protocol.\n\n256\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.310\nThere 's nothing running and\nthat's fine at the beginning,\n\n257\n00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.790\nbut you want to make sure you're\nrunning the right ones here.\n\n258\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.390\nOkay?\n\n259\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.670\nSo I mentioned early on in the show\nwhen I showed this I was like,\n\n260\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.330\nI don't remember what NFS stands for.\n\n261\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:13.330\nBut IP routing for\nNFS means Non-Stop Forwarding aware.\n\n262\n00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.200\nNFS non-stop forwarding ware.\n\n263\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.950\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n264\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.630\nThat means that even as\nthe device is being rebooted.\n\n265\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.140\nI know this is the strangest\nthing in the world.\n\n266\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.640\nIt will still, whatever it\nactually has a configuration on,\n\n267\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.760\nit will still continue to\nforward routing traffic, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.290\nEven if the device is rebooted.\n\n269\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.780\nIt's pretty darn good.\n\n270\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.630\nSo you won't normally\nhold up a lot of traffic\n\n271\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.350\neven if you reboot the router itself.\n\n272\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.610\nNow if you have a lot of extra\nconfiguration though, if you have a lot of\n\n273\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.730\nother things going on, it's going to\ntake a moment for all that to catch up.\n\n274\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.320\nBut this will continue to forward\ntraffic that is all ready existing going\n\n275\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.260\nthrough the device to be able to do so.\n\n276\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.890\nSo it is aware that it can actually\nhandle something like that as you go\n\n277\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.835\nthrough, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:03.366\nSo that is another key, too, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:08.232\nOne last thing that they also have in the\ninitial configuration here is to make sure\n\n280\n00:15:08.232 --> 00:15:12.112\nthat you understand the basic\nconfiguration of a dynamic routing\n\n281\n00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:13.290\nprotocol.\n\n282\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.880\nWhich is gonna be router and\nthen rip, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.330\nOnce you do that, then you put in\nyour network statement that you want.\n\n284\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.150\nAnd from that point,\nit will start routing.\n\n285\n00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.720\nDo show IP protocol.\n\n286\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.610\nAnd notice that the big difference\nthere it went from just doing\n\n287\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.560\nthe you know the NFS here, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.430\nThe non stop forwarding, I can't remember\nthat and now notice that rip is enable and\n\n289\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.790\nit's enabled right now for\nthis one network very easy to attach but\n\n290\n00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.430\nyou do want to verify that\nit is all working as well.\n\n291\n00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.790\nZach, at least from this\npoint that is the best device\n\n292\n00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.780\nhardening that we are talking about.\n\n293\n00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.420\nIs there a lot more?\n\n294\n00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.971\nYes, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:03.868\nFor us those will cover the exam\nobjectives that we need.\n\n296\n00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:05.663\nThis is really basically reviewed.\n\n297\n00:16:05.663 --> 00:16:07.720\nI know, it takes me a long time to review.\n\n298\n00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.247\nBut overall though,\nthat's what Joash ended up seeing.\n\n299\n00:16:10.247 --> 00:16:13.680\nSo make sure you take some time and\ngo over this stuff again.\n\n300\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Implemented initial\ndevice hardening part 2.\n\n301\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.350\nMake sure you see part one.\n\n302\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.880\nRonnie is doing a great job.\n\n303\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.460\nNo stone unturned.\n\n304\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.430\nHe takes care of you.\n\n305\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.350\nAnd Ronnie anything else you\nlike to say before we move on?\n\n306\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, not this point, right.\n\n307\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.540\nThe concepts that we're going over.\n\n308\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.840\nThere were just a couple of new concepts,\nso make sure you\n\n309\n00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.620\nfocus in on those new concepts such\nas the logging synchronise and\n\n310\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.380\nthe idea here of actually verification\nof those routing protocols,\n\n311\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.180\nmaking sure that they're up and\ngoing, as well as the banners, okay?.\n\n312\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.740\nThose are kind of the ones\nthat you want to focus in on\n\n313\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.840\nas you start to add in more material.\n\n314\n00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.190\nThe rest of this is stuff that we have\ncovered during this entire series.\n\n315\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.647\nSo just use that as a review\nto help you out, too.\n\n316\n00:16:53.647 --> 00:16:56.660\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, and a great series.\n\n317\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.302\nCisco CCENT,\nmake sure you see every episode.\n\n318\n00:16:59.302 --> 00:17:00.968\nYou'll be glad you did, it'll help you.\n\n319\n00:17:00.968 --> 00:17:04.415\nAnd while you're there, in the Course\nLibrary, take a look at the other\n\n320\n00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:07.540\nthousands of videos we have that\nare there to help you go further.\n\n321\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.387\nCheck it out.\n\n322\n00:17:08.387 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:07.990\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.814\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:16.000\n&gt;&gt; Hi, thank you for watching IT Pro TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.780\nI'm your host Zack Memis as we\ncontinue on with CISCO CCENT.\n\n7\n00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.920\nPerform Device Management is\nthe title of this episode, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620\nI think you should stick around and\nwatch it.\n\n9\n00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.650\nAnd Ronnie Wong is gonna show\nyou what he means by this.\n\n10\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.070\nHey, Ronnie, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me back on the show, Zack,\n\n12\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.790\nas we continue on in taking a look\nof more of Cisco's CCENT together.\n\n13\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.780\nWe are now taking a look, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.720\nat different device management techniques,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.746\nWe've already done a little bit\nhere on the device hardening and\n\n16\n00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:44.717\nit is part of management at the same time.\n\n17\n00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n18\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.357\n&gt;&gt; But now we're really talking about\nsome of the other things that we may not\n\n19\n00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:48.917\ncare about.\n\n20\n00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:52.651\nSo I would say it's more of a catch\nall topic that we're covering here.\n\n21\n00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n22\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.751\n&gt;&gt; Because yeah, it's one of those things\nwhere you have to know a few other things.\n\n23\n00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:04.039\nSo we're not only including in of course\nbacking up things like the iOS itself and\n\n24\n00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.216\nrecovering from loss of the iOS,\n\n25\n00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:10.610\nbut we also need to understand how\nto do password recovery as well.\n\n26\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.690\nSo we'll talk about that when we get to\nit, but those are really the main topics\n\n27\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.600\nthat we need to make sure that\nwe understand how to do this.\n\n28\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.310\nAnd of course,\n\n29\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.640\nit begins with us understanding a little\nbit more about the router itself, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.280\nSo I brought up our practice\nlabs environment and\n\n31\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.400\ninside of our practice labs environment,\nit would be the device maintenance\n\n32\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.830\nprocedures that you're\nall be going through.\n\n33\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.931\nAnd part of that is here but the other\npart on password recovery is not.\n\n34\n00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.528\nSo we'll be using be real\nequipment to talk about and\n\n35\n00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:45.378\nto show you as much as we can what\nyou can end up doing as well.\n\n36\n00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:49.390\nSo we're gonna begin by taking a look at\nthe idea of file system management first.\n\n37\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.540\nSo let me zoom in.\n\n38\n00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.114\nWe're gonna use NYEDGE1 for\nright now to help us out.\n\n39\n00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.670\nLet's see if I can zoom in a little\nbit better, there we go, okay.\n\n40\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.220\nI think that's at least\nlegible at this point.\n\n41\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look here.\n\n42\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.020\nIf I get access into the device itself,\nI want to do a dir for directory.\n\n43\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.340\nAnd when I do so,\n\n44\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.240\nnotice what it shows me here is\nthe directory of what is stored in flash.\n\n45\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.850\nNow if you remember back from the earliest\nepisodes when we first started talking\n\n46\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.940\nabout the networking equipment itself and\nCisco.\n\n47\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; There is gonna be RAM that we have.\n\n48\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.650\nThere's also gonna be\nwhat is called NVRAM,\n\n49\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.530\nwhich is the non volatile RAM\nthat's also out there for us.\n\n50\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.930\nAnd then we have flash storage itself.\n\n51\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.500\nFlash storage is equivalent\nto a hard drive on a PC,\n\n52\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.480\nRAM is equivalent to the RAM\nthat we have on a laptop or PC.\n\n53\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.528\nNVRAM is persistent memory.\n\n54\n00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:51.360\nAnd that is, when we reboot a device,\nit has the ability to keep files there.\n\n55\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.680\nAnd then it can have that file be\npersistent through reboots and\n\n56\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.715\nnot get carried off or\ndeleted at some point.\n\n57\n00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we also have NVRAM here, but\n\n58\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.550\nflash is what we're looking at.\n\n59\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.180\nWe're essentially looking at the hard\ndrive of this particular device itself.\n\n60\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.770\nOkay, so when we take a look\nat this hard drive here,\n\n61\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.110\nlet's see, it tells me how\nmuch is being used right here.\n\n62\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.527\nSo if I actually take a look at this,\nthe hundreds, the 300,000 here.\n\n63\n00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:29.710\n261 million, so that's about 26 megs or\nso, or 261 megs, something like that.\n\n64\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.440\nWhatever it might be.\n\n65\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.890\nI can't remember exactly what\nthe numbers are, but yeah, that.\n\n66\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.770\nAnd then,\nhow much is actually left open and free?\n\n67\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.395\nSo, here again, hundreds.\n\n68\n00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:42.432\n100,000 here and then 62 million.\n\n69\n00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:47.082\nSo it's taken up, 26 million is what it's,\nyeah, 26 million, I can't count.\n\n70\n00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:53.760\nSo about 26 million bytes,\nessentially 26 megabytes out of the 60,\n\n71\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.215\nlet's just round it up to 64 megabytes,\nokay?\n\n72\n00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:04.990\nAbout that much is actually there being\nused and then another 64 up here is free.\n\n73\n00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.500\nSo, let's say that overall it's got\nabout a hundred megabytes in this\n\n74\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.370\nflash storage right now,\nthat we're taking a look at, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.680\nNotice though on the very first line\nof this directory right here, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.630\nThis is going to be the iOS.\n\n77\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.330\nThe operating system\nsoftware is right here.\n\n78\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.780\nSo I can tell, c2900 tells me\nthe platform of the iOS that this is on.\n\n79\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.730\nUniversalk9 tells me the addition, and\nthat it also, with the k9 supports crypto.\n\n80\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.520\nThe m says that it's\ndesigned to run in memory.\n\n81\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.650\nThe z tells me it's stored as a zip file.\n\n82\n00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.780\nAnd then you have these other\noptions here too, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.357\nThe one that we're really concerned\nabout actually goes after the SPA,\n\n84\n00:04:53.357 --> 00:04:57.423\nthat's a feature set that we have,\nis this 152-4, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:57.423 --> 00:05:01.225\nSo this tells me that\nthis is version 15.2 and\n\n86\n00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:06.059\nthen whatever 4 is here, and\nthen M6 and then .bin, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:10.440\nThis is essentially the iOS\nstored in a compressed format.\n\n88\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.470\nWhen the router reboots and\ngoes through post and\n\n89\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.320\nthen it gets into the Bootstrap program.\n\n90\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.080\nThe Bootstrap program points at\nthe flash right here and it looks for\n\n91\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.870\nthe first bootable operating\nsystem that it finds.\n\n92\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.040\nAnd that's gonna be this one listed here.\n\n93\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.100\nThen it takes this and\nit brings it up into ram.\n\n94\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.747\nOkay, that's running on the router itself.\n\n95\n00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:36.780\nWhen it does that,\nit will expand it out and\n\n96\n00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.450\nthen you'll have the operating\nsystem running in RAM.\n\n97\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.230\nFrom that point, it will go to NVRAM and\n\n98\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.140\ntake the startup-config and\nplace that on top of the operating system.\n\n99\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.240\nAnd then it will bring you\nto the prompt that you and\n\n100\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.660\nI have been using throughout\nthis entire episode.\n\n101\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.770\nNow you can see in this\nlab environment though,\n\n102\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.290\npeople have been saving a lot\nof stuff to flash memory here.\n\n103\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.850\nAnd as long as the flash memory has big\nenough storage, that's perfectly fine.\n\n104\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.850\nBut if it doesn't, that's when it\nbecomes a little bit more hassle\n\n105\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.220\nthat we have to think about too, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.140\nSo right now if I take a look,\nthat's 100 and then there's 139,000 and\n\n107\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.970\nthere's 99 megabytes\nessentially is what this is.\n\n108\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.820\nSo, about a hundred megabytes of\nsize is what that one is doing.\n\n109\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.870\n&gt;&gt; The flash memory, when it gets full or\nto a certain point will start deleting,\n\n110\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Nope, yeah, it doesn't start delete it.\n\n111\n00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.370\n&gt;&gt; It just stops.\n\n112\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.620\n&gt;&gt; So, you won't be able to save\nanymore as it becomes full, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.380\nSo the great thing is, a lot of these\nactually have zero in size, which is good.\n\n114\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.620\nSo if someone had actually just created\nstuff that they didn't mean to,\n\n115\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.500\nI can see it says created and then yes.\n\n116\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.420\nI don't know what this IP address\nof some device, which is fine.\n\n117\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.951\nAnd here is actually a directory,\nwhich is right here too.\n\n118\n00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.890\nAnd I can see that with the letter d too,\nokay?\n\n119\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.309\nSo what the lab exam actually\nhas us doing is creating this\n\n120\n00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:59.005\ndirectory right here called old.ios, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:03.779\nAnd the way that we do that and we're\ngonna just overwrite this here is from\n\n122\n00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:09.100\nthe command prompt here is we can do\nan mkdir, which is for make directory.\n\n123\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.030\nThen we'll do old-ios,\n\n124\n00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.485\nand I'll just put a 1 on mine so\nthat we can see it as being made new.\n\n125\n00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:19.150\nAn press Enter, and\nnow it's gonna say, hey,\n\n126\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.510\nare you sure you wanna\ncreate that directory?\n\n127\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.470\nYes, I want to create that directory.\n\n128\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.040\nAnd you can verify now where it's\nactually created that directory.\n\n129\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.980\nNow what I want to do is I wanna\nmake a backup copy of this iOS,\n\n130\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.210\nbecause they can become corrupt here.\n\n131\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.820\nSo if I wanna make a backup copy,\n\n132\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.230\nI have a couple of options\nthat I have to be able to do.\n\n133\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:42.840\nSo I can copy from flash here, this line.\n\n134\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.430\nAnd the reason why I'm copying this,\nso I don't have to paste it in again.\n\n135\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.979\nSo let me go ahead and copy that.\n\n136\n00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:58.805\nThen, I can now paste it right here.\n\n137\n00:07:58.805 --> 00:08:01.098\nI gotta put the colon back.\n\n138\n00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:05.491\nI can copy the flash,\nthen I can tell it where to copy to.\n\n139\n00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:10.946\nAnd that's going to be flash:old-ios1/,\n\n140\n00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:15.045\nwhich is the folder I just created.\n\n141\n00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:20.320\nAnd press return, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.980\nNow, notice it says hey,\nhere's the destination filename,\n\n143\n00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.910\nis that what you want to do?\n\n144\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.836\nAnd now, it tells me something, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:25.836 --> 00:08:27.950\nSo it says there is an error in copying,\nand\n\n146\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.780\nthis is what I wanted to\nshow you right here, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.180\nThere's not enough space\nleft on this device.\n\n148\n00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.320\nRemember, I said that that\nwas actually about 100 megs?\n\n149\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.900\nThe iOS?\n\n150\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.380\nAnd I said that there's\nabout 62 megs free?\n\n151\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.840\n&gt;&gt; So it won't allow me to actually\ncopy anything else in there.\n\n152\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n&gt;&gt; So that is a problem that we might end\n\n153\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.290\nup having.\n\n154\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.490\nSo instead, let's go ahead and\ndo this cuz more than likely\n\n155\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.380\nthat means somebody else has actually\nalready copied this in there before.\n\n156\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.810\nSo let's delete a couple of things here.\n\n157\n00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.737\nSo we are going to delete At this point,\n\n158\n00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:07.467\ncolon, slash, delete/, sorry.\n\n159\n00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:14.167\nColon, backslash, old-ios.\n\n160\n00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:18.960\nAnd then, paste that in there.\n\n161\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.285\nAnd let's see if there's\nanything in there.\n\n162\n00:09:21.285 --> 00:09:22.850\nNow, it says are you sure\nyou want to delete it?\n\n163\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.630\nIf there's anything in there,\nit will go ahead and\n\n164\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.704\nshow me after I press Enter here.\n\n165\n00:09:26.704 --> 00:09:29.870\nOr it'll lock up like it just did.\n\n166\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.980\nOne of the two, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.000\nSo I'm trying to delete\nsomething out of here, and\n\n168\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.120\nthat's what it's doing, is just kind\nof holding it there for a moment, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.400\nSo if there is no place for\nme to be able to put it in there, right?\n\n170\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.280\nWell, I need to be able to\nback this up someplace else,\n\n171\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.190\nis what essentially ends up happening.\n\n172\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.100\nAnd that's what we also want to\ntake care of, if we can do that.\n\n173\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.620\nBut right now, for this one,\nit looks like it is having\n\n174\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.850\nnot exactly the best day in\nthe world to be able to do this.\n\n175\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.190\nLet's see if we can switch\non over to NYEDGE2 here, and\n\n176\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.970\nshow you another way to do this,\nall right?\n\n177\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.685\nLet me zoom back out here and\nget to NYEDGE2.\n\n178\n00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:08.730\nIt's actually right down here, never mind.\n\n179\n00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:09.810\nWe'll try it on this one now.\n\n180\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.832\nSee what we can do.\n\n181\n00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:21.578\nCome on.\n\n182\n00:10:21.578 --> 00:10:22.763\nYou can do it.\n\n183\n00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:30.340\nAll right, so for one reason or\nanother, my NYEEDGE1 has locked up.\n\n184\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.050\nI can't get access into it.\n\n185\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.360\nBut I did scroll down to another router,\nand so that way we can get access into it.\n\n186\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.290\nAnd actually I scrolled down to a switch.\n\n187\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.230\nRemember I said that, a lot of times,\nright, those commands will actually\n\n188\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.680\nwork just about the same,\nso we don't worry about it.\n\n189\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.830\nBut the key was to remember\nthat we had just backed it up.\n\n190\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.099\nBut now, I don't have enough space, and\nit's barking at me, and it's locked up and\n\n191\n00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:54.074\nI can't do anything with that router.\n\n192\n00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:57.229\nSo I just rebooted it, and\nwe'll see what happens from there.\n\n193\n00:10:57.229 --> 00:11:01.003\nNow, on NYCORE1, the goal of this, right,\nwas to say look, even though you can back\n\n194\n00:11:01.003 --> 00:11:04.530\nit up to the flash, it's probably\nnot the safest place for storage.\n\n195\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.980\nZach, if you think about it, right,\nif that router goes up in flames and\n\n196\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.750\nI have a backup of my iOS to the router\nthat's gone up in flames, that's terrible.\n\n197\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.370\nThat's not exactly something\nwe would want to do, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Lost it all.\n\n199\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.970\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna do, though,\ninstead, is we're gonna point this\n\n200\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.916\nparticular switch here, NYCORE1, instead\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna say look,\n\n201\n00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:29.010\nlets not back up the iOS to, the device\nitself, but let's back this up to,\n\n202\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.450\nlets say, a server that is actually\nout there somewhere else too, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.400\nSo, lets go over here, and over on\nthe lab machine that's provided for you,\n\n204\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.490\nmake sure that you turn this on as well,\nyou're going to select TFTP32D.\n\n205\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.920\nAnd when you do so,\njust click on that TFTP Server tab and\n\n206\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.690\nmake sure that this is the IP address of\nthis interface, which it actually is.\n\n207\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.060\nAnd then, from NYCORE1,\n\n208\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.060\nI want to verify that I can gain\naccess to that server, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:04.095\nSo then,\nI'm gonna just ping 192.168.16.10.\n\n210\n00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:08.370\nAnd see what happens here and\nwhat's going on.\n\n211\n00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:13.470\nIt says hey, I can't ping this as well,\nso let's check it out.\n\n212\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.324\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n213\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.110\nAnd let me see, here, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.610\nBut I see why I don't have an IP\naddress assigned to it, so\n\n215\n00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.240\nI'm going to just assign an IP address.\n\n216\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.860\nAt least, I think I'm going to\nassign an IP address to this thing.\n\n217\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.290\nAnd that way,\nwe'll be able to gain access in here, too.\n\n218\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.516\nBut if I go into the interface vlan 1.\n\n219\n00:12:33.516 --> 00:12:35.289\nLet me give an IP address 192.168.\n\n220\n00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:39.860\nWe'll do 16.11 at this point,\njust to make sure I'm\n\n221\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.310\noutside of the range of any other\ndevice that's happening there.\n\n222\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.895\nAnd do a no shutdown.\n\n223\n00:12:46.895 --> 00:12:54.156\nNow, lets do a ping 192.168.16.10.\n\n224\n00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:59.586\nDo ping 192.168.16.10.\n\n225\n00:13:01.463 --> 00:13:02.290\nAnd there we go.\n\n226\n00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.600\nWe have success,\nwhich is what we're hoping for, right?\n\n227\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:11.502\nSo now that I have a successful\nconnection, which is perfectly good for\n\n228\n00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:15.880\nme, I want to be able to\ntake that iOS on here.\n\n229\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.854\nShow flash And\n\n230\n00:13:20.854 --> 00:13:23.720\nI want to copy that over\nto my TFTP server, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.740\nSo that's the one I want.\n\n232\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.530\nSo I'm going to copy this right now.\n\n233\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.500\nCuz it's gonna ask me for that name.\n\n234\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.637\nI'm gonna copy it.\n\n235\n00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:35.618\nThen, I issue the command copy flash:\n\n236\n00:13:38.297 --> 00:13:42.707\nAnd then, I'm going to paste it, and TFTP.\n\n237\n00:13:42.707 --> 00:13:45.090\nNow, do I have to actually put\nthat in there or write that?\n\n238\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.460\nNo, I don't.\n\n239\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.975\nSo let me show you\nthe way I normally do it,\n\n240\n00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:50.970\ncuz I won't remember if I don't\ndo it the same way, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.100\nI normally do copy flash tftp.\n\n242\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.300\nWhere it's just about the command itself,\nright?\n\n243\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.820\nSo what I'm saying is copy\nfrom flash to tftp, and\n\n244\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.370\nthen I'm gonna answer the questions.\n\n245\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.940\nAnd now, it's gonna ask me for\nthe source name, and\n\n246\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.900\nthis is where I would\npaste in the source name.\n\n247\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.339\nThen, it's gonna say 192.168.16.10.\n\n248\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.370\nIs where it's supposed to go.\n\n249\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.000\nAnd it's gonna say is this\ndestination name okay?\n\n250\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.800\nAnd inside of those square\nbrackets it means the default.\n\n251\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.950\nAnd as you see the exclamation points,\n\n252\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.000\nthat is actually what shows\nyou it is beginning its copy.\n\n253\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.170\nNow, it may take a little time because\nit is copying across a network, and\n\n254\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:35.840\nit is about 100,\nalmost about 18 megabytes, which is fine.\n\n255\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.740\nNow, let's take a look and\nsee if we can, there it goes, okay.\n\n256\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.810\nSo now, you're actually seeing it\ngetting copied over the network as well.\n\n257\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.030\nAnd so, this is good.\n\n258\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.490\nBecause even if that switch\nnow goes up in flames,\n\n259\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.010\nthe iOS will get backed\nup over here as well.\n\n260\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.360\nNow, in an earlier episode,\nwe did this with the running config file,\n\n261\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.250\nwe did this with the startup\nconfig file as well.\n\n262\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Yep, sure did.\n\n263\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.080\n&gt;&gt; So you may want to choose to do that,\n\n264\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.740\nand that's actually something\nthat's actually really good for\n\n265\n00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.490\nus to be able to do if that's\nsomething else that we want, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.280\nSo it's really a good idea that\nwe do something like this instead\n\n267\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.690\nof just copying it as\nanother file inside of Flash.\n\n268\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.640\nAnd that was really the whole goal,\n\n269\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.040\neven though our machine\nhas pretty much locked up.\n\n270\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.970\nAnd we'll just let this run\nin the background here.\n\n271\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.620\nAnd I'm gonna see if I can use NYEDGE to\n\n272\n00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.340\nhelp us with the rest of this right now,\nokay?\n\n273\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.770\nSo now that we've got that backed up,\n\n274\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.700\nlet's take a look at the version\nof this thing, too, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.254\nSo if I type in show version.\n\n276\n00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:36.220\nAnd I'm looking for\na couple of things here, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.431\nI want to see, first of all, okay,\nlet's see just a few things.\n\n278\n00:15:41.431 --> 00:15:46.510\nOf course, you wanna be able to see\nwhat the name of that iOS is gonna be.\n\n279\n00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.980\nSo, there's the actually system image.\n\n280\n00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.960\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n281\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.853\nAnd you want that version number\nis what you're looking at.\n\n282\n00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:56.484\nAnd then, to actually find that,\nyou can hit the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n283\n00:15:56.484 --> 00:16:01.458\nSo we can come down here and we can also\nsee some licensing information, too.\n\n284\n00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.776\nSo, it's under licensing information,\nthat today,\n\n285\n00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:07.890\nhere's the Cisco license for\nwhat device it's on.\n\n286\n00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.880\nYou also have the K9 for\nthe additional security.\n\n287\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.520\nYou can even see what technology\nthe version supports here.\n\n288\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.876\nIP base is permanent,\nsecurity K9 is also permanent.\n\n289\n00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:25.120\nAnd then data K9 is permanent as well, but\nthe other thing we're also looking for\n\n290\n00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.700\nis here too,\nwhich is this configuration register too.\n\n291\n00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.710\nSo we'll be paying attention to that\nin just a few minutes to help us out.\n\n292\n00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.420\nAll right, once I get to this point,\nI wanna do a show all.\n\n293\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.680\nShow licensing or license.\n\n294\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.980\nMake sure I spell that right, license all.\n\n295\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.840\nAnd now we can see some details as well\nin just a moment when it comes up.\n\n296\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.774\nSo once you start doing that you\ncan even see what the individual\n\n297\n00:16:54.774 --> 00:16:59.681\npackages are about and whether or\nnot it's active and in use too.\n\n298\n00:16:59.681 --> 00:17:03.350\nYou actually see just everything\nthat's active and in use.\n\n299\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.780\nOkay and there's kind of something\na little bit interesting here\n\n300\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.780\nthat you might not actually\nget to hear too often.\n\n301\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.940\nThere is this weird thing\nabout the licensing state.\n\n302\n00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.110\nNotice it says evaluation period total.\n\n303\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.600\nSo Cisco kind of has an honor system where\nthey say you can evaluate this license if\n\n304\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.950\nyou can get it and you can do it and\nit gives you a time period.\n\n305\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.250\nSo this will actually allow you\nto evaluate for eight weeks and\n\n306\n00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.930\nfour days as you continue to do this.\n\n307\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.890\nBut you also end up noticing\nthat even after eight weeks and\n\n308\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.280\nfour days it will still continue to work.\n\n309\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.250\nSo they're expecting you of\ncourse to buy the license\n\n310\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.810\nwhen it's actually in use here, but notice\nif it's not, you'll actually see like\n\n311\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.740\nright here where it says the not in\nuse and not licensed at this point.\n\n312\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.710\nSo it will let you do this on\na permanent trial basis as well.\n\n313\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.900\nAs long as you have the equipment,\nyou're perfectly fine to do so.\n\n314\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.540\nSo you can turn on certain features, but\n\n315\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.500\nif you want to add in additional features,\nyou have to again\n\n316\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.150\nupgrade that license at that particular\npoint in time if you need to.\n\n317\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:09.820\nAll right, so that brings us to where we\nreally want to go next which is by far,\n\n318\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.244\nprobably the harder of the concepts\nthat we have to actually be able to do,\n\n319\n00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:15.580\nwhich is password recovery.\n\n320\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.800\nSo let's go ahead and talk about that.\n\n321\n00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.120\nSo, when we start talking about\nthis idea of password recovery,\n\n322\n00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.480\nhere's what ends up happening.\n\n323\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.060\nThe reason why we tend to do it more often\nis we set the password on this device and\n\n324\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.540\nwe don't touch it for years.\n\n325\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.820\nAnd I literally mean that, you may not\ntouch these devices again for years.\n\n326\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.661\nSometimes you will,\n\n327\n00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.730\nyou're not really working with\nthe same device every single day.\n\n328\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.050\nSo it's easy to lose\ntrack of the password.\n\n329\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.590\nAnd if you lose track of the password,\n\n330\n00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.625\nyou can't gain access\nback to the device again.\n\n331\n00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:43.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n332\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.750\nthat means that what you may have to do is\nimplement some type of password security.\n\n333\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.050\nThe other thing that also happens, and\nmore common, is if you're replacing\n\n334\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.940\ndevices and if your company says look, we\ncan't afford to buy brand new from Cisco.\n\n335\n00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.570\nYou're probably gonna do like the rest\nof the world, which is go to eBay, and\n\n336\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.320\nbuy used equipment.\n\n337\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.060\nUsed equipment will function normally,\nokay?\n\n338\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.590\nSo never get one that says not\nfunctional or for parts only.\n\n339\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.771\nThat usually tells you\nit's non-functional.\n\n340\n00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So get one that says, hey look,\n\n341\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.870\nit was operational, it worked, and\nthat there's a guarantee that it works.\n\n342\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.400\nThat is what you wanna pick up.\n\n343\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.960\nNow when you do stuff like that\nmore than likely that seller has\n\n344\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.520\nbought equipment from\na company that's closed down.\n\n345\n00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.330\nAnd they might have taken time to turn\nit on and verify that it booted up.\n\n346\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.807\nThey might not have done anything else.\n\n347\n00:19:28.807 --> 00:19:32.842\nSo you may end up getting a router which\nessentially has a configuration of another\n\n348\n00:19:32.842 --> 00:19:34.100\ncompany on it.\n\n349\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.290\nAt some point, and more than likely that\nmeans you're not going to be able to get\n\n350\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.490\naccess into it very easily.\n\n351\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.790\nSo the way that you can do that,\nthough, if you buy it, remember,\n\n352\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.650\nit's going to be out of its service\nagreement if you do buy that.\n\n353\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.610\nAnd that means if you want full service,\nyou're gonna have to go back into and\n\n354\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.230\ntalk to Cisco and\nget whatever licenses, upgrades, and\n\n355\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.350\nwhatever that's gonna cost\nyou to make that thing work.\n\n356\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.763\nBut you may have to be able\nto recover the password so\n\n357\n00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.963\nthat you can gain access\nback into the device.\n\n358\n00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:00.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n359\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.180\nthat's what we want to talk about\ntoday is how is it that we can do\n\n360\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.530\nsomething like this.\n\n361\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.060\nSo in your lab setting,\nyou'll actually see that in the lab guide.\n\n362\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.770\nIt talks about it, it's like, here is all\nthe steps that you'll do as you do this.\n\n363\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.970\nBut you also see in a red box that\nsays don't do these on our lab, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.510\nCuz they don't want you doing this\non their labs and resetting it and\n\n365\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.680\ndoing all that stuff.\n\n366\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.110\nWhat they want you to do is say look,\nhere's what the steps are but yes,\n\n367\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.120\nyou won't do this on the labs here, but\n\n368\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.380\nwe're gonna show you how to\ndo it with real equipment,\n\n369\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.410\ncuz usually you do need to be in the same\nphysical room as the device normally.\n\n370\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.080\nYou have to be able to do that.\n\n371\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.530\nSo that's what we're\ngonna show you too okay?\n\n372\n00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.770\nNow where does it begin though.\n\n373\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.630\nLet's take a look at the screen again and\n\n374\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.790\nthen we'll start talking about\nsome of the configurations.\n\n375\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.800\nIt begins with what we call\nthe configuration register.\n\n376\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.602\nNow the configuration register is\ndifferent in it's not normally stored\n\n377\n00:20:50.602 --> 00:20:52.325\ninside of the start of -config.\n\n378\n00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:56.254\nIt's stored somewhere else in another\nlittle compartment inside of NVram\n\n379\n00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:57.790\nsomewhere.\n\n380\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.090\nOr even maybe inside of its own little\nmemory box, for all I know, okay.\n\n381\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.720\nIt is out there and this essentially\ncan change the way that the device\n\n382\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.530\noperates and boots up, and does things.\n\n383\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:14.570\nSo when you see this, and you see these\nnumbers here, it means something special.\n\n384\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:19.390\nOkay so you type in show version, you'll\nsee what the configuration register is.\n\n385\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:26.470\nOn this one, it is already set to what we\ncall the password recovery mode, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.840\nSo I've made a simple diagram\nto help us to understand this\n\n387\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.470\na little bit better okay?\n\n388\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.540\nThat configuration register itself right?\n\n389\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.660\nAshley changes the behavior\nto how the router boots up.\n\n390\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.370\nSo you can tell it to boot directly\ninto what's called ROMmon,\n\n391\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:46.430\nwhich is a very limited form\nof the operating system.\n\n392\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.150\nIf you're familiar in the windows world,\n\n393\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.839\nconsider it something like safe\nmode in the Windows world, okay.\n\n394\n00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:54.714\nYou can also do a network boot which\nmeans, hey look there's no operating\n\n395\n00:21:54.714 --> 00:21:57.401\nsystem really on here until\nyou actually boot up and\n\n396\n00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:01.340\nyou get a copy of it from the network\ndevice somewhere else too.\n\n397\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.100\nYou can also change\nthe options while booting up.\n\n398\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.820\nYou can tell it to ignore\nwhatever configuration on it or\n\n399\n00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.110\nto disable any boot messages at all.\n\n400\n00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.410\nAnd even change to console speed.\n\n401\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.470\nNormally I would not do this.\n\n402\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:17.630\nMost of the Cisco devices\nare set at what's called the 8n1\n\n403\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.870\nconfiguration for\nthat and a speed of 9600.\n\n404\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:27.480\nSo that means the idea of 8 bits and\nthen N for none on the parody and\n\n405\n00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.990\nthen one for the flow or something like\nthat, so just be aware of that too, okay?\n\n406\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.760\nNow, here's the two most common ones and\n\n407\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.890\nthis is what we're gonna be dealing with,\nokay?\n\n408\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.767\nThe, 0x2102, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:45.610\nThis essentially is just kinda\nthe regular startup here, right.\n\n410\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.580\nLoads the iOS from the Flash memory.\n\n411\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.920\nIt doesn't wait at that.\n\n412\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.210\nSo, no break.\n\n413\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.549\nAnd then immediately begins to\nload the startup configuration.\n\n414\n00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:59.390\nOkay, so that's what the 0x2102 does.\n\n415\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.240\nThat is normally the default\non every router.\n\n416\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.477\nIf you happen to do a show version,\nand it's a 0x2142, okay.\n\n417\n00:23:07.477 --> 00:23:10.711\nWell, this is gonna load up\nthe IOS from the flash memory,\n\n418\n00:23:10.711 --> 00:23:15.150\nit's gonna skip the break, but\nit's gonna ignore the startup config.\n\n419\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.040\nOkay, is what it's gonna do.\n\n420\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.330\nNow, you might be wondering like,\n\n421\n00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.070\nwhy the heck do we want to\nignore the startup config?\n\n422\n00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.950\nCuz if you ignore the startup config,\n\n423\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.430\nall you're doing is you're loading\nessentially a just standard\n\n424\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:30.300\nvanilla edition of the Cisco IOS\nwithout any passwords in it, okay.\n\n425\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.570\nThen once you do that, you can then go\nahead and make a copy of the startup\n\n426\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:41.120\nconfig into the running config at that\npoint and then change the passwords.\n\n427\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.360\nThen you save it again and then you\nchange the configuration register.\n\n428\n00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.105\nThen you reboot and now you've\nactually changed the password, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:48.105 --> 00:23:49.808\nSo it's a bit of a step, but\n\n430\n00:23:49.808 --> 00:23:53.448\nwe'll step through it to show\nyou how this is done, okay?\n\n431\n00:23:53.448 --> 00:23:58.110\nNow we're gonna be using a router\nto actually do our configuration.\n\n432\n00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.057\nTo make sure that this ends up half, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:01.057 --> 00:24:02.841\nBut can this be done on a switch?\n\n434\n00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:08.704\nYes, so I just showed you, like on,\nactually, on NY edge here.\n\n435\n00:24:08.704 --> 00:24:13.674\nThis is a router and this is that 2142,\nwhich means this is read for reboot, and\n\n436\n00:24:13.674 --> 00:24:15.175\nwhen it reboots, okay?\n\n437\n00:24:15.175 --> 00:24:18.239\nIt's gonna reboot and it's not gonna\nload up the startup config again.\n\n438\n00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:21.662\nSo, but we're not actually doing that\ncuz it's asking us not to do so.\n\n439\n00:24:21.662 --> 00:24:26.945\nOn NY Core 1, which is a switch here,\nlet me type in show version.\n\n440\n00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:31.314\nAnd let me zoom in so that we can see it.\n\n441\n00:24:31.314 --> 00:24:32.804\nNotice it does the same thing.\n\n442\n00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:34.753\nIt shows all the information.\n\n443\n00:24:34.753 --> 00:24:36.703\nAnd now,\nyou can take a look at something else.\n\n444\n00:24:36.703 --> 00:24:41.250\nLook at that,\nt hat's a strange one there, OxF.\n\n445\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.331\nInstead of the 2102,\nwhich is normal for everything, okay?\n\n446\n00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:48.480\nWhenever you see something like this here,\nokay?\n\n447\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.271\nThere's one of two things that you'll\nhave to actually be able to do with\n\n448\n00:24:51.271 --> 00:24:52.106\nthe switch instead.\n\n449\n00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:54.084\nAnd this is why I'm describing it.\n\n450\n00:24:54.084 --> 00:24:55.445\nSo, if the router or\n\n451\n00:24:55.445 --> 00:25:00.348\nthe switch itself has where you can\nchange the configuration register.\n\n452\n00:25:00.348 --> 00:25:02.255\nLet's see if this is possible.\n\n453\n00:25:02.255 --> 00:25:08.457\nIf I go in here and I go, config dash or\nconfiguration, now let's see.\n\n454\n00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:13.546\nOr actually is config-register.\n\n455\n00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:17.865\nLet's see if it actually has that option.\n\n456\n00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:18.909\nIt doesn't even have the option.\n\n457\n00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:23.343\nSo, I can't go into password recovery\nmode by using this command to change that\n\n458\n00:25:23.343 --> 00:25:24.873\nconfiguration register.\n\n459\n00:25:24.873 --> 00:25:27.431\nBut that's what you do,\nyou type in config-register.\n\n460\n00:25:27.431 --> 00:25:30.443\nAnd you would change it to that number,\n\n461\n00:25:30.443 --> 00:25:35.025\nwhich is gonna be 0X2142 for\npassword recovery mode.\n\n462\n00:25:35.025 --> 00:25:36.831\nBut what if I can't change it?\n\n463\n00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:39.746\nThis is where you have to go\nto the front of the device.\n\n464\n00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:44.116\nAnd you have to hold down the actual\nbutton on the front of the device itself,\n\n465\n00:25:44.116 --> 00:25:45.904\nand get through the sequence.\n\n466\n00:25:45.904 --> 00:25:49.251\nYou'll have to look at the sequence cuz\nit's dependent on the platform that\n\n467\n00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:49.834\nyou're on.\n\n468\n00:25:49.834 --> 00:25:53.895\nBut you'll look up the sequence, and\nthen tell you hold the button down for\n\n469\n00:25:53.895 --> 00:25:55.971\n15 seconds until the light blinks.\n\n470\n00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:59.011\nYou'll see it blink like amber,\nlike once or twice.\n\n471\n00:25:59.011 --> 00:26:01.673\nAnd then, you have to hold it\ndown until all of a sudden,\n\n472\n00:26:01.673 --> 00:26:04.063\nit actually just continues\nto blink rapidly now.\n\n473\n00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:06.055\nIt's weird,\nyou have to actually be able to do that.\n\n474\n00:26:06.055 --> 00:26:10.408\nAnd then, at that point, it'll boot you\ninto a very limited mode that you can now\n\n475\n00:26:10.408 --> 00:26:12.984\ndo the same thing but\nwith different commands.\n\n476\n00:26:12.984 --> 00:26:15.647\nSo, we're not gonna run\nthrough all of that, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:15.647 --> 00:26:18.619\nSo, if you're on a switch,\nit's a bit harder to actually do.\n\n478\n00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:20.057\nThat's what I'm trying to tell you.\n\n479\n00:26:20.057 --> 00:26:22.298\nOn a router, a bit easier to do.\n\n480\n00:26:22.298 --> 00:26:24.885\nAnd this is the one that we were\ngonna practice on here, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:24.885 --> 00:26:27.125\nIs setting up that password recovery.\n\n482\n00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:29.655\nSo, let's take a look at ours here.\n\n483\n00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:35.149\nAnd so, I've brought up a real\nrouter to help us out and\n\n484\n00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:39.220\nI just typed in that, here we go, okay.\n\n485\n00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.382\nNow, here what we're actually seeing\nthis is actually a form of a banner.\n\n486\n00:26:42.382 --> 00:26:43.710\nIs what your seeing here.\n\n487\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.986\nSo, notice how it actually put the box\naround it and all that other stuff.\n\n488\n00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:50.327\nAnd you'll see that I've got a lot\nof different interfaces on this\n\n489\n00:26:50.327 --> 00:26:52.543\nparticular router itself, which is fine.\n\n490\n00:26:52.543 --> 00:26:55.424\nSo now, that I'm on here,\nI'm gonna go into enable.\n\n491\n00:26:55.424 --> 00:27:00.336\nAnd I just, I did a fresh, reset,\nback to factory default on this device.\n\n492\n00:27:00.336 --> 00:27:03.048\nAnd that's why you're seeing things\ncome up and down and everything is like,\n\n493\n00:27:03.048 --> 00:27:03.552\nare you sure?\n\n494\n00:27:03.552 --> 00:27:05.954\nYeah, it's going through and\nit's testing out every single port.\n\n495\n00:27:05.954 --> 00:27:08.651\nEverything is coming up,\nall that stuff, okay?\n\n496\n00:27:08.651 --> 00:27:10.296\nSo, if I do a show version.\n\n497\n00:27:11.694 --> 00:27:15.269\nOf course, we'll end up seeing\nthat bootstrap is fine.\n\n498\n00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:20.251\nHere's the version that I'm running,\n15.1-3 here.\n\n499\n00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:22.612\nThere's licencing information and\n\n500\n00:27:22.612 --> 00:27:28.028\nnotice there is normally the regular\nregister that we're actually seeing, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:28.028 --> 00:27:29.805\nSo, that configuration register.\n\n502\n00:27:29.805 --> 00:27:33.476\nNow, if I got this device and\ncouldn't get access into this, okay.\n\n503\n00:27:33.476 --> 00:27:37.558\nThis is where you would have to\nactually be able to do something else.\n\n504\n00:27:37.558 --> 00:27:40.271\nBut the good thing is,\nwe're already in here, okay?\n\n505\n00:27:40.271 --> 00:27:46.448\nSo, if I needed a password recovery here,\nand I could get into it, it's fairly easy.\n\n506\n00:27:46.448 --> 00:27:53.485\nYou do config, dash Register,\nand then 0x2142, okay?\n\n507\n00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:57.129\n0x2142, press Enter, and\n\n508\n00:27:57.129 --> 00:28:02.472\nnow you're like, well,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n509\n00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:06.565\nWell, this is where you must reload the\nrouter, and have to essentially reboot.\n\n510\n00:28:11.699 --> 00:28:15.576\nAll right, so, I'm not gonna worry about\nsaving the configuration at this point.\n\n511\n00:28:15.576 --> 00:28:19.169\nAnd let me go ahead and proceed here,\nand confirm the reload.\n\n512\n00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:20.447\nSo during this point, right?\n\n513\n00:28:20.447 --> 00:28:22.991\nAs the router is actually reloading,\nit's ramping up,\n\n514\n00:28:22.991 --> 00:28:24.849\nit's doing everything that it needs to.\n\n515\n00:28:24.849 --> 00:28:26.788\nBut, it's gonna reboot and\nwhen it does so,\n\n516\n00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:29.098\nit's going to change that\nconfiguration register.\n\n517\n00:28:29.098 --> 00:28:33.289\nNow, I didn't really change\nanything in its configuration.\n\n518\n00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:36.810\nPerfectly fine, but it shouldn't,\nif it doesn't have anything,\n\n519\n00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.155\nit doesn't worry about.\n\n520\n00:28:38.155 --> 00:28:42.861\nBut if there was a startup config,\nit would now ignore the startup config.\n\n521\n00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:47.818\nAnd when it does so, it would just boot\ninto a copy of the cis iOS and load it up.\n\n522\n00:28:47.818 --> 00:28:49.936\nAs what we would actually\nend up seeing here.\n\n523\n00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:51.764\nAnd then, I would have a blank copy.\n\n524\n00:28:51.764 --> 00:28:55.466\nI'd be ready to configure it, it's just\nlike the very beginning in what we saw\n\n525\n00:28:55.466 --> 00:28:58.400\nhere where nothing is configured,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n526\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.338\nNow, once we do that,\nif there is a copy of the start up config,\n\n527\n00:29:03.338 --> 00:29:06.337\nI copy that over into running config.\n\n528\n00:29:06.337 --> 00:29:09.908\nSo when I copy that over\ninto running config, I now,\n\n529\n00:29:09.908 --> 00:29:13.488\ncan gain access by doing\na show running dash config.\n\n530\n00:29:13.488 --> 00:29:16.220\nThen, I can start changing the password.\n\n531\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.964\nIf I have an enabled secret,\nI can patch in, no enable secret.\n\n532\n00:29:20.964 --> 00:29:23.293\nThen, I can actually\nthe in enable secret and\n\n533\n00:29:23.293 --> 00:29:25.450\nchange to to whatever password I want to.\n\n534\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.073\nSame thing with the user name and\npassword combination as well.\n\n535\n00:29:29.073 --> 00:29:32.041\nIf I wanna eliminate all the other\nuser names that were on this thing,\n\n536\n00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:35.480\nI could simply go ahead and type in the\nword no, and eliminate most of those too.\n\n537\n00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.199\nAnd then,\ncreate the ones that I want to, and\n\n538\n00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:41.859\nthat brings me back into the router and\nwhat we end up seeing.\n\n539\n00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:46.730\nSo here on this device, it may take a few\nminutes the way that we want it to,\n\n540\n00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.732\nyou know,\nbefore it actually comes back up.\n\n541\n00:29:49.732 --> 00:29:51.661\nBut that's essentially\nwhat you're seeing here.\n\n542\n00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:56.621\nSo, let's make sure that I write\nthis stuff down in the logical order\n\n543\n00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:57.828\nthat we need to.\n\n544\n00:29:57.828 --> 00:30:00.946\nTo have you understand\nit a little bit better.\n\n545\n00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:03.317\nSo, on password recovery, okay?\n\n546\n00:30:03.317 --> 00:30:06.561\nThis way, we'll kind of use our\ntime wisely instead of having to.\n\n547\n00:30:06.561 --> 00:30:08.502\nGo just to a break here, okay?\n\n548\n00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:14.647\nSo, let's make sure we understand\nthe steps, Of password recovery.\n\n549\n00:30:20.869 --> 00:30:23.061\nRight now, there's a couple of\nother things that we'll have to do.\n\n550\n00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:25.570\nBut let's just do this for\nright now, okay?\n\n551\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.873\nSo, the first step for\nwhat we might want to do, okay?\n\n552\n00:30:28.873 --> 00:30:37.474\nIs that we want to reset\nthe configuration register, or\n\n553\n00:30:37.474 --> 00:30:42.598\nset the config dash register to,\n\n554\n00:30:42.598 --> 00:30:46.441\n0x2142 to we want to\n\n555\n00:30:46.441 --> 00:30:51.477\nreboot, Or reload the router.\n\n556\n00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:58.810\nAll right, so, if I have that,\nthen we reload the router here.\n\n557\n00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.181\nOkay, once it's done reloading, right?\n\n558\n00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:09.363\nWe will have essentially a copy\nof the iOS with no configuration.\n\n559\n00:31:09.363 --> 00:31:16.252\nSo, loaded into ram, Is a copy of,\n\n560\n00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:26.812\nThe iOS without the configuration here.\n\n561\n00:31:26.812 --> 00:31:32.032\nOr we'll select NO to\n\n562\n00:31:32.032 --> 00:31:38.993\nthe configuration wizard.\n\n563\n00:31:38.993 --> 00:31:41.844\nAnd then, five at the start-up,\nat the prompt.\n\n564\n00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:50.165\nThe prompt, we will go ahead and\nget access to privilege exec mode.\n\n565\n00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.092\nMode.\n\n566\n00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:03.252\nAnd then from here,\nonce we do that and we're already in,\n\n567\n00:32:03.252 --> 00:32:06.100\nwithout any configuration here, okay.\n\n568\n00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.468\nIf we have a startup config,\nwe'll do a copy,\n\n569\n00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.134\nstartup -config space running\n\n570\n00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:21.682\n-config to load the running-config.\n\n571\n00:32:24.395 --> 00:32:30.353\nAll right, then, Change the passwords.\n\n572\n00:32:31.873 --> 00:32:36.150\nNow we are not done once everything\nis actually done that way.\n\n573\n00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.809\nAnd once you change the passwords,\n\n574\n00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:43.155\nthe eighth step is to change\nthe configuration register,\n\n575\n00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:51.701\nBack to 0x2102.\n\n576\n00:32:51.701 --> 00:32:54.576\nAnd then nine is to reboot.\n\n577\n00:32:54.576 --> 00:33:01.730\nAnd when you do so, you should now be able\nto get access back into the router itself.\n\n578\n00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.520\nSo that is a little bit of\na long configuration, but\n\n579\n00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.310\nhere is where we go, okay?\n\n580\n00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:11.412\nSo now if I'm here, I type in no.\n\n581\n00:33:11.412 --> 00:33:13.410\nAnd there it goes,\nit's actually loading it up.\n\n582\n00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.120\nAnd this is the default of\nthe iOS itself that we have.\n\n583\n00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.632\nNow let's go through and\ndiscover all the interfaces here.\n\n584\n00:33:25.994 --> 00:33:30.931\nAnd now, which I don't have, if I had\nsomething in the startup configure, but\n\n585\n00:33:30.931 --> 00:33:32.050\nlet me do enable.\n\n586\n00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:37.510\nThis is where I would do a copy startup.\n\n587\n00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:43.074\n-config running-config.\n\n588\n00:33:43.074 --> 00:33:44.143\nOop!\n\n589\n00:33:51.392 --> 00:33:52.576\nToo many spaces here.\n\n590\n00:33:54.403 --> 00:33:57.010\nAnd it says there wasn't anything present,\nwhich is fine.\n\n591\n00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.560\nBut if I did have something in there,\nit would begin copying that over.\n\n592\n00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.430\nAnd at that point,\nthen I would change the passwords.\n\n593\n00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:10.340\nOnce everything is done, I would do a show\nversion, after I change all the passwords.\n\n594\n00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.110\nAnd I would come down here and verify, and\n\n595\n00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:16.940\nnotice where it says 2142 is where'd\nyou go back in at this point.\n\n596\n00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:23.859\nThen you would do a config, Register,\n\n597\n00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:31.971\nno config-register, 0x2102.\n\n598\n00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.850\nNow, it's not done yet, right?\n\n599\n00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:39.190\nSo before this actually takes place,\nyou'd have to reload it again.\n\n600\n00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.760\nOnce you reload it,\nthen you know that everything is done and\n\n601\n00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.040\nthen you verify that your passwords have\nactually taken place and changed and\n\n602\n00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.040\nall that, and then you're ready to go.\n\n603\n00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.910\nOn a switch, this will not be as easy,\n\n604\n00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:53.880\nthe commands are a bit more\ninvolved in doing that.\n\n605\n00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.480\nSo the key here, Zach, is good password\nmanagement is actually the key.\n\n606\n00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.780\nSo being able to keep track of that\nis what you want to be able to do to\n\n607\n00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.680\nmake sure it's all done.\n\n608\n00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.970\nAll right, Zach, from that point, that\nactually does end for us, the episode that\n\n609\n00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:13.830\nwe actually need here to take a look\nat the idea here of device management.\n\n610\n00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.140\nThere are concepts that we've also used\nthroughout our entire show here to\n\n611\n00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.110\nmake sure that you also understand\nsome of the other things as well\n\n612\n00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.350\nto make sure you review those, too.\n\n613\n00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.700\nBut this is probably by far the one\nthat you will not be able to practice\n\n614\n00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.245\nif you don't have access\nto real lab equipment.\n\n615\n00:35:28.245 --> 00:35:29.095\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Ronnie.\n\n616\n00:35:29.095 --> 00:35:32.785\nPerform device management,\ngreat episode as usual.\n\n617\n00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:35.445\nAnd before we leave what\nelse would you like to say?\n\n618\n00:35:35.445 --> 00:35:36.675\n&gt;&gt; Well, at this point, right,\n\n619\n00:35:36.675 --> 00:35:39.645\nmake sure that you are practicing\nevery day what you can.\n\n620\n00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:43.505\nThere are some of these you're not gonna\nbe able to practice very easily like what\n\n621\n00:35:43.505 --> 00:35:46.050\nwe just showed you unless\nyou have your own equipment.\n\n622\n00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.370\nAnd even with your own equipment,\n\n623\n00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.210\nbe careful about setting this\nstuff up when you do this.\n\n624\n00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.420\nAnd remember especially\nwith the password recovery,\n\n625\n00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.680\nknow those particular settings\nthat we told you about.\n\n626\n00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.000\nWe're not gonna really emphasize\nthe settings right now and\n\n627\n00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.630\nwhat they all mean cuz each one\nactually is different then.\n\n628\n00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.820\nAnd so there's more than\nthe two that we showed you.\n\n629\n00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.700\nBut at this point, make sure you\ncan just differentiate them and\n\n630\n00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.980\nknow one is for password recovery and\nthe other one is for, again,\n\n631\n00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:19.240\nthe idea here of regular normal\noperating mode is the key as well.\n\n632\n00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:25.950\nSo practice, practice, practice every\nday is what your goal is to be.\n\n633\n00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.790\nSo that you get everything that\nyou can in for what you want to.\n\n634\n00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.910\nReview everything as well, and\n\n635\n00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.900\nthen you will be ready for the exam\nas you continue on in your studies.\n\n636\n00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.960\n&gt;&gt; Well said, Ronnie.\n\n637\n00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.680\nCisco CCENT is a terrific series.\n\n638\n00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.140\nMake sure you watch every episode.\n\n639\n00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.475\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n640\n00:36:42.475 --> 00:36:44.790\nRonnie's done a great job\nputting it all together for you.\n\n641\n00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.080\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\n\n642\n00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.590\nand there's thousands of other\nvideos there to help you go further.\n\n643\n00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.010\nCheck those out, too.\n\n644\n00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.160\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n645\n00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.740\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n646\n00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.480\nThanks for watching.\n\n647\n00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.310\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n648\n00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n649\n00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.406\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon!\n\n650\n00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:05.387\n[MUSIC]\n\n651\n00:37:05.387 --> 00:37:08.691\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:11.995\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:13.797\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.148\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.869\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, you can tell we're having a lot\n\n9\n00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.093\nof fun because Ronnie and I are giggling\nlike a couple of school children.\n\n10\n00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:27.220\n[LAUGH] And joining me in the studio,\nwe're here for CCNT by the way.\n\n11\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.100\n[LAUGH] Joining me in the studio,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.660\nRonnie, welcome man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.290\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.660\nI wish I could remember what we're\nactually going to talk about right now.\n\n15\n00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.850\nBut, the great thing is I saw it on\nthe screen right before we started here.\n\n16\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.280\nIt's time for subnetting practice.\n\n17\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.570\nSo remember that when we start here and\nyou start to take a look, make sure you go\n\n18\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.600\nover those, subnetting, the videos that we\ndid on subnetting, that's gonna help you.\n\n19\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.780\nAnd also at this point,\nas you're doing subnetting practice,\n\n20\n00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.340\nwe're assuming that you will also gone\nover the quick tips that we gave you\n\n21\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.360\nin one of the episodes and\nunderstanding class B subnetting as well.\n\n22\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.182\nSo that way you are fast and\nyou are ready to go.\n\n23\n00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:10.896\nWhat we want to do in this episode is\ngo over some of the major types of\n\n24\n00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:14.940\nquestions that you're likely\nto see on any type of exam,\n\n25\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.923\nnot just Cisco exams,\nany type of exam for subnetting.\n\n26\n00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:22.933\nSo we're gonna show you as many as we\ncan in the time that we're given here,\n\n27\n00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.633\nto do this but\n\n28\n00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.980\nthen it's up to you to think about some of\nthe different ways that you can do that.\n\n29\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.876\nAnd we'll also of course have this in the\nnotes that are also gonna come along with\n\n30\n00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:36.045\nthe episode as well,\nthat way you can practice too.\n\n31\n00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:39.272\nBut any time you see something like this,\ntake advantage of it, because it only\n\n32\n00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:43.000\ngets you into the mindset for\nquestions that we'd likely actually see.\n\n33\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.831\nSo, Daniel, just like everything else,\nwe use relatively easy examples and\n\n34\n00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:49.817\nthis is where people get upset.\n\n35\n00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:52.997\nI can't believe that the only\nexample that we did was so easy and\n\n36\n00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:56.640\non the exam they're kind of\nrelatively not exactly the same.\n\n37\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.125\nSo we wanted to go over some of\nthe types that you're likely to see and\n\n38\n00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.796\nthat way you have a good understanding or\na understanding approach of,\n\n39\n00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:06.510\nmore than likely,\nwhat you'll see on subnetting.\n\n40\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.401\nAnd the great thing is it's\nrelatively limited, there's only so\n\n41\n00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:11.310\nmuch that they can ask you about it.\n\n42\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.260\nBut for the C-CENT, or the CCENT,\nI like to call it both here,\n\n43\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.790\nfor that exam in particular and\nalso for the CCNA,\n\n44\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.640\nyou will be peppered with\nsomething about subnet.\n\n45\n00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.350\nSo whether it's directly subnetting, or\nwhether it's surrounding subnetting,\n\n46\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.170\nin other words,\nyou already to know how to do it and\n\n47\n00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.500\nthen you have to give answers to it,\nyou're likely to see a question on that.\n\n48\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.340\nSo let's go ahead and dive in here and\ntake a look here at some of the questions\n\n49\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.190\nthat I have available that I've come up\nwith before the show here to help us out.\n\n50\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.330\nSo let's just go ahead and\nstart as we do this.\n\n51\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.820\nNow Daniel, if I had actually thought\nabout it a little bit better,\n\n52\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.950\nI could have actually had you sing or\n\n53\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.120\nwhistle the Jeopardy tune-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n54\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.084\n&gt;&gt; As we, no, let's not do that.\n\n55\n00:02:57.084 --> 00:02:58.320\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, I'll look it up.\n\n56\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.230\nAlexa, play [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.570\n&gt;&gt; So we'll just pretend here.\n\n58\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.970\nSo remember that your goal is to be able\nto take a question like what we're seeing\n\n59\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.680\nright here,\nwe've explained this a little bit already.\n\n60\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.240\nYou've gotta read through it,\nyou've got to understand this question and\n\n61\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.250\nthen answer it correctly.\n\n62\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.790\nAnd before you actually hit the next\nbutton to go on to the next question\n\n63\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.250\nyou confidently know the answer.\n\n64\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.870\nDo not press next until you go,\nthat is the right answer, period.\n\n65\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.080\nSo that's what we wanna do.\n\n66\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.360\nAnd we'll just take, like I said,\n\n67\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.960\nwhatever time that we have,\nwe'll do as many as we can.\n\n68\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.990\nAnd later on we may even come back and\ndo a couple of more episodes on this.\n\n69\n00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.070\nBut at least for right now we're\njust gonna do as many as we can\n\n70\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.470\nin the time we're allotted for\nthis episode.\n\n71\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.932\nSo Daniel, on the first question here,\nI've got this and\n\n72\n00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:49.807\nthis is where we start seeing these higher\nnumbers that I've been talking about in\n\n73\n00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:52.579\nthose previous episodes\non subnetting here.\n\n74\n00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.705\n172.16.195.223/19 and\n\n75\n00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:03.803\n172.16.222/19 are in which subnet?\n\n76\n00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:06.610\nNow that's when all of a sudden\nthe sweat starts to pour.\n\n77\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.334\n&gt;&gt; I already started to flop sweat and\npanic at this point in time.\n\n78\n00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:10.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nat this particular point in time and\n\n79\n00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.770\ntrying to determine what we need.\n\n80\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.940\nSo the great thing is if\nyou remember that magic\n\n81\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.430\nnumber method that we've been\ntalking about, the key, of course,\n\n82\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.798\nis that you know that number,\n256 is the magic number.\n\n83\n00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:30.350\nYou know that, you memorize that,\nyou are good, not 265, not 223, 256.\n\n84\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.581\nAnd now you need to know what the subnet\nmask is and the actionable octet.\n\n85\n00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.486\nSo here it is, it is the /19, for\n\n86\n00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:44.174\na /19 I know that's going to be 225,\n\n87\n00:04:44.174 --> 00:04:47.691\nno 225.2-\n&gt;&gt; No, 255.\n\n88\n00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:48.445\n&gt;&gt; 255.\n\n89\n00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:52.696\nSee, you've got me again, 255.255,\n\n90\n00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:57.596\nI'm not gonna get that right am I,\n.224, right?\n\n91\n00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:58.106\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, cuz it's three bits.\n\n92\n00:04:58.106 --> 00:04:59.012\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's three bits.\n\n93\n00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:01.688\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, three bits, so 224.\n\n94\n00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:04.318\nSo if I take 256 and\n\n95\n00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:10.173\nI subtract out 224 that leaves me with 32.\n\n96\n00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:12.447\nSo I know what my interval is gonna be.\n\n97\n00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:19.750\nNow Daniel, I have a problem here,\nI wanna start counting from 0, 32, 64.\n\n98\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.330\nSo where should I begin with\nnumbers as high as this?\n\n99\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.879\n&gt;&gt; Because we're above 128,\nwe can start with 128.\n\n100\n00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.940\n&gt;&gt; We can start with 128.\n\n101\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.704\nSo if I do that,\nwhat are my network numbers in?\n\n102\n00:05:31.704 --> 00:05:33.940\n128 from that point on.\n\n103\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.147\nAnd then 32 would be 160,\nafter that would 192, after that would be,\n\n104\n00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:44.950\n64 would be 256, no,\n32, that's 224, sorry.\n\n105\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.672\nI forgot, see, numbers start changing now.\n\n106\n00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:50.640\n224 and then 256, we don't need the 256.\n\n107\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.720\nSo now I start to look here and\ngo wait a minute.\n\n108\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.490\nOne of those that we did here,\nhey that looks like the right answer\n\n109\n00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.850\nbecause if I start from 128,\n128, I know that's\n\n110\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.460\nin every single possible network that's\nout there, that that one's gonna appear.\n\n111\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.820\nThat looks right to me.\n\n112\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.480\nDaniel, is that the right answer?\n\n113\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.990\n&gt;&gt; No, that is not the right answer even\nthough it was one of the networks that\n\n114\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.930\nwere valid,\nit's not the right answer because the IP\n\n115\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.370\naddresses that you have given\nus do not fall in that range.\n\n116\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.068\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now this is where\nit's easy to get very quick and\n\n117\n00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:29.110\ngo, crud, I know exactly what it is,\nbut now you have to take a look.\n\n118\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.160\nRemember that we are no longer\njust working in this octet,\n\n119\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.150\nwe are working in this one.\n\n120\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.498\nSo now we have, actually this range, so I\nknow that the c can't be the right answer.\n\n121\n00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:43.751\nD definitely isn't the right answer\nbecause that's even lower, so\n\n122\n00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:46.740\nboth of those are lower so\nI can eliminate those two.\n\n123\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.780\nSo now, Daniel,\nI'm left with a and b here.\n\n124\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.460\nWell one of them doesn't belong\nto this network up here either,\n\n125\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.220\nit's gotta be this one.\n\n126\n00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.795\nThis is lower than, what, the possibility.\n\n127\n00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:05.768\nWe went 128, 160, 192, and\nthat begins with 195, so\n\n128\n00:07:05.768 --> 00:07:09.182\n191, that can't be in that same network.\n\n129\n00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n191 must be on a different network.\n\n130\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.900\n&gt;&gt; Right must be on-\n&gt;&gt; It's not a network ID.\n\n131\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's not even network ID, so\n\n132\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.160\nthis is actually gonna be the answer,\nwhich is right here.\n\n133\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.700\nNow it took us longer than a minute to\nexplain it, but what I'm trying to show\n\n134\n00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.680\nyou at this point in terms of answering,\nand Daniel's logic may work just a little\n\n135\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.930\nbit differently here, but, Daniel, what I\ntried to do is the process of elimination.\n\n136\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.040\nJust very simply, by taking a look at\nthis and starting with what we knew,\n\n137\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.080\nwe knew how to actually arrive at what\nwe needed, then I realized that 160 and\n\n138\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.290\n128 were not actually in the range\nof what we see right here.\n\n139\n00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.827\nSo I immediately eliminated those two and\nnow I had to work with these two.\n\n140\n00:07:51.827 --> 00:07:57.947\nDaniel rightly started realizing that 191\nis not in the 192 network that we went by.\n\n141\n00:07:57.947 --> 00:07:59.498\nSo that leaves us with this.\n\n142\n00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:01.534\nYou can always do that\nprocess of elimination.\n\n143\n00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:03.485\nAt least get it down to two, and\n\n144\n00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:07.840\nthen work with the details to\narrive at the right answer, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.140\nSo Daniel did you see any,\nas you determined it, did that sound good?\n\n146\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really formulatic,\nit's systematic however you wanna put it.\n\n147\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.276\nYou start putting things\nin the right order and\n\n148\n00:08:17.276 --> 00:08:18.620\nyou do it every time that same way.\n\n149\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.580\nAnd as you saw, Ronnie's memorization\nof the 32 table was instrumental for\n\n150\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.820\nhim to be able to answer this\nquestion really, really quickly.\n\n151\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.676\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because if not, I would have\nto start counting bits, and then,\n\n152\n00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:30.914\n[LAUGH] now I'm toast.\n\n153\n00:08:30.914 --> 00:08:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n154\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.872\nmy trick was always just to\ngrab the action octed, or\n\n155\n00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:38.205\nwhaterver, and\nthe subnet mask into the logical.\n\n156\n00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:39.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n157\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.700\n&gt;&gt; With the bits.\n\n158\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.105\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n159\n00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:44.327\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Boom, there's my subnet.\n\n160\n00:08:44.327 --> 00:08:45.830\nBut that is way faster.\n\n161\n00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.060\nI mean, I can do that pretty quickly.\n\n162\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n163\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.560\n&gt;&gt; And if I get stuck,\nI'd probably refer to that.\n\n164\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.940\n&gt;&gt; But see the great thing is,\nyou have the tools to do that.\n\n165\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So because you know how to do that,\n\n166\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.790\neven if you couldn't remember the trick,\nyou're, Fred, let me go ahead and\n\n167\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.430\ndo this quickly, and it works.\n\n168\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter whether you use my\n\n169\n00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.260\nmethod or Daniel's method.\n\n170\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.420\nYou just have to be fast at doing it and\nthat's the key.\n\n171\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.270\nOkay, so we are trying to show you\nthe logic as well as show you some of\n\n172\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.100\nthe types of questions, right.\n\n173\n00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.460\nSo let's move on to the second\nquestion here Daniel as we begin.\n\n174\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.390\nOkay you've assigned 172,\nlook Daniel these high numbers again.\n\n175\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n176\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.090\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna kill me here-\n&gt;&gt; Although you threw a 255 in there.\n\n177\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I did, I threw a 255 in there.\n\n178\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.195\n&gt;&gt; That's a real curve ball.\n\n179\n00:09:25.195 --> 00:09:28.760\n&gt;&gt; 128/26, how many subnets can I create?\n\n180\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.790\nWierd.\n\n181\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:35.878\nDaniel, I don't think I can actually\ncreate the 256 or 400 out of this, can I?\n\n182\n00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:37.670\nIs that possible?\n\n183\n00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Greater than 400, it says-\n&gt;&gt; Greater than 400, is that possible?\n\n184\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.870\nIt looks to me like, man,\nI don't really have great options here.\n\n185\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.390\nI could possibly create four or two,\n\n186\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.790\nbut really with a /26 I should\nbe able to create, four right?\n\n187\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's actually gonna be 192 minus,\n\n188\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.680\nyeah I should be able to\ncreate four networks right?\n\n189\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.960\n&gt;&gt; But, right, the key here I believe\nis we're in a class B network.\n\n190\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.930\nAnd that's, that's what I think\nRonnie's trying to work us around here.\n\n191\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.980\nIf you look at this as a class C,\nwhat Ronnie's saying is right.\n\n192\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.867\nBut since you see that 172.31, you should\nbe going, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\n\n193\n00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:16.614\nClass B, therefore I have\nthe 16 bits to work with on\n\n194\n00:10:16.614 --> 00:10:19.790\nthe other side of that subnet mask.\n\n195\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this is where we now start\nto actually see where class B subnetting\n\n196\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.170\nhelps us out here.\n\n197\n00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.202\nIf not, your mind, because you have been\npracticing class C, class C, class C,\n\n198\n00:10:30.202 --> 00:10:32.610\nclass C, you will look at this and\nthen go.\n\n199\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.589\nWell, the 192 which is what that\naction octet is going to be,\n\n200\n00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:39.728\nokay, that ending octet.\n\n201\n00:10:39.728 --> 00:10:44.515\nThat's actually gonna give\nme that interval of 64, so.\n\n202\n00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:48.133\nBut I don't have 64, but I realize\nthat I can get 64 networks out of, or\n\n203\n00:10:48.133 --> 00:10:51.190\n4 networks excuse me,\nwith using that 64 out of the class C.\n\n204\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.549\nBut the problem is this is class B.\n\n205\n00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:57.358\nSo with a class B and we start doing this,\nnow we have to determine something else,\n\n206\n00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:58.320\nright?\n\n207\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.280\nSo 16, and\nif you add in the extra eight bits here,\n\n208\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.865\nand then an additional two bits.\n\n209\n00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, ten bits.\n\n210\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.830\n&gt;&gt; Two to the tenth power, well that's\ngonna be more than 256 networks.\n\n211\n00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.704\nSo this is gonna be my closest and\nbest answer which is gonna be right here.\n\n212\n00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:17.731\n&gt;&gt; And I love that, Ronnie didn't figure\nout how many networks he could have,\n\n213\n00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:19.400\nhe just realized it was more than 256.\n\n214\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.580\nAnd the only other answer that was\nleft after that was the fourth one,\n\n215\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.420\njust answer the question.\n\n216\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, don´t over-read this question\nand go, all right, let me see,\n\n217\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.070\ntwo to the tenth power,\nnow let me work that out and do that.\n\n218\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.675\nYou can, hopefully by this point-\n&gt;&gt; It´s more than 256.\n\n219\n00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:36.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It´s more than 256.\n\n220\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.820\nBut just kinda realize you\ndon't have to do that.\n\n221\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.420\nIt is about speed,\n\n222\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.212\nhowever you get to the answer is\nokay as long as you're not cheating.\n\n223\n00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:48.266\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I will make the qualifier there.\n\n224\n00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:51.545\nBut just kinda realize\nthat it can be done, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:56.345\nSo using logic like that, paying\nattention to what they ask you is key,\n\n226\n00:11:56.345 --> 00:11:59.195\nokay, when you start to do this.\n\n227\n00:11:59.195 --> 00:12:02.912\nSo this is something that I\ndid in the early days when\n\n228\n00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:05.312\nI first started actually\ntrying to study for this.\n\n229\n00:12:05.312 --> 00:12:10.112\nEvery single time I would actually do the\nentire subnet and subnet all the bits out.\n\n230\n00:12:10.112 --> 00:12:15.262\nAnd then network ID, broadcast ID,\nrange, and do all that every time.\n\n231\n00:12:15.262 --> 00:12:17.035\nOn the exam, you don't have to do that.\n\n232\n00:12:17.035 --> 00:12:19.652\nIt's whatever question\nthat they're asking you,\n\n233\n00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:23.110\nthat's what you have to kind of\nmake sure that you determine, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.660\nSo let's move on up now\nto the third example, and\n\n235\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.090\nnow it's a little bit trickier.\n\n236\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.320\nNotice the answers, Dan.\n\n237\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n238\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.430\n&gt;&gt; We started throwing in a mix of\nanswers, no longer kind of simple.\n\n239\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.990\nNow all of the sudden it's like, crud,\n\n240\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.760\nnow I have to convert these things\nto do what we need to do here, okay.\n\n241\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.731\nSo now let's just pay attention just\na little bit more as we start and\n\n242\n00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.251\nwe'll see a couple of things here, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:52.415\nYou must request a network\nfrom 172300.0/16,\n\n244\n00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:58.860\nthat's supports 50 networks without having\ntoo many extra networks here, okay.\n\n245\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.060\nSo which of the following is\nactually the subnet mask that will\n\n246\n00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.900\ngive you what you need?\n\n247\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.620\nOkay, so that is what we want\nto determine at this point.\n\n248\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.790\nOkay so now if I take a look at something,\n\n249\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:16.600\nI realize something that with\nthe class B network okay.\n\n250\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.520\nI only need 50 additional networks.\n\n251\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.280\nWhile this is where I might have\nto go back and go, all right,\n\n252\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.420\nhow many bits what I have to borrow\nfrom the host side to just give me?\n\n253\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.100\n50 networks, okay,\nis what I would actually do here, okay.\n\n254\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.770\nSo that's what I would need to\ndetermine at that particular point.\n\n255\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.750\nSo when I do something like this,\nDaniel, have you figured out the-\n\n256\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.660\n&gt;&gt; I want to say it's six bits?\n\n257\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that should give you 64 networks.\n\n258\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.300\nIs what it should give you.\n\n259\n00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.100\nSo now when we take something like that,\nright,\n\n260\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.050\nand we talk about six bits here that\nwe're actually adding in from that 16.\n\n261\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:57.340\nSo which of the following here is\nthe additional six bits, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.890\nWell, this is an additional eight\nbits here, so that's not right.\n\n263\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:07.651\nThis is an additional seven\nbits if I remember this, right?\n\n264\n00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:12.980\n23- 16, that should be seven bits.\n\n265\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.559\nAnd this one is 16, 17, yeah actually,\nthat looks like the right\n\n266\n00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:24.251\nanswer right there, okay, as far as\nI can actually tell at this point.\n\n267\n00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:29.190\nBut Daniel, there's also another\ntricky thing right here.\n\n268\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.430\nNotice this one, if I convert that two-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n269\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:40.630\n&gt;&gt; The subnet mask, that subnet mask,\nwe know there's the first bit there.\n\n270\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.220\nSo if I do that 16 and then I do, 22.\n\n271\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.460\nHow many bits is that also?\n\n272\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.240\n&gt;&gt; That is six bits.\n\n273\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.380\n&gt;&gt; That's actually six bits as well.\n\n274\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.350\nSo it could be where it is a trick answer.\n\n275\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.920\nNow, it's not gonna be as\ntricky as me on the exam.\n\n276\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.480\nSo here,\nI wanted to throw that one in there.\n\n277\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.570\nBecause this one it actually is both,\nokay?\n\n278\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.080\nSo you can actually see\nthe answer in either way.\n\n279\n00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.170\nMost of the time with Cisco and\nas far as I can remember.\n\n280\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.345\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It should tell you how many.\n\n281\n00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.799\n[CROSSTALK] Should tell you.\n\n282\n00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:19.760\n&gt;&gt; I can't guarantee that it's gonna\ntell you but it should tell you, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.030\nSo either one but\n\n284\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.250\nusually if you're given both right\n&gt;&gt; And you have the chance to select both,\n\n285\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.080\nyou should see where the question\nactually changes from a radio button\n\n286\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.580\nto one of those little squares that gives\nyou the option to select more than one.\n\n287\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.270\nSo if it does allow you that,\nit should tell you\n\n288\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.660\nchoose all that apply which normally\nCisco doesn't try and make you do.\n\n289\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.306\n&gt;&gt; They try and tell you like, no, you\nshould be able to choose two of these and\n\n290\n00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:45.497\nthey should be the right answer.\n\n291\n00:15:45.497 --> 00:15:50.288\nBut I kind of threw that one in there\nbecause you can't say that every single\n\n292\n00:15:50.288 --> 00:15:54.714\nexam that you'll ever take will be\nthat specific, like Cisco does.\n\n293\n00:15:54.714 --> 00:15:57.978\nBut just kind of realize\nthat you may see this, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:57.978 --> 00:16:04.010\nSo Daniel, any other way that\nyou saw this question as we?\n\n295\n00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.710\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm following right along with you,\nI think.\n\n296\n00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeap, just wanted to make\nsure as we started to do this.\n\n297\n00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.190\nSo here's Daniel's forte here, cuz he's\nthe one that was able to help us out here.\n\n298\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.820\nWhich of the following is\nthe broadcast address?\n\n299\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.059\nRemember, we don't have to\ndetermine everything, right?\n\n300\n00:16:19.059 --> 00:16:23.962\nOkay, I just need to determine\nthe broadcast address,\n\n301\n00:16:23.962 --> 00:16:28.361\nnow the class C address,\nDaniel, with a /29.\n\n302\n00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:32.520\nSo with a /29, how do I\n\n303\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.130\ndo this relatively quickly is what we want\nto actually be able to do here, okay?\n\n304\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.580\nSo when something like\nthis ends up happening,\n\n305\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.330\nokay, what are we actually taking a look\nat at this particular point here, okay?\n\n306\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.125\nSo what we would do, right,\nis we would go ahead and\n\n307\n00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:49.469\ndetermine what the subnet mask is, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:49.469 --> 00:16:57.033\nSo the subnet mask is gonna\nbe 255.255.255.248, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:57.033 --> 00:17:01.218\nThat is what the subnet mask is\ngoing to be, I am dead serious,\n\n310\n00:17:01.218 --> 00:17:03.480\nit's those higher end, right?\n\n311\n00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.940\nThis is why, for me,\na turning point for when I do this,\n\n312\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:16.140\nright, is I know a 16, okay, and a 28,\nI know that those are actually 240, right?\n\n313\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.054\nSo then the next number up from\nthat is always gonna be 248.\n\n314\n00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.010\nFor me, a /28 is 240, so I know that\nthe subnet mask is gonna be 248.\n\n315\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.244\nIf I subtract that from 256, so\n\n316\n00:17:29.244 --> 00:17:34.358\n256 minus 248, that should be 8.\n\n317\n00:17:34.358 --> 00:17:40.370\nSo that is my interval of 8 at that point,\nis what we start to take a look at.\n\n318\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.440\nAnd now I start to see\nsomething right here, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.315\nWith the given address,\nI know that more than likely then,\n\n320\n00:17:48.315 --> 00:17:52.125\nthat if I start doing this,\nI know that 8 times 8 is 64.\n\n321\n00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:56.325\nSo my network ID is what, 64, okay, so\n\n322\n00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:59.552\nif we start to take a look here-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n323\n00:17:59.552 --> 00:18:01.953\nthat's actually the first\nIP address in that range.\n\n324\n00:18:01.953 --> 00:18:05.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's pretty much\nthe first IP address in that range.\n\n325\n00:18:05.726 --> 00:18:08.827\nSo Daniel,\nwhen we start to take a look, then,\n\n326\n00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:14.020\nwhat is the possible of that IP address,\nokay, as we start going on here?\n\n327\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:19.785\nIf this is the 12/65,\nI know that the 12 is gonna be the same,\n\n328\n00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:24.325\nso what would actually be its next-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the next IP or\n\n329\n00:18:24.325 --> 00:18:30.090\nthe next network range would be 64 and\n64, 128, so minus that would be 120.\n\n330\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.760\nThat would be the broadcast range, so 129.\n\n331\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.150\n&gt;&gt; 129, okay, so now, well, wait.\n\n332\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.531\n&gt;&gt; You don't have it, there.\n\n333\n00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:40.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I typed it in wrong.\n\n334\n00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.018\n&gt;&gt; You typed 255 [LAUGH].\n\n335\n00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:43.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I did type it in wrong,\nI was like, where did it go?\n\n336\n00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.553\nBut you are right, all right, so\nwe've gotta make a, how do I do that?\n\n337\n00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:52.334\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with it.\n\n338\n00:18:52.334 --> 00:18:55.747\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's fix it.\n\n339\n00:18:55.747 --> 00:18:59.150\n&gt;&gt; I just started typing in the address,\nlike, this will be fine here.\n\n340\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.224\n&gt;&gt; You could write,\nnone of the above [LAUGH].\n\n341\n00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:04.173\n&gt;&gt; I should've wrote none of the above,\nbut there we go, so let's go ahead and\n\n342\n00:19:04.173 --> 00:19:05.110\ndo that instead.\n\n343\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.486\nSo Daniel, that was me just typing and\ngiving the wrong answer, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:08.486 --> 00:19:12.397\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what, I actually\ncame to the answer quicker than that.\n\n345\n00:19:12.397 --> 00:19:16.666\nI knew it wasn't any of the others\nbecause it's a class C address,\n\n346\n00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:18.660\nwe're not gonna go past 12.\n\n347\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.870\n12 is part of the network ID,\nand as we saw,\n\n348\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.120\nwe typically chop of anything that\nwould roll over to the next thing.\n\n349\n00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.577\nSo it had to be that even\nthough the answer was 255,\n\n350\n00:19:27.577 --> 00:19:31.159\nI knew that Ronnie just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; I just realized something Daniel,\n\n351\n00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:34.315\nit should be 127 since\nthe next network is 128.\n\n352\n00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:37.069\nSo not only did I type it in wrong,\nwe guessed at it.\n\n353\n00:19:37.069 --> 00:19:39.864\n&gt;&gt; All this in your head stuff,\nthis is why they give you scratch paper.\n\n354\n00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:42.153\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's why you should pay attention here,\n\n355\n00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:44.755\ncuz I at least typed in that\nquestion wrong, which was silly.\n\n356\n00:19:44.755 --> 00:19:47.105\nBut I was looking at it, I was like,\nI know that the answer, no,\n\n357\n00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:49.335\napparently I didn't type\nin the right answer.\n\n358\n00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:51.575\nBut just kinda realize that\nthat's something simple.\n\n359\n00:19:51.575 --> 00:19:54.607\nThe great thing is, we didn't have\nto determine the rest of it, right?\n\n360\n00:19:54.607 --> 00:19:58.387\nWe just had to figure out what that\naddress was, and once we did that and\n\n361\n00:19:58.387 --> 00:20:00.549\nwe realized what that was,\nthen we can go on.\n\n362\n00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:04.327\nSo let's take a look at this one\ndown here, which is number five.\n\n363\n00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:08.147\nAnd notice, make sure you remember,\nchoose two, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.170\nWhich of the following are valid\nIP addresses for hosts?\n\n365\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.755\nOkay, now that should tell\nus something right away,\n\n366\n00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:18.330\njust the way that the question is, right?\n\n367\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.801\nWe know that there's special\naddresses that we can't use, okay.\n\n368\n00:20:21.801 --> 00:20:26.100\nSo of course that means there's broadcast\nand the network ID that we can't use.\n\n369\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.916\nAnd, of course,\nthe other addresses that we can't use,\n\n370\n00:20:28.916 --> 00:20:32.950\nwe haven't actually mentioned it at all,\nwhich is gonna be the loopback address.\n\n371\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.364\nWe can't assign that to anything,\nbut the great thing is,\n\n372\n00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:37.990\n127 network doesn't appear,\nso I know it's not loopback.\n\n373\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.659\n&gt;&gt; So it's not that, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n374\n00:20:39.659 --> 00:20:43.079\n&gt;&gt; So there's a possibility\nin these four addresses,\n\n375\n00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:47.288\nI'm gonna find a broadcast ID,\nor I'm gonna find a network ID.\n\n376\n00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:52.029\n&gt;&gt; And quick tip when it comes to exams,\nalmost guarantee, looking at the answers,\n\n377\n00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:55.327\nalmost guarantee one of them\nis a broadcast address, and\n\n378\n00:20:55.327 --> 00:20:57.407\nthe other one is a network address.\n\n379\n00:20:57.407 --> 00:21:00.020\nWe haveto figure out which one is which.\n\n380\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.924\n&gt;&gt; Or not, so this is where it comes in\nand helps you out, if you know a little\n\n381\n00:21:03.924 --> 00:21:07.750\nbit of that memorization that\nwe were talking about as well.\n\n382\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.960\nSo if I know, for me,\nI kind of think about it,\n\n383\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.060\nI know the /23 here,\nI know exactly what that means, okay.\n\n384\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:21.001\nSo for me, that's gonna be a subnet\nmask of 255.255.254, okay.\n\n385\n00:21:21.001 --> 00:21:26.190\nThe great thing is, I know that a class\nC by default is what, 255.255.255.\n\n386\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.950\nThat gives me 254 hosts on a class C.\n\n387\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:36.900\nSo if I take away one more, okay,\nI just double that, and that's 512.\n\n388\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.120\nSo now I just have to have to\nactually come up with the range.\n\n389\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.250\nSo the first thing that I realized is\nthat if I take a look at this one, okay.\n\n390\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:52.940\nThis is actually going to be my\nnetwork ID, okay, for that range.\n\n391\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.911\nNow, if I end that 1.255, okay,\n\n392\n00:21:55.911 --> 00:22:01.861\nthat is actually not the end of a /23,\nbecause that would actually be what?\n\n393\n00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:05.502\nAt the end, which is 254, right,\nthat's exactly where I would be.\n\n394\n00:22:05.502 --> 00:22:09.390\nSo a /23, this is actually just\na valid host at this point.\n\n395\n00:22:11.652 --> 00:22:12.659\n&gt;&gt; So we found one.\n\n396\n00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:15.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we found one,\nso that's actually good.\n\n397\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.740\nNow, the other one though,\nDaniel, this looks strange here.\n\n398\n00:22:20.765 --> 00:22:23.265\n0, that's gotta be another network ID.\n\n399\n00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:24.329\n&gt;&gt; No\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n400\n00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:27.883\n&gt;&gt; No, and\nbecause it falls within that range,\n\n401\n00:22:27.883 --> 00:22:32.417\nbecause the broadcast ID\nis going to be that 2.255.\n\n402\n00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:37.245\nTherefore 2.0 is just an IP address,\nand it can really scramble your brain\n\n403\n00:22:37.245 --> 00:22:41.770\ncuz you're so used to seeing\n.0s being network addresses.\n\n404\n00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.710\nBut don't fall for that trap, especially\nwhen you know that that is a class B or\n\n405\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.160\nclass A network when you start\nseeing that kind of stuff.\n\n406\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.606\nIt's rare to see a class C within\n.0 that's not a host address.\n\n407\n00:22:52.606 --> 00:22:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is strange,\nI have seen it, which is weird, right?\n\n408\n00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.490\nWhen it appears, you're like,\nno, that can't, yeah, I forgot,\n\n409\n00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.479\nwe did end up actually kind\nof doing a larger subnet.\n\n410\n00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:08.376\nSo when you do see it, like in networking\nyou should be like, wait a minute, that's,\n\n411\n00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:09.675\nno, okay, never mind.\n\n412\n00:23:09.675 --> 00:23:14.022\nIt does remind you that, but\nthat is an actual valid host,\n\n413\n00:23:14.022 --> 00:23:18.903\nbecause that is right smack dab in\nthe middle of the entire range,\n\n414\n00:23:18.903 --> 00:23:25.065\nwhich is 172.16.1.1 all the way through,\n172.16.2.55.\n\n415\n00:23:25.065 --> 00:23:28.224\nNow it gives you the 510 hosts, and\n\n416\n00:23:28.224 --> 00:23:33.510\nthis one right here is smack dab\nin the middle of that range.\n\n417\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.310\nSo it doesn't look valid, and\n\n418\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.630\nthat's something else you have to pay\nattention to, because it shows what?\n\n419\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.110\nDo you understand the concept of this\nsubnetting or not, especially for\n\n420\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.060\nclass B subnetting?\n\n421\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.331\nAnd it's very important that\nwe get that concept in too.\n\n422\n00:23:49.331 --> 00:23:52.248\nAll that's actually possible cuz now\nyou're actually starting to show\n\n423\n00:23:52.248 --> 00:23:52.785\nyour skill.\n\n424\n00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:54.107\nDo you know that that's valid, or\n\n425\n00:23:54.107 --> 00:23:56.673\ndo you actually still think that\nthat's considered a network ID?\n\n426\n00:23:56.673 --> 00:24:01.670\nAnd if you're not sure, this is\nwhere we break out the binary again.\n\n427\n00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.346\nAnd we go, wait a minute, let me check.\n\n428\n00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:07.233\nAre all my host bits actually\ngoing to be 0s here, okay?\n\n429\n00:24:07.233 --> 00:24:09.621\nWhen I do this, and\nyou're gonna end up finding out,\n\n430\n00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:11.330\nit's not gonna actually be that way.\n\n431\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.490\nSo just realize that as you\ndo something like this,\n\n432\n00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.207\nthis is what's gonna end up happening.\n\n433\n00:24:15.207 --> 00:24:17.243\nSo that is another one that we have.\n\n434\n00:24:17.243 --> 00:24:20.539\nAll right, Daniel, looks like we have\ntime for one more at least here.\n\n435\n00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:23.448\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n436\n00:24:23.448 --> 00:24:26.598\nSo what are the next two\nvalid subnets after,\n\n437\n00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:29.526\nthere's those high numbers again, Daniel.\n\n438\n00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:30.484\n&gt;&gt; You're killing me.\n\n439\n00:24:30.484 --> 00:24:36.833\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so now, 192.168.32.144, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:39.528\nSo Daniel,\nthey're not asking for just one.\n\n441\n00:24:39.528 --> 00:24:42.053\nThey're asking for\nthe next two valid subnets here, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:42.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n443\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.547\n&gt;&gt; So now that we've learned\nour method of what we need,\n\n444\n00:24:46.547 --> 00:24:53.025\nwe know that a /28 means that 4th octet,\nthe action octet is gonna be a 240, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:56.261\nBut what is my network interval\nIf I subtract that from 256?\n\n446\n00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:57.069\n&gt;&gt; 16.\n\n447\n00:24:57.069 --> 00:24:58.252\n&gt;&gt; 16, okay?\n\n448\n00:24:58.252 --> 00:25:01.117\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now that we have that,\n\n449\n00:25:01.117 --> 00:25:04.342\nright, so look at this number.\n\n450\n00:25:04.342 --> 00:25:07.941\nThat's above 128, which means that\nI’m gonna start counting from 16-\n\n451\n00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:08.524\n&gt;&gt; From 128.\n\n452\n00:25:08.524 --> 00:25:09.283\n&gt;&gt; From 128.\n\n453\n00:25:09.283 --> 00:25:13.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which 128, 144,\n\n454\n00:25:13.181 --> 00:25:17.159\nafter that would be 160.\n\n455\n00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:20.429\nSo I know by just looking at that then,\n\n456\n00:25:20.429 --> 00:25:24.429\nthat this is gonna be the valid subnet,\nokay?\n\n457\n00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:28.516\nSo what network is after 160\nif we do an interval of 16?\n\n458\n00:25:28.516 --> 00:25:31.742\n160 plus 16 is actually gonna be-\n&gt;&gt; 176, yeah.\n\n459\n00:25:31.742 --> 00:25:38.850\n&gt;&gt; 176, All right?\n\n460\n00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:42.420\nSo there it is, we're starting to see\nwhere we're being able to move a little\n\n461\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.750\nbit faster here using the same\ntechniques that we've already shown you\n\n462\n00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.920\njust to take a little bit of point\nin time to be able to do this, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.660\nNow, do remember, cuz we are now\nrunning out of time to do this.\n\n464\n00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.759\nNow, notice I didn't even pay\nattention to the other ones.\n\n465\n00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:58.007\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n466\n00:25:58.007 --> 00:26:01.914\nThat's a part of you\ngetting faster as well.\n\n467\n00:26:01.914 --> 00:26:04.852\nSaying look, I know what I need determine,\nwhat if you look down and go,\n\n468\n00:26:04.852 --> 00:26:07.222\nI know what the answer is,\ndon't worry about doing this.\n\n469\n00:26:07.222 --> 00:26:08.032\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You go-\n\n470\n00:26:08.032 --> 00:26:09.783\n&gt;&gt; Just answer it, answer it.\n\n471\n00:26:09.783 --> 00:26:15.032\n&gt;&gt; Don't even, well, Ronnie says I got, no\nyou don't, we're explaining this, right?\n\n472\n00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:18.185\nBut if you can go through it in your\nhead and you know what the answer is,\n\n473\n00:26:18.185 --> 00:26:18.889\nthat's cool.\n\n474\n00:26:18.889 --> 00:26:21.338\nAnd yeah, I'm not gonna count\nany points against you and go.\n\n475\n00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:23.817\nHeck, even if you guess and\nyou get it right, you're fine.\n\n476\n00:26:23.817 --> 00:26:25.338\nBut I'd rather you not guess and\n\n477\n00:26:25.338 --> 00:26:29.510\nactually use the skills that you actually\nlearned right here to help you out.\n\n478\n00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.645\nNow there's a few more questions\nthat we have right here to follow.\n\n479\n00:26:33.645 --> 00:26:36.661\nBut they're pretty much in the same\npattern we've been doing, okay?\n\n480\n00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:39.919\nTake a look at every question and\nessentially walking through the logic.\n\n481\n00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:41.641\n&gt;&gt; And it's good for\nus not to answer them for you.\n\n482\n00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:44.161\nJust go ahead and give them a shot,\nthey'll be in the show notes.\n\n483\n00:26:44.161 --> 00:26:45.775\nAnd see what you can do.\n\n484\n00:26:45.775 --> 00:26:50.799\nActually in the chat room, we had a\nsubnetting.net subnetting-apx, and there's\n\n485\n00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:55.348\na place in subnetting.net where you can\ngo and do some practice stuff there.\n\n486\n00:26:55.348 --> 00:26:56.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's all good stuff.\n\n487\n00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.080\nAnywhere you can find some practice for\nsubnetting, do it.\n\n488\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.290\nGet good at this.\n\n489\n00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.626\nIt's going to take that practice, so\n\n490\n00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:05.331\nhammer away at it until\nit is second nature.\n\n491\n00:27:05.331 --> 00:27:06.675\nAnd then go hammer it out on the exam.\n\n492\n00:27:06.675 --> 00:27:07.283\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n493\n00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:09.145\nanything else you wanna add before we go?\n\n494\n00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:09.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\n\n495\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.910\nwe'll have the complete list of\nquestions that I'll have here.\n\n496\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.770\nThat will also be part of the notes,\ntake time to work through them, but\n\n497\n00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:21.042\nmake sure you take a look at the different\ntypes of questions that are out there.\n\n498\n00:27:21.042 --> 00:27:23.480\nSo there's a few more, like we said,\nwe're gonna leave those for\n\n499\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.550\nyou to kind of handle on your own,\nbut don't be afraid to try,\n\n500\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.120\ndon't be afraid to actually go faster and\nmake sure that you can do this.\n\n501\n00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.907\nYou may end up finding out something\nas you do this more and more,\n\n502\n00:27:33.907 --> 00:27:37.621\nwhich is there's probably faster ways than\neven what Todd Langley can do, which is,\n\n503\n00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:38.414\nto me, amazing.\n\n504\n00:27:38.414 --> 00:27:41.677\nBut you might come up with a way where\nyou're like, no, this is the way to go.\n\n505\n00:27:41.677 --> 00:27:43.523\nYou're not gonna hurt\nmy feelings if you go,\n\n506\n00:27:43.523 --> 00:27:45.668\nRonnie does not know how\nto teach subnetting at all.\n\n507\n00:27:45.668 --> 00:27:49.304\n&gt;&gt; Actually, email us at\nronnieanddaniel@itpro.tv [LAUGH].\n\n508\n00:27:49.304 --> 00:27:52.310\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you gotta go,\nyou really can't do that ever again.\n\n509\n00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.560\nYou shouldn't, but\njust kind of pay attention there.\n\n510\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.761\nBecause this is a key part of the exam.\n\n511\n00:27:56.761 --> 00:28:02.106\nYou're not only facing this for\nCCENT, CCNA routing and switching.\n\n512\n00:28:02.106 --> 00:28:05.472\nBut those of you heading on to CCNP.\n\n513\n00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:06.408\n&gt;&gt; CCIE.\n\n514\n00:28:06.408 --> 00:28:07.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, CCIE.\n\n515\n00:28:07.433 --> 00:28:08.649\nYou're just gonna have to know this.\n\n516\n00:28:08.649 --> 00:28:10.083\nAnd they'll not even ask you questions.\n\n517\n00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.271\nThey're just gonna say, configure\nthis with the proper networks and\n\n518\n00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:14.660\nmake sure that they work, and they're\njust gonna give you a network range.\n\n519\n00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:22.040\nOr, you know, like here it is, you need\n400 networks that support this many hosts.\n\n520\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.390\nAnd you're just gonna have to go,\nokay, and just do it, okay?\n\n521\n00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.131\nSo that's some of the stuff that you'll\njust have to be able to configure and do,\n\n522\n00:28:30.131 --> 00:28:31.680\nand do it quickly as well.\n\n523\n00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.030\nSo Daniel, I think that's\nactually a good practice for\n\n524\n00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.650\nwhat we have available at this\nparticular point in time.\n\n525\n00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.584\nAs our show continues to progress on,\nwe'll end up doing maybe another one at\n\n526\n00:28:41.584 --> 00:28:44.686\nsome point in the future,\ncuz it's always a good reminder.\n\n527\n00:28:44.686 --> 00:28:47.553\nBut at least for now,\nthat should get us on the right track.\n\n528\n00:28:47.553 --> 00:28:51.440\nSo continue to practice and\nyou will master this very soon.\n\n529\n00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, thanks so much for\njoining us today and helping us try our\n\n530\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.900\nsubnetting knowledge and see how well\nwe can do and how fast we can get.\n\n531\n00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.886\nThat's what it's all about, it's all about\nthat speed when it comes to this exam.\n\n532\n00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:04.865\nThank you, good folks out there for\nwatching, but like Ronnie said,\n\n533\n00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:08.112\nwe're out of time for this episode,\nso we're gonna call it for ITPro.TV.\n\n534\n00:29:08.112 --> 00:29:09.396\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n535\n00:29:09.396 --> 00:29:10.196\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n536\n00:29:10.196 --> 00:29:12.083\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n537\n00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:18.496\n[MUSIC]\n\n538\n00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:21.504\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.392\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:09.441\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:14.810\nWelcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.360\nYou're watching the actual\nCisco CCENT show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.338\nWe are now ready to start practicing\na little bit of sub netting.\n\n8\n00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:26.330\nAnd I'm gonna be your host as well as the\nguy presenting the information to you and\n\n9\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.450\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.100\nNow, we've already done a part one to\nthis, and I had Daniel joining me then.\n\n11\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.582\nBut today, though, we're actually just\ncompleting the rest of the different\n\n12\n00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:37.840\nsub netting types of questions that\nyou're normally gonna end up finding.\n\n13\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.350\nAnd just about any exam\nregardless whether Cisco or not.\n\n14\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.849\nSo we wanted to round out this and just\nshow you a few more questions here and\n\n15\n00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:47.454\nthat's what we're gonna\njump into right now, okay?\n\n16\n00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:51.510\nSo, let's just go ahead and dive in and\nwe'll see how far we get on this one.\n\n17\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.820\nSo in the first episode, we did take\nabout six of those questions and\n\n18\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.940\nwe ran through them.\n\n19\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.820\nWe talk about the logic behind them,\n\n20\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.330\nmaking sure that you understood\nthe way that they would come at you.\n\n21\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.740\nNow, these are by far maybe not the only\ntypes of question that you'll see but\n\n22\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.710\nthey're generically the types that you'll\nhave to answer prior just about in every\n\n23\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.870\nsingle exam if you ever face sub\nnetting questions as well, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.229\nSo let's start off with\nquestion number 7 here.\n\n25\n00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.132\nAnd let's make sure we point out some of\nthe elements as we do this, all right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:22.280\nSo, as we take a look here at part 7.\n\n27\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.500\nI'm trying to see if we can zoom in\na little bit better to help us out.\n\n28\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.074\nThere we go, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:35.850\nYou need to create 2 point-to-point\nnetworks from 192.168.177.0, with a /24.\n\n30\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.770\nWhich ones would you give\nthat you would require?\n\n31\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.780\nExcuse me, sorry, that's my exactly here.\n\n32\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.550\nWhich one would you give that meets\nthe requirements, I should say, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.554\nSo, as we take a look at this,\nwould meet the given requirements.\n\n34\n00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:56.905\nMeet the requirements.\n\n35\n00:01:56.905 --> 00:02:00.950\nSorry my,\n[LAUGH] my particular syntax is terrible.\n\n36\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.780\nAll right, now when we take a look at,\n\n37\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.890\nthe key here is to understand\nthis point right here, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.430\nWhat does it mean to have\na point-to-point network?\n\n39\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.130\nWhen we talk about the idea\nof point-to-point network,\n\n40\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.980\nthis is not something that\nI've started using through\n\n41\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.202\nthe episodes here on sub\nnetting as we did that, right?\n\n42\n00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.280\nA point-to-point network is\nessentially a network that has,\n\n43\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.040\nwell, two IP addresses that\nare valid IP addresses for a host.\n\n44\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.530\nSo, when we start to do something like\nthat, right, we know that every single\n\n45\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.010\nnetwork is gonna end up having\na network ID and a broadcast address.\n\n46\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.340\nSo, for us to have an additional two for\nhost that we need,\n\n47\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.680\nthat means it's gonna have\na maximum of four addresses.\n\n48\n00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.640\nNow, if we start taking a look at that,\nthat now means that I need to be able to\n\n49\n00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.342\nknow what the subnet is, that essentially\ngives me those four addresses.\n\n50\n00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:52.457\nFor me,\nthat subnet is gonna end up being a /30.\n\n51\n00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:59.214\nThat's gonna be a 255.255.255.252.\n\n52\n00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:02.085\nSo not exactly the entire 32 bits there,\nbut\n\n53\n00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:05.630\nit's backed off a couple,\nthat's what it did, right?\n\n54\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.082\nSo, that's what we'll take a look at.\n\n55\n00:03:08.082 --> 00:03:13.277\nNow, Cisco has this habit as saying, all\nright, so you know what a point-to-point\n\n56\n00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:18.632\nnetwork is, and that's fine, but\ncan you also put in the context of this.\n\n57\n00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:23.590\nA single network that has a 24 bits for\nthe network portion.\n\n58\n00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.820\nSo at this point,\nwhat are they trying to do?\n\n59\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.880\nWell, they like this idea,\nbecause normally you and\n\n60\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.200\nI will actually start off from what,\nzero, right?\n\n61\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.280\nSo, if I start it off, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.560\nI know the interval that I\nneed four of these addresses.\n\n63\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.430\n04A12, etc., as you continue to go up.\n\n64\n00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.760\nBut notice where they started\noff the numberings here, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.650\nSo this is what you want to pay\nattention to as the numbering get you\n\n66\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.860\nas you start to take a look and\nyou get to this point.\n\n67\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.820\nAll right, so how do I actually begin if I\nwanted to start this and figure this out?\n\n68\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.670\nWell, we've already learned from\nthe subnetting episodes that\n\n69\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.540\nevery single subnet itself in\nterms of the intervals, right,\n\n70\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.130\nas we started doing it,\nwe showed you how to do these.\n\n71\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.966\nFrom every single one, that if it's\na number that's higher than 128,\n\n72\n00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:18.648\nwe can begin counting at 128 instead\nbecause that is a subnet that is in\n\n73\n00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:21.435\nevery single subnet that you end up doing.\n\n74\n00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:26.919\nSo if I don't know how to actually do\nthis from 04A12, I start off with 128 and\n\n75\n00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.880\nthen from that point, I go to 132,\n132 to 136, 136 to 140.\n\n76\n00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.230\nAs soon as I actually realized that,\n\n77\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.840\nthat maybe a potential candidate for\nme that I know that's it gonna be 140.\n\n78\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.520\nWell, what's follow up from that?\n\n79\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.560\nWell, that can't be 142, but\nthe next one here though,\n\n80\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.570\nit could be, which is 144, what about 146?\n\n81\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.040\nNope, the next one is gonna be 148.\n\n82\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.550\nSo that is one way that\nyou can tackle this, too.\n\n83\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.490\nSo, trying to show you the logic in\nwhich I might actually apply this,\n\n84\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.700\nif I needed to be able to do this.\n\n85\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.380\nNow, when you start practicing subnetting\nand you start doing this more and\n\n86\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.440\nmore often,\nyou might be able to spot it very quickly.\n\n87\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.170\nSo, you don't have to go through that, but\n\n88\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.840\nwe're at least explaining the logic behind\nhow something like this would work.\n\n89\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.100\nSo, if you spotted it right away,\nkudos to you and you're doing a great job.\n\n90\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.510\nIf you're needing a hint or\na practice, do it the way that I did.\n\n91\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.530\nOnce you get those numbers above 128,\nstart counting at 128.\n\n92\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.220\nIf you realize that the network interval\nhere is gonna be 8, count by 8 from 128.\n\n93\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.840\nIf it's going to be 16,\ncount by 16 from 128 if you need to.\n\n94\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.430\nBut I like using those high numbers\nbecause most of us kind of don't do that,\n\n95\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.030\nstart in the middle of something and\ntry and figure it out.\n\n96\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.620\nAll right,\nlet's move on to number 8 here, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.410\nSo, as we start to take\na look here at number 8,\n\n98\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.410\nwhich of the following are NetworkIDs?\n\n99\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.670\nSo let's make sure that we understand\nthe concept of NetworkIDs and\n\n100\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.718\nmake sure you read the question clearly,\nokay?\n\n101\n00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:06.670\nThere's three ways that they can get\nyou even on a question like this.\n\n102\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.880\nThey might ask you about, which of\nthe following is a network host, right?\n\n103\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.550\nSo remember that that's actually\nindividual devices within the subnet.\n\n104\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.280\nThey can ask you about\nthe broadcasts as well and\n\n105\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.090\nthey can ask you about the idea of IDs.\n\n106\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.370\nThe NetworkID, if you remember correctly,\nor the network number itself, right?\n\n107\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.800\nIs the one where all of the host bits that\n\n108\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.400\nare available in my subnet,\nthat they're all zeros.\n\n109\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.610\nBut the problem that you have is that you\nonly have a minute per question to be able\n\n110\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.681\nto do something like this.\n\n111\n00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:40.720\nIf you only have a minute per question\nto do this, you can't take the time to\n\n112\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.500\nessentially change all\nof these into binary and\n\n113\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.535\nthen go, okay,\nwhich portion is the host portion?\n\n114\n00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:51.510\nBut, you have to be able to kind of\nspot a couple of different things.\n\n115\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.389\nThe first thing, of course, is take a look\nat the subnet mask that you have, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.742\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and go,\nhey, I know what the subnet mask is,\n\n117\n00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:04.887\nits 255.255.255.192.\n\n118\n00:07:04.887 --> 00:07:06.618\nWell, how do I know it's 192?\n\n119\n00:07:06.618 --> 00:07:11.447\nBecause the first three gives me 24\nbits and then if I do slash 25, well,\n\n120\n00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:17.050\nthat's going to be a 128, then I'm gonna\ndo a slash 26, that's gonna be 192.\n\n121\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.930\nSo now I have my network interval at\nthat point which is gonna be 64, right?\n\n122\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.690\nSo if I do 64 at this point,\nlet me go ahead and take a look.\n\n123\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.270\nLook at that, they gave me 128.\n\n124\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:35.560\nWell, what is the next network up from\n128 that is actually an interval of 64?\n\n125\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.110\nWell, that would be 192.\n\n126\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.570\nSo I know which one it's not going to be.\n\n127\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.970\nIt's not gonna be b here, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.020\nWell, what about this 0 here?\n\n129\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.190\nWell, that is possibly a NetworkID, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.070\nSo it is very possible that\nthat is a NetworkID, as well.\n\n131\n00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.580\nAnd this one is also a possibility, too.\n\n132\n00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.090\nNow, the problem that I have with the 64,\nright?\n\n133\n00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:05.585\n128 and the next network is 192, well,\nI have to go a little bit further.\n\n134\n00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:10.270\nWell, what is 64 up from 192?\n\n135\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.585\nWell, I hate to say it.\n\n136\n00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:16.760\nFrom 192 to get to 224,\nthat's only 32 instead.\n\n137\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.068\nSo, at this point, what you'd have to\nactually be able to understand and\n\n138\n00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:25.640\ndo here is to realize that it's\ngonna be these two as well, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.360\nSo with this /26 it makes sense here,\nokay?\n\n140\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.160\nBut now with the /23, well,\n\n141\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.900\nthat's one more that actually gets\ninto the Class B network here.\n\n142\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.429\nIt gives me one Class B network but\nwith 512 hosts.\n\n143\n00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:45.479\nAnd so, the range for\nthis one goes from 172.16.1.0,\n\n144\n00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:50.101\nall the way through 172.16.2.254.\n\n145\n00:08:50.101 --> 00:08:54.920\nSo, make sure you review that as you\nstart to continue to study, as well.\n\n146\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.500\nAnd so, don't be tripped up by saying, hey\nlook, I recognize that there is a pattern.\n\n147\n00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.820\nWell, we already recognized those numbers,\n\n148\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.480\nmake sure you also pay attention\nto the subnet mask itself or\n\n149\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.240\nyou're gonna get thrown off by that,\nthe speed and accuracy is the key.\n\n150\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.230\nAll right, now,\nlet's take a look at 9, here, okay?\n\n151\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.020\nWhich of the following\nis a valid subnet mask?\n\n152\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.460\nAnd now I have it listed as choose 2.\n\n153\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.600\nMost of the time,\nespecially on Cisco exams,\n\n154\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.870\nand even on CompTIA exams, they're not\ngonna try and make you guess a ton of them\n\n155\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.540\nbecause they realize they have\na limited number of time.\n\n156\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.780\nSo they're gonna say, tell me which of\nthe two are actually gonna be valid.\n\n157\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.530\nWell, this is where you have\nto be able to distinguish\n\n158\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.770\nwhether it's a subnet mask or not.\n\n159\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.910\nRemember that the easiest to do that is\nthat a subnet mask in binary term, right?\n\n160\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.920\nIs always a contiguous string of zeros\nfrom the left hand, the farthest or\n\n161\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.770\nthe most significant bit all\nthe way to the right hand side,\n\n162\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.622\nthe least significant bit.\n\n163\n00:09:51.622 --> 00:09:56.000\nAnd if that is actually what is happening\nwhen you're taking look at this, right?\n\n164\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.220\nThat means that there\ncannot be any drops at all.\n\n165\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.127\nNo zeroes in between that.\n\n166\n00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:03.967\nSo if I were to take a look\nat this first one here, well,\n\n167\n00:10:03.967 --> 00:10:09.142\nthat starts off with eight bits in a row\nbut, then this is actually is six bits and\n\n168\n00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:13.020\ntwo zeroes and\nthis is eight bits in a row again.\n\n169\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.410\nWell, that one absolutely\nhas eliminated itself.\n\n170\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.930\nI know this one just because it's a Class\nC default, which is perfectly fine.\n\n171\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.690\nNow, it looks like b, c, and d,\n\n172\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.660\nwell, they're all contiguous strings,\nis what we actually have here, too, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.780\nSo this third octet here is five ones and\nthree zeroes in the third octet.\n\n174\n00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.250\nAnd this one doesn't\nhave any of them at all.\n\n175\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.510\nSo now it comes down to\nthe term valid subnet mask.\n\n176\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.290\nWell, technically, this is not\na valid subnet mask or a subnet.\n\n177\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.568\nThis is what we call a host subnet mask,\nis what this one is called.\n\n178\n00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:54.760\nSo we wanna pick two of them,\nwhat we would do is actually find\n\n179\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.260\nthose two that are actually\nvalid in this point, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.150\nSo the last one, is it a subnet mask?\n\n181\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.750\nYes, but is it a valid one for a network?\n\n182\n00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.180\nProbably not, okay?\n\n183\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.080\nSo that now leads us to\nthe final one that we have.\n\n184\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.040\nSo the key here, of course, is to be quick\nand to, again, be accurate about this.\n\n185\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.220\nWhich of the following mask corresponds,\n\n186\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.750\nat least I hope I spell that right,\nto a /22?\n\n187\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.040\nWell, that means that what\nyou're taking a look at here is,\n\n188\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.700\nwell, which one is it that actually\nshows me 22 bits in a row?\n\n189\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.580\nYou might be able to take\nthe time to write out 22 ones\n\n190\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.680\nin terms of binary in a row.\n\n191\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.360\nAnd then, just look at that last\noctet that you need to, and\n\n192\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.750\nfigure out what that number would\nconvert to to help you out.\n\n193\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.280\nSo, if you start off with something like\nthat, you'd have to actually go, wait,\n\n194\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.090\nthat's 24 bits,\nI know that went from a Class C.\n\n195\n00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.880\nSo, that one's out of the question,\nthat one doesn't actually do that.\n\n196\n00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.250\nSo, eliminate that one from your mind,\nokay?\n\n197\n00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.760\nWell, what about this one?\n\n198\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.400\nOkay, if I do something like this one,\nfirst 16, and\n\n199\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.280\nthen I start realizing that\nthis window is 240 here.\n\n200\n00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.150\nWell, that would actually be four one so\nthat's 16 plus 4, that's 20.\n\n201\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.250\nSo I can eliminate d.\n\n202\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.600\nSo that leaves me with b and c here, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.490\nSo from this point,\nthis is what you'll have to do.\n\n204\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.960\nYou'll have to make a decision on which\none you think is the most likely guess.\n\n205\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.934\nNow the other way that you can do that,\n\n206\n00:12:18.934 --> 00:12:23.332\ninstead of doing the whole thing is just\nconcentrate on the third octet here, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:23.332 --> 00:12:26.359\nSo this is from you doing\nthe binary math in the head and\n\n208\n00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:28.456\nrealizing what's happening here.\n\n209\n00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:36.500\nA 252 is going to be, well,\nsix ones and two zeros.\n\n210\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.725\nAnd then the 248 is going to\nbe five ones and three zeros.\n\n211\n00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:45.420\nWell, if I take a look at that and\nI realize something like that, well,\n\n212\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:51.480\nthat means 16 and 16 plus 6,\nthat sounds like 22 to me.\n\n213\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.470\nAnd that is a /22, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.760\nSo, that is something\nelse that you can also do\n\n215\n00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.020\nto help you out to be able to do this,\nokay?\n\n216\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:07.440\nNow, that kind of ends our little bit of\nsubnetting review for what you have, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.790\nBut do not stop with this review and\n\n218\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.950\nthink I've got this subnetting\nthing licked here, okay?\n\n219\n00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.310\nWhat you want to do is you want to\ncreate your own questions if you can.\n\n220\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.390\nMake sure you understand the binary,\nand the conversions, and\n\n221\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.020\nthe idea of subnetting.\n\n222\n00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.200\nYour goal is to take like all ten\nof those questions that we have and\n\n223\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.130\nbe able to answer each one in a minute or\nless.\n\n224\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.570\nNow, obviously, I didn't do that\nduring our subnetting practices here,\n\n225\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.390\nbecause I was trying to explain to you\nthe logic and how I would attack it\n\n226\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.630\non the exam if I didn't know how\nto spot them very quickly, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.850\nSo, use the simple\nmethods that you do know.\n\n228\n00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.310\nEliminate the answers that\nare wrong right away.\n\n229\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.525\nAnd just focus in on\nthe ones that may be right.\n\n230\n00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:50.280\nSo don't take a lot of\ntime trying to figure out\n\n231\n00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.830\nwhether every single\none is actually right.\n\n232\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.410\nIf they only ask you for two,\nremember that means you can eliminate two.\n\n233\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.390\nSo try and eliminate those two right away.\n\n234\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.330\nIf it takes you a little bit longer,\nthat's fine.\n\n235\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.060\nBut where it should take you the longest\ntime is during your preparation and\n\n236\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.630\nlooking at these questions as well and\nlooking at different question that you can\n\n237\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.220\nfind and\neven creating your own questions, too.\n\n238\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.410\nAnd that way, you'll be better up on the\npractice and being able to identify that.\n\n239\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.960\nThe more that you can see\nthese numbers and see this,\n\n240\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.390\nit will help you out as you get ready for\nthe exam.\n\n241\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.080\nSo make sure you are practicing subnetting\nat this point on a daily basis and\n\n242\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.310\ndo not let that go all the way\nthrough your time of study together.\n\n243\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.840\nAnd that way you'll engrain and you'll\nstart seeing the patterns in your head,\n\n244\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.700\nand you'll be able to tackle problems\nlike this very easily without\n\n245\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.380\nvery little thought of you having\nto write the binary at all.\n\n246\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.530\nBut if you have to do it now,\nthis is the best time to do it.\n\n247\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.930\nOn the exam,\nyou're going to waste a lot of time and\n\n248\n00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.820\nyou don't have time to waste there.\n\n249\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.360\nSo, do take some time and\ndo the practice now, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.520\nAnd also, of course,\nwith our command lines you're learning,\n\n251\n00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.060\nmake sure you continue to practice those,\ntoo.\n\n252\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.540\nSo that's about it and that means that we\nare ready to sign off for this episode.\n\n253\n00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.007\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n254\n00:15:06.007 --> 00:15:13.932\n[MUSIC]\n\n255\n00:15:13.932 --> 00:15:16.573\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
