in.\n\n3\n00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:14.283\nWe wanna make sure that you understood\nsome of the different details behind\n\n4\n00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:18.370\nalso getting ready for the exam and also\nwhat we'll be covering in this series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.800\nSo let's take a look at my desktop\nhere that will help us to see.\n\n6\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.420\nWhen we start off and we start taking a\nlook at the idea of doing the Cisco CCENT\n\n7\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.620\nshow, we wanna make sure that you\nare getting prepared for the right exam.\n\n8\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.520\nWhen you take a look at that, the exam\nnumber that you'll need, is that this show\n\n9\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.490\nis in preparation for exam 100-105\nICND1 is the actual exam name.\n\n10\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.200\nAnd our show is gonna be named,\nof course, Cisco CCENT,\n\n11\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.810\nin the idea of making sure that\nthey're all aligned together.\n\n12\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.200\nNow this exam though,\n\n13\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.790\nis gonna be about 90 minutes long, covers\nanywhere between 45 to 55 questions.\n\n14\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.455\nHave you worked that out?\n\n15\n00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.490\nIt's a little bit over an minute\nper question but not much.\n\n16\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.280\nSo, you want to make sure you\ntake requirement a bit seriously\n\n17\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.690\nbecause Cisco exams are notorious.\n\n18\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.280\nWhere the idea of not only of course do\nyou need to get the answers right but\n\n19\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.920\nof course you need to get them\nright very quickly as well.\n\n20\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880\nSo make sure you understand that\nbefore you go into the exam too.\n\n21\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.090\nNow as we start to get ready for that\nexam day and you're ready to go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.000\ntake this, you're gonna sign\nup at a Pearson VUE Center.\n\n23\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.810\nAnd you wanna make sure that you go\nthrough and you'll create your own\n\n24\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.560\nCisco ID, make sure that you get\nregistered for the proper exam.\n\n25\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.925\nAnd this is where you'll need that\nexam number that you'll be able to do,\n\n26\n00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:36.640\nthen you follow the instructions.\n\n27\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.370\nFind your nearest Pearson VUE\ntesting center to help you out.\n\n28\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.230\nNow as far as the exam costs go, I'm gonna\nclick on a different page to help us out.\n\n29\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.380\nAs of March 2017, so a little bit over a\nyear ago as of the recording of this show,\n\n30\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.740\nwe'll end up seeing that the exam\ncosts have actually changed over time.\n\n31\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.290\nAnd when we start looking at it, it's a\nproctored exam beginning with 100 and also\n\n32\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.244\nof course the 200 series here and when you\nsee that in US dollars, it's about $165.\n\n33\n00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:13.838\nNow if you happen to be in other places\naround the world, make sure you check and\n\n34\n00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:18.224\nthe easiest way to check the cost of this\nis gonna be through your Pearson VUE\n\n35\n00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:23.390\nwebsite to make sure that you get all\nthe actual right details ready to go too.\n\n36\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.980\nAlso, make sure you show up for\nthe testing, about 15 minutes early.\n\n37\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150\nBring the form of ID that you need to,\nas they ask you to do so and\n\n38\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.180\nthen get ready to test for\nthe exam as well.\n\n39\n00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.670\nSo what are some of the topics we'll\nbe covering inside of our series?\n\n40\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.700\nIt's gonna be based officially off of\ncourse, the objectives themselves.\n\n41\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.350\nAnd if you're saying, well, where are the\nexam objectives, if you just simply use\n\n42\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.450\nyour favorite search engine and\nyou type in Cisco exam 100-105,\n\n43\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.700\nit will probably lead\nyou to this web page.\n\n44\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.700\nAnd on this web page,\nyou'll end up seeing that there is a link\n\n45\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.660\ndown here where it says\nreview the exam topics.\n\n46\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.800\nWhen you click on that link, then it will\ngive you a list of topics which you can\n\n47\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.510\nnow download for a complete list\nof the topics in a PDF format.\n\n48\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.240\nWhen you do that, here's what\nthe download will bring you to.\n\n49\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.970\nIt will, of course,\nbring you to a breakdown of the exam\n\n50\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.850\nby the percentages here and\ntell you some of the same information.\n\n51\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.014\nNow you'll actually see\nthat is an assessment,\n\n52\n00:03:25.014 --> 00:03:28.037\nthat's gonna be 45 to 55 questions,\nabout 90 minutes here.\n\n53\n00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:32.130\nAnd you wanna make sure that you pay\nattention to each one of these topics.\n\n54\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.230\nSo during our show, we'll make sure that\nwe cover all of the actual networking\n\n55\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.540\nfundamentals which will account for\nabout a fifth of the exam itself.\n\n56\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.860\nWhich of course begins with the OSI and\nTCP model comparisons.\n\n57\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.654\nWe of course will break down and make sure\nthat we cover networking fundamentals,\n\n58\n00:03:49.654 --> 00:03:53.620\nas much as we can, to get you prepared for\nthe exam that comes along.\n\n59\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.054\nAlso, we'll be heading\nLAN Switching Fundamentals,\n\n60\n00:03:57.054 --> 00:04:02.096\nwhich of course includes understanding\nthe idea of various switching concepts,\n\n61\n00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.300\nthe Ethernet frame format as well.\n\n62\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.851\nOf course even some cabling\nissues that you'll run across,\n\n63\n00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:12.900\nbasic VLAN configuration, as well as\nconnecting the multiple switches too.\n\n64\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.920\nAnd you'll see that there's a lot of\ndifferent information in here that will be\n\n65\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.430\ncovering as we go on through the show.\n\n66\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.930\nOnce we get through that, of course\nthere will be routing fundamentals.\n\n67\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.450\nWe'll be using RIP primarily to help us\nunderstand the concept of routing but\n\n68\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.200\nalso, as our initial dynamic routing\nprotocol configurations too,\n\n69\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.210\nas well as we'll be handling\nstatic routing information.\n\n70\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.310\nWe'll also be doing some inter-VLAN\nrouting during that show and\n\n71\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.360\neven IPv6 routing,\nwe'll talk about that briefly too.\n\n72\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.381\nSo you'll see a lot of other\nthings are also included in there.\n\n73\n00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:48.915\nOnce we're done with the concept of\nrouting and switching, as far as the basic\n\n74\n00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:53.588\ntopic, we'll talk about of course\ninfrastructure services that also exists,\n\n75\n00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:56.767\nDNS and DHCP are kind of\nthe two basic ones you'll see.\n\n76\n00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:59.292\nAnd we've course what she set that up for\nus,\n\n77\n00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:03.320\nas well as the labs as we walk through\nall these different concepts too.\n\n78\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.010\nWe'll configure NTP, our network\ntime protocol, as well as NAT for\n\n79\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.680\nnetwork address translation, that will\nbe a big part of what we'll be covering.\n\n80\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.377\nAnd then lastly, we'll talk about\nsome infrastructure maintenance.\n\n81\n00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:17.810\nThroughout in the entire series, we'll\nprobably be using some of the different\n\n82\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.750\ntechnologies that we'll be covering\nhere in this bit domain objective.\n\n83\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.130\nTo make sure and\nthen we'll review them at the end,\n\n84\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.930\nwhere there's actually a lot of different\nprotocols and some of the different device\n\n85\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.080\nconfigurations that you\nneed to know about.\n\n86\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.267\nIn terms of securing the device and making\nsure that you know how to maintain them,\n\n87\n00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.189\nas well as do things like backups and\npassword recovery.\n\n88\n00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:42.000\nSo all these are actually\na part of the CCENT exam.\n\n89\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.535\nNow remember for this exam, it doesn't\nrequire you to have any other professional\n\n90\n00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.084\ncertification knowledge\nas you go into this.\n\n91\n00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:51.684\nSo there's no prerequisite or\nrequirement but\n\n92\n00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:56.560\nit does require you to have a strong\nformation in basic networking right away.\n\n93\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.480\nSo if you do not have that, it is\nrecommended of course that you go ahead\n\n94\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.180\nand that you take a look at getting some\nof that knowledge set before you start.\n\n95\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.181\nBut we'll be covering a lot of it\nas a review at the very beginning,\n\n96\n00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:12.116\nas it does cover a big\nportion of the exam as well.\n\n97\n00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:15.764\nOr another basic topic, right, that we\ndefinitely need to discuss in which\n\n98\n00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:17.954\nwe will discuss in depth\nwill be subnetting.\n\n99\n00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:21.020\nSo we'll make sure that you\nunderstand how to subnet,\n\n100\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.110\nas well as how to actually get\nfaster at doing subnetting as well.\n\n101\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.460\nWhich is probably one of the main and\n\n102\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.760\nprobably one of the hardest concepts\nthat you'll have to be able to do\n\n103\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.480\nat a proficient level on\nthe CCENT exam too, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.890\nSo, if you are getting prepared for\nyour Cisco CCENT exam,\n\n105\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.630\nmake sure you watch this episode and that\nyou review the concepts that are here.\n\n106\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.420\nAnd if you are ready to get started,\n\n107\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.990\nall you have to do is click\non the next video link.\n\n108\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.828\nThank you for joining us.\n\n109\n00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:54.986\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
